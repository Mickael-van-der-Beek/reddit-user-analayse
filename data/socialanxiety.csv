1350757268.0,139,self.socialanxiety,11t20o,"I almost chickened out about 5 times, but last night I ended up going to a rave by myself! Had an awesome time and met a really cute girl!",redditSAthrowaway,154,15,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/11t20o/i_almost_chickened_out_about_5_times_but_last/,"I ran into a facebook event for a rave about two hours before it actually started. I listened to the band playing on myspace and thought about how awesome it would be to go there. A promotional youtube video make it look absolutely awesome. Then the anxiety started creeping in.

""Only weirdoes go to raves alone""

""You will sweat everywhere and probably have bad B.O. if you dance all night""

""You look like a moron when you dance. What do you even do with your arms?""

""Just stay home and play Civilization III by yourself. You deserve some relaxation and nostalgia""

""You don't have a car. You'll have to take your bike and it's supposed to rain tonight.""

I had to watch the promotional video like 4 or 5 times to amp myself up enough to purchase a ticket. (The anxious part of my brain was wishing that it was sold out).

So I ride my bike out to the place and end up wandering around the neighborhood for about 20 minutes because the gps on my phone sucks and the entrance was tucked away in some corner of a building. I remember the anxiety coming back.

""You've searched enough. You tried. Just get on your bike and go home""

I did manage to find the place eventually. When I got in, I went into the main floor. Not many people were there yet and they were just lounging around waiting for the main act to start. I got nervous and went to the bathroom. I ended up locking myself in a bathroom stall for probably 5-10 minutes (a strategy I'm all too familiar with). My anxiety started talking to me again. 

""You managed to come all the way here. That's good enough. You can go home now""

I started thinking about avoidance strategies and how whenever my anxiety crept in I would always do what it said pretty much no matter what in order to avoid more anxiety. I told myself that going back out there would be good for me and finally opened up the stall door and went back.

I stood near the back and watched a few of the performances. I also noticed quite a few other people standing by themselves. Overtime, some of them met with their friends, but there were still some completely alone. This made me feel quite a bit better and it also made me start thinking that I'm not the only person on the planet who feels anxiety.

The main act came on stage and told everyone to get close so I did. We were pretty much shoulder to shoulder a few feet from the stage. I noticed that some people were dancing and really into it, and some people were just halfway dancing or just bobbing their heads. The funniest part was, I noticed that the people who were flailing around and losing themselves in the music looked a lot less silly than the people with their hands in their pockets just bobbing their heads up and down. It took quite a bit of effort and time, but after a while I was jumping up and down and putting my hands in the air.

One cool person I noticed was a man around 50 years old. He was dancing just as hard as the 20 year olds. He really didn't care what other people thought of him, he was just there for the experience. That really helped to open me up a bit as well.

After a while I ran into this really cute girl. We were dancing next to each other for a little while and then she suggested we go somewhere more quite and talk. I went outside with her and we talked for a long time. I got her phone number, but my mind was still saying she just wanted to hang out, she wasn't looking for anything more. I really wanted to kiss her but I was so afraid of what would happen if I failed.

""You came to a rave all alone and now you're trying to kiss this girl who might not even be into you. You're a freaking creeper and she will know it if you try to kiss her. She's just trying to make a new friend, not get groped by some sex pervert.""

So we went back inside and danced some more. When the event ended I met a few of her friends and then I went outside with her. I gave her a big hug and told her goodbye. I remember when our hug ended our faces were so close. She was so pretty I wanted to kiss her so badly, but my mind just kept playing some scenario where she would push me away and say ""I just wanted you as a friend. But if you can't even control myself I'm not even going to be your friend. Don't call me""

I exchanged one or two more sentences with her, because I didn't want the moment to end. I hugged her again and our faces were so close together. I don't know what made me do it, but I just put my face closer to hers and kissed her. We kissed for two or three seconds then she pulled back and said she didn't want to do anything more in public. I said that was fine, kissed her one more time, then we parted ways.

I remember on my bike ride home just thinking about my night. I almost let my anxiety get the better of me and wasted my night playing video games. Had I not gone out I would not have danced around, partied with a 50 year old man, heard an awesome band, met and kissed a really great girl, and most of all overcome my fears. I know that even though I won a battle last night, the war is still raging. I will still feel anxiety in the future and I will have to overcome that anxiety. But for that bike ride home, I had no anxiety. He didn't have anything to say. I did the exact opposite of what he suggested and ended up having an amazing night. I made that little bitch eat his words.

Social anxiety is a disorder and it's not uncommon to have other anxiety disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder, as well.

If you're like me, you live with this every day of your life. Some days you feel defeated or exhausted and some days or weeks may feel the opposite.

For the benefit of keeping this short, I want to tell you something that I've realised from talking to people that aren't socially anxious. 

I'm afraid of swimming out in the ocean, but I have an open water scuba divers license. I'm afraid of public speaking but I used to train staff at my old job. I've jumped out of a plane and bungee jumped off a perfectly good bridge. I felt as afraid doing all of that, as I did doing a speech at a wedding.

I've talked to plenty of people about some of these things and they've often said how they 'could never do that'. Somehow I end up coming across as some adrenaline junkie.

What's my point? Some of the people you admire for being open and the life of the party will flat out refuse to face their fears. Maybe they can't swim, are afraid of climbing ladders or are scared of horses.

But you have to face your fear every day. Every day that you can and every day that you challenge it, you get a little bit stronger. Every time you succeed by not letting anxiety overcome you, you're more capable. Sure, you've struggled and we all have... but eventually you've looked your fear in the eye and did it any way. 

When you realise the strength and the courage that it takes to do that, you realise there isn't anything holding you back from going out there and doing any awesome thing that frightens and excites you. That's the opposite of being fearless but the result can be the same for you. Think about it...

I got this girls number through this friend, but this friend also gave this chick my number. This chick orignally texted me first and we have been texting back and forth over the past month with her starting about half of our text conversations. I thought she showed some really good signs that she liked more than just as a friend.  But I guess I was wrong. At least, I finally worked up the nerve and finally asked her out on a date.

I knew right away that I should contact her because we had common interests and I was actually curious to know more about her, but the very thought of stepping outside my comfort zone made me close the window immediately. It just so happens that I was listening to some music at the time and the very next song that came up was 'Under Pressure' (on of my favorite Queen songs). ""Fuck it,"" I thought to myself and logged back on, found her profile again and started typing a short message asking if she's seen some other movies that I like. By the time I was done typing I started to get second thoughts. That is, until I realized that 'I Want it All' was now playing. ""Fuck it,"" I thought again. Even if she's not interested, I will at least have tried to jump over the hurdle.

The build-up: Well, not only did she reply, but we actually started talking about other interests and after a month or so we even exchanged names. Things were going well and last week I decided that it was time for me to take the next step. I asked her if she would be interested in going out for coffee. There was a place in town where we could go and view some artwork afterwards (she's a very creative and artistic person). Well, the very next day she replied with a 'yes' and her phone number! I contacted her and we sent a few texts to arrange plans to meet up for coffee the next day. As happy as I was, I was also terrified that my anxiety would overwhelm me and ruin everything. I had a LOT of ""What if"" thoughts, but I kept telling myself that I can't predict the future and those things are highly unlikely to happen. When I felt a wave of anxiety approach, I would focus on my breathing and tell myself to live in the moment. Luckily I was busy the rest of the day when we made plans and that helped me keep my mind off of things. But the next day was really hard because it was the only thing on my mind. I could barely even finish a light lunch without feeling nauseous!

Meeting her: I made sure to show up early to the coffee shop and find a nice seat outside where I could relax and get used to the setting before she showed up. Luckily there was no one else sitting outside and very little foot traffic around the area. I didn't have to worry about giving a bunch of strangers front row seats to watch me fail at a first date (not that that is a likely scenario, I reminded myself). I checked the time, she's a few minutes late. I noticed my hand was shaking a little. ""Well, it's not a noticeable shake,"" I thought as I leaned back in my chair. ""Just breathe."" A few minutes later, there she is! I stand up and walk toward her while we exchange pleasantries. It's a little awkward, but I'm here and this is happening. We walk inside and I order our drinks. I even managed to put the change neatly back in my wallet without my hand noticeably shaking!
Back outside we start talking about our weekends and I'm surprised at how I well I'm able to keep the conversation going. When there's a pause, I think of a question that is somewhat related to what we were just talking about, but leads the conversation into a fresh area. When we finish our drinks, I ask if she would still like to browse the art nearby. She says yes and we get up. I take our mugs back into the shop and we start walking. I have a bit of a hard time thinking of anything to say at that point, but I manage to start up something that we were talking about earlier. ""Better than awkward silence,"" I thought.

At this point we've started looking at the paintings and suddenly realize that I have absolutely nothing to say about any of this. That is, until we get to a group of small animal paintings at the very end of the hall and she makes a comment about how surprised one of the cows looks. I suddenly see an opportunity! I make a joke about how the duck in the next painting is eying the cow very slyly. Then we start joking that the other animal next to the cow looks a little shady too. There's more animals on the other wall, another worried cow and two more shady looking ducks. And two goats that look like they were going to help the cow but are now turning around after they saw the ducks. We start joking about things going down on this farm and I even made a stupid joke about a gang gaggle of ducks, or ""a gangle, if you will."" I make jokes like these a lot and was surprised when she laughed the loudest yet! From that point we were able to keep talking about some of the other paintings and I felt a lot more at ease. 

Eventually we ran out of paintings to look at and started making our way back to the parking lot. We passed a few cars and I kept wondering when we would reach her's while we kept talking about our favorite things. Well, we passed the parking lot now and I realized that she's in no hurry to leave! We just kept talking and walking around for at least another hour. There were a few points where a pause in the conversation started getting too long and I couldn't think of anything to say. She seemed to notice this and initiated conversation herself when that happened. Eventually, we passed the parking lot for the third or fourth time and went our separate ways. But before we said goodby, she asked if I had any plans for next weekend! I told her not yet, but I would definitely be interested in doing something and would be in contact. Once I reached my car, I checked the time and was surprised to find we had been talking for two and a half hours without any major awkward moments! There are only a select few people on this Earth that I can talk to for that long without saying something awkward or running out of things to talk about.

Anyway, I just wanted to get this off of my chest since it's such a huge victory for me!

As for some background, I've known this girl for arround 8 months as we go to the same college. She's truly an amazing person; extremely nice, intelligent, focused, pretty, elegant and not even a little bit arrogant.

I was dazzled since I met her, since she's one of those truly nice people that will sit next to you and talk to you even if you're the loner and awkward guy (she did that with me).

Since then I've made several attempts to get close to her that I honestly never tought I would even try, while I have seen some signs that perhaps could be interpreted as some small interest of her in me, I honestly think it's just her being nice as she is to everyone. I don't blame her for not being interested in me, while I do believe I'm a good human being with a lot to give, this disease has taken too much from me and I've only spent less than 2 years truly trying to overcome it.

The points is that... I tried, I honestly tried. I wasn't scared, just excited even tought I knew my odds were really bad, I am just tired of being alone but I'm even more tired of sitting on my ass and not even trying to change that. But this time was different, I tried, I may not be ready yet, I may still be too far from the kind of person that a girl like that would like but as long as there is life there's a chance to improve and maybe in 5 years or something like that I will be ready and when I find someone like that again I won't even hesitate to try and get close.

My advice to all of you is to quite simply live. Try to get what you want, even if you're almost sure that you will fail it's still better than just being a coward. I enjoyed the experience of trying to get close to her, even if nothing came out of it, it made me feel a little more alive and that's just priceless for people like us.",,False,,t5_2r22n,False,,,True,t3_19xn3t,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/19xn3t/yestarday_i_asked_a_girl_i_really_like_to_go_out/,

Don't get me wrong -- I'm not by any means ""cured,"" but today was wonderful.

President Obama came to Fort Bliss, today, where my husband is stationed. I was very excited to see his speech and, despite having severe anxiety issues with big crowds, I decided I was going to go no matter what.

There were some pretty tough parts. A lot of the time I was standing around awkwardly, with horrible feelings in my stomach and a strong urge to bolt, but I made it through (for the first time in so long, I didn't bolt!).

By the time the president spoke, I was worn out, and so less anxious. Afterwards, however, when I realized we'd have a chance to speak to the President and shake his hand, I was energized. There was not an ounce of anxiety in me. I was so unbelievably excited that I was leaning against a small barrier, with Secret Service agents directly in front of me, bouncing and grinning like a child. When the President got to me and my husband I looked him in the eye, shook his hand and said, ""Thank you, Mr. President,"" and he thanked me, and then moved on.

Immediately, my husband looked at me and laughed, which horrified me. I asked, ""What?"" terrified I'd done something awful, and he said, ""You just look so happy."" I felt crushed, like I'd looked stupid, or foolish, (and the president saw!) but I quickly pushed that away and realized, no, I looked happy because I *was* happy. I was not worried, or thinking of how I was appearing to others, I was just deep within, what felt to me, a spectacular moment.

I'm so happy, not just because this happened, but because it felt so freeing. To be honest, I'm just really proud of myself. I'm very hopeful that social anxiety will become less and less dominating in my life until it exists mostly as a remnant of the past.

Thank you for reading!

And, for good measure, a photo! I know it's blurry, and I know I'm smiling up at only half of Obama's head, but I feel like it encapsulates pretty well just how giddy and uninhibited this moment was for me.

I used to stay in my house all day, caged in with fear and anxiety. I had little to no friends. The few friends I did have, I didn't even connect with. I felt like I couldn't connect with anyone.

I used to be deathly afraid of posting on Reddit too. Even being anonymous didn't make a difference, I was still scared. I had a job, but I would skip days. One day I drove all the way to work, was too scared to go in, turned around and went back home. This was only ~2 years ago. When people called I would let it go to voicemail. I took such a long time to reply back to emails....if I ever did. I was just too nervous. I was convinced I was broken and unfixable.

But all that is pretty much gone now. If you point somebody out and tell me to go ask them something, I'll go up and do it instantly. I fret a lot less about the smaller things. I flirted with a cute store employee just now not even 2 hours ago. My phone which used to pretty much get no action regularly receives text messages and calls now. I used to be scared of going to the gym, I've put on like 10 pounds of muscle now. My fear of posting on Reddit is gone too, I have a bunch of accounts and I post regularly. I'm doing this too, which a couple years ago would be unfathomable.

I was able to do all this through meditation, education, dedication, ""medication ;)"", some therapy, and of course, with all the wonderful help from Reddit. It was NOT easy.

1370388406.0,76,self.socialanxiety,1foopn,My SA paid off for me in a big way today.,foreveralonegirl7,80,4,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1foopn/my_sa_paid_off_for_me_in_a_big_way_today/,"TL;DR I got a new job about a month ago. Two weeks in some of the temps were making fun of me for being so quiet. The temps got fired. Boss came up to me today and said that he and the higher ups have been watching me and that I was valuable to the company. I'm going to be training to use some machines next week. My pay may increase by up to 4 dollars.

I posted a while ago about how I was having a hard time getting an interview or any call backs from jobs I applied at. I went through a temp agency after posting my resume online and getting a call from them. I got hired a few weeks later after moving to a different town. They set me up on a third shift factory job. This being the first job I had in about 5 months I really appreciated finally having a job. I don't have a car so I had to walk two hours to and back from my job for the first couple days. I got pretty good at my job (assembly) and started trying to do double what was expected of me an hour (all of our numbers are recorded). 

Two weeks later two new temps were hired on to help during the night shift they were very talkative and kind of were the embodiment of scumbag steve. They tried talking to me a few times but were a little less than understanding. I finally just told them that I had SA. Surprisingly after that they left me alone BUT they still had quite a bit to gossip about with me and many other people who worked at the company. One was let go after a week for calling in too many times and the other for harassing a HR manager. 

I met (by met I mean I painfully planned out everything I was going to say to them in advance including my facial expressions - I wanted to appear to be the friendliest mofo on the planet) a few people that are permanent employees of the company and am now known as ""the shy girl"" which is much better than being confused as a conceited bitch (as the temp referred to me as). 

My supervisor and boss wanted to talk to me today at first I was really scared because I had been about five minutes late a few days prior BUT NOPE they just wanted to let me know that I was the most awesome and polite temp ever and that they wanted to take me on as a temp-to-hire. In my bosses words ""We really like having you here. You do your job and you do it well. Most of the temps we have to let go because they want a job but they want a job that they don't have to work at. I would like to start training you on the machines."" So basically my SA made it so I didn't socialize so much and made me feel 10x more motivated to do my job well because I opportunities to have a job where I can work alone don't come around often. Now I'm going to temp-to-hire once I'm hired on I can actually be a real adult :P with insurance, vacations, and a other things that are pretty neat like the extra 3-4 dollars an hour. 

There are a lot of things about having SA that I absolutely hate but this is one of the times where I'm glad that I have it. ",,False,,t5_2r22n,False,,,True,t3_1foopn,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1foopn/my_sa_paid_off_for_me_in_a_big_way_today/,
1365535355.0,76,self.socialanxiety,1c0boz,How I overcame my social anxiety. 3 Simple steps.,andy013,91,15,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1c0boz/how_i_overcame_my_social_anxiety_3_simple_steps/,"[EDIT] I recommend you read my replies to the comments as well as this post since they are full of useful information and will give you some examples of how to go about challenging your beliefs. 

    .

For years I have suffered from social anxiety. I would always avoid interacting with other people and I generally had low self-esteem and felt like no one liked me. I have made dramatic progress and really feel that now I have overcame this problem and can socialize with people normally.         

    .
Over the last 5-6 years I have read probably 200 books on self-esteem and social anxiety. I have went to 3 different CBT therapists on separate occasions as well. Ultimately though it was through my own determination and hard work that I managed to overcome this problem. I feel like this is a problem that you really need to take responsibility for yourself, other people can guide and help you but you are the one that will determine how successful you are. 

    .
Okay, so here is what I have learned: Social Anxiety is the **fear of social rejection** (other people disliking you or looking down on you). Every human being is afraid of social rejection, but most don't think it is a likely thing to happen on a daily basis. Just the same as everyone is afraid of falling but not everyone is afraid of heights.  


If you feel like you will be socially rejected then you will feel anxiety. Just like if you feel unsafe up a tall tower you will probably feel fear. The difference is that a person with an irrational fear of heights thinks that even climbing a ladder that is perfectly safe will result in them falling and so they feel anxious and/or avoid climbing it. 


    .
The **first step** to overcoming your social anxiety is to **identify what rules you have for avoiding social rejection**. Everyone believes different things that is why there is no one size fits all cure for social anxiety. 

Here are some examples of what it might be (you may also have more than one rule), 

* ""I MUST be good at small talk or else everyone will think I'm a loser."" 
* ""I MUST not be shy or else people will think I'm pathetic."" 
* ""I MUST not be unattractive or everyone will hate me.""
* ""I MUST be funny or else people will get bored with me."" 

The best way to discover what your rules are is to reflect on social situations and ask yourself what you were trying to avoid. What did you think would lead to others rejecting you and thinking negatively about you?


    .

The **second step** is to **challenge these rules and come up with a viable alternative way of looking at the world**. Sometimes it can be very difficult to see any alternative explanation for what you believe. You might just FEEL like your current rule is true and there is no doubt in your mind. E.g. ""I just KNOW if I am bad at small talk everyone will think I'm a pathetic worm!"". Generally there is always some element of truth to them, for example being funnier might make other people like you more, but that doesn't mean if you aren't funny they will completely dislike you. 

    .
**I am willing to help anyone who wants me to come up with some alternative ways of looking at the situation. Just post your rule in the comments or PM me and I will respond and help to challenge it.**

    .
It's important to note that it can be difficult for other people to challenge your thinking effectively because only you know the full reasoning behind it. Often you might come up with an alternative and then you'll feel your brain going, ""Yeah, but...."" and arguing with it. That's good. This process involves argument with your current beliefs to try and show yourself that another way of looking at them could be true. It's no good if you just say ""Actually being bad at small talk is fine, people will still like me."" if you don't believe it. You have to believe it and see it as a viable alternative explanation. 

If you post your rule and I respond and then you feel yourself saying ""yea, but..."" then post that as a reply too! Often it can take some back and forth before you get to a point where you can believe the alternative might be true. 

    .
Once you have a viable alternative way of looking at the world. It can be useful to write down your current belief and then challenge it by writing out the alternative explanation. It can also be useful to focus on specific events in your life. So for example, if you go out and talk to a girl and you are nervous and you feel it goes badly. Write down your current belief about what you thought she thought of you, and then write out the alternative way of looking at that situation. Doing this type of written exercise often can really help to see things in a different way. 



    .

The **third step** is to go out into the world and **test your new way of looking at things**. This means risking doing what you are afraid of. So if you are afraid of being bad at small talk, you go out and PUSH yourself to get into conversations with people and have small talk. During this and after when you are reflecting on this situation you always want to be trying to view the world through your new belief. Your brain will probably start thinking in the old way, ""OMG I so bad at small talk, she thinks I'm a complete idiot!"", but you need to fight with it and constantly practice looking at things differently. 

    .
Often what can happen is that once you form a belief you view the world as if it is true. So if you really believe that being bad at small talk will get you rejected, you view the world as if that is true. You might talk to someone and be very nervous and because you are nervous you come across a bit awkward and it doesn't go so well, but then you use that as evidence to support your fear. It's like someone being afraid of climbing a ladder, so they do all these safety behaviours like going really slow and holding on very tight. But perhaps holding on tight and shaking from fear makes the ladder start to rock and then they jump off and claim ""See, I knew I was going to fall off, my fear was valid!"" when in reality it was the fear itself that was causing the problem and if they had just climbed up the ladder without all the safety behaviours then everything would have been fine. 

The same is true for social anxiety. Often your safety behaviours can result in you becoming more alienated and suppressing your own natural ability to socialize, and then you use that as evidence that your fear of rejection was valid. 

    .

It's important to note that both the second step and the third step need to go together, they won't work separately. If you just challenge your thinking but never push yourself to take a risk in a social situation you will always be afraid. If you just push yourself in social situations without having an alternative way of looking at things then it is very likely that you will view things as if your fear is true and find evidence for it where none exists - reinforcing your fear. 

    .


Putting all three of these steps together will have a dramatic impact in your confidence and social ability. It takes time, but if you persist and work hard then you will overcome this fear.

But over time I've been trying to force myself out of my comfort zone when it comes to social engagements... Not all the time, but often enough that it tests me. 

An acquaintance of mine that I've never really hung out with one-on-one didn't have anyone to go to this party with, so for whatever reason he chose me. Because, you know, I'm such a party animal (heh). Not wanting to miss the chance to strengthen things with this acquaintance, I swallowed my fear of going to a party of strangers and said yes.

I considered cancelling multiple times. I tried to stay away from my phone, lest I impulsively text him something along the lines of ""hey, I can't go, I have a.... thing.""

The ride there was a bit awkward, because I don't know the acquaintance very well. But the conversation went more and more smoothly, and by the time we got there I was feeling pretty good. 

There were about 30 people there when we arrived. My heart sank. I wanted to do my party usual and just sit in a chair in the corner and watch things and drink... But that never ends up well, as I'm sure a lot of you have figured out by now too. I kept the drinking to a minimum, not wanting to make a fool out of myself, and did the unthinkable: I introduced myself to someone. He was wearing a shirt of a band I like, so I talked to him a bit about it. The conversation flowed easily from there. 

Then I met the host, and introduced myself because that's the polite thing to do. Someone overheard me introducing myself, and they introduced themselves. The guy with the band shirt came back over and said ""I want you to meet a couple people"" and introduced me to them. I  was trying really hard to be lighthearted and act carefree and not nervous, but after a while it wasn't even an act. People saw that I looked cool and would come over to say ""hey, who the hell are you because I haven't seen you here before."" People were offering me drinks left and right, but I turned them down, which I usually don't do. But I've found that alcohol and social anxiety, contrary to what some might think, do not mix.

I bluntly told people I didn't really know anyone there, and I was happy to meet new people. After talking in depth with a few people, I said ""You guys are cool; I'm glad I got a chance to meet you guys."" It sounded stupid, but people appreciated the compliment and the bluntness. By the end, I wouldn't say I made any lasting friendships, but I had a couple people asking for my facebook and saying they were looking forward to seeing me at another party.

I didn't feel like myself at all. Even GOING to the party isn't something I would do. But you know what? It turned out fine, and even though I said a few stupid things, no one cared and I didn't dwell on it too much. I didn't need alcohol to help me loosen up and talk to people, I just went ahead and did it. I figured, you know what's less intimidating than a roomful of strangers? A roomful of people, half of which you've introduced yourself to, most of whom seem pretty cool and have told you they were happy to meet you.

If the crowd got too much, I went into the bathroom to collect myself, or outside to get some fresh air. 

I just wanted to share, because I couldn't believe I did that and that last night went so well. I definitely have no regrets about doing that, and now my acquaintance thinks I'm ""awesome to bring along to parties."" Me! When he said that I wanted to burst out laughing.

Basically, unless absolutely necessary I don't use anyone's name. It started when I was a kid and wasn't sure if friends' parents preferred me to use their first or last name, so I wound up just not calling them anything. 

Now, as an adult, addressing people with their names implies familiarity that I rarely feel. It's almost like I haven't earned the privilege to use names. 

Does this make sense?

This is not my standard account since I'm paranoid. Anyways, I've always been even more scared to enter social situations online than IRL (forums, chat, comments, etc) which most people don't understand.  
When I joined Reddit recently I hoped that it could be my chance to overcome this. Such a diverse place, where I choose from thousands of topics that interest me.

I've only commented about 10 times with my other account. Always with an enormous amount of anxiety and reloading every 30th second to see if people downvote me. There have been some downvotes but always with more upvotes.

Today I felt brave. I have made 3 comments, all with okay results, which made me feel somewhat more confident. Finally I took the step and submitted a question to AskReddit with the hopes for at least some answers. I got a few comments, and got really excited, but then I saw that I had three times as many downvotes as upvotes. 
PANIC! People hate me!

And for some reason my post seems to be gone from new, which makes me even more paranoid.

I don't know what I did wrong. Perhaps my question was stupid or irrelevant. Maybe people just felt I don't fit in enough. Maybe it's because of my grammatical errors since English is not my native language. I don't know. Now I'm extremely scared to keep using Reddit. Writing this has me shaking.


Sorry for the rambling.

It started out about baseball tickets then transitioned to her brother (who she was buying the tickets for) and how she worried for him because he has always lived with their parents.

I told her that it is indeed very difficult to change - and shared that due to my own severe social anxiety I found myself house-bound and living with my parents until I was about 30.

She looked flabbergasted.

I explained that I began having anxiety issues and severe panic attacks in my early 20s virtually out of nowhere and that I have fought through to get to what I consider a strong spot right now.

Her response: ""Not you! Really? I can't believe that. Really?""

I assured her it was true.

""I never would have thought that, you are so out going and friendly. Good for you!""

I tell this story for a few reasons..

First, it feels damn good to get that compliment!

Second, don't ever give up. It isn't easy to push through and find a 
light on the other side, but it is possible. I still have my battles, but I see much more sunshine these days.

Finally, don't ever be ashamed to be who you are and be battling what you have been.

I saw an empty line but for a second I thought it looked like my cart wouldn't fit there (in the end it was a tight squeeze in my defence...) so I kept walking and wandered around the store for another 5 minutes until I could make another pass. There was another painfully awkward moment when I got to the cash but you get the idea. 

So ya, this is all humiliating and I'm ashamed to admit it but this is what my life is like. Whenever I'm in a store half the time I'm acting/pretending to shop and planning my next move like a maniac. Would you even call this social anxiety or have I moved beyond that at this point?

Today I really realized a have trouble showing affection. I'm not sure if it is part of my social anxiety or not. One of my friends told me this about me a while ago and I didn't think much of it, but today it really bothered me. I could not tell my mom I loved her on Mother's Day. I feel like a monster. I just couldn't do it, BUT I WANTED TO SO BAD. I couldn't tell my grandmother I loved her either. I could t even type it out in a text or email. So now I'm thinking, WTF is wrong with me? I'm uncomfortable telling my parents I love them, even though they are so important to me. I can't even tell my friends I love them or that I even appreciate their friendship. I would not feel comfortable hugging one of my friends. I feel like I need to change this but I don't know what to do....
I was wondering if any of you can relate?

The whole process of phoning up to book them was bad enough but I always get so anxious when they're due: new person, heading to work which is a whole 'nother SA problem in itself, the waiting, what if they don't come? Should I sit at the back or front of the taxi, will there be an awkward silence for 15 minutes? etc.

Well, I had the same woman take me to work twice in a row, Saturday and Sunday. She was really nice and I actually talked to her. I can't even begin to describe what an achievement this is for me, seriously. I even asked her questions to what she was talking about. I'm still fucking buzzing and it's been a whole day.
And to top it off, she gave me the last taxi for free. She literally just said ""it's on the house :) "" I seriously couldn't believe it. I don't even know her and she obviously liked me enough to give me a taxi for free! Just the thought of someone 'liking' me even when they don't know me is a great feeling. Makes me feel like I shouldn't have to try and make people like me, because I didn't with her. I was just myself.

Next time I have her I'm definitely giving her a juicy tip, lol.

Just thought I'd share because I see a lot of negative posts on this sub-reddit and it needs cheering up! We should all focus on the things you did today that you were proud of, no matter how small. Even just a simple smile at a stranger. 

TL;DR: Talked with taxi driver without fear or awkwardness. Got last taxi free. Super happy.

**TL;DR - I had a big list of things to do today. BUT primarily I had a job interview today at the mall. I didn't want to go. I did. A guy approached me while walking we talked and swapped numbers. I went to the mall and filled out a job assessment questionnaire. After I was done I went to the grocery store all by myself, a rare event. My ""friend"" got home so I asked him to help with errands. I had to interact with some people and my ""friend made me feel horrible. Made fun of me hard core and made me cry. I didn't give up. I ended up successfully finishing the day by going into TWO other places and talking with managers in person.**

At a store that has a target market of self proclaimed fashionista girls aged 13-26. In this store - if I get the job I will be REQUIRED to wear 9 + pieces of clothing and accessories a day. I manged a solid 5 today. I'm fairly confident I'm not what these people are looking for. I'm not very fashionista... 

My social anxiety is really pushing hard for me not to leave the house today. I have to do it. For the moneys.

Just coming to my favorite sub reddit for my fellow SA sufferers support and suggestions. So ladies and gentleman any advice you could give me is valuable.

Even though I photographed with a potato. Nothing but [my face](http://i.imgur.com/Sw7xmY2.png) can describe my excitement right now

**UPDATE** Not sure if I got the job but some interesting things happened that I want to share. 

First off and most importantly: (all 7 of them) I got the balls gathered up to leave the house 

Second: I put on more makeup today than I have in two years. I also learned I have no idea how to apply makeup. BUT I must have done a damn good job for being so inexperienced. 

Third: While I was walking to the place my one of my worst fears manifested its self, a guy walking towards me on the side walk. I quickly got out my phone BUT he talked to me anyways. I did surprisingly well. It went something like:

Him ""Good morning""

Me ""G'moring""

Him ""You going to school?""

Me ""Nah.. actually a job interview""

Him ""Oh man no way! Me too! My is at ____ where is yours?""

Me ""_____ at the mall.""

Him ""Hey my name is _____ what is yours?

Me ""______""

Him ""Whats your phone number?""

Me ""________________""

Him ""Alright sweet. I'll call you and you text me how your interview goes okay ________?""

Me ""Sure. Good luck!""

Him ""You too""

and we parted ways. Plus side I didn't mess up my words. Down side - gave my number to a total stranger.

When I actually got to the mall and went in I messed up a little at first but I just gave my name and purpose and asked how they were and stuff... turned out all I had to do is sit on my ass and click on stuff on an ipod. It was a ""career assessment"" after 100 questions I just had to give it back and go. Pretty easy.

After I finished my interview I went to the grocery store..... by .... my.... self. :D and got tea. 

I am so damn proud of myself today ladies and gentlemen. This is the best day I've had socially in around 7 years.

**ANOTHER UPDATE**

So today was good. I did pretty much everything on my list of things to do.

~~Hope you get the job~~

~~Continue Applying Places~~

but after I got home from the mall I ran into some pretty intense problems. Again. and it made my day sad. Very sad. Crying was on my to do list anyway though. 

I got home from the mall and grocery store with my tea. My ""friend"" came home early from work about half an hour later. Since the Charter communication office and my bank were over three miles away I asked if he could drive me so that it would cut the time spent running me errands down. He agreed.

1st stop was the bank. I choose to go through the drive thru because... I didn't want to go inside because there were ALOT of cars in the parking lot. I got that taken care of and had plentiful moneys in my bank account. It was a pretty uneventful time. My ""friend"" just talked about how sick he felt and how he's probably going to go to a doctor soon. Good. 

2nd stop was charter communications. I had a modem I had to return and some fees I had to pay. This time I had to go into the building and talk to the lady. I went through it as best as I could. I told her I had some fees and equipment to return. I did stumble through a few words. We went through the process of bringing up my account. I returned the modem and gave her my debit card  I signed a few papers and stuff - everything went pretty much as expected. After it was all done I told her to have a good day she said ""you too"" and my ""friend"" and I left, that's when things started going *badly*

**""Wow... again. Watching you talk to people in so painfully awkward. You're like one of those fucking characters in movies that people feel embarrassed for. You really need to work on that FOR MY SAKE. Watching you talk to people makes me feel embarrassed""**

Boom

It went on from there but that was the worst of it for me.
From that point on I just stopped talking. He's since apologized a couple times but I don't buy it. I think it was the limit for me. I know I've confided in you guys about my struggles and how proud I was of myself today. I have to tell you I really appreciate everything you've said to encourage me and make me feel awesome but damn... one thing you hear from someone can really fuck things up emotionally. I've had toxic friendships in the past but this one really is starting to mess up my (once thought nonexistent) self esteem. At that point I just wanted to go home and sit in a corner. 

I thought of you guys though. So you'll be happy to know **I didn't give up.** I asked him to take me to two other places I had applied at to check in with the managers (in person) on how my applications were coming along. 

So at the end of the day. Screw my ""friend"", I realized he was mostly just saying what I thought in my head. I've decided he is the living embodiment of my self loathing and negativity. I now can kind of see the (very limited) good in having a ""friend"" that is so vile and negative. It made an otherwise internal struggle come to the outside and gave me enough motivation to at least try to be better than him to overcome my fears of judgement. I've come to realize that no matter how social he is or how much better he thinks he is than me. *People would probably like me more even though I would be shaking, scared, stumble over my words, awkward, and weird... because I would still try my best to be nice to them.* :/ he's stuck being a ""charismatic"" horrible unemphatic person forever and you can only coast on small talk and weak jokes for so long.

I've never been to this subreddit before, but I really wanted to share how proud I am of myself.

Two days ago: My boyfriend broke up with me. He fell out of love with me, which I was paranoid of happening from the beginning.

Yesterday: Still moderately hysterical. At 4pm I had to take the first part of my practical training test at my new job. I could only stop weeping for 30 seconds at a time before I began to drive there. *Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck*, my brain said, *You're going to be humiliated! Just turn around and abandon this new job. Just don't show up and go cry at home. They'll probably not let me keep the job if you're all weepy and emotional.*

I improved a bit by the time I got there, but god damnit, I got out of my car and went inside. 

I would tear up occaisionally, and a lot of people asked if I was sick. I told them the truth, ""I'm just upset. It's completely unrelated anything here."" And they expressed concern, not criticism.

Guys, I did awful during my practical test. I was mentally all over the place from the break up. Externally, only about 15% of my agitation showed. My trainer helped me, though. He gave me much more assistance than what he was supposed to. We didn't discuss my generally upset demeanor, but I'm sure he knew I was having a rough day. He only had sympathy for me, not cruel judgement.

A year ago, this would have played out differently. I would have figured out a way to leave. I would have used the misinterpetation that I was sick to gtfo. But most likely, I wouldn't have showed up at all.

I tend to get along better with the opposite sex -  females - because I feel like, as a male myself, there's a certain sort of male stereotype that I have to adhere to to be accepted by a group of males. 

I completely understand that there probably isn't really a stereotype and if I acted naturally, I'd probably be fine fitting into a social group of males quite nicely but my social anxiety causes me to be afraid of not being accepted, I guess and I make less of an attempt, whereas with females, I know there isn't a particular stereotype and so act naturally and are fine around them. 

I also know other people who could possibly be classed as socially anxious people who also get along better with the opposite sex, and although I haven't discussed it, that may be down to the same reason.

I just wondered whether it's actually a noticeable trait of social anxiety or if me and the other people I know are just exceptional examples?

The idea of everyone around becoming incredibly worried about me (which *will* happen, by the way) if I go to therapy just terrifies me. Telling them to leave me alone about the whole thing probably wouldn't do very much either, because my family can be very pushy. I can see them talking about it for weeks, or even months.

The more obvious problem of mine is that therapy actually requires you to go outside and interact with people. I haven't actually been outside in so long, and I feel as if I've forgotten how the world works, so I'll probably end up somehow making a fool of myself. Not to mention how obvious it is by my appearance that I don't go outside often enough, and we all know how judgemental people can be when it comes to how others look.

1375563280.0,50,self.socialanxiety,1jn7ns,Social Anxiety...Irrational fears of being judged. Advice anyone?,acescracked7,55,5,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1jn7ns/social_anxietyirrational_fears_of_being_judged/,"I'm a 20 year old, male, college student. I'm an introvert. I'm proud of that, I don't think there's anything wrong with being one, and I have no desire to change.

However, I also have social anxiety. And I think there's a difference between the two. It's starting to get worse now and I don't know how to deal with it.

Whenever l go to the mall with a friend, I get so much anxiety whenever I go into stores. I don't feel comfortable looking at clothes for myself, or trying anything on. I went into Sunglass Hut to look at some sunglasses, but I was too nervous to try anything on. And I hate when sales clerks bother and stalk me.

Most of this fear extends from the ""they're judging me"" mentality. I found that to be my issue. I'm not scared of people. I don't mind speaking with other people. Do I like to? No, not really. I usually avoid socializing with people I don't know or don't care to know. That's just the introverted side of me.

The social anxiety side is the irrational fear of judgement and rejection. I'm afraid people are going to think I look stupid trying certain things on. They're going to think I'm an idiot for even trying.

Also, the fact that I have applied for so many jobs and the only ones I've gotten hired for are office/phone customer service positions doesn't help. You know how that makes me feel? Shitty. Am I not 'attractive' enough for a customer-facing job? Am I too short? Fat? Ugly?

I never wear new clothes because I don't want people to notice the change, or bring attention to myself. I always wear jeans, t-shirt, and a hoodie or jacket. I would never feel comfortable wearing shorts, different colored jeans, flip flops or a button up shirt or anything. I feel vulnerable and exposed when I do. 

I applied for this healthcare internship at the hospital since I want to be an RN. The interview is in a month. But they offer a free workshop that gives you more information, helps with interview skills, and gives you preparation on the scenario-based questions they use during the interview.

This workshop was today.

Well, I drove all the way there and decided not to go to the workshop. I was getting a lot of anxiety and doubting myself. Basically, I was extremely vulnerable since I was wearing business attire (not my usual) and going to meet a bunch of people whom I've never seen. 

I saw a couple people walking to the building when I was driving buy. One was a guy around my age, and he looked so much more put together than me. He was up to date with the current style and everything, whereas I was just wearing plain black slacks, belt, shoes, and a nice shirt. 

People would have judged the living hell out of me. Thought I was weird. No one would have wanted to engage in conversation with me since I was the 'weird' one.

That was my logic. I know it's irrational. But I can't convince myself otherwise when I'm in the moment. 

I don't need acceptance. I don't fear rejection. I just want respect; no weird long stares or dirty looks people often give me. I'm just imagining it, but I feel that everyone I come across, whether it's a coworker, classmate, the girl at the cash register, etc...I feel that they form this opinion of me that I'm a creep and just weird as hell.

I am a little different. I'm only 5' 6"". Like I said, I'm quiet and mellow and speak softly but have a voice on the deeper side. I don't wear a false smile on my face, and my facial expression is not something I think about, so usually I'm expressionless. And making eye contact with an expressionless gesture is just creepy! 

I feel like I come across as 'that guy who would go somewhere and shoot up a bunch of people'. 

But I'm totally not. I'm a super 'soft' guy; I'm a really nice person if people actually gave me a chance.

On my drive home I was feeling so lost and upset knowing I have to remove myself from the applicant list for the interview since I won't be prepared for it now. I was thinking that I need to find a different career aspiration, because I obviously can't be an RN and have these fears. I do feel that if I could get over these issues, though, that I could be a good nurse. I genuinely care about people and love helping others.  

I smoke weed, and it does actually help with this. I feel a bit more confident in my abilities to engage in social situations and meet new people.

But I obviously can't be high all the time, haha. This is only good for social outings and stuff.

Anyways, if you read all this, thank you. I appreciate the help and advice. :)

If you are interested, go ahead and copy some down. Make them easier for yourself if you need to. (But not too easy!)

JUNE 

27th - Ask 10 people what time it is.

28th - Compliment 3 people.

29th - High-five 3 people.

30th - Ask someone if you can borrow $100 (Rejection Therapy)

JULY 

1st - Wear a suit. (Confidence)

2nd - BREAK

3rd - Ask 20 people for the time.

4th - Start a conversation with a stranger.

6th - High-five 6 people.

7th - Ask someone to borrow $100

8th - Wear a suit.

9th - BREAK

10th - Start a conversation with a stranger.

And that's it... for now.

Wish me luck! 

UPDATE:

June 27th - Only got to 7 people. Went to the mall and main street. This was really hard for me. 

June 28th - Complimented a really pretty girl at the mall about her boots. She said thanks and smiled. Adrenaline rush! Only got 1 person today but i'm not gonna let that get me down!

June 29th - The weather was terrible today so I couldn't do it. Just kidding, I'm just making an excuse. I pussied out. Tomorrow!

June 30th - 5 high fives!!! One person kind of made fun of me after the high five... I think that's why Im so afraid of people. I only got 2 rejections. They were pretty harsh. Me: ""High five!"" Stranger: ಠ_ಠ ""No!"" I also tried to high five a 50-something year old dad with his wife and kids. He did it. This one is pretty fun, guys. 

BONUS: Last night (June 30th), my friend and I were taking a random drive at 3 am. We stopped at a beach. I saw a girl walking by and I approached her and introduced myself. She liked us and then I asked her if she wanted to join us on our adventure. She did! It was awesome and I made a new friend.

July 1st - Wore a suit, complimented a girl on her shirt and gave a couple strangers a high five. It's becoming a habit!

July 2nd - I know today is my break, but I got bored. I said hello to two girls on bikes, a guy asked me where to get the best ice cream, i let him know where to go, and i told a girl that i liked her shirt. She completely ignored me and i heard a laugh. Oh well. I know a lot of guys who wouldn't have the balls to say that. Not sure why it's funny...

July 3rd - I GOT 20 PEOPLE! It was awkward because some people saw me ask multiple people for the time.. But fuck it. This time around was a little easier. I also complimented a girl on her boots and she just ignored me. Why can't a girl take a compliment?

July 4th - Tried to start a conversation with a guy that was preparing to set off fireworks. He didn't seem like he wanted to talk. I felt like I was being annoying, Also tried to start a conversation with a girl at a register. Didn't seem like she wanted to talk either... Oh well.

July 5th - Got drunk and walked down Main Street. First guy i asked for a high-five, he stops and goes ""NO! ...I WANT A HUG!"" So i gave him a hug. I got rejected by someone and he insulted me. I was drunk so I insulted him back. Got a nice amount of high fives and approached 4 foreign guys riding bikes and asked where they were from.

Sometimes it was the other persons fault, like when I moved in with a close friend who turned out to have no respect for other peoples money or time or even animals. I'm not confrontational at all, so I just let these friendships go and I think the feelings were mutual. Sometimes it's just an ex I would really, really not want to run into. Does anybody else kind of.. get stressed out about the people you really don't want to bump into? What do you do when one of those people suddenly sit down across from you on the bus?

I've been really down lately and I need a pat on the back...I can't go to my few friends about it mainly because they can't relate. 

I find socializing to be a huge drag. I actually love being in peoples' company, but I find the whole building relationships bit boring and exhausting. I am what you would probably label as a sociable introvert. I also feel like I'm usually doing 100% of the work, even if there seems to be a natural likeness or attraction (if dating). I have to message/call them, I have to ask them to do things, I have to start the conversations...and when I am dating, I have to flirt and make the moves. Maybe I am just attracted to equally shy people? Eitherway, this leads me to feeling apathetic about it and not wanting to bother. Furthermore, nothing really feels like it comes intuitively to me when I socialize. For example, I went on a date with a girl, it went well and we both seemed to click...now I have NO idea what to do. There is no gut response, no emotions telling me which way to go, no ideas - I just feel apathy. 

I find if difficult to relate to people, and over the past couple years - even though my SA has gotten better - I feel like I've just plainly lost interest in people...therefore, no interest in meeting new people. I used to be excited to see what a different person's perspective is and what they have to say, but it seems people are just not extraordinary...I feel like we're all just animals filling our needs and keeping ourselves busy. Sometimes I feel like my perspective is so far off from the average person that when I walk in the streets, I feel like I am a different species from the people around me. I feel pretty alienated because of who I really am. I seem to only get by socially when I hide my depressive personality. I am happy in my own company, but I still get very lonely.

This is bothering me because I just moved to a new city, and I don't have a job yet, I don't go to school, and so I have no segregated way of easily building some acquaintances and real friends. I've tried meeting up with people and going to events, volunteering, ect. but everything is very hit and miss. All my friends from other places are excited for me, but I'm feeling very 'meh, it's just like anywhere else'. I'm getting pretty depressed and I find myself withdrawing more everyday just because I have no one to talk with or do things with. I am always just alone and meeting people is such a struggle, I just don't feel like I care at all anymore. I've actually felt like this for most of my life about socializing. I find the older I get, the less I'm willing to try and the more I feel like my perspective is affirmed by my experiences.

I got put on effexor, which did help somewhat. It also eventually made me such an insomniac that I *had* to switch, and went on wellbutrin. That definitely started helping, much more than the effexor. After hurricane Irene, when I ended up having to deal with a flooded basement while my husband was in Europe, along with finding out I was developing osteoarthritis before age 40, I got so stressed that my doc gave me a little as-needed Ativan, which I've ended up taking maybe once or twice a week.

Somehow, after all this, I just found the guts to sign up for a vendor table at a craft bazaar at a local high school, and although I'm nervous, I'm actually excited too. It's such a big show that they typically get upwards of 2k visitors. (I'm trying to only think about that in terms of how many sales it could mean.)

I have a little under two months... wish me luck! This will be a hell of a leap forward for me if I pull it off. I doubt I could do it if I didn't have my husband's support, and while he was shocked when I announced I wanted to do this, he's been very supportive.

So before any major social situation I kind of freeze up. I don't talk to anybody all day, am nervous all the time, stay hidden till the event, and all in all just retreat from the world (much more than I already have). 

But what I have found that works really well is if I talk to someone else that scares me before the actual event that terrifies me. That way you warm up, your adrenaline starts going, you get out of your head a little bit, it becomes just another social interaction. Going from no interaction all day, to being at a party with tons of people is like going from 0 to 100 in a second. You are gonna fuck up your engine.

For example: I had a phone interview that I was super nervous about. I didn't talk to anybody all day. I was freaking out and just waiting for the time to pass and get the whole thing over with. The actual interview went terribly. I didn't feel like myself when I was talking, I made no sense while I was talking and the whole thing was awful. I felt like just hanging up and never speaking to anyone ever again. The lady even asked if I was nervous and told me that I shouldn't be. I must have sounded awful. For whatever reason, they called me in for an in-person interview. I then decided to handle the whole situation a little differently. I texted a friend of mine the night before and told him I was gonna call the next day at 10 am and we were gonna talk for a couple of minutes. He didn't really understand what was going on but he's a good guy so he went along with it. I was now nervous that I had to call my friend at 10, and it took my mind off of the interview a little bit. I called him the next day, I explained to him what was going on, he gave me some tips and then I hung up. It was short and sweet and afterwards I was still nervous about the interview, but it had become just another social interaction for me. My heart rate was up, I got out of my head a bit and was more in the moment, I had gotten warmed up. At the interview, I was still nervous but I thought I did much better. I felt much better and I didn't feel like dying during or afterwards. Even though the lady still told me that I was being nervous, I had felt much better throughout the whole interaction so that is a win in my book.

So if you have a party or something, maybe go to a grocery store and ask for where they keep their gum. You get your initial social interaction out of the way and you get some gum! Or if you have someone to call. Call someone you know, someone that makes you a bit nervous, and then make the actual call. It becomes another interaction instead of something you have been thinking about all day.",,False,,t5_2r22n,1359744602.0,,,True,t3_17pgiv,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/17pgiv/protip_dont_go_into_a_social_situation_cold/,

&gt;Shoma Morita (1874-1938) was a Japanese psychiatrist who worked with socially anxious people. He was of another time, another culture. Sometimes, we are blind to different ways of looking at things because we are so steeped in our own time and culture. What is appealing about Morita's approach is his positive take on the meaning of social anxiety. This meaning is contained within the three fundamental, philosophical premises underlying Morita therapy. According to Ishu Ishiyama, associate professor at The University of British Columbia, they are

&gt; - social anxiety, including shyness, is a normal human emotion
- social anxiety has a self-actualizing meaning
- social anxiety can be used as a motivator-facilitator, rather than as an inhibitor, of constructive action

&gt;Let's examine these three points more closely. First, social anxiety and shyness are normal. We've already seen in Chapter 1 that only seven to eleven percent of the population reported that they have never felt shy. Morita pointed out that normal shyness is not a problem. People get themselves into trouble when they become *shy about being shy*. This second level of shyness brings with it unnecessary pain - the pain associated with a sense of not belonging, of being flawed.

&gt;The second premise underlying Morita's therapy is that social anxiety has a self-actualizing meaning. In Chapter 1, we learned that the usual definition of social anxiety relates to fear of social failure. What this definition lacks is the opposite side of the coin. If we fear social failure, then we must wish for social success. In other words, social anxiety really means that we want to do well. Reframing social anxiety in this positive way can have a liberating effect.

&gt;For instance, when my youngest son, Jordan, was six years old and just learning to play baseball, he once took me aside during a break in a Little League game. With an air of concern, he said, ""Mommy, when I go up to bat, my arm starts to shake and shake."" He looked at me searchingly, as if waiting for a response that would solve this mysterious phenomenon. Had I not known about Morita's ideas, I'm sure I would have slipped into the usual explanation that might have sounded like, ""Well, sweetheart, that's because you're a little nervous, you know, a little shy in front of all those people. Don't worry about it; you'll do okay."" I would have felt that I was being supportive. Chances are, however, that these words would have offered little but cold comfort. Chances also are that Jordan would have identified with being nervous and shy and would have worried about whether he could stop worrying. Instead, I told Jordan, ""Of course, honey, that's because you want to do well!"" His response? An enthusiastic, ""Yeah, Mom, I want to do well!"" and off he scampered to join his buddies.

&gt;When we see social anxiety as an expression of our desire to do well in a social setting, social anxiety is transformed into something honorable. Isn't wanting to do well, after all, an honorable goal? This brings us to the third premise. Social anxiety can be used as a motivator, a facilitator, rather than as an inhibitor of constructive action. If social anxiety can remind us that we are simply human beings wanting to coexist with other human beings in a meaningful and successful way, it can motivate us to stay focused on constructive action. It becomes a green light, telling us to go ahead with whatever task lies ahead, whether it is talking to people, making a toast, or asking someone to dance.

&gt;For many, Morita's ideas are liberating. Once the focus is on constructive action, people will notice that any inconvenient anxious feelings that do come up soon run their course and give way to the excitement of achieving a goal. One achievement spurs another. Confidence builds and the way is paved for continued involvement in a variety of social settings.

&gt;Granted, people who experience extreme social anxiety may argue that maintaining this positive focus is a lot easier said than done. Of course, this argument has some weight, especially if focusing on negative symptoms and thoughts has become an entrenched habit. In this case, the Morita approach may not be enough. Finding other ways of shrinking the shyness habit will be critical. The approaches described in the rest of the book will provide useful alternatives.",,False,,t5_2r22n,False,,,True,t3_rzj1r,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/rzj1r/social_anxiety_means_you_want_to_do_well/,
1328398602.0,45,self.socialanxiety,pb6qp,My experience and advice in helping to overcome social anxiety.,Jayaa11,46,1,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/pb6qp/my_experience_and_advice_in_helping_to_overcome/,"I wanted to share with you my experience of social anxiety, some techniques from a psychologist that have helped and also some of my own advise in helping to overcome it. I have improved quite a lot although it is still noticeable. It will take time and probably won't be diminished completely. I can accept that though. As long as I can function reasonably normally.
   
Cognitive behavioural therapy did help me. I think it would have been even more effective if I had stayed with the psychologist for the correct amount of time. I realise now that it helped me more than what I thought it did back then in 2010. The reason for this: mostly in life, the more knowledge you have the easier it is for you to deal with the problems that get in your way. 

Some of the techniques the psychologist used were; Getting me to think record and think logically about the automatic negative thoughts (ANTs) I had in a social situation. Of course most of them made not much sense. By analysing the (ANTs) when socialising I could block them out. As you do this more, it gets better. 

Another technique was exposure to social situations. The psychologist would take me into town so I could talk to the public. He started me off with easier situations, then gradually changed them to more uncomfortable ones. I was nervous to start with, but after each conversation I became more relaxed. 

After this I was to have conversations, consisting of purposeful mistakes that my mind was scared I'd make. One of these; being unable to say something fast enough, So, I had to take a long pause after a word before continuing my sentence. By observing how menial the reactions of people I was conversing with were, I once again became less nervous. 

The repetition of these techniques and others, is strengthening a neural pathway in the mind that will allow you to have less anxiety in a social situation. 

When socialising the anxiety would cloud my mind, essentially destroying any kind of conversation, as I could not think of any more words to say. By meditating and not worrying if I did make a mistake I was able to function better. 

Another discovery I made was, by learning and analysing life and other people, you realise that the worries that Social Anxiety embeds in your mind are so trivial. We are only human and all humans have defects. Anyone that judges and reacts to you negatively also has defects and should not be as arrogant to do such a thing. However, arrogance and all negativity in the world is caused by the lack of knowledge, which brings me to another point. 

If you can accept that you have social anxiety and know what causes it, you can explain this to others. They can hopefully then understand that your unusual social interactions are not to be associated with your ego, but to a unwanted self appointed representative named social anxiety. They can then relate and empathise with you.

I live with my brother and his girlfriend. We all go to the same college (they are just a tad older than I am).  They decided to throw a small party for 4th of July.  All of my friends were out of town for break or went home so I had no one coming. 

At first, I thought I would be fine.  Chat with them a bit, drink to relax,  maybe make some friends.  Didn't work out too great.  The second I was introduced, I was introduced as ""the little sister"".  The second my brother said those words, a little voice popped into my head that told me that none of them like me, they all though of me as a little kid crashing their party, etc.

I generally feel out of place with my brother and his friends.  While we are both nerdy and geeky, its cool for him to be like that.  I am the chubby little sister with glasses trying to fit in.  Today it was worse.  They are all so attractive. They are all so well-adjusted.

I tried to make it, but I couldn't.  I felt like their was this huge build up in my chest, I forgot what to do with my hands, and I couldn't handle it anymore.  I ran to my room and decided to stay in here for the night.

My brother's girlfriend is sweet and she decided to try and convince me to join the rest of the group.  I rejoined them once, but that made the feelings worse.  Now, the voice in my head was telling me that they all thought I was crazy and weird (and who could blame them, I was acting crazy and weird).  

So I am hiding in my room now, and I can hear them talking outside.  My window was open and is facing the yard and I can hear them talking ABOUT ME.  When I usually go to my room, I sit and tell myself that everything is in my head but now I can HEAR THEM SAYING I'M WEIRD AND CRAZY.  I can't close the window, or they'll know I was listening.

And the pain. The pain in my chest.  The crushing anxiety that goes away once I get to my room and lock the door is there and getting stronger.  I can't get rid of it.   I don't know what to do.

We wound up sitting at an outdoor table off of Broadway and talking and catching up.  It was a simple but terrific, terrific experience for me.  I don't envision a future with this girl and I am not crushing on her or anything like that.  But she's interesting and attractive and it does me a world of good to hang out with a member of the opposite sex.

I started shaking and bowling terribly because of the shaking. I ended up with a 39, so you know. Anywho, the game was coming to an end and I was putting my shoes on and I decided I should just tell him that his shirt was rad. 

So I stood up and just kind of quietly said, ""Hey,"" but he didn't notice. His dad did though, and got his attention for me. The exchange kind of went like this (I can't remember the exact words):

Me: Hey, I like your shirt. I actually got to see them in April.

Him: Thanks.. really? That's so cool!

Me: Yeah..

Him: Yeah, I actually had the opportunity to see them earlier, but something came up..

I know what it feels like to be afraid to even leave the house, I was there. Please don't attack me for bringing up a method for talking to people! 


Okay, so the method is called FORD, and it's extremely simple. I don't know about you, but when I meet people, a lot of the time I just used to freeze, lock up and forget stuff I wanted to even talk about. This should make that easier, because you need only remember four letters! 

F - Family
O - Occupation
R - Recreation 
D - Dreams


When you meet people, remember FORD and you should be able to engage in amazing conversations after a while. The family part you may find yourself skipping sometimes, that's perfectly fine. Like I said, this opened my eyes and helped me immensely, because this is SO SIMPLE and almost impossible to forget!

I've got mild social anxiety so I can live with it, it doesn't interfere too much with my life and I'm trying to improve but there is something that really bothers me because it's really painful and hard to manage : flashbacks. 
I'm pretty sure many of you have felt this feeling where you relive over and over again some insignificant social act or event or some words you said and you feel so bad about it. It's like PTSD every time after seeing people. (Less frequent with friends)
Those flashbacks strike without a warning and it interferes with the rewarding feeling of overcoming the fear of social interraction. They get less frequent and disappear with time but others will come with the next social interraction.

Because of drug problems and having no job for a long time, I didn't really leave the house for years, what made the whole thing as bad as you can't imagine.

6 months ago I got a job. The first time was so hard, made so much dumb stuff that still makes me cringe when I think about it. Even though most co-workers probably see me as a weirdo, I think I can be proud of myself for getting through this. I'm so much better now with talking with people and so on (embrassing stuff still happens on a daily basis but I can somehow live with that).

But now I made a mistake. A BIG MISTAKE. My boss is a fearsome man. Not just for people with social anxiety but for almost everyone. 
Yesterday he send me to the post office to send a package for him. There were some details I didn't understand and he was already gone when I wanted to aks him about it. So I just did it the way I thought it would be right. Afterwards I realized it was probably wrong (but still not quite sure). That made me so nervous that I didn't sleep last night. I  somehow got through the day without giving him the bill from yesterday. Then he asked me to do the same thing again today.

Well....I already did it yesterday, so I couldn't just ask him today how I should do it. So I did it again...and now I'm more than sure that it was wrong. This mistake costs money. Not a fortune but still enough to be pretty angry about it.

I don't even got a problem to pay that. Not even a little bit. The confrontion is the thing I fear so much I just want to die :( I'm so scared.

Not just that he will stump me in the ground, he will stump me in the ground in frot of all my co-workers. The shame will be unbearable. Everyone will think I'm dumb....or at least - now be sure about it.

I don't know how I can go to work tomorrow. I can't do this. 

Theres a slight chance he will not notice it tomorrow. But if not, he will notice it when the package comes back. I could even think of myself confessing if it would be just that one time...but it was twice ;(

I really don't know what to do right now. Funny thing is, a few days ago I thought about posting something about ""It gets better with time""...well it gets better...but then it just gets worse then ever.....HELP!

Using a throwaway just because people in my life know don't know about who I used to be.

Basically for the first 23 years of my life, I was pretty much a gamer. I didn't really have friends and spent a lot of time inside. I used to get nervous all the time I had to speak in front of a class or do group projects. In college I always sat in the back of the room where nobody would talk to me, and I even dropped my Public Speaking class 3 times.  I had to take this class to graduate, and I ended up with a teacher who I spoke with (pretty much had to talk to him) and he suggested doing therapy. I went to my schools counselor after realizing that I can't live like this for the rest of my life. I was on the road to living a long (or possibly short) lonely life. I went to counseling and instead of spending my time playing World of Warcraft, I spent my time trying to understand my social anxiety. 

 I eventually made the connection to myself that I was being so irrational. I was able to talk to my guild on World of Warcraft just fine, but face to face I was scared and nervous all the time. Thinking that I was always being judged or people think I am dumb or stupid or ugly. I eventually I was reading motivational quotes every day, realizing that my life is in my hands and I have to do something about it if I don't want to live the rest of my life like this. Eventually I got a job because of my parents, and my parents threatened to cut me off if I quit, so I basically had to keep the job. I eventually had to talk to people face to face, and I realized it was easier for me to do it as part of my job, than just my own free will. Eventually over time I realized I couldn't even remember people from 20 minutes ago, and I made that connection to my irrational fears of speaking to people. 

Now I have improved a lot and I think I am somewhat cured from my social anxiety. I still get nervous when I try new things but I always try to think of the worst that can happen, and usually it doesnt happen, so I have conditioned myself to realize that things aren't going to be as bad as I think they are. I've made some friends at work, and they invite me to do things that I would have never done before, and honestly I only go just because I know I needed to break out of my SA, and I come to realize after constantly forcing myself to go out and face my fears, that its all in my head and as I get used to the interactions and being sick to my stomach, I realized its not that bad and nobody is going to remember me tomorrow, so it helped ease my mind even more.

Now I am 25 and I am much happier with my life. Given I get depressed about how much better I could have been if it weren't for my SA, but I am happy I have managed to go through hell, and keep going, and now I have a few people I would consider a real friend (not just online), and a stable job. I even go out sometimes just to do it because that feel I get when I am out in public, with people looking at me, and just realizing how far I have come. I basically faked it until I made it (Amy Cuddy Ted Talk helped me so much!).

I will try to keep checking in on this and leaving advice and answering questions the best I can. I will leave this quote for you guys, it really helped motivate me to change myself.

This post will be long, but I hope it'll be useful. I wanted to write something about social anxiety to try and help others and give something back, but I'm a bit too spineless to do it publicly (yet) - I'm actually a freelance writer, and feel it'd be a bit damaging for editors to know about my anxiety (if it's not already obvious!) Although for the record, everyone I've told has been wonderfully supportive, so that may be all in the mind. Given the nature of the condition, that'd be wholly unsurprising.

So, some notes before I begin:

1) I'm on the mild end of social anxiety, and I'm one of those types who seems to get by okay. A friend of mine with depression once described herself as 'like a high functioning alcoholic' as in she can hold it together for the most part in public. That's probably true of me: I have a good job, go out in public, I don't avoid functions I feel I have to go to, and if pressured into doing scary social things I will (with mixed success), but I have an avoidant streak I'm forcing myself to counter. More on that later.

2) I'm based in the UK, so my therapy was free on the NHS. I'm massively grateful to the NHS for covering this, which is one of the reasons I wanted to write something up, so at least some of the professional help I received free of charge can be passed on to others who can't afford the help.

3) I have never been serious enough to qualify for medication, so I can't talk about their effectiveness or otherwise. I did try some over the counter stuff once (HTP-5), when I had to go to a networking event where I knew nobody, and it relaxed me a little: no idea if it was the placebo effect though!

- Discovering the condition:

I went up until the age of 25 without knowing SA existed. I assumed it was just a character quirk unique to me that I would clam up, avoid situations and run through a post-mortem in my head after every (imagined or real) social disaster. Then one day while waiting for my bus home from the office after a particularly troubling event, I was idly googling on my phone and discovered a full list of symptoms, ticking them off one by one. Both inspiring and terrifying to learn that A) I wasn't alone and B) I had a mental illness.

I sat on that information for a little while. Then I went to a hypnotherapist, where I had three sessions. Weird experience, very relaxing, and possibly helpful in the short run, but it was expensive and I didn't see a dramatic change so let it drop.

After breaking up with my girlfriend of 7 years, I realised that being newly single, there wasn't a better time to get this checked. So I went to my GP… I had been once before to a different surgery, but the weird thing is that because my SA is triggered by certain situations, I was outgoing and chatty with the doctor, and I don't think I was believed: fobbed off with a few internet links. This time I was determined, but I didn't register high enough on their charts, so they said I could self refer to a mental health specialist. Which I did, and now I have an NHS therapist.

- The basic model

So here's the current psychological understanding of how SA works for those that don't know. It's essentially a vicious cycle that gets worse the longer its allowed to progress unchecked.

Dreading social interactions ---&gt; Nerves ---&gt; Perceived poor social performance/physical anxiety symptoms ---&gt; Negative thoughts about self ---&gt; Avoiding social interactions

That's actually a simplified diagram, because of the limits of text. This is the actual model: http://www.brainhe.com/students/types/images/clip_image004.gif

But the results are the same. That goes round and round in a circle, each time reinforcing itself meaning it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, and that bit harder to break. CBT works by breaking these at the weakest point to gradually make it less and less of a problem. 

- Recommended Reading:

My therapist began by printing off some sheets to read through from 'Overcoming Social Anxiety and Shyness by Gillian Butler. I was impressed enough to buy the whole thing, which is available as a kindle download so people won't know what you're reading: http://www.amazon.co.uk/Overcoming-Social-Anxiety-Shyness-Gillian/dp/1849010005

(Just to be clear: I'm not affiliated with the author at all, it's just the handout my therapist worked with - so that's good enough for me. Good place to start anyway.)

That's the psychological stuff out of the way, from here on in, it's just stuff from my own experience. Your mileage will probably vary (there's a lot of stuff in the book/sessions that doesn't apply to me: it's a broad condition!)

- Avoidance

You can always make excuses for not doing something that makes you anxious - including not getting professional help. Be super critical of every decision you make. Are you doing it because you genuinely can't, or are you making excuses? Avoidance is a fairly big part of the vicious cycle, because it prevents opportunities to see that things weren't as bad as you imagined (and reinforces the belief that you had to do it, because it would have been a disaster if you hadn't avoided). In short, it's a safety behaviour that offers short term relief, but makes things worse in the long run.

- Mind Reading

I've always thought of myself as quite perceptive, and have an uncanny ability to figure out if I like someone within minutes of meeting them (I'm good at picking out bastards). The trouble is that SA people think they're a bit too good at this, and choose to interpret reactions in the worst possible light. Take an example where you meet someone you haven't seen in a while, and you note a 'negative expression' for a second before smiling and chatting. Is that because they don't like you, or have noticed something about you, or because you took them by surprise? Look for evidence to back up your negative view - if there's none there, your SA is taking over. You can't know what's going on in their head.

This also applies to the 'post mortem' we all do on negative experiences: just because we obsess about every little reaction and event, doesn't mean everyone else does. In fact, in most cases they won't even remember because people are pretty self-absorbed. If they noticed at all, it won't stick with them in the long run. I don't remember the exact quote but it seems pertinent here: ""You can't compare yourselves to others, when you only see their 'best of' moments, and yourself at your best and worse"". Sure it was more catchy than that, but you get this idea.

- Observing Progress

It's in our natures to be hypercritical of ourselves - more so than we would ever be of other people. Setbacks happen, but it's important not to dwell upon them. Counter to this, it's also easy to overlook improvements and dwell on the failures. I've come a pleasing way over the course of my therapy and over the last few years in general: I used to be terrified of answering phones, but do that all the time now, for example.

Everyone is anxious sometimes: the purpose of improving SA is to make it manageable to live with. Any improvement is a cause for celebration, so don't be too hard on yourself.

For example, I want to go to a coffee shop and make small talk with the cashier and waiting customers. Instead, I tell myself that I should go to the gym and practice guitar instead (which I end up doing), because I want to be healthy and I want to be a good musician. This happens all the time when I'm out at night, too. If I see a good looking girl, there's always the typical thoughts of ""what if she rejects me/laughs at me/has a boyfriend/etc"", but the *most detrimental* thought  of mine by far is the ""Oh don't worry about her, man. There's tons of other fish in the sea. Next night you go out, *then* you talk to girls.""

It's like my anxiety is pretending to be my friend. It pretends to care for me. It's always thinking I should go to the gym, get plenty of rest, read more books, etc, rather than do exposure exercises. 

I wouldn't call it procrastination, per say. Maybe it's anxiety-induced procrastination. I've been able to overcome procrastination at times in my life, however, this voice in my head I've never been able to break free of. Advice?

In the mean time, I have to get this off of my chest to people who understand. This is therapy to me and I'd like to thank anyone who is willing to read this. You're awesome and very kind.

I am incredibly uncomfortable saying hello to people I am unfamiliar with or people who have closed off body language. It's irrational, I know, but if I get a don't get a positive response, a nice hello back or friendly something, I get discouraged and feel reluctant being friendly.

This happened recently. I've been at my current job for a year and one girl, who seems really chipper and out going, thinks I'm a rude jerk for not saying hello when ever I see her. This made me mad and sad like I really am a jerk or just too feeble minded to get a grip on my SA that this happened. I'm not ignoring her intentionally. I just feel awkward and dumb around her.

I've tried being friendly in the past, I've said hi or good morning only to get a curt response back, as though I am bothering her. It's happened a few times so I stopped trying and resorted back to being quiet and out of her way. Now when I do see her, I smile but I usually look away or occupy myself with a task. 

In my defense, I never ignore someone who makes an effort to greet me. I always try to give a happy greeting back when it's initiated. However, I don't remember the last time she's ever said hello to me which makes me feel like she's a hypocrite. If this is so disturbing to her why can't she say hello to me? This is why I'm angry. Also, I hate when people think I'm being mean by being quiet. I'm not trying to be. I'm just feel comfortable like this.

Then I get sad because I know I don't interact socially in a normal way. I feel stupid. I feel weak and I feel inadequate. I don't know what to do now. I feel angry at her for being critical of me, yet I feel I should do something to change this. I feel even more uncomfortable now then I did before and I just wish my quietness wasn't a big deal.

As I got older my small circle of friends I did have were all disappearing one by one either from moving away or getting married and I became pretty introverted.

Then last summer I tried to change that by joining meetup.com and some meetup groups.  Most of the ones I went to were tough because of my SA and I'd go once, not really meet anyone and not go again.  Then I joined a SA support group called Social Anxiety Busters of Orange County CA and it was really great.  Everyone was super friendly and non-judging and it was just a totally cool and comfortable atmosphere.  Everyone understands that everyone has issues and so nobody puts anyone on the spot or interrogates them or questions why they're so quiet.  Instead they just have informative monthly SA workshops, and then a bunch of fun outgoing activities constantly like hikes, board game nights, movie nights, picnics, bar hopping, etc... and by continually going out doing stuff with people I was comfortable around I found over about 6 months it really helped my SA and I started joining other groups and meeting lots of people and making more friends.  I went from having like 5-10 people I could actually call up on a weekend to do something with to having 30+; also made some really close friends when I'd been down to almost no close friends.  So yeah, in my situation it helped a lot and it sounds cheesy but it changed my life.  

Anyhow, because it helped me so much I started helping out a lot with setting up events in the group and became one of the event organizers.  Last fall the organizers got together and had an idea of bringing this safe comfortable experience to more people by doing a weekend retreat for all of California, or at least Southern CA.  Things moved along and eventually a non-profit corporation was setup to create S.A.F.E. A Social Anxiety Forum Experience in Big Bear California over the weekend of June 7-9th, 2013 and open it up to anyone with SA, or introversion, or shyness, or who just want to work on their social skills.

We rented out two entire hostels and it's gonna be like a giant camp getaway, except with a group of people from all over who are chill, friendly, and won't put you on the spot or judge you.  There will be activities like fishing, sailing, hiking, board games, treasure hunts, bar hoppings, volleyball, golf on Sat/Sun and workshops and guest speakers in-between for more a direct approach on understanding and working with SA.  Dinners and Breakfasts will be provided and at lunch groups will go to town and eat.  The price on the website for the whole thing (including room &amp; meals outside lunch) is $150, though we're trying to get it down to $120 right now, so might want to wait a few days; though we'll refund anyone who pays at $150 if the price lowers.

I apologize for how last minute this is compared to other conventions and retreats that have info up 6 months in advance and this thing is in just a month away, but if you live in So CA and think this would be something you'd enjoy, please take a look!

You may be considered an ""underachiever,"" when in reality it's your fears holding you back, not your ability or motivation.

&gt;Hypersensitivity to criticism

&gt;Poor social skills

&gt;Isolation and difficult social relationships

&gt;Substance abuse

Here's the deal: I feel like chatting with someone, but I'm not specifically looking for new friends. (Otherwise I'd post to /r/needafriend.) I like meeting people and I like helping people, and if I can help someone have a pleasant social interaction, I'd love to help! 

I wouldn't say I have social anxiety, really... I'm kind of like a friendly introvert. I might overthink social interactions and act kind of awkward, but overall, I'm pretty comfortable with myself. (Although, I often get anxious about anything regarding financial transactions and am averse to leaving the house.)

I'm subscribed to this subreddit because I have an interest in all sorts of things related to interpersonal relationships. I've also found that a lot of people who are social anxious tend to be really cool, for several reasons. Like, for one, many of you are very sensitive and thoughtful. I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like you kinda have to be in order to have all sorts of thoughts related to wondering how others perceive you, etc. 

Now regarding the chat. Ideally, I'd like to Skype call and/or webcam, but typing is fine, too. I figure this kind of ""one-time-offer"" might take off the pressure because it's not a ""friend interview"". Let's just have fun. We can be goofy. I'll put my shoe on my head if it makes you feel more comfortable.

But not the cyber kind of fun, okay? I'm a 24/f who is married. (I figure being married is also cool because nobody has to worry about trying to or trying not to hit on me. We can make jokes, but it'll be understood that this is platonic and we're not trying to impress each other.)

Sorry for the text wall. And, uh, am I coming off as sounding weird or snobbish? *shrug* You can let me know. I'm actually really nice! (Maybe not humble. *sigh*)

Anyway, just add me over Skype and message me whenever. If I'm not on or if I'm busy, I'll write as soon as possible, okay? My handle: domestic_titty_kitty

**Edit:** It's been about an hour. To my dismay, nobody has written yet or even added me over Skype. Not that I was expecting an overwhelming response or anything. That's the nature of it, right?

But here's something that I think is interesting that I'd like to share. When it comes to friendship and general socialization, it's like I almost have firstworldproblems-SA. That is, I put myself out there beyond what most people do, so understandably I can feel a bit nervous. I admit, I've been feeling anxious! Waiting, hoping someone will respond. I've reached out. Despite the handful of upvotes, no one has answered. It feels like rejection. It feels bad. I wonder if there was something I should have or should have not said.

And though so far I am disappointed, I am really proud that I tried this. It's something I've been wanting to try for months now. I feel awkward, but I'm glad I tried. I'm also keeping in mind that there are all sorts of reasons people might not reply that have nothing to do with me.

* Too shy or anxious. (Obviously!)
* Busy.
* Don't want to install Skype.
* Didn't see the post.

So, while I can experience some anxiety, I also feel pride and joy. And, for me, that makes it worth it.

**I'm still around. And I'm still hoping. Please don't be shy. (But if you are, that's okay, too. I'll be fine!)**

I tried to do my best and be confident. When high school came around things got even tougher for me. Everyday it was like I'd go to sleep and hope I'd wake up and things would be different. Ever time I started a new school year I told myself that things would be different this time, that I'd change, but I never did. 

And now I'm 21 and realizing, maybe I've been putting way too much blame on myself here. I mean think about it, most of us are afflicted with this crippling disorder. Hell it's almost like going through life handicapped. Then you have people telling you ""stop being so shy"", ""get over your fears"", ""stop worrying what others think"". We've been led to believe that this entirely our fault, as if we chose to do this to ourselves.

I don't know about you, but I feel like my life is significantly harder with this problem and I don't like it when people belittle my struggle just because they've never been where I am. And for me, I feel like I set the bar too high for myself. When I can't reach it, I get hopeless and depressed.

I realized what I need to start doing is to just start being positive about every little step I take. Something as simple as saying hi to a complete stranger. Someone might say that it's no big deal and they do that everyday, well good for them, but they aren't me. 

You see I don't think I give myself enough credit for the stuff I do. I always say to myself, ""that's nothing, you are being irrational for fearing something that normal people do all the time"". When I should be saying, ""good for you, I know how hard that was but you were able to push past the fear and do it"".

To put it simply, I think maybe some of us spend too much time on focusing on how we aren't quite there yet or comparing ourselves to individuals who don't suffer from this problem. And that's just gonna lead to a lot of dissapointment because we have to go at our own pace. Yeah it's unfair how some people don't deal with this, but the fact is we have to start congratulating ourselves for every little thing we do and build up that confidence. 

Just remember you aren't weak. You are strong. Because the amount of shit we have to deal with would make any individual struggle. So give yourself a pat on the back for any small or large achievements you've made throughout your life. It's especially important to remember this on the darker days. Because even when they come around and you are depressed, that doesn't make you weak either. It's tough and sometimes it becomes more than you can handle. That's alright. You're only human.

I ate my chips and was using the internet, reading, watching TV in my room.  I was doing great.  Then my tummy started rumbling.  I had assumed that they would all leave when they woke up but they decided to make their party last another day.  

I couldn't go out there, I had gone to high school with some of these guys and they had a tendency to pick on me.  Playfully, but it gets to me.  So I stayed in my room hungry, and assumed that they would eventually leave.

But first, a short back story.

Growing up, I had a full on phobia of public speaking. After quitting my college speech class on the second day, I started spiraling into anxiety and negative thoughts about how I was going to have to quit college (because there was no way in hell I could speak in front of a group of people). I made a do-or-die decision one day that I would throw myself toward the fear.

I discovered an organization called ""Toastmasters,"" and went to my first meeting. Toastmasters is a huge organization with clubs all over the world. It's basically like a speech class that never ends. You go to meetings every week or two and then practice giving speeches in front of the ~15 or so members. What was beautiful about joining is that most people who join did it for the same reason I did: they were terrified of public speaking! 

I've been in Toastmasters for five years now. I still get a little anxious speaking in front of large groups, but every time I do it, it gets easier and easier. I recently volunteered to be the Emcee/host for my sister's wedding in a few weeks which I'm really looking forward to.

TLDR: it may sound terrifying, but Toastmasters is a wonderful resource to those with social anxiety: &lt;a href=""http://reports.toastmasters.org/findaclub/""&gt;Find a Club&lt;/a&gt;

 There must a sadistic god, because every time I head upstairs to take the express elevator down the doors ALWAYS open at the exact same time as the normal elevator my coworkers took, and I just assume they'll tilt their head at me and wonder how on earth I got down so fast or why I would go upstairs to go down and I'll just feel my face flush with red embarassment.

&gt; A surefire way to feed anxiety is by anticipating the future and imagining the disasters that may lie ahead. Looking into the future, you can suffer humiliations and defeats that haven't even happened, and if you replay these thoughts, you can end up suffering an imaginary event many times. or you can travel in the other direction and make yourself even more miserable as you look back in time and relive whatever you may have suffered in the past, and then imaginatively travel into the future to live it again and again. Anticipation of the future is what generates anxiety. If you habitually live with fearful thoughts about the future, you can be reasonably assured that your anxieties will grow and multiply. Sometimes this is called ""future tripping."" It's like Miracle-Gro for anxitey, which explains why anxiety is often paired with the word ""anticipatory,"" as in anticipatory anxiety. If you review anticipated disasters again and again, you can water this seed of anxiety into a regular nightmare.

I'm not sure where to start, but I'll start off by saying I live in Australia since some of what I say might sound alien to people from other 
countries.

I turned 17 a couple months ago and I've been struggling with anxiety since I'd guess around 8 years old. It progressively got worse to the point where, at the start of year 9 (a couple months in), I did not leave my house for about 1 and a half years. After having the police come to my house to try to force me to go to school (it didn't work) and psychiatrists visiting my house, this is when I learned I suffered from social anxiety disorder. This is also the time I'd say the anxiety peaked.

After the almost 2 years of isolation, I went back to school and was put in year 10 near the end of the year (which my friends were in). The school had me in the library for a few weeks and not actually in class, which demotivated me to the point where I stopped going back again. There's a period of 3-4 months where I'm now at home, and had a sudden confidence boost. During this time, I lost a tonne of weight (almost half of it) and occasionally saw friends outside of school, something I hadn't done for a very long time. At the start of the year after I left for the second time, the school gives me another chance to come back in an actual class on one condition: I'm now a year behind all my friends (starting at year 10 again). I did go back, and I'm not sure if any of you were in this situation, but being at school a year behind all of your friends and being excluded from things that their year was doing and you weren't (excursions, for example) was the worst feeling I've ever had. I couldn't make any friends in my new year and the only time I saw my actual friends was doing breaks. I was able to stand it for about half a year, and I left about 3 months ago. There are no more chances, I'm not able to go back to school because I'm too old and I have no certificate whatsoever saying that I completed school. 

You might think after that things only went downhill after that. Well, not yet. My friends are awesome, and really helped me with my anxiety. They took me out to places to eat, net cafes, etc which were things I had never done before and wouldn't have been able to without their help. But that's not all: My friends got me a job at where they worked at Dominos Pizza. What made it easy for me to get this job was the fact that I didn't need to get an interview. Unfortunately, this is where it started to go downhill.

I had my job for 4 days total before needing to be told by my friend that the boss didn't think I was right for the job. This crushed the little hope I had about my future, the fact that I couldn't hold a job at a fast food place for more then a week. I'm petrified of even attempting to EVER try to get a job at a fast food place again, and I don't know what place would even accept me considering I have no qualifications, not even a school certificate and the fact that I have social anxiety.

So, it's been about four weeks since I lost my first job and I've just been sitting in my house each day thinking of what the hell I'm going to do. I'm guessing this isn't helping, but each day I go on Facebook and see all my friends living life and not being locked up in a house each day. Many of them have jobs now, they'll be completing school next year and probably moving onto university or something. But I'm not going anywhere.

I feel like the almost two years I spent at home is what screwed me over. I was 14-16 during that time, some of the greatest years of my life just wasted away. Relationships, life skills and work ethic develop during that time and I just sat at home. I completely screwed over everything. I don't see where I'd be in the next 5 or 10 years.

If you read the entire thing, thanks I guess. I'm not sure what kind of answers I should expect, but I really felt like typing this up. I probably missed out a lot of key details because summing up the last 9-10 years of your life in 30 minutes or so is pretty hard, so if there's anything you're wondering just ask and I'll probably answer.

Thanks again.

It's like I keep people at arms length and any closer than that starts to freak me out and I avoid them. I'm really not close with anyone, not even my parents.

So a little bit about myself, I'm a freshman in college, had moderate social anxiety all my life. I say moderate because while I never had a ton of friends, haven't had a girlfriend, etc., if I was put in a situation where I had to talk to people I've always been able to decently carry on a conversation and appear competent. I'm even ok infront of large crowds, or small groups of people; good enough to even be asked to tutor for public speaking by my professor. But damn it when it comes to starting a one on one conversation with people I'm not close to, especially girls, I get nervous, my heart starts beating fast, my voice gets weak, and I often times just freeze up and say nothing at all. 

The particular issue I'm now is with a very cute girl in my biology class that came up to me and asked me to be in her lab group. She was pretty flirty throughout the whole lab and we got along really well. This was last monday. The past two times I've seen her before class (she sits right infront of me), you know what I've said? Fucking nothing. Not one word. I can't even bring myself to say hello. It makes no sense, she acted like she was at least somewhat into me, and I had no problem at all talking to her once a conversation got going. You would think this would give me confidence moving forward, but instead I'm making a complete idiot on myself every time I walk into that room. I've had success in the past with girls that have been outgoing and initiated the first few conversations with me, but this one seems either shy or is just waiting for me to make the first move. I'm also now nervous about lab next monday because I haven't said a damn thing to her and now we're going to be working together again. I feel like its too late to move past how badly I've fucked up these last few days. Anyways, I just don't know how to make myself take that first step, it seems physically impossible.

I took a gap year when I was done with school so I've been on an exceptionally long vacation-- until now. The reason I took a gap year was because my social anxiety was getting only worse towards the end of school. I actually had to go through this special sort of education to get through the last bits of school. Nothing too extreme, I was just isolated from the rest of the students, had my own teacher and got to leave and go to school at different times as the other students (so I wouldn't bump into anyone by chance). It's awesome that my school would set up something like that.

Now, I'll begin by saying that I'm completely socially crippled, which you'll find to be fairly accurate if you keep reading. I haven't gone outside nor met any of my friends in about a year and a half. I don't talk much to anyone over internet either as I always feel uneasy and struggle to find a good reply. The few times that I've had to go shopping or deal with any other necessary errands have been like hell to me. I start sweating and get just generally uncomfortable and wish that I could be at home.

A couple months ago I was invited to the entrance examinations of a school which I had applied to. I didn't want to apply but my parents said I had to. So, out of approximately a 100 applicants, 18 was chosen. I was one of them. And as where a normal person would spring with joy, I just feel depressed. As if going to the school for the entrance examinations wasn't hell enough, I'll have to go there again this very Monday. The thought of school makes me depressed, angry and uncomfortable.

I can barely even talk to anyone on the phone in rare occasions that someone may call me, nor can I chat in videogames without the fear of being ignored or made fun of. So how could anyone expect me to go through school? There will be people everywhere. I can't handle that, I always feel like I'm being stared at by *everyone*. And whenever someone laughs, I think it's me they're laughing about.

Anyways, that's it. I just wanted to get it off my chest.

Anytime I leave the house, it's either family related or I go out and drive just so my parents think I left the house and am not a complete loser.

I haven't been applying because I didn't get good grades and don't have any experience and no one's replied back in the couple of months I had been applying. I know the only way I'm going to get anyone to look at me is if I show up and talk to them but this freaks me out so much. I stopped talking to my college friends and then stopped talking to my only friend from high school and I've completely isolated myself from the outside world. The last time I left my house on a purpose of my own was when my book on Amazon got sold and I went to the post office to mail it but that was a couple of months ago as well.

I don't know what's going on. I'm basically waiting for my social anxiety to be over, but it wont be over if I stay in my house all day. But I can't leave because I have social anxiety. AHH. I don't think I'm depressed. I want to do stuff. I just don't have the energy to fight the anxiety anymore.

Social anxiety cost me an important relationship in my life. In summary: Fell in love with girl --&gt; Social anxiety didn't let me express my feelings --&gt; Girl gets with another guy --&gt; Use that as motivation to get over social anxiety.

So I learned the process of chatting with strangers through trial and error. I asked girls out randomly like ""Hi, you're cute. Want to get coffee sometime?"" (Which doesn't work) to saying compliments to people randomly, which 99% of the time brings a smile/thanks.

I did this thing called Rejection Therapy. http://www.rejectiontherapy.com where you ask things of people and get rejected once a day for 30 days. **It forces you to have to talk to strangers.** So if you get rejected, you win. If you get a date, friend, etc. you also win. It's win-win.

""Hi, do you have gum?"" Then someone will either give you gum or they say ""No""

Then you realize the worse people can do is say ""No."" It reduces your fear of rejection because it makes you get used to it instead of avoiding it.

Then I got into /r/seduction to learn how to date women and communicate/express myself well. I'm not in the camp that wants to get with as many girls as possible. I'm in the camp that wants to learn how to create authentic attraction.

I think it's more appropriate here, since the CBT group I'm involved in is for my Social Anxiety, primarily.

Here's the post:

I'm currently involved in a Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy program to address my severe social anxiety, with a primary focus on my phobic reaction to public speaking. First of all, I want to say that I see many of you are unhappy with your therapeutic programs and your prescriptions. I completely understand, I tried 2 counselors, 1 psychiatrist, and countless medications (prescribed and illicit) to no avail. Finally, last year, I found an awesome CBT clinic for panic and anxiety disorders nearby, and it has COMPLETELY changed my life. I recommend you all do some research on local CBT clinics (they are, unfortunately, not incredibly easy to find). So, the Behavioral part of CBT involves creating a hierarchy of ""Exposures"", which are situations characteristic of those that cause you severe anxiety, ranked in order from least-anxiety-provoking and least-likely-to-avoid to most-anxiety-provoking and most-likely-to-avoid. Your task is to start doing these exposures (often times as role-plays in the safety of your therapist's office) until you retrain your brain to realize that you aren't in danger (it's more complicated than that, but I'm sure you're already sick of reading). I am scheduled to give a presentation about myself tomorrow in class, which is my absolute highest-end exposure. A year ago I wouldn't even be thinking about doing this. Tonight I feel pretty capable, a manageable amount of nervousness, and a tiny bit of excitement to do it. Really guys, I suggest looking into CBT. Even if there isn't a clinic nearby, there are tons of great workbooks that will walk you through the process. Sometimes people are 100% successful doing it themselves. Thanks for reading, this subreddit has also provided a major space for me to feel comfortable and not so crazy. I truly appreciate that.

TL; DR: read the title

UPDATE: I just got back from the class I had to present in, and it went AWESOMELY! I volunteered to go first, something I'd never have done in the past. I was nearly puking with nerves beforehand, my anticipatory anxiety is always horrible, but as I got into it I started to habituate and the whole thing went incredibly well. My Professor even said I set the bar really high for subsequent presentations. Thank you all for your comments and support, really. I checked this thread before my class and was incredibly comforted by all of your words. Truly. Thanks again!

Both worsened for several years in high school until I started following for musicians and attending their shows.  I started to group up with people going, and became more positive and social.  My depression never really went away from 8th grade, to past graduation Senior year....until now.  **I am no longer depressed.**  I woke up this morning in my normal routine, thinking, ""oh this is the time of day I start to feel lonely and rejected and awkward and-"" but I didn't.  I don't ever remember feeling this happy.  And it wasn't even that I was that happy, it was just that I couldn't think of that many things to be pessimistic about anymore.

After attending a music festival this past weekend, I was able to boost my self-confidence and reduce the stress of my social anxiety.  I went with a new-ish group of highschool friends, and I enjoy their company so much.  We all hooked up with people from another group, and I found I was damn good at dancing :)  I discovered new genres of music I like, and I can talk with more people about music in new ways.  I feel less self-conscious about how I look, and more willing to improve upon my physical appearance.   I am visiting a stylist to get a new haircut/hairstyle this week (no longer worried and embarrassed enough to stay home), I am starting a regular workout routine, I am taking drum lessons, and I am socializing with me new roommates at school!  I also have a full time paid internship.  

This all happened so fast and at such a perfect time in my life, but I really have no one to thank but my friends, myself, the people behind the making of the festival, and this subreddit.    

I wanted to share this with the community here to let people know that **shit improves if you force yourself out of your comfort zone.** I was very depressed and lonely throughout much of highschool...now that it is over, my social anxiety is a much lesser worry in my life.  I realized I am way more attractive than I convinced myself I was.  *Always* stay positive!  Even though it doesn't feel quite right, stay positive!  I have work to do still, but I have never felt so much like myself in my lifetime.

This isn't the first time we've had issues because of my anxiety, but it hit pretty hard last night. My boyfriend of 4 years has always been an extrovert.

We're in college, and this turned into him wondering if he'll ever regret not having a ""real"" college experience because of me, basically.

I've been on and off of several medications, I've been in and out of therapy, but at this point I'm doing neither.  I'm just trying to live and be as ""normal"" as I can, go to work, try to have friends, put myself in difficult situations and handle them as well as I can.  It's still a daily struggle, but I have a pretty supportive boyfriend and I've gotten pretty good at faking my way through the more uncomfortable situations.  

Anyway.  The other day me and the bf were in the car, and I was relaying how I feel uncomfortable about a recent encounter with a work friend- we hung out outside of work for this first time (which is always a little awkward for anyone, I suppose) and the conversation went like this:  

**Me:** I don't know, it was okay.  I just make everything awkward.  
**BF:**  You're really not that awkward though.  You're cute.  You say ""gosh"" and you get genuinely excited about Halloween craft projects.  People can't help but like you.  

...I don't know why, but for some reason, him saying that flipped a switch in my brain.  It was like suddenly I could almost see myself how other people must see me.  And the thing is... I'm kind of okay with it.  Like, I know I'm a dork.  But I'm also funny, and I honestly try to be nice to people.  I do get excited about ridiculous things, and I like to think my excitement is contagious.  I'm good at making witty comebacks, I have a strange ability to make associations and link ideas together.   

I guess I'm starting to realize that a lot of my anxiety is tied up in the idea that I honestly just want people to like me.  I worry about it a lot, actually.  I hadn't really realized it before or been able to verbalize it quite like this.  But I care if people like me.  I get the most anxious around people who don't like me (or at least, in my skewed perception they don't).  I almost hate admitting that because I spent SO MUCH of my youth/teen years trying SO HARD to pretend I didn't give a fuck about what anyone thought.  But of course inside I was obsessed with what everyone else thought, or else I wouldn't have social anxiety.  Social anxiety is the other end of narcissism.  Instead of being obsessed with how awesome I am all the time, I'm constantly fretting over what I did wrong.  

I don't know what the point of my story is here.  It's just hard to look at yourself objectively (and obviously you never can, your own subjectivity remains at the forefront no matter what you do).  But most of the time when I have tried, all I see are flaws.  Now I'm making a conscious effort to view myself *in a positive light* the way (I hope) other people do.

Basically my life is not where I want it to be, and a large part of that is down to social anxiety/problems. It's a bit ridiculous, but the main problem is erythrophobia (fear of blushing). To those of you who have it or have had it, you know how freaking awful it is. I've got quite a red complexion anyway, (and go super red after sport, or if it's hot - which I don't REALLY mind because then I have a reason) and this redness holds me back in a lot of ways, even academically believe it or not (presentations, asking questions in hot classrooms etc).

Now it doesn't make totally unsociable by any means, I have lots of friends, but it is a problem I would like to overcome.

Anyway, I want to get over this and improve my social skills, so this summer I plan to practise pickup (not the scummy kind-the kind that improves me), lift weights, try a vegan (or nearly vegan) diet etc. I also plan to get a job that constantly pushes me socially, as I know from previous experience that the more time I have to sit around and contemplate things instead of actually talking to people, the worse I get. I was thinking of applying in lots of restaurants (waiter) and bars, what do you think?

I'm going into my final year of uni next year, we have to do many many presentations, I do not want to be so worried about standing up in front of people that I can't focus on doing actually good work. 

Are there any other things I can do to improve socially? Or just any tips or advice generally would be great:) Any at all. I am thinking about taking up meditation as well, as it supposedly helps you live in the moment. Most of the happiest people I know live totally in the moment.

 (1) I was curious if any of you have ever had the experience of really trying (I mean REALLY trying) your best to push your limits and then all your efforts got really disappointing response by friends or family?

I feel discouraged and I'm looking for any answers/advice you can offer.

Like some of you SA has really put quite a dent in my life. I work through a temp agency and do factory work because I can't really do anything else. I don't have a car because I'm afraid of having to interact with the people at the DMV to get my temps or license. I only shop at Walmart because its open late at night and I can go when no one else is there. I usually only go through drive thrus or get take out when I don't want to cook. I'm estranged from my family and most of my high school friends. I don't go to school because I'm so scared of even going through the orientation. I have two friends of questionable quality. They're pretty much my angel on one shoulder and devil on the other in the way that one is very encouraging and the other is just... I live with him and he is... very discouraging. (Don't fret about that too much I'm moving out in a month :D)

 Just recently I've been trying to go to places that make me feel horrible to make sure I don't get sucked down too deep (well...deeper) into my SA. I've made some progress but people around me aren't too impressed, I can only say ONE person is really impressed with my progress. I know for most of you talking to someone you don't know doesn't really tickle your fancy - This is my most recent experience relating to my question. The other day I decided instead of going through the drive thru of the local Culver's I would go in and try to order my food face to face. I went with my very discouraging friend who knows about my SA. After I stammered through my order and felt incredibly proud of myself since that was the first time in about a year I've even attempted to order for myself. He says ""Wow.. watching you talk to people is hilarious. You make it so fucking awkward."" The level of judged and self conscious I felt was significant. :(

(2) Have you ever been bullied by someone who knows you have SA to watch you have SA?

This guy is a jerky jerk. He's forced me to go to pick n save, walmart, restaurants in the middle of the day and then has left me there and watched from a far. I definitely may or may have not puked in a parking lot and he thought it was hilarious.

Perhaps my SA probably gets in the way of me having quality friends because I think people with SA are a manipulative persons playground. Yes no?

I'm also looking for some people with SA to chat with. I don't get out much and I do like talking to people I can't see or hear. :)",,False,,t5_2r22n,False,,,True,t3_1cxba1,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1cxba1/theres_always_that_one_friend/,

I absolutely should be studying for the exams I have later in the week, but I am taking a short break to more or less get off my chest how much I need other people.

I am a university student I've *always* been the quiet, stoic guy for as long as I can remember. I always get so stressed about things (like upcoming exams) and today I worked with a study group to go over some stuff. I actually did pretty well from a conversational standpoint, but I in the midst of the studying my classmates were getting texts from their friends and SO's etc. and it made me realize how alone I am. 

It made me realize that it's not just being conversational, it's also being intimate and making connections with people. I've been very fortunate to have a very good academic career, but I always get stressed about big (and little) things. Others, even people who enjoyed the academic success that I did, seemed to be reasonably stressed, but not quite like me.

However I think the primary problem is that while we may personally not believe these things any longer, we still believe *that others believe* we're embarassing, socially awkward etc. The big problem with being so sensitive to social cues is that we attach enormous importance to the opinions, thoughs and beliefs of other people. 

So I think a second, more important barrier that has to be broken down is that we stop automatically viewing the opinions and beliefs of others as rational or reasonable, especially on the subject of social interactions and relationships. If there is no reason to accept your own hunches about being an embarassment, awkward, etc. then there is no reason to accept other people's opinion of you on the same subject either.

1342638195.0,32,self.socialanxiety,wrvmy,I'm helping myself to beat my SA. Maybe this will help you too.,SeductionNovice,33,1,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/wrvmy/im_helping_myself_to_beat_my_sa_maybe_this_will/,"Hi all.

I've been suffering from SA for years. I also suffer from agoraphobia and panic disorder. But this year, I decided to change all that. I was suffering everyday, I could not endure more pain. I still have a lot of fears but I've managed to get a more comfortable life now.

I read a lot of books on CBTs and it has helped me a lot. I'm not the most social person right now but I'm getting better and better at talking to people.
This is what have worked for me so far:

* Since I suffer from agoraphobia, I force myself to get out of my home everyday. Everyday. May it be a little walk or a long ride. Some days it's hard, but the anxiety level I experience always drop at some point. I used to have full-blown panic attacks everytime I took the train. So, what I did was to take the train as much as I can. It was hard at first, but now I'm able to travel by train with almost minimal anxiety. I'm sure in a few weeks I won't have any anxiety in a train.

* Everytime I fear something (I mean a social situation), I force myself to do it. It's awkward, it's scary, it makes me start having panic attacks (I've had hundreds of them in my life, and I'm not exagerating. If you already had one in your life, you know how scary it is). But the more I do it, the less frightening it is. For example, I was (still am but less) afraid to talk to girls (leading to a shitty love life... but that's not the point). What I did was going to the street, and try to talk to girls. At first, I could not speak to any girl without having a panic attack. I was shaky, my voice was trembling, I was hyperventilating (you know, breathing like dogs). So, as you can imagine, I was very creepy while talking to those girls, and I've been rejected dozens of times. But the goal was to beat my fear by facing it the most I could. You know what? Some girls were very friendly. And I realised that nothing happened to me. What scared me the most was to say to a girl she was beautiful, so I was regularly going to the streets, and I told girls than I found them attractive. Doing this has become normal for me now (BTW guys, you should check out /r/seduction). To be honest, I'm still a bit shaky while doing this, and I'm still not even able to have a conversation without being completely relaxed, but I can tell you that I'm less afraid than when I started months ago. I won't lie, I have a lot of moments when I'm discouraged and depressed, and I want to give this up. But then I tell myself how crappy my life was before. So when I look back to what I did, I'm proud of myself. 

* Do little things by yourself. This one seems irrelevant but it has helped me a lot to get over my depression and self-esteem issues. Everyday, I try to do little things. For example, I congratulate myself when I make my bed. I try to cook my own food. I do 5 push-ups a day. All that tells your brain that you're not a failure, and you are capable of doing things. And that you can take action. So, if people do things for you (e.g. if your mother always cooks for you) then try to do those things by yourself. Be in control of your life. 

* Stop beating yourself mentally. Please, stop it. Stop blaming yourself for not being the best social person ever. We all are humans, some people are better at socializing, some others have more difficulties. But, it's not because you can't make friends (for the moment) that you're inferior. If you keep telling yourself that you're a failure, you will act as so. I think it's called a [self-fulfilling prophecy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-fulfilling_prophecy) in psychology. You have the right to fail. But if you are still skeptical about this, try what I did. I tried to fail as hard as I can in every social situation. It was scary at first, and I was afraid of rejection but then I realized that people where less hard with me that I was with myself. Try to fail. And see what happens. 

* Try to get involved in as much social situations as possible. The more you avoid these situations, the more you tell your brain ""there is a danger to be in contact with people!"" and, consequently, the more hard your SA will be. On the contrary, the more you stay with people, the more your anxiety will drop. Our body is not designed to stay anxious all the time. At some point, you will feel that you are relieved. If you don't believe me, try it by yourself. If a somebody invites you to a party where you don't know anybody, say yes. Go for it. Things will be fucking awkwards for sure. But do it. Just to show your body that nothing harmful will happen to you. If somebody you don't know visits your parents, don't stay in your room. Go out to tell him hello. 
Just ban the word ""no"" from your dictionary :) Always say yes to people !

* List your fears on a sheet of paper. Try to face one fear every day. Once you've faced it, crossed it out on your paper. You may want to start with the less frightening fears at first, then move to the most scary ones. This is hard. I know. But you have to do it to be free from your SA. I used to be scared to talk on the phone. So I wrote it out on my paper. One day, I took my phone and called somebody whom I was not comfortable with. See this as a game. You win if you do it. The victory is not when you succed to have a great discussion. Even if the conversation is awkward, you win. Even if that person doesn't answer, you win. The only thing to do to win is to face your fear.

tl;dr: try to face your social fears as much as you can. It's hard, and it requires a lot of courage, but this is the most efficient way to get rid of your SA. If you do it EVERYDAY, your life will be better in only a few weeks, I promise.

Bonus: You may be addicted to beating your fears. That feeling when you are no longer scared of something is just amazing. 



I hope it'll help somebody.

1368385933.0,32,self.socialanxiety,1e73zb,A great method that worked wonders for me :),kid-vicious,36,4,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1e73zb/a_great_method_that_worked_wonders_for_me/,"So I've begun to realize what most of my social anxiety stems from. I'm curious if it might be the same for you guys. It's not easy to explain, but it's easy to understand, so hear me out. After much thought, I started to see that all my social anxiety is.. is the FEAR that one of my *other* FEARS or insecurities will be exposed to everyone.

For example, here are a list of my biggest fears and insecurities:
*I fear that I am socially awkward
*I fear that I am ""weirder"" than most people
*I am insecure about my crooked teeth
*I am insecure that I am skinny
*I am insecure about the fact that I haven't had sex with many girls

So my social anxiety, at its core, is just the FEAR that one of those things will be exposed to everyone. The FEAR that one of those things will become apparent and that everyone will ridicule you for it which makes your fear REAL. That is social anxiety in my opinion.

So think to yourself what the WORST case scenario would be..

-People will notice my crooked teeth and everyone will ridicule me for it?
-The fact that I am inexperienced with girls will come to light and everyone will ridicule m for it ?
-Someone will say I'm ugly or fat and everyone will ridicule me for it, heightening my negative body image ?

First of all, most people are WAY too caught up in their own head in their own little world to ever really notice little details about YOU. So lets drop our egos.

But anyway, just once you realize the WORST case scenario, you begin to realize how ridiculous your fears are. Think about it, what are the odds you ACTUALLY make a fool of yourself and everyone ridicules you and laughs at you ? How many times has this happened to you in your life ? No more than a couple times for the average person, I would say. It just doesn't happen. It's all fear. So once you have that worst case scenario in mind, remember it. Then at the end of your social interaction, reflect on how things ACTUALLY went. Then compare to your worst fear and you begin to see how irrational and ridiculous your fears were.

I tried this the other night for the first time and it worked wonders. I was invited out to a few bars with some friends that I occasionally hang out with. Anxiety immediately kicked in. That old familiar feeling. Excuses started running through my mind ""Oh, it's too far.."" ""Eh, I'm tired""..""Not tonight man, I feel like staying in.""..""I went out already this week.."" Ect.

But then I tried this method. I realized my anxiety was coming from my fear of being awkward. I feared that my supposed social ineptness would be exposed. So I then I realized the WORST case scenario would be that I show up and wait around awkwardly until they show up (if they do) and then they get there, aren't too happy to see me, I tag along awkwardly the entire time and probably make a fool of myself at some point and they never hang out with me again. 

Right then I began to laugh and say ""Wow."" What are the chances that actually happens?  So I said I would go out, see how the night actually goes, and then compare to my fears. So I got to the bar, saw another friend who wasn't with the group on the way there, said what's up to him as he was glad to see me, then walked into the bar to meet my friends. I walked up to them, they all smiled and gave me hugs as they were already settled and drinking. 

I realize it's a beer/wine bar only, so as a liquor guy who hates both of those, I order a root beer in a bottle. It tastes delicious. A friend asks what I'm drinking and exclaims that she wants one too, so she buys one herself. I conversate with everyone, we play some games, and eventually they realize the place is a bit boring, so we decide to head to a local diner and grab some food. We eat a delicious meal and everyone parts ways for the night.

No embarrassment, no ridicule, no making a fool of myself. I actually felt some what like I was leading most interactions and people wanted to talk to ME.

**TL:DR**

*Write down your fears and insecurities and be honest with yourself
*Consider that your social anxiety may stem from one of those things being exposed to everyone.
*When anxiety kicks in, recognize which of the fears/insecurities it is that you fear are going to be exposed
*Then think what the **worst** case scenario would be. You'll probably already begin to ease your nerves when you see how absurd your worst fear actually is.
*After your social interaction (party, date, meeting) is over, reflect on how things ACTUALLY went and compare to your worst fear. You'll likely see how irrational and absurd your fears and anxieties are.

Feel good about yourself regardless of what people say and how you feel they act around you. Just be yourself and express yourself accordingly. 

Detail: 
I had a tough time getting over the fear of judgement, especially with women. Luckily I am beginning to see it differently. I exercise a lot now. Seeing progress over just the pass few months makes it feel like I can do anything. I know it's hard to start, but baby steps are better than no steps. You may not be in the best shape or have everything you want, but who is stopping you. Sadly it's us.

Surprisingly, I spoke briefly with a girl I would have dreamt about talking to had I not made it what I wanted and let myself do the magic. It's almost instinctual at that point; you feel the urge and you act. That doesn't mean go sky diving because you like roller-coasters, but you get the idea. It takes time. I can't even describe how good it feels just to know that I had the courage to have a normal conversation/introduction with, like I said, a beautiful girl.

Never think you're not worth it. It's a waste of time. We have to work towards making our lives what we want them to be. If you don't like the hand your dealt, change it as best you can. When you feel inspired don't question or doubt it for being stupid. You felt a stroke of brilliance, typically for a reason. That alone is worth the time.

Conclusion:
Anyways I hope all you SA sufferers catch my drift. It's a day-to-day life. Take your time and enjoy it for what it is. Everybody take the time to pat yourself on the back for how far you've come because it's not easy, but it's worth it in the end.

i don't think its really a secret that clubs are a huge trigger for my social anxiety and all the other horrible feelings and thoughts that come with it. At the club i could feel that sickness in my stomach get bad and after a few drinks my friend and i noticed a girl looking at me. It took me probably about 5 minutes (and some threats that my friend would go up and introduce me if i didn't do it myself) to go up to her and ask her to dance, something i have never done before. As i was walking toward her i could feel my stomach turning and the usual thoughts start to race but kept telling myself that this is all part of the process of getting better; asking her to dance would be a kind of achievement. i asked her and she said yes. we danced for maybe 2 minutes until i had a panic attack and made up some excuse that i had to meet my friends, i could see in her face she could tell i was lying. i apologized and excused myself 

After i left the dance floor i was (i think visibly) shaking and decided i needed to leave the club asap to try to calm down. On my way home i started having all those usual self hating thoughts about leaving, not dancing longer with her, it took me too long to work up the courage to approach her, i looked like an idiot, the girl wasn't even interested in me, the list goes on. 

Then something changed my thoughts, i thought about it and told myself that i would have never been able to do that 6 months ago. I tried to think of some negative counterargument but i couldn't think of anything. i was right i wouldn't have been able to do that 6 months ago. So while i still have all that anger and disappointment pointed at myself i'll try to focus on the fact that i have made progress and that this is a long long road to where i want to be. i'll take any gains i can get at this point and a step forward, no matter how small i think it is, is still a step forward. 

So next time you do something you think was stupid or embarrassing, try to take away one positive thing from it. some of the ones i use are ""this was a learning experience"" ""making mistakes/taking risks is all part of the process"" ""things won't change over night, keep chipping away"" and my newest one ""would i have been able to do this 6 months/a year ago?"".

I hope i my story had something useful to take away, i don't want to sound like i'm bragging or anything

TL;DR: went to a club danced with a girl for the first time but panicked and left. Instead of staying really pissed off at myself i told myself that i wouldn't have been able to do that 6 months ago and that i am making progress.",,False,,t5_2r22n,False,,,True,t3_147f1n,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/147f1n/a_story_of_how_i_am_slowly_trying_to_change_my/,

Few years ago public speaking was a nightmare for me. I would get really anxious and nervous during it, my hands as well as voice would start shaking which would make me nervous even more, it was horrible. I was close to blacking out. 
I hated speaking in front of people. It wasn't a lot better on 1on1 interaction and eye contact. 

So i worked hard to get rid of my problems, started with baby steps - spoke with sales assistants only few sentences, tried interacting more, keep eye contact with people I know or don't know. 
It started to get easier after some time but still I wasn't a person I wanted to be. 

So this say was my first ever important presentation in not my language. It was about tourism in East Asia. I started preparing for it few weeks before. During my preparation I always had positive thoughts about it, such as that I will do it without any problems or without stuttering without shaky voice. Only positive thoughts and no negativity. 

Started presentation and couldn't believe it i had no problems during It, my body language was great according to profesor, also he have said ei did really good with presenting and keeping eye contact. During presentation I got so proud of myself. I always wanted to talk in front of people without any anxiety and stress and it was finally happening. I started smiling at some point of presentation because of it. 
It's also a lot easier to speak with people without making it akward or without getting anxious. 

Also it was first time that I spoke in English longer than I've ever had. 

As for reason of this topic I don't know, I just wanted to tell someone about it. 
Remember you want things to change you have to work on it. If I havent done anything to fix my problems today's presentation would be horrible experience, but now it was awesome.

I can't talk to people or make friends anymore. I constantly worry what people think, if they will like me, if I'm annoying them, etc. Subconsciously, if someone says they like/dislike something, I sometimes find myself later using their opinion instead of mine. I change myself so that I can make other people (especially my boyfriend) happy. 

I used to have friends when I was younger, but I don't have any friends at uni and I'm graduating in a month. I have a boyfriend, so I wasn't forced to make any friends. There are some people we know but my boyfriend says that I shouldn't trust them and tell them so much. For example, our uni recently had a carnival day where everyone gets drunk and there are a bunch of rides and stuff to do. My boyfriend was out of town, so I just stayed in my room all day and didn't do any of the activities that everyone else does. A few days later I was lending a girl from class my notes and she asked what I did that day and why I didn't call her to hang out and I told her I didn't do anything, I just slept. I told my boyfriend this and he said I shouldn't have admitted that and I should've just made up something about being drunk and having a great day. 

This girl that I lent my notes to, she seems nice. We met because we had to work on a project together five days in a row. She invited me to go to a music performance with her, but I said no. She invited me to study with her one night and I actually did. My boyfriend got pretty jealous then and accused me of partying. But that isn't really the issue here, I know he's controlling. But anyway, after lending her my notes she said she was really thankful that I helped her out and she asked if I wanted to see a movie with her this weekend to thank me and I said okay. But my boyfriend says that she is just using me to get my notes and she probably doesn't want to be my friend because she goes weeks at a time without talking to me. But maybe it's my fault. I don't talk to her. I can't, unless she texts me first. I feel like I am supposed to text her this weekend about the movie but I can't. I don't know how to be normal anymore. 

I don't know what to do anymore. I just can't be social. I can't talk in class, even when it affects a major part of my grade. When I go to parties or class trips, I keep hoping that I will talk to people and be social, but I can't. I just can't talk to people unless I know them fairly well. 

I used to have online friends who I talked to, but after starting uni I became busy and we had a falling out. Now I can barely talk to people online anymore. I barely post on reddit because I worry so much about my posts or replies. 

I like watching tv shows because I feel like I can know people, but I won't be judged and I don't have to interact. I have a hard time starting new shows because then there are new characters that I have to get to know and form new opinions of. I tried telling my boyfriend this, but he just thought I sounded crazy. Sigh. 

I hate myself. I wish I could act, so that I could forget myself and just be someone with friends. ",,False,,t5_2r22n,False,,,True,t3_t9g3m,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/t9g3m/i_worry_what_people_think/,

How to calm down, how to keep perspective and focus in social situations, how to stop flipping the fuck out. 

And all the while, my inner dialogue keeps rearing its head (the very same inner dialogue that so consistently thwarts me when I try to be a regular, sociable human being). It's telling me that this must be a fault of mine, that I must be deficient somehow. That because of this, I can't succeed. That I'm a bad person. 

For a very long time, I have had trouble maintaining closeness with people because of a terrible fear that I would be discovered, and that on being discovered, who I was would not be liked. That I could not hold up my end of the relationship. For so long, I have put this down to my being a bad person and have been consumed by my inability to provide anything for the people around me, who I love, but who I'm impotent to give anything back to. But I am not a bad person.

Simply put, that person would not be here right now. In the place I'm in, trying to put things right. Spending so much time worrying about the wrongs I have done.

That other person is happy to let their careless remarks hurt, and their aloofness prove whatever point they want to make. I know our anxieties are a burden, but the fact that we have them proves we have a conscience. Downsize these worries, and the valuable quality of empathy - the kind that some more confident, but less caring individuals lack - is what remains, after you strip back all the over-analysis, self-criticism and paralysis. What we have, though it's all twisted up right now, is something worth celebrating. We already have something to give, and it's important not to keep underselling it. 

We may be impotent right now, but it is not through a lack of desire. That desire is a great thing. And it's one thing we don't deserve to criticise ourselves about.

I had a couple sessions with a therapist, I was completely relaxed, shared a ton of super personal information, realized I needed to be open and share painful truths so that he'd be able to help me.  It was pretty nice.  I didn't even notice the difference at first.

Then one session he ended it really ambiguously with a ""Well, I think that's it"" and I sat there all nervous, worrying what I should do, should I say something, does it look rude to just get up and leave, so I blurted out ""Anything else I should know?"" and he paused and asked what I meant and I go ""I didn't know what to do so I just blurted out the first awkward thing that came to my mind.  That's what awkward nerds do.""  He kind of went ballistic and it really confused me that he made a big deal about it.

Then I realized that while I was sitting there ""in therapy"" I had no anxiety, no drama, no issues, I knew that I only want to be truthful and there was no judging.  The only possible failure I could have is if I didn't tell him the abject truth and therefore it took longer for him to figure me out and help me.  The second he said that and I wasn't sure what I was supposed to do, it was like a giant gate slammed down, I had so much anxiety, drama, I had to figure out what he meant, what I should do, and I was paralyzed by fearing that I was going to do the wrong thing and ""fail"".

All of a sudden I realized all my issue came from being sure that I was going to fail in the social situation.  And it was suddenly 90% gone.  It was super easy to think ""I'm me, I'm going to do what I do, I don't care if other people don't like it, I don't care if they think I've failed, because if my goal is to just be me and do whatever I do, that's not failure"".  Bam, I now don't care.  I want to be around people and say whatever I'm going to say, I've met random people and just blurted out questions and gotten into conversations with them.

I haven't actually put it to much use, it's really hard to find social situations around here.  I'm really ready to chat up some girls and pounce on them, but I really need to finish losing my weight so I'm more of that charming guy with a good job, as opposed to that creepy fat balding guy.

Anyways, just hoped that someone would read it and see a bit of themselves and maybe it would help them.  It really struck me out of the blue and showed my issues in a whole new light that I never would have figured out myself.

Imagine you are a kid and your father is teaching you how to ride a bike. As you begin the process, you get on the bike and fall immediately. Instead of encouraging you to try again, your dad calls you stupid. A part of you withers away and dies inside, but you still want to try again. The next day your dad brings his friends to watch you fail. When you do, they laugh histerically and spill their beers all over you one by one. They say things like ""You shoulda used a condom"" and ""All the sperm that could've made it..."" as you sit on the sidewalk, broken and defenseless. 

I'm just about sick of the bullshit pseudo-optimismic attitude that learning to socialize is a fucking cakewalk. The people who imply this have clearly never had to worry about getting perpetually harassed for being awkward. I'm 19 years old and I have never had any close friends, a girlfriend or a job. If people get to know me, they will find out what a pathetic wretch I am. No matter how confident I act, these facts will deter them and they'll want nothing to do with me. 

If you want to help people, try to understand their mindset first.

I used to do this by constantly asking people if we were cool, over apologizing for everything and sometimes asking people why we hadn't talked for a while and then sending really uncomfortable messages that today I'm ashamed of sending.  

I also did things like:

* express an odd presumed intimacy that looking back on it, felt way too early and inappropriate/unexpected
* shared many tales of how others had mistreated me
* made it awkward for them and in the end and incredibly awkward for me too by coming across as needy, insecure, and over-disclosing far too much

* sought consolation/attention/reassurance because of my overbearing anxiety and fear that I did the wrong thing due to my anxiety

This is going to double as a post discussing something that I've thought about lately and a little vent session.

I'm restricting myself to ten minutes or else I'd go on for hours.

So, I am a first year student at a giant state university. I'm gearing up for finals in what has easily been one of the worst 4 months spans of my short life. No friends, grades that are horrendously below my standards, and a really bleak outlook. The highlight of my week? Calling my parents on Sundays. Yea. 

I really get the sense that I've lost control of my life, or that I was never in control in the first place.

I was bullied in eighth grade. Came into high-school pissed at the world and desperate to prove to myself I was worth something. I made straight A's all four years from working my ass off and pretty much studying constantly to be #1. Got into an excellent (as far as state schools go) uni with a partial scholarship. But I wasn't happy those four years. I had some ""friends"" in high-school, but I never partied or visited with them. I felt I couldn't open up to people, and I still don't know why. I survived this by having a very, very stable family with understanding parents and tolerable, healthy siblings.

Now, in college, I'm on my own, and I see everyone else going out there and succeeding, whereas I'm having an extremely hard time adjusting, to everything. 

**Anyway, so I got to thinking today, about something that I'm sure has crossed your minds' at some point in time...**

Would I want to be friends with, or look up to, someone like me? I could answer honestly, that no, I probably wouldn't. On the outside, I don't go out. On the outside, I don't really offer anything to people--I'm not ""useful."" On the outside, I'm not friendly. I probably don't even come across as particularly trustworthy. I'm not ""fun."" I'm not a very positive or inspiring person either. Why would someone want to be around me? 

But then I got to thinking, that's not me at all. I like to think I'm funny, intelligent, helpful, genuine, trustworthy, and I at least have the potential to be positive and inspiring (even though things are rough right now). I mean, my main account  has some 15,000 comment karma after less than a year on here. (That means I spend a lot of time on here, but also that people are listening and appreciating what I say).  

But *nothing* that I'm putting out there would lead people to believe this. How could they ever know who I am to be friends with me in the first place?

I'm 19 now. I can't tell you how often I wish I could go back to my 8 year old self, or my 11 year old self, or my 14 year old self, or even my last month self, and tell him not to be so worried, to enjoy the ride and speak up when appropriate--maybe even speak up when it isn't ;) . 

I only wish my 40 year old self would come and tell me to stop being so needlessly worried now, and to come out of my shell a little more.

Anyway, I have to buckle down for finals week. And since I'm sure many of you are also HS, uni or post-uni students who don't have the immediate support system that our more sociable counterparts do, I want to be the one you gives you that support. So PM me if you need a little pick me up.

But also, make sure you think about it. Would *you* want to be friends with yourself? And if not, is it because the real you isn't what's out there? 

Thanks for reading. Went well over my 10-minute mark but I hope this resonates with some of you.

I've had this crippling condition for as long as I can remember. I just want to say that you will have your ups and downs. On the days where you are really down, don't let it get to you too bad. I know how tempting it is to just stop fighting and get sucked into that vortex of negative emotion, but you can't give up hope. 

One of the things I realized with social anxiety is it doesn't make you any less of a person. The assholes that judge you for a problem that is largely not your fault are insensitive. Unfortunately, there are a lot of people out there that don't understand what we go through and even more that want to judge us for it.

But social anxiety is not you. Don't identify yourself with this problem. I remember reading stories about others struggling with this problem that said they overcame it. I thought to myself ""I'm different, they didn't struggle as badly as I did, mine is much harder to overcome"". It's not true, I've gotten better over the years and I keep getting better only because I refuse to let it rule my life. It's hard to imagine a life without it, but you have to start accepting that it is a possibility. 

There will be days where you feel like you have failed. Where you haven't made any progress at all and you are still the same. It's just more negative thoughts skewing your view of reality. You just have to let it pass and remember to enjoy the good days.

Don't let this problem get further into your head. Don't think of yourself as less of a person for it. There is a tendency for us to blame ourselves for everything. But the reality is society is not understanding towards individuals with this problem.

It's hard, trust me I know. But how you view this problem is just as important as overcoming it. If you don't internalize that you can beat this or at the very least get control of your life, you've already lost half the battle.

1341469296.0,30,self.socialanxiety,w2ee5,"How I, a (female) SA sufferer, successfully used Craigslist as a dating site.",,41,11,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/w2ee5/how_i_a_female_sa_sufferer_successfully_used/,"I have no idea if anyone will find this useful. It's obviously not for everyone, but it worked well for me. (For reference, at the time of postings, I was a female in my early 20's. I assume the experience would be different for males.) A few reasons why I think it worked:

- Once I've gotten to know somebody on the internet, I feel a lot better about meeting them in person. I usually tell them I am shy and awkward which takes the pressure off.

- Most of my anxiety is group anxiety.

- I only met people who had similar interests, which meant I could come up with discussions topics beforehand and I was already well-versed.

- I warm up to the opposite sex, in a one-on-one setting, fairly well; not so with the same sex (other girls terrify me, not sure why).

I only considered Craigslist as a tool to meet people because a (pretty, outgoing) girl I met while trying to find a roommate told me she ""met all her boyfriends on Craigslist."" A few weeks later I was in a new place with no friends and no idea how to meet anyone. I cautiously posted a personal ad in WFM. I was surprised by the response; hundreds of emails poured in. Of course, 90% of them were just creeps looking to get laid, and 9% were nice guys who just weren't my type. That being said, over the course of a year and a half, I have met 5 people total who I've had relationships of some sort with through this method (good relationships too!). I've gone on only one date that didn't turn into something more, which was mutual and good-natured.

If you try this, things to keep in mind:

- First, **never ever meet somebody in a secluded or private area.** Do not give them your address, do not go to their house. *Always* meet in a very public place (not a rural park, Starbucks or something!), in the daytime. Be cautious! If you can, tell family/friends where you're going, who you're meeting with, and any other information you have. Even if someone seems nice online, it's not worth the risk. Meet in public, in daylight, until you have gotten to know this person. (This risk isn't somehow unique to Craigslist! I would never go home with someone from a bar, for example. Just be safe.)

- Post a picture. Even decent people want to know what you look like.

- Make it very clear what you're looking for. I always said I was not looking for sex because most CL browsers are there for that reason only and it might deter some of them. Say whether you're interested in a casual relationship, a serious relationship, etc. You can't do this if you just meet someone in a bar -- take advantage of the opportunity to be on the same page.

- Expect a lot emails from gross people, and just ignore them. I found it pretty easy to weed out the creeps. Anybody that mentions anything sexual shouldn't be worth your time. There are also *some* spammers (I think they're rampant if you're posting as a male; as a female, I got a few) but they're easy to spot. Short, always stuff about sex/money. If you're really looking for a relationship, you wouldn't respond anyway. **EDIT: For clarification, you're probably going to receive photos of erect penises. I personally only received one, but it's something you should expect so you're not absolutely horrified. Gross, I know, but that appears to be how things work on the internet. :/** 

- Be detailed with your interests and be very clear what you're looking for (another bookworm? folk music fan?). Many people will ignore them. If it's obvious they have no idea what you're into even though you've already explained, ignore them. If they can't take the time to read your ad and compose an actual response, then they're likely just looking for sex and aren't interested in getting to know you.

- Make it clear you want to get to know someone online first and then do so. Write back and forth a lot. Be totally honest. If they're no longer interested, that sucks, but it's better they find out while you're conversing online than on your first real date, when you're already anxious.

- Don't give up. I'm pretty amazed with some of the people I've met, awesome, *normal* guys who I am so lucky to have had in my life. But out of the maybe 5 - 6 times I posted over the course of a year and a half, I only met 5 good guys. Not everyone out there is someone you can warm up to and you shouldn't be expected to. Find someone who is similar to you and you feel a connection with. Great people *do* go on Craigslist to meet people for genuine relationships.

I know most people think this is pathetic and I generally keep it to myself since Craigslist is associated with bad things. But if you're willing to read a lot of emails, this is a good way to put yourself out there, locally, for free, for a relationship that starts low-anxiety (online) but can build to be something more. I've always had such a tough time meeting people that this truly gave me human connection when I had no other way to find it.

The woman was really nice and left a message telling her to call her back. I waited until the next day because well, I figured it was late and that I'd let her go home and not bother her. I tell myself all night in preparation for this; *I will call her back, it will be okay.* So the next morning, I go to call her and freeze. I start panicking, I cant do it, and one thing led to another and I am huddled in a ball under the blankets crying to myself about how much of a miserable failure I am, and upset with myself, and having a near full-blown panic attack. I end up finally calling her at 11:45 AM ( 3 Hours later ) and everything was okay - my heart was racing and I felt like I was going to vomit, but I was okay. I ended up getting the interview, now tomorrow I have to wake up bright and early and put on my professional look. Not really much else to say, I just want to share with people that can relate to me.

UPDATE: Went to the interview today, went in 20 minutes early, because I wanted to make a good impression. I think I over thought it, and the owner told me she wasn't ready for me yet, and to just wait for her to be through. I felt like a complete fool, and started thinking *OhGodOhGodOhGod* Went back to do the interview, initial nervous stuttering and shaking, jittery hands and sweaty palms aside - I feel a **huge** relief. I felt it went extremely well, in part due to the fact she spoke to me more like a friend would than an interviewer. It really helped me feel a bit more comfortable. We even ended the interview with a socially awkward hug and I'll see her again this Wednesday for my trial employment period! **Thank you so much to everyone who told me they were proud of me and that I could do it!

Today (well technically yesterday) was my birthday and I had a bunch of people over to my apartment for a party. Eventually a lot of them left and it was just me, two of my best friends, and two friends that I don't know that well yet. The conversation was about love and relationships which was okay, even though I don't have much experience on the topic but it quickly escalated into talking about sex. I'm still a virgin, I just turned 22. I've been dating a guy for 7 months now but we both have similar anxiety issues and are okay with taking it slow. Anyway I immediately felt incredibly left out. Then I felt like my 2 best friends there had become better friends with these people then they are with me, even though they've known me for years and them for only a few months. Then I thought they all probably thought I was pathetic and inexperienced, then I realized I hadn't said anything for a good 20 minutes and no one probably even noticed because no one ever notices and everyone around me always ends up being closer friends with each other then they are with me because as far as I've come I still suck at socializing in many many ways. So I lied and said I was going to sleep and they left and now I just feel sad and worried.

I know we all get these trains of thoughts and they're often not even remotely true. So how do you all turn them off? My mom has suggested finding a mantra I can repeat in my head whenever I start thinking like that. Problem is I can't think of anything. How do you all cope?

I've had social anxiety for most of my life, though I thought it was shyness for years. My situation can be summarized by never wanting to go anywhere people are unless they are very close friends, but I still do against my brains best judgement.

I'm from a family where addictions are easy to come by and I know why. I just feel like being alone on the bottom of a bottle sometimes. But I don't, because that would be pointless. But you know that I know what I'm talking about even if I'm not a worst case in here.

The story is that I've had the same boss for 5 years now, he doesn't know I have social anxiety because I hide it THAT well. What that means is that when I hold back my feelings,he might take me as ""cold"". When I use attack as defense in social situations he may take it as arrogance. But we have worked together for years and he's a good guy,even if being a boss isn't his favorite thing.

Recently his mom died,suddenly. Now he's older than me but our moms are the same age. He naturally took it hard. I struggle talking about it, not even managing to ask him about how it's going when he's back at work, eventhough I was thinking about it. It felt a bit bad.

Funeral came up. It felt a bit odd to go as I hadn't met her,but people were going and it felt right to support him. 

It was a touching funeral where we got to know her a bit as well,then we walked to the burial place and observed a minute silence. After we were queuing to say our condolances I went up to give my boss a hug. The surprise and joy he showed when he saw me made me both happy and sad. Happy because it was good to see it meant much to him, sad because it shouldn't have to be such a great surprise that I came.

It was a kick in the ass about putting myself on the line more and following my instincts even if my other instincts want me to say nothing to spare me judgement and ridicule. So to the original question,why? Because there's people that care for you, and people make life good. If the ones around you now don't you need to get up and find someone that does.

My mother has been going to a gym for the past two years and has been very satisfied with the progress she's made. She has been inviting me to go with her for a long time. This morning, I finally went. I was looking forward to working out, until I got there. There were so many cars in the parking lot. In the mornings the gym has a group workout class in a back room. That's where most of the people were, but there were 5-6 people in the main gym part. The gym was an old car dealership, and the main part was just one big open room with lots of equipment. People were spaced out pretty evenly throughout the gym, and when I saw all of them I started getting nervous. My mom went to the back room and told the coach that she had brought me as a guest. While she did this, I slipped out the door and went home.

I couldn't do it. I should have known I was unable to do it, as I have a hard enough time going for a walk outside, much less, using exercise equipment. I really wish I was able to enjoy working out in a room full of people, because it's hard to motivate myself to exercise at home. If I lived on my own, I would have no problem with buying my own equipment so I would not have to worry about that, but I have many years of college ahead of me before I will reach that point.

Not that I'm being pessimistic, but SA has wrecked my life. The worst part is, I look back through the years and realize how it subtly influenced me and I didn't even realize it. 

I think it's great if people get better, but I'm looking for complete removal of social anxiety. I think the whole ""anxiety is a part of life"" thing is just a cop out because some therapist really don't know how to fix social anxiety. Anxiety around people isn't normal. Maybe a little nervousness, but full blown anxiety is just an overreaction to a situation that other individuals don't even sweat. My goal is complete removal of this ridiculous behavior, not coping with it. 

I went to a hypnotherapist recently to see if that would help and it was a mild success. She recommended I start writing an e-book about my experience with SA and what I've done to move past it. She said I should sell it on the amazon marketplace in response to my lack of a job at the moment as a way to make some money. I think it was part of her tactic to make me feel like I'm moving past the anxiety and stepping into a new chapter of my life.  

Two things I thought of. 1. While my anxiety has gotten better over the years, I'm not cured. I'd feel like a hypocrite writing a book about something I still suck at dealing with. 2. I've always been a firm believer in helping people for free and not capitalizing on others suffering. Nobody wants to buy a book and feel like it was just a way to make money off of them. I generally hate self help for this reason, it's filled with stuff that people love to hear but never really solves anything and the author just profits.

My best friend suffers from social anxiety, and I'm wondering what I can do to help him. He's really clever, witty, and fun to bring around, but is quite worried (I assume) about what others think of him. I often invite him out to hang out with me and some friends, and he usually declines. I don't pressure him to hang out when he doesn't want to, because I don't want him to feel worse than he otherwise already does, but I do worry about him. Besides myself he doesn't have many friends, and he usually just works, plays games, and spends time with his younger sister.

As a kind of aside, I suffered from pretty debilitating social anxiety in my teens, but I grew out of it and quite frankly, just stopped giving a shit what people think about me... I remember getting quite frustrated when people would try to get me to ""come out of my shell"", so I guess I'm looking for advice or things I can try that won't make my friend feel angry or uncomfortable.

Today I went to the post office to send a something abroad. I thought they would see it, since there was the address with the destination on it. But they put the wrong stamps on it, not noticing it. I had already paid when I saw it. So I told them that it wasn't right and if they hadn't seen it. I was given an annoyed look and a ""I can't look at every single address here!"".
There were two people in line behind me who seemed stressed and to be in a hurry. 
I paid again and left. I felt horrible. When I got home I started shaking, broke down and cried. 

This is just one of these situations that I have experienced since I went to high school. I have always been that shy girl that never raised her hand or talked. And if so, only with her few friends. When someone criticises me I could either punch them or cry. I'm going to college now, not knowing anybody. I haven't attended classes for 3 weeks. 

So the point of this is that today I feel like I really need help. I've never talked to anyone about my problems. Everybody just thinks that I'm shy. I looked up possibilities in my city and found a therapist who is specialised in social anxiety and a support group just a few houses down the street. The problem with the therapist is that I would have to call for an appointment, which is a hard thing to do for me. The support group can be joined via e-mail conversation but it doesn't really make sense to me to join a group of people since I can't stand being around people. Any thoughts?

This particular example goes like this: I'm new at my university. I'm reading between classes in a hallway. A group of people gather near me and are talking/joking around. They end up standing really close to where I'm sitting, so that it feels kind of awkward that I'm so close but not a part of their group/situation. Eventually they notice that I'm quiet/don't look at them or seem to notice them. So they start doing weird things to get my attention, like dancing or singing something to get me to look. 

What do I do in this situation? Should I say something? If so, what? The only things I've tried are: keep pretending they aren't there and don't look up from what I'm doing. The other thing I've tried is awkwardly looking at them and forcing a smile, before going back to my reading.

Now about the hair. She showed me a couple of photos of what I should get and I went to the hairdressers. The next day at school, I got noticed by lots of people, and started chatting with a lot of them. Some girls even came up to me to tell me how much they like my new haircut.

This was an amazing feeling, to be noticed. I feel like I gained so much confidence from this alone.

The best part about this, is that I met a girl who I really liked and who later on said that she was into me. I really hope this leads to something.

Hope you understand why.

So, I'll start by saying I'm sixteen years old living in Australia and stopped going to school almost two years ago from now because I just couldn't handle the anxiety. I can only recall being anxious around year 3 and gradually getting worse from then on, so I assume that's when it started but I have no idea of anything that would have caused it. During these two years, I've probably only left my house a couple of times (and now have a Vitamin D deficiency due to this), the only thing I leave my house for is haircuts. Wall of text incoming describing events between when I stopped going to school and now.

After a couple of months of being threatened by police and school liaison officers to go to school or be forcibly taken and taken to court for thousands of dollars (which never happened), I was visited by a family counselor for the rest of the year which honestly didn't help, though he did help me work up the courage to visit a hospital and get blood tests for the medication I'd later take (Paroxetine).

After three months of taking Paroxetine, I still felt no different in regards to my anxiety (though the side effects were apparent) which was when I stopped taking them as I had no more refills (and couldn't get myself to go back to the hospital). With the medication not working and the family counselor no longer checking up on me, I felt like there was nothing I could do. I started getting depressed and kept having visions of friends moving on and me staying inside this house which, of course, made me even more depressed. To make matters worse, the school liaison officer once again started to make threats to my mother about being taken to court. She was convinced I was faking the entire thing.

After that, there isn't much else to say. I've been sitting in my house for almost two years now and I haven't accomplished anything. I used to have friends (and probably still do) but I haven't been in contact with them at all. I tried to get an education outside of school through home schooling/distance education but for some reason I'm not allowed to because I have to meet some sort of criteria (?).  I can't look people in the eye, my entire face twitches when I try talking to someone, and stutter slightly when I'm nervous. It feels like my brain has a good and bad side with one side telling me to get over the anxiety and the other telling me all the horrible things that will happen if I step outside that door. When I'm trying to sleep, it my brain goes into overdrive and suddenly I get the motivation to walk out the door but when I wake up the motivation is gone and anxiety has taken its place.

I'm wasting my teenage years and missing out on so much. I want to be able to walk out of my house without worrying what someone has to think about me. What do I do?

She told me a couple of weeks ago that she wanted me to attend the after-party with her, and I sarcastically replied that I would, because I loved meeting new people.  

 Well, tonight she held me to it, and although I did not really want to go, I bit the bullet and decided to go through with my promise.  Nothing huge happened, except that my formerly crushing fear of socializing with strangers was mostly gone.  The party was at a local tavern with a live band and was extremely crowded and loud.  Definitely not my type of place.  But I found her, and stuck around for about thirty minutes before taking off, as promised.  

 The only real awkward time for me was when she and her friends got out on the dance floor, and I was left standing in the corner like a doofus.  That was not so much a function of my social anxiety though, as it was of being a middle class white guy with absolutely no idea how to rock my body out on the dance floor.  

 The best moment of the whole night, and maybe the whole month, was meeting one of her hot friends, and getting her laughing within thirty seconds with a couple of jokes and some small talk.  On my way out the door later on I said goodbye to the girl, and she leaned in and touched my elbow and told me that it was really nice to meet me, in a very genuine fashion, not just out of politeness.  Flirting with an attractive girl the first time I meet her, and having her respond positively, is pretty goddamned amazing for me, and possibly a lifetime first.  It felt good.

I've been increasingly obsessing over killing myself for the past week, and I don't think I can talk myself out of it anymore. I feel like I'm completely alone, and for many years I have literally been completely alone. I've lived without making a single relationship with another person for my entire adult life. This is not because I enjoy being alone. It's because I don't know how to trust people. I've always had difficulty trusting other people, but I'm worse about that now than I ever have been. I leave my home only to get food (I'm unemployed for the past year), and I do so in such a way that I minimize my proximity to other people and entirely avoid any actual interaction. The only contact I have is occasionally with my parents, and I'm less comfortable talking even to them all the time. I have nobody that I can be honest about myself with. 

I feel hopeless and there's nobody for me to go to for help. I've tried telling my parents that I can't talk to people, but they don't understand that it's not just something I don't care for or am a bit uncomfortable with. They tell me, ""just get over it!"", ""once you do it, you'll see it's not so bad!"". This makes me feel so much worse because it shows how much people don't believe it's more than me being picky and refusing to do something because I don't feel like it. I had been making some progress for a while, with a lot of help from a therapist. Unfortunately, it's difficult to see much of him and lately I've been getting much worse and more isolated. 

Now I'm at a point where I'm going to be homeless and broke, and I don't see why I should continue this downward spiral that is my life. I don't want to give up, so I did something that was very difficult and put my trust in someone I've been trying very hard to believe has changed. He's betrayed me in the past, in fact one of the most hurtful betrayals of my life. A great deal of my persistant fear that nobody can be trusted stems from what he did to me. Despite that, I wanted to believe he had changed, and the thought that I could made me think I might be able to change how I feel about other people. I was wrong to trust him though. Sure, he has changed in many ways, and I'm glad for him that he was able to care more about himself, but he doesn't care any more about me than he ever did. To him, ""helping"" me is really all about him building himself up by tearing me down. He did nothing but berate and insult me, shouting violently, and I'm ashamed to admit that it's very easy for someone to hurt me deeply, especially someone I care about and trust. I'm even more ashamed that I was too paralyzed with fear to even try to defend myself. All of the pain from what happened in the past came back. Now I feel more shut off from people than ever. 

I have a week before I have no home, no food, and no money. I have nobody to even talk to about this. I've only ever been a burden and a disappointment to anyone so it's no wonder there is nobody in my life. I know it's said that suicide is always the wrong choice, yet it happens all the time. I can't convince myself that it isn't the best choice I have. Would it be better for anyone if I waited to die alone in the street? I know people will say I'm being ridiculous. Of course those aren't my only choices. Of course I can just get over my problems. I'm just lazy of selfish for wanting to give up. I'm not defending myself or my actions.

I'm 21 and I have always found being alone relaxing and calming, I've at this point in my life pretty much accepted that I'm kinda an introvert. Being around a lot of people doesn't bother me really though, except if I know them and I'm expected to interact. 

A good example happened two nights ago, I was feeling a little lonely so I called a friend up, figured I'd go over to his place, just sit around and talk, you know, low-key stuff.

He informs me that he's actually on his way to the bar, so I tell him to have a nice night and I'm ready to hang up when he invites me to come with him. I instantly feel my stomach tighten, ""Er.. well, uh, whose driving?"" I ask, as the bar isn't near his home. He informs me that 8 other people will be going, and I feel insanely uncomfortable. I tell him I'll just stay home, and to have a nice night, and I hang up without waiting for a response.

I have this feeling that I've had Social Anxiety and have just been ""ignoring"" it most of my life, I force myself into social situations constantly, parties, drinking, etc. I never enjoy them, but it's what other people do, so I do it.

At the same time, if I have a few close friends over for a boardgame or something, I feel relaxed, mostly. I also have this crazy paranoia that anything I say or do will set off the people I'm with.

Another thing that has been constant is the ordering of food. I always feel like if I don't do it correctly or fast enough the person taking my order will get pissed and refuse to serve me. I hate ordering food, and I'll never send food back, because I'm scared the waiter/waitress will yell at me.


Despite all this, I've managed to act 'normal' and just be extremely uncomfortable all the time. Do these sound like the symptoms of social anxiety to you guys? If they do, what should I do now?

Completely justified guilt trip aside, I'm in a pretty deep downward spiral now, because of the reminder of how often this sort of thing happens. I keep telling my parents that they can't expect things to get done if they allocate the scheduling and communication aspects of planning to me, but I still take on those responsibilities because I can't bring myself to refuse. I can't link to it on my phone, but the always popular ""This is Why I'll Never Be an Adult"" post on Hyperbole and a Half describes the self-perpetuating anxiety regarding communication (specifically email in that case) fairly well.

I don't want to keep asking for help in these things because I'm 21 and I should have some level of competence by now, but I always panic and never get important messages sent. I never got my dog's meds, I can't refill my OWN prescriptions, I missed the best time to sign up for college courses because I didn't contact my advisor so I have a crappy schedule this semester, I don't return calls to my friends, I have an overdue parking ticket, you get the idea.

And don't even get me started on doing any of this via phone instead of email. It won't happen. Unless my mom is sitting right next to me for moral support, these phone calls DO NOT GET MADE. It sucks. It makes my life so much harder than it needs to be, but I can't make it stop.

I don't know why I'm even posting this. I don't really expect much help. I guess I just needed to vent after getting chewed out by my dog-loving aunt and uncle for being a bad owner.

Mon-Thurs I work at the corporate fitness center, and Friday I work at the one downtown, which is historical and is used more by retirees.

The 'big boss' works downtown, and today she came up here to work out. She told me that several people at the downtown fitness center have complained that I'm not friendly, and proceeded to instruct me on saying 'hi, how are you' to people when they come in, as if I'm mentally challenged or something, making me almost start crying.

Generally, people come in, swipe their badges to get credit, say ""hi"" to me, and walk on by. Downtown the check-in desk is in a weird hallway, and Idunno, with social anxiety, I can't get a good 'rhythm' of saying 'hi' to some people when they check-in. Like, they say a terse 'hi' and I look up from the computer and smile to say hi, but then they are gone. I always feel like I have to clear my throat before I can respond, and before I've even finished clearing it, they are gone. 

What really upsets me is this only happens with a few people, maybe 5 or 6, mostly older women. The older men are friendly and take their time, and I can say hi and even make a little small talk with them and be 'friendly'. But these older women, I feel like they give me a 3-second window to respond to them and if I don't, they walk away and then complain that I'm 'unfriendly'.

I know I should make more of an effort to be a better receptionist, and I will try. The thing that is ruining my day about this right now, of course, is that it just feels so unfair. I have a good relationship with many of the patrons of the fitness center, and I would say the majority of the time people are mostly satisfied with my friendliness (I'm not much for the small-talk, but I think I'm doing good at making my 'hi's and 'hi how are you's' a nice friendly, warm, welcoming tone, and stuff). 

**TL;DR** I'm just angry and upset that because of a few people who *aren't very friendly themselves* decided to complain to my boss, she thinks that I'm not friendly and a bad receptionist.

1343020154.0,26,self.socialanxiety,x02vh,Today I had a complete panic attack for such a small reason. I decided once and for all I have no choice but to seek professional help.,,28,2,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/x02vh/today_i_had_a_complete_panic_attack_for_such_a/,"One of my worst days in high school: my ""best friend,"" for some reason, decided to sic one of her other friends on me. That friend came up to me at lunch and said, ""Your purse is ugly."" Not knowing how to react, I laughed and said, ""Thank you!"" trying to play it off as a joke. She said it again and I just ignored her until she walked away. Later that day, in the class we all shared, I sat next to them and they spent the entire period loudly talking about me (""I was being serious. Her purse really is ugly,"" ""Haha, I know, it's so lame. I can't believe she said thank you,"") until I just left and sobbed in the bathroom.

Having social anxiety in high school was bad enough, but stuff like this was so awful. I just grew more and more sensitive to it and now I just ... flip out whenever I feel like somebody is being slightly mean to me. I seem to be unable to control it.

Fast-forward to today.

I stupidly responded to a distant friend's semi-controversial post having to do with the Batman shooting. She's always been easy to talk to, so I figured me disagreeing with her wouldn't cause a problem. We've always been able to discuss things calmly. We share almost no political beliefs, discuss our disagreements a lot, but have *never* fought about them.

Not this time. Within a few posts, she'd made it clear she wasn't taking anything I said seriously (she seemed to misunderstand what I was saying, as well) and immediately created a new status and proceeded to rant about me. She didn't say my name, but she said she didn't understand ""some people's"" opinions (describing mine), and how disgusting and offensive she thought they were. Many of her friends joined in, insulting my stance; they all ""liked"" each other's comments about how absurd my opinion (on the post directly below) was -- people I didn't even know. They had all joined in this little party of making fun of my position, just moments after I'd been talking with her. I was clearly online and could've answered any questions she had, but she decided to do that instead. I was shocked, but tried to keep my cool and I just didn't respond and attempted to let it go.

That didn't last. I just got angrier and more hurt throughout the day until I had a complete mental breakdown the next morning (this morning). **I flipped out beyond all rationality**. I was so angry and hurt and embarrassed. I felt singled out and betrayed by someone I thought was a friend. It reminded me of high school, of being expected to listen to people insult me, knowing I can hear them, without being able to join in. I had a complete panic attack, and truly, for the first time in so long, felt like I couldn't imagine continuing to live in this world. My sweet husband calmed me down.

And now I feel like such an idiot. This was such a small thing -- a mere disagreement -- and it nearly *destroyed* me. I deleted her, and everyone else that wasn't family or a best friend, from my Facebook because I felt like all my interactions with them were fake and stupid and none of them cared about me anyway. I sent her an incoherent message before doing this that caused her to tell my mom I was suicidal, and my mom panicked until she could reach me. I feel like an idiot, like she's gossiping about me now, like I'm a huge stupid baby for not being able to just take something so small like that in stride. I'm so stupid with this stuff -- even when strangers on Reddit say something mean to me, I get so upset. I know I shouldn't, but I usually can't think of anything else for hours. I don't understand why even the smallest rejection or mishap amongst others sends me into a crying mess and makes me feel so utterly rejected by humanity.

I don't think this is a sustainable way to go through life. I can't protect myself from stuff like this; I won't be able to do anything if this is all it takes to send me into one of the worst panic attacks I've ever had.

(long story)",gml92,28,4,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/ptf0a/most_days_i_feel_like_im_letting_my_life_pass_me/,"Hey everyone, this is my first post to this community. I'm a 22 year old female currently in my last semester at college. I have been dealing with social anxiety issues since I was a little kid (though never actually officially diagnosed with social anxiety) and I've always been shy and introverted. I have very few friends and I've always found it very hard to put myself out there and make friends. I remember being so anxious in grade school about my hair looking stupid that I always wore it up. I've always felt this need to hide myself because I never felt confident enough in who I was (and still don't, really).
And recently I've been going through ups and downs emotionally trying to deal with my issues and until pretty recently I thought I was starting to feel better. I really started having problems when I went away to college. I thought going to a new city 3 hours away from my home would be a good way to get a fresh start from high school.  Part of me knew that high school for most people is definitely a confusing time but coupled with transferring schools at the end of my sophomore year of high school and already having trouble making friends it seemed to feel a lot harder than it should. 

So, I thought I had made it out. And for a few months things were going alright. I was slowly making friends but then my roommate at the time broke up with a guy we were all friends with and I lost contact with him and the friends I had made through him. In retrospect I know that I pushed them away and I could have stayed friends with them but my m.o. is that as soon as I start to get close with someone I back off because I am so afraid of them knowing the real me and not liking me that I feel more comfortable breaking off all communication. So that put me into a spiral and I was having panic attacks, I couldn't sleep, I was crying all the time. I finally saw a counselor on my campus towards the end of my second semester and I was feeling better talking about my problems. However, I ultimately felt so overwhelmed that I transferred and I haven't spoken to any therapist or psychiatrist since. I was also really embarrassed that I had left my school and was so afraid of people asking me why I left. I told everyone it was a money issue (which was partially true). But still, since transferring 4 years ago I can't say that I have really made one friend at my school. I have tried to strike up a a handful of relationships but they always ending up going nowhere because I was too afraid of rejection. I lived in the dorms for 2 years even and I didn't make any real connections. 

The one thing that is constant in my life though has been my sister and my boyfriend. Without them I don't really know what I would have but I'm at the point where I need to be able to do things on my own. I am graduating college and applying to grad programs soon. I am tired of being person every calls the ""quiet"" girl, or being told that I look aloof or indifferent when really I am intimidated and scared. I want to be able to speak my voice, be heard and not be afraid of what everyone else thinks about that. I want to be proud of myself and be confident. 

I am at a dead end emotionally and I don't know what the next move is. I want to make new friends and lasting connections with people. I don't want to sit back and just let my life pass me by. 

I know my story isn't the worst case of social anixety ever but I'm sure everyone who reads and comments in this subreddit can relate to some of the things I have gone through. I am just looking for some helpful advice and even stories of your own hardships and what you are doing or did to overcome them.

I'm not shy, but I'm very introverted and I lose energy when I'm around people.
I need to do things like make phone calls, prepare food for myself, and search for jobs in order to get out of this situation. But I feel too uncomfortable.
This may have to do with the fact that when I lived with my parents, my mom constantly critiqued everyday activities such as dishwashing, laundry, and cooking. When I was living with my parents, I would either desperately try to do these activities while she wasn't home, or procrastinate on doing them indefinitely. Between my mom's micromanaging (probably untreated OCD), my dad's abusive words, and my untreated PMDD, I couldn't handle it and I would often ""snap"" and act out at them. They responded by throwing me out.

I would likeshare some of my experiences, tips. 

Psychiatrist is the most important person to seek help. He knows more than any other what you feel, your limitations and frustrations. His opinions and his advices is that you should consider as most important. Avoid seeking help those who do not understand the subject. Social anxiety can have neurological and genetic causes that ordinary people do not know / do not have to study to understand.

I learned many important things during the course of my life. The first is that you should not force social situations without being ready for it. This may complicate the picture and make you even more isolating. Recognize that you have a disease and must be treated. The longer you delay, the more pain you will have.

If you have a good relationship with your family, you should consider them as the most important people in your life. Your family should talk with a psychiatrist and understand what is going on with you. If things are too complicated with your family always ask for help to the psychiatrist and he will know how to proceed.

Understand that some things in this world as having friends and relationships are not suitable for you. The sooner you accept this, the less will suffer. Trying to get something you can not afford to carry on will only bring suffering and frustration.

Tell people the truth. If they ask you why you do not engage in relationships or have no friends, tell them you have social anxiety disorder, a mental illness that you treat the problem with a psychiatrist. Explain what you have to people can save you from  disturbances they can bring to you.

Look for occupation. Not necessarily get a job, but engaging in activities that can relieve the symptoms and feel better throughout the day. Arts, literature or even video games can help you. If you necessarily need to work but is unable to handle it the psychiatrist know what to do.

Do not put people on pedestals. People are people and have different approach about life. Do not fall in inferiority complex and keep in mind that nobody is better than anyone, some just have limitations.

If you live alone, do not despair. There is always something you can do and your psychiatrist can provide you the means to do so.

Being sad is one thing. Staying sad is another. Understand that you can overcome the sadness with activities or simply watch what you like on TV.

If you can work, but it brings great stress, try another job. You can aways find a better work suitable to you. 

Life is a precious thing. You can enjoy life with different things, like good food, wine and travel (even yourself). 

Philosophy can help you a lot. Engage in reading philosophy books because they can show things in a different sense of life and offer insights that can help you understand that not everything you think is necessarily true. Even if you do not have mainstream opinions. Philosophers who helped me are Socrates, Schopenhauer and Louis Lavelle. There are many other good ones that fit your vision of things and we can help you further, as Nietzsche.

And most importantly: there are people in far worse situations than yours. The world is not just what's around you, and suffering reaches more people than you think.

Skulking is one thing that I'm really exceptional. In the class, if I know the answers, I won't raise my hand. In a conversation, if I have a witty remark, this voice rattles madly; telling me I will trip over my words and make a fool of myself. Blurting out stupid, funny shit isn't just the way I roll. I will think it over and over until it's too late and the group has moved on.

It's not like I have given up -- it's a constant, however, failing battle. Just today, I finally managed to muster up some courage to approach this girl -- not for a relationship, just to prove myself I can do it -- but it was horrible. She completely brushed me off like I'm nothing. I said to myself it's okay and went on to a group of people who had been conversing near by. It wasn't a pleasant either. I then gave up and went home.

I know I suffer from a bad social anxiety and possibly depression, there's no denying that -- however I look at it. I have managed to partly convince myself that I was wired that way, a introvert with an abundance of reticence, and there's nothing I can do to change that. That it's okay for me to be the way I am.

This entire semester, there's been this very pretty, shy, short haired blonde girl in my social psychology class that I've wanted to talk to. She's always with a pair of similarly quiet friends, so I never felt quite comfortable just sitting next to her and striking up a conversation. Several times during the semester, I've had a chance to chat with her, but my social anxiety has always stopped me.

We were once even the last two to leave a test, and I held the door open for her on the way out. She thanked me and smiled, but my social anxiety placed a muzzle on me, not letting me engage her further before she walked away.

Anyway, we had our final today, and I left the room and dawdled outside the building for a bit, futzing around on my phone for a bit. The next thing I know, adorable blonde pixie walks by me, and I want nothing more than to say, ""Hey!"" and engage her with a banal comment about the class before actually talking to her and getting her number.

Although I'm not totally confident I would've had any success talking to this girl, my social anxiety began to strangle me, not letting me say a word to this girl as she walked away, totally unaware of the struggle I was having. I (admittedly creepily) walked after her, wondering if she would stop at a dining hall or something where I could find an excuse to chat her up. Anyway, the conclusion of this is that no, she was off to somewhere else, it began to rain, and I was literally in a sad scene from a movie, down on myself, crippled by social anxiety again.

I realize this sounds obsessive, frankly kinda creepy, and for all sedditors out there, like a case of one-itis, but all I needed was a place to confess how disappointed I am in myself. This happens all to often, and probably explains why I don't have a girlfriend at the moment.

They know to some extent, but I don't really talk about my problems.

Anyway I've been trying to get a job and my dad doesn't understand why I feel it's so difficult to get one. He tells me I'm very good socially and really easy to talk to, so I shouldn't worry about this stuff. That's the thing, I look fine from the outside.

Even when I tell other people I have social anxiety they say it doesn't show. I mean it's cool that nobody else sees it.

It's all an illusion and I feel like my parents think I'm more together than I actually am.

So yeah I'm just wondering how many others struggle with this.

Having a tough time making new friendships too.,rgld,28,3,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/yhm3c/lost_pretty_much_every_friend_i_used_to_have/,"This trend developed the moment I went to college. All my friends from secondary school dropped out after one term, so I was on my own. I didn't make any new friends in two years I spent there and I would go weeks without saying anything to anybody. I did terribly in my final exams and ended up alone and in pieces. That's when I was diagnosed with social anxiety. I pissed a year away after college, spending the large majority of it playing games and going out with the few friends I had left. Things started to get better and I managed to get a place at a fairly bad university, which happened to be the same one two of my friends were going to.

First few weeks at university were good. I made a few friends and spent a large majority of my time socialising. Most people seemed to like me and I found myself a wonderful girlfriend, who I'm still with today. Months past and new friendships faded. My girlfriend I continued to become closer and I spent the whole of summer at her parents house. I occasionally met up with friends when I visited home and invited a few of them down to go out to a bar in town.

Since then, I moved in with my two friends at university and things began going downhill. I noticed how messy, selfish and inconsiderate one of my friends was and the other drank himself stupid every night making outrageous amounts of noise late into the night... Every night. I grew tired and frustrated of them, but tried to remain civil and generous. Getting money off them for bills was a mission and a half, causing me to fall out with one of them towards the end of the year. I sent a fairly stern but fair text, which got no response.

Since then, he turned the majority of my existing friends against me (sounds like high school drama) and has continually invited everyone I know to events and get-togethers, leaving me out (of course). It's been a few weeks since I sent the text to him. I've tried to invite people out, but they don't reply or decline. I've been calling and texting people, but I'm getting to the point now where I'm beginning to doubt whether these people are friends worth having.

I don't think I'm an ass hole. I'm kind and considerate to everyone I meet, I buy people things and expect nothing in return. I bend over backwards to accommodate people's feelings but I never get anything back. I have difficulty finding people I like as most people tend to bore me and have interests extremely different to mine. I also don't think my social anxiety is to blame. I'm fairly confident around new people, far more so than I was before. I've recently been diagnosed with ADHD, but I haven't noticed any difference in my behavior (low dosage at the moment).

I guess what I'm trying to say is:
1) How would I go about finding what it is about me that others dislike?
2) How can I be generous without continually being used?
3) Am what I feeling symptoms of social anxiety returning?
4) Is there anything I can do to make friendships more easily?

Short summary about me:

I'm a guy, and I'll be turning 26 in September. I'm unemployed, and live at home. My problems with SA and depression started around the beginning of high school, and since then I've had no friends, and no social life to speak of. I've been trying self-help CBT books for over a year, and a few months ago I attended a group therapy program for the SA. 

I've made some progress, for example, I'll be going back to school in a few months. 

However, the wall I'm running up against now is that I feel like I simply am never on the same wavelength as other people near my age. I feel like I'm too serious and don't know how to be lighthearted, enthusiastic, spontaneous, willing to be silly, etc. I just can't make myself have these qualities. Humour is a social lubricant, right? But I just don't have what it takes to be funny or interesting. I feel like no amount of exposures can cure that problem for me. 

For example, I play TF2, and I prefer servers where there are a lot of people talking. The best servers have lots of people who are funny and interesting. 

My problem is that I simply don't have the capacity to generate even one interesting sentence, but I want desperately to fit in and make friends. How do they do this so effortlessly? 

If I try speaking, I very quickly start to feel an intense social pain, as though I'm already being harshly rejected by everyone. My mind interprets every silence and ambiguity as confirmation that everyone hates me and want's me to shut up. I just lose all energy and feel the same sense of ""shutting down"" that i can remember feeling in those first years of highschool. 

Can anyone relate to this? I feel incredibly hopeless about this. Exposure can reduce the anxiety I feel, but how am I supposed to deal with this overwhelming pain? How am I supposed to connect with anyone when all my brain is telling me is ""they don't like you, you have nothing of value to offer [etc]""?

The CBT techniques don't seem to work for this. I'm not sure what to do. I've never felt close to anyone in my life. It's driving me crazy. I want to grow up and and move on, but this sense of pain that comes from just being around other people is as strong as it ever was. 



Not necessarily looking for advice, but I want to know if this is something that others can relate to. Is there a way to break through this barrier? Is taking MDMA the only chance I have? I feel desperate for a solution.

Anyway, I’ve suffered from social anxiety for a few years now. My S.A gets particularly worse around guys that I find attractive, so I often cope by avoiding what scares me. Ex. if an attractive guy enters the room, I'll go out of my way not to make eye contact with him. Instead, I’ll just steal a glance or two, and do nothing.

Guys don’t really approach me either – I know it’s not my looks since guys and girls have said I'm really pretty/cute). Most guys just stare, but they’ll end up thinking I’m not interested since I have trouble making eye contact with them, and I just can’t smile at guys I like. Basically, I'm pretty quiet/shy unless ppl speak to me first, and then I'll be friendly although nervous. It isn’t intentional, but if a guy doesn’t talk to me first, I won’t show interest at all. (Mostly because I don’t know how) But also because I’d prefer a guy think I’m a little cold/distant than risk trying to flirt with him, and revealing myself to be really shy, inexperienced and socially inept. :(

To get straight to the point, I’m a lonely single who’s getting older and I just want to experience dating and relationships while I’m still in my 20’s. My biggest issue is that my anxiety prevents me from making the initial connection - I unintentionally avoid/push away people I find myself attracted to. Guys assume I don’t like them when I do this, not “she’s just nervous,” which sucks for me.

How do I get guys I like to know that I am interested in them, but that I have a tendency to give off signals that suggest the opposite because of my social anxiety?

As a result, I've made two very good friends who I've been working with for about a year now.

They are consistently wanting to hang out on the weekends or after work (all three of us, which makes me even more nervous...), and thus far I've been making a lot of excuses and haven't gone. I keep myself pretty secluded on the weekends - mostly just hanging out with my boyfriend, who I live with, and maybe one other friend on occasion. I honestly like it this way. But the coworkers are amazing people, and I can tell it's starting to put them off that I keep declining their invitations.

Honestly, I'm fine with keeping the friendship mostly at work and not taking it further (although I love both of them.) Being around people makes me a nervous wreck, and I haven't had many close friends since early college (so maybe 6 years ago.) I did, at one point, have several but have slowly shut them out due to anxiety and the other issues surrounding my anxiety. 

I realize having friends is healthy... but it feels like more trouble than it's worth when I'm fine with the level of interaction we currently have. Should I suck it up and hang out with them, or keep declining? If I keep declining, how honestly should I address why I don't want to hang out?

(Probably not worth your time to read.),paraliesd,28,4,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/tkd8t/i_was_told_i_should_crosspost_this_here_i_feel/,"I'm sorry if this post is kind of broken. I've never been any good at talking about things like this, and even though my normal account is unique to reddit I made this throwaway so that if what I fear happens and everyone hates me and this post I won't have to live with it. My problems are so pathetic compared to what other people have to go through, I feel guilty talking about it.

Ever since I was old enough to care about how our society and culture expects me to act, I've been living a lie. I've pretended to not like things I do like and have hid my feelings because I didn't want to seem weird. All throughout school I was quiet. Most kids get over their shyness a few grades in, but I never did. I was fine with talking to what few friends I had, but for the most part I was silent, wishing I could be somewhere else. I was paranoid, too. I always felt like people were making fun of me, even if they never really seemed to. I was always suspicious of it if a ""popular"" kid talked to me, even if it did seem like maybe they were just trying to be nice. 

At home, my interests are mostly hidden. The only time I read, watch, or listen to what I want is when nobody else is around or awake. I hide my enjoyment of anime, My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, any music that isn't 40+ years old, and anything else I feel I could be teased about. My family has always been quick to tease, and it's always deeply hurt me, even if it shouldn't. They don't mean it in meanness, but I've never been able to handle it. I was too embarrassed to develop a stronger friendship with one girl because my family would tease me about it, and after that I kept almost all of my friendships hidden. As a result, I've never seen most of my friends outside of school.

I'm just so abnormal. 17 year old guys are supposed to like cars, but I know nothing about them. They're supposed to be semi-obsessed with sex, but I'm [asexual](http://www.asexuality.org/home/). They're supposed to dislike romantic plots, but those plots are my favorite part of watching shows like The Office. For one reason or another, I have to hide almost everything about me. I've never wanted to live this way. I want to be able to be who I really am, but I can't. If I ever tried to really just be myself, I don't think anyone would like me. I'd be even more alone than I already am. I can't even tell any of this to anyone on my normal account, and if I so much as try to mention it to my best friend I lock up and can't do anything. It's like I'm physically unable to talk about it. A part of that is probably because I know how stupid and pathetic it all is. How stupid and pathetic *I am*.

I experience a lot of the symptoms I've read about here and at other sources, but not with enough severity for it to be clinically diagnosable (haven't had any panic attacks, for instance). That said, I feel like I can relate to you guys with a lot of my issues.

I think my biggest social problem is that I'm afraid to express my feelings and personality to people. Even with my friends, I get embarrassed really easily and I avoid talking personally about myself because I feel like they'd make fun of me. Even discussing stuff like hobbies or interests can be difficult because when something goes through my head I tend to think ""Nah, that's dumb/boring"" or ""Nobody would care about that"" and don't share it (I swear, ""What did you do this weekend?"" is my most hated question ever.). This problem extends to my family as well as my friends. My one save is that I consider myself a fairly funny person, so when things get too personal about me I just try to spin it into a joke to keep things from getting too uncomfortable. Either way, the end result is I have trouble making conversations with people because I usually end up discarding most of the stuff that pops into my head for the reasons above. The worst thing, though, is that I've had multiple people say that I act like a ""robot"" around them. Others tell me that I ""always look sad"" or ""really bored"" when they approach me or see me around. I remember once I was talking with a couple of people and one made a crack like ""Oh, squarecake's not capable of feeling emotions."" and everyone else laughed and agreed. In context, they weren't trying to be mean, but it hurt because I do have emotions and I do want to be able to share them with people, but my fear of ending up embarrassed or alienated just leads me to feel like I'll never be able to connect with someone beyond just casual chatting.

I'm not sure what I expect to achieve by reaching out, but maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised with the results.

I'm 20 years old. I recently moved to a small town in a new state to live with my boyfriend in a tiny little village of a town. Everyone knows everyone here, and they're all pretty laid back and all seem to enjoy the same activities - mostly outdoor stuff. I'm used to the city life. So that introduces one of my problems: I don't connect with anyone. 

I have a job at a swanky restaurant tending bar. I really enjoy my work. However, even being there for three months now, I've yet to exchange phone numbers or arrange a get-together with anybody. I really believe there is somebody somewhere who might share the same interests as me but I have yet to go as far as even sharing a laugh with a person. They ask me how my day was, and I usually have to lie and pretend that I did something interesting (when in reality I didn't do shit), and I feel like they see through me and must think I'm fake instead of scared. 

I'm obsessed with how others perceive me. If anybody gives me any kind of positive feedback, it's like a silent victory in my head which soon wears off when I don't get any more.

I believe that my social anxiety stems from many problems.

One is my identity crisis. My entire life I've never known what role to play with anybody. I've read psychology books and I believe it comes from having an aggressive domineering mother, and a gay father. Most mothers are nurturing, while fathers are protective and the roles that mine played with me were nontraditional. I also was the youngest of 6 female cousins who were always around. They were so established in who they were that I would look to each one and try to emulate their identities myself but I was never good enough. For example: One cousin was a singer, and if I wanted to sing my family would tell me how cute it was, me acting like her. Or if I got involved in sports, they'd compare me to another cousin. And etc. So by the time I became a teenager I had no idea who the fuck I was or what direction to go in. It made me feel extremely unaccepted and self-conscious. 

So now I'm convinced that no one will ever accept me, or confirm any sort of identity that I've pasted together. On the upside, I now know the inner workings of my brain very very well, after all the years and contemplation on the matter. Still, the anxiety is unbearable, because I know that no matter what I think of myself, no one will ever think the same unless I somehow prove it. That requires aggression, and I'm withdrawn.

Another problem which has intensified my SA is a somewhat PTSD I've acquired from having toxic friends. Being terrified of most people, and unable to connect to them, I tend to only attract people who are unhealthy. And with lots of time on my hands, I use more energy on them than most people would, and they tend to become clingy or manipulative with me. I won't go into too much more detail, but the point is that now I'm always concerned that any friend I make will try to destroy me. 

Someone help me understand what I can do to change this vicious cycle. I'm tired of being the odd one out, too petrified to share the joys of life with anyone.

After all, if you don't think about it negatively, you don't frame it and you just go through it even if it is not pleasurable. Pleasure comes after time... always. We all have been through this - when somewhat interaction is super scary and after it passes, we feel wonderful... free.

So right now I'm just thinking that this is a great a-ha moment I should share. Every time I stopped thinking and instead focused on watching the environment, I started being less scary of it. I am not conciously able to do that yet, but I think that this is the goal I should go for. Why was this effective? Because I stopped thinking how bad do I feel and were in the moment. I used my focus to watch the environment and I did not have time to think of anything bad. This is very similar to meditation, which in fact helps you to be more calm and calmness is not anxiety.

I now know that I should not let myself analyse things in social situations too much. When that happens, I get anxiety.

So, my conclusion is this... Whenever I feel social anxiety - I probably stopped being in the moment a few minutes ago and I should just let it go, relax and not care about anything, because all this is - just a feeling. Feelings, of course, lead to certain results and outcomes (for example, behaving awkwardly), but I think the key here is to become calm and stop thinking.

If you sat next to me in class I probably wouldn't talk to you, I wouldn't introduce myself or initiate any small talk.

Senior year-I deeply feel the need to escape this image of myself and for some of the new people I have met I am outgoing, funny, and confident. 

Problem is when I'm around those old people I used to know when I was shy, I feel like I'm obligated to act the same way as before, and change would be drastic and strange. 

I guess one response to this would be to man up, but there is a level of anxiety I face, maybe the happy, and confident person is just a facade. 

I feel so much better when I can talk to people and make them burst out laughing- it is an exhilarating feeling and I am unable to do it sometimes because of social anxiety.

This past year has been huge for me, partly because I left school to sort out my anxiety (I'm doing great), but also because I've finally come to accept myself as gay.

I've gotten to the point where I am thinking about coming out to my parents (I'm completely closeted) but I don't know how it will affect my SA.
A large part of my anxiety involves worrying about how people perceive me. I like to have control over what people think of me and I'm not sure how identifying openly as gay will change that.
Part of me hopes that coming out will give me a greater sense of freedom to be myself without feeling selfconcious. But another part of me knows that identifying as gay will lead people to make further assumptions about me even though I don't exactly fit the 'gay sterotype'.

So I want to hear your experiences with coming out and how it affected your social anxiety.

I was sitting in class today, being super awkward, when my teacher made a joke and the guy next to me started laughing.

I believe it may have been an attempt to be like ""hey, we both thought that was funny, maybe we could be friends"" kind of look. Maybe I read to deep into it, but I immediately grimaced and tried to focus on the lecture. This is not uncommon for me. Someone who I do not know tries to be friendly to me, and I freeze up. I am extremely uncomfortable with expressing emotions around people, and when a gesture is even slightly intimate, I can not help but panic. 

For me, I see myself spending most of my time alone in the future. When I write it, I can not help but feel like I should be sad about that. But I can not picture myself enjoying life if it is not in solitude. Not extreme solitude. But the kind of solitude where the most fun I have on the weekend is playing a 10 hours of video games. 

However, I can not help but yearn for a relationship with the opposite sex. That is mostly my penis talking, but I do not think I could be happy with out the intimacy of a woman. I am scared of what that means, though. I am not sure.

As I was driving back from class, I began remembering some of my happier times in life. They have always been in the company of those whom I love. This includes family members, and a friend I once had. I have not spoken to these particular people in over a year.

I'm diagnosed as severe social anxiety disorder. I basically grew up like this since I was in early teens like 13 I think. My parents divorced and fought often. My mom was abusive when I was growing up. It was only recently that I sought professional help and I'm now 27.

Zoloft is the medication my doctor prescribed me starting from 50 mg and then to 100, though there is some talk of going higher. Zoloft changed me in that it gave me the ability to function and allowed me to finally manage to work, without coming home feeling like I have this deep hole in my heart and strong desire to be on my own and not be with anyone. I feel a bit more confident and I don't take criticisms and judgements as personally as I once did. That's not to say though that I feel completely ""normal"" to many degrees. Talking to people has always been a challenge for me, because I don't really relate to people at all. I tend to talk about the most mundane thing in the world and find amusement out of it, or talk about things that interests me - which most (normal ""socially adept"") people finds it rather ... peculiar (to say the least). Sure, I meet those guys who are similar in characteristic than I am, but we are still different. They may just be shy and manage work and school fine. Go through as though their only issue is the initial phase of things and once they are calm and comfortable, they can talk about anything. 

Though I take zoloft and I sought therapist for a while, I feel ambivalent to some of the changes and I even feel some resistance like ' I do not want to change;' 'this is who I am, why should I change?' And at the same time, I'm scared to seek help as well as scared to change, and even to actually change to those people who has thousands of friends; have sex with random girls every other night or something; and be able to party. Something tells me that while some of these changes some people go through sounds great but in practice, it's just not something in my character. 

I feel at work, I have placed a facade over my face. I act as a person I'm really not. I become very objective and reasonable and logical, despite those reasoning may be something the supervisor may *not* care to know or much less have the time and patience to go to such extent, but to me it's important. I have realized it's easier to be someone else than to be your real true self. When I revealed my true self to my sister, she didn't take things well. I've taken my time to research and do all the work but when they're unappreciated, I feel upset. But when they are presenting something that irks them, I will attempt to take the length to explain my reasoning and be as objective as possible. But many people at work takes things way too personally for me when I make no ad hominem attacks at them as they so outright do, even directly to my face. And though I am able to withstand most of what they say, it is still not easy. I can put a smile on my face as though I'm happy on the outside, but on the inside - I'm drowning with feelings - and thoughts. Zoloft has helped me feel normal, and able to finally function - at least to finally be able to work on my *own* - but at times, I am perplexed. 

After work, I come home and spend most of my time on the computer, like I have been doing since I was 8. I think I have become socially retarded to the point where I do not know the slangs; the social cues within those slangs; even one with heavy discussion on different drug they sometimes indulges on. I feel what's even more difficult is I hold so much stuff inside. I let it out, and this ranting happens. If I try to discuss somethings with some other people, say at work, I'm not always understood or heard or given the same respect I wish they give to the rest of the other employers. 

School has always been up and down with me. I at times have very strong motivation to learn what's in my interest but they quickly die down as quick as I got them. And I'm pretty much like Charlie Brown, ""watching the days go by"" as I'm watching the clouds on snoopy's house. It appears though that I'm extremely likeable to other people. I can make *friends* quickly at work. And they like me; but I don't feel the same way. In the facade, in the rather complicated thoughts and feeling inside of me, I am very distant from the type of person they think I am - or at least I think so. I am so great at being someone else that I'm too scared to be myself. But it was this that helped me function at work. To change this - now, is like asking me to go naked in public. But I feel Zoloft has only increased the effect of my facade even more. I come home and feel like I am finally back to my sanctuary. But I also do not have anyone to talk to, either. I have absolutely no idea what I do everyday behind my computer, but I'm always here - being distant and lonely. But I feel *this* is who I am, and no matter how often I seek therapist or psychiatrist, I will **never** change; or perhaps I am resistant to, I don't know. :\",,False,,t5_2r22n,False,,,True,t3_wsytz,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/wsytz/outcome_of_growing_up_with_sad_long_and_rant_i/,

I almost talked myself out of going again last night, but I told myself earlier on in the day that I was going and the more I told myself that the more it was easier to digest (possibly due in part to an inherent stubbornness I have) and eventually that snowballed into excitement. I went and it was wonderful! I met so many interesting and passionate people and it was beyond relieving to be surrounded my like-minded individuals who care about the same things and who didn't think my ideas were so outrageous.

Everything is happening so quickly, I start on Monday and I only just found out about the job on Thursday.

A lot of days I will sit on the bus, or walk around, or even with close friends and obsess over my face and particularly, whether or not I am smiling. It causes physical tension in the muscles of my mouth and cheeks, and amplifies my anxiety attacks even more. If I can fix this problem, my anxiety will basically go away as I've nailed most other aspects of it.

My greatest fear is that if I walk around with my neutral face, my mouth will drop into a frown or pissed off look, and I'm worried that people will find me unapproachable or unfriendly. I am the exact opposite though, so it's really infuriating and getting unbearable. 

It's basically stemming from physical insecurities, which I KNOW are all in my head but I can't seem to convince my face to relax no matter what I think in the moment. My cheek muscles and mouth all tense up and no matter what I think or do I can not get them to relax. Walking around smiling makes it just as bad, because I have to hold it and that gets really tiring. I just sit with my face all tight thinking ""shit what if people see that im unhappy or maybe they think I want to start a fight with them"" etc etc. usual anxiety thoughts which make the cycle worse and worse.

Does anyone experience the same thing or know some way to get over this type of face tension? It's crippling me really badly, considering that I can talk to most people just fine, but tensing up makes it really damn difficult (and it makes others feel a little awkward). 

I'm not on meds, haven't ever been on them, and haven't ever seen a psychiatrist. But I am thinking this may be the only option left. I've tried self-CBT, positive thinking, meditation, I workout 4 days a week, eat healthy, take vitamins of all sorts (B vitamins on top of multi and fish oils) but these don't help with this particular physical symptom.

High school was ok for me, it was not a bad time. I had a lot of friends, I was a social butterfly interacting with everything and everyone. Everyone thought I was a good guy, but I never really got to know people so I never actually belonged in a group. I think I can call myself a floater. 
There was one person in particular where I was very good friends with, I knew him since first grade. He ditched me for a set of different people, I tried to be part of the group but I always felt I wasn’t ‘cool’ enough for them. I also skateboarded a lot with a bunch of people. We had a good time, but there was one person which I didn’t like at all. He knew I was insecure about myself and used this, by teasing me and putting me down. This went so far that I decided to not skateboard anymore. I just left and avoided contact with them. 

Fastforward to college. I was 18 when I started, and it pretty much went downhill from there. It started at the beginning of college, I tried to fit in way too hard and people caught up on that. They avoided me and this resulted in me pretty much having no friends in my first year of college. I felt so lonely and desperate, that I couldn’t cope with the feelings and decided to quit college and do something else. 

I am not a person who likes to do nothing and dwell on their feelings. I decided to take action and do something drastic, out of my comfort zone. So I decided to become a surf-instructor. I completed my course and went abroad for a year, and worked another year in my native country. It was the same story basically: People liked me a lot and you could have a very good time with me, but I never really connected with people and somehow I felt they knew and rather hang out with other people instead of me. 

This pattern started to make me very anxious, and after some research I found out that I might have a social anxiety disorder. So I took action and went to see a counselor, he confirmed this. I tried a talking group which was kind of helpful and made me feel better. What also helped was that I hung out with an old classmate and his friends. We did MDMA together and for the first time I felt careless. I also learned though, that this was just the drugs. The only time I see this group of people is when we are at a rave and do drugs, I never really get to see them in general, and when we do, we don’t really connect with each other like we do at raves. I feel I only like these people because of the drugs. 

Currently I’m doing another education. It’s the same story again: I don’t connect with people, I have nothing in common with anyone in my class, but they don’t dislike me. The material is not very interesting, but not hard as well so I have no problem getting grades. 
To be honest, I feel like shit, I feel lonely, and I’m getting tired of trying to connect and going out and do things. I don’t know what will help me feel better.

I thought it would get better with age but now I think I'm just getting worse. I'm a 22 y/o female. 


 I don't really have any close friends or friends I feel comfortable around. I've had boyfriends almost constantly for the past few years and I think it's because I feel like it's easier to be around someone who I know likes me and wants to be with me. My last boyfriend and I broke up a couple weeks ago after dating almost 6 months. I really need to focus on doing things myself and making more friends instead of always just dating someone and having basically just them.
 

 With friends/coworkers I always feel like I'm bothering them and they probably think I'm annoying and don't like me. Sometimes I don't know what to say and don't like talking about myself so I'll ask questions to keep the conversation going. I really can't help it, I really don't think about it and EVERYONE is always telling me I ask too many questions. Either that or that I'm too quiet. Yesterday I was also told I over analyze things which i guess is true. 


I'm really self conscious so that doesn't help and I'll just feel like I'm being awkward. I work with a lot of mean people at a fast pace fast food restaurant and I'll get nervous and just freeze up. I never feel comfortable so I can't think straight. One day I was hanging out with someone from work and he was asking why I'm so slow and saying how everyone makes fun of me for being so stupid. That has definitely made things much worse. 


I'm so sick of being worried of what people think of me and worrying people will think I'm bothering them if I ask to hang out. It would be so nice just to feel comfortable. I'm not terrified of being around people or social situations but if I'm invited to something like a party and I don't think anyone there will want to hang out or talk to me I won't go. I'm not the type to just force myself in with another group of people. 


I really don't know what to do. Do I see a psychiatrist? I feel like this is something that I can't just change. Everyone says to just not care like it's a choice but it doesn't work like that (for me at least). I'm starting to realize this is having a serious impact on my life.

I am actually delaying my sleep by as much as posible in a way of trying to avoiding the tomorrow, because I know that if I sleep I will wake as if just a minute passed and would have to face people in the street, school, etc...

When I had this realization last night(2AM) I just started crying, for no aparent reason, but the actual reason is that I had never realized how much my SA was afecting my life, I remember going without sleep for 50 hours.
I just try to avoid the tomorrow, the routine, the everyday activity by making my nights last ""forever"".

and this fucking sucks! I keep trying to sleep as late as posible and wake up as soon as posible.

That is probably why weed helps meso much to sleep, It doesn't make me sleepy, it is just make me not worry about tomorrow.

No one needs to go on watch for me and take the elastic out of my underwear.

My problem is my social anxiety is so crushing along with a self image that is so incredibly low that I feel like I have little worth to others. This is how I FEEL on the inside its depressing,crushing, painful.

On the outside everyone thinks I have it all, and I know from an intellectual point of view, there is so much I have over many other people. But having it all is a double edged sword, if you have all the tolls and things people want from a partner and mate, yet you still feel like nothing and act like nothing what wins out? Plus others see me and I think they believe me to be aloof, not lost.

I tend to explain to myself that I'm really good on paper. If you just listed my qualities and benefits It makes me seem pretty fucking sweet. I am a Gay/(bi) but we'll get to that part later. Graduate Student at Harvard University in Cambridge. I'm smart, I get good grades, I have a promising and lucrative future waiting for me when I graduate. In terms on unique interests, I'm a competitive skydiver who is making massive progress in the sport and is close to getting a sponsorship.As I've said, i'm smart, witty, clever, some say funny (and I did take stand up comedy classes to work on that) I'm in very good shape from skydiving and rock climbing all the time, among other things like camping. not tall at 5'7 145lbs but solid and in good shape, abs are there. Hell i'm even hung really well and a top (i guess gays loves tops)

Home life is also good, I live in a million dollar brand new condo that I paid cash with money from a previous real estate success. have no debt of any kind, and basically travel when I want to, which is where I am now, halfway around the world in Sydney Australia.

I've been saying that I'm bi for a while, but its a coping mechanism. I just use that time flirting with and looking at girls to avoid the more intense relationships with guys. When I do try to meet guys, either my expectations are off on why someone would want me, and I don't to this day know if i put a sense of aloofness in the air or if they are not interested.

being FA/SA sucks as many of us know, but to have all the skills, decent looks, and other incidentals that people look for in a mate all there and still not being able to put them together to do what you want, makes the pain all the more, you see friends with less just doing far better.

So what you get at the end, is a gay guy with lots of money in his very early 30's who has no idea what to do with life, and no idea how he has not attracted a mate to this point. I am not the gay guy doing drugs in the club, because i went through that wild phase before.

I feel I have so much to offer someone, and yet here I am Saturday night, throw away account in sydney australia where I should going mad, but instead watching the hunger games on ppv



And I know its really wrong to say, but if i were just another overweight FA guy, it would be easier to justify why i feel the way I do.

It helped me internalize the idea that in an effort to not make false assumptions, it is not better for my life to make no assumptions. I have since been trying things and I have experienced a large reduction in my social anxiety and generally feel more satisfied with life.


By writing out my ideas I also more clearly understand what I'm thinking, and can see incorrect thought patterns or false assumptions more easily. It allows me to better understand myself, which I really 
enjoy, and to solve hard problems more easily. 


Plus, a diary is like a time machine into your head for your future self, which I already wish I had for my past. 


So if you have never tried writing out your thoughts, maybe give it a go.

If you want something with a bit more flexibility than just a LiveJournal account for writing out your thoughts I'd recommend [WorkFlowy](https://workflowy.com/).

Luckily this semester, I only have to go to campus for two classes, so my work was cut down a bit. English - sit by the lefty seat in the back (I'm currently writing this from between two empty seats in the middle of class). Science - I sandwiched myself between a broken desk and a wall seat in a large lecture hall. It is rare for anyone to sit next to me in a class of 300. 

The thing  about this particular situation is that this class is really pointless. It's a waste of my time and money. What's worse is that I'm the only one in class that seems to realize this, and that makes me feel even more apart from my classmates. Add the fact that I don't really have any girl friends (I'm a girl. This is weird) and really don't interact with girls well, and that makes the fact that I found a female Redditor in my class that dislikes the class as much as I do both a blessing and a curse.

I don't know how to engage her, or if I even want to. 

A part of me does because I want someone to wallow in my misery with me, and I know it'd be beneficial for me to develop social skills with girls in particular. I feel like we have some similarities based on the subreddits she browses during class, and I think I'd end up enjoying what we could talk about. 

The rest of me argues that I hate hanging out with girls, she seems just as quiet with me and won't want the interaction anyway, and our only confirmed interest matches are Reddit and class. Furthermore, I *really* don't want to talk to her. I don't want to deal with the stress of the situation. 

I can't even decide whether or not to talk to her. That's making the process of doing it that much more difficult.

The weird stuff is stuff that I do unintentionally, like avoiding eye contact/saying something odd- I always mean well but my nerves sometimes get the better of me and I might avoid saying something to someone, just wanting to become invisible until I can get out of the situation.This makes it worse as i'm always overthinking stuff.

I often feel as if I am my own worst enemy.  My inability to connect with others is largely due to my own quirks and the barriers I build up around myself, and not due to others.  When I do manage to get close to people, I am still troubled by two main problems.  

First, I often say stupid things; perhaps I am too honest at times.  This doesn't always affect the friendship, but it affects me because I can't help but obsess over the stupid things I've said for days on end, despite the fact that there isn't any way to ""make things right.""  Many times, it is something innocuous, and I can simply shrug it off, thinking that my friends probably didn't even notice.  Other times, however, it is something serious, like a comment that makes someone cry.  I don't ever mean to do these things, it just happens.  On one hand, I'm being led to believe by my therapist that I'm just like everyone else, but I can't help but feel so different from everyone else in these situations.  I don't know.  I just hate obsessing over things I can't change.

Second, and this is something I have not been able to deal with at all, is that I often feel like my friends don't even like me or that they only hang out with me because they feel bad for me or think I'm a loser or something.  It isn't anything they do, and part of me feels bad for even thinking this, but I feel like they are all much closer to each other than I am, despite my (limited) efforts, which is a lot for me.  For example, a friend invited me to have Thanksgiving with her family.  I don't know why, but I don't really want to go.  I feel like she is just including me because she feels bad for me or something.  Maybe she does, maybe she doesn't.

My therapist has told me that in these situations I should find a person (beside myself) to act as a reality check.  Essentially, when I have these negative thoughts, I should tell someone about them and see if they are true.  It sounds quite liberating in theory, but I can't help but think that my friends will think I'm even more weird than I already am if I do such a thing.

I've been lurking on reddit for years and on here for about a year but never made a post but this I feel like I have to share.
Most of my life I've struggled with SA but never really knew what it was or that I could actually overcome it. I was always told I was shy and that I always would be. Well the summer before college I found out through internet research I more than likely had SA. I was incapable of asking for help but I decided to work on it on my own.

It was hard at first I started by going to visit my grandmother who lived in a nursing home down the road from my community college. Then when classes started for the first few days they had people walking around that were there to help new students find classrooms instead of wandering around lost I asked. The I went to community college with many of the people I went to high school with so my next goal was to talk to a girl in class that I had been well acquainted with in high school, she's now my best friend in the world. I did little things like this for 3 years but still couldn't get the nerve to try and befriend new people or initiate contact with anyone.

While at community college I made a lot of friends through friends. I even had a guy or two interested in me but could never follow through. I got to a point where I could function and just stopped trying to improve. I would still be quiet and awkward with people at first but I'd be fine after a while. I couldn't invite people out but I had friends that were always inviting me to do stuff. Looking at my progress over 3 years of trying objectively to many may seem like nothing but to me it was enough. 

Then last year I went away to college and moved in with my best friend and a guy we had been friends with for a while. I was happy to have my best friend with me but I now know I used her as a crutch. Why make new friends when she's here? Her and I did go out a lot and while she made friends I just clung to her.

In October her and I went to see a concert together while in the pit I accidentally elbowed a guy in the nose. I felt awful and wanted to make sure he was ok. He was fine and the two of us talked for a while after the show until he had to leave. He asked me for my number cause we had made plans to meetup at a show. A few weeks later he asked me out if my best friend hadn't talked me into not chickening out and giving the him a chance I probably wouldn't be where I am. We've been dating for 9 months now and they have been the best 9 months of my life.

My boyfriend is Mr social but he understood I didn't like new people so he was patient. He'd introduce me to one friend at a time and even though they seemed to like me I thought they were just being nice. I always thought people just hung out with me because they felt bad for me or I was that friend kept around to make fun of. Well my boyfriend kept assuring me that his friends liked me but I couldn't believe him. Until I met his best friend and his girlfriend. My boyfriend waited to make me meet him because he knew it'd be the hardest for me. Everything went great but I thought the girlfriend was kind of a bitch which my boyfriend had warned me she was. A few days later we were talking and my boyfriend informed me that the girlfriend didn't like me but his best friend told her I was awesome so she should give me another chance. The two of them ended up breaking up but while they were together she was only ever nice when the boys were around. 

I think that experience was good for me because I realized that when people don't like you they usually tell you or make it somewhat known. That chances are most people around you do like you but there are always gonna be some that don't but it won't be the end of the world because true friends will stick with you even if someone doesn't like you. My boyfriend's friends have definitely made me realize that I am likable and people do want me around. They are a bit older than I am and the have no problem informing people they don't like them. I found out recently part of the reason my boyfriend's best friend's ex hated me was because none of the guys liked her but they all thought I was at the very least ok. 

All this summer I was feeling great about everything. I had even started trying to get friends to do stuff. Granted it was my closest of friends but still it was big for me. I had more fun than I have ever had in a summer because I actually had a pretty awesome social life. 

Then it came time to start searching for a new roommate and that was hell for me. We eventually found someone who was willing to move in immediately. I was home for the summer working but my other roommate met with the new guy and said all was good. 

I decided to move back down a week prior to the start of classes so I could get acquainted to my new roommate. Of course this is the week my other roommate had to go home for some family stuff. I asked my boyfriend to come down with me and stay the week but he could only do the first night. I finally meet my new roommate is probably one of the nicest most easy to get along with people I've ever met. I was pleased just knowing he was a decent guy. He's also very outgoing and had no problem getting me to talk. 

A few months ago I decided no matter what it took I'd make friends down here. I figured I'd have to wait and meet people in classes or something which is very hard for me. I guess because in class you never know what people are like, what kind of people they get along with or who they really are. I have a hard enough time usually with new people even when I know they have common interests with me.

Well we also have new neighbors this year and they had invited my new roommate to a party my first night down and he said I should go. I turned it down cause I was afraid and the next day I couldn't stop wondering what if? A few days ago when I was walking into my apartment the girl that lives next door stopped me and asked if I wanted to come to a girls of (place I live) party she was having. I told her I'd think about and it's a long story but she convinced me to come over. I was gonna leave after an hour but wound up staying for like 4 hours. I'm so glad I did because her and I have so many common interests! All the other girls were awesome and seemed to really like me. I never felt weird or out of place like I usually do.

The next night they had a party for everyone and invited me and my roommates over. I again went over and had a blast. They all seemed to really cool and like they liked me which still shocks me a little but I'm actually excited to get to know these new people. That was Friday night and I also went to hang out with just the neighbors last night again. 

School starts tomorrow and instead of being terrified like I usually am I'm actually kind of excited. I'm still nervous and worried about having to get lab partners for my science classes but I think I can handle it.

I know I still have some issues to over come but for the the first time I actually feel like it's possible that I can do it! I just feel like I'm going to have an awesome year for once!

****TL;DR: Basically thanks to awesome friends and an awesome boyfriend I finally feel like I have hope of finally beating this.

I was just wondering if mentally and emotionally people here know how to talk to people and initiate conversation, and talk about interesting and relevant subjects.. But then their body won't calm down enough for their brain to think straight and initiate the conversation? I have a problem where I mentally and logically know how to talk to people, and I can be very charismatic when I want to, but besides being introverted (and having my energy often sapped out of me after talking to people), I also generally get a strong fight or flight response when I talk to people, unless it's the perfect situation (with someone I'm not intimidated with, in private). I've even tried tuning out of my emotions during presentations for my school, but I found that I still studder horribly, and that I lose some of my precous intuition (which makes me a good speaker when I want to), because I've shut down my emotions. Worse yet, the anxiety often makes me want to say whatevers necessary to get the conversation done with, and could potentially make me come off as a disgruntled or negative person. I can be negative towards myself, but only because I'm a perfectionist.

Edit: Because I mostly wait for the most opertune situations to initiate conversations with someone, I've noticed that I have many symptoms of avoidant personality disorder. I'm assuming that this is strongly linked to general social anxiety.

People decide they want to become friends with me before I become friends with them. Does that make any sense? Like they take all the initiative to be friends, and I just go along with it. If someone took no initiative, I would not be friends with them even if I wanted to.

My ideal group of friends would be people that genuinely like hanging out with each other. They don't really like other people so they enjoy staying in and just being around the group. Lots and lots of inside jokes (I thrive on inside jokes. Inside jokes are my entire deal and what make me the most happy.). We make fun of each other but not in a mean way, even after they say something you know everyone is kidding and still loves you. Everything is easy and obviously my social anxiety doesn't get in the way.

I get none of this from the few friends I have. Each one of them are 'loners' that like to be part of multiple groups and have lots of friends. They'll jump from one group of friends to another to another. So for example, I have two roommates that go out sometimes but they don't invite me or each other. They all like doing their thing. There is no sense of groupness. I think because of the social anxiety I attract certain types of people. Aggressive, outgoing people that like to talk to everyone and be friends with everyone but not have a specific group they can say they belong to. Also they HATE mixing their groups. Each group has to be separate and far apart as possible so as to not make it possible for the two groups to become friends. 

I hate this. So I've come to the conclusion that maybe I need to make my own friends. Now obviously this is a huge problem for me but I think I'm gonna try and take some proactive steps to achieve this. But before I do I have a question: Is this a problem for anyone else.

So why would she want to be friends with me - a guy who can barely utter some words to her and bathes in self loathing. Even though she told me that I have a nice appearance, I still don't think it's reasonable enough to be friends with someone, just because you find him attractive, right?

Anyway, in the last few months we have been talking online again and I confessed that I have social anxiety that has robbed me from all of my friends and I am practically alone, except for one single friend that I have, and my parents &amp; brother who live 2 hours away from me - so I seldom get to see even them.

After confessing this, she was quite understanding and told me that she has had some problems herself when she was teenager. She was in an institution because of severe depression for over 2 months a couple of years ago. This fact made me somewhat more comfortable with her. It's not the same thing, but at least she has gone through some issues herself.

Anyway, she told me that the last time we hung out, it wasn't so bad at all and I shouldn't feel bad about it. She wants me to hang out with her again and has asked me 3 times already. She always caught me off guard, like she tells me to go and see her right now. I get so nervous that I can almost feel like my heart is about to jump out of my chest. I always come up with some shitty excuses not to go.

But this time I just gave up and told her that I can't see her right now, but it would be okay if we did it tomorrow. And she was okay with that. Fuck! I was actually hoping that she would say no to me so I could just let it go already. But now I have to go and see her tomorrow. I have no idea what we should do or what I should talk about.

 I have had SERIOUS problems with social anxiety since I was a child. I was bullied a lot, an extremely sensitive and introverted space case who preferred the worlds from her novels over all else. I grew up with few friends and was even an outsider within my own family. I grew up, went to college (where really started to realize just how bad my social anxiety was), graduated just as the recession hit (mid-2008) and fell into a pit of abuse (my loved ones were enduring many hardships and were angry that I couldn't find a job) and a general lacking of most of the things that I needed. I was too anxious during this time to even talk to a clerk at a store. My older brother had a horrific accident which nearly ended his life (and changed him dramatically and permanently) that Christmas and it really affected me, so I became a vagabond, traveling from city to city, couch-surfing and working over the web part-time... Just barely getting by but never finding that place where I felt I belonged.

 Things started falling into place a few years later, when I was 24. All of the traveling around had forced me to work through a lot of my problems with social anxiety. I had a ton of friends all over the world (which was new for me, before then I had 0-2 close friends at a time), seldom experienced any fear around people and I found a prominent job in my dream industry, which led to me getting my dream job at my dream company. I thought that I had finally found this magical place where I belonged and that my family would magically respect me and everything would change... I truly believed with all of my heart that I did belong and that I would from that point on never have to struggle with social anxiety again.

 I was wrong.

 I moved across the country for this job and it was the beginning of a downward spiral because I was not a good fit for the culture there... However, because it was my dream and I wanted to find a place where I belonged so badly, I tried and tried and tried to make it work, and every failure was infinitely painful. The culture there meant that you had to have a very specific personality or you would be criticized very heavily and I just was not that person... This, mixed with the fact that I fell in love with someone who lied to me about how he felt and then repeatedly bullied me over it made me fall apart. The company I was working for chose not to extend my contract, but deep down I was okay with it because after a year and a half of being the office weirdo I wanted out really badly but didn't have the courage to move on. I didn't want my family and friends to judge me. I was desperately lonely all of the time, so I decided to move back home, in hopes that now that I have become somewhat more successful my family would respect me. They didn't... They lied to me, saying that I could live with them, then kicked me out the day after I arrived for no reason.

 This was the last straw. I moved to a city a couple of hours away with an old friend (the only person who knew I was suffering) and spent last winter suffering through little contract jobs, too anxious to speak, working my days in silence, my nights spent drinking heavily while watching movies and crying. My roomie judged me harshly and constantly nagged and tried to change me which increased my anxiety even more.

 Then last month I took a permanent/full-time role doing my dream job with a different company... I moved once again for this role. I live alone now.

 I feel like I'm starting over from nothing. I am petrified of doing the wrong thing, and am desperate to be liked. It is a recipe for disaster but I don't know how to stop. I spend my days toiling in silence, and end conversations with others as quickly as I can so that I don't say anything stupid, even though I say stupid things all the time.

 I think my biggest fear is actually that I will never ft in anywhere. When I was a kid it was easy for me to have confidence because I believed that the people around me would grow up as I did and they would accept me as I am but that is getting harder and harder to believe. I'm 26, now, and I think they have tainted me, because I now hate myself and often wonder what I would have to become to get what I need from others... Even still, I get up every day and force myself to keep going, because I know that the pain of shutting myself off from the world would be far worse than making myself go to work every day and talk to people the best I can.

 In the end we all just need to know that there is no danger here, that people are fundamentally kind and generous and there is room for us - all of us - but it's so hard to remember that when you suddenly remember all of the times when you were denied belonging while you are in the middle of an intense business meeting and there are lots of unfamiliar people around you and you are just trying to keep grounded, wondering what they must think of you and the way you try to mask the fear in your expression as you speak - but it's all in vain, because you can hear it in your voice, and you can tell they do as well.

I just turned 18 last week. All my life I have been shy. School has been horrible for me.

In elementary, from Kindergarten through 5th, I was bullied for being the chubby kid and for having glasses. Constantly bullied. I was so shy that I would get frustrated at things in class and break down and cry and then feel horrible because the other kids would go ""Ms. So and So, warewolf95 is crying!"" 

So that never helped. I was never popular in any sense of the word. I've always, thankfully had several close friends, but until this last year of highschool I only ever had 2, MAYBE 3 REAL friends at any given time because people stayed away from me en mass, making me even shyer and more secluded.

Middle school (grade 6-8) was pure HELL for me in every sense of the word and I feel I am still directly feeling repercussions from it.

In 6th grade, I was in the bathroom using a urinal and 4 or 5 bulliues ganged up on me and were shoving me into the urinal. To defend myself, I turned around, and without thinking, punched them in the face and went to class.

We had horrible administrators that were pure assholes and this one singled me out on this (I know I broke the rules etc. but she really was a bitch) 

I got suspended for 2 weeks out of school in the first month of 6th grade. 

This pretty much killed any shred of a possible reputation I might've had and made me even shyer and more introverted.

7th grade went pretty good, by my standards, and I survived to 8th grade.

This was the 7th level of the inferno for me. The worst year of school Ive had before or since

First off, I got suspended 3 times. THREE TIMES. 2 for defending myself from bullies. The first time, a kid was fucking around with me in band class and made me extremely frustrated so I followed him outside of class after he had called me some names and I shoved him against the wall and beat the shit out of him. The second time, completely uncharacteristically for me, I got suspended for cussing out an admin in the lunch room because they were busting my balls. 

Keep in mind this was in front of hundreds of kids

The last time, the creme de la creme of the shit was two weeks later

I was siting in class and a kid was telling people I was a cocksucker. Everyone else hated this kid too but he was the token annoying dumbshit of our class. I swear im not lying about this -

He wouldnt shut up and I couldnt get him to stop so I poked him with my DULL PENCIL THAT WASNT EVEN SHARPENED

That is extra important because lucky fucking me, I poke him in an artery and the damn thing goes through his skin causing blood to squirt everywhere 6 inches in the air like a fucking move scene - all from a pencil you couldnt write with

Two people passed out from seeing the blood and I got another 2 week suspension. 

The other kid got two weeks as well, but I was let back after 3 days because the other kid was the instigator. 

Ever since then - FIVE YEARS LATER - im still known as the pencil boy. ""Dont let him have a pencil!, blah blah blah etc""

This absolutely MURDERED any shred of popularity I mightve been building and buried it in a concrete grave at the bottom of the marianna trench.

Because of all that shit I went to counseling with a fantastic therapist. We got my anger issues sorted out and my first 3 years of highschool proceded incident-free

Somewhere in my junior year, I came to the realization that I was introverted and probably should force myself to do social things to keep myself from becoming a hermit

Im a self-taught guitarist and songwriter of 7 years and music is my complete devotion and passion (to the extent you could literally compare me to a nun - im dead serious) so I forced myself to join our school's performing talents club.

Made some good friends and all was looking on the up. 

Then I developed legitimate hardcore social anxiety (I didnt realize it for another year)

I couldnt (and still cant) talk to girls without throwing up almost because of nervousness, so when I had to sit all year in a class next to a girl who is literally a model, is one of the nicest people ive ever knwon, and is also angelically beautiful, I crashed into the abyss of anxiety and spent an entire year sitting at my desk, trembling, afraid to say hello, sweating, being scared to even move just for fear of anyone judging me

Moving on, I continued with Performing Talents Club and we had our showcase - me and a good friend performed ""Breadline"" by Megadeth :) and we killed it

Now, my closest friend, the one I did the song with, is a TOTAL ladies man who is constantly eying every female flesh of meat be it live or dead, constantly has girlfriends, etc, while im 17, have never held a girl's hand or had a hug etc. am constantly having to see all this and its makin me feel really bad

So after the performance he goes and casually gives a hug to a female friend of ours and I force myself to do so also. 

Got a hug. Fuck yea

Afterwards, a bunch of us went back to her house for an after-performance hangout just chillin. 

This female friend was aware of my shyness and was constantly laying on me and stuff the whole night trying to break me out of my shell.

Its still the most ive ever felt of a girl - her hair on my shoulder and her jumping in my lap when I sit down so I cant move, lol

Later as things wind down Im freaking out and spazzing like a crack addict without any drugs because ive never ever experienced anything like this before - sad, i know :(

This was the best night of my life to date (its ayear later now) and it was the night that made me realize I legit had social anxiety

For a few months beforehand Id been researching shyness and was reading about SA, but I finally realized I actually had it.

My mom is always saying things like ""get a life!"", etc, because I never like to hang out with friends or im too scared to ask friends to hangout. I have a better time sitting in my room for 6 hours after school strumming a guitar than I do in a throng of 10 people hanging out together. 

Ive never had a girl show any inkling of interest in me (I had honestly never even SPOKEN to a female classmate until 2 years ago and didnt have a female friend until last year), but im a hopeless romantic thats really sad because of the fact that im lonely, but dont know what the fuck to do

It took me 6 months to come out to my mom about my SA - I didnt even tell her what my problem was: I just said forcefully ""mom, I NEED HELP, please"" and she got it (she has bipolar and has been in therapy for 20 years etc)

So I returned to my therapist from middle school and revealed to him that i thought I had SA. I got a prescription for Zoloft and have been taking it for a year this month.

My life fucking flipped. I could talk to my friends again. I could hangout without freaking. I wasnt shaking anymore

It was fantastic, but recently I think my anxiety has been coming back

I skipped out on prom (a friend was gonna go with me out of pity, but I backed out in the end because I like her, but she refuses to date me becasue her ex is my friend, and I dont wanna hang in a room full of people i dont care for, doing Idk what, having to hear shitty music all night - Ill pass, thank you)

Ive been isolating myself from my friends again - especially at lunch. I find resons to go to class early and eat in class alone because its less stressful than dealing with a casual conversation amongst friends

Idk. I feel like im relapsing or something.

Was my SA brought on by my bullying? Or did my shyness simply evolve?

So many questions.....I dont even know why im posting this

As the title says, I don't speak under pressure very well. eg: The other day, I almost got in a car accident(Not in a particularly dangerous way.

Said other driver then drove after me(We did not touch vehicles. No hit and run on anyone's part, just a close call that might have gone badly for a hypothetical bystander.) to a red light, pulled up next to me and gestured to roll down the window. I obliged, thinking he might be wanting to apologize for nearly hitting me, only to get a stream of obscenity.

My response was less than stellar. Something along the lines of ""Right green light drive to learn way you retard."" which I'm sure made an interesting impression on this individual(Not that I particularly care in this circumstance.).

I've also had similar problems where I'm being prompted to speak quickly in a high-stress situation, and I don't have time to put my thoughts in order.

The only real fix I know of is remaining silent a few moments, composing my thoughts, and then speaking. I'm considering trying to memorize some prepared lines to quip back at people in hostile situations, but that doesn't help with friendlier settings.

1363400646.0,21,self.socialanxiety,1ae07w,Afraid to get a job,targaryenprinceling,27,6,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1ae07w/afraid_to_get_a_job/,"Hey guys. I need help... badly. Very badly. I have nowhere else to turn, so I really hope someone can give me some solid advice and maybe some encouragement. To go into detail with my situation would be an extreme case of TLDR and aside from the fact that it would probably result in less responses, I don't want to do make you all spend 15 minutes reading about my pathetic life. So instead I'll stick to what's the most relevant to my biggest issue right now: my lack of a job. First I'll tell you about my job history

I'm 25 years old and started working when I was 15. Between the ages of 15 and 21, I worked at 4 different jobs. The first one I quit on good terms, I simply wanted to work somewhere that would pay more. My next job I held for 2 years, until I couldn't take my manager's bullshit anymore, so I ragequit by going on lunch break and not coming back. I should have said the words ""I quit"" but I never did, so this got marked down as me being fired. 

The following job I began working at age 19. Right about this time was when I started getting into opiates (painkillers then heroin). I absolutely loved this job and I loved the people I worked with, but my addiction started taking over in a way that I couldn't control by around the time I was  21. I was so deep in the hole of addiction that I was forced to resort to stealing to support my addiction. I regret this more than anything in my life, but at the time it was a choice between being so miserable in withdrawal that I couldn't work, and stealing so that I could at least be comfortable most of the time. When I was 21 I got caught, and fired. This was my ""bottom"" and I got help for my addiction. I've been clean from drugs ever since. But I dug myself an entirely new hole.

It was at this time that my girlfriend left me, and I completely isolated myself from all interaction with the outside world. The only interaction I had with other human beings was through the computer, mostly via World of Warcraft. I should have looked for a new job immediately, but I thought ""a little break won't hurt me"". Two years passed and I was still unemployed. I thought enough is enough, so I dedicated myself to getting a new job and finally found someone who obviously didn't check my references.  The job was as shitty as could be and I hated it, but it was a job. I worked there for about 3 months before being fired for a reason that is unknown to me to this day. My boss never returned my calls and I couldn't contact him. 

It was exactly 2 years ago I was fired from this job. In the time since, I have developed a horrible case of social anxiety. I got my haircut for the first time in a year yesterday, and the whole time I was shaking so badly I'm amazed the girl didn't cut me with the scissors. I always feel like everyone is thinking about me, like ""what's wrong with that kid"". I'm not capable of turning off my mind in public. Who the fuck would want to hire someone like that? They'd have to be out of their mind.

So, in the last 10 years, I've had four different jobs. I was fired from all but the first. I can't even that job as a reference since it was just a little ebay business and I don't even remember his last name, and he has since moved out of town. Aside from the fact that I have absolutely nothing positive to put an on application, the thought of actually getting a job scares the living shit out of me. I don't think I could handle being in a room face to face with an interviewer, answering questions about myself. I don't think there is a more awkward person on the planet than myself. Tell you about my work experience? Uhh, okay. In the past 4 years I've only worked for 3 months. School? Nope. I graduated from high school but never went to college.

I know you guys will probably say ""see a counselor"". I have done that and it didn't help. I will probably again soon, but to see a counselor you need a source of income and my parents are at the point of refusing to pay for anything else. I need a job, and I need it very soon. My main problems are what to actually put on the application (do I lie? Or do I tell the truth? No one will hire someone who was fired from one job for stealing and another for walking out in the middle of a shift) and that the thought of working scares me beyond words. I feel like such a failure and I don't know how I can handle being in a place where I'm forced to constantly deal with people face to face. I need as mindless of a job as possible right now, something where there's nothing for me to screw up. Preferably a low paying job, until I gain some of my old personality back. I wasn't always like this. Up until I started on the drugs, I had an awesome life. Between the ages of 17 and 20 I could not have been happier. I had a ton of friends, an awesome girlfriend, everything. I don't expect to have all that again, I just need to take the first step. Baby steps.

I was telling a friend the other day that I feel like I might have ADD, and he let me try an Adderall he had. I felt not only did I finish my work more efficiently, but after I did and before the Adderall wore off, I noticed that I spoke a lot more fluently with people. Normally, it's like I have to actively think about what to say as well as whether it would add or be relative to the conversation, but when I was on adderall, I just kind of spoke my mind without thinking about it, and it felt awesome.

I only really knew one of them because I work with her and she invited me.  Going into this I clearly knew that she was trying to hook me up with one of her friends which I was ok with.  I briefly met this girl she was trying to hook me up with at the bar a few weeks ago. She purposely worked it out so we sat together during the game and went to a movie afterwards and we also sat together again. Well that went horribly bad as I was just my very awkward and quiet self as I always am around females. The next day was filled with (what I think were) panic attacks whenever I thought about the previous night how I made a horrible first impression.

After some heavy peer pressure from my co-workers today, I asked her out on a date this weekend via text and am anxiously awaiting the response.  People always ask me if I am afraid of asking girls on dates because I am afraid of rejection. Yes, that's a big part of it. But this time it feels different. I am afraid of her saying yes. We kind of live in the middle of nowhere and if you want to do anything fun you have to drive at least an hour in any direction. That means an hour of sitting in a car alone with her, that's too much one on one conversation for me to handle. I am dreading this so much. I am dreading the potential for extreme awkward silence. Then I am dreading on what we are going to do. And if shit goes extremely down hill we have yet another awkward 60+ min ride back.  The activity I am thinking about doing is going on a nice little hike or bike ride, then go to dinner and a movie afterwords.

I honestly have a big feeling that she will say yes although deep down in side I kind of hope she says no as that will relieve so much stress. I was wondering if you guys have any words of wisdom to calm me down, or other date suggestions? Or potential conversation topics for the 60+ min car ride? I would prefer to do something outside because the weather is supposed to be nice for the first time in months. Any and all advice/suggestions is appreciated!  This is the first time I have asked a girl on a date (and I'm 23). Whatever happens, I will consider it a step in the right direction.  I usually use alcohol as a crutch in uncomfortable social situations, but I can't this time because I will be driving.

Hell, I even had a girlfriend for a very short amount of time. But, one thing that has always held me back was my inability to take risks. This lack of risk taking eventually led me to where I am now. Anyways, by some bizarre, unfortunate turn of events, nearly all of my friends moved away right before high school. One friend moved to Alaska. One moved to Utah. One moved to Missouri. Another moved across town, and our friendship dwindled. It was just me and one other friend left, and we were both entering high school. 

Well, socially, high school was a mess. I couldn't make friends because of my inability to take any risks. I drifted in and out of social circles, feeling like I didn't belong, and eventually disappearing from the group, feeling lonesome. These experiences resulted in me shying away from more and more social situations, and finding pleasure in hobbies and activities that would keep me occupied in my lonesome. In the end, the only thing this has given me is an intense fear of social situations.

I know most people here are not gay, but this is really the only place where I can get advice on this.

The butterflies get bigger, though, as the day goes on. I get nauseous, I can't eat, my body refuses to sit still. I get all worked up, until the point that I absolutely don't want to go anymore. I'd rather sit in my room. Again. Just like I did the night(s) before. 

People ask me to hang out, and it both thrills and confuses me that people actually want to cut time out of their day to hang out with me, of all people. Me. People that I admire and aspire to be like are wanting to hang out with ME. I can't help but feel like it's all some sort of charity organization that I haven't found out about yet. So I flake. ""Sorry, I have a paper due in the morning...can't make it. Sorry, I'm sooooo tired, I had to stay late at work. Sorry, gotta do this family thing, you know how that goes, haha....""

Sorry, sorry, sorry. I'm not sorry because I'm busy, I'm sorry because I'm fucking terrified. I'm sorry because I don't want to ruin your evening by being present. I'm sorry because I don't want to make you feel awkward. I'm sorry my mind goes blank when I try to talk with a group of people, and I'm sorry I feel like such a fucking idiot when things don't come out the right way. 
I'm sorry my face turns red and my chest appears as though it's on fire when I'm given any sort of attention. 
I'm sorry I laugh too much about stupid things, and I'm sorry I never know what to say when people are upset.



I'm sorry I'm like this. I wish I wasn't. I wish I could have ""those"" friends, just like everyone else. 

I'm sorry that I'll be 21 in a month, and I won't be inviting you to anything. I'm sorry I'll be waiting for people to invite ME out on my own birthday because I'm too afraid to hear people say ""no"".

I grew up believing that my opinion wasn't necessary and now I can't force myself to share it with anyone.

My social anxiety started when I was 12. I'm pretty sure I can think of the exact incident that set it off, too. I used the word ""inconspicuous"" in a sentence and kids laughed at me for doing it. So I thought, okay, from now on, I'll analyze everything I say before I say it and make sure that never happens again.

At first I tried very hard to get noticed in high school. I had some success (I even broke up a fight in my freshman year) but eventually people stopped noticing me. I started thinking there was something wrong with me. I became quiet again and I was bitter about it.

When I was 16, I had a retail job. While I was there, I met this girl. To make a long story short, my first (and only) serious relationship fell into my lap. To be honest, I don't know what the fuck she saw in me. I was so insecure and so worried that she would cheat on me that I pretty much forced her to give up all of her male friends. Not a day goes by I don't think about this girl. Being with her was the best experience of my life and I fucking blew it because of my own terrible self-image. You'd think I'd have learned my lesson.

Right now I'm 21 and in college. I commute. I fucking hate my college. I have no good things to say about it at all. College has been, hands down, the worst influence on my social anxiety. I am literally unable to speak in a classroom setting. I get heart palpitations and I just can't think about what I want to say. Though, I have good grades despite my inability to speak in class simply because I refuse to give up when I hit a wall. I pound my head against the wall over and over until I'm finally able to teach myself whatever I'm supposed to know. This process is painful, though, and it takes a toll on me. I often wish that I'd just be able to ask a question in class and get an answer without having to put myself through so much torment. I can't do it though. I need meditation and deep breathing just to be able to speak for a few moments and get my point across.

One of the main things I struggle with is that I just look so fucking weird. I'm 5'11"" and 130 lbs. I never see anyone as skinny as me. There are some days when I have no appetite, and I can barely eat at all. It's infuriating. I would love to have extra weight that I could work off and make into muscle, but I can't put on any weight. In addition, I have these really strange and noticeable wrinkles on my face that I've never seen on anyone else's face. It makes me look like a fucking alien or something. I've trained myself not to look in the mirror because of how fucking disappointing it is.

I have to give a four minute speech next week in my Public Speaking class and I don't know how I'm going to do it. I feel like I have nothing interesting to talk about and I'm terrified that I'm going to fail.

for the past two to three years blushing has absolutely controlled my life. I have a naturally reddish complexion and sensitive skin, when it's hot or cold or I'm stressed (or god forbid, a combination) or after excercise or after shaving or showering or when drinking alcohol my face is extremely flushed. Most of the time I have red streaks under my eyes anyway. 
At some point in school I realised I could turn myself red by thinking about it, then after that it began to take over. 
It is an enormous crushing weight that means everyday I live in fear, ALOT of fear. Any social situation causes a huge amount of stress as a result, and I find it extremely difficult to relax. I have friends, but have had virtually no interaction with girls in a sexual way or had a girlfriend because of this issue. So I'm lonely and inexperienced, which makes it all worse. 

Because I've identified it as a big problem in my life, anytime someone makes a comment it destroys my confidence. The comments do occur due to my natural complexion, and it hurts so much. I can't even enjoy the natural post sport glow of endorphins because if I'm exhausted (even from lack of sleep, not just after sport) my face is flushed and I'm self conscious and so on and so forth.

I would never commit suicide, (EVER!), because I have friends and family who love me, but sometimes I can't get rid of the image in my head of just putting a gun in my mouth and getting rid of the pain. Again, I would never do it, but I hate how frequently I just get a massive urge to get away from everything and out of my head permanently.

I have tried various remedies over the last few years, none of which I have stuck with properly, because I either have a good week or two, then forget about the problem, or I have a bad time and it makes me feel like no progress is being made. So I hate myself more for that. 

The number of ways in which this has limited me are countless. SO SO many times have I not made friends or done this or that because I just can't handle the anxiety. 

Whats odd is that nothing else really worries me, I have no confidence issues about my intelligence or much else, but just the fact that I can turn red EVEN when I'm not embarassed about what I'm saying or doing but just because I'm worried about appearing embarassed. It's such a ridiculous self-perpetuating problem which has brought me to my knees, and I just don't know what to do. Please help.

Both **try** to lead normal **productive** lives while experiencing **severe** panic and **crippling** fear just from being around other people. 

Wut.

What?

What!?

WHAT!?!?

I would first like to say that MTV has successfully shat on my dreams by using words that do not accurately describe what they produced. 


Second **I realize this was a dramatized production by MTV** but I feel like they REALLY misrepresented **cripplingly extreme social anxiety.**


“During this episode you will meet two young people who’s social anxiety is so severe it makes it impossible for them to lead normal lives.”

**Nonie was the only one who was marginally represented extreme social anxiety because had her mother not given that deadline she wouldn’t have bothered.**

 Nonie and Scott **at the beginning** of the show were my goals of ""normality"". The fact that we're throwing the word extreme around makes me feel like I'm just far beyond help, if what they have is ""extreme"" social anxiety. For me Nonie and Scott faintly mirrored some of the symptoms of social anxiety that I have. I mean avoiding going out, having a lump in your throat, fidgeting,  stumbling over words, despising eye contact – yeah those are somethings that are pretty uncomfortable to have happen, but are in no way “extreme”. Exchange avoidance with refusal, having a lump in your throat with vomiting, fidgeting with shaking with so much force that you can barely stand or hold on to anything, stumbling over words for not being able to speak, despising eye contact with being able to feel peoples eyes on you and it making you nauseous – that’s closer to extreme.  

I was hoping to see people with severe SA (that was literally **DESTROYING** their lives) get help but I couldn't really relate (because it was people with SA that made their lives **difficult**) and its made me feel hopeless. This show has made me feel as if I’ve blasted off the extreme side of the social anxiety continuum.

I guess I've actually been pretty succesful in certain ways but I'm still very far from being cured or anything like that.

Still, in this past couple of years I've learned a lot... from being 100% socially incompetent and quite honestly pathetic to at least being a more or less functional human being, so I want to share some of that I've learned about how to deal with this issue. 

I know most of it will sound generic, but I'm not some therapist or outsider, I'm someone who truly knows what SA means and what it does to you and every single of my words here are the result of many, many experiences and mistakes.

1) You need to stop blaming others or the ""world"". It doesn't matter and it won't help you improve. The only thing that matters is that it's your life that's a stake here and noone but you can change the situation.

We're not helpless victims or at least we don't have to be, we need to give ourselves power over our own lives, just doing that will take massive ammounts of frustration out of your head.

2) There are no easy fixes. If you don't have any social skills then there's no magic pill or therapy that will grant them to you. There will come a day where you will have to face people and the world and you can bet it will be awkward and difficult as hell but if you really want to be happy some day you will have to face those challenges and overcome them. The sooner you accept this and prepare yourself to face this harsh reality, the better. Time waits for noone and the more you wait the worse it will be when that day comes.

3) Drama is big no no for us. Yes, we have a problem, and yes it can be an extremely serious one. But that's all it is in the end, a problem, and any problem other than death can eventually be solved.

Contextualising your life and your situation can be a great way to kick depression away because it helps you understand that it's not as bad as it feels at times and that finding a solution is totally possible.

It also makes you more attractive to others as being a black hole of negativity and pointless drama is a sure way to keep everyone away.

4) Change what you can and eventually you'll learn to accept what you can't change.

I'm not phisically attractive, that's a fact, but focusing on that really helps?, I don't think so.

That's why I've been trying to dress better, get in shape and deal with the largest source of my untractiveness (a rather bad and persistent case of cystic acne). Will I ever be beautiful?, I don't think so, even just being average seems far from sure but at least I'm improving, I'm not just being passive and hating myself for my defects and instead I'm trying to improve what I can.

Even if in the end noone else cares, doing that for yourself is a sign of self love. And love is something most of us here really need.",,False,,t5_2r22n,False,,,True,t3_1ahxon,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1ahxon/lessons_ive_learned_over_the_years/,

I fear screwing up in a job, being yelled at by a boss, being fired, being stuck in a job because I'm too afraid to leave, having fear about fear ruling my life.

I guess what I'm getting at is, I've got such a distorted view of life because of all that fear. You know the people that slack off in a job and don't get fired? The ones who even if they got fired have the skills to just get a new one?

I woke up with my girlfriend trying to talk to me. I'm in the bathroom and I can't hear her over the fan. At some point she's waiting for my response. I tell her I couldn't hear her, this frustrates her because she'd been speaking for a while and I didn't interrupt her to tell her I couldn't hear. This is a common occurrence, but it doesn't usually frustrate her. This morning it did. She storms off and I finish getting ready for work. I go out to talk, but I'm late for work already, so we make it brief.

As I walk out the door the people in the apartment next to mine come out and get in their car as I am getting into mine. They were women or girls I couldn't tell because I couldn't look at them. I wanted to, but I didn't want them to look back at me and think I am a creep. I wait a moment for them to start backing out first, but they don't. I'm feeling anxious, so I decide to bolt. I pull out and leave. They never move, but it was still disconcerting.

As I'm pulling out of the apartment complex I see a group of women gathered around the exit. It's hard for me to look at them, I focus on their feet. As I pull passed one of them starts towards my car, but it's too late I'm already out of the complex and driving away. My window is down and I hear them shout to the car behind me. ""Come on, mama, get your breakfast!"". I see the table now in my rear view. Then I realized they were handing out breakfast to everyone in the complex. I felt like maybe I'd been rude just pulling passed. I didn't know what they were up to. Then I imagined they were trying to get me to register to vote or something, but that didn't make me feel any better. (I already registered months ago.)

I have absolutely no friends and I haven't had any for about two years now. I spend a lot of my time befriending people online and then immediately severing the connection after I mortify myself (which is inevitable). I feel safer that way...I know that it's terrible but I can't handle how much I berate myself after social interactions...it's irrational, I have really tried to stop it but I can never seem to.

I'm returning to college in august and I'm absolutely terrified that I'll continue to be isolated and I'll be so overwhelmed that I'll drop out (again).

I also have horrible performance anxiety but I adore singing to people, which is a conflict in itself...I'll have a strong desire to sing/play for someone and then afterwards I'll have a complete meltdown and I'll feel humiliated. I can't even sing for my mother without crying afterwards.

sometimes I find random people online and sing for them on skype and then never talk to them again haha to practice

my life is so bizarre now...I'm really just a fairly introverted girl with awful self-loathing issues. I become so overwhelmed so quickly by even the smallest interactions and I enjoy my isolation most of the time but sometimes I'm just so fucking lonely, I just want someone to explore and to know and to share things with. 

I keep thinking that ""practicing"" with people online will help but it never does, I'm just in increasingly peculiar situations which just makes me trust people even less.

I have tried therapy and meds and all sorts of things over the years.

I'm not depressed...I exercise regularly, I eat healthy, I read, I keep myself busy...for the most part I'm content but when I'm around other people I just feel so intensely disgusted with myself...unbearably revolting

perhaps I just needed to vent here...I'm very sorry for doing so.

I don't really know what I'm asking for. I recently posted a comment in a thread and several sweet people tried to give me advice but I really just don't even know how to begin

am I doomed to live forever with these feelings?

I've never been in a relationship...I'm 20 and I've never been kissed...I'm so accustomed to it that it doesn't really bother me until I think about my life in the long-term and I feel miserable. it simply seems futile, and I feel cliche...and I detest everything about this.

what do I do? does someone want to talk to me? even just for a bit?

Subject: I feel like I'm constantly under attack.

M/24
Not physical attack and I don't have the feeling that everyone in the world is purposely out to get me.

The best way I can think to describe how I'm feeling is to liken it to being a small child on a crowded sidewalk in NYC during rush hour. People are pushing and shoving me out of their way, giving me disapproving looks and shouting at me. I feel trapped. Everything I do is wrong. I am wrong. I shouldn't be here. It just makes me want to evaporate out of existence.

That's how my world feels sometimes. As I've grown up I've come to realize how scary and hostile the world can be. I'm all alone in an existential sense. I don't have a support group. Every relationship/friendship I've clung to in the past has eventually turned into sand, casting me back adrift into the current. I've come to not put much stock in relationships for this reason.

I feel that everywhere I go people are telling me that I'm wrong, that my ideas are wrong, that what I'm doing is wrong. This constant siege mentality makes me angry and defensive. It's emotionally exhausting to have to have your guard up constantly. I'm a kind person and I want to help people, but I'm thin skinned and don't take criticism well. I wish I could give no fucks and ignore what people say, but I can't. Everything is personal.

I wish I could assert myself more. If I could do that, then I would no longer be the child in the crowd; I would be able to shove back. I could make my own space in this world.

But I can't do that because of my crushing self-confidence issues. (The inability to assert myself and my self-confidence are related and feed into each other like a vicious cycle.)

I feel like if only I were really good at something, then I could cling to that ability and it would give me confidence. From that confidence I could become assertive, knowing that I have it in me. But there's no one thing that I'm really good at. I'm just meh across the board with no passions to pursue. I feel unemployable, unloveable, and not worth the space.

I recently went in for a job interview. It's a technical type job, and I've got some experience and certifications, but having no confidence in my abilities I choked. I panicked and blanked out. I didn't get the job.

I wish I could become a more solid person, strong enough and confident enough to be my own foundation. Maybe then I wouldn't mind being constantly under attack. Maybe then I could carve out a spot for me.

I'm not really sure if I have social anxiety, but from conversations that I've had with people who have been diagnosed, it seems that one of the biggest problems for them is when they look at attractive people and immediately think how depressing it is that they will never get to be closer to them due either to their self image, their own estimation of how 'interesting' they are, lack of confidence, or not having anything to say at all.

I can relate to this, but for me there are two sides to it. I do get pretty depressed when I see 'unreasonably' attractive women somewhat for the above reasons, but the worst thing is how 'shallow' I feel for devoting so much attention to their appearance in the first place, when I know that it says absolutely nothing about their personality or intelligence. I think about why I don't talk to average looking women, or even what some might consider below average. They could be very attractive in other ways. 

But as soon as I think this, I get filled with self loathing at the fact that in the end, I can't get past my hard wired lack of attraction. Even though it's so shallow, I just can't force myself to lower my standards. So I hate myself for not talking to attractive women because I think I won't measure up to them, but I also hate myself for treating these women in my mind so unequally. One part of me thinks about how hard life must be for unattractive women because of this, and another still goes back to thinking that attractive women are not necessarily any better off because people automatically objectify them because of their looks.

I'm curious to know what sort of jobs you all have, and if you have any advice about a job I could get that doesn't involve customer service. I'm not talking about a career, I'm talking about a pay-the-bills sort of day job. For some context, I'm 21, dropped out of college, and although I actually have an Associate's degree, it's useless. I would like to maybe go back to college someday but at the moment it's not an option. I've only ever had two jobs - cashier at CVS, and my current job which is for dining services on a University campus. Although I sometimes make food and drinks at this job, the majority of what I do is cashier work. I've wanted to quit for a long time, but the problem is every other job that's actually available for my skill level is pretty much more of the same. I don't care if my job is boring or physically draining, and I have no problem interacting with co-workers and perhaps talking to a customer on occasion - but I can't stand the endless hours of customer interaction. All I really want in a job is to not feel dread every minute I have to be there.

The main jobs I can think of that would work would be stocking positions and other types of physical labor. The problem is I'm a very petite female (5'1"", less than 100 pounds) and I'm not sure if I'd be physically capable of doing most of those types of jobs. I'd also be game for working in an office but I have no real credentials for doing so (good grades at school don't mean anything if you don't have actual experience to back it up). Not to mention that would probably involve answering phones which is a huge phobia of mine.

**The main characteristic is a failure to talk, and just completely shutting down in social situations.** I remember in high school days when I would go the entire day without saying a single word (pretty crazy looking back). Additionally, I can talk perfectly normally around my mom, but when I'm in social situations, although I can talk, I self-sabotage my voice to mutter, talk really soft and deep, speed things up too much, stutter sometimes, and go to great lengths to hide my true voice.

Other symptoms, from the [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_mutism):
&gt; Besides lack of speech, other common behaviors and characteristics displayed by selectively mute people include:

&gt; - Difficulty maintaining eye contact
- Blank expression and reluctance to smile
- Stiff and awkward movements
- Difficulty expressing feelings, even to family members
- Excessive shyness, fear of social embarrassment, and/or social isolation and withdrawal
- Tendency to worry more than most people of the same age
- Desire for routine and dislike of changes
- Sensitivity to noise and crowds
- Moodiness
- Sleep problems

&gt; On the positive side, many sufferers have:

For the first 28 of those, I lived with a very unforgiving, and unbelieving family,  who would just fuel  it even moreso with Physical and Mental Abuse. Pair that with losing my health care coverage when I turned 18, I haven't been able to see a therapist about it. Luckily, one thing that I have never been anxious about was talking online: If I say something online, I can control it entirely, and can remove myself from the situation if needed, so it's never been a problem. Below is the situation I'm in right now though.

Over the past 4 years, I met a guy online, and forced myself to move all the way upstate to excape the abusive household I was living in.  It had been an extreme change for me, but  it was for the best, and I wouldn't have changed it for the world.

On the job front, I've usually been pretty good at work, with only minor panic attacks very infrequently, and usually only when being coached. I usually tell my employers about it, and let them know that it's not the criticism, it's something I can't help sometimes and am working through it, and I take all criticism well, but that I may get a panic attack, and get a little upset/weepy, and need a moment to compose myself. My past employers were always extremely accomidating, especially since I made sure to never make a scene as best as I could, and not to do it in front of customers. The good thing? My job experience and current carrer path is working with Animals, which I've found is awesome for me, as  it lets me absorb myself into work and love it for the unconditional appreciation that animals give.

However, after moving in with my Boyfriend back 4 years ago, The city we moved to didn't really have any employment opportunities, so even though I was sending resumes/etc, I  only got one seasonal job, and it ended within 2 weeks. I had no issues working retail, and could do 1 on 1 things, and cashier work just fine. Zip up to today however: We've moved back near to my family, due to the horrible employment opportunities where we used to live. I recently got a job with an Off-price clothing retailer as I needed the job extremely bad. This store is 100x busier and more regulated then anything I've worked before, including Sea World. I did not expect this in the least. It also did not help, at all, that the manager had initially called me in for my first day filling out paperwork, then during that day said she would call me within a week to let me know my first day... only to never call me, and for me to miss my first day. This ended up being  further compounded when I came in my next day after, and saw that the computer removed me from the schedule the next week. I thought they were firing me, so I asked if I was being let go, starting to get panicy, and was assured it was a ""Computer Error.""

Today would be my third  day of work, and  they want me to go to cashier fully today. Due to the above happening with my schedule, and what happened during the last shift on Register(I quite literally forgot a security tag for EVERY customer who came through, and every single one of them set off the sensors at the front, and every single one of them was extremely rude, snippy and unforgiving), I have been in a near constant state of panic since my last shift, and cannot see myself being able to work without having probably my worst panic attack in years in the next 3 hours(when my next shift is). 

Thing is, I can see how it would have been fine, I keep my anxiety really low by relegating what I do for the day and trying to keep surprises in the social department to a minimum. I expected the call from my manager: Did not get it. Expected  to be on the next week: was not on the schedule. Expected to have a straight forward register experience: Bombed it first day.

The huge problem here though: I REALLY need the job. It's literally the difference between my boyfriend and I moving out of my father's guest  room. I mean, It's a job I have currently and am getting paid to do. I however have a Working Interview coming up next week for a position I would be MUCH Better with(Kennel Work) and would not aggravate my condition. I am  seeking advice on how to proceed.  I  don't think I can just suck it up and go, at least for today, to my current employer, but I know my boyfriend and Father will be extremely dissapointed in me if I quit or don't go.


**TL:DR:** Have had social anxiety for years but has not had a huge influence with my working until  the job I just got. Third day of work coming up in 3 hours, have been panicking since my last shift, Afraid I might have the worst panic attack I have had in years if I go to work today, Really think I need to quit.

For some reason, I find that I physically cannot laugh, which makes me really self-conscious in social situations. 

When I'm talking with somebody and they make a funny remark, or I watch a funny TV show or video, I am definitely amused enough to laugh, but I cannot physically bring myself to laugh! In situations where the average person would do a laugh-out-loud hearty laugh, I do this small, forced-sounding chuckle that lasts like two seconds and sounds really awkward and artificial, and then I just grin for the rest of the time hoping they understand that I am amused. I can't do a hearty, longer laugh like most everyone I know can. Even people shyer and/or quieter than me are able to laugh normally and without reservation when they're amused. Because of this, I feel like people often mistake me for being much more serious than I am in reality. 

What is wrong with me that I'm not able to laugh? I want to express to people that I am amused and not shy about laughing. It is often that I wish to let out a long, loud, hearty laugh and just get it out of my system, just share a good laugh with another human being, but my body will just not allow me to get it out.

All I have to my pathetic name is a GED (which I lost my copy of and need to find or order a new one). I have never worked. Okay, not never, but after trying 4 separate jobs, three of which only lasted one month each and I quit all three for various, SA and Bipolar Type II/Depression related conditions, nothing seems to have worked out. The fourth job I tried was cashiering, which worked while I was hypomanic but my SA and Depression caught up to me after just seven months and at the end of that time I slipped into a SEVERE low over the span of just two weeks. I watched it happen. I have not recovered. All four of these were within the span of ONE year. It's been over a year since that last attempt ended.

-------------

I can't function around people. My brain does not work the same way. I can't process information the same way, I clam up, I have panic attacks, and I basically feel like I'm going to either throw up or have a heart attack. I forget things and stumble into entrance doors instead of going to the exit door(s), drop change, etc. These are things that happen when I am out buying groceries, etc. Let alone being responsible for interacting with people and answering questions. I remember actively avoiding walkie talkie work, and anything involving telling people where they could find something. These were precautions I still took even in my BEST, over-confident state. Let alone my worst.

------------------

I feel doomed. At this point I almost don't care. Let me shrivel up on the streetside, I'm so pathetic I just NEED to wither away for the betterment of society anyhow. I'm worthless, I'm useless, I'm a shame to society. I'm SAD. And I have SAD. And Bipolar Type 2. 

-------------------------

If nobody here has any idea what job I can do in a rural area that doesn't require interacting with people at ALL (except maybe a boss and/or one or two coworkers, and only occasionally at that. Oh, no phones either), then... I give up. And no, I don't really care. I'd rather die than deal with people. My skillset, if anything, is graphic design and website design/development, because I'm self taught since the age of 12 or 13. But there's no prospects for it in my area, and freelancing is too random. I need a regular job. And if I don't find it within the next 3-4 months, I'm going to be homeless in December. Help me, SA community. Writing this you can probably tell I'm really depressed. I'm apathetic towards myself and my future. Yet, for my fiance's sake, for our sake, I want to try. But I have my limits, and I won't agitate my SA. I'd rather curl into the corner and accept my fate. Still....I must try. Thanks for looking. Sorry it's long and sorry for ranting. I'm beside myself. Sorry, and thank you.

**TL;DR** 24, F, GED (which the copy of it is lost). No college. SEVERE SA and Bipolar Type II. Currently Depressed. Careless/apathetic. Confused. Feeling worthless.

I'm 24 years old, female. I DO NOT leave my house unless I am with one of two people, my sister and/or my fiance. On occasion I will go places with my parents but I usually have to take a ton of anxiety meds like hydoxyzine (which are prescribed optionally to me, I don't have to take them unless I need them). By occasionally I mean like once or twice a year. I am finally starting to be able to drive with my fiance in the car with me, but I will not drive after dark, or any where other than back roads and country roads. I do go to college part time and I will not go into my classes if I am even a minute late, I am to afraid to open the door to the classroom. This has caused me to withdraw/fail many classes in my 6 years of being in college and has made me ineligible for state/federal aid. I talk to no one, even if I am at Easter/XMas/etc with my family I usually sit away from everyone with my fiance or sister and talk to no one unless they talk to me first, and even then its just me saying quick responses to end the conversation quickly.

I regularly try to commit suicide and have a Crisis Plan made out with my therapist and I am a low-medium risk to myself, I'm low with others but medium risk when I am alone, and have previously been hospitalized.

So with the introduction out of the way, I am thinking since I can't have someone around 24 hours a day, I should get a trained dog to help me better take those steps of being self reliant.

The only thing is I can't find a clear answer from all the pages I have visited on what to do and how to get a dog, what breeds they are (since I live with multiple people I would like a small to medium dog but I don't see options like that). I already have 3 cats but we are willing to part with at least 1 of them to make room for the dog; one of my cats is 15yrs old and have FIV and a possible tumor in his lower GI so he is probably going to be put down in the next year or so.

My fiance is the only one working out of the two of us, the 2 others that split the house (its a large house) have SSI, or other incomes and they are fine with me getting an assistance dog already.

Where do I start? How much does it cost? And can I get help from programs for people with mental disabilities to cover so of the training costs?

We had been in the same class for about 3 years and she just flatly refused. I can still remember the feeling rejection. It made me feel inadequate.

When I was 15/16 I really, really liked this girl and had so for quite a while. When I finally took the risk and confessed my feelings rather than reject me normally she made up a guy and said she was already in a relationship. This facade lasted for about a day and she left me a phone message apologising. I don't blame her really, it was a hard thing to do but nonetheless it really hurt and has contributed towards, or perhaps helped to establish, my generally low confidence level. I felt really inadequate and generally awful about myself.

Since then I haven't managed to get into a relationship or even kiss a girl. I find it petrifying to approach a girl romantically because I still feel inadequate and find it hard not to focus on my own flaws. I feel lonely a lot of the time and I end up blaming myself for it.

I showed up on Monday dreading it, and my fears were proven right. I thought I could handle it, I'd had an office job before and I hadn't done too badly. But this was completely different. I was fully out of my comfort zone - I wasn't used to wearing business casual, I was wary of everyone there, I felt extremely uncomfortable for the whole day (9-5, complete torture).

Also things have been made even more stressful by some circumstances at the office that were beyond my control, but I won't get into that.

I'm sure we all feel the pain of endless cycles with SA. 
Most advice I've come across, especially on reddit, is 'Fake it till you make it' and I do try to put on a confident persona, but the blushing shoots that right down and acts like a big sign above me saying ""Look how uncomfortable and embarrassed I am"". 
I've been to the doctor about my SA recently, but he talks me out of it and sends me on my way. I have a propranolol prescription which seems to do nothing at all. Sorry about wall of text, I tried to keep it brief this time but always end up ranting. 

Finally, does anyone know of effective treatments for blushing? Even Google results were inconclusive and vague. The only thing I've seen that attempts to cure blushing outright is Hypnotism, but I'm skeptical. Thanks

EDIT: I should also note, the reason I want stronger medication is because I really need some immediate help. I quit my job a month ago because of how stressed out I was getting, I was at breaking point. I'm still doing my course at university but when I'm dreading starting back after the holidays.

I let myself go after being addicted to the therapeutic effects of online mmo gaming, and from a developing dislike of public and crowded places and a fear of new people and uncomfortable social situations. From what I can recall though, I used to be much more in to going out and finding new and interesting things to do in High School and College, even while having access to gaming at home and in the dormitory.   

  I've gained around 60 pounds since then and I feel miserable daily about my body shape as well as extremely jealous of the social interactions I see going on around me at my office.
My biggest fear is working my tail off to lose weight and feel good about my body once again, but continue to suffer from social anxiety and continue to be an introvert; not talk to women, coworkers, and continue to feel depressed about not being included in small random social interactions I see occuring in my life, so I revert to my question in the title:

Part of it is these intrusive thoughts, like I could be hanging around with friends and having a good time, but then I get stupid ideas in my head like they don't really like me. It seems like these thoughts come from nowhere and if I'm not aware of them I can throw myself into a loop of negative thinking and over analyzing everything. But here's the kicker, ignoring that negative thought feels wrong, I get a compulsion to think about it more and I get restless. The short term relief from the anxiety feels good, but once I get caught in that loop the negativity is overwhelming. 

Also when my SA was a lot worse, I had this recurring fear that I was actually a sociopath and I just used people and was a horrible person. I just feel like I obsess over things and think a lot to relieve the anxiety, but the more I think about it the more anxious I get. 

The compulsions for me are generally just needing to think about it more or researching stuff on the internet. Last night I had an awful headache, interestingly enough probably brought on by excessive rumination, so I just needed to relax. At this point I realized that the more I obsessed on a thought the worse the headache got, so I had to learn to relax and let it be.

I have been struggling with SA for 9 years. Jesus. Writing it down hits it home. For well over a third of my life I've struggled with something that realistically exists in my own head. 

My method consists of forcing myself out of my comfort zone and demanding I feel the social anxiety I fear. It's the no exit approach. Every situation in which I feel uncomfortable is a stepping stone toward the end game. I can learn from each failure and try something new next time. 

Everytime I lose the will to improve/test/scare myself I read the quote above. It kicks me square in the arse and gives me the motivation to force myself into a SA situation. 

I'm sure this doesn't work for everybody. It just make me think of how finite our time is. Sometimes I allow myself to just 'get by', to manage to avoid SA situations, when really I want to reach my potential in this short span of years that I've been given.

Basically, I'm going into my senior year of high school next weeks and I'm a little worried. All my friends last year were a year ahead of me and have graduated. And the sophomores that are coming into the high school generally think I'm very weird because they went through my ex-girlfriend's phone and found out some very personal things about me. 

Three of those girls will somehow have classes with me. I've had feelings for one of them for four years now. We've been through too much for me alone. They are able to skip grades because of their intelligence (which is one of the reasons I felt a little more comfortable around them versus others). It's not just that seeing them makes my heart sink, it's unbearable. I can't hear something about them without hurting.

I don't know why I went off like that, I think I was rambling. I'm not going to delete it, though. For obvious reasons.

Back to my topic: I don't really have that many friends, mostly because I don't really like people too much. I'd rather take online classes but I can't. So...here's what happens. Last year they would have their food before I would during lunch maybe 10 minutes beforehand because I stayed behind in class a little to catch up. So I would kinda awkwardly stand there in line with people in herds surrounding me. They all had friends that would talk to each other and I felt like all I wanted to do was not be seen. That's going to happen this year too and it's going to be worse because of the girlfriend thing and because of the no more friends thing.

Every single day I tell myself that ""Okay, today is the day that I will stop biting my skin"" and an hour later I start the cycle again. I don't even realize that I'm lifting up my fingers to my mouth and start to bite. That's how bad it has gotten that I don't realize that I'm doing it. Do you know how many times I've tried quitting?

I'm scared that I will eventually get some kind of disease through my open wounds on my fingers... or even skin cancer. Although I'm not sure you can get skin cancer this way it still scares the hell out me.

I quit about two months ago. Any progress I made at that job is completely gone. I don't regret quitting but I feel like I am never going to find another job because of my issues, and I can't talk to a doctor about any of this because, yeah, doctors are people too.

Long time lurker here (which is funny for a social anxiety forum, but I digress).  I had been dating this girl from my grad school program for around 2 months.  I've never really had good luck in the romance department, mainly because of my SA and confidence issues.  She made me feel like a million bucks.  For some reason, my SA was minimal around her and I found myself having more fun than I have had in a while.  It was great while it lasted.  Anyway, this past week she just stopped responding to my texts/calls and changing all the plans we had to hang out.  I knew something was up, but couldn't bring myself to say anything.  She finally asked me if we could talk and we did on Friday.  I got the generic ""it's not you, it's me"" response that she wasn't over a recent breakup, which I always take to mean ""it's you"".  Instead of expressing my true feelings of anger, pain, and disappointment, I hugged her and tried to comfort her, telling her it was ok and that she shouldn't feel bad.  I apologized to her for anything I might have done and told her that I really hope we can remain friends (which is not true!).  

These past few days have been absolutely awful.  I have all these feelings built up inside me and can't bear to type her name in to my phone to tell her because I'm petrified of being rejected and hurt even more.

My greatest fear is that I won't be able to function in life. A lot of my SA causes depression because I just feel like less of a person for having these problems. I feel so incompetent, so helpless, and inferior. 

For a while I thought I was just depressed. But I realized my depression was a defense mechanism to stop me from putting myself into anxiety provoking situations. So once again I'm back at my previous assumption that the depression is caused by my SA. 

I avoid people and even when I do have conversations, they are hard to actually enjoy because of the stupid anxiety. And it just feels like a chore, so I think to myself why bother?

I'm gonna be going to therapy soon. I really want it to help. For a while I thought that I just needed meds to fix the depression, but I feel like I've been getting to the root problem.

When fighting against an ordered military force you know their numbers, their technology, their locations. When fighting against a guerrilla group you know nothing. Therefore the first step is turning the anxiety into an ordered army, and gaining intelligence about it. The first step is understanding exactly what it is.

As some of you might already know, anxiety is not a disease, but a mechanism of the body. Actually it's one of the most fundamental survival mechanisms of any living organisms. When you touch a worm and it instantly squeezes - it's anxiety. When a rabbit detects a wolf after it and start running faster and for longer than it might seem possible - it's anxiety. When a human being falls off a cliff and is magically able to climb back up - it's anxiety.

Anxiety is a mechanism that, at an instant's notice, strains all muscles to full capacity, produces adrenaline (to increase the heart rate and release certain sugars required in order to keep high energy levels for a long time from the spleen, liver and pancreas), transfers blood from less important organs and more. It's the amazing mechanism that allows a person to break 2cm metal bars or tear apart a leather band with his bare hands (true stories of patients (*)). It's the amazing mechanism that allowed holocaust survivors to jump off of running trains into the snowy forest with no food and barely any clothes and still survive. Anxiety is quite possibly the thing pushing society forward, the anxiety inducing fear of staying behind.

But if anxiety is such a wonderful thing than why does it appear so bad? Well, because nature have a tendency of screwing up, and because for certain people this mechanism activates when there really isn't any reason for it.
So what do you do with it? Well, as we all know there's unfortunately no cure for anxiety disorders, since they are ""states"" and not ""diseases"",  but that doesn't mean there's no treatment. The difference between ""treatment"" and ""cure""? When a doctor cures someone it's a one-sided process of the doctor doing his job. When dealing with anxiety disorders it's an alliance between the doctor and the patient. They both need to work for a solution, and the hard, black work, is left for the patient himself. The only way to deal with anxiety is to, well... deal with it. **Exposure** is the key word.

**Avoidance leads to more avoidance, there's a process of generalization.** That's how anxiety develops. It might have started from avoiding one person in a certain situation, followed by avoiding him completely, followed by avoiding people close to him, followed by avoiding people with similar interest, etc. Avoidance is a step in the wrong direction.

What is the right thing to do? **Exposure**. Incremental moderated exposure. Taking small steps at a time, **unlearning** the habits that lead to anxiety and learning new habits instead. A real-life example of this is a patient afraid of elevators.
* First step is just imagining going into an elevator.
* Then going into the elevator with the doctor.
* Then just going in and instantly out, without closing the door. The doctor awaits there.
* Going in, closing the door, then opening it and going out. Again the doctor is there.
* Going up one floor, where the doctor waits.
* two floors, three floors, etc...

What are the steps? Well, this is individual, and the best thing to do is to get a (CBT) therapist that will work on it with you. But it will all depend on your motivation, your willpower, and your work. Yeah, anxiety disorders do suck quite a lot compared to other stuff, but don't give up. Nothing is set in stone. Any habit is based on something learned, anything learned can be unlearned and relearned to adapt to a different life. Don't give up. Every time you avoid think, at least imagine, not avoiding, facing it in your head is the first step after all.
I trust you all can do this. I'll keep posting updates here, hopefully regularly, as I deal with it.

(*) There was a story about a psychotic patient who got sedated and strapped into a bed. A heavy, hospital, metal bed. He was paranoid and thought he was going to be murdered at any moment, resulting in great panic (which is basically anxiety).

This is a throwaway account for obvious reasons. I think I have been suffering S.A.D since I was at least 10. I always found it hard to make new friends. I was always shy and felt nervous around people. And it didn't help that I was teased and bullied by kids and teachers in my school, and I was mentally, verbally, and physically abused by my father. Because of these things, I was always an angry or depressed kid. I was angry because I felt that all people were cruel and selfish after being treated the way I did. And I was depressed because I wanted to know why I was so disliked, and why I was so unloved. I always figured that there was something wrong with me. I was a tall, skinny, awkward, ugly girl who was lonely. But I never knew what exactly was wrong with me for me to be so disliked. I tried being nice and friendly to people, but it never helped. I could never seem to connect with them, so because of that, I tend to avoid social situations. This kind of thinking has also lead me to believe that I'm not worth living since everyone dislikes me so much. I attempted suicide by OD'ing on sleeping pills at the age of 15. 

Today, I'm 22 years old. I'm still tall, skinny, and awkward but people won't call me ugly anymore. I can pretend to be outgoing whenever I'm in social situations, but only up to a point. I'm no longer mercilessly teased, and since I'm an adult who's moved out, my father no longer abuses me. But I still feel angry. I still have this irrational thought that all people are horrible. I dislike people, except for a select few like my boyfriend, but at the same time I can never bring myself to show it because of my conscience. I always try to be nice to others or else I'll feel horribly guilty. And what's even more conflicting for me is that I still want to be appreciated and accepted by others. I crave acceptance SO MUCH that sometimes I lose myself in the process. Sometimes, I don't even know who I am. Whenever someone says ""be myself"" I always wonder, how do I do that and will people even like me if I am myself? I know this doesn't make sense, but please bear with me, I'm crying at the moment so this whole thing might not even make sense.

Right now, I have very few friends. Most of my friends are really my boyfriend's friends who only like me because I just happen to be his girlfriend. The very few friends that are actually mine are starting to leave me for unknown reasons. My best friend is no longer my friend because she's been distancing herself from me so much. I tried reaching out to her, and I tried to figure out why she was doing that, but she wouldn't even talk to me. Now she's moved out of town and transfered colleges and she let me know through text. I was crushed. So now I'm left wondering what the hell did I do for her to be that way. I thought we had great times. Sure, we had our arguments like close friends would, but we generally got along great. And now I'm dealing with this. And now I'm worried about this happening to another friend. Just yesterday I tried calling that friend to see if she wanted to hang out for once (we haven't hung out in a month) and she hasn't called or texted back. It hurts so much to know that my friends don't want to hang out with me, and I have no idea why.

Because of everything that I've said earlier, I have grown to believe that I have an unlikable personality and I don't know why I do. I have my flaws like everyone else, but I'm never outwardly mean. I always try to be nice. I always try to be funny. But I'm still very shy, quiet, and conservative so I guess people tend to think I'm always serious and snobby. But what they don't know is that that's definitely not the case. I'm extremely goofy and friendly to the people who I'm most comfortable with. But in social situations with people I hardly know, I'm different. On the outside, I may seem normal (and I guess quietly snobby) but on the inside, I'm an emotional wreck. My heart beats so hard, I can hardly breathe properly, and I'm always thinking about what and how I should look, say, and act. I'm always worried about people not liking me. And after growing up with people who disliked me, and after having close friends drop me, it's hard not to believe that everyone who meets me won't like me for who I am. 

It was even hard to open up to my boyfriend because of this. I'm slowly opening up to him now, but it's no fair for him to be treated that way, as if he's like everyone else. Because I know he loves and cares for me so much, and I love and care for him too, but because of my S.A.D and my self-esteem issues, I can't seem to open up as much. After dating for two years, he knows about my S.A.D, and he's come to understand that I can't open up so much because of me, not him, but I know it's still negatively affecting our relationship. He said that he feels he doesn't know the true me. I've tried opening up to him, and I'm making progress. But when it comes to serious issues like this, I always think that he'll dump me because he'll realize he's dating an emotional wreck of a girl with huge issues. I know it's not the case, but I can't seem to shake that thought out of my head.

And now my anxiety is effecting me in my adulthood. I'm about to graduate from college and I currently have an internship. People say that you're supposed to network as much as possible in an internship, but I find it so difficult to even ask my coworkers a simple question. I've been told that I do excellent work, but I'm horrible at socializing with others. Because of this, most people don't even know who I am because of my quietness, or they don't like me because they probably see me as unfriendly. My internship supervisor doesn't even like me. When I try speaking to her, she always seems like she doesn't want to talk to me. At first I thought it's because she's a busy woman, but I've noticed that she has no problem speaking to everyone else about things not related to work. She wants to know nothing about me and because of this, I feel that she hates me. So I feel pretty lonely at my internship, like I don't even belong. And that's almost always how it is for me in social situations.

I started seeing a therapist last week. I figured that, after crying in the bathroom at work, I can't live my life like this anymore. My anxiety and self-esteem issues are starting to become a huge issue for me in my life every day. My relationships are being effected, as well as my career. I'm even starting to turn to alcohol to calm my nerves, and that's bad. I honestly think that, unless I do something about my issues, I'm going to kill myself in a few years out of feeling like a failure in life. I don't have serious suicidal thoughts now, but it's still a possibility. I'm always afraid in my life, and I don't want to be afraid anymore.

**TL;DR** I've been having social anxiety issues since age 10. Was teased and abused. Always believed that no one liked me or cared for me. Lead me to attempt suicide at 15. Now at 22, I still believe I'm highly unlikable and it's effecting my relationships and career in my adulthood.

I'm 19 years old and these kids are like 13-15 years old, but the older kids are either away or minding their own business. As I don't have anything else to do I hang out with these kids sometimes. I don't know em really well but I thought they were pretty nice and respected me and such. Apparantly I was wrong.

As I was about to go home one of the kids stole my keys. Now this wouldn’t been so bad if he just gave em back to me but apparantly behaving like a child was more fun to them. And there was this other kid, slightly older, which was also participating. So there were two of them. I told them to give me back the keys, as I was about to go home. They wouldn’t and I didn’t know which of them had my keys. 

After a while I was seriously starting to get pissed off. I remained calm but told them to give me the damn keys because it took long enough. Apparantly they thought otherwise. Like half an hour passed and I got off my bike, seriously wanting to hurt someone. I didn’t resort to violence though, because I’m not like that. I finally managed to grab the keys and took off. But I felt really bad afterwards. They weren’t listening, perhaps even making fun off me, and I hated it.

Now this kicked me right back into my crippling depression. The little bit of self-esteem I got was gone. Even though I didn’t really have any self-esteem to begin with.

Mornings I work at their west factory, doing boring documentation stuff. I got this job for the evenings.

I graduated from college recently with a degree in English, and of course I have little to no ""office skills"" --faxing, organizing, filing, etc. 

The morning receptionist is a blonde, 30-year-old massage therapist who I would probably never interact with under other circumstances (if we went to high school together, ""her crowd"" would've definitely mocked me for being ""weird""). She's nice enough, but when I come to the fitness center to relieve her, we both try our darnedest to be friendly, but ultimately our interactions are pretty forced and awkward.

Anyway. The organizational system for registering members, etc, at this fitness center is VERY confusing, with many books to enter stuff in. I've been messing up a lot, and for a while I was leaving notes for stuff I didn't know how to do/ thought I did wrong, so when she worked the next morning she could check what I did. Or I just mention it to her when I come in ""hey I wasn't sure how to enter a check payment"". I guess I stopped leaving as many notes lately because I thought I was making less mistakes.

So I come in today and she says ""Oh, so I wrote up a note but don't take it personally, it's just a general reminder, it's for me to remember too,"" etc etc. 

[This is the note](http://imgur.com/UKAzT)

I always take these kind of things REALLY personally. I mean, I get REALLY upset and hurt. This woman has been transformed into an evil demon in my head, every time I glance down at this note I think of her face and think horrible thoughts about her, alternating between hate and fear. I keep re-reading it and getting mad, upset, embarrassed, afraid. I get furious that it's obviously just about me but she's pretending it's not, thinking statements like ""She shouldn't have done it that way, that's such a stupid way to handle this!""

I do [CBT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy) sometimes for this stuff. But I was just wondering if any one else has similar problems with dealing with criticism/awkward stuff like this, and how they cope.


**edit:** Thanks everyone for the advice and reassurance! This is not the first time I've gotten way too upset over something like this, and makes me feel so much better that there are people out there who understand and can help me break out of my negative thought patterns!

I Feel Like They Do. :( ,xsoulfirex,20,0,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/qmukd/does_it_sound_like_my_classmates_hate_me_i_feel/,"I’m female, 22 in university, and I have social anxiety so it’s difficult to meet ppl and make friends. I’m in a small writing class and there’s a guy “Nick,” who I’ve noticed has been stealing glances/staring every now and then since the class started. A few weeks ago the class had to openly critique each other's short stories. When it was my turn, he raised his hand and complimented my work, saying that it was his favorite. Two weeks ago I was talking to girl in our class (Sarah) and she told me that Nick said I “seemed really interesting, and he wanted to get to know me but I’m so quiet.” Last week she invited me to lunch with them so I went. But now, I can’t stop obsessing over the conversations in my head, and the mistakes I made.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ex. **(On our way to lunch)**

Nick: “What year are you in?”

Me: ""Third""

Nick: “What degree are you studying for?”

Me: “English. … An English BA”

Nick: “So, why do you always sit all the way on the other side of the class?” [my side of the class is pretty much empty aside from 2-4 other people sometimes]

Me: *nervous smile* I-I uh…well I... *continues to stutter*

Nick: *is silent turns around* (The question caught me off guard and I was pretty much speechless. This has never happened to me before ;_; So embarrassing.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We went to lunch in a caf and I was friendly, well I tried to be, but I just feel like I came off awkward and boring most of the time. :( I really wish I had asked Nick questions about himself too. (btw Nick has a gf so i doubt he's romantically interested but he seems like a friendly guy and he makes me pretty nervous.)

**This week** Sarah told me to sit next to her in class, so I did. We talked and stuff, but I felt sort of bad because one of her friends who usually sits next to her came after and was like ""where do i sit?"" and she was like ""oh, just sit next to Jo."" (me)

Her friend ""jokingly"" mentioned that she was being sidelined. I was a bit embarrassed. But we all ended up in a group together and talked, etc. I think I could feel Nick staring at me from time to time in class, but I never said ""hi"", made eye contact or smiled. I was feeling shy. But I tried to make up for that later on in class by asking him what his fav animal was when animals came up in a convo he was part of. He just said he never really thought about it. .... He seems more distant/cold now. ;p

I went to lunch with them again, well, I was about to. While Sarah's friends went to order food, we looked for seats in the caf. She found a table but there weren't enough seats for all 5 of us. It was awkward for awhile and I finally said I hadn't planned on staying long anyway so I'd go. Sarah seemed sad, but I think she was relieved too. She promised next week we'd all sit together at lunch. I said sure. But I don't plan to go. I plan to blow them off next week, make up some excuse. I'm beginning to feel like a charity case, and like no one wants me around besides Sarah.

I'm usually just going on standby, allowing her to rant and cuss me out, but when she touched this subject and went: ""You're ridiculous, you've always been shy around people. You need to get over yourself"", I guess something just snapped. I started to shake and to sweat -a lot when I replied with something along the lines of that, she was indeed right and I needed to get over myself, just like she 'just needed to eat when she had that ridiculous eating disorder when she was at my age'. I of course do not in any way look this way on eating disorders; it is a mental disease as crippling as anyone else, but I couldn't resist.

I feel bad now, but maybe it was neccessary in order to make her understand that my SAD is real and I'm not being lazy. If I could, I would go out. I would do out every day. I would laugh in public, I would wear a ridiculous, attention-drawing rainbow colored coat, just because I *could*

1329927136.0,19,self.socialanxiety,q11cr,"I tried to be brief, but I guess Social Anxiety is never a simple subject....",drev,19,0,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/q11cr/i_tried_to_be_brief_but_i_guess_social_anxiety_is/,"I'm not really sure what I'm hoping to accomplish here, aside from getting this off my chest. I'll *try* to keep this brief, but it may jump around a little. Here goes.

I guess I've had social anxiety my entire life. I don't have many friends; I never have, really. I'm 32 years old and there are two people in my life (that aren't family) that I feel comfortable spending time with one-on-one. Everyone I would ever consider a 'friend' is someone I've met through other people. The people who have become good friends are always the type of people that are very social and outgoing with everyone. They're the people that will talk to anyone.

For a long time, I've told myself that I'm an introvert. It's the reason I give people when I have to explain why I don't have a large social circle. I believed it for a while, and maybe I am to a degree, but that's not the reason I only have 2 friends. I enjoy going out, I enjoy being social - as long as I know the people I'm around. If I'm comfortable with the people I'm with, I can be the life of the party; funny, energetic, charming, etc. But I don't have a whole lot of people in my life that I'm that comfortable with.

A year and a half ago, one of my 2 'real' friends invited me to go out and hang out with a bunch of his girlfriend's friends. I went, and like always, I was the quiet guy. I didn't talk to anyone, really. I did after a couple months of seeing them on almost a weekly basis, but even then I was uncomfortable if I found myself one-on-one with any of them. This is indicative of every initial social experience of my life. I'm always the quiet guy.

I've mulled this over for years, trying to figure out why I do it and how I can get over it. From what I can tell, I'm socially anxious partly because I am afraid that I won't be interesting enough. Inferiority complex kicks in and I subconsciously convince myself that people don't want to know me, I'll just be a waste of time, etc. A related thing is that I don't like inconveniencing people; I don't want to disrupt other people's lives. 99% of the time I'll wait for the other person to say 'Hi' first (even just passing a colleague in the hall) because I don't know if they want to or not.

All of this is affecting my life, driving me into depression. I have bouts of heavy depression because I dwell on my lack of friends, lack of any sort of romantic or sexual relationship (currently, anyway; I was in a LTR for almost 12 years, married for 5 years).

The idea of going out and meeting people scares me. I end up inventing reasons to stay at home and play video games or watch movies alone in my room. Reasons like, *Well I don't want the stress/drama of a girlfriend* or *If I try to make plans with people they'll likely just end up cancelling at the last minute; it's easier if I just don't try.*

What can I do to get over this? Something is broken in my brain; something's not firing correctly or something. How can I fix it? I feel like it's beyond a simple ""Just talk to more people"" solution that's advocated in places like /r/seduction. I've tried being more outgoing, talking to more people, but I always fail. The last time I got a new job, apartment, or met new people through others, I told myself I'd be more talkative, more social, etc. but it didn't work. I just fell back into my regular anxieties.

Except with my cousin and this other guy, the others weren't that close. I would hang out with them outside of school sometimes, but not always. I was usually alone and to myself. I was into what you would call ""nerdy"" things like video games and anime. I couldn't find a person at school that was as nerdy as me. Then again, I went to a private school with only 400 students. I have self-esteem issues that I'm trying to work out. I know I'm good enough, but there's this voice in the back of my head that's saying ""No you're not good enough."" I was bullied by my brother, which might be the cause of my low self-esteem.

I don't really talk to my college friends either. Well I talk to my high school friends that went to the same college as me, but that's only sometimes. I feel like I'm not good enough to be hanging out with them, you know? I'm socially withdrawn, especially after I quit school due to depression. I don't have much human contact unless I go outside, which I am really anxious about. I'm anxious that people are judging me and making fun of me, which makes up the ""voices"" inside my head. I don't think it's schizophrenia, just extreme anxiety. My friends are away at college while I'm stuck at home with my parents. So I don't get to see my friends that often unless they come home for the weekend or it's a break. Most of the time I'm on GameFaqs or on Reddit or playing games on Steam. I've been looking for a job through this youth center, but that's a long process.

Another reason that contributed to my shyness was that we moved a lot. I would make friends in one place then I would have to say bye to them, usually moving to a bigger house. I've probably moved 4 times in my life and neither of my parents are from the army or anything like that. It sucks going to a new school having to make friends again. I feel so awkward and anxious.

About a year and a half ago, I discovered my wife cheated on me with some of my close friends.  For 15 years, they maintained the secret (well, EVERYONE in my social realm knew, but kept it from me) .  People I cared for, helped out when they were down, shared my life with had all let me down in the most personal way possible.

I died a little that day.  I spent time with a shrink, and it was helpful for a period, but lets face it - I knew exactly what was wrong with me, but there's no fixing it short term.

I've since dropped ALL of my friends.  Work and Money stress put the healing on hold.  I've tried to make friends with other parents of school age children, but I'm quirky and they just aren't.  And besides, it's weird trying to be open to people you'll see at an elementary school.  Should you drink?  Should you swear?  What happens when you say the wrong thing in front of the wrong people?  I made some nice photography friends, but don't have the money or time to pursue that anymore, and they just kind of disappeared.  Two old girlfriends popped up out of nowhere and it was nice to reconnect with someone who knew me before I broke, and then I felt guilty about talking to them and just stopped.  It was just easier to talk with someone who already knew me.

This year, we weren't invited to a New Year's party at all, which was a point of big-time stress for the wife.  We could not have gone, but she was in tears for a day and a half over not getting an invite.

Some old friends invited us to a party.  My wife accepted, and I just about threw a fit.  I can probably deal, but if one of the people she cheated on me with shows up, who knows how I'll react.

I don't know what to do.  I need friends for me.  I need friends for the marriage to work.  I need friends who don't know about what happened so I can get past it with some fun times.  I'm gunshy about opening up to people.  I went from being pretty social to socially retarded.  I can't look people in the eye anymore.  Not for any length of time.  I can't listen with interest like I used to.  I can't ...  I don't know.  The thought of being around people is stressful.  The thought of living in my cave like I've been doing is depressing.

I spent some time this afternoon browsing [/r/deadbeadrooms](/r/deadbeadrooms) and it just kind of got to me, so I guess this is why I'm venting a little here.  

Any sort of encouragement or advice is welcome.  Please.  I'm broken.  I'm 42.  What do I do?

I guess it's to avoid interaction in the event it is someone I am somewhat familiar with. But even when I do encounter someone I know, it's not too bad and I just say hi or something and move on.

I've lost a lot of friends and it feels almost impossible for me to make new ones. Here are my symptoms:

-Cant look people in the eye for more than 3 seconds when talking to them without feeling awkward.

-I feel like my voice sometimes is too ""high pitched"" or sometimes it gets ""monotoned"" (Mouth gets dry.)

-I get lightheaded when talking to someone. (Kindve like when you stand up to fast from laying down. 

-I sometimes say/do things and then think back and think that I was too obnoxious or ""weird"". 

-I am constantly thinking that people do not like me or think that I am weird. 

-Whenever I make plans with a friend, I get extremely nervous right before we are about to hangout and it takes a while for me to get somewhat comfortable. 

-Whenever I have a ""good day"" and I feel like my S.A. is diminishing, I wake up the next day and feel like it has ""restarted"".


These symptoms have been depressing the heck out of me for the past 2 years. While it is not as bad as when it first appeared, it is still effecting my life to a point were I cannot make friends and feel ""normal"" in a social situation. Since then, I somehow have had 2 girlfriends (still currently dating one) and around them my anxiety doesnt seem to bother me that much.

I just need to vent.  I'm a 26 year old female and I have had pretty bad social anxiety for as long as I can remember.

I've always been introverted and studious, but nice and considerate of others I interact with.  Well, I've been with my current boyfriend (also introverted, though more outgoing than I am) for about 6 months.  He's really been great to me and I'd say it's going well, although it's going more slowly than relationships I've had in the past (he hasn't told me he loves me yet, and I still feel like there's a little bit of distance between us).  

The problem is, I can't stop crying in front of him.  The other night I watched ""Ted"" with him for the first time, and I found myself sobbing when Ted got ripped in half.  Last night I did his laundry and made him dinner and he proceeded to eat it at his desk while playing a computer game and completely ignoring me.  And he continued to ignore me for the rest of the night.  I finally cried myself to sleep because I was so upset that he couldn't stop his game for half an hour to interact with me.  We talked about it and he apologized but I just couldn't get over that feeling.  Today I keep randomly crying and I even had to leave his kickball game early because I'm still upset.  This sounds ridiculous even as I'm typing it but I can't stop feeling sad.

Maybe related to this is that I've found myself almost avoiding people I was once very good friends with.  I see these people at work and pretend to be busy so that I don't have to eat lunch with them or talk to them.  Not even sure why; it's not like we had a falling out or anything.

I have moderate to severe social anxiety. I have trouble communicating with people. I get anxious and nervous whenever I have to go out to school or when it’s a special day like going to six flags with some friends and I just don’t do well in social situations overall.  


Here’s the gross problem. Every morning when I have to go out I have to take a diarrhea. I've had this problem since the start of high school. You know that sloppy log that you sometimes make? Yeah I have that every time I go out. Every god damn morning! And I know what you’re thinkin, “you probably have IBS” or “probably something that you ate the night before”. And that is a no. I did my own little experiment of what could possibly cause this to happen and I've already confirmed that eating unhealthy meals or meals that would normally cause diarrhea to IBS people is not the cause of my problem.


But I did find this: On the days that I had school or some social event doing down, I had diarrhea in the morning. On the days that I DIDN’T have school or any social event, I did NOT have diarrhea. 


So clearly my social anxiety is the one that is causing this. I don’t know how it causes it but it does. I've had this for 5 years already and I've had enough. I don’t want to spend the rest of my life like this. Anyone have any clue? Do you have the same problem?^oh ^please ^don't ^let ^me ^be ^the ^only ^one

Then there are those few who I sporadically make contact with with a friendship/relationship that seems forced with awkward feelings of guilt for not being someone who does a great job staying in touch. I have this type of relationship with my siblings, cousins, and some friends. I find it hard to maintain close tues because of feeling guilty of my past depressive and isolative episodes.
As I've become mentally healthier by no longer feeling depressed for physiological and horrible anxiety like feelings, (these still sometimes do arise however...) I feel mentally drained and continue in negative thinking and feelings of self worth for ever having fallen so low.
I'd like to reconnect with people who mattered with me in the past as well as meet new ones...If only I felt more positive and social, and not ashamed of my past flakey behavior..

I've been having mental problems for years, as far as I can tell I'm avoidant. I'm very afraid of looking stupid in front of people and avoid pretty much anything that might prove embarassing, like taking up new activities. 

I'm pretty emotional (although you wouldn't know it if you knew me), and want to try a lot of things, but I just never do, I don't even work towards it. Instead, I do the same shit every day, surfing mindlessly, playing the same video games (I usually don't even have the energy to start new ones). It has just become a routine and before I know it another day has gone by and I haven't done anything to make myself happier and I'm starting to hate myself for it. This has been going on for years.

I think a problem is that I have a pretty good ""mask"" by now - I can navigate myself through short conversations pretty well and know how to look busy in order to keep them short. I'm actually a fairly good public speaker. I keep myself in environments that I know, I can usually post anything on Reddit without being afraid of judgment (other accounts). But just the title of this post took me about five minutes and I'm still convinced this whole post sounds very robotic and people will stop reading after five words. I just have enough places to escape to where I feel normal enough to convince myself that I'm normal and happy, but that never lasts long.

I was almost not gonna write this post, but then I realized that then another day would have gone by without doing anything about this. I don't know why I'm doing it now.

Well, that's where the title comes in: Due to all of this, I have never seen a therapist. I've thought about it, but never really seriously. But I'm just not happy and probably won't be able to get out of this mindset myself (although I will probably have convinced myself otherwise by tomorrow).

Suggestions for people with social anxiety?,climbtreer,18,2,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/x3wuz/what_degree_do_you_have_and_what_kind_of_work_do/,"I'm 18, and I graduated from HS a couple months ago. I'm going to a pretty large (to me) community college in the fall and living with my parents in order to save money. I think it has 11,000-12,000 students. I have two friends, one of whom is going across state for college, the other going to the public university in town. One thing I particularly dislike about social anxiety is the way I censor myself for other people, even my two closest friends. If one of my friends says something that I really don't agree with, I don't say anything. I'd rather just not cause an issue. My friends and parents are all Christians, and I've been something else for about a year. I haven't said a peep to any of them. 

I feel that I've reached the line where everything from before I developed social anxiety is coming to an end. I went to an all-in-one kindergarten, elementary, and middle school. I could have a conversation with every single person in my grade, a class of about 90. Public high school was a disaster, but I spent my time writing music and keeping a journal. Go ahead and laugh. I have enough material to perform, but I would be a wreck if I were to try to go up on stage. I can barely fathom performing one of my guitar pieces, much less singing. Going up there is like standing on the edge of a cliff. It seems so dualistic, the crowd likes it, or they just sit there in silence and sip their drinks and coyly smile at their friends. When I finish, they watch me walk to the door and leave, and they laugh and they laugh and they laugh. I wouldn't mind making a little money off of my work though. I think if I weren't afraid, I would enjoy it.  

I'm enrolled for gen ed courses, and a music theory class to help me further my musical understanding. What else should I dabble in while the credit hours are cheap (pre-university)? Can I do anything with my writing? I haven't spent as much time in writing as I have in music, but I continue to develop it every day. My mind is pretty open, I try to see the beauty in all types knowledge. Programming seems fairly interesting on the surface, as arcane as it may seem to me. I've messed around with Python a **tiny** bit, but I really don't know what I'm doing even if I succeed in inputting a command. Is there anything in writing anymore? Journalism? I can hold my own with a camera as well, so that may be an option.

Im a 23 year old guy suffering from some sort of social anxiety. The problem is that in groups of people i get extremely stressed out. And unfortunately this leads to me throwing up. I was always frustrated by this so i forced myself to get out a lot. But this led to a complete burn out about 3.5 years ago. I was unable to go to a public place (not even lectures) without throwing up. Now 3.5 years of life and therapy further I am doing a lot better. But not good enough :(

I'm getting a bit desperate because life is already hard as it is, and this bullshit just makes everything so much more complicated. I seriously have turned down several girls because I just get freaked out so much by socially interacting with someone who has an interest in me.

Here is the technique:

- Place your tongue on the roof of your mouth behind the incisors. Breathe out through the mouth for 8 seconds

- Breathe in through your nose (mouth closed) for 4 seconds.

- Hold the in breath for 7 seconds.

- Repeat for 1-2 minutes.

At the end of this routine, I almost **always** feel better and my physical symptoms decrease in severity. I also use it while taking breaks from work or studying (1-2 times per hour).

Tips: 

- If possible, try this while lying on the floor with one hand on the chest and one hand on the belly.

- Try to breathe with your diaphragm i.e. ensure that you're using belly breaths instead of the chest.

But around strangers, (not all strangers, it depends) some acquaintances, coworkers, and especially someone I'm attracted to; also if I'm the center of attention or have to speak in front of a group (triggers), my SA becomes debilitating.

With SA and quite severe introversion it's needless to say difficult to approach another person, or pursue any kind of relationship. 
Almost 2 years ago, i met someone who is also introverted (among other shared personality traits) to whom i developed an attachment. For various reasons however, our paths diverged and there is no common meeting place anymore. We've been sporadically in touch through the internet since, but the messages are become scarcer and shorter every time. My thoughts and feelings remain strong though, but i can't bring myself to show it. I just don't see the reason why, except my own potential benefits, but i'm sick of being selfish. I don't know where else to turn, but i can't stop thinking about this person and the alternative reality where we're together.

I'm a 27 y.o. male and have been brought up in a very protective (read seldom scolded),caring environment (single child of my parents). I get super sensitive when people put me in a spot. Most of the times the way people do this is in a rude manner which angers me, makes me cringe (heart starts racing fast, speech becomes slurred, it's a hard feeling to describe). This makes me feel bad about myself just because I'm unable to deal with it in an effective way.

For instance, every morning at work we have a small stand up meeting where we discuss what we did yesterday and what we do plan on doing today. Most of the times I notice that my boss drills me to the core as to what I did yesterday and he isn't satisfied most of the times, even though I feel I accomplished what I set out to do. I don't see others being drilled to that level of detail as I am. Even if he does, I  notice people are effectively able to answer him/put him in spot instead. Not to mention when he starts drilling me down in public I get the symptoms I describe above. I realize that part of the problem is that I don't articulate my thoughts very well, that's something I'm already working on.

Now, in addition to the morning stand up meetings I've weekly one on ones with my boss. Surprisingly, he is always super nice in those meetings. On a couple of occasions I've bought up issues which he mentions in the morning stand-ups but he just brushed them aside. I've  also asked if he feels that I'm not doing well at my job but he negates that too. I got a decent raise last year so I don't think that's the problem. I just feel like being a manager he wants to ensure that people are scared of him and he just uses me as a scapegoat to show his control?

The above just an example, it has happened to me with my previous managers and roommates too. Also, I'm an introvert, have very few friends and am not really comfortable in groups/public questioning. Between, I scored 52 and 66 on the social anxiety test in my two attempts so I definitely have some social phobia.

I've just finished meditating and I believe I've finally found the way to get my head around the idea of Social Anxiety, and the effects it has. SA is surrounded with this aura of vagueness, and I used to believe that me fighting my way out would depend more on repetition of certain techniques, such as positive thinking, breathing, etc. than actual proper understanding of exactly whats going on in my head. I would compare this to learning in the last few years of high school, where its more ""the teacher told me"" than "" the teacher taught me"". Now, with this new perspective I've achieved, I feel for once like I'm actually learning something.

Now firstly I should make a few points. I am writing this as my mind understands it, I know one of the hardest parts of SA is trying to explain our own personal experiences to others, and have them understand it in the same way. To that extent this is essentially just a journal entry, one which I hope others can learn from. The second point is that I'm writing this on my ipad, and the first iteration of this text was lost as safari decided it would suddenly close after about an hour of typing. I say this purely because damn I'm angry, I poured my heart out and it was all lost...seriously, fuck Apple. Lastly, I appreciate this is a long story, but if I told myself to hold back in any way it would defeat the purpose. Please read it to the end.
Moving on...

I think meditation is the most important technique in fighting SA. Let me explain why.
SA is, as I said, permeated by a lack of understanding of what's actually going on in our heads. Meditation allows me, when it's successful, to reach a point of clarity in which to base my fight from. I recently read an article where they said it allows us to see the present. A good example would be a huge, completely flat and empty desert. The sun never moves in the sky, and there is no way to gauge where we are or which direction we are traveling. This is Social Anxiety. We can pick a direction, but how do we know how far we've travelled, or if we're running in circles? In this metaphor, meditation allows us to create a tower, one place that belongs to us, and allows us to get our bearings. We can look back after a days ride, and say ""ok I'm still travelling in the same direction, and look how far I've come!"". It adds structure into a situation lacking thereof.
For this reason, I believe everyone who truly wants to beat SA should meditate every day at least once.

To fully understand my story, lets go back in time, to when I was a child, when SA first began for me.
I was a very intelligent child, top at every test, and as such used to a certain level of success and the praise that went with it. I used to be solely interested in knowledge, and the fears of social failure had never crossed my mind. Man, I so wish I could be like that again, the benefits of social acceptance can't hold a flame to absolute interest in everything.
This was a wonderful time, I had a few friends and I was happy that way. Other kids would find me strange, as things I found interesting sounded like nonsense to them, but I was happily oblivious to this. 
Eventually, however, society forced it's its way into my mind. At the start, It was simply remarks from parent or teachers, about how I should have more friends, nothing cruel, simply observations which I ignored. Then my schoolmates began to remark, and after a length of time the feeling that something wasn't right crept in. To be honest, this was still not a problem for me, I loved learning. 
The real problem only began around the age when being ""cool"" becomes important, as a means to have friends and to not be bullied. As others commented on certain negative aspects of mine, as children do without a second thought, I started to see myself as abnormal. Obviously I wanted to fit in, to stop people saying these things, so I tried to use my mind to work out what they expected of me. My mind, however, was ill equipped to understand the fine points of intermediate school interaction, I mean why should I care who kissed who when there's a whole universe to observe? So I started to believe there was something inherently faulty with me, and as such began to panic during interactions. Me, whose life up till then had been filled with success and praise, had failed at something.

I would like to point out that I was blessed to have traveled quite a lot with my family as a child. At 9 years old I was chatting to 30 year olds about their experiences, selling broken lighters to Indians in Goa, and catching snakes with butterfly nets, all without the slightest hint of fear. Crazy, to think all it took was a bunch of children to teach me fear.

Heres where I made the first mistake. During interactions at school, my body would enter fight-or-flight mode. As a see it, this is a point where your mind is shut off, except for simple, quick, and cutting thoughts such as ""run, run left, watch out for that tree"". It makes a lot of sense, because when a bear is chasing you the last thing your mind wants you to do is think ""hey, maybe that bear is just being friendly"". The mistake I made was trying to think rationally while still being in this thought mode, and it's just not designed for that. I also think this is the mistake that everyone who suffers from SA has made. So instead of waiting till we can think normally, we think like this: "" Ooh look a hot girl, hey there's a car"",etc, basically every thought we experience, all delivered in a form akin to yelling at ourselves. Repeat this for every social interaction, or even every situation throughout our lives, and we begin to believe this is the normal way to think. 
This is why it's so hard to rid ourselves of anxiety, we repeat these thought techniques like ""I'm a good person, I'm confident"", but they are all delivered in the way meant to force our bodies to run from danger. Another thing to note is that when thinking like this, each thought is a bit delayed, I'm guessing because more priority is put on your senses analyzing the environment for escape routes, and on making a decision and afterward analyzing its effectiveness. I spent so long wondering why I was so slow at reaching the same conclusions as others, and now it's clear. I would make a decision, then rethink it, and rethink it, on and on till I come to the conclusion at I'm just too stupid.

When I meditate, I can reach a point where my mind and brain are working on the same clock, where there is one single thought process, insanely clever and efficient. I believe ""normal"" people are simply closer to this than we are, and those buddhist monks even closer than them. I don't think I will achieve this absolute state during the day, we all need some part of those old instincts to guide us through a normal days trials, but if i focus on it as a guide, I believe I can beat SA.

In finishing, let me just say this. I know it was a lot of text, and I know it was probably often lacking in clarity, I apologise for this. As I said, this was the 2nd copy, and I realise I lost some of the train-of-thought brilliance from the first copy. Many will probably not understand this, and that goes hand in hand with our affliction.
However, if there is one point that I feel everyone should take from this, it's this:

Start meditating. 

Just do it. Don't make excuses. I know it's hard to believe me when there are a million different ""proven"" techniques to beat SA, but believe me, it works. I hate to say this, but if its not working, you're doing it wrong.
A few points to remember:
* The idea is complete lack of thinking, so don't think about not thinking, just don't think. Hard to explain, and even harder to accomplish, but when you keep telling yourself what to do in your head, those thoughts are automatically the sharp orders that we are fighting against.
*Just let it happen. This ties in to the whole idea of meditation, and really to the whole fight against anxiety. It will not happen in a day, you will get frustrated, but once we reach the point where we understand that ALL thoughts are part of us,and should not be fought, be they good or bad, then you'll know what I'm talking about. When it first happened to me, it was like a brief taste of what we all aim for, just complete comfort.

P.S. I consider myself a pretty intelligent person (under the layer of anxiety), and so I truly believe I've built up a pretty good idea of how to fight this thing. I would love to have all of you understand it exactly as I understand it, but apart from writing a book there's no way to describe it all with written words, and even then I don't think I'm talented enough to accurately explain it all.

all of my therapy/doctor sessions went like this:
- my anxiety goes through the roof, i can barely breathe, panic attacks, mind goes completely blank
- i keep my head down the entire time to avoid looking at therapist.
- my therapist will ask me something and i am too anxious to say anything so i stay silent for the whole session. sometimes i am able to physically nod or shake my head. 
- i sometimes try to communicate with therapist using pen and paper but even this is extremely difficult, sometimes impossible, and causes terrible anxiety.
- i leave my session feeling 1000x worse than before.

i am so embarrassed. none of them understand how hard it is for me to fucking speak. the last time i was in a mental ward for suicide, i couldn't speak so i wrote on paper and the nurse made fun of me for it.

Anyway today was just one of those days where I just sat there for a couple of minutes and just reflected on my life. Deep down, I feel like I hate myself. I don't know why, but it's just this internal feeling of just being broken and inferior to everyone else. Part of me wants to say that's just negative thinking and I should focus on the positive, the other half of me says that I really do have to acknowledge my true feelings before I can get better. Overall I don't like thinking positive, for me my mind spins it around and throws something really negative back at me and makes me feel worse. And the way I see it the negative feelings are stemming from somewhere in my subconscious, negative thoughts and emotions don't just pop out of thin air. 

If someone asked me if I like myself my honest answer right off the bat would be no. Anything else and I feel like I'm just lying to myself to feel better. It just feels like a fact, I'm not even sad about it, just incredibly apathetic. 

So what do you guys do on the really bad days? I just feel like my life is in shambles right now and when I really look at how much I'm failing to enjoy life it makes me incredibly sad.

I have been attempting to shower now since 11:30 and my shower won't heat up, and I have to be at work for 10 o clock. I have been sick for a week, yesterday was my day off, so naturally after running around like a chicken with my head cut off for the first 6 hours of the day, I decide to lay in bed and just be sick. So now I look sweaty and greasy, and sickly. I have to be up bright and early for work. I work with people. Lots of people. I awkwardly talk to lots of clients in-shop and strangers on the the phone. 

I absolutely hate my job more than anything. But it pays me, and it's what retarded 18 year old me thought was a good idea to waste two years and 25,000$ on learning. Now I realize how much I don't fit into this career field. But I have bills and and a degree and that's that. 

Anyways, one of my required ""rules"" about going to work means I need to look my best. Absolutely my best. Every time. It's professional, and I don't want my clients looking at me and thinking that I am anything less than cleaned up and professional. Right now I look like *absolute fucking shit* Like a giant walking human turd that was just shit out of a old mans asshole. My hair is grimey enough with sweat and sick slick to grease a frying pan.

I have never had a real friend before. Never collected any friends through high school, or college. I even met my husband online and our entire courtship for years begun online. I skipped having a big wedding for fear of having to meet strangers so we eloped. My anxiety and fear of social situations and contact with people is pushing me into the fields of depression and my husband ( although he tries his hardest ) just can't understand. I feel so lost, like I am floating on my back in the middle of the ocean drowning in fear. I am having a panic attack and I cant breathe, and I cant do anything about it.

I've never considered telling them I'm not ok, except when I almost got blocked from school and would have no choice. I can't convince myself to break the lie, and now I plan to go about therapy without anyone ever knowing. I guess what really scares me is that if therapy doesn't work I might just...give up, and my parents would deserve to know why.

I took some suggestions and it's been up and down.  Went out and did some photography with a group of people and even though I was very awkward, it worked.  Found some new friends interested in the same thing, picked myself up a bit and was feeling back to my old self again.

Then it happened.  I shared with my wife that I was feeling ready to take over the world again.  An hour later our family outing went south and I broke.  I can't communicate what the problem is because I don't understand it truly myself.  Lack of support, lack of a shared dream, lack of ... who knows.  It's not her fault.  People act and react and whatever she said or did that day that twisted me up inside shouldn't just break somebody.  It's my fault for being so ridiculously fragile.

Since then I've been hyper-self-conscious.  I had family over for dinner tonight and although things seemed to go well I've spent the last few hours wondering if they thought I was just a big wierdo.  I was totally tense before they arrived, really upset when I thought they weren't coming, and well, now I'm just driving myself crazy.

It's affecting me.  I need to stop driving myself nuts and just realize that I am who I am and some people will like me and some won't and that's ok.  I feel like a second puppy dog, just dying for some positive attention to validate my existence.  This is not how an adult should be.

I don't know.  Maybe it's time to go see a shrink.  I can't imagine what to say when making an appointment though.  Social anxiety but not really.  Just social retardation and generally being a nutjob.  FML.

I guess it's not all bad.  At least I made some progress.  Met some cool people.  Actually met a few people who are very much like me.

It went pretty well, and now we're trying to plan what to do next. He threw out some awesome suggestions and if I didn't have SA, I feel like I would have totally gotten excited instead the opposite is happening... I'm totally freaking out! I know this would be a great way to push myself out of my comfort zone, but I'm also worried that if I do and I just get really uncomfortable I'm going to come off as stand offish or even cold, when I don't want to. I think since we're still in the early stages, I would rather be in my comfort zone and let more of me come through versus clamming up, if that makes sense. I want to be fun, and show that I can be and I'm not sure that will come through if I'm too far out of my comfort zone and feel too anxious.

What makes me feel worse is that some of his suggestions shouldn't even be that anxiety provoking, like bowling or checking out some museums. Some others include go kart racing (fun and exciting right? Instead, that one seems to be provoking the most anxiety at the moment =/), the gun range, and pool. I feel like if I knew him better and was more comfortable around him, I would totally be up for some of these things but for me to get comfortable enough it's probably going to take months. Museum seems to be the safest choice, but I do get bored at museums soo... I don't know. =/

Ugh, I don't know what to do. I honestly thought we might just do lunch or dinner again, but in a way it's a good thing we're not. A part of me kind of wishes he just chose something, instead of asking me... another part is happy that he is letting me choose because then I can choose a less anxiety provoking activity. In the end though, I think the result is going to be the same either way... I'm going to be nervous regardless!

Even though I've come a long way with my SA, this incident (which I know I'm blowing out of proportion) is showing me that perhaps I'm just not ready to date yet and why I may end up forever alone. =/

Over the past few months (and since Christmas especially) I've been fighting my anxiety hard, going out whenever I can and really trying to live outside my head, and I've been having some good success. January was my best month in a long time, and there were a lot of times where I was able to get out of my comfort zone and end up actually having great conversations (or at least natural ones) with people I'd just met. I've been a regular on r/seduction and r/nofap too and these have really helped me get out of my head and just be the sweet, funny, chill person I know I can be. Recently I've been slipping, though, and this past week in particular has been rough. Tonight was probably the worst point. I knew I was relapsing (despite feeling good about my life direction and being really productive), so I was going over a lot of 'inner game' and confidence stuff and what not. But when tonight rolled around, it was the shitty me back in full force. Went to the bar with some old friends and some new and could barely make conversation to save my life. Ended up spending nearly the whole time caught up in my own head and not enjoying myself at all. I always seem to find myself thinking of how my conversations with people I'm about to meet up with will go, and I see myself being unable to think of anything and being really awkward so inevitably when we do meet up this becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.

However, I noticed this with [Name of a girl I definitely want to talk to] I know thats my social anxiety kicking in. Then I got started thinking about my social anxiety

What I realized while standing there waiting was that my mind was on the inside. My personality was inside me. Everyone else had their personality outside of them interacting with each other. Being stuck inside me brings me too close to my own thoughts. I find that when I'm able to kick my personality out of myself and make it interact with other peoples personalities I sometimes get an elated, high feeling. That is the only way I know how to describe it really. It is like playing piano and letting your muscles take over and do the work for you. Its in those instants that I really stop thinking about myself inside, I don't even know if I'm thinking at all. I just get on a roll and it lasts for 10 or so minutes.

Or get even worse.

I used to be shy as a kid, but just the 'normal' amount of shyness. I still had a lot of friends and I did well in school, even though I felt sort of awkward around new people, I soon got over it.
Then when I moved to secondary school, I got bullied and ended up with no friends. I turned 'properly' shy and quiet. I dropped out at 13.

Over the next 6 years, I went to therapists and it didn't really change anything. I -wanted- to talk to people, but I was so nervous all the time. There were a few really nice people who made huge efforts to make friends with me, but I rejected them because I was so shy and didn't really know what to say.

So basically, I've been a shut-in from age 13-19. At 19 I started going to a community college and I never really talked to anyone, but I managed a few sentences everyday. That was enough for then.
Halfway through the first year, a guy showed an interest in me. We both liked gaming, and we loved all the same games. In a very small class with mostly older people, he was like a godsend.
We ended up going on a few dates, and he spent hours with me just trying to get me to talk. I never opened up, he made all the effort, and after a while I started feeling so stressed out at the prospect of having to spend time with him, even though he was lovely, charismatic, and we had similar interests.
Eventually he gave up, left the college and got a job. We've never really been in contact since.

Since that guy, I became very cold to everyone around me. I just gave up. Now I'm almost 23, and I never talk to anyone at all. I never make eye contact. If anyone tries to talk to me, I give one word answers or just smile/laugh. They probably think I'm retarded, but I just don't care.
The fact that I don't care really worries me, because it means I'll never make an effort and I'll never have a life. I've wasted so much of my life already. I've experienced very little. I completely missed out on being a teenager, and now I'm missing out on my 20s. I can't drive. My mum buys everything for me, unless I buy things off the internet so I don't have to face a cashier.
I still never go outside, and the more I do, the more apathetic towards the world I feel.
I just want to get out of this.

I'm considering going to my doctor and asking for some sort of medication for social anxiety. I hate having to resort to pills, but I've run out of options.

Has anyone here benefitted from medication when nothing else worked for them? Has something else worked that was completely unexpected?
Is there any way out of this horrible mess? :(",,False,,t5_2r22n,False,,,True,t3_krbwc,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/krbwc/i_feel_like_ive_gone_too_far_to_ever_recover/,

I've always had the attitude of ""I'll just have to cope with it somehow"" but I realised that it was one of the biggest problems I have and that dealing with it could potentially give me a new life. So I couldn't just cope with it and knew I had to try and do something about it.

I started telling myself to stop being so socially awkward and when on my own I would tell myself that I can beat this thing on my own. But as some of you should already know, when it comes to a situation that you prepared for, there's just nothing you can do about it. It's automatic and you cannot beat it just by telling yourself to beat it.

I'm too afraid to see a doctor about it through fear of being judged, nothing being done about it or the doctor thinking im lying. So I've not tried doing anything about it in that sense tho.

However, what I've been doing is waiting until I'm in a social anxious situation and then think in someone else's shoes. How would they react to me and the things I'm saying/doing the way I am now and how it could be seen if I didn't have social anxiety. This seems to lead to me feeling much less anxious in each new situation. 

One example I have is... My eldest son (2 years old) has speech problems so he is visited once a week by a female speech therapist. Most of the time my partner isn't home for this so I am the only adult in the house, as well the therapist of course. 

My anxiety is much worse when in a one-on-one situation with a female so you can imagine how I felt during this hour of the therapist being here. The hour always feels like about 4 hours to me. Every week was the same. I would involuntarily avoid conversation and focus all my attention on my youngest son (10 months old). I always feel angry at myself for this because I am potentially ruining my eldest son's therapy session when I should be heads in and completely focused on my eldest son during these extremely inportant sessions.

I started using my method (explained above) when in these situations and noticed things were actually getting better.

The therapist came again today but this time I opened the front door, said a friendly hello and invited her (and her new assistant) into the house. I asked important questions about my son, questions that I'd been too afraid to ask. I had conversations with both ladies about my son. Listening clearly and taking everything in, as well as asking and answering any questions. I wasn't worrying or panicking, I was actually having a normal conversation with not one, but 2 women, one of them being a complete stranger. It wasn't until the end of the session that I actually realised that I wasn't anxious at all throughout the whole session. Words cannot explain how happy I felt (and still do)! It actually made me feel a little emotional.

Since discovering I had social anxiety I have always been told that I cannot fix it by using my thoughts so I'm confused as to how it actually worked.

Sorry about the wall of text but I had to tell someone :)

I have a really particularly nasty case of social anxiety, which I've had for pretty much as long as I can remember.  I feel like a lot of it stems from toxic shame and the fact that I am absolutely mercilessly hard on myself.  In my mind, I am mediocre at best in physical appearance, my wardrobe hasn't been updated in years and personal style is nowhere to be found, I don't have any relatable interests, my conversational skills are complete rubbish, and overall I'm just a very awkward person.  Right now I'd say the only thing I have going for me in my life is the fact that I have a good job and a lot of money, but this literally does not matter one iota because I never spend any of it and I wouldn't want someone in my life who was only interested in my money anyway.

People in the past have complimented me on my looks and my sense of humor and stuff, but when people give me compliments I always feel like they're either just telling me what I want to hear or they're only trying to get on my good side because they want something from me (money, time, favors, etc.).  And even if they were genuine compliments, it doesn't matter anyway because since I believe myself to be the things I said above, those things are true in my mind.  I feel like it comes off when I'm talking to people - I feel like I'm lower in status than anyone I talk to, which probably comes off in body language and other things, and my thoughts are undoubtedly creating a self-fulfilling feedback loop at this point.

idk what the situation looks like in other parts of the world, but here where i live, the university does not provide rooms/flats for the their students. You have to find your own privately, which usually means you find an offering online, then meet up get to know each other/take a look at the rooms, and if they like you, you're in.


THis usually goes something like this:


* 1) you call them to make an appointment
* 2) you go to a house/flat you have never been before
* 3) you meet people you have never seen before
* 4) you are supposed to talk about how much of an awesome roommate you'd make
* 5) you are supposed to make a lot of smalltalk and generally make a sociable appearance
* 6) awkward silence is a big mood killer


You might have spotted a couple of snags in the list above.


in my case, the awkward silence usually start when we're talking on the phone ( i am bad with phones). The actual meeting then doesnt go too well either, i suppose


 I usually take a couple of weeks to get used to new place and people.


Here's what i do:

- dress up kinda nice, but not too fency
- prepare a list of things about me they might be interested in, practice talking about that
- prepare a list of small-talk-topics, practice that, too


But it all doesnt help too much.


I must have visited 30+ flat and rooms so far, each of which politely declined. Now i m running out of time, which isnt a big helper, either.



Has anyone had experience with this? How'd you do it?

I have hatred towards my parents even though they still support me.  This hatred is directed more at their parenting.  When I was a kid they never made me go up to a cashier to buy something on my own, never taught me how to wash clothes or to iron, … when I see the social interactions between my uncles and cousins, I feel envious and feel like I wasn’t taught anything as a child by them... my dad is very high strung, he always wanted to do things himself so he could quickly finish them, so I never got the chance to learn anything from him... he gets mad over water being spilled on the kitchen floor or even if something is spilled on a camping table.... he is strict, but towards all the wrong things, and it’s also a passive strictness which I think is worse....I always get the wrong vibe from him.. I sometimes see him with an angry face, but then he begins to talk calmly.. it really annoys me and I hate dealing with him... I feel disgusted by him and fear looking like him... this sunday our family was eating at the table, and I saw my dad make an inadvertent kissing face while trying to chew something that probably got stuck to the front of his teeth, and I saw the food in his mouth while he did this, and it really made me angry for some reason, and not because it was disgusting.. he looked like an old retarded fuck-face... he is like my mother’s bitch, the slave/workhorse of the household.. I hate his phony laughs... I’ll give you an example of slave/workhorse... first, I have no chores.. second, my brother got accepted to various universities up north this week, but my dad was the one pushing my brother to allow for such a thing.. for example, asking him for the password to the portal page for the university he applied so my dad could find out something, pushing him to register for the SAT test (my dad did the registration, he just pushed my brother for the information on how to do it), then pushing him again to take it a second time, doing all the work for my brother to find housing for him... and then there is my mother.. I looked up to her the most... but when I was 8-16 she was suffering with depression too.. I remember how she would just randomly start crying, how she would shun me if I tried to hug her, and some of the things she said ""I wish I could have my memories erased"" ""I wish I had cancer so I could die""... she is normal now &lt;I think&gt;...this weekend, my family had no television, and my parents were desperate - they are television addicts. I found my mom in another room in the house that has a second television that works, and she looked like a drug addict when she was on the floor watching it.. and it wasn't some soap opera, it was a commercial she was watching when I walked by the room... I got depressed when I saw that.. these are the same people who always got mad at me because I played too much video games when I was little drowning my sorrows.. as I post this my fucking mom is shouting answers at the television right now.. she is watching that game show with the stupid questions based on surveys. I'm not lazy. Yesterday my mom was scolding me because I don't wash my car (I just recently started driving on my own, but that's from practicing the route before hand with one of my parents).. because my dad usually does it, but I'm too scared to go out in front of the house, having everyone see the hermit child... if our house had a backyard driveway, then I would have done it without any trouble.

then there is the strong feeling of shame I feel when around my parents, not shame from not accomplishing anything in my life, shame from being a son - some type of thing they’ve seen grow up, a mut, some type of thing that then developed hormones and became even more of a spectacle, something that came out of them... that type of shame... My parents just threw money at me... I went to Catholic schools up until my junior year of high school... I still remember one of the reasons my mom gave to one of my uncles when asked why I was going to a Catholic school: “because they’d make fun of him” my mom said.. and our old house was directly in front of a public school I could have went to at that time, perhaps even with my cousins.. so from a young age I was detached from my immediate surroundings and sen as something too important..  combine that with my dad’s optimism, for example, when asking me what I wanted to major in, one time I said an architect, he would then proceed to skip all the lower level steps and realities and start talking to me about how he knows someone at work who travels the world and designs buildings in L.A. and how that WILL be me and how I could work at &lt;my dad's work&gt; (where he works) as an architect.. then when I was at &lt;1st community college&gt; taking science classes, my dad’s talks convinced me I was well on my way to becoming a NASA scientist, in fact I was already one... all that garbage got to my head... 

I’ve always taken things to heart as a kid because I rarely caused any trouble or misbehaved, so the rare moments I was called out in elementary school to write my name on the board by a teacher were during crucial social stages that were mistimed... I remember in 4th grade I sat in the same group of tables with this girl I liked, it was the first time and last time I was engaged in mutual flirting, I was playing with her hair clip and pretending it was a dinosaur, we were having a good time giggling and chatting, then I was called to write my name on the board, and I never did anything of the sorts again, even outside the classroom... I’ve felt like a pervert ever since scared of offending people... after 2 years at &lt;1st community college&gt; I’ve felt separated from my age group... I feel like I’m living a lie. I’ve always been a right minded instead of a left minded person yet my major is computer science, even despite taking those assessment tests and getting results like archeologist and forest ranger and showing more interest in things like music and 3d rendering and reading about archeology and history instead of computer related topics- but I was scared to waste my parent’s money because college is more beneficial to engineering, law, and med majors, if I would have picked something like 3d animation/music/geology/archaeology I thought it would have been a waste, especially for me who struggles to make connections with people, but I was persistent, retaking some of my math and physics classes sometimes more than 2 times, so much time wasted at a community college, and to be honest, now I feel stuck and I dread the future, I’ll eventually have to take more physics and some engineering classes, which are harder than physics classes after transferring to get my bachelors in computer science. I’m not motivated. Is it too late to switch majors? I've also never had a job in my life...

Another lie I is how I portray myself to be this asexual type person when in fact I have deep desires to be in a romantic relationship, but I think it’s too late for that.. I have this fear that love won't be as vibrant as it might have been if I were 19 or 21. Or maybe I'm stuck in a weird ephebophile stage caused by my pornographic habits… since high school I’ve been going to the same websites, and looking at the same pictures of girls who are 18 to 21 years old or so they claim.. they look like little children now. Will I outgrow it?
 
I feel so old. I feel like I no longer care about love - they are just youthful fantasies. Girls no longer smile at me. I regret never smiling back, going up to them, and talking to them (I was so terrified). The things I fear now: not having a job, not having my own money to be able to afford to eat somewhere, living with my parents, playing computer games, not being able to freely drive wherever I want, etc.. would have meant nothing back then.. it was normal for that age, you were just a kid, you could experiment all you want.. but now it’s different.. it’s very odd
 
And there are other factors preventing me from finding someone to love, like I mentioned before, my parents. I'd feel like a dirty, hormonal, mutt-experiment.. if I showed interest in the opposite sex in front of them. And now this odd fear has bled out into public. I fear showing any hints that I am interested in the opposite sex in front of strangers, like my professors, classmates, and any by stander.
 
What sparked this rant of mine was a dream I had last night of finding someone and feeling lucky and happy about it (it was the first dream in a while I’ve had).. before the dream, before going to bed, I had watched this one video on YouTube that made me cry, I was browsing for classical music pieces I haven’t heard yet
 
&lt;the music piece Huapango set to cinematic clips of places in Mexico and its people&gt;
 
I guess it reminded me of my childhood, going to Catholic school, all the pretty ethnic Mexican girls I had crushes on, my Mexican grandparents who have died, how too Americanized I've become (it feels like I'm living a lie even though I'm a 2nd generation American citizen), how I slowly forgot to speak Spanish even though that was my first language, that time when I was 21 and I was getting so many looks from the ethnic Mexican girls who worked at this restaurant me and my family stopped to eat at in El Paso, Texas (we were driving to my house from my uncle's house in Belton, Texas, after spending the holiday week with them), …. all the missed opportunities.... I don't know... I feel like I can't flourish in this environment in Southern California - it’s too crowded.. all the concrete.. the pollution.. the culture.. everyone has so many layers to them, it’s too difficult to get to the core and see what they are really about.. I’ve always been a rugged person, I’ve enjoyed camping the few chances I’ve had with my uncles and cousins on the beaches of Baja California - my health would greatly increase during these trips - I wish I was part of some marine biology team so I could always do something like that

My depression is so bad right now that I've actually completed 2 centurion walks (the walking for 24 hours part, not the 100 miles part) in a week on my treadmill. I am 5' 11'' and weigh 228 lbs. I am desperate to look young and healthy again - I've gained so much weight in the last 2 years and with the prozac I was taking which I am now off of.

I kept losing my train of thought, stammering, not making good eye contact, etc. I started to relax the more I did it though, and just tell myself ""I'm not here for the people that don't give a shit... I'm here for the people that actually do care."" I got more comfortable with the spiel and didn't forget it the second someone opened the door.

I got into a good college and then truly discovered the intense social anxiety in me. I was terrified of going to classes and such so I eventually failed out. A few years pass by and then I meet a girl. She was amazing and truly understood me. We date and eventually make the decision to move away so I can go back to school. Class-wise I was doing great. My girlfriend helped restablish my self esteem and I was passing my classes with flying colors. However, my social life was still difficult. I hade anxiety and was an introvert so I hated going out, especially with her friends. I was unable to hold a job which meant most financial responsibility transferred to her. She gradually had enough and after 3 years together she cheated with a manager at the restaurant she worked at. I caught her bragging to her friends about it online. Ironically she thought his guy was going to be her new knight in shining amour, but to this day has stood her up ever since they had sex. The worst part is she has many friends and family so they all support what she did. I have nothing except parents and a couple siblings who really arent that close. I dont know what to do. As an introvert I want to live alone, but with social anxiety it's hard to find a job that pays well and lets me be me. I have no place to go so I have to sleep on the couch in the room next to the woman who cheated on me. I am 25 years old and have nothing to show for it and feel humiliated that I could not provide for my woman. I don't know what to do.

edit:  We met randomly when I was on a plane flight. I sat next to her so I had to talk to her.

I personally can't stand MMOs, and I'm pretty sure it's because of my SA. Because the social interaction happens in real time, I get extremely tense while playing them. I tried playing WoW for a little while a few years ago, but it wasn't worth the money and the amount of stress the game put on the outdated computer I used at the time. I decided that I might try out some free MMOs and browser-based games to rid myself of the financial stress, but it still really doesn't appeal to me.

For example, I sometimes play [AQWorlds](http://www.aq.com/), but there's always this constant fear at the back of my mind that someone will help me slay a monster and then they'll expect me to join their party and then I'll have an obligation to be friends with them. For this reason, I only play late at night, and only on the canned-chat servers with very few people on them, which kind of defeats the purpose of playing an MMO in the first place.

After High School I have literally just been living with my mom (parents have split) and am now a 21 year old male with very little work experience and no uni education. I've been in counseling for almost 2 years now and although I feel I've improved I'm not 100% there.




What I'm really confused about though, and terrified to admit is that I don't want to be with people. The thought of having to deal with people and deal with the horrible nausea / upset stomach problems that comes with my anxiety just makes me so upset. At the same time, I don't want to be a worthless loser all my life. I'm really beginning to think that maybe I'm just not designed to deal with this world. I have no desire to go out and party, I'm fine with the very few friends I have. But at the same time, I'm not okay with sitting in my house feeling absolutely worthless and like a leech. I want to 'want' to do all these things that normal people do.





Every time I see social anxiety type things it's always people saying things like ""oh I want to get out there with friends and party but other people terrify me"" but I just don't have any desire. I don't know what to do. I want to live a normal and better life, but I don't know what that is because nothing appeals to me at all. This cycle is just getting me so down that at some times I really believe I'm not meant to live. 100 years ago someone in my position would not be tolerated, I'm a guy with no ambitions no dreams sitting around feeling depressed all day. 





I spent pretty much all day in front of a computer screen. I enjoy playing games and browsing the web, but most of the time its just to stop me thinking these thoughts. If I'm not on the computer I'm sitting around feeling worthless or I'm locked into a conversation with my family about how worthless I am. I know the computer thing is not healthy, but it gives me honestly the only happiness I get out of life at this point.

I haven't done much on this account, so I went back and deleted everything I've ever commented/posted so that I could comfortably make this.
I don't even know where to start or if I even apply here. I'm pretty sure I do. But at the same time, I'm not. I can make friends. Sometimes I can be pretty eager to make friends; I can be very outgoing. I tend to talk a lot with those whom I find myself comfortable with. Not necessarily close friends, but I usually look at someone and decide whether or not it's safe to start a conversation and where I should take it. It was not always this way, I was always ""the quiet one"" up until 3 or 4 years ago. The way I talk to close friends now is borderline obnoxious in my mind and I hate it but for some reason I can't stop. Pretty much both sides of the fence wind up with me getting depression and I can't find a happy medium.
So with that, I can say that I am comfortable-- at least in the moment-- with communication. However, there are some issues. 

Talking on the phone, for example, is literally impossible. The people I seek to motivation for don't understand, they tell me to just pick up the phone and call like a normal person. I never answer calls from numbers I don't recognize, and still not from numbers who I recognize but are not terribly close to. I have to be on a SERIOUSLY close relationship with a person to be able to call them. I have never made an exception to that rule in my entire life; aside from a few days ago. I had made a purchase online and received an e-mail that I needed to call the store for some reason. I did my research and found out that they just needed to confirm the billing address. After a few hours of self-therapy and hyperventilation, I finally picked up the phone and called. Waited on hold for a few on the brink of passing out until someone answered the phone. I held the conversation and answered the employee's questions for about a minute before I couldn't take it anymore and hung up. He called back but I didn't answer; too preoccupied with my shaking and lightheadness and this odd taste of blood that I get in the back of my throat when I'm anxious. I was relieved to receive another e-mail saying that my order was cancelled-- it meant I didn't have to call again.
On another note, school just started back up. Thankfully at least one person I know is in each of my classes-- which was my goal-- so I'm proud of myself for that. That is, except for psychology. Now I LOVE the subject of psychology, and I was looking forward to this class all summer. Unfortunately, it's not as I expected. Every day is more group work, as stated by the teacher: ""We're never going to do anything that isn't a game or in groups"". I'm reading the calender and each new event is giving me more and more panic. Tomorrow I have to perform a skit for the class. I almost passed out in my seat when my teacher made this assignment... I still can't believe it's real and I don't know how I'm coping with this or how I'm going to go through with it. There's no way I'm going to address this issue with my teacher, either. If any one of you kind people could give me any advice with doing this is a calm and collected manner (as well as endure the class in general), I would deeply appreciate it. This is what prompted me to sit on the computer and write this anyway.

Something I should have posted earlier: Yes I can make friends. Though I don't have very many. I have lots of acquaintances-- those who I have friendly conversations with. But I choose not to have or hold many close friends. I MUCH prefer to be by myself. Over the summer I only left the house to hang out with friends twice. I don't particularly mind being social, I'd just prefer not to. I will only if I have to or must hold to a commitment. Though I will never do large social events such as parties, dances, etc. I have a psychologist, though she isn't much help and I don't talk with her much on the personal matters. If she finds something ""wrong"" with me I quickly get defensive and change the subject if I find that her words ring true.

Getting a bit more glum, I did previously binge drink every morning as I felt it alleviated the anxiety I would have about the day to come. Especially every day before school. Though it wound me in a very bad place, and I am thankful to have those who helped me out of it. I never plan on drinking again and I'm glad to have reached that resolve so early on. These days I find myself smoking marijuana before doing absolutely anything or going absolutely anywhere; the heavy use started about 5 months ago when I got off probation from alcohol. 3 weeks without now, unwillingly, and it's terrifying to face some things sober (especially since the start of school). I wish it weren't that way. I know it's a road that can land me in trouble if I'm not careful. I'm just unsure of what to do about it; I just want to get some sense of calm. I want to be able to like myself more than two seconds after words fall out of my mouth.

Anyway. That's me. That's why I'm posting here and having a mild freak-out in doing so. I'm sorry if I have said anything you oppose... I always find myself deleting what I've written after one or two downvotes in fear of that dark storm. o_o

However, when it comes to opinions or interests, I feel rather uncomfortable doing so.

I'm afraid that I may have misinterpreted what the other person wants to know and may give them ""misinformation"" (say something with a meaning I didn't intend).

Even if I think that I have understood their question (or whatever it is), I think that I am unable to articulate clearly what it is that I want to describe.

Also, I'm afraid that they may react negatively towards what my interest or opinion is, such as ""oh that's stupid, why do you like/think that?"" and I feel that I am unable to substantiate my reason clearly to say why I like/believe in X. I feel like I would need some time to think up reasons or whatever in a coherent matter before stating so.

*Addendum: I think also if I make an opinionated statement, I have to be sure about it before ""claiming"" that I actually do like/believe what I am saying to be...like I feel like I need to know a decent amount about the topic. If I don't, I don't want to put myself in a position where I have no idea what I'm talking about and feel like I'm lying about what I claim to be interested in. Kind of relates to needing to be able to have enough ""supporting evidence"" to assert my interest/belief.*

(This would probably count as another question, but I will include it anyway. I have difficulty speaking up clearly and audibly (So what are some ways to develop a better conversation voice?), and have trouble with eye contact. I think my eye contact has improved a little, but I feel that it is noticeable that it does not seem natural in a way...and trying to balance comprehending the conversation and eye contact can sometimes be a challenge (if that makes sense)...Continuing on the tangent, I feel that sometimes my anxiety is noticeable to other people...that they can ""see through"" me kind of thing.)

**edit: Follow up questions:**

*-How do you develop the mindset that your thoughts, personality, feelings (etc.) are ""valid"" and have ""merit"", and that there is no need for shame when sharing and disseminating them? Maybe this is just a symptom of a ""deeper"" issue.*

[Challenging Negative Thoughts] (http://www.succeedsocially.com/challengethoughts)

[Accepting Negative Thoughts] (http://www.succeedsocially.com/rollwiththoughts)

*I was reading through succeedsocially articles and I believe the ""deeper"" issue is probably cognitive distortions (related links above). Particularly, in my case I found that I tend to exhibit the following:*

* Disqualifying the positive
* Jumping to Conclusions
* Magnification/Minimization (Ex: Blowing up a simple social interaction to something as a method of scrutiny when the ""motivation"" for the interaction is not for vigilant scrutiny)
* Catastrophizing (Ex: Assuming that the other person will respond negatively to what I have to do or say)
* Should statements (Ex: I feel like I need to have certain amount of knowledge to answer when it may not be necessary...I think this may be rooted in my perception of elitism, exclusivity, and arrogance that sometimes arises in some groups (""why should I claim that I am interested in X or an expert/knowledgeable at X if I may only have a supposedly superficial grasp of X? There are these other people who would put down my interest and try to preserve their sense of superiority"" I am guessing I will need to give these people less attention.)
* Personalization (Ex: This kind of goes with the idea of dissociating an action to your identity. I think I need to somehow try to develop the idea that my presence/me may not have been the direct cause for external remarks.)
* Explanatory style (I feel that people may have ulterior motives for innocuous actions (""you're only doing/saying that b/c...), and this kind of thinking should not be applied to such light-hearted actions)

Recognition is one thing, but I guess it will just take some ""note-taking"", diligence, and practice to ""get over"" these distortions.

I'm not sure, I guess I may update this post from time to time. Too lazy to format nicely at the moment.

I'm not into all of that hippie mysticism/romanticism off the deep-end living.

What am I doing wrong?,nevergonnadoit,17,2,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/rkkd3/about_90_of_the_reason_i_got_help_for_social/,"I got help for social anxiety a while ago. It was a study so it only lasted for a couple of months but I have definitely seen an improvement in my anxiety. I can talk to people now, look them in the eye, all sorts of stuff. Obviously it's not perfect (ie: still get nervous around people, girls in general), but much much better than it was before. 

But my friends situation has taken a toll for the worse. The two people I told about my social anxiety, I hardly see them anymore. Granted I didn't see them a lot before but I just kind of thought that after I told them, they would know that they have to take the initiative and forcefully hang out with me. I personally have invited them to stuff but something is always up. I understand that people are busy and have their own lives but if I had other friends I wouldn't even notice their absence so much. Also, since I live in my head so much, I no longer talk/hang out with my roommates anymore. Both my roommates have their own friends that they hang out with more and more. I end up sitting in my room while they are out doing shit, just thinking about how much everything sucks.

As I'm typing and thinking about the past couple of months, I realize that maybe I haven't taken as much of an initiative to do stuff with my friends as I should have. That's probably one thing I was doing wrong. But what about making new friends? How do I make new friends? If I had a bigger pool of people, I wouldn't feel so bad that one of them is busy or doesn't want to hang out with me. I still haven't figured out the talking to someone you don't know part of social anxiety. 

Before my treatment I could have probably called someone up and we could have hung out (even though I would have never called cause I'm too scared). Now I can't even do that anymore. My daily interaction with people has gone down a lot too. Since me and my roommates don't talk as much, me having a conversation with anyone during a day is about 50-50 chance. This is all while I'm in college where there are about a billion people to talk to.

I am wondering if any of you have stories that you can now kind of laugh about looking back?

I have a story that I posted a while back in an IAmA:

My cousin also has an awesome story about escaping which we love to laugh about, even though it was super embarrassing for him.

So he was doing an internet based psychology study, a real online college. He could do almost everything from home, except for the central exams and 'practical days'. This meant he had to go to a city near him and sit in a class with other students.

So the study was going great and he went there the first time. The teacher said they had to form groups after the break and do some role playing scenarios. He was forced to make a group then and there and after that it was break time. He said he was going out for a smoke, but when he was outside he bolted for his car, and drove off.

Not much came of it and he had time to recover, so a few months later the next 'practical day' came around. He got bold again and went there again. This time he had to answer some questions from the students who he left out to hang last time, he brushed it off saying he had had a family emergency.

So this time they had to form groups again, but also hold a small presentation in front of the class. Needless to say, he panicked again. This time in the break he was about to sneak out again, but the people in his group where kindof on to him. He went outside, but they did too (preparing the presentation as a group). He then said he had to get something from his car as an excuse. He got in, started the car and tried to floor it out of there, however the GATE of the parkinglot was closed (conspiracy?). He couldn't leave and his group was looking at him like ""WTF, really??"".

So he got out and rang the buzzer at the gate, while one guy of his group was walking towards him asking him what he was doing. The guy behind the speaker asked what he wanted and he told him he had to leave NOW, the guy buzzed the gate open. The guy who coming for him was standing a few feet away and my cousin just ignored him and drove off.

Needless to say after this one, he refused to EVER go back to a 'practical day' and had to drop out. Sad story of course, but also pretty funny.

*TL;DR super awkward story about my cousin sneaking out of his college classes and ended up dropping out*

I'm really hoping I find someone else that does the same thing I do and has changed for the better! Anyways, here's my strategy (don't do this, it causes me a whole different kind of pain):

So SA makes it a tiny bit hard to go to classes, especially when there's a lot of walking and bus-riding involved. I went to a school that required going to class if you wanted to pass it. I tried my best to manage not going to class, being fake around friends so they would think I was cool and passing my classes but the grades were reflecting the truth.

My parents gave me 2 or 3 ultimatums before my dad finally said to me that if I don't pass, he's kicking me out of the house and disowning me. He said, ""When you turn 24, that's it. I have no son."" That was one of the ""realest"" moments I've had with him and the thought of that made me react in a weird way. I thought to myself, ""Okay, then. You want fucking grades? I'll get your fucking grades!"" and yes I was pissed. I carried this anger every day (even cultivated it!) for the next two semesters and passed every class, even got an A on a 4000 level class. It got results! But I had no peace. Every day when I walked past people I would notice that they take one look at me and want to get away asap. This cultivated more anger. Anger is a strong thing if you submit to it...

I wanted to see how far holding on to anger could take me. I went from staying in my room 90% of the day to pledging at a fraternity the next semester. I got initiated. I looked people dead in the eye and then THEY started looking away. My attitude was basically, ""Oh yeah? You think I can't do this? Fuck you I'm doing it"", so I pushed myself into doing things in social situations that even someone without SA probably wouldn't do. 

So what's the bad part about this? I went from being a mostly compassionate person to hating EVERYTHING. Seriously. Also, I feel fake 100% of the time, like my life is on a script and what I say and do is just to act it out. And the worst part is, there's always the background awkwardness of giving off anger vibes around me and seeing its manifestations on people.

So, there you have it. For those of you that feel the anxiety and would do anything outside of exposures just so you can get your stuff done, I've given you a way to do it. Create and cultivate anger at SA. At everything. It really does get results. Just be warned that you're sacrificing who you really are and this does not create intimate relationships (how could it? It's being fake to people). But if you were in a jam like me, backed into a corner when only action would solve anything, then perhaps the best thing to do is what I did: get pissed off.

At my age I feel I should be making headway into some kind of career with a future, but I'm just as stuck as I've ever been. I'm trying very hard to get out and meet people seeing as I determined it as the most pressing goal in my life right now, but every time I do I have to dread (amongst other things) that obnoxious question that always rises up ""what do you do?"". It's to the point where it makes me angry just thinking about it and I want to punch people in the face for asking it and tell them it's ""none of their fucking business"". I realize that's a completely illogical way of thinking, but it's just how I feel. To a certain extent I can BS some answers, but the reality is that I've been unemployed for a very long time, and it's largely been due to my anxiety. Perhaps if I had some kind of hobby I can say I've been spending my time on that yielded something productive (ie, an art or something) I'd be able to say I'm doing something with my time, but the anxiety has lead to depression which prevents that. 

A year ago I thought fixing my anxiety was more important, but I realized that my lack of career was making that so much harder so I realized that I probably should address it prior. Even though I desperately feel I'm running out of time with both these things (and far more so the social stuff, which is why I thought it was more pressing to fix), I can't really focus on both issues without becoming very overwhelmed. So for now I've put my social anxiety aside in order to figure out this employment thing, but I keep questioning whether or not that is a good idea. In the meantime it just aggravates me that who you are is so tied into what you do for a living amongst people you've never met. I essentially have a built in reason for people to not want to get to know me, that shows itself immediately. I'm not even going to mention the garbage state of our economy (even though I just did). It's just my luck that I decide now that this is the most pressing issue in my life. I feel as if even in these hard times, people still judge you negatively for being unemployed.

Logically, I NEED to use the bus.  It'll save lots of money, both in parking and car maintenance... it's good for the environment... and I wouldn't have to deal with traffic anymore. Of course logic doesn't always play into it.

My big fear is just looking like an asshole when I try to pay, because I'm convinced everyone else on the bus is a ""pro"" and I'm going to screw up getting the dollar in machine, or it's going to get jammed and I'll be the idiot who made everyone late for work.  Plus, the bus driver will no doubt be a jerk and get mad at me for not knowing what I need to do.  Also... I'm pretty sure everyone on the bus will know each other, since they've probably been riding the same bus for a while, and they'll all be looking at ME since I'm the new guy.

Or course, since they'll all be looking at me and internally criticizing everything I do, there's a whole lot of OTHER issues I have to deal with.  Like... what if I choose a seat that someone else always sits in?  Everyone else is in their set pattern, and I'm going to come in and screw all that up and they'll hate me. Or... what if there aren't enough seats to sit in? What if someone tries to converse with me?  What do I DO on the ride... could I bring my Nook and read? Listen to music? Since my job is pretty casual, will they judge me if I wear a t-shirt and shorts? Maybe I should just wear polos and khaki pants from now on?

And you start getting all creeped out and then maybe you start noticing them back? Well I am that awkward person who begins that ugly cycle. Let me explain a little better.

I used to have some major SA problems, which have mostly faded due to cognitive behavioral therapy and exposure to social situations. It was probably all at its worst while I was in college. One of the things that was just unbearable was trying to sit through a lecture without the eye-drift happening. I would be sitting there trying to focus on the lecture, and for whatever reason -- something the professor said, a movement across the room -- I would feel my visual attention get dragged away from me. Usually I would just start watching whatever student was next to me, or sometimes a nearby student who impressed or intimidated me in some way. It's not like I would ever stare someone down, but I couldn't help noticing them during the lecture, just out of the corner of my eye while I watched the prof or took notes. If they ever noticed me noticing them, my anxiety spiked through the roof. I'm surprised I never had a panic attack. I even overheard someone mention it to their friend after class one day, so I know I'm not making this up.

Coping strategies in class:  Keeping my head down more frequently. Sitting against one wall of the room and using my long hair to block visual contact to the other side. Angling the frame of my eyeglasses to make it block the person sitting directly next to me. Eventually just stop going to class. This eye thing is no doubt a factor in why I failed so many classes.

Anyway, college is over (thank fuck for that) but I still go googly-eyed sometimes. For example, sitting next to people while watching a movie. There will be no anxiety trigger at all except lateral proximity to a person and the intention to focus forward. Or if I am feeling only slightly self-conscious in some situation, it might happen a bit, and then I notice it, which only amplifies the anxiety. Sometimes I can just will it to go away, which is awesome. But the real pain in my ass is that I have an acquaintance that caught me doing it to him in some awkward moment, and now I can't hang out with the guy because I keep doing it. O_o

I've never tried to talk about this before .... Do any of you have this problem? Any way around it? Do I need to go back to therapy or just talk to my friends about it? Why does this keep happening??? Thanks.

I believe I may have social anxiety or depression idk.I feel like ive missed out on so many things because of it and it makes me so angry to know that I can't just be normal and not care about every little thing that people might think of me.

Im crying as I type this because I just feel so pathetic. Im jealous about my cousins not because they're prettier than me but because they can have conversations with strangers and not blank out and panic after ""hello."" I work with one of them and shes always being greeted by our coworkers while when they see me I get that fake ""oh yeah hey..."" I feel like people think im conceited and dont wanna talk to them but in reality, I would love to talk but I don't know what to say. As ridiculous as this may sound, I wish I had learned how to dance just like my cousins did when they were little. You don't know how much I hate going to family parties or clubs knowing that ill be the awkward one standing around because im too scared to even attempt to dance with anyone.

 I feel like this ""fear of peoples opinions"" ruined my relationship with my ex as well. She was a very strong, opinionated woman who also had very opinionated friends and I just had no idea how to communicate with them. When she'd tell me we were going out with them I'd dread it sooo much because I knew id be the awkward quiet one in the group and it would make my ex very angry. I would try my hardest to talk to them but every single time I'd go blank. I couldn't think of anything to say to them and id freak out inside. I could tell they didnt like me because ""they felt they didnt really know me."" She would always call me out on it and I just didn't know what to say to her. Now she's with someone else and it really hurts me to see her posting all sorts of stuff on Facebook about them being all lovey dovey. She never took pics like that with me. She never really showed me off to the world. Im trying hard to be friends with her but having to hear her talk to me about her gf and how ""she did something similar to what you did"" just hurts. 

When she broke up with me she said it was because she wanted to start a family (shes a bit older than me) and now that shes with this new girl she says she doesn't want kids till later. Why couldn't she just tell me the truth that she was just bored of me and wanted to move on after almost 3 years. She always reminds me how I was so good to her, how our sex was amazing, how she'll be so jealous when I find someone else and why I haven't found someone else. 

I just feel so shitty. I feel like a loser who cant communicate with anyone. I love what I do at my jobs but I hate the fact that im gonna have to talk to people. Its not that I don't like the people I work with but more because again, I don't know what to say to them. I talk like 2 sentences with them and dont talk the rest of the day. I cant even have a decent conversation with my own mother. 

I spend all my time locked up in my room playing video games because idk what to do. I can go for days without talking to anyone and im fine but deep down inside I feel so alone, so lost, so angry. I know its time for me to seek some professional help but im just embarrassed. In my culture its wrong to go to the doctor and take depression medication. I mean im already judged by my family for being a lesbian. But anyways...I sincerely apologize for the long rant.

Sometimes I forget I have social anxiety but days like today just make me remember how inept I am and how I've never been able to have a normal life because of this stupid, irrational, yet so deeply ingrained anxiety. 

Today there was a big gathering at work. Probably about 30 employees, most of them I either do not know or have only met once. Everybody was drinking wine and schmoozing and laughing and hugging and I sat in a chair on the perimeter of the room. I was in awe of some of them, my mouth figuratively agape at how effortlessly they could command other peoples attention, make them laugh and smile, create conversation out of thin air, without creating any awkwardness at all. 

The only person I talked to was my boss, and I could tell she only talked to me out of pity. I can't stand the falseness that is most social interactions between coworkers or individuals who otherwise wouldn't interact if they weren't obligated to. I hate talking to people who I do not care about, and who likewise visibly do not care about me. I hate when they make big declarations of forced affection, like, oh it's SO good to see you! We're going to miss you SO much! We just LOVE having you here! All the while you know they are uncomfortable even speaking to you because of the awkwardness you constantly radiate. 

I just can't seem to make any basic conversation. My heart beats as if I'm running, my mind is absolutely and utterly blank, all I can do is feel--not think--and all I feel is supreme discomfort. All I want is to sink into the floor and disappear. I don't want to tell you my plans for the weekend--because I either have none, or my anxiety level is too high for me to remember them. And I don't care that you're cleaning your house this weekend, or that you're going car shopping. I really just don't. I *wish* I could, more than anything. I wish I had an ounce of compassion for others, maybe that would be fuel enough for me to think of things to say. Instead, when people talk to me it's like I've forgotten who I am, where I am, my name, everything. All I can draw from my mind is, ""oh cool."" When I'm spoken to, the only thing that enters my mind is blaring alarm urging me to get. the. fuck. out. 

How am I ever going to find a ""real"" job (one that wasn't handed to me out of pity) or make some semblance of human connection when I can't make simple interactions with coworkers who are perfectly nice human beings?

First of all, I am jobless right now. I am living with my girlfriend and her parents. They have been pushing really hard for me to get a job, But having SA it makes it hard for me to want to leave the house, dressed up and start applying places. Especially when it comes to having to do job interviews. God i fucking hate interviews. My soon to be father in law want me to get a job at a little store called Albertsons, I have applied there and had 2 unsuccessful interviews. But he keeps pushing me to apply there. I am just starting to get really over whelmed with this whole thing. My girlfriend (who has OCD, knows what anxiety is like) pushes as hard as her father does. I can't help myself, when it comes to them asking if i want a job, I lie and say no. But, in all actuality I just don't want to deal with the anxiety of the interview, meeting my new co-workers, building a relationship with said co-worker, etc. etc. IF i bring up the anxiety to her father he said (word for word) ""I've never been anxious in my entire life, Even in Vietnam when people were shooting at me! What that happened It just made me mad.""


Today My girlfriend and I were out sharing a cigarette, and she asks me if i don't care to earn her fathers respect. That actually made me red in the face, angry. This isn't a respect issue. It's an issue of anxiety. I don't have the comforts of a therapist that i can turn to, like  she does. I am not on medication like she is. I haven't learned how to deal with the anxiety that I have. It's starting to feel like I am not going to be good enough, I am now starting to get depressed because I can't support the child that we have together. I want to get a job. I don't want this anxiety any more. 


With in the past weeks I have been dealing with suicidal thoughts and dreams. All of this grouped with needing to get a job, barely being able to get out of bed in the morning, feeling like I am being talked down to, is all starting to get to me. I am at a loss for what I am supposed to do next. I just feel like everything is crumbling around me and I can't do anything but watch it all break away and fall into a dismal abyss.

However, if there is any area of knowledge that I feel the opposite, it is ecology and zoology.  While I may never be the most knowledgeable person in the world, I am confident that this is one area that I can never feel like a fool.  

Today I went hiking with my family at a local swamp, and I got a chance to actually feel like I knew something.  I was pointing out various species to my little brother, and at one point we came across a pond that had a lot of snapping turtles in it.  If you are not familiar with reptiles, snapping turtles have a very distinct appearance and they are not easily confused with any other species.  Also, given that I had just finished a herpetology class where the last unit we covered was turtles and we had gone as a class to this very swamp, I was 100% confident that these were snapping turtles and couldn't possibly be anything else.

As I was pointing out which lumps of mud were actually snapping turtles, a woman that I didn't know interrupted me and said that they weren't snapping turtles.  She had a very condescending tone and when I tried to explain that I knew what a snapping turtle looked like and I wasn't confusing it with something else, she brushed me off like I didn't know anything.  While I have gotten used to getting that sort of thing from my sister, it was something completely different to get it from a stranger that I wasn't even talking to in the first place.  

I'm not looking for any particular advice, I just needed a place to vent to.  If anyone has similar stories, feel free to vent them here.

I've done them before and had totally life-transforming experiences that resulted in a complete loss of social anxiety for about 3 months.  Those 3 months were some of the freest, happiest, most joyful months of my life.  I felt like I excelled at everything and things seemed effortless and fun.  I struck up conversations with people I met at the pond near my house on a fairly regular basis and enjoyed them all very much.

But at the end of the 3 months, I was getting back to my old anxious self, only worse.  I became reclusive and stayed home all the time, alone.  This lasted for a year before I checked myself in to a hospital for suicidal depression.

In the year since then, I've been slowly recovering, mainly in the last 3 months.  I go to support groups for my depression and see a psychologist and psychiatrist, and I'm on meds that seem to be working OK.

But I long for that feeling I had after tripping, where I knew that the world was generally a friendly, accepting place, and no one could hurt me emotionally without my permission.

On Friday, I felt I needed to get out of my house, so I went to my college's rec center, which is right next to the health and counseling center. Last spring term, I saw a counselor for my social anxiety and depression, but this was the first time I saw her outside of the office. I was walking down the sidewalk and am pretty sure she made eye contact with me, but I had no idea what to fucking do. The whole time I thought ""what the fuck do I do?"" If you run into a counselor, do you say hello? Do you not say anything? So, not knowing what to do, I avoided eye contact and pretended to not see her and now I feel like an asshole, because I feel I should have said something. 

Basically, minor shit likes this makes my life feel like an unfunny version of Curb Your Enthusiasm. I never know what to do in these situations. I mean, my therapist was really good, but I don't know if it would have been appropriate to say anything, considering almost everything we talked about was supposed to be in confidence. On the other hand, I probably should have said something, because I'm sure she spotted me. I have the same problem anytime I cross paths with a former professor or classmate. I feel like a jerk if I don't say anything, but feel like an idiot if I give them a nod or something and they don't respond. These are the insignificant little things that make me never want to leave the house (ironically, this is a lot of the stuff I used to tell my aforementioned counselor during our sessions).

I know people who freak out trying to give simple class presentations, or could never handle acting. However, often these are people who, from the outside at least, have friends and plenty of comfort with personal interactions.

Whereas, I've always been the opposite. I love public speaking, and presenting, and acting, as long as I'm prepared for it. Though I don't get nearly enough opportunities for it. I know what I'm doing, I say what I need to say, and then I'm done. I have my role, and I fulfill that role. I am in control. The few opportunities I've had to act, people really like me.

On the other hand, I have always been uncomfortable personally. I don't have an expected role. I could be anything, but there are a lot of things I don't want to be that I'll probably become if I say anything, so I am nothing. I can't prepare, and I can't improvise, because I don't know what I'm improvising about. I end up friendless and alone.

I've realized that if I can apply my experiences with public speaking and acting to personal interaction, I can start to improve. I think that's why subcultures are popular, because they give you a role to act in real life.

But what if the opposite were true?

Depression tends to cause you to focus on the negatives. So negative social interactions are really focused on and the more positive events aren't. But also if the individual is depressed then the dopamine production from social interactions might be compromised and they are not achieving a positive balance of what the world looks like. 

I feel like I've struggled with depression since I was 13. As I've gotten older I feel like it's gotten worse. Only recently did I really assess my life and start to question which one came first, the SA or depression. The whole ""chemical imbalance"" thing with the brain is a flawed model. But I do believe that depression can be a genetic thing that is entirely biological, and not just because of negative thinking. I believe the same could be said for SA as well.

I wrote a mini script/guideline for the call and drank a couple glasses of wine to get my nerves down, and, well, I was still a nervous wreck when I left a message. But I was relieved and so proud myself for taking that personal leap, and her response was amazingly understanding. I felt so hopeful for therapy, I couldn't wait. 


Unfortunately, she told me she had no slots open anymore, but of course she informed me about 7 other therapists in the area and gave me their numbers. That really crushed me hard. Probably since I built myself up so much and had myself set for her, and, after struggling so much to make one call to her, she instead returned with SEVEN other people to call. I suppose this is a typical occurrence, but I had no idea at the time that I would have to go through multiple therapists to see if one has a slot.

I thought I would be able to make the calls, but I just could not bring myself to do it. I don't understand why making phone calls is so nerve-wrecking for me, it makes me feel so pathetic. 

After that disappointment, I have since become immensely more depressed than I have ever been in my entire life, and I feel almost completely hopeless. I am not sure what happened. Just a few weeks ago I was ready to take a step out of my comfort zone to fix myself, and now I just feel like I'm already dead. I had so much hope, and now I feel like my bags are packed. 


I have never in my life been so depressed until the past few months (really not sure how I've made it this far), and now for the first I am having thoughts of suicide. I can't believe what has happened to me in these last few weeks alone and I have absolutely no one to talk to (and never have). My loneliness has never hurt me this bad. Last Monday I just broke down, drank a couple of beers and a full bottle of wine, intentionally broke the wine glass and cut my palm and arm for the hell of it, and then threw up in my toilet several times. I don't feel like myself anymore. 

Anyways, I just needed to post something because I feel like a lifeless shit and need to get some of this out. All I want is to somehow  regain motivation to follow up on those therapists, but I feel out of nowhere like I'm struggling for motivation to live.

I don't trust people that I don't know. Period. I know they're probably decent once you get beyond their personalities, but I've met very few people in my life that I would consider open-minded, kind, non-judgemental, and welcoming. As a result, I tend to be reserved when meeting new people. I can pretend to smile and exchange pleasantries. I can even go into interviews or certain social gatherings and pretend to be extroverted, but behind that smile, I'm just afraid and anxious. Just hoping that the person I'm talking to is not a cunt. So, that's where I am. I don't trust people that I don't know. I don't trust people that I haven't spent lots of time with where we've had deep conversations on everything from philosophy to science. Where I know them well enough to know that they are honest, caring people. But, I just can't help but feel that most people are judgemental and not able to put themselves in other people's shoes.

I'm currently a Freshman in college, and am really hating it. Last weekend I went home to visit and such. I met up with some friends and had a really good time. I should add, I took the train both ways, first time doing this by myself. I was surprisingly alright. Anyways, I got back, was feeling really good about myself, and actually felt social. Like I was talking to people, I wasn't worrying too much. It was great. So monday morning, I wake up to find my roommate gone as usual. (late classes ftw) I was getting ready to go take a shower. Now, we have a communal shower, so I always lock the room when I take one just in case. Except this time I don't know where they are. So I shrug it off and start looking. I tore apart my entire room, nothing. It just flat disappeared. So I start panicking. My keyring had my room and building key, my house key, my bike lock key, my safe box key, and a couple others on it. Gone. I pretty much just curled into a ball and sat on my bed. Eventually I went to get a temporary replacement, but I really couldn't bring myself to go to class. In fact, I've barely been able to leave the room, I only went to my pre calc class one day. I don't understand how I could go from feeling straight up good to barely being able to function. Why can't I just deal with this stuff like a normal person?

It's irrational, and I know it's irrational. I don't want to be negative but cognitive behavioral therapy seems more like tools for coping instead of addressing the true issue which is a subconscious belief that doesn't serve me. 

The way I see it is CBT, while I believe is effective, only addresses the surface. Those irrational thoughts and behaviors are coming from somewhere deeper. Correct me if I'm wrong but it seems that CBT's main focus is showing an individual how irrational their thinking is correct? And changing that. My last therapist I told outright that I know how irrational everything is, I'm well aware that people aren't going to insult me, laugh at me, or ridicule me, I know how absolutely ridiculous that is consciously. But my subsconscious is a different story, it doesn't know irrational from rational, it merely responds to how it has been conditioned over the years. I stumped him, he didn't know what to do. I don't take pride in doing that, I just wanted to show him how you can have both an irrational response and be completely rational at the same time.

I mean I've been in that situation during college walking through the halls and hearing someone laughing and what do I do? I immediately assume it's me they are laughing at. I tell myself no, that's foolish they are just laughing amongst themselves, but it still feels like it's directed at me. That's not normal, no healthy person thinks like that, that's a deep subconscious response.

So I'm gonna go to a hypnotherapist. If that doesn't work I'll give therapy a shot. To me it makes perfect sense and I figure it's worth a shot. The worst thing that happens is it doesn't do anything. It's like weeds, if you don't rip it out at the roots it will just keep coming back and you have to keep it at bay. That's not a good way to live life, there shouldn't have to be so much effort in performing such simple human interaction. 

If someone here has experience with CBT please don't hesitate to correct me. Maybe I just had a really shitty experience with a therapist and now I'm biased. Part of my social anxiety is I'm really sensitive, and when my therapist wasn't being sensitive to my problems he made me feel like it was all my fault and I was just being irrational. Anxiety was good he said, there's no need to have a problem with it. Fuck that, when people don't suffer from SA they have a really hard time understanding where you are coming from.

Prior to this I had done one, so this was my second trip ever with acid. I actually had a blast, limited social anxiety although not completely gone. I saw some amazing things and the whole trip was just surreal, like seeing the world through a pair of fresh eyes.

Now I'm going to say that while it was fun, I had to try very very hard to ignore the negativity within me, to not engage it. I came back from this experience with a better understanding of detaching myself from negative emotions and becoming the passive observer. I didn't dare venture into these emotions or thoughts because I knew I wouldn't come out of the trip positively. I know a lot of people say to confront your inner demons, but it's much better to do when not under the influence of a drug. I did that once on shrooms, I went to hell and back, it was the most terrifying thing I've ever experienced and it didn't benefit me in any way.

I feel a little better now that it's been a couple of days and my SA is a bit less, but I don't know how long that will last or if it's permanent.  Anyway I want to say that for me personally, the answer is not in psychedelic drugs. I believe these matters need to be addressed in a sober mind. I found that for the duration of my trip I was one step away from getting thrown into a bad trip. My feelings were amplified about 1000 times and I was lucky to be with friends in an amazing environment to keep my mind from drifiting to the negative.

Has anyone else done acid and noticed any profound changes in their SA or depression? I find that I'm able to handle emotions better, allowing them to be there and not becoming attached to them. So I did get something out of the trip, but this is only because I was thrown in the deep end so to speak. When you get confronted with all those negative emotions on acid it's either sink or swim. It just made me realize for most of my life it's like teetering on the edge and one thing can send me over the edge. It's still only 2 days after the experience, so the novelty of my perspective shift may wear off in a month or less.

If I don't, I'll explode. I've never opened up like this before, and I know that the only way I could do it would be over the internet. 

I am a 15 year old fairly liked girl who is often told by friends that she is pretty, smart, kind, loyal, etc. Every time I receive such compliments, I am filled with joy and gratitude for the kind people who surround me. Hell, I've even been called 'perfect' a few times. However, after a few moments, the joy fades and I am filled with sadness because I know that everything about me is artificial. 

It's not just the outside. Sure, I'm a bit insecure. I wear makeup. It's too a normal extent. Sure, I look at other girls and sometimes it makes me want to kill myself. I can be a green monster. But I know I'm beautiful. On the outside, that is. 

Here's a little bit of context : growing up, I've always imitated the people around me - the people I've admired. Whether it be a celebrity, a fictional character, or someone that I knew it real life... there was always someone that I was channeling, trying to become, because I envied the integrity of their personality. Personality was something that has always fascinated me : this fact is probably one of the reasons that I started writing novels and short stories, and plan on becoming an actress when I grow up. Plans for my future : my future works, my future goals, my future characters, all live in my head today. The personalities of the various characters I've invented all live within me. They are all me. Just the different parts of me split into a hundred pieces. 

Why am I fascinated by personality? Probably because I feel like I don't have one. 

I've always seen myself as an open-minded person : when I'm trying to break up a fight, it's extremely easy for me to step into everyone's shoes and see things from their point of view. When I'm acting, I can, without effort, put myself in the moment and believe I am feeling what the character is feeling. 
To put things shortly, I can, in the blink of an eye, become a completely different person. 
Most would see this as a talent, but I think my extreme open-mindedness has a major flaw : it's prevented me from having strict opinions on almost any given subject. I have several opinions that clash. I love and hate so many different things, all at the same time. It's very difficult to explain. 
Something that most of me hates, though, is the fact that I don't only act when I'm doing a scene : I do it daily. I know as a teenager I'm supposed to be discovering who I am, but the severeness of my case can and has driven me miserable. Don't get me wrong : I'm not depressed. Socially anxious, but not depressed. 
Anyways, as I was saying : I constantly feel like I'm playing a character. I play different characters for different people. I swear that for over a year I was being that kind, whole-hearted, innocent girl among my group of friends and coming home to write gory, sadistic stories that I would laugh cruelly at. I swear, there's a twisted girl inside of me that I can't get rid of. 
Most of the time it's not that severe, though. Sometimes I'll just want a teacher to think I'm shy - which I am - so I'll channel my shyness to a whole new level. Or maybe there's a girl that I want to like me - I'll channel by foulmouthness just to impress her. This is all about pleasing the people around me. As I said, I am socially anxious, and behind each persona is a fear of rejection. A fear of being hated. Talking to even the closest of my friends gives me extreme stress, because I overanalyze everything I say and fear that saying something wrong will make others discover what a boring person I really am. I mean, I don't think I'm boring... but others must do. Others have treated me like I am. Which is what has driven me to the point of automatically placing myself as the inferior being in any social situation. 

""How have others treated you?"" You may be wondering. Well, it started in the 4th grade when my best friend changes schools. I started hanging out with people who didn't really want me around - and things just got worse from there. I don't want to go into too much detail, but I can safely say that whichever social group I put myself into, I'd always be fighting for acceptance among people who ignored me, ditched me and replaced me with 'more interesting' people. 
This went on until the end of the 9th grade. Now, I'm in the 10th, and I've found better friends - ones that listen to me when I talk. I admit, having them look at me like they cared about what I was saying was a whole new experience for me. One that I don't feel like I deserve. 
Despite being happier this year, I for some reason feel like no matter how hard I try, I'll always be different from everybody else. 

It's funny, really - the friends who betrayed me were mainly the ones who would tell me I was gorgeous, smart, kind, etc. They're the ones that did it just to try to prove that they were decent human beings - when they really weren't. 
Kind? I only acted kind around them because I wanted them to think I was. Maybe I am. Maybe I'm not. Who knows. I don't even know. 
Smart? They were just a bunch of idiots. 
Gorgeous? Sure. If I'm so gorgeous... so smart... so perfect... then what was wrong with me, huh? Why did you humiliate me? Want nothing to do with me? 
If I'm all of these things, then why did everyone 'like' me, but not enough to get close to me? 
If I'm so perfect, then what the hell is wrong with me? 

I don't want to be a whiny teenager, but to this day no one has ever shown romantic interest in me, despite my alleged 'gorgeousness'. Sure, a person here and there might flirt with me for about five minutes, but then something - something pushes them away. The same thing that pushes people away from wanting to be friends with me. I don't know what it is. Maybe it's my awkwardness. Who knows? All I know is that I will always be different, and as my friends all get, lose, and regain boyfriends, I'll be stuck entertaining myself with the characters in my head. 

What's wrong with me? I'm still trying to figure it out. I have a very short temper. I'm emotional. I'm a liar. I'm pathetic. I'm impatient. 
My parents keep telling me I have low capability for empathy - that I have trouble making connections with people. That I can be quite heartless. Of course, they'd never think their perfect daughter could be a sociopath, because that kind of thing could never happen. Everytime their daughter voices that she doesn't think she has a personality, it's laughed off. I have no one to turn to. 
Of course, I don't think I am a sociopath - guilt and remorse have been the strongest emotions I've ever felt. Over things I've done that I won't name. I just think that there's something wrong with me. I'm trapped inside of a box. I'm gasping for air. I'm held back by fear. 

The point of this whole jambled text is that I don't feel like a person. I don't have a personality. I'm independent-thinking, yet I feel alone all the time. To top things off, I'm lonely. I want a relationship yet I KNOW I'm incapable of keeping one. I want to be social but I avoid socializing with people because it brings on me so much stress. Most of all, I'm different than everybody else. I repel other people. For reasons unknown. 

Once again, I'm not depressed. At times I feel like I can do anything; at others, that I am a complete failure. My moods fluctuate very easily, and I've gone through periods of great sadness, but I've never been depressed, and besides; all the pain had been concealable. Now, I'm not trying to be over-dramatic but, I don't know. I just wish someone could see through me. 
But of course, that won't happen and I had to let all of my feelings out on here. 

There is so much more to this story that I just don't feel like adding, but... I'm somewhat glad I was able to admit to this much.

I am now studying abroad(English and business in Canada), at first I came here with some friends that I knew from long before, so I had no problem going to school with them and with regular routine.

But now that they left and I am here alone(they decided to study here for just 3 months while I decided to go for 12 months), I can't leave my house and go to school and I have no idea why!

I wake up in the morning, get ready to go out and then something makes me not want to leave, some sick and irrational  feeling in my stomach, something that makes me not want to face people in the bus, in school, in the lunch time, etc.

There were days where I would shower, dress up and on my way to school, on the bus stop I would turn back, wtf...

I want to go out, I want to go to school, but I just cant... :(

It is making me sick, I've been lying to my parents(when I talk to them over skype) everyday, telling them I go to school everyday that my grades are good but I actually haven't gone to school in about 10 days, and this is happening for over a month, I go 1 day and then miss 6, 7, 10 days...

Anyway,
They just found out about it today(Someone from the school sent them a email) and I am feeling ridiculously miserable(just from thinking how sad my mother must be feeling right now, fuck), I haven't even slept yet. I never told them about my SA because they already worry so much about my alcoholic brother. I really didn't want them to be disappointed and worried at me too, especially because I always was the perfect son to their eyes.

I hope that maybe now that I told them about my SA I can overcome it more easily.

I'm 24, college graduate, trying to figure out what to do with my life, and only recently have acknowledged that I have social anxiety. In high school I was very shy but had a small group of friends to hang out with. In college I got involved in a lot of campus organizations that gave me a lot of friends. As in most of my college friends were introduced to me. This greatly improved my social skills but its hard for me to meet total strangers, especially cute girls. Now in the real world my old college friends are slowly moving on with their lives and I find myself losing friends now. This makes me feel lonely but I am trying to look at it in a positive light because it is forcing me to confront my social anxiety.

Anyways I have noticed that just acknowledging that I have social anxiety has relieved me a lot. increasingly though, my anxiety is pounding my head when I am alone or bored, usually both. If I can't focus on something like work, people to talk to, hobbies, etc. I start thinking almost uncontrollably about my anxiety which builds and builds and starts to kill my self esteem. One thing that really helps alot is going for a run. When I run I start to tire and it forces me to think positively so I can motivate myself to keep running. Afterwords I feel a total clearness of my mind and very relaxed. However I can't run all day and I do start to use running almost like alcohol (ex. I'll run before going on a date with a girl, even if it will cause me to be late).

A little background info: I'm 25 m and a recent college grad (graduated in December '11). I was diagnosed with SA back in 2007 and it's been a rough ride. I was seeing a shrink years ago but rather than helping me cognitively I was put on medication. My experience with most medication has been bad. It either hasn't worked at all or worked very mildly and caused more negative effects than positive effects except in one case. I was put on cipralex in 2009 and it changed my life for almost a year. Completely smashed my SA and I've never felt better. But over time it's effect started to wear off and I was back to where I started.

After a few years of doing nothing for myself I started an audio program in November 2011 for SA which I'm still in the process of finishing. I kind of feel like I'm taking psychology as a side study for myself. I've learned so much about SA and how our minds work and what exactly needs to be done to overcome SA. I've seen some progress and have had some really good days / weeks with the program. To give you a jist of it without going into too much detail there's an audio tape about a hour long you have to listen to each week and readings that are included that have to be practiced and read each and every day. Sometimes I spend an hour and a half reading these and putting them into practice.

The thing about making progress is that it constantly puts you on a roller coaster ride of emotion. You may feel great for a few days and then bad for another few which is understandable because I'm essentially trying to break up an irrational thought cycle that I've been using for the past 10 years. You're really supposed to see a relapse as a good thing because you can't have one if you haven't made progress. 

Anyways the last week has been a bit on the down side for me, every morning when I wake up it's a constant battle all day that leaves me tired, and mopy. I've turned down a number of interviews simply because I felt too nervous at the time. Being unemployed is also adding to the struggle. 

I'm not sure what to do at this point, I can't keep feeding off my parents and just moping around, and I also can't keep on fighting with myself forever. I'm tired.. ",,False,,t5_2r22n,False,,,True,t3_rym9p,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/rym9p/at_my_wits_end/,

A short introduction to my life: 

+ I'm at university

+ My friends are mostly from High School

+ I go to a gym

+ I work casual hours
 
My answers are mostly lies. It's usually some bullshit along the lines of: ""yeah, get a few drinks with friends on Sat, should be good"" or ""study"" (though the semester is over now). Reading, working on puzzles, trying new recipes and internet-ing is what I do, but I just cannot seem to say it.  
 
My friends have known me long enough, and are either equally introverted/misanthropic so it isn't an issue. When I do go out with them, I've no problem with them. The problem are acquaintances at work and at the gym; it's far more intimidating.  
 
I've tried just biting the bullet and being totally honest, but at the moment of (un)truth it falls through. I'm ashamed because it seems like a fairly harmless social ritual that I keep cocking up with these fabrications. I sometimes think I should just write up a 'social' life each week that I can rail off to these people.

""Functional"" isn't a word I would use to describe myself. I've only had two jobs in my life, quit both of them after a couple weeks, and my last one was in early 2006.

I took classes at a community college and university part-time from 2004 to April 2010, when I dropped out of university due to anxiety despite trying talk therapy and medication. I haven't been back in a classroom since then, which makes the idea of being around people in a work environment even more intimidating.

I'm 70 pounds overweight (6' tall, 250 lbs) and extremely self-conscious about it, particularly my chest (man boobs) and stomach. I wear a light jacket to try to cover up when it isn't ridiculously hot. I really only feel okay in a T-shirt while I'm out riding my bicycle, probably because I'm distracted and I feel better when people can immediately see I'm trying to lose the weight. I think about 50% of my dread about working is the idea of being around people for hours in a regular work shirt that doesn't leave much to the imagination. The other 50% is various social interaction anxiety, along with feeling a little hopeless about getting a job in Michigan, which has basically been in a recession for 10 years.

I've been trying to deal with the problem by losing weight, and I've lost almost 50 pounds so far, but it's taking a while, and I really want to start making some money. I've been living off food stamps, student loans, and the rent-free generousity of relatives for years, but my money is almost all gone, and my current living situation is a new low. In May, my mother, little sister, and I moved into the basement of the house my other sister is renting with her husband and three little kids, with a fourth on the way. The basement doesn't have separate rooms. I constructed a makeshift room in one corner using my packed boxes and curtains, but it doesn't afford much privacy or solitude. It's driving me nuts. I have to leave the house to get some peace and quiet, which feels totally backwards. At least it's some encouragement to be less of a hermit, but it's taking a mental toll on me.

I can't afford therapy or drugs. I think my best shot is to find places to volunteer so I can acclimate to being around people and maybe earn some references for a resume, but like weight loss, that will probably be a slow process. Any advice on how I can start earning some cash money soon? I really want to get out of this living situation. Maybe certain jobs where I don't interact with people much?

I managed to get a B.A. with occasional help of meds. Sometimes I would tell teaches of my SA and ask not to present if presentations had to be done (avoidance, yeah). Stuff like introductions where you go around saying your name at the start of a class was like walking into the gallows. 


Anyways, I'm back for a Master's and recently moved close to the school. Started classes last week and I thought through psyching myself endlessly and a good attitude I could manage talking in front of others or do what I had to do. If I got really nervous, whatever. I went to each class determined to embrace my fear, which worked OK at the start of the week. I learned the teachers are ALL about presentations here, and having us act as professional therapists even though we're students (I'm going for occupational therapy). 

Yesterday a teacher partnered us with someone to get in front of the class and talk about an assignment. Partner and I were the first ones (which I tend to prefer). I get up there, start reading off my part (it wasn't much, total of like 6 sentences). I was doing OK I thought but all of a sudden it fucking happened...got extremely nervous, towards the end everything turns into a blur and I'm not even sure what I said. Didn't read everything. Hands holding paper were shaking, making it worse. Throat tightens making it harder to talk. I manage to look up once to see a face. She was looking like she was trying to make out what the hell I was saying, which made it worse too. Partner does her bit, we sit down, I feel really embarrassed/ashamed. Can't look at the class. Every one else does their bit and no one breaks down at all like me. They look calm and at peace with themselves for the most part, many have fun with it even. They're confident. I feel even worse. You know the feeling? Wishing you could do that too? Making it look easy?

After class I go speak to the teacher at her office to see if she might have any advice for me (I thought she had mentioned in the first class having resources for anxiety, I was wrong. SA ruins my focus during class and I can't pay attention well). I tell her of my SA, and start fucking shedding tears. I just wanted to get it out there, hoping she might of dealt with this before and could help me somehow. I kept struggling to hold back tears, she was nice and helpful. Asked if I was getting treatment, I said no. She suggested I exercise and some other things. After we're done talking I get out of her office to the nearest bathroom and start fucking sobbing. 29 year old man sobbing. Wondering what I'm doing here, and if this was real. I felt the release of my ""dirty secret"" being out now that the class saw me freak (and I'll be with mostly the same people for the next 2.5 years, which makes me more nervous). I felt the tremendous burden of trying to hide this stuff from people over the years, and the impact it has had on my life in general. Went through many feelings/emotions. I might have a family by now, and be who knows what if it weren't for SA. 

Anyways, looking to start seeing a therapist/psychiatrist again (insurance sucks and don't have much money, so that will be tough). I've taken Klonoppin before which wasn't great, Xanax was alright. Any good recommendations? I've heard of beta blockers being good. I know we're all different and react differently to different meds, and the best person for advice is the psychiatrist, but just wondering. Any other advice?

I'm usually great when talking with people in small groups, and fantastic talking to someone one on one. I'm miraculously confident and charming when I talk with women. I'm just awful in larger groups.

Tonight is a good example. I was going to a friends birthday party at a pub where I was meeting one guy I knew, and about 8 I didn't know, plus a few girls. Beforehand, I ran into my ex and her friend. I was ridiculously confident, charming, I made both girls blush and smile and flirt. It was awesome. I was great with them.

Then I get to the pub and meet the other party. I knew my one friend, said hi to him and did an awkward handshake, then sat down. Made a bit of small talk to the guy across from me, and that's about it. I chatted awkwardly with other people once in a while. I kept thinking everyone was looking at me, wondering why I'm so quiet. I felt like I couldn't relate to anyone and never knew what to say. The more everyone drank, the more crazy everyone was and the more fucking awkward I felt. I would just say shit for the sake of saying it, and it just made things worse. I kept trying to think of how I should look so I'm not so awkward looking, where I should put my arms, how I should sit.

It's like something in my brain just switches on and makes me awkward as fuck. It's *extremely* frustrating, because I know how confident and funny and awesome I can really be.

I need help. I've had this problem my entire adult life and I need to put it to a fucking end. I'm so frustrated with it, I just have now idea how to stop it.

It means I get paranoid and super-anxious quite a lot. ""Does him being short with me today means that he hates me or just that he has a stressful day?"" ""Maybe they think I'm awkward and weird and would rather have me moving out?""
While I know that I'm very irrational about these things, I basically get the idea that they hate me a couple of times a week. When we do have cheerful and nice conversations it gives me such a relief, but only for so long. I'm completely consumed by what they think of me. 

Recently my SO has been staying here a lot, he is looking for an apartment. He hasn't moved in, doesn't pay me rent and I still see him as a guest each time. He does spend some nights at hostels or at friend's houses, but I suppose it's not superobvious since my room mates aren't home that often. So today one of them said that it felt unfair that he has lived here for 3 months without me discussing it with them first. I told them that we can try to sort it out, I can pay more for the bills since maybe him staying here a lot means higher electricity/water bills and stuff. I also apologized for making them feel like I've ""sneaked him in"" as a room mate. It hasn't been my intention, but I also understand why it could look like that. I also said that we could talk about him staying here less. 

Even though they've expressed their very reasonable concerns in a respectful and calm way, and I've shown them that I care about solving this and making them feel comfortable (we're gonna talk IRL about it tomorrow when everyone's home), I still feel horrible. I've done all I can but I still feel consumed by the fear that they secretly want to evict me and that they hate me. I feel completely emptied of joy, don't want to do anything, except wait for us to talk about it. I'm also terrified of that moment. I've taken anti-anxiety medicine but it only helps so much. I feel like a horrible human being who doesn't deserve to live here.

Anxiety started to hit me around middle school and in high school got to the point where I would feel dizzy when I was around large groups of people. I had a surgery at 15 and had the laughing gas before they did the IV to knock me out. As I was going under I had an intense panic and tried to open my eyes and could see the doctors standing over me and the surgery table lights then my eyes shut but my mind kept on. I kept seeing that same image of the doctors and light over and over again and I was convinced that my consciousness was stuck like this forever. I would never speak with anyone or do anything ever again, for all eternity I would have my thoughts and see this image over and over again. The panic was unbelievable I thought maybe my whole life had been a dream and this was actually reality, this terror this loneliness this image over and over. I was able to sit up and come out of it eventually and I told the doctors something was wrong they said everything was fine had me lay back down and I was out for good. When I awoke from the surgery the terror came back and I was convinced at any moment I could be sucked back in to that loneliness and no matter what I did the rest of my life when I died I would end up back to it. This terrified me beyond belief as no one knows what happens when you die and really the only thing I know is real is myself (I think therefore I am) all of you could easily be my imagination and then really all that there is is loneliness. For months, everyday I would wake up and that terror was there, that realization that this life could just be a temporary glitch in that emptiness and that I would return to it soon. It is a fear and anxiety that cannot be consoled and does not end. I have tried to look at it logically, that I had these feelings of loneliness beforehand and the anesthesia brought them out but having felt something so horrible I have found it impossible to completely recover. I think it is similar to living with PTSD. I have never really fully explained this to anyone and it feels sort of good to have written it down. Thanks to anyone who managed to finish it I'm sure its full of grammatical errors. Any comments, concerns, advice, similar stories would be greatly appreciated.

I can't pinpoint a traumatic event that triggered it and I don't know what it's like to be any other way. When I've seen doctors, they seemed to think that there must have been some specific event that triggered it. I think I was at least born predisposed to be socially anxious. It's a bit frustrating when doctors insist that there must have been some trauma when I've never not been socially anxious as long as I can remember. I can think of at least one event that could have made it worse, but I think I was most likely already anxious before it happened, and not only that, but it was an event that most people would get past easily and not even remember at all, so to me it shows that I was always very sensitive to judgment.

So what do you think? Is it really that impossible for someone to be born destined to be socially anxious? If you argue that as a baby you aren't socially anxious so you must not be born with it, what about people who are born gay? Obviously when you're a baby your thoughts aren't developed enough to know if you are gay or straight, so why can't it be the same with social anxiety and other mental disorders?

I wasn't as anxious on the meds, but I was still that awkward guy who wouldn't say much and when I would try to talk, I'd never have anything good to talk about. 

Since I've stopped taking these meds, I've been making it more of a habit of going to the gym. I don't just sleep all day like before.

I don't know where to begin really so I guess I'll just ramble.

I guess what made me write this now is that I'm just so miserable nearly everyday. Especially after any failed social iteractions, which are how the majority of interactions go. At the time of writing this I'm struggling to hold back the tears. Some days I just fall apart crying.

I've been shy for as long as I can remember. I can still remember back to when I was 4/5 and even then I had no friends and didn't talk to anyone outside of my immediate family. Now though it's starting to affect my life. I've been at uni for 7 months now and still haven't made a friend. I don't even know what some people look like who live in the same building. Even when I manage to actually talk to another human being I just can't turn it into a friendship or anything. Eventually the people that tried to make friends with me just get bored and give up. I don't even have online friends. I even struggle with posting things on the internet, I've basically had to work up the courage to post this.

If I do go out I just tend to pour as much alcohol down my throat until I don't care enough and will start talking to people. Before any of you say yes I know that it doesn't actual make you better at socialising or anything. If I do start talking without any alcohol, I usually start shaking (noticeably as some point out), my mind goes blank and I usually end up saying stupid stuff I would not even consider normally, I just blurt out anything. I can get really hot and sweaty, my voice goes shaky. I could go on forever. It normally just ends up with me being depressed after anyhow, even if I do have a good time, after I have analysed how badly I messed up every conversation and when I remember I said something incrediably stupid. Thinking everyone will be judging me, even though rationally I know they probably don't care or have enough time to judge me on every little thing.

I feel as though my shyness has also affected other aspects of my life. I pretty overweight and really want to lose it and get into shape, but I could never go to a gym or even go running while there are people about. I starting to struggle for the first time to study as well, even though all my life I have found it to come easy and have never got anything below an A. Earlier this year though I completely messed up some exams. Not sure if it is related but I do have a feeling it might be since I am also losing motivation as well because I just feel miserable most of the time.

The problem is though I feel I am just being lazy and taking the easy way out. I can't just be being wimp there has to be some sort of medical problem wrong with me. I have tried to talk to family and friends about it but I have trouble expressing myself as you might imagine and I don't want to worry them especially my family. The vibe I get though is that they just think I'm weird. So I guess I'm asking you lot, a bunch of strangers, if you think I'm just shy or there might be a deeper problem. Sorry about the wall of text.

Help please. ,omgmegannn,14,3,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/19dpxh/do_i_have_social_anxiety_disorder_help_please/,"Hi, I'm new to this subreddit and I feel like I've been dealing with social anxiety my whole life. I need to know if I'm just socially retarded or if I have a real reason to be. 


Around large groups of people, I am always quiet. When I have something to say no one ever listens. At school I'm always alone. In high school and my early years (I'm almost 23 now) I wanted to fit in and have friends. My first year of college, I was at a UC. I wanted to go out and party, make tons of friends, pretty much everything I felt like I was missing out on at home (my parents are Asian and extremely strict). Even as I tried, I felt like none of my room mates wanted to hang out or party with a person like me. I even pledged for a sorority but that ended badly. During my pledging quarter, I felt like I finally had friends and spent most of my time with them. My grades dropped and I got dismissed. Now, 4 years later I'm still at a JC. 


In college, I also started smoking marijuana. I still do at times, but a lot less. Sometimes I feel like that made it worse. My co-workers and boss think I'm quiet but I've channeled my emotions into work. I work hard because I care about what my boss and my co-workers think of me.


I've dropped many of my classes in JC because I felt like it was either too difficult, or I just couldn't handle it ... sometimes I don't even know why. That's when I realized that I quit on most of the things I start :(


I never feel like I'm good enough. I always say sorry and I am very passive. When some co-workers blame their faults on me, I even take it. Ugh, I hate it! 


I wish I didn't care what people thought of me. I wish I could say HEY! I'm me, whether you like it or not. I never see myself in a positive light so negative self talk is an everyday occurrence. I am very sensitive to criticism. And last and the worst part is, my social skills suck. 


I decided to post today because I felt like today was worse than most. I like to smile and smiled at some classmates today but they just looked at me. Did I do something wrong? I just want to be friendly and maybe make some friends. Recently I've learned to accept that I'm an introvert and usually just hang to myself. In previous semesters, some of my classmates try to study with me but I get so anxious! I would rather be by myself because that way, I won't have to worry about what they're thinking, or have to try and find things to say. And I saw another one of my classmates roll her eyes at me as I was walking by. Am I seeing things? Now I just feel even worse ... :(


**TL;DR**: I used to want to be outgoing and have friends, but now I've learn to accept that I'm an introvert. I know I have a lot to offer, but I'm keeping it all in. Should I get some professional help?


EDIT: Some formatting.

&amp;I forgot to add, I'm SO afraid to talk to people or speak in class because I'm scared of looking stupid, or saying the wrong thing, or making other people feel bad. My SO always tells me to stop worrying about what others think because no one is looking at me. I always try to take his advice, but it only lasts for so long. And I'm back to myself. I even posted myself on /r/amiugly because I feel like I am and he is always telling me that I'm putting myself down. I got downvoted because people thought I was fishing for compliments. I guess that's a good thing? I don't know. I'm just so confused and wish I had someone to talk to ..... sadface.",,False,,t5_2r22n,1362032955.0,,,True,t3_19dpxh,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/19dpxh/do_i_have_social_anxiety_disorder_help_please/,

Now, whenever I get an anxiety attack I grow super paranoid that the world is going to yell at me.  Doesn't help that my negative thought processes come springing back (loser!  no wonder you are virtually homeless, disliked by family and unable to even work a lame job like McDonald's?!

WARNING WALL OF TEXT INCOMING!!!! Anyways i think MOST of my SA started when my parents divorced roughly a year ago. I moved out of state with my mom, because i felt like i needed to look after her, and i didn't want her to be on her own. Before we move my grandpa gives my mom roughly $20,000 for the inheritance money he planned to give her when he passed away, but felt like now would be the best time. So we spent money like we had the lottery. But after 3-4 months we ran out of money. My mom kept pressuring me to find a job, which i did look but SA kept me from looking as hard as i could. 
  
We struggle by, and after a few months, my mom manages to find a job at a post office training center, which is pretty good money(11.40\hr). She gets me on as a temporary and i work there for a few months. This my second job after i left my home state, and i am glad to be working again, even if it is working with the public. After a couple of months, i am laid off from work because i was not a full time employee and they found another worker to fill my place. We fall into debt again, and we receive several eviction notices at our apartment.We manage to scrape by from money sent from friends and relatives, but continue to be threatened with eviction from our land lord. I can't help but feel responsible for the situation we are in, because i feel like i could have done more to prevent what has happened to us. I just can't get over the anxiety i feel every time i try to apply for a job.
	
One day my mom pretty much admits to me that she blames me for what has happened the last year. This really upsets me because before my parents divorce, my mother and i were very close. She really was the only friend that i had. So now I am wondering if it was all my fault for what has happened to us. My girlfriend (who lives with us as well) doesn't think it is my fault. She is also the only one who knows about my SA. 
	
I just feel like less of a man because i can't even take care of my own mother. My self esteem is completely gone, and i have become extremely depressed. My mom has decided to move in with her new boyfriend and told me that she pretty much doesn't want me to live with her anymore, and is kicking me and my girlfriend out to live back in my home state with my Dad. 
	
Idk what i am hoping to get from this post. I guess just to tell someone, and i'm sure i will regret posting this in the morning when i'm sober.I guess i just wanted to tell someone how i feel. My Dad is the kind of guy who holds in any emotion and i think i get my feelings from him. There is a lot i want to tell but i feel like what i have to say doesn't matter. I've been holding in 19 years of emotion and i know i need to tell someone how i feel, but SA and how i was raised has kept me from expressing how i feel.
	
I will be moving back to my home state in less then a month, but i know that my problems will continue. I need to tell my Dad that i believe i have SA, but idk how to say it. I am a lot like him, void of all emotion, and was raised to hid any feeling deep down inside. He is also an alcoholic, which does not help the situation any. I am hoping for a new beginning, which i know will not happen, because i already had that chance a year ago, and it did not turn out well.

Eventually i really want to join the Marine Corps, which i hope will help me over come my personal doubts about my self. I want to be able to do things on my own, without worrying if i will fuck something up. I want to be able to go out in public without worrying about what someone thinks about me. I have always had, (IMO), a pretty high self esteem, but i still have a doubt in my mind.

I have a lot more to say but i think i will end it here. I have to say, though, i know i wouldn't have posted this if i haven't been drinking. I really just need to tell someone how i feel. Anyways thanks for reading, and have a pleasant day.

Well we have looked at the data and listened to some feedback, and it seems that **a major hurdle for a lot of people is sticking with the course**. We know it works for the people that complete, and we know that people who don't drop out because it's not working for them (they still improve at the same rate as people completing), so we have tried to trim the fat and make the skills and techniques more accessible by reducing the number of weeks the course takes.

The course is still free and we are still taking feedback!

I went on my first plane today. Then I went on two more. I travelled a total of 3600 miles. Normally I would be in a big ol panic about something as big as this, but I was with my dad the entire time so I actually didn't have much anxiety at all. It was a pleasant surprise, really. It did suck on one hand though. 2/3 of the flights were at these massive airports. There were people. A lot of them. A big ol shitty parade of normal ass people. Everywhere. It just made me feel terrible. I had these 1-2 hour waits between flights, and during this time I'd just see so many people, having normal lives. Normal people, having normal talks. People crying as they said bye. Just fucking normal n shit. So much of it. I couldn't get away from it. I have never felt more out of place in my life. Seeing this reminded me of how I'll never be like any of them. It really hurt. My inner emotions shed a few tears. My outer emotions were fine because I was eating a quiznos sub and was with my dad so I had to act brave.
Moving on. So I flew halfway across Canada with my dad for work. I'm going to be up here staying with him for 6 months. We're in Alberta in case anyone was interested. I'd be semi excited for this. But man it's bad. He has 2 room mates, and the apartment is small. I'm staying in his room. One room mate came in 30 minutes ago. She started talking about a bunch of stuff. I didn't know what to say of course, so I casually drifted away. Before I got away, she mentioned how it's always hard moving up here. She said I just needed a few friends and it'd be fine. Wrong bitch. I need the exact opposite of that. Then she tells me her son is coming up later. Jesus CHRIST. I am so angry over this. I am dreading every second that passes by. Her son is just going to be here at any moment, I'm sure he's all hip and shit and probably a drug dealer. And I'm assuming we're going to be stuck together while her and my dad do shit. I literally am about to jump out the window. Why does this shit have to happen. Another thing. I'm too scared to go get a drink. I am parched like a son of a bitch. But I don't want to go out there and casually take something that I don't own. I'm just so uncomfortable. Idk how I'm going to eat or drink anything. I'm not going to be able to masturbate for a long time since I sleep in the same room as my dad. I'm going to have to be around 3 people every single day. Somebody come and kidnap me or some shit.
