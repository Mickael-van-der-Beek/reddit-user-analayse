Our explosive growth is due to your quality submissions. Our subreddit has more than doubled in the past 72 hours, surging from 2,200 to almost 7,000 subscribers!

Our goal is to promote informed discussion and debates about North Korea and all that surrounds it. Our focus is not just limited to the current military crisis but also to the broader cultural/economic/etc. aspects of North Korea. We would like to provide reliably sourced, up to date information to learn about North Korea.

We would like to issue a few simple guidelines for posts in /r/NorthKoreaNews:

* Links submitted to /r/NorthKoreaNews should be recent, reliable, and informative.

* Self-Posts are allowed, but are held to the same integrity standards as our regular news links. Self-posts that consist only of questions, opinions, speculations, and commentary will be removed from /r/NorthKoreaNews. Our sister subreddit /r/NorthKorea provides a more appropriate venue for such discussions.

* Keep discussions about links civil. Redditors are encouraged to ask questions of each other and to challenge each other’s points. Discuss the ideas to other Redditors; do not discuss other Redditors themselves.

* The Democratic People Republic of Korea (North Korea) is a totalitarian dictatorship with a record of systematic human rights abuses. The decorum in this Subreddit should be reflective of the human suffering in North Korea. Comments containing memes, degrading humor, and pop-culture references are not permitted.

Any posts violating these guidelines may be removed at the Moderator’s discretion.

Once again on behalf of the Mod Team, many thanks to all of you.

The only place you can find that quote, or anything like it, is in the Reddit headline, and the conspiracy-theory-based *investment* ""news"" post it links to.

The ""news"" link simply took snippets of different articles from other sources and repeated a few of them on a single page.

**Oddly, the quote about ""even if it is a test"" is thrown in the middle of the page with no link to a source.**

The source that it does point to has the following report:

- Japan has ordered its armed forces to shoot down any North Korean missile headed towards its territory, a defence ministry spokesman said on Monday

- “There is not a high possibility that the missile would target Japan, but we have determined we should prepare for any contingency,” a government source told Kyodo news agency.

This clearly says that Japan will shoot down the missile *only* if it is going to target Japan.

broadcasting is a mix of repeats of old footage .Some is more recent, and some is new.  Keep the link because they do go back and forth between coverage.

In a short space of time we reached 1000 subs and got a shoutout on /r/Worldnews, since then we have risen in numbers to over 2000. It's been great to see this happen. Thank you.

We feel that this subreddit should promote discussion and debates surrounding North Korea, not just with focus on the current military crisis but also the social/economic etc. aspects too. We would like to provide a place where people can learn about North Korea, and all that surrounds it, and be a reliable source of information. 

I would like to encourage people to ask questions of each other, challenge each others points but also to help post new content for our readers. If the popularity of /r/NorthKoreaNews stays on this positive path it is currently on, I'd like also to promote people to post documentaries and news reports on North Korea, even photography of people who have travelled there. This will only happen if people can remain neutral and have the ability to take certain things with a 'pinch of salt'. We will decide on this at a later date. 

Once again, many thanks to all of you. Please comment with any ideas and suggestions.

Yesterday their newsletter contained a (relatively brief) analysis of the situation in North Korea which may interest people here.

**North Korea: Comment.** The ***Daily NK*** contains two articles, based on reporting from contacts in North Korea, that describe the living and food availability conditions during the national mobilization exercises in progress.

They confirm that a partial mobilization of manpower has occurred since 11 March, unlike any in a long time. The only work teams still functioning are those devoted to goods for the armed forces. Production teams that make goods for civilians are participating in or are supporting the training.

Food allocations are based on production output by workers. Closure of a production line for military training terminates food allocations for the workers on that line. Mobilized workers are fed by the army but their families at home must fend for themselves or receive special allocations from the government or pilfered food from the army.

The contacts in North Korea report serious food shortages among the families of the mobilized workers, some of whom have threatened protests. In one major city on the China border, the government made a special allocation to avert a riot.

There are many hardships to living in North Korea, but food shortage is a category of hardship that has prompted public riots in the past that required troops to suppress. Government action to avert them by limited food allocations is an indication of the gravity of the internal situation. The leadership cannot afford to divert military resources to riot control when it is risking general war.

What the reports confirm is that the exercise is a high cost activity because no civilian trade goods are being produced and food is dedicated to the military first. The economic and social costs described in the articles indicate the exercise is more than just training. It is rehearsal and preparation for an action that risks a wider conflict.

The end of China's National People's Congress removes one powerful political constraint on North Korean decision making. The next two or three weeks require special vigilance because of the extent of the North Korean exertions already expended and because spring planting usually starts in April.

Edit: KGS NightWatch's newsletter from today (sent just now) does include commentary on North Korea. This focuses on China enforcing a *de facto* trade crackdown on North Korea. Perhaps more interesting is this observation at the end (though as ever bear in mind the problems with ""unconfirmed reports""):

&gt; Unconfirmed reports state China has sent aircraft and ground forces to reinforce its border with North Korea since the UN sanctions were announced on 7 March and placed border forces on increased alert. The extent of the reinforcement is not clear, but the reports indicate China has taken some extra security precautions against the ripple effects of an armed provocation.",,False,,t5_2wlaq,1363752288.0,,,True,t3_1an4yt,http://www.reddit.com/r/NorthKoreaNews/comments/1an4yt/kgs_nightwatch_states_costs_and_scale_of_nk/,

1363535072.0,8,self.NorthKoreaNews,1agu0z,Some things I would like to bring up about North Korea,michaelzelen,10,2,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/NorthKoreaNews/comments/1agu0z/some_things_i_would_like_to_bring_up_about_north/,"Hello there I wanted to discuss some things I have noticed from things I have watched about NK and some 'theories' I have that I don't think people bring up.

 (Please note, I am not a Military person so I have no way to view this in that sense, I just want to express these ideas and see if what whomever reads it has to say)

Many people look at NK's goosestepping armed forces with their old, old weaponry such as their Kalashnikovs and their armored units, some of which dates back to the 50s and 60s. Many people will scoff and say; well they (US) have drones as well as the best air force the world has seen and not think anymore of it. However I saw a [Vice.com](http://www.vice.com/vice-news/sofex-the-business-of-war-part-1) documentary that suggested otherwise, saying that NK has been buying one man helicopters that are able to be kitted out with a range or armaments (miniguns to missles). 

If this is what we (the public) can see with what they are doing, imagine some of the other stuff they could have that we don’t know about, note that in their gulags they have spread around the country, they conduct chemical warfare tests on the people imprisoned their, perhaps they drop some gas bombs on Seoul after some action on the DMZ 

Every NK Documentary I have seen mentions the power outages that occur all over the joint, originally the US (I think) was supposed to fund/build a small power plant to help alleviate this problem, but this did not occur. I'll come back to this.

I have read reports of the [Kim family fortune](http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2013/03/investigators-uncover-kim-jung-uns-billion-dollar-slush-funds/) and it seems to me that if I were any sort of rational head of state I would keep these sorts of funds a state secret and use them to my advantage, who is to say that may have built some sort of power plant using these funds, from where they come from I will address soon.

 Say this plant is up and running and is being used primarily for development on missiles and nuclear…stuff, they don’t supply the people with power as they can still focus electricity to hospitals and transport and don’t have to benefit as they are already used to it, if they haven’t had reliable power in the last couple decades then it is better to focus on other uses, the people lose nothing as they had as would only gain, and since they are used to these outages.

And as for the funds, I remember another Documentary that spoke to defectors and their life within NK, one man was a farmer and was ordered to begins farming a new crop and they didn’t tell him what it was, after describing it, it was discovered to be a opium or poppy crop, suggesting that NK is selling opium on a massive scale allowing the higher ups of the country to enjoy luxuries and afford minimal expense on the country at large due to the Juche (self reliant) philosophy that the state propagates. However have recently found that is it now more manufactured narcotics such as meth that they [seem to be producing](http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2011/06/19/north-korea-s-meth-export.html)

Thank you for reading, I hope you got something out of what this sleep deprived Australian could do at 3am, and hopefully you now know more than what you did before. Thank you again for reading
