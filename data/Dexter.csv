One was really popular (I believe someone was hired by Showtime to make some for the premiere), but now baked goods in /r/dexter have become an infestation. It's ridiculous. If you disagree, that's fine, but I'm pretty tired of bloody cupcakes lowering the standards of this sub. If the word, ""Dexter,"" wasn't slapped on them, they wouldn't belong here, and I contend that they still don't. It's not original anymore and it's time the fad was wrapped in plastic.

EDIT: Many of you have said that it's the offseason so random stuff should be fine and I should just ignore it. Here's my thing though- It's about quality control more than anything else. I think this self post has been successful enough to indicate a majority. Is it complaining? Yes. But if nothing else, it's validated as a common concern. I did not expect this to get so much attention, but at least that's indicative of a topic worth addressing, if not resolving.

EDIT 2: Wow, lots of hateful things going on here. I find it interesting that so many have come forward to complain about this post, as it's quite hypocritical. Regardless, it disappoints me that addressing the quality of a subreddit has been likened to oppression. With posts like this there's always complainception, where people complain about complaining about how complaining is related to the initial complaint. So let's skip that nonsense. Yes, downvoting exists for a reason. But in order to actually change something, it works better to be direct. That's what this is. Anyway, for those who have labeled me a ""whiny bitch"", thank you for contributing to the discussion, as it takes both sides to really get anywhere. I would, however, ask that you find a more productive way to express your distaste. If, as you say, all it takes is a downvoting, perhaps you should start there and see how that works out for you.",,False,self,t5_2rahc,1361810042.0,,,True,t3_195t6l,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dexter/comments/195t6l/rdexter_not_rbaking/,

Every single disc of the 4 disc set has a showtime ad at the beginning.  It can't be skipped, fast forwarded,  main menu button, etc.  No way around it at all.  It's basically a clipfest of every show they have going right now.  So we're forced to sit through ads of something we've already paid for.

Oh and the icing on the cake?  IT CLEARLY SHOWS A MAJOR FUCKING SPOILER FROM THE END OF THE SEASON OF DEXTER WE'RE ABOUT TO WATCH. Seriously?!?  They took like the last most intense scene from the last episode of the season and forced everyone who pays money for the DVD set to watch it, BEFORE they get to see the actual show! 

Shit like this is why people pirate.  I'm never buying another showtime show on DVD again. 

(I know that this specific spoiler is covered in the first book...and I had a feeling it would be adressed in the show someday.  But I had no idea it would be season 6.)",,False,self,t5_2rahc,False,,,True,t3_10rrab,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dexter/comments/10rrab/i_am_so_pissed_at_showtime_right_now/,

[Spoilers],Zombree18,399,56,80,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dexter/comments/136eq4/i_think_deb_has_the_worst_dating_record_in_tv/,"I know there's been a lot of talk about how fucked up Deb's relationships STILL are around the forum after the latest episode. I thought I might lay it out for anyone who may have forgotten the extent of how true this is.

Season One:

* She has a relationship with a guy who turns out to be married (Sean the mechanic)
* Falls in love with a the ice truck killer who then tries to murder her

Season Two:

* She meets Gabriel at a gym, then fucks everything up by being paranoid and assuming he is using her for his writing career.
* Starts a relationship with Lundy, who then leaves her for work elsewhere

Season Three:

* Starts a relationship with Anton, who was caught and partially skinned by 'the skinner'

Season Four:

* Lundy returns and the sparks fly, they rekindle their relationship, then they are both shot, Lundy dies

Season Five:

* She starts a relationship with Quinn, who then starts investigating Dexter behind her back.

Season Six:

* Quinn proposes, she rejects him and their relationship ends abruptly
* She then realises she is in love with her adoptive brother - goes to confront him, and finds out he's a serial killer.

Season Seven:

* Starts seeing Sal Price, who then gets poisoned and has a heart attack, dies.

If someone happens to find a link to a stream, link it here. Please do not ask for live streams. I will be removing stream request threads.

Season 1: Family: Dexter going through all his family issues with Harry and Brian Moser. Oh and SURPRISE MOTHERFUCKER.

Season 2:  Addiction and devotion: Dexter goes through his addiction to killing and how it feels to discuss it with someone else, Lila. 

Season 3: Friendship: Dexter undergoes the process of making a proper friend, Miguel Prado, a person he could depend on, something every human would need, but that doesn't go well.  

Season 4: I could really get this one, perhaps it may go around family and acceptance. What do you guys think?

Season 5: Another one I'm not so sure about, this one discusses motivation and moving on, after what happened with Rita. Thoughts?

Season 6: Religion and beliefs: Dexter goes through the normal human process of questioning what is out there. He meets Brother Sam who really gets him thinking. Then again with Harrison's Christian school he wonders what he should pass on to his son. Travis Marshall goes without saying.

Season 7: Love: Dexter (and his Dark Passenger) understand(s) real love upon meeting Hannah McKay; knowing that she isn't drawn to his darkness, like Lila, isn't blind to it, like Rita and isn't depending on it, like Lumen. Then again there's the Isaak being gay thing and Debra being attracted to her brother that support the theme of love further.",,False,self,t5_2rahc,1353652446.0,,,True,t3_13mxon,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dexter/comments/13mxon/season_themes_what_do_you_guys_think/,

THIS IS REALLY THE FINAL SEASON OF DEXTER!?!?

There is no sense of impending doom. There is nothing in the air with anything that remotely resembles ""final season of epic show."" It is already episode 6, only 6 left. I feel like this is just another season, and that the big finale is going to be such a cop out. Don't get me wrong this season hasn't been as bad as Travis Marshall, or Lumen, or fucking Miguel Prado, but its THE FINAL SEASON. For christ's sakes the show is still talking about PROMOTING A SERGEANT for Miami Metro. Do I care? No. Do you care? No. Does it have anything to do with Dexter? Probably not. Not to mention its between Quinn (idiot cop) and random new black chick that just popped up in the final season.

I don't get it. When I get excited for Breaking Bad's upcoming finale I get excited! There is a sense of a clock ticking, of danger immediately coming. I have faith that after the first episode when it comes back on air, I will maintain that feeling of immediate chaos. But in Dexter where are we after 6 episodes? Psychiatric help for brother and sister, Miami Metro promotions, Jamie having sex, Harrison lying about the TV remote, oh and the most important storyline of all; **Masuka's daughter may need some cash.** 

People I have loved Dexter from the beginning and always will. But after being a faithful viewer for 8 years I feel a little betrayed. The writing in Dexter has always been not exactly the best, but COME ON give us something. And I swear if they get this new Hamilton kid to ""replace"" Dexter once he's gone (Dead/Jail/On the run) I will lose my shit. He just looks like a Robin, to a Batman, but the writers aren't that horrible? Right? *....Right?***

EDIT: I did not expect my rant to blow up like this. For the most part it seems like people agree with me. Trust me guys I want this to be a good finale. I want Dexter, the show, to redeem itself.

Entirely appropriate considering Dexter's two conflicting identities - the killer and the unassuming. His ""Dexter side"" is the one that world see whereas the ""sinister side"" is the killer that only a few see. I truly hope this was the author's intent.

FAMILY: Trinity. Struggles to become a family man with another serial killer as his mentor. 

ALTRUISM: Lumen. Helping a woman get revenge against her rapists. 

FAITH: Brother Sam/Travis. Examining faith, purpose and the meaning of life.

- If Early Cuts corresponds with the show universe, he actually finished raising her after their parents died, instead of abandoning her for a life of debauchery or manipulating her into becoming his accomplice (which would've been the ""selfish love"" thing to do).
- That time in season 1 when he stopped the research of his biodad because it made Deb cry.
- He killed Brian to protect her, renouncing not only his ""true brother"" in favor of his ""fake sister"", but the freedom to be a serial killer without limitation and with an accomplice who would accept and encourage him, taking her instead into his home where she would disorganize his orange juice and take the bed every other night.
- He turned Hannah in to protect her.
- When she found out about him, not only did he not kill her, but he just let her go and... trusted she wouldn't tell anyone? He didn't even kidnap her, or try to scare her into not telling anyone.
- He also actually made an effort to go through with Deb Rehab and called her when he felt he was slipping. 
- He was gonna let Deb shoot him. Some people say he was manipulating her, but I presonally don't think so.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that Vogel is full of shit.

1324298193.0,213,self.Dexter,nifl1,"The Injection, explained -- air embolism not an actual danger",Ship_It_Dex,236,23,73,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dexter/comments/nifl1/the_injection_explained_air_embolism_not_an/,"There was a lot of confusion on this point, so I thought I would clear it up.  I was going to post it as a
reply to someone but then hardly anyone would see it, and it seemed like a topic of fairly general interest.

##1) What was in the syringe?

Air.

##2) Wouldn't that give him an air embolism and kill him?

No.  That's a cliche for films/TV with evil nurses.

First off, in reality you'd need an air bubble the size of a turkey baster if not several times that size.

Second, air bubbles *especially* aren't dangerous subcutaneously instead of intravenously.

Dexter is an anatomical expert, he obviously didn't inject his jugular or carotid.  Just some loose skin on
his neck.  It was subcutaneous (under the skin), not intravenous.

The real reason you try to get air bubbles out is for accuracy in measuring dosage, not because air bubbles
are dangerous.

##3) What happened to the M99, did he squirt it out first?

He didn't even HAVE M99 because he came straight from the play and Travis had stolen his bag with his
supplies.

You also need to handle M99 with gloves and not even spill it on yourself or have it absorb into your skin
through your damp pocket.  The amount of M99 you would want to squirt into your neck is not ""a teensy amount
left over in the syringe/needle"", it's ZERO.

He also did not shove it all the way through into his mouth and squirt it; it wouldn't reach, and if it did it's still orally active (like taking any opiate by mouth).  Instead of passing out immediately he might have taken some number of minutes and then not stayed out for as long, but this stuff is **potent**: 10,000 times as strong as morphine.

##4) Where did he get the syringe, then?

Anyone who NEEDS syringes (e.g. diabetics, serial killers) carries extras in the car, because the thin
needles can easily bend/break when inserting into a stopper (rubber seal on the vial) or flesh, or can get
pulled out when withdrawing from the stopper.  One in every N needles is just not glued in right.

This could have been in the glove, tire well, rolling around on the floor, or in one of his cargo pants
pockets or his car forensics kit.

##5) How did he fake it to look like there was liquid in the syringe?

With semi-transparent / cloudy plastics, it is very difficult to tell the difference between air and liquid
unless you put something directly on the other side of it and can see the magnification effect.

With small plunger stoppers it is easy to think you withdrew liquid when actually nothing came out because of a weak
vacuum seal.


##6) So did he pull the plunger back when he took it out of his pocket to make it look like something was in there?

He took enough time pulling it out that he could have; he used his other hand also, and even after that he
was obscuring it when he held it up so he could have done it at any point.

BUT he wouldn't necessarily have had to -- many syringes come partially un-plungered, pulled back slightly.
You have to push the air out that's already in there.

##7) If he didn't have any M99 with him, how did he inject Travis?

He got his bag back after he punched Travis out, and past kill kits have shown he prepares more than one
syringe when he goes into the field.  He might also keep an extra vial of it dry and reconstitute it because
it has a short shelf-life (~1 day normally).  If he used one of the syringes he prepared for the boat, it
might have degraded a lot, so the jab when he got home might have been an additional one for good measure.

##8) Where was his bag?

It was either the one Travis carried into the building (or inside that bag), or it was in his car.

##9) If it was in his car, how did Dexter know which one it was?

Easiest explanation: He took the keys from Travis's pocket and used the key fob to lock/unlock and sound the
horn.

Or, he remembered what it looked like, or he looked for cars with black duffel bags in them.

Downtown parking is a bitch so Travis had to park across the street and a block or two away, making the
first explanation the most likely.

##10) If he had extra syringes in his forensics kit, did he have extra M99 in dry form?

Highly unlikely because even unreconstituted it would degrade very quickly in a hot car.

Etorphine is a Schedule I controlled substance and its hydrochloride salt is Schedule II and only large
animal veterinarians should have it, so you wouldn't want to have to keep ordering it because you left it in
the car all the time.

Taking a small vial in his kill kit as a backup is more plausible because then he only takes it out of the
fridge overnight and puts it back when he gets home.


##11) Did Dexter plan it out ahead of time?

Unlikely.  He probably thought he could get the drop on Travis and knock him out by hand.

But he's also a creature of habit so he took syringes with him, even though they were empty, because he
ALWAYS keeps syringes in his pocket.

(There was also an off-chance he would find his stuff and who knows if the old syringes would be there,
undamaged.  If they weren't capped then the needles could easily get damaged with the kit bumping around in
the bag.)

Once he saw he could use it as a bluff, he went with it.  The whole thing WAS actually logistically
completely solid, they just didn't show all the details.

They probably went over the logistics of his syringes a zillion times in the first few years with
questions like ""what if he pokes himself in the leg through his pocket?""

If you watch closely he fakes the injection at first, just moving his fingers down but not plunging up, but I took that to be faked for TV rather than Travis.  The next angle shows it apparently plunged completely.  If you want to assume it was fully loaded and he faked it, then he had to get JUST the right angle to fake out Travis from a few feet away, NOT get even a little in his neck accidentally, AND he would have had to make an extra trip home to get some even though the eclipse was minutes away, when a brick or pipe would knock him out just as well.

IF he planned out the bluff, he could have used ethanol (what you normally dissolve M99 in) instead of air, except that would require not only betting on an unlikely strategy but that *Travis* would be the one to think of it and suggest it.  If Dexter just offered it straight out, it would have seemed really fishy.  Travis was *extremely* suspicious of Dexter and would be tipped off to the trick.  It could have reminded him of the kill kit in the bag, and then he might have made Dexter use one of the leftovers from the boat.


##12) Why didn't he just take the sniper rifle off the dead officer and shoot Travis in the back of the head before he even knew he was there?  Or at least in the but-tocks?

Because when your child's life is on the line, you should save them as dramatically as possible even if it
quadruples the chances that both of you are sacrificed to the Sun God with an ancient weapon.

##13) How do you know all this?

I'm a serial killer.


--------

**EDIT** Update:  Official explanation is Dexter brought a syringe full of M99 [but squirted it out surreptitiously](http://insidetv.ew.com/2011/12/19/dexter-finale-interview/2/), thanks **ginger-ale**.

This means it WAS supposed to be air, it WAS supposed to actually have gone into his neck (not a pretend injection), the bluff was NOT planned, so those major points match up.  It also means he either brings extra prepped syringes in his pocket or used ones from his bag kill kit, so that checks out too.

Unfortunately it brings up so many other logistical issues that, combined with the ones ALREADY existing, could fill a whole other article.  Just to BRIEFLY skim over *some* of them: Travis didn't know Dexter was alive, which means he walked in RIGHT when Dexter walked out.  How lucky can you get?  And he doesn't even SEE Dexter standing in the doorway 5 feet away, or hear him talking about Gellar's book and the witness with the sword.  Dexter doesn't see him either, and nobody else notices him putting on the mask, including the Nun 4 feet away at the foot of the table, the same one Dexter talks to seconds later in the other room.

Then despite being only *seconds* behind and in hot pursuit, Dexter shows up LONG after Travis who is taking his sweet time, so presumably he went home to get his M99.   The M99 is not only unnecessary because of the remote location, but going to retrieve it changes a hot pursuit and likely beating him there to *instead* gambling on being late not just for an ""appointment"" but his child's execution, and he is already gambling he knows exactly when it will happen and that it won't happen early.  (""Don't worry, I have the full hour!"")

Afterward, he has to get Travis down off the roof of an office building and into his car with a toddler in tow without anyone seeing him, including any security cameras all over the building that Miami Metro would obviously review.  Nobody gets there before Deb's group from HQ, despite crews on every tall building around.  Nobody calls building security, not even to order a lockdown or evacuation.  Not a single helicopter is standing by for a rooftop operation or possible car pursuit.  The officer, having secured the roof, does NOT secure the ENTRANCE to the rooftop.  Why not just sit there pointing the gun at the elevator?!  Instead, he's patrolling the perimeter looking for people who can... fly?

[Spoiler] for season 5,menomenaa,206,21,103,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dexter/comments/11ndc7/why_hasnt_dexter_brought_up_the_events_of_the/,"So in the last episode of Season five, Debra finds Dexter and Lumen killing Jordan. Out of vengeance. She lets them go. 

&gt;""I know who you are, Number 13. I know what they did to you. I've seen the tapes. I watched them over and over. It's a miracle you've survived, a f***ing miracle. And you (to Dexter), whoever you are, you know that too.

&gt;""Maybe it's true some people deserve to die, but I'm a cop and I don't f***ing make that decision,"" Deb adds. ""So I'm going to call this in and in an hour this place will be swarming with police. (beat) If I were you, I'd be gone by then."" 


Deb didn't know it was Dexter back there, but Dexter knew it was her. She clearly showed that she acknowledges murder is sometimes redeeming if you're killing the ""right people,"" she acknowledges that the law isn't perfect because otherwise she would have arrested them immediately. She acknowledges that murder isn't black and white. 

Wouldn't Dexter want to bring this up with her? Say ""hey Deb--I know you kind of agree because you've let murderers *like me* go--in fact, it was me! You felt bad for Lumen, so you understand that sometimes scum like Jordan deserves to die, and their killers aren't the evil ones in that scenario."" 

I'm just surprised how little conversation has happened, and how resistant the writers seem to be to talking about past seasons. Do you think it's because Dexter doesn't want to admit to more crimes than he has to? (Even though she's seen the blood slides...)

There are several things I thought they would have talked about by now:

**Dexter killing his brother** - I can't believe he hasn't told her, and she hasn't asked. Especially given her relationship with Rudi/Brian.

**Dexter framing Doakes** - Again, pretty obvious. His death totally doesn't conform with the code, and while it wasn't really Dexter's fault, Deb should still be suspicious enough to ask.

**Rita's death** - SERIOUSLY. Deb finds out that Dexter is a serial killer, and his wife was killed by a serial killer, but doesn't think to ask if there is a connection?

**Dexter helping Lumen** - Deb finds out that Dexter is a vigilante who kills other murderers, and it just so happens that she apprehended (sort of) and then let go someone who does the same thing last season. Amazed that Dex hasn't told her it was him behind that tarp, and that she hasn't figured it out. 

**Dexter being harassed by Louis** - No reason to keep this a secret. In fact, telling Deb could make the problem disappear.

**Who else knew/knows about Dexter** - No mention of Miguel, Lyla, Camilla, Lumen, Trinity's son etc...

**Dexter's interference in investigations** - She saw all the slides. Wouldn't she want to know who he killed, and therefore which cases at Miami Metro should not be worked on anymore? Dexter has figured out most of Miami Metro's homicide cases before the department has; Deb should be pretty pissed at that. Most are probably old cases but why hasn't Dexter told her he killed Victor yet for example?

I know that some of this is going to be addressed, but I have an inkling suspicion that a lot of it isn't. It's as if the writers don't want to bring up events from past seasons in case the viewers don't remember or care anymore. It's understandable that Dexter is a little reticent because it's in his nature, but Deb should be all over this stuff. It just doesn't seem like a normal reaction for her to simply accept that he's a killer, and try to ""detox"" him. Deb is a detective; she should be more curious than that.

I was so shocked by the moment and Deb's breakdown that I wasn't paying close attention.  Deb's sobbing, the somber music, the look on Dexter's face... I was so overwhelmed by the moment that I wasn't paying attention.

I rewatched it and something jumped out at me.  In a different thread, someone said that in that scene, part of Deb died.  What's left is Dexter's now.  As if the good in her died there.

Rewatching the scene, when she's sobbing on LaGuerta's corpse - as she looks up and sees Dexter, she sobs out an **""I hate you.""** at Dexter.

http://youtu.be/ugM9ao7-OwY?t=2m21s

It's as if we're watching the good in Deb die in that moment.  And Dexter can see it.  And that good person, that person who was so torn, tells Dexter she hates him before she's fully *his*.

However, after the revelation Travis all of a sudden is full-blown evil and willing to do anything.  I wish they had continued with Travis struggling to accept what he was doing.  It seemed like his mind was inventing Gellar to cope with it but then they just stopped using Gellar at all.  In the end it feels like there was no point to the character at all.

None of these on their own is enough to raise suspicion, but cmon, altogether its laughable. Its horrible writing and insulting to the audience. Please feel free to add to this, as I'd really like to compile all of these to reconsider whether or not this show was truly ever ""great."" Please also feel free to shoot down some of them or to explain why someone wouldn't be suspicious.

* Doakes' S2 obsession with Dexter
* Quinn's S5 obsession with him
* LaGuerta's belief that he is the BHB, followed by her death
* The Trinity Killer killed his wife
* His neighbor gets murdered
* Him and Prado become BFF and then Prado disappears
* Quinn basically knows Dexter killed Liddy
* Emerging from the water near the Lake of Fire tableau
* Dexter happening to be at the donut bar the Koshka brotherhood decide to shoot up.

Edit: To clarify, it just seems like Dexter is always in the middle of things, and the cops who have been around the show long enough (especially Batista, and possibly Quinn [unless we accept that Quinn turns a blind eye because Dexter saved his ass S5]) should realize this.

1376361206.0,141,self.Dexter,1k92q9,"Okay, so I really loved season 8 at the beginning, but I feel something has gone terribly wrong.",xfilmmaker,179,38,94,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dexter/comments/1k92q9/okay_so_i_really_loved_season_8_at_the_beginning/,"Wow. Just.....wow.


So I just finished watching the newest episode of season 8 and I'm shocked at how far the season nosedived. It made all the wrong moves. Everything I was hoping it wouldn't do, it did.


Let me explain. [I loved the beginning of season 8](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dexter/comments/1hzk87/only_2_episodes_in_and_this_season_is_already_one/) 


The show felt sharp and back to it's darker roots. Deb's downward spiral, the new revelations of Dexter's origins and Vogel, all made it seem that this season was going to be a thrilling FINAL season. 


So now lets talk about where it all went horribly wrong:

**Zack**: I don't think I've ever disliked a supporting character so much on this show. Not even Lila was this bad. Zack is not a likable character. He's a punk. A douchebag. He's not sympathetic, nor is he a cool protege. He's completely forgettable and completely distracting. And he shouldn't have made it past his first episode. He shouldn't have even been in a episode. It feels like he INTRUDED in on the final season. The idea of him taking on Dex's job sickens me. Season 1 Dexter would not have put up with him at all.  He doens't belong here. His story is not compelling and we've seen it before. 


**Ruining Vogel**: Vogel....such an interesting character. She was like Dr. Frankenstein at the beginning of the season. If Harry was The Dark Passenger's father, she was undoubtedly his mother. Now, I truthfully can't stand her. I hate how she's becoming nothing but a stiff character who loves to say the word ""psychopath"". It bothers me a lot that she keeps defending Zack. ""Oh, he's just a boy"". Zack has killed two people now. He doesn't deserve to be alive and his story doesn't deserve to be eating up the final season. Vogel is keeping Zack and consequently his storyline alive, which is really hurting this season.


**Hannah/Miles**: Hannah's back, which I honestly don't mind, but her Miles story line was a pointless distraction. Instead of wasting time on him, it should have been focusing more on Dexter himself and the conclusion the show should be working too...but it doesn't even feel like the show is moving towards a conclusion.


**I mean come on, it's the FINAL SEASON**: This is not just another season of Dexter.....so why does it feel like it? Where's the sense of urgency? Where's the sense that it's all coming to an end? This is the final season, why is it just meandering. It started off with so much potential. Dexter's past came full circle. Deb was on a dark spiral, I was hoping it would lead to Dexter's true self being revealed, maybe he would go on the run....SOMETHING, ANYTHING...but now Deb seems to have recovered mostly. This season needed to do something BIG. 

Look at Breaking Bad. The final 8 episodes have started and it feels like the FINAL episodes. There's a sense of ""Wow, everything is really coming to an end. So many things are in motion all leading to the conclusion"". Where is that for Dexter?



I hate being the type of person who just complains.....but damn this season just took a nosedive for me. Last night's episode was my least favorite episode of the entire show's run.",,False,self,t5_2rahc,1376361801.0,,,True,t3_1k92q9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dexter/comments/1k92q9/okay_so_i_really_loved_season_8_at_the_beginning/,
1376040514.0,141,self.Dexter,1k0mas,Do you know what happened to Doakes in the book? Would you have preferred it? Includes details about one of the creepiest criminals that never made it into the show,twocats,179,38,78,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dexter/comments/1k0mas/do_you_know_what_happened_to_doakes_in_the_book/,"In Dearly Devoted Dexter I read about the creepiest serial killer I've ever encountered in a fictional work and what he does to his victims beats any other killer from the show by far.

**SPOILERS AHOY!**

In the books, Doakes doesn't die, but I bet he wishes he had died. He was captured by the killer and this happened:

&gt; As Doakes flopped about I could see that his right foot was gone, as well as his hands and tongue. Chutsky had said his entire lower leg had been removed all at once. The Doctor was obviously making this one last a little longer. And when it was my turn—how would he decide what to take and when? [...]  And he put down his pencil and picked up a saw, and as Doakes bucked wildly against his bonds the Doctor sawed off Doakes’s left foot, just above the ankle. He did it very quickly and neatly, placing the severed foot beside Doakes’s head.
 
For a dash of horror, I suggest you read how they discovered the first victim of ""the Doctor"" and what Doakes' fate would have been if Dexter/Debra hadn't saved him. Long wall of text coming up, worth every second. I found it extremely fascinating.

**A TON OF SPOILERS FOR WHOEVER DIDN'T READ and INTENDS TO READ THE BOOKS:**

-----------------

“What have we got?” Deb asked him, holding up her badge.

The cop shook his head without looking at us and blurted out, “I’m not going in there
again, not if it costs me my pension.” And he turned away, almost walking into the side
of a patrol car, rolling out the yellow tape like it could protect him from whatever was in
the house.

Deborah stared after the cop, then looked at me. Quite frankly, I could think of nothing
really useful or clever to say, and for a moment we just stood there looking at each other.
The wind rattled the crime-scene tape, and the dog continued to howl, a kind of weird
yodeling sound that did nothing to increase my affection for the canine species. Deborah
shook her head. “Somebody should shut that fucking dog up,” she said, and she ducked
under the yellow tape and started up the walk to the house. I followed. After a few steps I
realized that the dog sound was getting closer; it was in the house, probably the victim’s
pet. Quite often an animal reacts badly to its owner’s death.

We stopped at the steps and Deborah looked up at the cop, reading his name tag.

“Coronel. Is this lady a witness?”

The cop didn’t look at us. “Yeah,” he said. “Mrs. Medina. She called it in,” and the old woman leaned over and retched.

Deborah frowned. “What’s with that dog?” she asked him.

Coronel made a sort of barking noise halfway between laughing and gagging, but he didn’t answer and he didn’t look at us. I suppose Deborah had had enough, and it’s hard to blame her. 

“What the fuck is going on here?” she demanded.

Coronel turned his head to look at us. There was no expression at all on his face. “See for yourself,” he said, and then he turned away again. Deborah thought she was going to say something, but changed her mind. She looked at me instead and shrugged.

“We might as well take a look,” I told her, and I hoped I didn’t sound too eager. In truth, I was anxious to see anything that could create this kind of reaction in Miami cops. Sergeant Doakes might very well prevent me from doing anything of my own, but he couldn’t stop me from admiring someone else’s creativity. After all, it was my job, and shouldn’t we enjoy our work?

Deborah, on the other hand, showed uncharacteristic reluctance. She glanced back at the patrol car where the cop still sat unmoving, head in hands. Then she looked back to Coronel and the old lady, then at the front door of the little house. She took a deep breath,
blew it out hard, and said, “All right. Let’s have a look.” But she still didn’t move, so I slipped past her and pushed open the door.

The front room of the little house was dark, curtains and blinds all pulled closed. There was one easy chair that looked like it had come from a thrift shop. It had a slipcover that was so dirty it was impossible to tell what color it was supposed to be. The chair sat in front of a small TV on a folding card table. Other than that the room was empty. A doorway opposite the front door showed a small patch of light, and that seemed to be
where the dog was yowling, so I headed that way, toward the back of the house. 

Animals do not like me, which proves they are smarter than we think. They seem to sense what I am, and they disapprove, often expressing their opinion in a very pointed way. So I was a little bit reluctant to approach a dog already so obviously upset. But I moved through the doorway, slowly, calling out hopefully, “Nice doggie!” It didn’t really sound like a very nice doggie; it sounded like a brain-damaged pit bull with rabies. But I do try to put a good face on things, even with our canine friends. With a kind and animal-loving expression on my face, I stepped to the swinging door that led to what was obviously the kitchen.

I shrugged, pushed open the door, and stepped into the kitchen. The upper half of the room was painted a faded, greasy yellow, and the lower half was lined with old, blue pinstriped white tiles. There was a small refrigerator in one corner and a hot plate on the counter. A palmetto bug ran across the counter and dove behind the refrigerator. A sheet of plywood had been nailed across the room’s only window, and there was a single dim lightbulb hanging from the ceiling.

Under the lightbulb was a large, heavy old table, the kind with square legs and a white porcelain finish. A large mirror hung on the wall at an angle that allowed it to reflect whatever was on the table. And in that reflection, lying in the middle of the table was a . . . um . . .

Well. I assume it had started life as a human being of some kind, quite probably male and Hispanic. Very difficult to say in its present state which, I admit, left even me a bit startled. Still, in spite of being surprised, I had to admire the thoroughness of the work, and the neatness. It would have made a surgeon very jealous, although it seems likely that very few surgeons would be able to justify this kind of work to an HMO.
I would never have thought, for instance, of cutting off the lips and eyelids like that, and although I pride myself on my neat work, I could never have done so without damage to the eyes, which in this case were rolling wildly back and forth, unable to close or even blink, always returning to that mirror. Just a hunch, but I guessed that the eyelids had been done last, long after the nose and ears had been oh-so-neatly removed. I could not decide, however, if I would have done these before or after the arms, legs, genitals, etc. A difficult series of choices, but from the look of things, it had all been done properly, even expertly, by someone who’d had plenty of practice. 

We often speak of very neat body work as “surgical.” But this was actual surgery. There was no bleeding at all, even from the mouth, where the lips and tongue had been removed. Even the teeth; one had to admire such amazing thoroughness. Every cut had been professionally closed; a white bandage was neatly taped to each shoulder where arms had once hung, and the rest of the cuts had already healed, in a way you might hope to find in the very best of hospitals. Everything on the body had been cut off, absolutely everything. There was nothing left of it but a bare and featureless head attached to an unencumbered body. 

I could not imagine how it was possible to do this without killing the thing, and it was certainly far beyond me why anyone would want to. It revealed a cruelty that really made one wonder if the universe was such a good idea after all. Pardon me if this sounds a tad hypocritical
coming from Death-head Dexter, but I know very well what I am and it is nothing like this. I do what the Dark Passenger deems necessary, to someone who truly deserves it, and it always ends in death—which I am sure the thing on the table would agree was not such a bad thing.
But this—to do all this so patiently and carefully and leave it alive in front of a mirror . . . I could feel a sense of black wonder drifting up from deep inside, as if for the very first time my Dark Passenger was feeling just a little bit insignificant.

The thing on the table did not appear to register my presence. It just kept making that deranged doggie sound, nonstop, the same horrible wavering note over and over. I heard Deb scuffle to a halt behind me. “Oh Jesus,” she said. “Oh God . . . What is it?” “I don’t know,” I said. “But at least it’s not a dog.” ",,False,self,t5_2rahc,1376076530.0,,,True,t3_1k0mas,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dexter/comments/1k0mas/do_you_know_what_happened_to_doakes_in_the_book/,
