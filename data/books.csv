1374114063.0,2701,self.books,1ij56l,[Mod Post] We have decided to ban direct images and memes from this subreddit.,KarlyPilkoids,4698,1997,536,http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ij56l/mod_post_we_have_decided_to_ban_direct_images_and/,"We have had a long day discussing the future of this subreddit among ourselves and with the community, and we have come to a decision. Moving forward, we will not be allowing direct image posts or memes on this subreddit. This decision reflects our personal views as moderators and the views of many members of the community who expressed their opinions today and in the past.

Our vision for this subreddit is to be a hub for general discussion about books, and image posts make that a difficult standard to meet. It takes a very minimal amount of time for image posts to gain upvotes, since they are easy for users to consume and vote upon. This has made it difficult for discussion threads to make it to the front page for a long time, since images rise much more quickly. Banning them will hopefully promote more discussion based posts to make it to the front page.

Banning memes was an easy call to make. In a community based around books, it would be duplicitous behavior to on one hand promote provocative discussion, while on the other hand allow for low-brow, easy to digest image macros. This was also an easy decision to make because it was expressed vehemently by a lot of comments in today's thread, and in many threads in the past.

An important distinction that I wish to express is that we will still allow for image based posts, however they will have to be posted in self-posts. They will also have to include elaboration, and will be deleted if they do not promote discussion. 

Many users have asked us to make this sub self-post only, and we have discussed that as a good possibility. However, that would be analogous to treating this issue with a hammer. Our approach is treating it with a scalpel. Articles, reviews, interviews, and many other link posts are very supportive of discussion, and if you look at our front page on a regular basis, you will see that links like these make up a large amount of the upvoted content. 

We have seen a lot of people voice concern about the future of this subreddit. Let us prove them wrong.",star,False,self,t5_2qh4i,False,star,,True,t3_1ij56l,http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ij56l/mod_post_we_have_decided_to_ban_direct_images_and/,moderator

This post linked to 10+ ""Top 100"" book lists from sources such as TIME magazine, Entertainment Weekly, Modern Library, etc. They were all in such different formats, and such different ways of being presented that I wanted to amalgamate all of these into one master ""list"" in order to compare them (thirteen lists in total since I also added in the first 100 of the Reddit's 200 favorite books). I have since thrown this into a [pdf file on Scribd](http://www.scribd.com/doc/155522409/13-Top-100-Book-Lists-Put-in-One-Place) if anyone is interested. My next step was to compare each of these and see what books are most recommended in top lists. I omitted two lists (100 most influential books ever written and 100 Major works of creative nonfiction) since there was VERY LITTLE overlap between the other lists which were primarily fiction. I made one giant list that combined 11 ""Top 100"" Book Lists. The 
complete table, again available as a [PDF on Scribd](http://www.scribd.com/doc/155522309/Combined-List-from-11-Top-100-Book-Lists) lists all the books I'm the left hand column and all the lists along the top. An 'X' denotes that the book was included in that list regardless of position. The books are sorted vertically by the number of lists in which the book is included. 


If you don't want to see the entire lists, a quick summary is shown below. The top 26 (those that were recommended by 6/11 lists or more are:


* Catch-22 by Joseph Heller - (10/11 Lists)
* Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov - (10/11 Lists)
* The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald - (10/11 Lists)
* Invisible Man by Ralph Ellison - (9/11 Lists)

All great books, but we all knew that already. So here is my list of other must reads. None of them are all that obscure, but they're all really great books for one reason or another. 

I'm adding some stuff to the original list, like whether the book is a series and how many and stuff, just to clear up confusion

Edit: 2:30pm OK I'm going to go back and edit this so it looks like less of a mess. 


*A Town Like Alice*- Nevil Shute (My favorite book ever. The one I would pick to save from a burning library) (wow I could not have spelled his name less correctly)

*Salt*- Mark Kurlansky

***The Thief* and *The Queen of Attolia*- Megan Whalen Turner** Edit: seems like no one else has read this one. Seriously, one of the best books I have ever read. It's sort of an ancient Greek fantasy heist story espionage thriller. *The Thief* won a Newbery Honor but *The Queen of Attolia* is where is gets REALLY awesome. READ THEM. It's a series of currently 4 books, 5th is on the way

*The Third Policeman*- Flan OBrien

*Revenge*- Stephen Fry

*Band of Brothers*- Stephen Ambrose

*All Creatures Great and Small*- James Herriot

*The Twenty One Balloons*- William Pene Dubois

*The Painted Veil*- Somerset Maugham

*Stardust*- Neil Gaiman

*The Princess Bride*- William Goldman

*Cuchulain of Muirthemne*- Lady Augusta Gregory translation

*The Penderwicks*- Jeannie Birdsall (series of 3)

*The Piano Shop on the Left Bank*- Thad Carhart

*Shopgirl*- Steve Martin

*An Unsuitable Job for a Woman*- PD James

*The Daughter of Time*- Josephine Tey

*To Say Nothing of the Dog*- Connie Willis

*Sabriel*- Garth Nix (series of 3, 4th on the way)

*Dealing with Dragons*- Patricia C Wrede (series of 4, another series just arrived, *Thirteenth Child* and *Across the Barrier*)

*The Hunt for Red October*- Tom Clancy (give it a chance, it's really good!) 

*The Squire's Tale*- Gerald Morris (series of 8 or 9) **OK has no one else heard of this guy?** Do you want to laugh till you piss yourself? Ok then, go read Morris.

*Now, Voyager*- Olive Higgins Prouty

*The Last September*

*Asterix and Obelix*- Goscinny et Underzo

*TinTin*- Hergé

*Flashman's Lady*- George MacDonald Frasier (series of many)

*Good Omens*- Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman (the audiobook is also good)

*Swallows and Amazons*- Arthur Ransome (series of many)

*Danny Champion of the World*- Roald Dahl (did you know that there's a movie? With Jeremy Irons and his son, Sam Irons? SO CUTE)

*Tinker Tailor*- John Le Carre

*The Devil's Dictionary*- Ambrose Bierce (best bathroom book. I keep a copy in our WC for the amusement and edification of guests. Speaking of which, look up the definition of Guest)

*The Ordinary Princess*- MM Kaye

*Catwings*- Ursula le Guin (series of 4)

*Mr Revere and I* (also *Ben and Me* and *Captain Kid's Cat*)- Robert Lawson

*Carry on Mr Bowditch*- Jenny Latham

*Redwall*- Brian Jaques (also the Redwall Cookbook if you're really looking for a giggle) (series of many many many)

*The Reluctant Dragon*- Kenneth Graham (yes THAT Kenneth Graham, also look for the audiobook read by none other than Boris motherfucking Karloff. It will make your life better, I promise) 

*Kenny and the Dragon*- Tony Diterlizzi

*Basin and Range*- John Mcphee

*Circles*- James Burke (seriously awesome, go check it out NOW) (now that I think about it, this is one of the reddit-iest books ever, if redditism can be called a thing)

*The Right Stuff*- Thomas Wolfe

*The Shadow Series*- Orson Scott Card (ignore his personal politics, these are actually interesting and very good page turners)

*The Boat that Wouldn't Float*- Farley Mowat

*Apollo 13*- Jim Lovell

*Billy Budd*- Herman Melville

*The Wolves of Willoughby Chase*- Joan Aiken (also *Nightbirds on Nantucket*)

*Tomatoland*- Estabrook

*Trickster's Choice*- Tamora Peirce (depressed_realist reminded me of Peirce. All her books are good, but the Alanna series, the Wild Magic series are EXCELLENT and the best ones of all are *Trickster's Choice* and *Trickster's Queen*. But you kind of have to read Allana first, or they won't be as good)


And Finally

**The Grey Seas Under** by Farley Mowat, which I think is the best book ever written. And of course the sequel, *The Serpent's Coil*. 



Everything by the following authors:

Terry Pratchett

Dorothy L Sayers

CS Forester

PG Wodehouse

Christopher Moore

Bill Bryson (Especially In A Sunburnt Country)

John Mortimer

**OK I added him!** Mark Kurlansly!!

Neil Gaiman

James Burke

Arthur Ransome

John Le Carre

Susan Cooper (She's most famous for *The Dark is Rising* but also check out *The Boggart*. And let's all just pretend that movie never happened.)

**Edit** I'm off to work after a glorious two days off so I'll be collecting a whole new harvest of books. I'll post more tonight. See you in a few hours folks.

Now a major motion picture/or now a new HBO series? 

 I understand it's marketing reasons, but a book should stand on it's own as a good book. As books are often better than their adaptations... The quote that states the difference ""between books and movies is that in books the pictures are better"", really resonates with my feelings on this.

I mean if I haven't seen the movie version or series or heard of the book, I feel as though my imagination has been robbed, because no matter how hard I try I'll only ever see the characters as they look in on the damn cover.

Edit: Well I'm off, (for now) 3+hrs in the same discussion with you all has been mostly awesome, but time for work... Thanks to all here for sharing your opinions. :)

Edit 2: wow... a sneaking back to reddit and I find more comments to read through, again thank you all for including your own opinions.

I have no time to reply to them all, but I will add that again that I am happy that these covers get people to read. I really just wish we could find better ways. 

Also that I know that the covers in no way change the book, but there is something to be said about books that use an artists rendering to sell the book or the skills of a layout designer with the art in their typography. If you see no difference in seeing a cover that is beautifully illustrated by an artist and one just slapping cast photos on it, well that makes me quite sad. Yes it is all marketing, and packaging, but there is a difference.  

Lastly using the movie cover is just another advertisement for the movie, and we have enough of them everywhere else. Is it wrong to not want to be bombarded in yet another place? We turn on the tv we see mostly ads, so we go for a drive and see ads on the freeway, we turn on the radio and get more ads, so finally we go to get a new book and there again we find advertisements on the book covers.

Also special, I was using a Valentine my dad got in grade school as a book mark. 
I've called the lost and found at AA but they said it was long shot. I realize this is an even longer shot, but I figured I'd try. If anyone finds it, PM me. I will forever be your best friend.

Pictures and details inside.",huacas,2100,534,413,http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1eqmcv/500000_books_need_homes_pictures_and_details/,"Hello reddit, this post is about Carrie and her books. Carrie is the owner of Once Sold Tales, a book store 10 miles south of Seattle. Times have not been good to bookstores and Carrie is closing her store. She currently has about half a million books that she wants to find homes for. 

Because housing all these books is now costing more than she or her business can afford, Carrie is left with few options. If nothing is done, she will have to pulp all books left unsold. While there are many pounds of books, nobody wants that.

I know reddit is (rightly so) critical of help requests. Money is not the goal of this post, rather, Carrie wants to get people reading again. If you live in the Seattle area and want to visit her warehouse, here is where you can find it:

22442 72nd Ave S, Kent, WA (Google maps link - http://goo.gl/maps/NQUYk )

Here is her website: http://www.oncesoldtales.com/ where you can order something to get shipped out.

Here is a photo album: http://imgur.com/a/WnlQU

Carrie will be operating her website and selling books at the warehouse (1$ for paperbacks, 2$ for hardback, or 1.50$/lb) until the end of May. If she can afford to go a bit longer, she will. She is going to be offering reddit a special deal if there is interest. I'd be lying if I said the idea wasn't mine. Details are still getting worked out but it looks like 10 dollars for 8 books or 18 for 16. Details forthcoming as well as how to actually make the order. (price includes all taxes and shipping for continental US, so the plan goes atm)

(EDIT: Product being offered to reddit is a grab-bag, I don't believe titles can be chosen, most likely general categories. Please comment on what you would be looking for or what structure you think would work best)

(EDIT2: More details for the grab bag are being requested. Specifically kids books. Since they are way lighter and the bag pricing is dictated by shipping costs (there is really little overhead sadly) a kids books selection would have way more books. No clue on specific. Stay tuned)

(EDIT3 The reddit grab bag is  not live yet. Purchases from the site are full price and there is not yet the opportunity to buy things super discounted online. Please, be patient, I am working with Carrie to get the electronic side of things figured out. I promise I won't leave people hanging)

(EDIT4: I'm a moron. Thats pretty standard, but there is a Facebook page. www.facebook.com/OnceSoldTales )

(**EDIT5**: There are too many responses! Holy cow, and I thought I could reply to everyone :/. I need to get some rest, I have a job to get to in the morning, but I WILL be back and I WILL have more answers to more questions. This includes shipping internationally, options to donate money/books, and of course specifics for the reddit grab bag. Goodnight reddit, thanks for helping Carrie find a home for her books)

FULL DISCLOSURE: I used to read books all the time and when I found out about what Carrie is going through, I wanted to help. I'm not getting paid and I'm not an employee. If you think my photos are a little too good, thank you! I am a hobbyist photographer and appreciate the compliment. If you think they suck, let me know why (might as well get better at it). Carrie is hard to get a hold of, but I will do my best to help answer questions, update the post with as much info as I can, and pass along anything you would like me to.

Her class consists of mostly freshman boys, and I thought Ender's Game would be a good book to get them interested in reading. Unfortunately her kids are pretty low on the pecking order so it's very hard to get school funds directed her way and she can't get a classroom set of books.

If any of you have an old copy of Ender's Game (or any other books you can spare for that matter) laying around you can donate she would really appreciate it!  

Also, if you have any other suggestions of good books that might get this demographic interested in reading she'd love to hear them.

Thanks!

Please send any books to:

El Cajon Valley High School
1035 E. Madison Ave.
El Cajon, CA 92021





**TLDR: Wife teaches the ""Dangerous Minds"" class at her high school and can use any old books you have laying around - especially :Ender's Game"".**

EDIT: Her class is 20 kids (so I just need 20 copies)


EDIT: Thanks for all the upboats! I think we may have enough Ender's Games - but any extras she gets will be donated to the school library and any other random books you send will be much appreciated (and hopefully well read ;)

EDIT: Front page! Fact - Redditors are awesome.

EDIT: I'm positive my wife (and all the local libraries) just got enough Ender's Games - however if you still would like to help these kids out there are a lot of fabulous suggestions for different books by other Redditors in the comments:

The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian by Sherman Alexie,
Monster by Walter Dean Myers,
The Giver by Lois Lowry

**A big Thank You to all who commented and upvoted. My wife came home from work today where she had one of ""her worst days ever"" with fights, death threats, etc. and I showed her this post and she was moved to tears reading all your comments and seeing such generosity. So thanks again (you made me proud Reddit).**

Users in the comments, however, pointed out that the image was watermarked, and that the user who posted it had made other posts in the past referencing and/ or advertising for the very same company. 

As evidenced by the amount of upvotes and positive comments the post received, this post was seen favorably by the majority of subscribers that saw it. For that reason it was a difficult decision for the mods to delete it. 

This subreddit is regularly used as a medium for marketing, whether it be through spam, blogspam, bots, or direct sale links. You may not see very much of it, since most of it gets deleted by either the spam filter or by the mods, but if you are a regular reader of this subreddit, chances are you have seen some. The mod team defines spam as anything that aims to sell or promote a user's own work, and while the post in question was directly doing neither, it was watermarked and it was posted by a person with a vested interest in the image. 

Letting one promotional post slide sets a precedent for other promoters on this subreddit, therefore I believe that it was in the interest of the community that the mod team delete it. 

Promoting you own work is tough, and it is definitely great when users post original content. However, there is a thin line between sharing your work and advertising for it. When you are telling stories or posting examples of your work, that counts as sharing, and is a wonderful thing for a community such as this. But when you are watermarking images, and posting discount codes and sale links for your website, that becomes spam.

It makes me so happy to see him getting to experience one of my childhood favorites for the first time.

Edit:
For everyone giving me a hard time for supporting a bigot (among other things) here is a quote frome Neil Gaiman:

""If I were only allowed to read or enjoy art or listen to music made by people whose opinions and beliefs were the same as mine, I think the world would be a pretty dismal sort of a place."" 

While I don't agree with the author, I can enjoy his work. You of course have the right to not support him. But please don't try to force your oppions on others.

So please instead of negative comments try posting about sharing your love of books with someone you love. That is what my post is about after all.

Edit 2:

1352740110.0,1341,self.books,132ivr,12 Books You Could Read That Might Change Your Mind,sartorialconundrum,1818,477,388,http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/132ivr/12_books_you_could_read_that_might_change_your/,"So, people like to make lists; more importantly, they also like to criticize lists and fight over them. This is why lists are always the books one *should* read, or books that *you must read before you die* or the *Top 50 Books of All Time*. However, these lists are geared this way because it makes it easier to argue about a list, and to criticize it, not because it makes the list any more helpful. It's hard to argue with just a plain old helpful list. After all, there are many reasons (good or bad) to dispute whether Dickens deserves to be on the Top 50 All Time List (see my comment history), but it is nearly impossible to dispute a list that merely wants to be a list of *books I have read that I think you all might enjoy if this is your sort of thing*. This explains a lack of this kind of list: we can't fight over a list like this, and if we can't fight over something then why talk about it at all?

However, this might be the most needed kind of list. After all, if I am looking for a good book I don't need a list of the best authors of all time. I already know who Shakespeare is, and I have already rejected him as a candidate for my next reading adventure. What I need is a list of books that are *also good*, but not typically very well known. This means that a list like this cannot, as a matter of first principals, be a list of the best. 

So, this list will have the dual advantage of being helpful, and will generate a less argumentative response. So, without any more rambling on my part, I give you: **Sartorialconundrum's list of twelve books that might help you change the way you think about things**. 

The idea behind this list is that each of them take a different view than the established ideology in their field, or they take on a myth that we have come to take for granted in our way of thinking, or they are stories that don't quite follow a traditional character arc. The books cover politics, history, science, economics, literature, and journalism. 

* The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, by Thomas Khun.
* The Golden Bough, by Sir George James Frazier.
* The Assault, by Harry Mulisch
* The Skeptic, A Life of H.L. Mencken, by Terry Teachout.
* America's Great Depression, by Murray Rothbard.
* The Republic, by Plato.
* The God of Small Things, by Arundati Roy.
* Financial Reckoning Day, by Bill Bonner and Addison Wiggin.
* Selected Poems, by Ranier Maria Rilke.
* Lanark, by Alasdair Gray.
* Orlando, by Virginia Woolf. 
* The Dangling Man, by Saul Bellow. 

Everything is this list is a little off. Some you might never have heard of (Lanark), others are lesser-known works by well known authors (Orlando). Others are monumental works, but in a field you might not be acquainted with (how many people in here are well-versed in Anglo-American Analytic philosophy?). One is a lesser known poet from Bohemian Paris that most people don't read because his contemporaries out-shined him (Rilke). One is a recent bestselling novel that I chose because the author looks at her heritage differently than any other author I have read (Roy). One novel treats tragedy differently than most would (The Assault), while another deals with ambiguity in modern life (The Dangling Man). 

If you are looking for something different, I recommend any of the above. 

Regards, Sartorial Conundrum.

**Edit**: As one comment corrected me, I accidently wrote down the blog name instead of the book title. Financial Reckoning Day is a literary/historical approach to economics/investing, The Daily Reckoning is the blog that came of it. 

**PS** I am glad this got such a good response. I would like to see more of this collaboration. Arguing over what is in the canon is boring. Talking about books is not boring. 

Lastly, I promised an explanation for why I recommend all of these books, I.E., how they changed my mind. Right now it is late, I am tired, and I have a bottle of Dewars. I will leave the exegesis for tomorrow.

I look at them before I start reading, to get a general idea of the shape things are going to take in my head, then I (vaguely) fill in the blanks as I'm reading, usually not thinking about the locations spatially at all. She constantly references the map while she's reading, to get an exact idea of where they are in relation to where they've been or referenced cities.

You read a book and the culmination leaves you so drained (in a good or bad way) that you don't have the mental energy to pick up another book for a few days at least.

**In a bad way** - The most recent example for me was *The Wise Man's Fear* by Patrick Rothfuss.  In my view, the plotline completely jumped the shark, introduces several *deus ex machinas* and completely changes the protagonist's character.  I feel the storyline has been completely ruined in a blatant ""ratings"" grab or desperate attempt to fix the storyline.  [This review](http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/38361485) summed it up pretty well for me.  My apologies if this is a popular book and my opinion disagrees with yours.  The effect left upon me, though, had me drained and lexically listless - I will probably be able to read once more in a week or two, when the sourness wears off. 

**In a good way** - When I finished the Foundation series, I stopped reading for a few months.  I kept thinking about the Foundation universe and didn't want to read books for fear of the 'taste in my mouth' being spoiled.  I had also, just for a few days, lost the motivation to eat or drink.  I was also slightly morose that the author hadn't written any more books.  But then, even 20 books in the series wouldn't have been enough.  It was much after this time that I bothered to learn *about* the author, and explore more of things he had written.  (I was a fool and didn't know that Asimov was a famous person).


---

I am interested in hearing if a book has had any kind of an effect on you and in what way.

There's nothing wrong with enjoying crap, but at least have the self-awareness to admit that it's crap you're enjoying.""",MichaelJSullivan,1622,537,659,http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/14nw8i/the_fact_that_you_like_a_book_or_that_it_sells/,"The above was a comment made a few days ago on a review that is nearly a year old.  The book was my own debut novel and to say the reviewer didn't like it is an understatement as she said,  ""Thanks to my broad experience and lack of discrimination, Theft of Swords isn't, quite, the absolute worst book I've ever read. But it loses the prize by a very, very slender margin.""

I never responded to the review (it's always a bad thing if an author does) nor did I ask any of my fans to do so (but nonetheless several who have liked the book did), and there was a kind of flame war that ensued.

I'm not upset with the reviewer (I've grown a thick skin and I realize that everyone has their right to their own opinion) but the review itself and this comment does bring up an interesting point.

After being profesionally published for nearly a year and selling more than 150,000 books I'm considering the series a success, because I can attach objective (not subject to opinion) criteria to it.  But to judge a book ""good"" or ""bad"" is, at least to my mind, a rather futile exercise.  There is no universal criteria that all readers, critics, and literature professors can agree upon to separate ""good"" from ""bad."" And I don't think the opinion of a reader bears more weight if they have extensively studied 'literature.""  But there seems to be an almost pavlovian response by some people that say if a book is popular, it must automatically be crap.

As an author I think trying to determine my book as ""good"" or ""bad"" is folly.  I'm more than satisfied with the fact that the vast majority who have actually read it were entertained and found it a good investment in both their time and money.

So I'm really hear to ask the people in /r/books - do you think books can be classified as ""good"" and ""bad"" or is it really just a matter of which books fit your reading prefernces and which do not?",discussion,False,self,t5_2qh4i,False,disc,fantasy,True,t3_14nw8i,http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/14nw8i/the_fact_that_you_like_a_book_or_that_it_sells/,

Edit: That being said is there a [criterion](http://www.criterion.com/) type thing for books? 

Edit 2#: I went to my second hand book store and found a copy I liked for a good price also the [book depository](http://www.bookdepository.com/) had the same stuff for good prices. 

Also, obviously it doesn't change the content of the book, but for the price you end up paying for books I like to be able to marvel at the cover because it dedicated to the book. Also I like nice things.

Edit 3#: I should make it clear in my example, that this is certainly a book I've read before, I just didn't own it. I like collecting books that I love and I'm always happy to pay for an edition I find appealing. (Which has never been the movie version) Like a lot of readers, I tend to have a backlog of books that I'm intending to read so there is never any rush to get it into my hands. In any case, agree or disagree, it is all about opinion and it is a hard thing to argue but I've really enjoyed reading all the comments so far.

But there are a hundred other posts actually about books on this subreddit that are getting no attention maybe go give them a read too. This was just a quick post while I was browsing for books.

1257185653.0,1075,self.books,a08cm,Looking for something to read? Here's a messy collection of book-recommendation threads on reddit. ,,1231,156,64,http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/a08cm/looking_for_something_to_read_heres_a_messy/,"Hi /r/books

I've been adding these threads to my list of saved links now and then, so it's far from a complete list. There are probably plenty and plenty of omitted book recommendation threads in other subreddits. I have - for instance - nothing from /r/programming, and not much else from any smaller subreddits. So if you know of a good book recommendation thread for, say, cooking-books or something else topic-specific but yet of potential interest to readers then feel free to share and I'll add it to the list.

Much of the recommendations in the posts below don't really differ that much from thread to thread, I guess. I'm willing to wager that all the ""life-changing"", ""mind-blowing"" and ""must-read"" threads probably list ""1984"" or ""Brave New World"".  But one might still fish out something new or old of interest.

Anyway. Confused? Lost? Looking for something to read? Well this here is nothing awesome or professional, but you might find it of some use:

So I came here to look for some help in converting a nonbeliever.

Too often her thoughts reflected my own. Just like Esther, I have my whole life ahead of me, full of potential- I should be excited. Instead, I can't help wondering, what is the point of it all? Esther's emotional struggle so closely relates to my own. And then I realized, she's crazy. Or at least having some sort of an emotional breakdown. And if I'm not careful, I could quite easily allow myself to follow in her footsteps. This was quite sobering. 

So, r/books, what have you read that hit a little too close to home?

EDIT: Two things. First, I love how books can have such profound impacts in our lives and serve as mirrors to our souls. Especially when it reflects things we've been trying to ignore. Second, I think 2udaylatif summed it up well: ""It is not surprising to find similarities in ourselves with characters in stories. That is what makes them so enthralling.

1329124043.0,845,self.books,pna7r,My rules for reading. What are yours?,,1264,419,648,http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/pna7r/my_rules_for_reading_what_are_yours/,"These are my rules for reading. I don't always follow them, but I certainly do my best to try. I transcribed this from the first page of my reading journal:

1. Don't tell others how to read. Some people like to read 100 books a year, others like to read just a few--there's no wrong way to read. Your *Ulysses* may be another person's *Twilight*, and there's nothing wrong with that either. If someone was moved by reading *Twilight*, that's a good thing. There's nothing more elitist than looking down on others for not having the same taste as you.

2. Reading is just a medium; it's not better than other mediums. I read because I like using my imagination, and I feel reading does a better job of describing things. That does not mean that other mediums do not lend themselves to intellectual thought and analysis. After all, films and television have someone writing them, they've just chosen a different medium to deliver their thoughts.

3. Write in the margins. There's so much you don't get when you're not doing this. As well, it's wonderful to be able to see what you were thinking as you were reading a book. It's enlightening to see how your thoughts on a book changed since the last time you've read it. If people are like you, they'll enjoy reading your notes as much as you enjoy reading the notes of others.

4. Read books you love more than once. People who say that there are far too many books in the world to ever spend the time rereading a book don't seem to realize that they will die before they have read every book in the world anyway. You'll probably die before you read every book on your bookshelf. If you love a book, read it again in a few years to see if its meaning has changed. Also, reading a book more than once really allows you to get the subtleties that you didn't pick up on the first round.

5. Don't worry about what you're supposed to get from the novel, or how others interpret it. If you get something entirely different, that's perfectly fine. You bring your own life experience to the table when reading. Worrying about these things is just a distraction from your own experience with the book.

6. However, be interested in the perspectives of others. In every book you read there are things that you missed. Discussing books with other people can be really enlightening. They bring their own experiences to the table as well--experiences you probably haven't had. Many a ""wow"" moment has come from having someone point out a theme in a novel that you've entirely missed.

7. Partake in easy reading every now and then. Tom Robbins, Dean Koontz, Stephen King, Christopher Moore, Chuck Klosterman, David Sedaris, and so on. Reading Faulkner, DeLillo, Joyce, Wallace, Gaddis, and other literary works all the time can be depressing. Sometimes you just need a good laugh.

8. If something sucks, move on. You're reading for enjoyment, not to be able to say you've read it.

9. Pay attention to the author's use of language. Simile, metaphor, symbolism. Words are chosen for a reason.

10. Share with others the books you have enjoyed. Hopefully they will enjoy them as well. The community of readers is almost as important as the books themselves. Be a part of that community.

EDIT: For those who do not understand the title of this post, I am sharing with you what I go by in my own reading. I write this in *my* journal. I am also asking what *you* go by in your own reading/interpretation of a story. I am at no point saying that you should follow any of these rules, and I'm really amazed that anyone could interpret it that way. Do you really think I am telling you that you must write in the margins of a book? Seriously? If you think that, I think I'd rather you not write in the margins of a book. And damn, why's everything have to be an argument on Reddit?

There are countless touching and sad moments throughout the book: Stephen's mother crying when he sings Yeats' ""Who Goes With Fergus,"" Bloom's despair at his infant son Rudy's death, Stephen deciding he can't help his sister because the family will ""drown"" him too, Bloom's father's suicide, Paddy Dignam's funeral and leaving behind his wife and son, etc.

However, it dawned on me that the saddest and most poignant line in the book might be the last line.  No, not the one you're thinking of. Not ""yes I said yes I will yes."" That's the last line of the narrative. The last line of the book are the only words that belong to Joyce himself. His signoff. 

""Trieste-Zurich-Paris, 1914-1921""

This doesn't get much attention obviously, but the more I think about it the more heartbreaking it is. Joyce creates his masterpiece as an ode to his home, ""dear, dirty Dublin."" In fact, all his works are in some way about his home.  The level of detail and amount of research he did to craft such a realistic portrayal of his native city is widely acknowledged to be painstaking. To call it a labor of love almost does disservice to both the words ""labor"" and ""love.""

Now think about it. Joyce chose to sign off with those words: ""Trieste-Zurich-Paris, 1914-1921."" He put them there for a reason. Nothing in Joyce is there by accident or happenstance. Why are they there? Because he wants us to know that the city he loved so much and took such care to render is no longer his home. He's an exile. Living in various spots in Europe. Hundreds of pages -- a masterfully crafted testimonial to his home ... and he's not there.  And he's not going back.  He'll never be home again.  He can only possess it in Ulysses pages.  The book you just finished?  That masterpiece?  That's Joyce's home.  It's all he had.  And you were just a guest in it.

**Final Update** - So in the end, we had 6,600 downloads in less than a day and went from 40,000 in ranking to top 100 in the free section, all thanks to you guys. I cannot properly express my gratitude. You guys are amazing, reviews are already coming in and I'm simply thrilled with the response. There will be future free days in the future, so either email me or follow my twitter (I don't update often, won't flood your stream) if you missed out on yesterday. :) Thanks again everyone.

So my latest book is free to Prime members all the time, but TODAY (January 5th) I am taking that pricetag down to $0.00 for ALL Redditors as a big thank you to the community I've loved for the past year.

**EDIT**: To all of those who have commented on this post, thank you.  To those that agree with me (quite a bit more than I expected), it seems we're probably in the minority.

A word about the tone.  Many of you attacking me haven't read the whole thread or have ignored the fact that I admitted the outburst above was childish and petulant.  It was.  But I thought it would have been disingenuous of me to change it.  It seems however that perhaps I should draw particular attention to this by editing the main post, rather than just saying it in the comments.

**I'm sorry about the tone of the post.**

I regret the use of invective.  I regret targeting particular posts (not explicitly, but they can be inferred) and I regret hurting anyone's feelings (if I actually did such a thing).

I am not sorry about raising the topic though.  It's a valid point.  I guess I was just irritable yesterday morning.  Such posts are rare for me.  

Finally, one parting thought.  To all of you who have criticised me, insulted me or attacked me over daring to criticise those expressing their opinions, or incredulously asking me why I was trying to ""police"" bookit, I refer you to a discussion of [irony](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irony).",,False,self,t5_2qh4i,True,,,True,t3_j6dyg,http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/j6dyg/this_is_bookit_stop_submitting_lame_ass_pictures/,

They're very very conservative christian and I had hoped that they would be accepting but they're not. The books I read have always gone relatively unchecked but now my dad sais that was a mistake. He took about half of my 61 books that I've collected over the years and sais I have to get rid of them. I don't know what to do, Reddit. I've used every argument I can think of and he refuses to see reason. He's going to make me sell them, I'm not sure when. If you live near Morris, IL and you're willing to take about 29 books at least for a few months until I can take them back and hide them or convince him to let me keep them. Many of these books mean a lot to me and I can't bare to see them sold off.
  
Update: There's been a great response so far. Here's the list for those asking: The Monster Hunter Hunter Trilogy by Larry Correia; The Walking Dead Compendium 1 by Robert Kirkman; Anansi Boys, American Gods, Stardust, Smoke and Mirrors, and Fragile Things by Neil Gaiman; Watchers and Prodigal Son by Dean Koontz; High Fidelity by Nick Hornby; Go Mutants by Larry Doyle; Reckless by Cornelia Funke; The Strain by Guillermo Del Toro; H.P. Lovecraft: The Complete Fiction; Eragon and Eldest by Christopher Paollini; Vampirates by Justin Somper; The Lightning Thief and The Sea of Monsters by Rick Riordan; Pride Prejudice and Zombies by Seth Grahame Smith; Dawn of the Dreadfuls by Steve Hockensmith; Everythings Eventual by Steven King and I don't know if it counts but The Skyrim Prima Guide.
  
I have bought and paid for the majority of these with my own money that I earned doing work.

The options I've seen so far are: give them to friends (This was what I was originally considering); A few people have offered to come take them (I'd say this along with the first are my best option. Also I'd get to make a new Reddit friend who's close by); try harder to convince (It won't work); Tell him if he wants to get rid of them he has to burn them, then draw as much media attention to this as possible (That might be a little extreme).

Update 2: I didn't expect it to get this big, thanks guys. My mom ended up finding this post when she checked my history last night. She was mad at first but I explained things better and we  talked for a while. She seems much more accepting and willing to accept than my dad does. Hopefully she'll help sway him. I think I've got them for a little longer now cause I don't think he knows what to do and my mom says she's willing to read some of them and see it from my point of view. 

Someone mentioned Fahrenheit 451, it's funny I literally picked it up the day after he took my books, knowing what it's about and I'm just waiting for him to ask, ""Oh whatcha readin there? What's that about?"" and I get to tell him haha. 

I got a lot of great advice and good arguments to use that I will bring up but for now things are looking up if only a little.

Edit: Here's the books he's letting me keep: The Catcher in the Rye by J. D. Salinger; The Complete Sherlock Holmes by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle; The Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller; I'm Dying Up Here by William Knoedelseder; Seriously Funny by Gerald Nachman; Comedy at the Edge by Richard Zoglin; A Great Silly Grin by Humphrey Carpenter; Hells Angels by Hunter S. Thompson; The Difference Engine by William Gibson; The Battle of the Labyrinth by Rick Riordan; The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins; Incognito by David Eagleman; A Game of Thrones and A Storm of Swords by George R. R. Martin; Off the Mangrove Coast by Louis Lamour; The Sun Going Down by Jack Todd; 1Q84 by Haruki Murakami; Tales of Mystery and Terror by Edgar Allen Poe; The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams; Homeland by R. A. Salvator; Scott Pilgrim 1-6 by Brian Lee O'mally.

Personally, if someone really thought out which book to buy and give me, even if I had read it already or ended up disliking it, I would really appreciate it. They must have put some of their experience, knowledge, and time into the gift.

I know some people would hate it if I gave them a book, simply because they don't read as much, and I obviously would give different gifts if I knew there was a 0% chance of my book being read. On the other hand, I also know people who have been very thankful for a very personalized birthday gift(book with inscription) even if they might not read it for a few years rather than 20$ in a card.

     The world has changed, my friends. You know it, and I know it, but the present incumbent in The White doesn't seem to know it. His advisors don't seem to know it.

 It used to be that what happened in New York and Washington was important in Paramaribo, in Durban, in Kampuchea. Nothing was more important. Well, things have changed. Now we know that what happens in Santiago, in Tehran, in Mali is terribly important in New York and Washington. Nothing is more important

The Third World, as it's called, is no longer something out there - separate from us, inconsequential. Whether we like it or not, the world is becoming covered with a network of fine, sensitive nerves - an electronic nervous system not unlike that which integrates our own bodies. Our finger hurts, our toe hurts and we feel it as much as if our head aches or our heart aches. Instantly now do we feel the pain in Montevideo, in Judah, in Bandung. And yes, my friends in Winslow, we feel the pain from our own, internal Third World - from Harlem, from Watts, from our reservations of Native Americans.

There is no First World, Second World, Third World. The world is becoming integrated before our very eyes.

You and I know there is no theology, no ideology causing this new, sudden, total integration of the world. Christianity has had two thousand years to tie this world together... and it has not done so. Islam has had six hundred years to tie this world together... and it has not done so. American democracy has had two hundred years to tie this world together... and it has not done so. Communism had nearly one hundred years to tie this world together...and it did not do so.
 You and I know what is tying this world together, better than any band of missionaries, however large, ever have or could; better than any marching armies ever have or could.

 Today, satellites permit us to see every stalk of wheat as it grows in Russia, every grain of rice as it grows in China. We can see every soldier as he is trained in Lesotho or Karachi. We can fly to Riyadh or Luzon between one meal and another. Every economic fact regarding Algeria can be assimilated and interpreted within hours. It is possible to poll the entire nation of India regarding their deepest political and other convictions within seconds.
You and I, my friends, know that technology is tying this world together, is integrating this world in a way no theology, no ideology ever could. Technology is forming a nervous system beneath the skin of Mother Earth. And you and I know that to avoid the pain, the body politic had better start responding to this nervous system immediately! If we ignore that which hurts in any part of body earth, we shall suffer years more, generations more of the pain and misery of spreading disease. If we knowingly allow wounds to fester in any particular place, the strength, the energies of the whole world will be sapped!
     American politics must grow up to the new realities of life on this planet! Technology brings us closer than any Biblical brothers! Technology makes us more interdependent than any scheme of capital and labor! Technology is integrating the people of this earth where love and force have failed! This is the new reality! We must seize this understanding! Seize it for peace! For the health of planet earth! My friends, for the very continuation of life on earth!

In case you have no idea who I am, I am several things:

-- For the past 11 years I've been the staff book critic at Time magazine. I review a lot of books, and I think a lot about what's going on with publishing, the contemporary novel, etc. I also get to interview a lot of interesting people—J.K. Rowling, Jonathan Franzen, Neil Gaiman, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, etc. [This](http://entertainment.time.com/2012/05/23/genre-fiction-is-disruptive-technology/) would be an example of the sort of thing I tend to write.


-- I'm the author of [THE MAGICIANS](http://levgrossman.com/the-magicians-a-novel/) and [THE MAGICIAN KING,](http://levgrossman.com/the-magician-king/) which were both New York Times bestsellers. They're fantasy novels with a lot of literary and adult elements worked in. The marketing department calls them ""Harry Potter for Grown-Ups."" And who am I to argue with the marketing department.


-- I'm also the author of a couple of novels that were less successful and/or not at all successful


-- I've done a lot of freelance journalism, mostly about books and technology, for Wired, Salon, Lingua Franca, the Wall Street Journal, Entertainment Weekly, the Village Voice, Time Out NY and the New York Times. I also show up on NPR once in a while.


-- I'm an identical twin


-- I probably spend more time playing KINGDOM RUSH on my iPhone than any other New York Times bestselling author ever. I don't have the exact numbers on that, but I'm pretty confident about it.


-- I'm slightly hungover

I'm very new to Paris and my French is not great, so I still feel very anxious approaching people in stores, even English-language ones.

I spent some time exploring the store (which was awesome) and then asked at the front desk if they had Salman Rushdie's *Satanic Verses*.

I see a lot of posts by redditors and their friends about how excited they are about being ""self-published.""  I hate to say this, but being ""self-published"" doesn't mean ANYTHING.

Let's look at the word ""published"" first.  The mistake ""self-publishers"" make is equating ""hard copy of book"" (or ebook equivalent) with ""published.""  Thus, they think that if they print out and bind their work via iuniverse or something, they are then ""self-published.""

Nononno!  Being published is not just about having a hard copy of one's work - that misses the forest for the trees.  Being published is about convincing a third party that your work is worthwhile enough to support and make public.  It's about earning the respect of a group completely independent of you and having them fund the dissemination of your ideas.

For a novelist this means convincing a publishing company, big or small, that your story is worthwhile.  For an academic it means convincing other academics at a university press that your work is important.  For poets... well, you get the idea.  The bottom line is that real publishing means passing a critical threshhold: your work earning the respect of someone 100% unrelated to you.  There are standards you have to meet or exceed to move on.

When you go to iuniverse or Amazon and ""self-publish"" all you're doing is printing out a copy of your work.  There's no acceptance by unrelated peers - there's no meeting of minimum standards of your field, be it fiction, poetry, whatever - it's just a print shop.  Anyone with the money can print up their work.

This misunderstanding that ""self-publish"" = ""publish"" might not matter to the casual writers, who just want hard copies to hand out to friends, or to sell on their website.  But if you want to be a serious writer all this does is give you an inflated sense of accomplishment that will sabotage your real development.  Good writing takes practice, and if you skip the parts where you have to meet minimum standards, or earn the respect of your peers in an established publishing capacity, you're skipping the hard work.  You'll never, ever get better like that and you won't get any closer to a real, published result.

When someone sees a publishing company logo on a work, be it something huge like Knopf or something tiny like Quirk, people know you've been independently verified - that you've earned the respect of a group established in the literary field and that group believes in your work enough to make it public.  That's trust, that's independent verification.  When you have iuniverse on your work, all people see is that you paid money to print up a hard copy of your work.  That approval from the literary field at large (or your work's niche in it) is not there.

So, please stop saying that you're published when you just released something on Amazon, iuniverse, etc. - frankly it makes you look silly and all you're doing is avoiding the real hard work of publishing and sabotaging your own progress.",,False,self,t5_2qh4i,False,,,True,t3_til3k,http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/til3k/selfpublished_is_not_in_any_way_analogous_to/,

Really. You have said some great things not only about Dune, but about what defines genres of literature and how I should approach reading novels of different varieties. I've been looking for the wrong things in this book, and I shouldn't discount the quality of the book because of that. 

I'm going to finish reading it, and take your advice into account: I'm going to invest myself in this last bit and enjoy the book for what it is. It might not be my favorite book ever, but reading is not just about sitting back and zoning out into a book; sometimes, it's about pushing your comfort zone and forcing yourself to try new things. Heck, maybe I'll end up liking Dune sometime in the future if I reread it. Thanks, /r/books.

_________________

Here's the deal. I'm probably 3/4-4/5 through Dune (just past the start of part 3), and I'm just not feeling interested in the book anymore.

Sure, the setting is unique, the society set up there is reasonable for the situation, and the tale is told as an epic story of grand political schemes and personal character growth, but I'm just not finding the book to be fun to read.

To me, Paul is cool as a character, but I can't connect to him because of just how unusual he is, and after reading 3 books into the Song of Ice and Fire series, with its abundance of strong, complex females, his mother's character seems shallow and trite.

I guess what I'm wondering is: is finishing the book worth it? I'm already so invested in it, but the book hasn't made me care about the story or what happens to the characters. 

Thanks for your input, /r/books .

edit: also could any replies refrain from discussing the ending in detail?

The update is here! Thanks for being so patient. First though, Carrie sent me a short biography about the store and herself. It is a giant wall of text, but the read is worth it. (I will make a nice cut off so you can come back to the grab bag details quicker): 

""Once Sold Tales was started by another man, Rick Henderson, in 2004. My then husband was out of work - an unemployed programmer/network engineer from the ""dot bomb"" - and he was moonlighting to help our economics out. Rick wanted another field of work, so he sold us the 12,000 books and business for 10% of the year's profits. In 2005, Eric Jenott wrote some software to manage the inventory and competitively reprice it, effectively making us competitive with the largest and most prestigious software companies and online book sellers. Within a month, sales had quintupled. We got employees and they worked in our basement to list books for sale and ship them. We started working with libraries and Friends of the Library groups early on, helping their organizations get money for the online sales of their books. We paid them 35% for their online sales, did free book pickups, and soon were working with public libraries, college libraries, Friends &amp; Foundations of libraries, Union Gospel Mission, thrift stores, churches, other booksellers, and were fundraising for all of them. There were up to 250 different organizations we supported throughout Washington state and Northern Oregon. We've gone from 12,000 books in our basement to over 1/2 Million books in 30,000 sq. ft. of warehouse. Those were good times. Books were flying out the door at good prices. I did some presentations at library functions to help Friends of the Library groups understand the online sales process. 

We have had a lot of fun. We threw a ""Tolkien &amp; Tea"" Bilbo Baggins birthday party and had a projector show all 3 extended versions of the Lord of the Rings on our warehouse wall while we served tea and ""elevensies"" to all who came, and many came in costume. The Knights of Veritas also came out and did demonstrations and we hosted their monthly ""historically authentic German Longsword"" swordsmanship classes in our warehouse (they are located in Moses Lake). We had a Steampunk English Contra Dance fundraiser and raised $500. We've hosted NaNoWriMo (National Novel Writing Month) participants who were writing novels in November and gave them tons of free coffee and cookies. We invited the local Etsy artisans in to show off their wares and get more public exposure through our bookstore, as we support local business. 

We also did a lot of cool things, too. We donated thousands of audio books to organizations for the blind. We did food drives and gave away free books to folks who would donate food to Northwest Harvest. We donated pregnancy &amp; childcare books to pregnancy centers, and thousands of books to school literacy nights. We also had a great ""Zero to 60"" Free Book program that let any child aged Birth - 12th grade to come to our bookstore and get 5 FREE books per month from anything in the bookstore. We've had about 1000 kids come in any given month and get their free books. I really think we did a lot of good and helped a lot of people. I try to remember that in the midst of seeing this ""good thing"" come to a close. A lot of people have certainly been distressed and sad to see us go and have told us how we've impacted their lives. We were a go-to for families with small children who got their free books each month. One mother had 2 dyslexic sons who had trouble reading. They started coming to Once Sold Tales to pick out books they were interested in and spent much more time reading. They had to build bookshelves in their home, and their dad reads to them every night and now they are proficient and avid readers. THAT makes it all worth it. We changed the world, one life at a time. 

Once Sold Tales was not only helping the community, but it also helped our staff, and my family. Before the business took off, we were fairly impoverished and going to the food bank. I can appreciate hard times and we never wanted there to be an economic barrier to children having access to books. Our staff have also been positively impacted by Once Sold Tales. At least 2 sets of couples have met at Once Sold Tales, and one has already married. Young staff who are often students have been able to pay for college and cars and have gained leadership and business experience from working at Once Sold Tales. Our turnover rate was ridiculously low - especially for the industry - as so many people loved working here. Recently, 2 people have bought homes. We help each other out. We celebrate birthdays and have a generous sick day policy - because life happens. I hope I can find another place to work that is half as awesome as it was to work at Once Sold Tales.... I'm going to miss the people so much and they have promised that we're going to have regular get togethers so we can keep enjoying each other's company. We're crazy, and we like it that way. :-) 

I've been working at Once Sold Tales for 9 years - since the beginning. I am a self taught marketer, supply logistics, HR, Bookstore manager, sales rep, customer service, software &amp; warehouse process developer, website designer, and partner organization liaison. I just generally call myself the ""Business Developer"" but now that we're an LLC, I'm officially the President and CEO. It is the most involved job I've ever had - before this, I was a homeschooling mom of 5. And through all this.....I was still a homeschooling mom of 5. :-) 

Asking me what is my favorite book is akin to asking me which is my favorite child... I enjoy an eclectic variety, but have noticed a distinct Anglophile trend - I love British authors and abhor post modernism. My favorite books: The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy 5-book trilogy by Douglas Adams, The Lord of the Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien, anything by Robert Louis Stevenson, C. S. Lewis, Yeats, Keats, Longfellow, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Shakespeare... I like Tolstoy and Jules Verne and Richard Feynman. I'm completely addicted to Ted Dekker and devour everything he writes, even though it keeps me up all night because I can't put it down and it's frightened my overactive imagination. I thoroughly enjoyed ""Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead"" and ""Catch-22 by Joseph Heller"" (not so much his other books). I like Charles Dickens and Daniel Defoe. The Three Musketeers. Adventure novels like what Jack London and Gary Paulson writes. Imaginative works that inspire like things by Madeline L'Engle. I'm hoping to read ""Master and Commander"" and other books by Patrick O'Brian next. I keep meaning to read ""The Wheel of Time"" series by Robert Jordan and have mutually enjoyed the works of Brian Jacques with my kids. I also think I want to read ""Ender's Game"" by Orson Scott Card. I like dramatized history and the occasional biography. I like some classics. But not, by any means all. 

We have a common rant at Once Sold Tales, and that is our frustration with miserable works being called ""classics"" about selfish, miserable people doing miserable, selfish things. I particularly dislike stories about dysfunctional families or women, chasing after dysfunctional men, and often it all coming to ruin. That would include almost all ""romance"" novels, Gone With The Wind, Anna Karenina, Madame Bovary, Wuthering Heights, Doctor Zhivago, and I know enough about F. Scott Fitzgerald and ""The Great Gatsby"" to imagine it is more misery. I have perhaps offended enough people with my disparaging remarks about Twilight....so perhaps it's best if I just don't go there. :-) My staff have a plan for our extra Twilight copies that I am now trying to GIVE AWAY for free. It. Involves. Kindling. 

At our busiest, ever, we sold about 3,000 books a day. Not too bad for our little company. ""

~~DETAILS (I did promise)~~

~~Product: Standard Reddit Grab Bag~~

~~Sizes: Small or Large **EDIT** *Bags will have maximum weight of 4 and 8 lbs respectively*~~

~~Contents: Approximately 8 or 16 mass market paperbacks~~

~~Level 0 Categories: Adventure, Chick Lit, Random~~

~~Level 1 Categories:  Science Fiction, Fantasy, Classics, Westerns, Romance, Young Adult~~

~~Level 2 Categories:  Whatever you request (Authors, special genres, you name it, Carrie and crew will do their best)~~

~~COST: 10$ or 18$. SHIPPING INCLUDED FOR CONTINENTAL U.S.~~

===

~~Product: Children's Reddit Grab Bag~~

~~Size: Small or Large~~

~~Contents: As many books as can fit~~

~~COST: 12$ or 20$~~

~~**IMPORTANT NOTE** Do **NOT** go to the website for a grab bag! The website is already bogged down enough, and you **CAN NOT** order the grab bag there. ~~

~~INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING:  
	Is a pain. Even just across the border to Canada. Right now, rates are being determined so we can offer a standardized product. I will help get this figured out, but for now, sound off in the comments about what you think works best. Maybe a ""Here is X dollars, send me as many books as you can!"" deal. This will be updated and decisions will be made.~~

~~HOW TO PURCHASE:  
	Paypal is the way to pay. All payments to be made to REMOVED. Subject should be your products and the optional message is not optional. Make certain to share your category selections, but note: while Once Sold Tales will try their hardest to get you what you want, only Category 0 can be guaranteed.~~

Check the album in this post for an example: http://imgur.com/a/8wha3

~~HOW TO DONATE:~~
	~~I don't know! Paypal does have a Donate button, however there are issues involved, since Carrie is running a for-profit business. Implementation is simple with a Paypal Donate Button, but getting the money later has been difficult for others. If you have a suggestion, put it out there and I will find a best solution. Temporary solution: Buy a small random bag of books and beyond the 10$ price, include an itemized 'handling' fee of your choice. You still get books, but also contribute. Then, when the books arrive you donate them, since you are already awesome. If against Paypal TOS, then don't.~~

~~GIVING BOOKS:  
	Have a friend or library that could use books, but they are somewhere else? You can order books for others, as a gift,  just make sure to provide the appropriate information. Note: there are rules about sending books to prisons. So don't.~~

IN-PERSON DEAL:  (Warehouse hours: Mon - Sat 10am - 9pm, Sun Noon - 6)
	This one works on the honor system. If you can share Carrie's story with someone who hasn't heard it yet, feel free to show up at the warehouse and get one book for free. This deal is only for regular books (no Gutenberg Bibles, which she doesn't have) and only works if you are buying other books as well. (Listen, I could put all that fine print stuff, about one per person per day per solar eclipse blah blah blah, but just be a cool person. Its way easier, since Carrie will just say no if you aren't) When checking out, just say you are from the internet. No, really.

NOTES:  
	I have never done this before. If it looks like it was slammed together, well, it was. I appreciate the awesome feedback I've gotten and the kind words. If you commented or messaged me, I will get back to you. Give me some time though. Please, though, message me again if you don't hear from me in a week. If you fall through the cracks, I'm sorry and I will get to you.

**EDIT**: Carrie and crew are already seeing a ton of orders! I think reddit is going to break things, but rest assured that your orders will be worked on. There is only one person who is in charge of shipping so please be patient. I am at the store today, so stop on by and say hi. I will also be doing my best to share what I can and reply to comments, but be kind, I haven't been this in-demand ever.

**EDIT2**: I apologize for the weight limits being enacted. These are really high numbers (most bags are 1/2 to 3/4 that) but there are extra heavy books out there that are throwing off the numbers. These prices are somewhere between losing money and beating out pulping, so we all appreciate your patience and understanding.

~~**EDIT3**: International shipping is here! You select the categories, however there is only one size: USPS Large Flatrate Priority box. These boxes are 23-11/16"" x 11-3/4"" x 3"" or 12"" x 12"" x 5-1/2"" with a maximum weight of 20lbs. Carrie and crew will shove as many books as they can inside. Prices are $65 for Canadian and $85 for all other international. I know the price is high and I'm sorry those not in the continental US can't enjoy the cheapest of books. *Make sure to note INTERNATIONAL so the crew knows how to pull*~~

Here is the original post: 
http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/g1iue/my_85_year_old_grandma_just_published_her_first/

She has been in town all summer (she lives elsewhere the rest of the year) and our small local library has scheduled her to lead a book discussion and signing a few weeks ago.  Other local cafes have hosted her for this same exact event, as well as other libraries in other parts of our state. An anonymous community dweller here in town read the book beforehand and felt that it was ""inappropriate for discussion"" because the book used the word ""fuck"" and she objected to it. She called the head county librarian (about 2 hours away from our tiny local branch) and told her to cancel the scheduled book discussion. It was indeed cancelled, flyers had to be removed from town and people were turned away at the library door on the day of the discussion (who went there for that purpose). My grandma was shocked and outraged.  
In my grandma's words in an e-mail to me about it: 
"" Can you believe this? Not only censorship of a book, but censorship of ""freedom of speech"". NOT ONE LIBRARIAN READ THE BOOK and yet they believed this **#$%^ $!%^&amp; woman and cancelled the discussion based on her opinion.""  

She actually asked me if I would post her story to Reddit for her, so here you go. I think that any support, advice, or direction for her would be appreciated.  

Here is a link to the book on Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/ROSIES-GRINGO-PALACE-Irene-Tritel/dp/0982805306/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1315175779&amp;sr=8-1

TL;DR: My grandma got fucked by the local library for using the word ""fuck"" in her book.

Seems like a lot of people say they don't have time to look around for new authors. That's interesting because it basically leaves their discovery to the press, right? Maybe this thread will help with some new ideas. If you all include links, that would be great. Also if the author has been a bestseller, like Patrick Rothfuss and Brandon Sanderson who were listed multiple times - really? - that's not what this thread is for, just saying!

It has spread to 3 places on his spine and he's started emergency chemo and radiation. He is losing his will to live very fast and I need your help.
  
I bought him an iPhone and I need some music/audio books for it that are positive, encouraging and will give him mental strength to live. I firmly believe the cancer fight is one of mental willpower and he need's all the help he can get. Any help will be greatly appreciated!!! Thanks

But whenever I read anything by someone like Dickens, it's just gibberish to me.   It takes me a very long time to understand each sentence, re-reading everything.
 
Is there a list of books I can read that'll slowly build up my understanding of the language used pre-20th century?  I try to read classic poetry every day but that doesn't help much.  I was thinking of taking a classic book from each decade and reading them in backwards chronological order, but I'm not sure that'd help if I don't know exactly what books to read.
 
I have a good friend who is a professor of english literature and she says that Dickens and books like that aren't really very good, and she prefers the ones that are written more simply anyway, so she can't help me.

Any ideas?

1. I know it's a humorous book but does it bring up some interesting points and philosophies about the universe? Does it leave you thinking ""Hey that's an interesting way to look at it.""?

2. Is the writing style intelligent? Does it sound like it's meant for little kids or adults?

3. Is the humor intelligently funny or ""slap-stick"" funny? 

4. Overall, is it worth a read?

That's all the questions I have for now. If you have any other points you think I should know then please let me know. 

Edit: Grammar.

1354511069.0,410,self.books,146p7a,What are your favorite book series that are longer- minimum 5 books in the series,ThoughtRiot1776,549,139,884,http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/146p7a/what_are_your_favorite_book_series_that_are/,"I know there have been threads about peoples' favorite series before, but this one is for longer ones.  I love nothing more than getting into a great series because who doesn't love a series that keeps you up until the early morning and then makes you get out of bed to find the next one and continue the story.

Here's my list:

* Robert Jordan's (RIP) Wheel of Time.  Really just an epic series coming in at 14 books.  The final novel is set to be released in January.  It got me over my fantasy prejudice.  The first book borrows heavily from Lord of the Rings and the author acknowledged this, but from there, it's pretty original world that he creates.  There's a minor issue in that book 10, Crossroads of Twilight, is pretty slow.  But the series is too good for a single mediocre book to drag it down.  I highly suggest it.  Give it a shot.  Mat Calhoun becomes the best character after being kinda a dick.

* A Song of Ice and Fire.  I don't think that this one really requires an explanation.  Another great fantasy world.  Martin really drags you in with Game of Thrones before putting in any of the weirder, more fantastical elements.

* Bernard Cornwell's Sharpe series.  There are 11 original books that take Sharpe through the Spanish Peninsula all the way to Waterloo during the Napoleonic Wars as he fights under Wellington.  Sharpe is a commoner who was jumped up from the ranks and commands a groups of riflemen- skirmishers.  Sharpe is a badass character that is just a ton of fun to read.  Cornwell writes great stories and he does a fantastic job at describing the battles in a way that makes them come alive and also very easy to follow.  The series was popular enough to warrant Cornwell writing 3 prequels of him in India and now there are 24 total Sharpe books.  I recommend to everyone, but I think guys are more likely to like it.

* Bernard Cornwell's Saxon Stories.  Uthred is an Anglo (ok, I'm messing up the term) who is captured by Danes who raise him.  He loves the Danes and follows their beliefs.  But he becomes a warlord of Alfred the Great, who is responsible for creating the idea of England instead of separate kingdoms.  Uthred is another great character.  He's fun to listen to, talks down to the priests (except one or two), creates controversy, and is another badass motherfucker whose exploits are just a ton of fun to follow.

* Conn Iggulden's Conqueror series.  Follows Genghis Khan from childhood, his uniting of the Mongol people, and their conquests.  Later goes on to follow his descendants.  Really good historical fiction.  First book is a tad slow for a little bit, but it picks right up again.  Based heavily on The Secret History of the Mongols.  His Emperor series will be 5 books when the next one comes out, but it's just too fictionalized and untrue to the historical record for my taste.

* Colleen McCullough's Master of Rome Series.  Probably the best historical fiction out there in terms of scholarship, accuracy, and detail.  7 books take you from 110-27 BC.  Very long books that are pretty dense.  But the time period is well documented and she does a great job with it.  There are plenty of real characters that she uses that are all fascinating.

* Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey–Maturin series (AKA Master and Commander).  Probably the golden standard of historical fiction.  If you're interested in the British Navy during the time period, this is what you want to read.  Great books.  Must reads.  Hornblower gets a nod, but O'Brian's series is better.

* Simon Scarrow's Eagle series.  Follows a Roman centurion and his optio (think sergeant).  Cato is upjumped as a favor for his father and has to prove himself whereas Macro is a grizzled veteran.  They have enemies within the officer corps of the Roman elite who strive to undermine them.  Two really cool characters that interact well.  The first books start in Britain, but they go all over the Empire.  Pretty good to the historical record for the most part.

* Vince Flynn's Mitch Rapp series.  Kind of a guilty pleasure of mine.  Rapp is a CIA agent who does the whole counter-terrorism deal.  Lots of stereotypes.  He's a badass.  He hates the red tape and regulations that hold him back from achieving his goals.  All that good stuff.  But the stories are good, plots interesting, and it shits all over something like Dan Brown in terms of a light read that is actually good.

* King's The Dark Tower- 8 books, all really good.  Read it.

I know I'm forgetting a couple so I'll post some more later.  Would like to see what /r/books likes in terms of series and maybe find a new one for when I finish rereading Wheel of Time.

I downloaded a torrent file with a bunch of books, and was pleased to see the Harry Potter series in it, thinking I'd finally get through it.

I trudged through, and finally finished it last night.

I was talking with my roommate and his girlfriend today about how I hated the end where they alluded to Dudley Dursley being the next Voldemort, and was met with looks of confusion.  I explained where it happened, and then we went back and forth, and apparently our versions of the book had been different.  I was confused, because as we got deeper into it, it became clear that we had read COMPLETELY DIFFERENT versions of this last book.

I checked the wikipedia, and it fell in line with what they were saying about the book, which I had not believed them because it sounded like it SUCKED compared to the version I had read.

I decided I must find out the truth, and went on a quest.

I then found the [FANFIC](http://www.melindaleo.com/fics/tsh/) I had just read, which had been placed in the massive torrent file, renamed as Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.  I highly encourage reading through it - the ENTIRE book was rewritten, and it was very well done.

I now go to find the real version to finish (pissed off, I thought I was done with this series!) - and I leave this post here for you all to be amused, ridiculing, curious, blasé, whatever, etc., et al, ad nauseam.

**EDIT:** Some of you seem to think I have an aversion to supporting the author, which is just completely untrue.  It happened to be in a big torrent of books, most of which were out-of-print/free.  I was lazy and read the books, so what?  I'll probably buy the series again anyways, just 'cause I like to own things, and digital copies just don't have the same feel.

Now he's working on a new, updated list with more data, so with that in mind I figure it's time for a new thread where we can add such data by voting on our favorite books with our upvotes.


Please be sure to:

- Include the author as well as the title in each post

- Only post one book per post

- Preferably include separate books in a series in separate post (IE, don't post ""The Lord of the Rings."" Instead, post separate entries with each respective book.

- Be sure to Ctrl+F to see if your book has already been posted.


I'll start with a few of my favorites.


EDIT: There are a lot of novels here which is wonderful, but I'd like to remind you that you can also submit books of nonfiction, plays, or short stories.

EDIT2: There are a few duplicates showing up. Please be sure to use Ctrl+F so that duplication can be avoided and Raerth can count more easily.

I think prices like this are helping contribute to the demise of the local independent bookseller, who can't possibly match the 47% discount Amazon offers, and to the demise of the printed book and brick-and-mortar bookstores in general. What causes this? Are paper costs really climbing that high? Are ebooks and the deep discounts they offer forcing publishers to compensate by raising prices on physical books? Or am I overreacting, and should just accept that having to pay $30+ to hold a book in your hands is the way of the world now?

Logically, you would think that the moment a supposedly intelligent nineteen-year-old became aware of this paradox, he'd stop being a fraud and just settle for being himself (whatever that was) because he'd figured out that being a fraud was a vicious infinite regress that ultimately resulted in being frightened, lonely, alienated, etc. But here was the other, higher-order paradox, which didn't even have a form or name -- I didn't, I couldn't.

Hopefully this works for you all.

I was looking at my bookcase tonight and I decided to pull some books from there that I really enjoyed, but don't often see people talk about, and share them with you. I always enjoy recommendations, and I hope you all enjoy them as well. I write notes for every book I've read. If you have any questions about the books, I can dig up my notes and share with you what I wrote while reading the book. I've shared what little I remember about each one.

1. [*The Counterfeiters*](http://www.amazon.com/Counterfeiters-Novel-Andre-Gide/dp/0394718429/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327049550&amp;sr=1-1) by Andre Gide - Set in Paris just prior to World War I, this novel uses the plot of counterfeit money to explore some pretty interesting concepts (e.g., what is value? what differentiates a copy from its original?). With a tone of hopeless nihilism, and a seedy, cynical prose, we follow human disorder, weakness and despair from birth to death.

2. [*The Demolished Man*](http://www.amazon.com/DEMOLISHED-MAN-Alfred-Bester/dp/B00446J08E/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327050274&amp;sr=1-1) by Alfred Bester - In a future ruled by enlightened telepaths who prevent crime by knowing about it before it occurs, how can one man possibly get away with murder? This masterpiece is a super interesting sci-fi read whose suspense will have you turning pages when you should be sleeping. It's not a highly intellectual read, but a lot of good fun to be had here.

3. [*Hunger*](http://www.amazon.com/Hunger-Novel-Knut-Hamsun/dp/0374531102/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327051820&amp;sr=1-1) by Knut Hamsun - This is the story of a man who is losing his mind from starvation. It's a story of a man with too much pride. Honestly, very rarely does a book really get under my skin, but this book made me feel as though I was losing my mind. I thoroughly enjoyed it, but was glad when it was finally over as well.

4. [*Angels*](http://www.amazon.com/Angels-Novel-Denis-Johnson/dp/0060988827/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327051923&amp;sr=1-4) by Denis Johnson - After reading [*Seek*](http://www.amazon.com/Seek-Reports-Edges-America-Beyond/dp/0060930470/ref=sr_1_6?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327051923&amp;sr=1-6), I found myself a bit obsessed with Denis Johnson. I've now read many of his books, but one that has stuck with me has to be his first novel, *Angels*. Quite a few years ago I was having a discussion with a friend about the role each person has in their own life. I was on the side that people are often nothing more than captives of their own circumstances, while my friend took a much more Sartrean approach saying that each person wills their own life, thus is responsible for everything that comes out of it. This discussion is one of the major themes of this book. How much of a role do we have in our own lives, and how much of where we are is due to our circumstances? Denis Johnson is probably the best American writer alive -- sad he doesn't get more recognition.

5. [*Pigtopia*](http://www.amazon.com/Pigtopia-Kitty-Fitzgerald/dp/B002SB8OPM/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327058828&amp;sr=1-1) by Kitty Fitzgerald - I really enjoyed Katherine Dunn's [*Geek Love*](http://www.amazon.com/Geek-Love-Novel-Katherine-Dunn/dp/0375713344/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327052481&amp;sr=8-1), and when I set out to find something similar, I certainly wasn't thinking I'd find something better, but that's exactly what happened. In the same vein as Dunn's book, *Pigtopia* is certainly filled with gore and macabre. However, as shocking as this book may be, it is also filled with beauty. It's the story of a disfigured, abused, and abandoned idiot who has created his own world (a la Pan's Labyrinth) to escape his reality. Someone comes along and pulls him from his world to help him face the real world. This is an awesome story of rejection and love. I don't want to give too much away, so I'll stop here.

6. [*Second Hand Smoke*](http://www.amazon.com/Second-Hand-Smoke-Thane-Rosenbaum/dp/0312254180/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327058844&amp;sr=1-1) by Thane Rosenbaum - Honestly, I've read way too many books about the Holocaust -- I'm really done with this subject at this point. However, I picked up this book on my wife's recommendation, and I'm really glad I gave it a chance. Unlike many Holocaust books, this one doesn't actually deal with the concentration camps directly. Rather, this is a book set in Miami, following a card shark who lives by the wits she used to survive the Holocaust. More than that, this is the story of her family, and how her experience impacts those who did not experience it. Now maybe the title packs more of a hit?

7. [*Meditations in Green*](http://www.amazon.com/Meditations-Green-Stephen-Wright/dp/0375712933/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327058867&amp;sr=1-1) by Stephen Wright - This was one of the best war novels I've read. It's the story of the Vietnam war, and its aftermath, and the chronicle of the decay of one soldier. The protagonist is initially a cocky man, thinking the war may be a bit of fun, and something he can certainly get through unharmed. We watch as the man decays from an intelligent and strong person into a heroin addict trying to turn himself into a plant form. The amazing aspect of this book is how Wright is able to relate the Vietnam war to the absurdities in our lives in the real world. James Griffin (the protagonist) hasn't really left what is wrong with the world back in Vietnam. This isn't going to be very popular around here, but I enjoyed this book more than I enjoyed *Catch-22*, and Wright certainly deserves far more recognition than Heller received, but alas that's not how history unfolded.

8. [*Kitchen*](http://www.amazon.com/Kitchen-Banana-Yoshimoto/dp/0671880187/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327053858&amp;sr=1-1) by Banana Yoshimoto - This is actually two short stories, each dealing with death, transsexuality, kitchens and love. The biggest focus here is going on with one's own life after the loss of a loved one. I really enjoyed both stories, and thought they dealt with the subject matter beautifully.

9. [*In the Dutch Mountains*](http://www.amazon.com/Dutch-Mountains-Harvest-Translation/dp/015600402X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327054081&amp;sr=1-1) by Cees Nooteboom - I really enjoy the creativity of Cees Nooteboom. I've yet to read anything by him that I did not enjoy. This story starts in a classroom, where a Spanish bureaucrat tells a story. The story is of Kai and Lucia, the children of circus performers, who are forced to leave their safe home and travel to a place in ruins. Kai is abducted by the Snow Queen's sorcerer, leaving Lucia -- with the aid of a clown -- to save him. This is a great book for kids, but even adults will enjoy entering the imaginative and incredible worlds Cees Nooteboom builds.

10. [*Caucasia*](http://www.amazon.com/Caucasia-Novel-Danzy-Senna/dp/1573227161/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327054400&amp;sr=1-1) by Danzy Senna - Being biracial myself (Mexican/White), I am very interested in the subject of race. This is the story of a young girl's struggle to understand her roots and her identity. However, this book transcends the subject of race -- while examining it -- and is really a story of identity that any race can identify with.",,False,self,t5_2qh4i,True,,,True,t3_ooq2a,http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ooq2a/id_like_to_recommend_some_books_that_ive_really/,

These are mostly good authors, and a couple are great. But we've all heard of all of them at this point. Why aren't there more posts about non-fiction books? Or literary fiction? How about discussion of classic literature, or reviews of new books that aren't necessarily sf/fantasy? Yes, I know these things get posted to some extent, but right now there are three different Gaiman related posts, a meme, an *Ender's Game* post, a post about *The* fucking *Alchemist*, and multiple posts about a potential movie of *The Giver*, a young adult book.

I guess this is just me blowing off steam and it will (deservedly) get downvoted to hell.

Feel free to weigh in on opinions related to:

1)  **Purpose**  We will develop a guiding statement for /r/Books going forward.  Something to help new members understand what the subreddit is about and to help moderators keep things in line.

&gt;This community is focused on discussing books, authors, genres, or everything else book related.

The current statement might cover it for us without any changes.  Discussion of books, info on authors, genres and everything else.  We may add scope to include the publishing industry and e-books into that scope as well.  

2)  **Rules - What /r/Books Encourages and Removes**  

These are my *draft* points of view that can be accepted, rejected or adjusted.  We mods are working through what should be carved in stone and what might need to evolve organically with the community...

* I will personally push for **no memes**.  None at all.  Point here is that memes become the antithesis of book *discussion*, which should be at the core of /r/Books.
* We will work to encourage posting of book-related news and questions that spur book-related discussions.  
* Book recommendations are a constant request.  Potential to have a process in place to highlight recommendation questions.
* Bookporn should probably be eliminated.  ""Look at what I own"" pictures rarely add value and there are subreddits like /r/bookshelf for bookish photo shoots.  
* Blogspamming is an issue today and will only become more of an issue. We will continue to ban spammers quickly.
* AMAs will continue to become part of the agenda.  The nature of /r/Books is that these will need to be more recognized authors plus industry people.

Point in all of this is to add an element of focus to /r/Books as the subreddit grows.  We all have seen subreddits degrade due to volume and lack of purpose.

We will also be putting out an official request for help from new mods - please keep an eye out.
