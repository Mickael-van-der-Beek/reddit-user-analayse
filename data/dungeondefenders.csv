**Getting Mana:**

* Survivals are usually the best way to farm mana. Putting hardcore (HC) on increases drop value, and mix mode (MM) increases it further. In practice, mix mode means tougher enemies, less predictable spawns, and more wyverns.

* There's a higher drop limit with more people, but it doesn't double for twice the number of people. You'll get the most mana playing solo.

* To play NMHC survival solo, you will most likely need more than one build character. The most important are the squire and summoner. A monk for auras and an EV to place buff beams are also pretty essential. Concentrate on getting some of these to level 74 so you can equip them with some basic mythic armor. It's less important to have high stats for your EV because buff beams don't scale very well. There are lots of suggested builds available on [DD Planner](http://www.ddplanner.com). Click 'search' and then click on the map you want and a list of builds will appear.

* If you start at wave 9 or above, you'll get extra mana from chests in the first round, allowing you to finish your build before you start playing. This increases, so at 13 you'll get 720 from each chest. However you can't start at a wave until you've beaten that wave on the same difficulty.

* Once your build is solid, keep your summoner out, because armor drops sell for more than weapons. You can repair from phase shift while you go.

* During long rounds, item drops start disappearing because there is a maximum number that can be on the map at any given point. Because of this, filling your item box with loot in the early/middle part of a round will increase your mana haul. Before you start make sure everything you want to keep is locked or in a folder, then you can loot a bunch of stuff and 'sell all' at the end of the round. It's worth noting that the items that disappear first are those that the game deems the lowest quality, so if you're interested in finding good drops to use, you don't need to worry about frantically searching/looting during the wave.

* Magus Quarters is a good map to start with, as it's the easiest. Endless Spires is a good second when you're a little stronger, and then Mistymire (here you will start to get trans drops). Eventually you'll be able to manage Aquanos or the King's Game, which have great drops.

* Be aware that there is a 'soft cap' at 600 million mana. At this point you will stop getting any more mana from item sales during a game. When the game is finished you can make a mana token in the tavern (under 'services'). During a game, you can put mana into upgrading some of your stuff, so nothing is going to waste. Only upgrade your very best stuff, because the rest will fall by the wayside as you climb the gear ladder. On a similar note, it's generally not good to use upgrades on resists for your build characters. It's tempting to try and make an all-rounder, but really you'll do better keeping your tower and DPS characters separate. Soloing Magus Quarters NMHCMM you will easily reach the 600m cap from zero, and then some. 


**Using Mana**

* Some people are initially confused by how to shop. There's a 'view shops' button at the bottom left when you're on the game search screen. People host 'afk shops' where they sell their stuff. Once you're able to solo Magus Quarters, paying 200 million for a quality piece of myth armor doesn't seem such a big deal.

* Bear in mind that items can't be valued in the shop for more than 600m. If something is on the floor, it's probably because they want more than 600m for it. Or they may just be showing it off and it's not for sale.

* Myth armor can vary hugely in quality. The best pieces are higher quality than a lot of trans stuff in terms of the stats they give you. You can reach 1500-2500 tower stats with just good mythic armor and a decent weapon/pet. Info on set bonuses and armor types can be found [here](http://dungeondefenders.wikia.com/wiki/Armor).

* You can also buy items on the [trendy forums](http://forums.trendyent.com/forumdisplay.php?32-PC-Mac-Trading-and-Grouping), but most people there are concerned with high level trading like supreme armor for cubes and stuff like that. Which leads me to...


**Cubes and high-level trading**

* A 'Cube' refers to a floating companion cube pet, like from portal. You get one as a reward for completing all the *original* challenges on NMHC difficulty (not just NM). That means everything from 'No Towers Allowed' to 'Monster Fest'. This is surprisingly easy to do compared to a lot of things on nightmare, although you'll need help from other players.

* Each player can only ever get one cube. When you get yours **DO NOT UPGRADE IT**. A non-upgraded cube is referred to as 'clean', and is valued more highly. A lot of people have made something of a fetish of them, and try to collect as many as possible. This stockpiling combined with their rarity has driven them to a high price. Currently you can get about 90 billion mana for a cube, although that information will likely be redundant in a month. That sounds like a lot, but be wary, at very high levels most people aren't interested in selling you things for mana, they want to trade for other rare things (other cubes, supreme armor, pet rocks, chickens, ultimate weapons, etc).

* Getting your cube is a great way to make a leap in progress, because you can trade it for a bunch of great gear, or sell it and try to buy great gear. You can make an auction thread on the forums and see what people offer you.


**Getting Experience**

* The more people in a game, the more EXP you'll get, so playing solo is counterproductive. This is because more monsters spawn with more people. You can also get 1.3x bonuses for the following: No Core Damage (crystals took no damage that round), No Player Damage (you didn't get hit that round), and Only Used Weapons (you didn't damage enemies with towers). They seem to stack by addition (i.e. for all three, you won't get (1 x 1.3 x 1.3 x 1.3), but rather 1 x 1.9). It's sad that the game rewards relying on someone else's build and hiding in a safe spot not taking damage, but there it is.

* The best maps for levelling are Glitterhelm Caverns and Aquanos. Aquanos is considerably better, but harder. Insane survivals on Aquanos will get you to level 74 very quickly.


**Miscellaneous**

* Turning off camera shake, step towards melee target, and enemy spawn notifications will make your ride a lot smoother in Nightmare.

* Use a genie! Genies are pets that give you mana when you damage enemies with your character's weapon. The amount depends on the base damage of the genie. A decent one will get you around 300 mana per hit which is more than enough. They're a reward for reaching wave 15 on Hall of Court Survival (medium or harder). Genies are great for helping you quickly upgrade all of your towers during the early stages of a survival. You'll need to hit for about 20k or more in the tavern to get the most out of your genie in nightmare. More detailed info on genies [here](http://forums.trendyent.com/showthread.php?32590-Some-Math-on-Genies).

* Imps are pets that repair nearby towers/auras automatically, but use mana. Handy if you're going to go afk during a survival (protip- stand by a mage minion so the damage you take from projectiles gets healed). They're a reward for wave 15 on Endless Spires (medium or harder).

* While hero damage is scaled down in nightmare, pet damage is not. Pets can therefore be a great source of DPS. Seahorses are great for this (Aquanos survival wave 20 reward). 


**Building Tips**

* Since minions use MU instead of DU, a build without them is essentially incomplete.

* Archers and mages are generally considered the best bang for your MU buck, and you rarely see anything else in NMHC builds. A line of archers with a mage or two can be used as a self-healing, damage-dealing blockade, allowing you to save DU on barriers. Building a buff beam for them to stand on is often effective. Alternatively, squeezing archers onto buff beams that already exist for your harpoons or fireball towers is also effective.

* Your build should be centred around trying to get as many things buffed as possible, while using the least amount of DU. A fully upgraded tower buff beam will more than *triple* the DPS of a harpoon, for instance (tested with my relatively weak EV's buff beams in tavern). You really shouldn't have any unbuffed damage towers. They will also massively increase aura radius and electric aura DPS. Buffing does not increase tower health, although buffing a blockade will increase it's resistance to damage. A buff beam will go down when something it is buffing goes down, so be careful about buffing blockades.

* When something is being buffed, you'll see purple lines glowing from the centre of the tower/minion. Buffs don't stack, so for example an aura with multiple buff beams within it will be the same as if there were only one.

* Always upgrade your buff beams first. Upgrading them makes your towers hit harder, faster and further, and balloons your auras to a much greater size. Also upgrade your auras as soon as possible. It doesn't do much for their effectiveness but it increases their lifespan, which drains quickly in nightmare. If an aura goes down, your buff will go down, which can easily lead to your defenses being overwhelmed.

* Never underestimate wyverns, especially in mix mode. Don't be shy about allocating a big portion of your DU/MU to wyvern defense, as it's usually them that take you out.

* Any tower or group of towers should have at least one archer nearby, for protection from spiders (electric auras also are a great help in this area).

Hello Defenders!

I have the following Mythical Retributions to give to the community:

* [Ret 1](http://i.imgur.com/4Lmyy.png)
* [Ret 2](http://i.imgur.com/WZ16T.png)
* [Ret 3](http://i.imgur.com/X0alE.png)
* [Ret 4](http://i.imgur.com/E39HA.png)

All you have to do is reply with a number between 1 and 1000 to participate. One number per person and make sure it's unique.

This friday I will generate four random numbers via random.org (screenshots provided). The one closest to the first number will have first pick, the one closest to the second number will have second pick, etc. 

I know they are not the best of the best, but i'm sure they can make someone happy, else you can always sell them for mana.

Happy guessing!

Edit:

With the retribution nerf of 7.16b i will end the give away thursday evening (18:00 gmt).

General game mechanics

a) exp sharing: just make all exp shared 100%. It's anti-griefing and it keeps people from competing for kills and making stupid decisions. If someone isn't doing their part (legitimately) then they can be kicked by the host.

b) elemental resistant, not immune, mobs. It makes the game a bit more fire and forget, but it also helps out the classes that need the biggest buff. This simple change along with adding physical as a possible resistance makes apprentice and monk towers much more appealing and the physical resistance is also a slight nerf to squire towers.

Quality of life changes

a) Pets (and maybe some items) unlock when you swap them on your hero. Keeping them locked would be nice. I don't want to sell my pet on accident because one for this level was better and I forgot to relock it.

b) On the same pet token, it would be nice to see what their ""attack"" does for pets like engineer/medic and faerie. A better tooltip functionality might help with that sort of thing.

c) Maybe I'm missing something, but being able to change the camera while placing a tower so I can see how far the range actually goes would be nice. It would also be nice to see the range when I hit 'e' on the tower to see how upgrades are improving the range.

d) Pet/item respec option would be nice for unique pets.",,False,self,t5_2sf8u,False,,,True,t3_lppxt,http://www.reddit.com/r/dungeondefenders/comments/lppxt/balance_and_quality_of_life_suggestions/,

* Fixed Private Match joining bug. Temporary workaround for 7.06: If you are experiencing issues joining a friends match or friend joining yours, toggle the Show/Hide Match button in the pause menu.
* Increased Squire Tower DPS by 30% from 7.06 (sorry about the over-nerf folks -- some reduction was necessary but that was too much)
* Increased Squire Harpoon, Bowling Ball, &amp; Slicer HP ramps by 25%
* Increased Huntress Piercing Shot Damage Ramp by 15%
* Increased repair speed vs Tower HP (higher HP towers will now repair significantly faster than before, as exponential falloff is applied to the repair time)
* Slice &amp; Dice Tower Z-check will only ignore stuff well above it, not below it (so it'll once again chop goblins and such approaching from below)
* Reduced Kobold explosion AoE to pre-7.06 value

**Dungeon Defenders Updated**

**[7.06 Update Bug fixes / Feature Additions:](http://store.steampowered.com/news/6662/)**

* Rebalanced/redesigned Spooktacular spawns and added Leaderboard &amp; Stats collection - Thanks Tsuda!
* Made Spooktacular skins unlockable by beating Spooktacular on hard (per hero class), though second set of weapons remain Insane-only
* Fixed various Spooktacular mission bugs
* Fixed chatbox getting stuck during level transitions
* Make costume unlock requirements clear in the costume selection
* Allowed mission unlocking/downloads at the mission selection screen
* Reduced self-heal mana cost ramp (cheaper to heal at high HP's now)
* Added ""Drop All Mana"" key, default ""M"" key, and keybinding added to configuration tool
* Fixed problem with Familiar attack rate being effectively capped (there was indeed a bug with this), and renamed the Familiar Attack Rate stat to ""Attack Speed Bonus"". Now high-Attack-Rate familars are way, way, way more effective.
* Made practice dummies average DPS over 5 seconds for a more accurate reading
* Fixed potential double-upgrade bug with superfast mouseclicks
* Moved bonus-item crates back into the main section of the Halloween Tavern, out from the Secret Room
* Added Pause menu option to ""Hide Game"", which delists the game and prevents anyone else from joining it. Useful for turning public match into a private match, or making a private match totally unjoinable even by your friends.
* Fixed bug in algorithm to determine gear stat allocations, that was making high-end gear less likely to have Defense Damage and Defense AoE stats.
* Removed Non-Infinite Build Time Option for Easy, Medium, Hard
* Fixed bug where Squire would turn around when entering block in Chase Cam
* Pets will now attack one of the Practice Dummies in the Tavern so you can check your Pet DPS
* Added button (Default ""G"") to remote-activate your Eternia Crystal so you can begin the Combat phase from wherever you are

**Balancing Changes:**

* Made Genie pet's ""Grant Mana Bonus"" upgradeable, and made him grant more Mana proportionate to how much its ""Grant Mana Bonus"" is upgraded
* Nerfed Spooktacular ""Van Wolfstein"" weapon about 40%, and Huntress Ability 'Piercing Shot' about 30%
* Increased speed of Apprentice Staff ""knockback"" animation by 40%, and increased its maximum (fully charged) damage output by 50%
* Nerfed Bowling Ball &amp; Harpoon Turrets a bit more: bowling ball &amp; harpoon damages ~~reduced by about 33%~~, attack rate reduced by about 25%, bowling ball projectiles now limited to 6 hits before breaking, harpoon projectiles now limited to 12 hits before breaking. 
* Slice and Dice Tower no longer has such a vertical sweep to be effective against enemies above it
* Reduced Energy Drain rates on Electric and Ensnare Monk Auras
* ~~Increased Insane/Post-Insane Kobold Damage by 20% and Kobold Explosion Damage radius by 20%~~
* 20% increase to Spike Blockade HP &amp; its exponential HP ramp
* 30% better exponential damage ramp on Squire Circular Slice
* 40% reduction on Imp/Engy repair costs",,False,self,t5_2sf8u,True,,squire-steam,True,t3_lw0rg,http://www.reddit.com/r/dungeondefenders/comments/lw0rg/dungeon_defenders_706_release_noteschangelog/,

***EDIT: Added what what's in the [Dungeon Defender patch thread](http://forums.trendyent.com/showthread.php?14848) in bold.***

***
7.08
* Added 16-player PvP CTF Pre-Alpha Season Pass ""Frostdale Village"" DLC support.

* Fixed return-to-tavern crash / map-transition crash
* Fixed issue where Costumes would sometimes not be unlocked when completing Halloween Spooktacular!

* Fixed glitch where you could get ""Unlocked New Mission / Costume"" messages on every startup unless you did a local save

* Kobolds should no longer ever phase through blockades

* Raised cap on Monk weapon Ranged Damage stat per upgrade to 85

* Added Insta-Invest button to immediately dump in as much Mana as you can for the next Upgrade level

* Fixed bug where User Interface debug info could appear on-screen by pressing some obscure key combination

* Chain Lightning Tower now immediately retargets to new enemies after killing an enemy. Also its Attack Duration Ramp has been increased by 40%, now you get much longer-hitting lighting towers, and Lightning Tower AOE including max number of chains increased by 10%, and its Max Chain Length increased by 33%

* Uber-Chicken Pet's Damage now scales with Hero Damage and has a reasonable impact AoE, making it a fantastic boast-worthy reward for any Legendary Defender

* Fixed issue where DarkBot and Spanky pets weren't counting towards the ""Gotta Catch Em All!"" Achievement. If you already have those Pets, with this update you will simply need to drop those Pets from your Item Box or Hero, and pick them up or store them again, in order to have them count towards the Achievement.

* Fixed Ogres occasionally getting stuck in creep rooms on Glitterhelm

* Chicken Pet can no longer have poor number of upgrade levels

* Added simplified Monk Auras for low-quality graphics modes

* Enabled Guardians to boost multiple nearby Defenses! This is a new, upgradeable stat on all Guardians (only upgrades once every 10 levels so you need to be packing a high-level Guardian to get the most out of it). Increased Guardian boost-amount exponents by 100% so their Boost-stat value will have more of an effect as well. Enjoy it, it makes Guardians an incredibly powerful buff especially when used in team groupings!

* Auto-lock items picked up from tavern floors

* Reduced enemy ramp by over 60% for Survival Enemies (so a much quicker affair now), but now the Survival/Pure-Strat difficulty ramp vastly increased once you get past Wave 10. Moved Giraffe Pet earning to Wave 25 survival.
***

* **Reduced Van Wolf Damage by 40% more, and Sic damage by 30%, was too OP for what it took to earn them.**

***

###Upcoming Patch! 7.08b 
(Release Date: Nov 10 2011)
7.08b

* Chicken Melee Attack now incorporates Hero Damage as well, and incorporates hero damage at a 20% higher ramp
* Sicarius damage buffed by 30%
* Grenade Launcher Range now limited in Assault / PvP
* Electric Aura Damage Reduced in PvP
* Squire Bloodrage Run Speed increased in PvP
* Fixed bug with swapping heroes with less than 30s on the timer
* Made Survival Enemy Difficulty Ramp easier (but still harder than it was originally)
* Invisible Huntresses now can be affected by PvP Auras
* PvP: Hero Damage down, Hero HP up
* PvP: Squire Bloodrage now yields more of a speedboost
* PvP: Fixed some important latency and bandwidth issues for 16 players

Thread motivated by my mini myth gear resist guide I typed up in a comment.

&gt; **Level 74 DPS Toon Gear Guide**

&gt; For your DPS toon, you want max resist on all 4 elements. For a ""starter"" myth set, you want 50+ upgrades, all 4 resist 10+ starting, hero dps +50 or more, piercing +50 or more, and no negative hero stats. (run spd prob won't matter)... and YES, matching is important. 30% boost to ALL gear stats.

&gt; An ideal piece would have 14+ starting value in all 4 resists, at least 80 hero dps/pierce and no negatives with 80+ ups. You can rarely find these at endless NM HC, and can find them consistently last 3 waves of Misty NM HC.

&gt; First, upgrade the highest starting resist until it is capped. (General resist if 2 or more have good starting value) Hopefully this took 8 upgrades or less. Your 9th or 10th upgrade, you can increase a capped resist. You will be able to increase capped resists every 10 upgrades. So cap best resist, then move on to the next... always watching for the 10th upgrade where you can go back and upgrade a capped resist more.

&gt; Your first 20-30 upgrades will probably be all resist. After you are capped in all 4, start upping hero dps every time except the 10th upgrade. Focus mostly on general resist for these bonus upgrades. Gear with 200+ ups you can balance all 4, but this gear won't be enough - so get your gen resist as high as possible.

&gt; This will give you max 90% resist in all 4 stats in non-NM games... basically making you untouchable unless you try to melee 3-4 ogres at once. (You can almost afk insane UMF)

&gt; Even if it says 90/90/90/90 in shop, keep going. In nightmare having 38-42 gen resist on all 4 pieces will give you 75%+ NM resist instead of 50%.

1343760730.0,30,self.dungeondefenders,xgnzu,The kicking really needs to stop.  (Calling out a fellow redditor),Nacho21,36,6,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/dungeondefenders/comments/xgnzu/the_kicking_really_needs_to_stop_calling_out_a/,"Lately, atlease for me the kicking has gotten really insane.  I completely understand kicking a new player for trying to join a wave 23 nightmare surv run or someone going afk, but the things I have been kicked for/threatened to be are absolutely crazy and people are just power hungry.  

Let me just say that my gear isn't amazing by any means but I get around 10-12mil dps in tavern and have 80%+ all resists in NM.  I can pull some weight basically.

A fellow redditor Wanglah AKA Money on steam, who I thought was a very nice guy just kicked me because he could.  He made a [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/dungeondefenders/comments/x5xmy/offering_help_gearing_for_nightmare_for_the_next/) a couple days back and this is how I first met him.  I just returned to the game when I saw that so thought he was really cool helping everyone out.  Fast-forward a week I haven't talked to him much since then but my gear has vastly improved since then and Ive seen him around in the Reddit steam chat a bit.  

I randomly join a nightmare game from the lobby and Money happens to be the host (it was NM Uber Monster Fest).  I was happy to see him and I tell him how much my gear had improved from last time he saw me, I thought everything was going great.  Throughout the whole thing he is constantly saying g up and upgrade otherwise kick.  A couple people here take more then literally 3 seconds to ready up so he kicks them (About 5 people total while I was there I would guess).  I completely understand this he wants to have a fast run, I don't agree with it but I get it.  Anyways we just finished wave 12/14 the run is going fine and I thought everything was going good.  I was 2nd on scoreboard by a large margin and had been upgrading everytime I had mana.  People the entire time had been picking up loot in between the 3 seconds he gave you ready up so I thought it was ok to grab a piece or 2.  

After wave 12 ends I look up and see the first 2 green items of the entire run (I hadn't picked up a single piece of loot up until this point.)  Since he gave no time to do anything except ready up, I run back to base ASAP (I was at the complete opposite side of the map killing the last one stuck mob, while everyone else was back in the base probably getting a piece of loot or 2).  As soon as I got to the base I picked up the 2 green items ASAP without even looking at the stats so I could g really fast. I may have picked up one extra item on accident but I was far from ""mass looting"" as he called it.  Right after I pick up the 2 items, BOOM I get kicked and thought wtf maybe he misclicked on me or something.  He then messages me on steam:
10:46 AM - Money: mass loot = boot
10:46 AM - Nacho two one: wow ok
10:47 AM - Nacho two one: was just 2 items but ok
10:47 AM - Money: you ran passed me and picked 4 up
10:47 AM - Nacho two one: they were green didnt have time to look
There was someone else behind him, who was picking up a piece of loot as well so it was making the loot sound alot.  He did not ONCE say anything like don't pick up items and people in the previous wave had been picking up stuff no problems.  I thought that since we talked before/being a redditor AND the fact people had been looting that were contributing WAY less then me it would be no big deal.  I would have given him the items I got if he wanted them or even payed mana for them if it was a big deal.  All he would have had to said was not to loot and I wouldn't have grabbed anything no problem at all.

Anyways, this is just one of many games I have been kicked from, but I thought this on in particular was worth sharing. Hopefully atleaes one host will consider everything and try to be nice before using that kick button.

Edit: Im not just directing this as him but to everyone.  This is just one case in many but I think in general kicking is way happening way to often without reason.

TLDR: Just cause you CAN kick doesn't mean you need to do so every 5 seconds.  I guarantee a warning would do or giving a second for someone to react before you kick them will go a long way.

1335741697.0,27,self.dungeondefenders,sytxo,"Two Steps Forward, 3 Steps Back",explodyii,32,5,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/dungeondefenders/comments/sytxo/two_steps_forward_3_steps_back/,"The title explains the basic concept, but let me elaborate my frustrations with this game.

I am a predominantly solo player, being as I play almost exclusively weekdays during normal school/business hours, and over the past month I have made enormous progress from contenting myself with Insane Hardcore campaign maps to farming wave 30 of Misty on Mixed Mode.  Djinn were released around the time I was breaking into the realm of Nightmare Survival, so it was a steep learning curve to get there.

Spiders were always annoying, and required a retooling away from offensively-oriented tower positioning to defensive ones, often drawing significant levels of DU away from the rest of the map.  Djinn further exacerbated this shift, forcing players to invest much more heavily in gas traps covering every lane, and even with fantastic positioning, phenomenal builds, and stats pushing 3k, I find that somewhere in the realm of 80%-90% of the time, djinns still wreaked havok, removing important defenses and the associated buff beams.  Sharken, much like djinn, were released in an absurd state that was nerfed at comical rates not once, but twice within the first days of the latest patch, and like djinn, they have created a scenario where even the best of builds can only stop them *most* of the time.

Now, prior to the latest patch, I was able to farm through the full Misty Mixed Mode Survival, losing somewhere between 10% and 20% of the time with djinn simply getting through gas traps during rearm time.  Instances where djinn would wreak havok but I would recover were prevalent at a significantly higher rate than this.  With sharken, on a map like Misty, I have scaled back from Mixed Mode, started the map at lower levels (17 or so as opposed to 21-23), and I now have a roughly 30% failure rate each wave starting around 20.

My impressions as to why this failure rate is occurring lie in two areas.  Firstly, sharken are much less forgiving than djinn and spiders.  Spiders and djinn come in ""waves"", most noticeably at the end of each wave of a map, with few to no ogres and other enemies.  Sharken, on the other hand, spawn much more periodically, in the midst of ogre rushes, spider rushes, and djinn rushes, where other mobs obfuscate defenses and draw/cover the sharken from towers, thence giving the sharken time to initate charges or increasing the opportunity for the sharken to get through gas traps during rearm times.

Secondly, as a result of the amount of DU that has been drawn away from raw firepower for lane clearing in order to cover from djinn and spiders (and now sharken), mobs are simply alive a lot longer, which compounds the opportunities for things to go wrong with trap gaps, bizarre pathing, or glitched mobs behavior.

Ultimately, there is a very strong ""voice"" in the community that I have read on the forums stating that ""new challenges are good for the game, expanded content adds value to the gameplay experience.""  I absolutely agree, but focus on what this new set of challenges does at each and every release of new content.  Here I am, a perfect anecdotal case of how, instead of being challenged by new content and rewards, I am instead struggling to maintain my already-current level of achievement.  Certainly there are new builds, I have tried many, and certainly there is more powerful gear to obtain that makes content easier, I am further from attaining it than I was prior to the patch.

New builds that the ""voice"" of the TrendyEnt forums point to in order to show how successes are possible (whilst denigrating my own opinions on current content and trends), involve the following: 

1) high-end builders of the following classes:

-TowerHP Series EV

-Buff Beam Series EV

-Traptress

-Squire

-Monk

2) High-end dps Boost Monk

3) End-game pet such as a Mega-Chicken or Trans Monkey

Even then, with each and every one of those classes at a player's disposal, there is a ""slide"", where unless the player has actually maxxed out gear options, they are struggling *more* to achieve *less*.  This does not feel like a new challenge or progression, it feels like what it is: being browbeaten further from ""end-game"" content with each successive patch.

What are possible solutions?  I am sure there are many, and I have my own thoughts on what might work.  A great on was suggested [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/dungeondefenders/comments/sw2eo/two_problems_with_difficulty_levels_one_potential/) by NeuralNomd which has a lot of promise and really does give a better sense of flow in terms of progression, avoiding the ""slide"" I lament.

I am unsure whether this sort of commentary is worth bringing to the Trendy Forums, judging by the vibes most players give off in their snarky quips against complaints.

Is it common knowledge for leveling places, or would this be a good thing that could benefit a lot of people? I don't want to put a ton of work into something to realize that it wasn't really worth it.

**EDIT:** I wanted to be a little more clear up here so people wouldn't have to go comment diving to see more details if they were interested, so here's a little list of things I plan on doing if this happens.

* I plan on going into detail about certain character stat builds. (I'm going to do the initial 1-90 with a Squire, in my opinion it's the easiest solo character, and the one I solo'd up to 70 first)

* I'm going to go through each campaign level and give a good idea on where to place towers. For some of the levels I might give multiple builds to accommodate different playstyles.

* I want to be able to explain what to look for in drops, but I'm not too informed about that, myself. (If someone could help out with that, in early levels should one pick up items with resistances in favor or stats in favor?)

* The entire process will not be in real-time, rather just the important parts. If anything new is introduced to the video then it won't be skipped. If there's a rather repetitive segment, such as just idling until you're level X, it will be skipped over if nothing significant happens in-between.

* I'll give basic game play tips while I go through the process, such as always being aware what the tavern has to sell, G readies you up (I didn't know that until embarrassingly late in the game), and whatever pops up as I go along.

* I plan on doing multiple difficulties. This includes Nightmare mode, and how to get gear to ready yourself for Nightmare mode. (I *might* need help on that if the process changed within the past 4 or 5 months. I know of doing the first few waves on Endless Spires, but I don't know if the new NM mobs changed that at all)

**If anything else is brought up in the comments section, I will clarify it here. Please, please, *please* ask questions if you want to know if I'll do something in my videos. Please mention anything I should add to make it a little more of a fun experience for the viewers (obviously I'm not doing this for myself, I want everyone else to be entertained). Lastly, please tell me if you have any general or specific game play tips. I know a lot about Dungeon Defenders, but I'm not totally up-to-date and may have a lot of missing information.**


EDIT 2: This may take a lot longer than I had hoped... My computer is out of date to say the least so any recording just lags like crazy. It doesn't lag *too bad* when I play the game, but the video itself is terrible. I may have to postpone this until I get a better computer. No ETR for that, sadly. Sorry.

1320683543.0,27,self.dungeondefenders,m3mn3,How to choose a Von Wolfenstein and what makes a good one [Math Inside!],cocquyt,30,3,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/dungeondefenders/comments/m3mn3/how_to_choose_a_von_wolfenstein_and_what_makes_a/,"I've seen many people have questions about VWs who don't know how to find a good one or if the one they have is worth upgrading. Hopefully this will help clear up some questions.

**Some background:**

Von Wolfenstein shoots only electric damage in a + pattern with 5 projectiles, one at each point and one in the middle. This gives them very high damage with a tight spread.

So long as the hero and tower stats on a weapon are not negative, they can usually be ignored. Having better Base Damage will give you better DPS than a worse gun with +Hero Attack. 

The base stats that we will be concerned about are Base Damage, Shots Per Second (SPS) and Projectiles (Proj)

*NOTE: There are 3 other important stats that are not dealt with here: Projectile Speed, Reload Speed, and Clip Size. All of these will increase your DPS and give you a better gun but are impossible to simulate because of real encounters. Reloading while moving from lane to lane can negate low reload, a high reload can negate a small clip size and leading shots can negate low projectiles. Keep these in mind when selecting your VW but they are not part of these numbers.*

There have been some screenshots floating around of hacked VWs with slightly better than perfect stats, but those should be ignored.

***The maximum un-upgraded stats on VWs are:
**
*

* 
70+ Base Damage (have seen some 71's, 75ish is the maximum)
* 
5 SPS
* 
3 Proj
* 
33 Upgrade levels

Every VW should max SPS and Proj for maximum damage. The maximum for these stats is 6 SPS and 4 Proj.

By knowing these numbers we can break every VW down into 2 numbers, Base Damage and Effective Upgrades (EUPS).

We can find EUPS with the Number of Upgrades (UPS)+(SPS-6)+(Proj-4)

This gives us the number of upgrades available to increase Base Damage and allows us to compare VWs with different stats.

With this, the maximum amount of EUPS is 31 (33+5-6+3-4)

The following is the damage of VWs from 30 to 75 Base Damage over the 31 possible EUPS.

[Overall VW Damage](http://i.imgur.com/bkyTJ.png)

As we can see, they all scale exponentially at first but quickly reach the +40 damage per upgrade cap.

We can also see that as the Base Damage increases, the difference between the final damage decreases for each 5 Base Damage Increase. Because of this, higher base damage (60+) suffer from severe diminishing returns.

Looking at the high levels of EUPS, the damage increase is linear with each upgrade increasing by 40.

[VW Damage from EUPS 25-31](http://i.imgur.com/ZXQex)

The difference between 70 and 60 Base Damage is worth ~1 EUPS

The difference between 50 and 60 is ~1.5 EUPS

**Because of this, a 55 Base Damage, 33 UPS VW will be *better* than a 70 Base Damage, 31 UPS VW**

This also means that a 55 Base Damage/33 UPS/4 SPS/3 Proj Von Wolf will be better than a 70 Base Damage/33 UPS/3 SPS/2 Proj Von Wolf.

With Base damage being so much less valuable than EUPS, lets take a look at the first 6 EUPS.

[VW Damage from EUPS 0-6](http://i.imgur.com/4lUST)

As we can see, it takes the 30 Base Damage 6 EUPS to reach 70. Because the damage per level is exponential, lower Base Damage VWs will suffer *much more* than higher ones and the difference between the 5 points from 30-35 and 60-65 is huge.

The difference between final damage of 65 and 70 Base Damage at 31 EUPS is 22 (1098 and 1120)

The difference between final damage of 35 and 40 Base Damage at 31 EUPS is 38 (920 and 958)

**TL;DR/Conclusion:
Above 45-50 base damage, Upgrades + Shots Per Second + Projectiles is the most important number on a Von Wolf. Above 60 Base Damage has severe diminishing returns, Base Damage under 40 Sucks**

[Edit: Spreadsheet with math](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AuMojA2w0-HfdEdpbGZwckEwN1RwRHNvZjBrSGJhWGc)

[Edit 2: I suck and forgot this. Here is the calculator for VWs. Thanks for the reminder burny209](http://www.dd.fiftycal.net/calcs/vanWolf.php)

Edit 3: One last tidbit, the quality of a VW is not that important for these calculations. I'm using a 33 UPS Legendary VW that is over 1004 Damage. Just because it's not a Godly, don't dismiss them without looking at the stats.

I was at work when the new map was released, and so spent some time reading up on how others had fared so far, to get an idea as to what would await me later that night.  

""Aha,"" 

I thought to myself, 

""Here I have found some threads where people advise the use of the Portal Gun, to simplify this difficult map!  What fun I shall have when I share this ingenious strategy with my fellow players tonight.""

Little did I know, there was no fun to be had this night.  Friends, *The Etherian Festival of Love, Sky O' Love Challenge Mission* is where fun goes to die.

I joined a group of fellow lvl 74s and quickly impressed the other players with the basic idea I had taken from reddit: Using 6 magic Blockades, construct a Love Shack under the lowest, central bridge, with a Strength Drain Aura on top to make the magic last longer.  Then, 1 or 2 of us will teleport the new couples together while the others tend to the Magic Missles, Proximity mines and barricades guarding our crystals.  We were all specced out decently in medium mythical gear, with both DPS and Tower builders having stats in the 700s.

A simple enough plan.  We were excited.  Were optimistic.  We were fools.

In the end, we spent 3 hours, involving one disconnect/crash that forced us to start over, culminating in a mob of Ogres destroying one of the crystals on wave 8.  We never completed the mission.  At the tavern, afterwards, we realized it was past 1 am.  But the time wasn't important.  Our willpower was broken, our souls were tarnished.  Some of us questioned whether we would ever truly be able to love again, after what we went through.  We each quietly left in turn, forever changed by our shared experience.

This was on **Medium** difficulty.

For those you read it last week, I made a post about how annoyingly long Survival maps could be. The issue was : sometimes you just want to be able to take a break and resume your game later, especially when you've already spent 3 hours on this exact survival map.

Anyways, another problem came up with the Halloween challenge. This map is long. I haven't timed it but I'd say between 1 and 2 hours due to the large amount of creatures coming at you.

The problem is : I haven't been able to finish it with my brother. He's the host.

* He got disconnected during the last wave.
* We had to start from the beginning : His game crashed during the second-to-last game.
* He hosted again. An ogre got stuck in a pumpkin (not related to this issue but still wanted to point this bug out).
* So this time I try hosting : I got disconnected (first time of the day, of course) during the second-to-last wave.

We just gave up. We don't really have itnernet issue. It happens to just get disconnected. Add bad luck to this and this is what you get. I'm sure many people here had to deal with the same issues. Getting disconnected on a 10-minute map is no big deal. On a 1-hour-long map, it's a bigger issue.


My suggestion would be to add a ""Resume your last game"" option. Here me out :

**What does it do ?**

*It allows you to resume your last game almost where you left it.*

**Does that apply to any game ?**

*Yes it does. Whether you crashed during a game or decided to ""Exit the map"", this option will be available*

**Where can you ""Resume your last game"" ?**

*In the tavern, on the map selection menu, you will be able to click on ""Resume your last game"".*

**Can you have several game ""paused"" ?**

*No you can't. If you start a new mission (and therefore do not select ""Resume your last game""), you will get a pop-up message saying ""Starting a new mission will overwrite your paused mission"" (or something like that)*

**Does the save bring you back to the last building phase?**

*No, because that would mean it's exploitable. As in : ""Oh noes, we are failing the 25th wave of this survival map. Let us quit and try again because the save allows us to go back to our last build phase. THAT would be a problem.*

*The game does have some frequent saves. Let's say : You loot something during the combat phase, you get disonnected 1 minute after that... chances are, you'll still have the item in your inventory. If you loot it and get instantly disconnected, chances are it won't be in your bags. The point is : the game already has some ""in-game autosave"" implemented for characters. The best solution would be to add it for the map/game ITSELF. Therefore :*

* *If the game crashed/got disconnected, you'd start about where you left it. Be it a build or combat phase.*
* *If you quited the game, you start it back EXACTLY where you left it.*

**Worried about people using that to have more time to plan their tower placements for Insane ?**

*No, people plan beforehand. That would make no difference.*

**Is the game saved for everyone ?**

*No, only the host has the ""saved game"". If you join a map on a server, get disconnected and go host your own game, you will not be able to ""resume"" the one of the other serveur*

**If I have a ""saved game"" and go play on a server, does it erase it ?**

*No it doesn't. Since the maps aren't saved on your side (because you're not the host), it doesn't erase youre save. It erases your save only if you are the host and start a NEW map.*

**What about the number of creatures ?**

*You hosted a 4 player game and crashed. As we all know : 4 players = more creatures. You decide to host again, but this time you're alone. What happens ?*


* *If your last auto-save was during build phase : no problem. The amount of creatures adjusts itself like it normally would.*

* *If your last auto-save was during combat phase : You'll have to wait until the build phase to see their number decreases. Basically, it's like a normal game. When your friends leave during the combat phase, the creatures don't disappear (I think).*

What do you guys think ?

Edit: Hey guys. I'll probably do it at 8pm Eastern Time Zone (Figure out what time this is for your own time zone) (Thursday). For those of you who are messaging me on steam, sorry I can't respond. I seriously get a good 50 messages an hour at the least. 

For whichever one of you joined my private shop, and then picked up a ton of the mythical items that I was going to give away, go fuck yourself. I'm already short enough on time and now I have to do another run because you're a douche. 

Kthx. 

Edit2:

It looks like I'm gonna have to supply about 200 people items for this, way bigger than I expected! As such, when this happens I will make a private game at the time specified, and just keep trying to join my game. Come in, purchase 1, MAYBE 2 items at the 100 mana cost, and then leave so that everyone can come in.

Just doing this to help out the community, perhaps somebody will find this interesting / useful.

Ask me anything from Tower Placement / Map Strats, the strongest hero combos at the moment (Metagame) to itemisation and ""perfect"" stats for items.

Not sure how ramping on upgrades work? I'm your guy.

They are:

- Each message can be a total of 64 characters in length. That is not enough.

This is frequently insufficient for explanations and I find myself having to finish them in a second message. I understand you want text to fit on even the smaller resolution screens, but what's wrong with word-wrapping onto a new line?

- The rate-limiter that limits how quickly you can send messages is too slow. 

When I run into the first problem (short message length) and attempt to finish my sentence in a second message, it frequently gets blocked and does not show up. I type an average of 100wpm, as do many people these days, and it's frustrating to have to re-type things because the game decided I was typing too fast.

Would it be possible to either increase the maximum message length, decrease the minimum time between messages, or both?

Let's look at the recently released gotham city imposters, you can obtain everything in the game but it becomes a BRUTAL grind to without getting anything from the cash shop which sneakily masquerades as DLC.

Dungeon Defenders is the same price as gotham city imposters. You can't obtain any characters outside the base 4 in dungeon defenders without buying the DLC. Continuing your story mode missions? Fuck you, buy mistymire DLC. Oh dude, you want to play on a harder difficulty outside of insane? Fuck you, buy mistymire DLC. When EV drops (WHO I'M EFFING STOKED FOR) probably will have to buy her with DLC. Assault Maps? Fuck you DLC.

Basically, while Trendy isn't being as underhanded as Gotham City Imposters, I do feel that the value for purchasing the base game without DLC is dwindling as they release some more.

I'd first like to thank the devs for creating this enjoyable and immensely fun, time-consuming game!



That said, my first character is a monk, and I'm having trouble with auras, I usually stack them to have maximum effect along with other towers but I've had trouble in upgrading specific ones. Currently the game prioritizes the lowest level tower for upgrades and the most damaged ones for repair. The current solution is to skew them in position so that there will be an area where only one of them is available.

If it's possible I hope you can make a feature where we can cycle through the towers that overlap a same space with a key (maybe tab or something else)

Since I've been searching for a solution, I've found that people have had the same problems as well, [so here's a more detailed explanation (with pics!) on the problem I'm experiencing](http://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/32974/is-there-an-easier-way-to-repair-upgrade-sell-overlapping-defenses)

Similar to the original keyboard-only and gamepad emulators, this is simply a .dll file that's ""installed"" by dropping it in the ""Binaries\Win32"" folder of Dungeon Defenders...

What makes this emulator so special, though, is that **it allows you to control all 4 player slots with the keyboard *and* mouse** (something that hasn't been possible until now). You simply change control of characters with the F1 to F4 keys, and almost everything else is controlled the same way that you're used to playing; using the mouse to look around, using LMB and RMB to fire/alt-fire, middle button, etc... Hit the letter ""O"" to Start, and XY/AB is emulated with keys as well.

It's not perfect yet (no way to ready-up by hitting G for the 3 alt players, unable to rebind keys), but so far it's the best alternative to hit the community, in my opinion. Here's the link, with instructions:

1324073273.0,20,self.dungeondefenders,nfntg,"My thoughts on Trendys ""DLC"".",Volkamar,41,21,77,http://www.reddit.com/r/dungeondefenders/comments/nfntg/my_thoughts_on_trendys_dlc/,"OK, so I am going to put this on the record right now, because it has come to my attention that some people are just either dumb or cannot see past their own noses at what is going on.



Trendy is, and continues to, constantly coming up with new ones to try and milk this game for as much as humanly possible. They are announcing contents within the PATCH NOTES (Keyword here), without any mention of DLC, then deciding at the last minute that a certain part of this patch you will have to pay for. Why are they doing this. Do they simply want to create discussion by including it all the patch? Or could it be something more  subtle that they're seeing what parts of the patch are generating the most interest and then taking that and then charging you for it? Whatever it is, this practice is wrong and deceitful in my opinion, and I am finding it harder and harder to continue supporting a company who insists on nickel-and-dimeing the player base which is helping to keep them afloat and giving them the success that they have been getting.



But the arguments for what Trendy have done is what gets me more, and it just shows without question, that most the people cannot see what exactly is going on. Some say things such as ""Oh, it's just the price of a Sandwich, What are you too poor to get this or something. It's barely anything."", and yes while the content itself is cheap, there are two resounding facts that have been neglected in this argument. The first is that $4 for Gender Swaps with new Abilities, is a lot of money, when you compare it to the fact that the game is around $12. Not only that, but it's not that it's the price of a Sandwich that I am paying to get the optimal playing experience, it's ANOTHER price of a Sandwich that I am paying to get the optimal playing experience. Just look at the numbers since the time Trendy released Dungeon Defenders, and take into account please, that the game has only been out just over a Month or so now.

* The Game Dungeon Defenders, in the UK, costs £9.99 and Pre-Orders were £8.99.
* To get all the content from the game via it's DLC, you need to pay; £3.49 for the new Classes/Gender Swaps, £1.59 for the Warping Core Pack, and if you want to experience Nightmare Mode you need to pay a Whopping £7.49. That is around £12.50's worth of DLC, £11's of it could well be considered essential, as it changes the very way we play and experience the game.

AND THIS IS JUST FROM THE FIRST MONTH. If the game was Free to Play I could perhaps understand, but the fact we had to pay £10 on top of all of this in just the first month, makes me worried about how much more we're going to be expected to shell out just to experience the key parts of the game as they are released. Hell, even Subscription based games like WoW or Rift are more merciful at this present stage, What does THAT say to you?



Another argument that seems to come up a lot is ""But they're an Indie Developer, they have to make money somehow for making all this new content, don't be a fag (DISCLAIMER: The word fag is used humorously and it not the literal exclamation of this portion of the play base.) it's only $5."" You wanna know who else is an Indie Developer? Re-Logic, the guys behind Terraria, you may have heard of them. Possibly. They just recently released Patch 1.1 for their game, which radically changed the very way that the game is experienced and adds a whole new Tier of gameplay with over a hundred new items, new NPCs, new Monsters, New Bosses, and new Environments to experience and explore. You want to know how much this cost? NOTHING! Absolutely nothing! It was in the Patch Notes and it came out, as a patch, with no money required from your wallet in order to experience this new content bristling with new possibilities and entertainment. This is almost the exact opposite to what Trendy have done and what looks as if they will continue to do.



The last main point that people seem to bring up is ""I can justify paying for this because I have put over 100+ Hours into the game."", but I have to ask, Are you saying that because of the fact that you yourself can justify spending that money because that game has thus far given you a lot of entertainment for you money? Or are you saying that in the sense that, ""I have put 100+ Hours into the game and this new content drastically changes how we played the game, I don't want to fall behind or become obsolete, so I guess I should get the DLC to avoid such a fate."" (Because, let's face it, it's either that or grinding to buy them for extortionate Mana Costs at the Player-made Shops). How many of you, honestly bought this, thinking that you don't want to fall behind or feel that the hundreds of hours you put into getting the gear that was, at that time, the best you could get or at least close to has been put to waste because the new stuff is astronomically better in every possible respect? Because i'd like to think that number is a lot higher than most people would initially think, especially given the very grindy nature of the game, that thrives off of spoon feeding you little rewards. A bit of gear here, a new weapon there, maybe even a new Pet.



The fact of the matter is, Trendy have taken a path which in all honesty, I am having difficulty bringing myself to support. Which is a damn shame because I enjoy this game a lot, and to an extent, still do don't get me wrong. They will likely continue to place content in the guise of Patch Notes to generate interest and have people say ""Oh wow! Check out what this next patch will have. New Difficulty Modes and Brand New Maps. IT'S JOY!"", then all of a sudden turn around and say, ""Here you go guys, here's the new patch, oh but if you want this part of the Patch that you were talking about so admirably, then you're going to have to give us some more money."". The question is, How long are you going to deem this practice as acceptable?



So you might ask, ""Well you're just ranting and complaining and offering nothing in the way of a solution."", so let me dispel that whilst I am here. The first thing Trendy could do, is tell us what is going to be DLC, and keep it SEPERATE from the Patch Notes. At least that way they would not be coming off as deceitful and the idea of paying for the DLC is a lot easier to stomach as a result. The second thing, is to perhaps revise the pricing or even what they put in as DLC. Perhaps leave the core parts of the game like new difficulty modes and perhaps even new maps out of DLC and make them available to everyone. But stuff like extra Costumes, i'm ok with having that as DLC, as it doesn't directly impact how the game is played. I would be more than happy with that, in fact I would probably shell in, since of the costumes are really quite good. Those are just a couple of suggestions that I would place on the table.



Anyway, that about covers it. Many thanks for taking the time to read this and I look forward to any insightful responses you may have.

It appears that it's not an issue of Apprentice towers vs. the other classes, but simply that *upgrading a tower built by a tower-spec hero is **far** less benificial than upgrading a tower built by a non-tower spec hero*, which I think is absolutely ridiculous. All Tower-specced classes should get a larger benifit from upgrading their towers than they currently do, in my opinion. It's really ridiculous to sink almost 3,000 mana into a tower to get a ~12% boost to stats. It'd be really fantastic if a Trendy employee would comment on why upgrading towers with a Tower spec does so little. 


From the latest patch notes:

* Improved Apprentice Defense Attack Rate ramp further, now you gain major Attack Rate DPS benefits well into the 100's of Attack Rate points

That's fantastic, and we're definitely getting there, but the real problem with Apprentices are that *our Tower Upgrades to jack shit*. 

Let's take Fireball Tower, for example. 
On my Apprentice a Level 1 Fireball tower has these stats:

**2011 Attack Damage, 19.66 Range, 0.72 Attack Rate. **

At level 6 (Maximum Level), it has:

**2295 Attack Damage, 21.30 Range, 0.61 Attack Rate.**

While my Squire's Harpoon Tower goes from:

**1149 Damage, 16.81 Range, 1.04 Attack Rate**

To: 

**1950 Damage, 21.31 Range, 0.78 Attack Rate**


So, from Level 1 to Level 6 the Apprentice's tower gains:

**14% more Attack Damage, 8% more Range and 18% more Attack Rate. **

While the Squire's tower gains:

**70% more Attack Damage, 26% more Range and 33% more Attack Rate!**

Our towers simply do not scale well *At all* with levels, making us pretty useless at the later waves &amp; higher difficulties. I have all this mana and I just don't even bother spending it to upgrade my towers because it's not worth it at all. If I can't do a map with level 0 towers I can't do it at all.

I assumed they were talking about League of Legends as they often do, a game which I do not play.

So eventually I look over to my steam friends list and see that they are all in this ""Dungeon Defenders"" instead. A game I've never heard of. I ask what it is, and they describe a generic tower defense game. I say, that could be fun, but its probably not worth $15.

They tell me to try the demo, and if I like it they'll play with me. I was very curious about what they meant by play *with* them, as I've never played a multiplayer Tower Defense game before.

Money is tight this month, I had to spend $500 to fix my car, and I'm saving for my wedding. So I figure I'll try the demo and be done with it. I get the demo, play one round as Apprentice...

Then I buy the game and make a Huntress. This was about 9pm. At 8am we finally beat Castle Armory, I've hit level 16, and I have to go to bed because I'm falling asleep in my computer chair. This is the first time I've pulled an all nighter for a video game in years.

This game is just amazingly fun. I can't wait to play it again tonight, and in fact I may be leveling a squire up solo today while I wait for my friends to get home.

The post about the patch is a perfect way to discuss the changes, and how to use them best in different situations. Instead, it's one big set of complaining players, thinking anything taken from them was one big skeme to piss them off. things like weird ways to generate mana from nothing, or a clearly overpowered weapon that's very easy to obtain.

How do you think i felt when i woke up, fired up steam and all my huntress weapons were useless cause they were max upgraded already and the projectile speed got nerfed? That's right, i felt like shit. But i understood there wasn't a single thing i could do about it, and I UNDERSTOOD WHY THEY DID IT.

Next time you feel like talking crap about a game you like, think about WHY they changed it. If you don't understand why, ask around. If you don't like the game, unsubscribe, it's the button on the right hand side.

Don't just think about the impact the patch has for you and your gear, or your storage of mana obtained by exploiting a glitch. It's for the greater good, the balance in the game.

- You don't know how to hide a public game or make a private game and have steam friends join you. You also name your game something like ""DO NOT JOIN OR KICK"", or ""join and i VAC ban you"".
- You consistantly whinge about how hard nightmare is, but only because you don't know the full story as to why we can even play nightmare mode right now.
- You play on Open and think it is somehow more legit than Ranked, or claim that ""Ranked has just as many hackers as Open so it doesn't matter"".
- You think that DefendersStore is updated in real-time or a great way to quickly aquire items in its current state of deployment.

And a bonus:

- You don't understand how the loot dropping system works nor realise how much mana you are losing because you don't understand it. Extra points if you kick people for taking generic loot early on in waves with several thousand mobs. (I estimate that collecting loot and maxing your inventory each wave is between 8 and 10 times more profitable than waiting for loot to 'improve' as 'poor' drops are removed and replaced when the drop cap is reached.)

Edit: [Since I've already been called a cunt:](http://www.reddit.com/r/dungeondefenders/comments/okudy/ten_signs_you_are_a_noob_at_dd_or_how_to_not_look/c3i1z5t)

Fast transitions is in the main game options (turn off Camera Shake while you are there too :/ ). Push-to-talk is in the voice preferences, you can rebind it from Left Alt in the game launcher screen by pressing Configure (You don't want it as Left Alt since you probably are using that with the Tab key to minimise the game). Push G to show  you are ready to start a wave from any map location. Press Escape-&gt; (Select a character) -&gt; Show info, instead of running up to people to see their stats and gear. To Hide a public game press Escape -&gt;  Hide Match (this will not stop steam friends from joining). To create a absolutely private game, host a private match and press Hide Match. Nightmare mode was only released early - as a bonus to those with the complete DLC set preordered - because it was aimed at experienced players who were finding insane too easy and who wanted a challenge. It was originally aimed for release with the 4th eternia shard DLC when we were all running around with level 80 characters, more powerful weapons armor and pets, and with significantly higher (&lt;1000) stats.

The bonus tip refers to how the game manages dropped loot when there are many hundreds or thousands of mobs per wave. There is a limit to the quantity of loot that is on the map floor at any point in time. You can even see loot dissapearing if you watch carefully during combat or, more easily, watch the grey dots while the map is showing. 

A lot of people are under the impression that the map holds infinite loot which is all perfectly converted into mana at the beginning of each round. This is not true for larger waves (more than a few hundred mobs). Older crappier loot is removed as 'better' (what the game considers better, anyway, probably by item price) items drop. Although its true that the map-average loot quality progressively improves during each wave, it is still far more profitable to pick up ALL the things at any stage of the wave rather than just leaving it sitting there. You tend to make more if you pick up later in the waves than earlier, as I mentioned this is because of item values. Many hosts are fine with looting, but often will tell players to stop looting when a certain number of mobs remain. I often see this number being the last 500-1000 mobs but in some modes (mix mode for example) even a few hundred remaining mobs might be sufficient to replenish ALL the loot on the map so that each player still gets some instant mana when the next round begins. The downside of this is that you'll tire of pressing E to collect page upon page of inventory loot, I rebound my E key to a mouse thumb button for comfort.

Before learning about it, I invested 1 billion mana in my stats only to find myself doing worse than I was earlier in the week (now I know why). So for those of you that don't understand what the big deal is, it's the fact that players have lost a significant amount of progress they've made, with no explanation from Trendy and no indication that it won't happen again in the future. Why bother building your stats if they're just going to move the goalposts?

Anyway, rant over. I thought I'd test the damage output of towers now to determine how to change my strategies (if I decide to continue playing--I really am that frustrated right now). Here's what I found:

Tower | DPS | DPS/Defense Unit
:--|:--|:--
Magic Missile | 12820 | 4273
Fireball | 30107 | 6021
Deadly Striker | 30107 | 3763
Lightning | 6624 (per target) | 946 (per target)

So the clear winner is Fireball towers now (even more so than before). It's also really hard to justify a Deadly Striker now unless you really need the range. And of course it's a little harder to compare lightning towers since their effectiveness depends on how many chains you can get. I haven't tested it mathematically or in-game, but my instinct is that lightning auras might be a better choice now. I'd definitely like some feedback on that, if anyone knows.

Hopefully this helps everyone adjust their strategies.",,False,self,t5_2sf8u,True,,,True,t3_p6t3g,http://www.reddit.com/r/dungeondefenders/comments/p6t3g/some_testing_of_the_new_apprentice_towers/,

1320115922.0,15,self.dungeondefenders,lvzus,"I just logged my 100th hour into this game, and I thought I could offer my total evaluation to those interested. ",Pinbenterjamin,19,4,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/dungeondefenders/comments/lvzus/i_just_logged_my_100th_hour_into_this_game_and_i/,"* **Personal Review:**


Slowly, but surely, I watch money from my bank account siphon into Steam's. Over the past couple of years I've nearly purchased two hundred games, and it goes without saying that they all warrant their own critiques. 


Enter: **Dungeon Defenders**, a game which for a long period of time before release had been in the Steam store, just sitting idle with a few screen captures available to look at. It peaked my interest then, and I followed Trendy across their sparse, but informative development updates, and even purchased the version for mobile devices. The premise of ""tower defense"" games was new to me, and relatively speaking, is still now. I like the mix of strategy and positioning. What towers work best where, and which locations make for the best 'chokes'. 

So, you may be wondering: ""Ok, well, what did you actually *think* about the game?""

Needless to say, one does not play a game for one hundred hours if it's not being enjoyed. But let me tell you something that this game does wonderfully, that is wholly lost elsewhere in gaming: The *incentive to play*.

In a world that rewards purchase over progress, a game like Dungeon Defenders, which currently does not have any extra costs aside from the first buy of the game, does remarkably well providing incentives to continue playing. Merely reaching max level, or completing the game's main story does not even come close to the total one can achieve. All main missions and challenges have four difficulty levels, each rewarding on a different scale, with different weapons that vary in size, and attributes. Just leveling up your character to max will not provide a similar character as the rest of the community, as each individual piece of gear worn by the hero has its' own level, which in turn, can me raised to further buff your statistics. There are many unique pets that offer abilities from attacking, to buffing the hero, and bonuses to wearing similar types of gear that will have you searching through hundreds of helmets, vets, and gloves for exactly the right fit. 


But for me, the kicker is: you have to earn all of it. There is no way to improve other than to play. And that is what really immerses me into a game.  

You could dedicate an entire article to the art style, and aesthetics of this game, which are beyond beautiful. But for now, I'll just let you know: Truly, amazing job.

And the Tavern? Wow. Awesome.


* ** As an avid player, things I hope to see:**

*Disclaimer: I understand that not all these are easily implemented, but I hope that some how, they reach Trendy's eyes for development later in their, hopefully long, life.* 

1. Personal stat tracking, featuring things like ""total kills"" ""total mana collected"" ""total missions completed. Not the per-stage system now.

2. Non-buffing titles given out to those that have achieved tough goals. Things like ""50k Monster Kills"" and ""All Missions completed on hard"".

3. Staying away from DLC that gives the player anything. Offering DLC like the Halloween event was brilliant. Reward for play, not for pay.

4. Raise the level cap higher, but make it extremely difficult to reach maximum. Your game will not feel like a grind.

5. Implement more achievements that could customize the tavern with completion. There wouldn't be anything more amazing than to join someone's server and see post cards from completed levels, or heads of bosses mounted to the wall.

6. I know it's coming, but costume unlocks! 

7. Allow players to dump mana into structures to upgrade them the same when you can armor and weapons. And have a casting system similar to World of Warcraft and other MMORPGs, where if you get hit by casting, the bar either resets, or gets thrown back an increment. 



Thank you so much for making this game Trendy! I look forward to future patches!

1319861484.0,16,self.dungeondefenders,lsy33,Volo's guide to farming hard Glitterhelm with a Tower Squire.,volothebard,17,1,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/dungeondefenders/comments/lsy33/volos_guide_to_farming_hard_glitterhelm_with_a/,"This is a guide for people starting out farming this monster of a map. Pro's will already have their own ways and I'm not pretending to teach them anything. Also I'd like to apologize for my skills with Paint, they suck I know. using these methods you will have around 30-40 extra DU's to play with so if your stats are a bit lower than mine (I'll post them at the end) then feel free to double up on the defenses here and there.

First we start with the [map](http://imgur.com/ekZjq) 

A B C D are the crystals, numbers 1-7 are points of interest.

[A.](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197994182762/screenshot/631855309509969339/?tab=public) You also might want to place another crossbow facing the one I have here. Your main danger on this map is not wyverns but Assassins. They like to come up from behind and rape your crossbows. With dual crossbows at this point you can pretty much leave this entire area alone.

[B.](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197994182762/screenshot/631855309509970592/?tab=public) The Slice N dice is optional. Many times you will do this map and a creature will never come down those stairs. Every once in a while a goblin or assasin might make his way there so I place the SnD so I can ignore this area. Feel free to pile on more crossbows as well as this will be where the heaviest concentration of Wyverns will harrass you. 

[C.](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197994182762/screenshot/631855309509970191/?tab=public) Crystal C is your chill place. Not much should get to this crystal and it's a nice place to sit while holding shift to observe your towers health. I stay here unless a lane gets dual Ogres or an assassin slips through somewhere. Try to keep full mana so you can pop rage and run to any area that might need help. Also, see that spawn window showing 2 wyverns? That's where you see the random spawns for this map. Always be checking it to see how many ogres you have to deal with. Wyverns should not ever make it to this crystal but if you get nervous feel free to guard it with a crossbow.

[D.](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197994182762/screenshot/631855309509968616/?tab=public) D is an easy crystal to guard especially if, like me, you spend most of your time at C. You'll notice I don't even place defenses on the ""back"" stair side as all the creatures that spawn from that side go to C. Every great once in a while a goblin might get lost and head that way but it's not worth guarding against. Just pop rage get there and kill it. Also, this crystal will never be harassed by wyverns.

[1.](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197994182762/screenshot/631855309509966597/?tab=public) This is your main problem area for the map. Feel free to put 3 or 4 crossbows here but usually 2 is enough. If you get double ogres here and you are on the other side of the map, even popping rage may not be enough. Also this area will have assassin problems so like I said earlier, feel free to double up crossbows at A.

[2.](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197994182762/screenshot/631855309509969782/?tab=public) Often the single Cannon is enough but I like putting the bow there since it is an ""outskirt"" area and I may be elsewhere when it gets hit by double ogres. I have never lost this position though so I wouldn't worry about it too much.

[3.](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197994182762/screenshot/631855309509967458/?tab=public) Pretty easy area to defend made doubly so by my tendency to camp C. if your tower range is large feel free to place one of those bows on the top right rail so it can get any summoners that tend to hide behind the corner.

[4.](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197994182762/screenshot/631855309509969007/?tab=public) Another trouble area. Lots of ogres tend to spawn here so keep an eye out. Also, you can't really tell from the pic but place one more crossbow at the top of the stairs to the left (as my guy faces) pointing towards the spawn. It will never get attacked and will help against summoners that might hide behind the corner.

[5.](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197994182762/screenshot/631855309509967842/?tab=public) Not a hard area to defend, but be sure to keep an eye out for double Ogres. It's an outlying defense so be sure to keep mana full to pop rage if you are far away.

[6.] No picture to add here, just wanted to reiterate that you don't really need any defense here as nothing comes this way.

[7.](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197994182762/screenshot/631855309509967030/?tab=public) Again, the SnD isn't really necessary as it's very rare that anything comes this way, but I'm a lazy tower squire so the less I have to personally deal with the southern part of the map the better.

So doing just what I have pictured here you will only use 125 of 165 DUs. That gives you 40 to play around with. Also you will notice I do not use cannons that much, or Slice N Dices. If you wanted to replace a couple of bouncers or arrows with them you would have the DUs to do so.

My Squire stats are

Tower Health: 110

Tower Attack: 168

Tower Speed: 125

Tower Range: 48

Squire Casting speed: 70

Squire Walk Speed: 40

As for weapons I use a High Five to help me deal with Ogres and I use a Djinn pet to fuel rage. I started doing hard Glitter at around level 45 or so, I'm sure it can be done before then too. As for upgrading, when I was lower level I made it a priority to upgrade the crossbows that guarded the crystals to handle the wyverns. Now that I am comfortable with my stats I usually just have everything upgraded to level 2 or so by the final wave.

Few other things, Why Hard Glitter and not ramparts? Well for a change of scenery, but also Glitter has 2 extra waves and a LOT more creatures per wave. I usually gain 200-300k or so mana when farming Ramparts, on glitter it is rare that I get less than 400k, I've hit 600k on lucky runs. XP as well is a lot better, until the 60's I was gaining almost a level a wave. Also, I try to grab as many chests as possible, not for the mana (my djinn takes care of those needs) but the chests on Hard Glitter can drop godly's. I usually get 1 every four runs or so.

Edit: One small thing I want to add about the wyverns. When placing your harpoons at A and B be sure to place the Harpoons behind the crystal from the direction the wyverns fly from. If you place the harpoons in the path of the wyverns, every now and then a wyvern will get through to the harpoon and start killing it. Often if a wyvern is on top of a harpoon attacking it the harpoon cannot fire and will sit there and die. So to stop that from happening you want to use the crystals as ""bait"". This is not a strategy you would ever want to use on insane, where crystal damage is kept from round to round, but it makes running hard a lot easier since the crystals heal at the end of the round.

I've played a lot of games using the Unreal Engine before, although I've never really messed with .ini settings for these games because they always ran fine for me. However, the above-mentioned thread got my attention because it was so helpful, and I started researching what other values I could tweak to enhance my gameplay experience, not only in the UDKEngine.ini, but among the other .ini files as well...

As far as the graphics rendering engine alone, I found these links to be especially helpful, whether it came to improving visuals or trying to optimize performance:

http://www.tweakguides.com/UT3_8.html (check out the other pages too)
http://udn.epicgames.com/Three/UE3Basics.html

I've been looking through the various .ini files and I've seen some interesting-looking values, like a lot of UI stuff. I'm wondering if any of these can be tweaked to change things like UI animation speed and other interesting things. And as far as graphics, there are quite a lot of other values not addressed in the above-mentioned post; things that could potentially be used to improve FPS and tweak other various aspects of the rendering engine.

Can we start pooling our knowledge regarding Dungeon Defenders .ini tweaks here? I know the API/editing kit will be released within the next week or so, and there will probably be some crossover regarding what can be tweaked with .ini configurations vs. mods, although I still believe documenting the .ini stuff is a worthwhile endeavor.

(And c'mon... there has to be at least a *few* UDK gurus on Reddit, right?)

Combining fireball and magic missile towers, backed up by a sniper tower, at the chokepoints is much stronger than it used to be, and is just slightly less effective than 3 153 damage-stat cannonball towers at the same place.

I haven't tried a lightning tower yet, simply because there hasn't been a reason to, though it is possible it could be even more beneficial than the DST at certain chokepoints. The circular aoe aspect of it is slightly awkward, as in most cases it just ends up being an expensive tower with about the range of MM. The role of the tower seems to be CC, but I'm not too sure how able it is to fill that role. I wonder if something like a frost (or because there is no frost element in this game, poison) tower with an aoe slow element would be less awkward? Like a fireball tower with about 1/4 the damage, 1/2 the attack rate (twice as long), 1/2 to 3/4 the range, scary green magic and a slow. Such a tower would nicely round out the apprentice's arsenal, but at the same time possibly send some monk players into deep sadness. And it seems I have rambled..

There are two distinct problems I'm seeing here. 

1) Each gear level seems like it requires THAT gear level to obtain. I need good myths to have the stats to farm myths reliably. I need good trans to have the stats to farm trans reliably.

To me this seems absolutely counter productive, i might as well farm mana in dumb ass survivals that i've beat countless times over and just buy new geat from those @ the top.

2) The status quo gets absolutely fucked with. I understand the desire to make new challenges and harder things to overcome, which is COOL. The problem is, with nightmare mode adding the new elite mobs from each tier, old things I used to be able to do to earn mana or farm x or y are no longer fiesable, and now progressing just got harder so it's more difficult for me to progress my own stats to just keep up with the status quo.

I think it's perfectly acceptible to have all the new nightmare mobs in the later content (you know, where they were introduced and whatnot) but the older stuff that wasn't designed for it, it becomes really imbalanced.

Yes you can alter your stragegies to counter this but sometimes the new strats you need to counter new elite mobs require better stats which is already hard as shit to do, at least without being spoon fed shit by those @ the top.

This is a serious detractor to the enjoyment of the game for me. When i want new challenges i want to buy the new maps and move forward into new maps. As it stands i have no incentive to buy new content because the existing things just become even more and more impossible and the barrier to entry for the newer stuff becomes higher and higher.

It seems absolutely counter productive to me and only serves to drive people away I think.

1) There should be an intermediate difficulty between Insane and Nightmare.

2) The continuing addition of new monsters is problematic due to many reason: people can't keep up with strategies, older strategies become irrelevant, the difficulty increases too much, ect.

Here's one potential solution:
In NM, allow players to decide at the map selection screen which defense altering mobs spawn (spider/djinn/ and or sharken). Then increase the Loot drops/XP gain for each additional mob type on the map.

This would do at least three things to game playability:

1) It would allow there to be a nightmare mode without any of the crazy new mobs. This would be the intermediate difficulty many have asked for.

2) It would allow old strategies used prior to different shards DLC being released to still be used and perfected.

3) It would in effect create a gradient of end game difficulties, where the most supreme players can defeat maps with all the new mobs, while allowing newer end game players to concentrate on strategies for just one or two of the new mobs.

I would love to see that once a month (or something) a bunch of user created maps would be chosen, either from popularity or devs choice and then put into the ranked under a separate group (like the eternia shards pack) and can then be played on ranked. 

(and this as a response to someone)

... most people play ranked and so if you can't play these maps in ranked then most people won't play them. (or make them) If we get maps into the ranked then people might make more and people will also play them. And it also allows for us to have more variety in maps.

Bit of extra information: 

* Its egg attacks (ranged) don't do splash damage, or if it does the splash is pathetically small.

* Its melee attack is a headbutt that does ""splash"" and a bit higher amount of damage (7k damage per headbutt) but knocks enemies back, so the next attack on them is the pathetic single target egg attack.

* I only have 127 hero attack damage, but my animus can do 30k dps and that scales with hero attack too.

1. Squires have the most powerful towers. Mage towers may hit for more, but squire towers last longer, hit faster, and are AOE. Start by levelling a squire to around L50 or so, focusing exclusively on boosting tower power, HP, and rate of fire (in that order).

2. Set up a private trendynet match. Choose HALL OF COURT, HARD difficulty, and INFINITE BUILD TIME. 

3. [Position your towers like so.](http://i.imgur.com/E8kQd.png) On the first wave, put down the two S&amp;Ds facing the side halls and put a spike blockade and a bouncer blockade on the back ramps. On the second, place your harpoons. On the third, replace your rear blockades with slice and dices. 

4. After you finish setting up your towers, go to the forge and swap your hero to whatever low level you want to train. Hide between two of your frontal S&amp;D towers to avoid dark elves, but otherwise hide next to the crystal to avoid jihadists. Only use your squire to upgrade towers past level 2/3. 

5. Enjoy your 3-5 levels per round. Your player kills with your squire's towers count as your low level hero's kills. You'll gain all the experience that your squire would normally receive, and items will be level and class-adjusted.

1319860125.0,15,self.dungeondefenders,lsxiv,Dungeon Defenders has restored my faith in humanity.,Zephyrion,19,4,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/dungeondefenders/comments/lsxiv/dungeon_defenders_has_restored_my_faith_in/,"This is gonna be long, skip to the TL;DR if you don't feel like reading a long story.

Back in December of 2010, I was bored and looking for new steam games to play. They were having crazy sales, so I figured hey, why not look up random cool words? One of these words was Dungeon, and that brought me to Dungeon Defender's Steam page. After reading everything I could and watching every video, every screenshot I could find, I added it to my wishlist hoping it'd be released in early 2011 so I could play it with all my group of friends.

The next part of the story most of you are familiar with: The game gets finished but Microsoft and other various approval processes slow down the actual release date for months upon months. I start to lose patience, but then I remember that it's just a game and it'll come out eventually. I tweet a bit and post on DD's facebook page, and get actual answers from the developers. I'm impressed and my patience is restored. I play WoW, Rift, and TF2 to pass the time.

Finally a release date is announced after waiting far too long, and I'm still just as excited as I was when I first read about it. Dungeon Defenders is released on Steam on October 19th and of course I've prepurchased. I start to play on Online Open, and it works fine. The next day I've got problems connecting to a friend's game. =\. Well, of course, that day it gets patched and fixed. Awesome.

Play for a few more days, and everything's fine. Another patch comes through and now I can't edit my controls in the configure screen. Well, a friendly redditor by the name of [yuNoReadMyTextnArgue](http://www.reddit.com/user/yuNoReadMyTextnArgue) comes out of nowhere and tells me how to edit my controls by messing with the .ini. I do so and the game is again playable for me, and I am again happy. I've cleared the game 4 times in 4 days from start to finish, and I've got a squire and apprentice already at half the level cap.

Today, the TF2 patch for halloween came out (or maybe yesterday). And you know what I encounter? Assholes who could care less about the event, and just use the uber and crits to kill other players attempting to kill the eye for their achievements. People taking advantage of the distraction to set up sentries outside of the opposite team's spawn room. People airblasting others away from the necro-bombicon item that appears in the portal when Monoculus dies. In general, poor sportsmanship. I play more Dungeon Defenders and forget about TF2 for a while.

Things go well when I decide to start characters on Ranked just to earn steam achievements and participate there instead, as it's not any different from what I've been doing on Open. I join a game and it goes well enough, but my net drops and I slide out of the game. No big deal. I start a new game, this time in my own tavern, picking it up on the 2nd level where I dropped out. I solo it completely, and then go to Magus Quarters.

In Magus Quarters, a squire joins, and I have a damn great time with him. We talk quite a bit using the ingame chat, and I've made a new friend where I normally wouldn't have. I show him the first boss and don't skip any of the cutscenes I've already seen half a dozen times. He goes to bed, and I finish up Servant Quarters, and DD crashes shortly afterwards... no big deal, not even mad.

**TL;DR Trendy Ent is a damn great company, and while I encounter douchebag after douchebag on other games I love, I meet a nice person on Dungeon Defenders.**

Here's a video of how to do your turret placement. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ0leK7zH1s

Once you finish the challenge you get an Ogre Party Hat.  This weapon is usually worth approximately 1.3-1.4m.  The challenge takes about 3-4 minutes.  After doing this, go to your item box and upgrade the ogre party hat.  First upgrade is approximately 4k and the value of the weapon increases by 4k PLUS approximately 10-15% of the initial value of the weapon.  If you upgrade for 4k it makes the weapon worth about 204k more.  You can upgrade this weapon as many times as possible and it will ALMOST ALWAYS* (see below for few exceptions) be worth more than you invested to upgrade it.

I have done this many times.  I got one with an initial value of 1.5m.  I had 125m mana to start.  After upgrading it about 80 times I sold it for 140m.

1325983565.0,11,self.dungeondefenders,o7cj9,[TIP] Collection of UDKENGINE.INI tweaks that might substantially improve your DD performance,Wax_Paper,14,3,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/dungeondefenders/comments/o7cj9/tip_collection_of_udkengineini_tweaks_that_might/,"I wrote most of this up for a buddy the other day, and I figured I might as well share it with you guys as well. This is a collection of .ini tweaks that I've either read about or discovered myself since the game was launched, all which have the most potential to improve your performance and FPS. The first two settings alone boosted me from 30-ish FPS to 60 (with vsync on).

The Dungeon Defenders config file is called **UDKEngine.ini**. It can be found in the following folder (with the letter ""X"" representing the drive that DD is installed on):

X:\Steam\steamapps\common\dungeon defenders\UDKGame\Config\

First off, if you're already running the game on the ""High"" graphics quality setting (via the launcher setting), that's fine. These tweaks only change  specific aspects of the graphics rendering, while leaving the rest of the ""High"" graphics settings intact (which means you can still take advantage of cool things like postprocessing, bloom, etc.). These values just change a few custom settings that can make a big difference in performance, while still keeping the game looking good.

Open the .ini file in Notepad and search for the following settings. The easiest way to find them is to hit CTRL-F and type the setting's name (everything before the ""="" sign). Change each setting to the values listed below:

* DetailMode=0
* GraphicsQualityMode=0

These are two settings that can potentially have the most substantial effect on performance, from what I've found. Among other things like removing cel shading (cartoon outlines), these will change the monk auras to ""low quality"" mode without having to sacrifice a bunch of other stuff by turning the entire game to ""Low"" quality.

* DynamicShadows=False
* AmbientOcclusion=False
* UseHighQualityBloom=False
* SkeletalMeshLODBias=1
* ParticleLODBias=2
* MaxAnisotropy=1
* MaxMultisamples=1

Depending on your GPU, turning off dynamic shadows and ambient occlusion can have a pretty significant impact on performance. Turning off ""high quality bloom"" *might* help, and still leaves regular bloom on. The LOD values -- and especially anisotropy -- will probably have less of an impact.

If you try any of this, please post back here and let us know how it works for your system.

**EDIT:** I forgot to mention that your .ini file could be reset back to default every time there's a new update to the game installed via Steam (and sometimes it resets itself for seemingly no apparent reason). I change my .ini file to ""Read Only"" most of the time, which will force it to stay the same. You can either do this or just manually change the settings each time it gets reset. Note that if you do change the file to Read Only, you'll have to change it back whenever there's a new update, because there could always be new, intended changes to the .ini with each new patch.

**EDIT 2:** For the totally *opposite* side of the coin, here's a link to some .ini tweaks that you can use to improve the graphics quality beyond what DD offers the user by default:

http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2187084

**PS**: One last tip, related to game client stability (especially in windowed mode, or when alt-tabbing between the desktop and in-game)... I've found that **disabling Triple Buffering** -- if you're using it at all while running the game with Vsync enabled -- resolves a lot of the crashing issues that you might experience.

This makes it a little annoying when trying to sort through since you have several pages.

My suggestion is to make the item page sortable.

Sometime ago my friends and I bought Dungeon Defenders and we started playing together. It was so fun to play together that we decided to make some videos out of it, trying to convey how interesting it was for us and show the perspectives of each player.

Of course, we are somewhat newcomers to the game and so we're not as experienced as some people who know way more about builds, equipment, etc. But we're all enjoying and having a great time.

Try tweaking the .ini config file in this folder:

\Steam\steamapps\common\dungeon defenders\UDKGame\Config

...look for the **UDKEngine.ini** file.

Search for these entries and change them to the values below:

* DetailMode=0
* GraphicsQualityMode=0

You can leave the graphics option setting to whatever it was set beforehand... In fact if left on ""High Quality"" or whatever, only the tweaks that you change in the ini will take effect, which means you can still take advantage of cool things like postprocessing, bloom, etc. and just take away a few custom settings that will make a substantial difference in performance (while still keeping the game looking good).

**These are usually the two options that will have the biggest impact on performance**, but here are a few more values you can change as well...

* PoolSize=320
* DynamicShadows=False
* AmbientOcclusion=False 
* UseHighQualityBloom=False
* UseVsync=True
* SkeletalMeshLODBias=1
* ParticleLODBias=1
* MaxAnisotropy=1
* MaxMultisamples=1

...But out of everything, those first two values will make the most significant change in performance, but it still leaves the game looking great. It also tones down monk auras and some other special effects, but you won't even notice most of the changes.

The darkness traps remove immunities and the gas traps causes all the ogres to get stuck. You can dps them down with a huntress, or kill the creeps around them to deal with each pack of ogres 1 by 1, instead of 4 packs at the same time. 

It also means you can upgrade all your towers to max before wave 10.

Got to wave 17 before dd crashed. Previously I've never got past wave 10 before.

On later waves spiders wont die in 1 hit by the bouncer blockades so you will have to make sure that the harpoon turrets are partially facing eachother, so they can deal with spiders a bit on their own.

This build will take a lot longer than other builds, but if your stats are low it is very much worth it.

Hope it helps!

With the launch of this game on the PC platform, the game has transformed from a casual mobile phone game into almost an MMORPG, and with that comes the usual MMO problems like class balancing, gear inflation, casual vs. hardcore players. The only MMO I've played for a significant amount of time is WoW, so I'll be drawing my examples from it.


In the beginning, WoW endgame hadn't really been tested and classes weren't balanced for it so players discovered that certain classes could only fill niche roles and were useless otherwise. I think this is what we're seeing with Dungeon Defenders. In the beginning, Squire towers were the best, then some quick nerfs led to Apprentice towers being best, and now with tougher and tougher monsters, people are giving up towers for traps and DPS heroes instead. If someone currently wants to play a Tower Squire, there's no place for them outside of a few blockades. It took Blizzard 2 or 3 expansions, but now anyone can play any spec and have a place in raids.


We're seeing the number of upgrades on gear inflate way too fast. Just last month we were working towards stuff with 20-30 upgrades. Now we're seeing stuff with 141 upgrades: http://forums.trendyent.com/showthread.php?31870-7.12e-loot-o.O
Maybe they need to introduce daily map lockouts or something, but it's gotta slow down. For example, they could do something like the first time you complete 
""Heroic-mode"" Ramparts each day will reward a random super-loot item and a few bits of special currency.


That kind of system would allow casual players who might play an hour a day to complete a few maps and get a few super-loot items, whereas a hardcore player would clear the entire campaign/challenges every day. As it is now, I get home from work and I don't have 3-4 hours to sit down and do a survival map until the real good loot starts dropping, nor do I have the gear to even beat UberMonsterFest.

The system Blizzard set up with Random-Dungeon-Finder allows you to play for 30-40 minute chunks at a time, and slowly build up a special currency to buy gear at a shop. It wasn't as good as the hardcore raiding gear, but it still allowed casuals to experience their own progression. It also encouraged group-play since it automatically formed a group for you to complete a dungeon.

For the theme, think industrial era/Great War military technology. Possibly a little OP, but it's just a rough idea. Any feedback is welcome.

The Engineer is pretty exclusively a builder class. He can place towers normally, but for a couple more DU, he can also lay down tracks, much like the EV's beams. Towers built on tracks can be moved baack and fourth along the tracks, allowing defenses to be shifted to where they're needed most depending on the situation.

Towers:

Gatling Gun: A 'magic missle' sort of tower. The gatling gun does low damage at an extremely high rate of fire, allowing it to mow down masses of weak enemies with very little time wasted on overkill. 

Mortar: Extremely long range with splash damage, but unable to hit enemies who are too close. Best placed where they can cover major chokepoints that aren't right near the crystals.

Barbed Wire: Placed like a beam. Stops weaker enemies, and stronger enemies are slowed while taking damage. Another possibility is Sandbags, which would essentially be a Spike Blockade with more health that doesn't deal damage.

Flechette Turret: Hits a wide range for low damage at a moderate rate of fire. Used to provide cover over larger cover areas that would usually require multiple turrets.

Mustard Gas: Not too sure about this one. Imagine the Huntress's Gas Traps, only shorter lasting and fired from a turret, so it can be delivered further away and to where it's needed.

Abilities: 

These are super rough. I had trouble thinking of anything fitting my theme, so I'm not too happy with these.

Air Strike: Used when you need a bit of fast defense over a small area. Swaps into an overhead view where the Engineer can call down an explosion with a moderate splash. Not as much range as the Summoner's Overlord ability (ie the whole map), but more than you would get while summoning a tower.

Battlefield Maintainence: By expending extra mana, the Engineer can quickly repair all turrets in a small area near himself.

And that's all I've got. Super rough, but better than the Jester IMO. ",,False,self,t5_2sf8u,False,,,True,t3_y2lce,http://www.reddit.com/r/dungeondefenders/comments/y2lce/class_concept_the_engineer/,

Since I was close to the cap, I decided I would test something that chuckburban and I had discussed a while back.  After my test, it occurred to me that my buddy was correct.  Here is what I found:

Started with a Mythical Flintlock Huntress Weapon:

1859506813 mana

Cost to make a 200m token - 285368061

Cost to make a 400m token - 875276078

Cost to make a 600m token - 1608308569

So the 200 mana token costs roughly 30% more to make.  The 400m token costs roughly 54% more to make.  The 600m token costs roughly 63% more to make.

This weapon started off worth a little over 2mil with 228^s.  So since it costs me 1Bil mana more than the token is worth, I will stick with the 200m tokens going forward.  Sorry to all those who I trade with, but I can make about 7 200m tokens for the price of 1 600m token.

I would like to see some stats from other weapons.  I know there are many out there that cost less to make into tokens, so I wonder if their percentages would be that much different.  Would really like to find out which weapon is the best for making tokens, especially if it is over 200m and worth it to make :)",,False,self,t5_2sf8u,False,,squire-steam,True,t3_tht1w,http://www.reddit.com/r/dungeondefenders/comments/tht1w/making_400_and_600m_tokens_is_a_waste_of_mana/,

I don't really know if Trendy really read the suggestions subforums but I know pmasher read this subreddit, so I'll post my ideas here. And reddit has a better system to promote stuff. If what I say sucks, I will be downvoted.

So... currently Sky O' Love works like an escort mission... Escort mission sucks, but I think it fits the theme, so let's work around that.


----

Escort mission sucks: it sucks because most of the time, you have to escort a guy who walk slowly and does nothing but die. It's even more annoying when he dies from YOUR towers! Change the type of person to escort so it's not an enemy (like a countess in queen skin, and a squire), spawn them at different points of the map (north and south maybe), and make the enemies attack them. Don't spawn them in the middle of enemies right from the start...

----

How to escort: they will follow a predefined path and will walk slowly tower each other (maybe to reach the bridge in the middle of the 2 crystals), they will walk faster if you're near them. You can take a look at how the Payload Race works in TF2 for example. In the end, you'll have to protect them with towers and weapons.

----

Here is a layout.,Atmozfears,10,0,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/dungeondefenders/comments/p65n1/to_all_those_who_want_to_afk_solo_endless_spires/,"Here it is. http://html5.cubicleninja.com/dd/index.htm?layout=16196

First wave: http://html5.cubicleninja.com/dd/index.htm?layout=16197

This build doesn't require ANY upgrading or repairing. As you might know, this is one of the best maps for farming shop pets so here is a small explanation.

During first wave you go the top left creep, attack it with your genie until you have about 900 mana or so. Then during the wave build all the other towers. Let me show you where you can stand and make the map a lot easier.

http://html5.cubicleninja.com/dd/index.htm?layout=16198

Where the lightning tower is, there is a statue. Jump on your lightning tower and then on t he statue. That prevents you from getting hit AND spiders trying to kill you. You see, spiders are programmed to  only hit you but if they can't reach you they bug out. This will leave more time for your towers to attack the important targets. When confident that your towers can handle the spiders? Just go down from the statue. Easy as that.

My stats? **489/1271/449/925** This can be done with much worse stats. I don't know how low they can be but hopefully somebody here can test it.

Monk stats don't matter. I did it with a 200/200/200/200 monk, you just need to upgrade them ONCE.

I'm posting the steps so that Trendy can replicate this bug and patch it, assuming this is a bug.


Client Version: 7.05a  -  PC


Steps:

1) Open Dungeon Defenders

2) Select 'Play Online'

3) Select 'Ranked'

4) Click 'Click Here to Join'  (Change if you have already selected a character)

5) Click 'Edit Hero'

http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rilvenar/screenshot/630729409591151215

6) Click 'Change Outift' to cycle through the costumes.

http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rilvenar/screenshot/630729409591151674


-Once you have selected the outfit and colors you want to keep-


7) Hit the 'Enter' key on your keyboard, or 'A' on your gamepad.

Now your character has the skin/costume equipped.
Again, this is a bug report. I'm not trying to exploit the game.

Edit: I PMed JDanford about this and they are patching it as we speak. He told me to refrain from using the costumes for the time being, so I recommend we all do the same.

Yes i posted just some days ago, i know :)

Here is an overview of the stats, not exactly 100%:

Squire main builder: 1200-2300-1000-2200 (HP;DMG;RADIUS;ATS)
Auras 1,7k dmg, 1,4k range
EV 1,7k dmg, 1,5k hp, some ATS and range
Summoner 1700dmg, 1500 ats, 1500 range

What do you think, is it possible for us to farm KG or Aqua?
TBH i dont know how i could get my squire over 3k stats to farm KG without getting new gear out of KG?
Shops dont cut it anymore, i have on most key stats at least 350 points. I have a full set. How can i get improvements without drops or searching for hours in shops?
The maps that i can farm dont give the loot we need to progress :(

This is what I think, so far:

**Pros**

Great solo class

The MU points instead of DU makes him a welcome addition to a team, he won't soak up points that can go towards other defenses.

Beautiful animations for the summon glyphs and runes

Each minion has it's ups and downs and useability

Flies! (Hold down Jump)

**Cons**

Harder to get off the ground with a level 0 new player

Stats/gear is needed badly before even trying to solo some of the earlier stages

You feel really useless with no weapon and no dps pets

The overlord interface takes some getting used to.

Lots of buttons and clicks to get out your minions



**Overlord Mode (2)**
A neat spin on hero abilities, you go into an overhead view to control your minions while not taking any damage (You also cannot gain mana from any means). The scroll speed is a little slow, but this mode is very useful because you can summon, upgrade, and repair defenses across the map without being interrupted (I also think the casting speed is a little faster).

**Phase Shift (3)**
Similar to the Overlord Mode, without the control. You simply become phased and gain the ability to pass through creeps/defenses, but you can't gain mana or pick up items. A good ""OOPS"" button.

**Flash heal (0)**
At low ranks/few points, this is lackluster. It has a low cooldown, medium cost (150), and heals for a set percent. I'm curious how good it would be with more points placed into it.

**Minions**

*Archers* are awfully slow early on, but have great damage. Have them behind a blockade and they can pew pew safely. They have decent range as well. Later on, they become more useful and the rapid attack speed benefits greatly. The A.I for the hostile setting often makes them suicidal, however.

*Spiders* are pretty awful I think. They can slow and take away abilities from creeps, but the damage isn't high and I'd rather put the 80 mana towards another minion.

*Orcs* are wonderful in the middle stages, with a good cleave and high health, they can smack around most creeps with no issues. Having 2-3 in a group at a choke point is hilariously fun.

*Mages* are the cream of the crop. High damage, good range, good speed, and they can *heal* players and minions (NOT TOWERS). Well worth the 180 mana and subsequent upgrades, you will most likely build a LOT of these bad boys.

*Warriors* are nearly exactly like the enemy, but they only leap/circle slice when they are on the hostile-seeking A.I. function, which can often send them to their demise, wasting 300 mana. Putting them in a choke point can make them circle slice, however.

*Ogres* are everything you'd want and more in an ogre summon. Tough, slow, cleave, ugly, and costly (600 mana, unlocks at level 30), this monstrosity will be plentiful in your stages and will bring a pounding worth the mana.


Overall, I love this class. It's a rocky start without any gear or good pets, but once you get a few levels, it ramps up to some fun times.",,False,self,t5_2sf8u,False,,apprentice-steam,True,t3_ugw1e,http://www.reddit.com/r/dungeondefenders/comments/ugw1e/first_impressions_summoner/,

The traditional ""best weapons"" for the Huntress in the popular view, as I understand it:

Retribution: Classical ""shotgun blast"" weapon. No pierce, high frontal damage.

Bone Bow: Classical ""rail gun"" weapon. Single line of fire, very high damage rate, pierces 4.

Disk Thrower: A slower bone bow that fires along two lines. 

--------------------------

I'd like to argue, though, that there are a few other weapons - some admittedly harder to acquire - that would make great main, constant-use weapons. Wondering what other people think on this:

#1 - **Attenuator** model. Aka Lava Beetle Exterminator, aka Soul Focuser - Demon Lord drop. Note that this is NOT the common drop Soul Shooter thingus that looks like a big ""X"" with strings.

The problem here is that you're only going to get a high quality one if you're very, very lucky - only drops on Misty and Moraggo, or from the shop. If you do, though - max fire rate of 8, standard damage upgrade curve, and it shoots through infinite numbers of small enemies and WALLS. Walls, folks - obstructions aren't. Given its longer-than-average range, can we not see the potential for power here? Strangely, though - perhaps because it's harder to get, or perhaps because no one appreciates it - I've never heard about it.

#2 **Chicken Gun model** - Also known as Coop Protector, Crazy Farm, and a few others. Easily recognizable from the chicken staring out the front of the overlarge barrel.

Now hear me out. Grenade launchers, in theory, can be great weapons. Terrible for fliers, to be sure, (your piercing shot says ""hi!"") but on maps where bowlers work, this gun can also work. Standard damage curve (which is unusual for AOE weapons), AOE damage, and the ability to bounce and drop down to places that might be awkward to shoot otherwise. What makes the Chicken gun truly significant, though, is this: unlike every other grenade launcher, *its damage is not fire-based.* No fire immunity protection from the dread cluck. Get the RoF up on this, and you've got one series henhouse clearance tool.

#3 **Shaitan of the Thousand Winds** - the demon-faced flamethrower.

Much like the reason the Chicken Gun is potent - it's a flamethrower with a neutral damage base. Flamethrowers are either flame or poison based as their chief damage type (never seen an electric one) and this limits their otherwise considerable effectiveness. With a ROF 15, nothing slips past a Shaitan or any other flamethrower - they're going to take the damage. Since all flamethrowers are triple-stream, the damage output they can unleash is pretty shocking. Their limitation, obviously, is both the element issue (which the Shaitan avoids) and their range. If you were to stand behind an inverted barricade, though, I'd argue that these things make one heck of a case for an ogre-flambe tool.

I have only tested these with level 70s so I'm not sure if you can do it at lower levels. 

You will need:

Tower Monk

Tower Apprentice

Some DPS class(I used Huntress and you might not even need a DPS depending on your tower stats)

Here are screens of my own stats(Mediocre Gear)

[Huntress+Blasticus](http://cloud.steampowered.com/ugc/596953305034864783/F0F07599B0B589375F873C84E75B191FC8619F94/)

[Monk](http://cloud.steampowered.com/ugc/596953305034858526/85F114A4618E4BD59B2626DCC7E87E59941C47CF/)

[Apprentice](http://cloud.steampowered.com/ugc/596953305034866217/AA7E227D4607EC65B4A49266F3CF0367BAFCB613/)

This setup is not perfect but works wonders if you dont have amazing gear and is almost AFKable.

**FIRST WAVE**

Start off as your apprentice and grab all the mana. Try to cover each chokepoint with at least one tower(excluding the air paths if you have a DPS character). It should look something like [this.](http://cloud.steampowered.com/ugc/596953305034859957/9226B7AFB428AA3A4B40CA8FCEDD43BE588D81F4/) Change to your DPS class if you have one. You will want to fend off any loose ends, it should be fairly easy.

**SECOND WAVE**

During the second wave switch back to Apprentice if you changed to DPS earlier and then begin adding more turrets where they are needed. If you do not want to read the tower placements please refer to image at bottom(Final Setup).



*Northern Crystal;*
 At the north crystal I have 2 MM and 2 FB towers facing west; 1 MM facing the crystal for wyverns; 2 MM and 2 FB facing the northern spawn. 

*Southern Crystal;*At the south crystal place 2 FB towers facing the pumpkin spawn/itembox that is north of the crystal. Place an additional 2 FB towers facing the west roof(place them on the wall next to the stairs). 2 MM towers on the stairs also facing west towards the roof.
Place 3 MM towers on each Air path and then put 1 FB tower on either of them(not both).

*Middle Crystal;* Have 2 MM and 2 FB towers facing west towards the pumpkin spawner. Place 1 MM behind the crystal to protect from wyverns. At the southmost bridge place 2 MM and 2 FB towers at the end of it.

After placing these switch to monk and place Slow+Electric auras at each chokepoint.

[Final Setup](http://cloud.steampowered.com/ugc/596953305034856380/6396EAFFE482FF1F09E1346C3D1A53CA2DD0079F/)

**THIRD WAVE AND ONWARD**

From here you should be able to relax a little and pick off stragglers. Make sure to upgrade and repair in between rounds, you shouldnt have to worry about it during the round. Your crystals WILL get damaged but never will it be in danger of being destroyed if done properly! I find that the most difficult wave is actually the skelaton wave because they put my turrets in the most danger, I would recommend patrolling and killing any skelatons you can. During the waves an orc or two will wander towards the north crystal and while the wyvern turret WILL kill them, it is safest to dispose of them yourself. Because of this I usually stay on the north crystal and wait [there.](http://cloud.steampowered.com/ugc/596953305034860967/48C8F127A939601231552D285684147F2B1AEE31/) 

**DISCLAIMER?**

As I said at the start, this is not a perfect setup but it does work efficiently if done properly. If you have a preferred style by all means modify this so it is best for you! This is also my first guide so let me know if there is anything wrong and stuff I can improve!

There are a couple issues with this;

1. You need alot of mana to buy good gear, and farming insane will take FOREVER to gather enough mana.

2. Now that Nightmare pretty much has all the new mobs (Djinns, Sharkens and Goblin Copters) in addition to the ogres and spiders, only the people who started nightmare during shards pt.1 actually had a chance to play it with Godly gear and actually ADVANCE properly in the game.

I think the games current state is really annoying for people who haven't played the game as long as others. Is there a way to advance to nightmare properly without getting boosts / buying really good gear cuz I've tried multiple times with friends and we just struggle alot, We've bought alot of gear and even good gear but still struggle to even go thru the regular campaign on Nightmare.

I completed ES NM HC and I found a Laser Robot in my shop. Since I play on Open, because the mana grind was something I didn't like when I played back on the xbox, I bought it and upgraded it to level 50, and it has 97 upgrade levels.

It's damage is just over 3000, 6 shots a second, 2 upgrades, and 5345 Projectile speed.

It's damage in tavern was 6.8k per shot. I loaded up ES again and it was doing ~~14.2~~K PER SHOT. I can post some pictures later for verification.

**EDIT 2**: I fully upgraded the robot.  All upgrades were in damage except for 2 into Shots Per second, 1 into # of Projectiles, and 2 into Projectile speed. The damage on NM was 29k.  Pictures  at the bottom.

I loaded up No Towers Allowed on NM to see how far I could get solo.

More info related stuff/questions,Kachi6391,10,2,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/dungeondefenders/comments/odioz/what_would_a_tiger_pet_be_good_for_everyone/,"This is the [Tiger](http://i.imgur.com/D9RvY.jpg) in question. 

He's still locked in my shop. I just don't know if anyone actually wants him because from what I've seen. There are much better alternatives with much lower stats (Guards).

Shoot, I might pick him up JUST for the stat boost before I find a good Guard... 

Also, what are some good examples of when to use a certain pet, or when to switch out a pet on a character? ...

I'm having trouble NOT using my Genie after the first 2-3 waves. I feel he's just too good, but having a App guard would, in my mind, greatly out weight even having a Tower at 3 Stars. But I just can't pry my hands off the Genie knowing it'll only hit a few towers when I could just Upgrade ALL my tower quicker with a Genie.

I love this game. For some reason I love the grind. Everything I've done, I've done solo with the exception of some help from a very, very generous Redditor that got me on my feet.

I feel the one thing lacking with this game is the lack of info around.. That's a bold statement to make, yes, but I feel like if I went to the forums, stuff is so spread out and buried, it would take hours (maybe) to find what I'm looking for. 

[The Wiki](http://dungeondefenders.wikia.com/wiki/Dungeon_Defenders_Wiki) is GREAT, don't get me wrong. I've used it so much since I've started. And I know it's community run, please don't take this as bashing it, I'm not, I love it. But so much stuff on there is out of date. Maybe it's because patches change things so dramatically? I haven't been around long enough to know or understand that. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is: There needs to be something to help out people like me. Not a, ""Oh, here is everything on a platter, now you know everything."" But an easier way to find what, again, people like me are looking for. 

As another example, I just learned of the 200m Mana soft cap. I read that if you don't have a way of making a crap ton of money all the time, SPEND THAT, MAN! So, I did. On stuff that makes sense, of course. Tower stats, things like that. I Up'd the logical things, I think, but someone else might not be so clear on what to upgrade on some great gear they may have found/bought from a AFK shop. If they don't make money often, or they don't farm and are not hard core players (if that's the right thing to say) and they upgrade the wrong thing. They can't go back (from what I know). They can't change what they did to their gear.

I'm sorry this is so long winded... I didn't mean any of this to sound disrespectful or rude. I love the community. I love the game. I feel bad because I always come to Reddit and ask questions about what seem like obvious things. I feel like I spam the board with such simple questions that it makes people gain a dislike for people like me. 

TL;DR - What the hell can I do with that [Tiger](http://i.imgur.com/D9RvY.jpg) and I wish there was an easier way for new player (like me) to find info on things about the game that are not quite obvious.

So, I was looking at a LONG haul to get a fully upgraded weapon/armor/pet set for ONE character, but it seemed doable. Now I'm looking at the new Nightmare items and thinking that EACH item will require the amount of mana I was looking at using for a full set on a character.

Am I missing something? I quit WoW because I got tired of the timeplayed=power with actual skill being largely tertiary to the character power equation. Am I running into the same thing here? If so I guess I'll cut my losses and find my entertainment elsewhere.

Last thought. I'm ok with SOME amount of timeplayed=power, it seems to be an assumed part of multi-player gaming nowadays, they even put it in the FPSs. However, there is a point at which it creats a chasm between the players that treat the game like an 80 hour-a-week job and those that are just looking for a diversion.

50-60 hours to get your character at least near high-end power? Its a lot of time but even a casual with moderate playtime per week could probably do that in 2-3 months. 500+ hours to get your character at least near high-end power?

Thanks for your help/advice!**

So, yeah, what the title says... There's no way to get that progress back, I assume, but I need to know how to make this not happen again. 

This was on local single player. After beating a level I exited to the main menu because I decided I wanted to go play online. When I went to play online I made a character with the same name as my local character, but a different class. After playing a while online I went back to local to find that either it hadn't saved, or it had reverted to an earlier save.

So, a few questions:

1. Do you have to quit to the tavern before quitting to the main menu for it to save?

2. Did making a character online with the same name as my local character screw something up?

3. Is there any small chance that maybe I can boost myself back to where I just was? I mean, an hour and a half isn't much but I accomplished a lot.

4. How do I stop this happening again? Because there is *no save button*, which actually miffs me a bit because I was paranoid enough about it already before this happened.

Thanks in advance.

I am rolling with a level 25 squire. I just beat the level with the goblin mech boss. I really enjoy strategizing my defenses. I use mainly walls and harpoons. I put most of my points in defense. The most in attack damage and defense health. Every couple levels I throw a point in area of effect and defense attack speed. Once in a while I put points in move speed and my health to try and not get too far behind. And I focus my gear on defense related stats. On to my questions.


1. Am I wasting points by putting them anywhere other than defense stats? Are there specific defense points for the squire that are significantly more valuable than others? When I level up my equipment should I only put points into my defense stats or should I also buff up weapon damage, general reisistance etc..

2. Can anyone help me with an ELI5 version of the different challenge modes. How should I progress through them. Should I jump to hard first, or medium survival. Does mob health only increase by the difficulty settings? Do I get the same level of gear from medium regular mode and medium survival mode? 

3. What are the most efficient uses for my mana? Level all my equipment? Purchase items from the tavern? Should I just farm and save for things or drop all my mana back into my gear?

4. Is there any DLC that I really should not pass on the opportunity to buy? If there was 1 or 2 DLC that I should really have. Recommendations?

5. And finally any basic super noob tips that might really help me in the long run would be greatly appreciated.

6. Edit for another question: For the squire, any tips for using the slice and dice and bumper defenses. I almost never use them and I think I am missing out on some optimization. Thanks!

This may have been said a bunch of times, if so I apologise but I have searched on the suggestions thread and did not see anything.

&gt;I have been playing nightmare stuff more and more recently and I have found that me and a friend can do things with 2 people fine but add a single person more and it will become a lot more difficult or in the case of survival, take a lot more time. For example we were trying umf and we managed to do it fine with 2 people, but when there was 3 or more then we would simply run out of time.

&gt;I think that this is a problem as it causes people to play solo or with just one person and (I find at least) that the game is more enjoyable with more people, something should be done especially since trendy are making maps that can support up to six people now, I feel that the difficulty ramp should be changed. I'd like to make it clear that I don't want the difficulty ramp to be put so low that there is barely any change but that it makes it so a person can actually make up for this increase in difficulty instead of making it extremely difficult or just not able to be done.

A little backstory: I logged on hoping to get a level or two of the main campaign done on NMHC, for cheevos and whatnot. And since I'm not capable of building nightmare mode quality defenses, I usually aim to jump onto the coattails of someone who is, normally through the main menu by just looking through a filtered list of nightmare games.

So I was looking through the menu and the only game that wasn't in a tavern, set up as a shop, or doing monsterfest was in the magus quarters. I joined immediately.

Upon getting in, the owner asked me if I had a guardian pet, and then [this happened](http://i.imgur.com/bsI9u.jpg). The image is cropped slightly to hide the name of one of my friends, whose game I'd been in just before this. My character is level 76.

A description of what was going on during the chat log in the picture:
He asked me if I had a pet, I said yes, realized it was survival (which was not what I was looking for) but decided to stay and help them get everything to 3stars, since I had a genie. Before I asked him if he was ready, I went around and opened chests and gathered mana from the last round so I could use it to upgrade a thing or two, which I did. (Edit: I said ""G when you are [ready]"" to let him know that I wouldn't press G until he did, and that he didn't have to tell me he was ready, all he had to do was press G to let me know.) Then the last part of the chat log happened, after which he immediately kicked me.

What the fuck?

It's like every time I join the game of someone who is nightmare-ready, they're either a complete asshole or qualified to be a top ranked military drill sergeant, threatening to kick people left and right for a single misstep and then doing it anyway.

I don't understand; is being a complete dick to everyone a requirement for being nightmare-ready? Or am I just incapable of finding nice people?",,False,self,t5_2sf8u,False,,huntress-steam,True,t3_rjz9q,http://www.reddit.com/r/dungeondefenders/comments/rjz9q/this_just_happened_to_me/,

I don't want to exclude anyone, but do try to think about whether this is going to be too difficult for your character build. We won't need any tower builds as I do all of that, so just dps.

I bought Dungeon Defenders for my PC a few weeks ago and played it for a while now. The archievement you have to get for the steam holiday sale might be quite difficult for new players that just started today and try it alone, so if you need any help, just leave a comment and maybe we can play together.

Fair warning though: I'm from Germany, so lag and/or different timeszones might be an issue if you are from ~~america~~ too far away ;)

But hey, I just wanted to offer my help. Happy gaming!

---

**WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO TO GET THE ARCHIEVEMENT**

You have to complete the holiday map ""Etherian Holiday Extravaganza"". You can download it for free on steam.
On this map you have to pick up presents (always at the same place) and deliver them to christmas trees on the map. It's always a different tree and you have to deliver a couple of presents to a tree (more presents if you play with more players)
You have to deliver the presents to more than one tree later one (last wave = 4 trees). You have only a few defense units, that means, you can build only very few towers/traps/etc.
You can only pick up a present when nobody else has a present in his hands. It takes 10 seconds to lay down a present on a tree. If you get hit while carrying a present, you will loose the present (usually it takes 2-3 hits)

---
**EDIT**
I'm awake and ready guys! My steam ID is ""di_L3r"". Just add me or write me a pm, etc. I already did the archievement with a friend of mine on easy and it was...well...easy.

**EDIT2**
It is possible to get the archievement in non ranked matches. And since you can cheat there, you could make your life a lot easier. But even with overpowered items and chars, the level is still difficult because you will get slowed down when you pick up a present and you will loose it at fast as anybody else.

With that said, I never cheated and never played ranked mode :P

**EDIT3**
Ok I helped a few people. I still have some time, so just add me on steam. Added an explanation of the map. It's 6:20pm here.

[This is how i do it](http://html5.cubicleninja.com/dd/index.htm?layout=1735)

About my setup:
I got a wallsquire, so the two blockades are extremely tough. But they hardly really need to be. My towermage is well specced, so i use alot of his towers. This setup get's me up to wave 20. From then you need to dps quite a bit it keep up. But i guess 25 is doable.

If your auras are not great, skip the electric, only use the slow aura. And take some more towers.

The lightning tower needs to be placed kobolt safe. So maybe a bit more to the back if it get's hit. Or it'll be destroyed later in the game when there's rushes of kobolt players

Last note about Alch labs: Solo it! Really, solo it. The mobs get more health when you use more then one player. So kobolts are no longer one hit kills. I really like to solo it or play it with max 1 other player. Running around with 4 people is fun, but IMHO less effective.

I would like to propose a simple solution to our problem, when loading into an insane map all characters should be frozen in place until everyone has hit G to start the building phase and countdown timer, this will give us enough time to get everyone loaded and ready for the limited build time have.

Pvp is crazy, its one shot kill for any decent player. I havent upgraded my gear to cater for pvp yet but with people doing atleast 20-30k dps(I'm doing 80k but anything above 10k will kill people) everyone dies in a second, regardless of block, resists and health. 


If the resists were higher it might be a bit better, or they some how scaled the damage or health like in assault it might be interesting. Even if I am using enrage i can barely catch up to the huntress run speed. 


Squire towers arent great either, if a mage can get a decent set up done quick its relatively formidable but squire towers are pretty useless. Their projectiles arent near fast enough to hit anything and the bouncers rarely get kills, you can just jump over them, unlike the huntress traps which will kill you even jumping over them, the monk auras are huge also, an electric aura will kill you in a matter of seconds. 


Im predicting once the 10th rolls around, its going to be a huge huntress fest. 


Only way squires and monks can really survive is by blocking. It is far too hard to get close to Huntresses and mages. I have 99% on my large dps weapon and 104% on another, so i dont die very fast at all when blocking but it only blocks the front. Against 2 players you are royally screwed.

I know the point of Survival Mode is to last as long as you possibly can, and I do love this concept. But it also comes with its own set of problems. Let me explain :

Last night I started a Survival map on Magus Quarters, on Normal difficulty. I just wanted to try it out. I ended up dying on the 13th wave due to an army of super wyverns.

Anyways, the issue I had is that there were way too many monsters. 3000, 4000, 5000, 6000 per wave. And let me remind you I was playing ALONE. If it scales just like any other map with more players, I can't even imagine the amount of enemies to kill.

Due to this high number of foes... finishing a wave takes up more than 30 minutes. What happens if I need to leave after investing 3 hours in this map ? ""Luckily"" enough, I lost just when I wanted to go to bed, but had I won the last wave, I would have had to just quit the game.

Now I know you can choose the starting wave when you launch a survival map, but I just think it's too bad that if you're ""too good"", you'll have to abandon your game. If we could just save it (and being able to load it only once) so that you could resume the survival you started last night, that would be a great feature for those you can't play many hours at a time!

also the weapon dmg and over all stats seem amazingly low so i dont know what the max is and if i might go over and undershoot my stats(not sure if they patched this problem on consoles).
also there is no community shops so trying to find a full set of matching stats armor is proving damn near impossible.
if anyone who knows the specs on both systems could educate me a bit or even give some tips i would be eternally grateful. thanks.

* You can post multiple times of course. 

* You can not guess more than one map/enemy in one submission. To clarify: *Either* guess a map per submission *or* guess an enemy. One at a time.

* Do not touch the water while rescuing Terry.

* One person can win both times the pack if they're lucky enough.

I also have a good DPS boost monk to switch to. I'm at the stage where I can solo NMHC survival on aquanos to completion (and have discovered the drops aren't as good as I thought). 

I think for the harder maps though, you really need teamwork. Mostly I think, you need micromanagement of individual choke points, in terms of quick upgrading, repairing proximity traps if you use them, helping to melt ogres, and especially using tower boost during rounds. E.g. on Talay mining you definitely need at least one person for each of the four crystals.

I'm hoping there are people on here at a similar (or more advanced) stage who'd be interested in working together.

So, i was bored and put some towers in my Tavern and noticed some things, i cannot explain.

The first Tower (Harpoone) was at a Attack Rate of 0.5sec. So it should attack 2 twice a second, but the the DPS on the dummy was only 1.5 times the Attack Damage.

Afterwards, i used a Buff Beam on the same Turret, and the Attack Rate went down to 0.3 sec, but the DPS only went up to 2.5 times the Attack Damage. (Should be more than 3 times it...)

So, i searched in google and found out, that there is a cap for Attack Rate on a tower, allthough i did not find any values for the harpoone. The wiki seems to not have them (atleast i did not find any info on that matter in it).

But the second point is, that allthough there might be a cap for Attack Rate, that does not explain, why the damage in is lower in both cases than it should be. Anyone has an explanation for it?

Thanks in advance.

This is something that warms my heart and makes me smile!  We all love making new friends, and teaching them how to play.

That's not what this post is about though.  This is about the rising costs of unworthy items in player shops, and the negative effect it is having on the economy.

I realize that we'd all like to have the best gear for the cheapest possible price, AND, we'd all like to make a boat load of money from our player shops.  

Alas, it is impossible.  This is one case where we can't have our cake and eat it too.

At some point, the 5000% markups have to stop.

If cheap MYTH sells for 3-5m, good MYTH sells for 5-15m, and super MYTH sells for 20-35m a piece, then we still have room to upgrade our prices for the higher end gear.

As it stands though, TOO MANY people are pricing worthless gear in the upper hundreds of millions. 

Now, if you sell your cheap myths for 50m, your good for 100-200m, and your really good myths for 200m+, then... 

Cheap Trans is going to cost at least 100m a piece.  That means ok Trans are going to come it at 300-500m, and good ones are going to run 500-750m.  

Where does that leave us for Super and Ultimate?

Do you really expect me to charge 25 billion for a crappy bit of Ultimate just to float this over-bloated economy?

Now that shards 4 is out, we need to consider the long term effects.

Is a bit of Super really worth 1 billion when it only upgrades your stats by 10-15 points?

**We, as a community, need to bring these myths down in price.**

  I do realize that it'll lower the prices of the lower quality items.  No more being able to charge 1m+ for a bit of Godly or lower quality armor.  Secret Tip - People in lower levels don't have money anyways.

Help me help you.
Help us help the economy.

Only we can curb the ridiculous prices.

After all, do you really think my 1100/1000/700/700 tower myth set is worth 1 billion+  ?

Some frame of reference. My highest character is a 72 adept. I have a 70 barbarian, 70 monk, 63 countess and 56 EV. I've yet to beat a NM level.

1. Do Accessories drop in Nightmare only or just more ""often"". I've played dozens of.Medium Glitters lately to level up as well as finally completing a 25 waves of HC Insane Deeper well and have seen nothing yet. I understand they are rare but I've seen multiple people claim this rareness being ""one drop per game"".

2. Speaking of Glitter, is there a better map to level up on? I'm playing with 3 characters on my computer (2 extra Xbox Controllers) and it seems to go pretty fast for my lower characters. I've only done HC medium difficulty so far (tried HC hard once and lost to the last wave)

3. I've got my characters all specced for tower building. 

My adept is spread out over damage, attack speed, and area of effect. I use her towers for mainly damage.

My countess has health and damage maxed. The spiked blockade is all I use her for ATM

EV is damage and attack speed focused. I mainly use it for the Buff Beam on my Adepts towers but occasionally her proton beams as well.

My Monk is specced for aura lifespan and damage/effect. I only use his ensnare aura in my defenses.

So finally the question. Is there any way I can better spec these characters for the roles I've given them? Or should I change what towers I use them for?

4. Any advice for Pure Strategy runs? I found the only way i could beat deeper well on Insane was to leave some blockades at rank 3/4 then upgrade mid battle. Is this a common tactic or a sign that I should rethink my defenses/try again at a higher level?

5. If you switch out characters, the only stat on towers that decreases is damage, correct? So attack speed/AoE/Health remain unphased?

I got a couple questions though thus far though. I've been playing on ""open"" recently with a friend, and was amazed at all the towers, how fast they were, how quick people we're downing things, etc. (I've since learned that these were majorly modded or hacked and it kinda bummed me out). I got an app and a monk both to 78 and both with pretty good but not fully upgraded mythical gear. My monk is DPS oriented while my app is tower oriented. I enjoy the idea of ""soloing"" this game by swapping well-geared heroes out myself and getting through levels on my own with a strong tower character or two, and a really good DPS character.   

I tried the nightmare on TDW with a couple snare towers from my monk and a solid set up from my apprentice, and couldn't even pass the second level. I also can't pass level ~11 or 12 on TDW Hard Survival Mix. So my question really is: What do I need to play/do to get the most out of this game? I want to 100% the shit out of it, even if that means grinding multiple classes to 78 and gearing them out. Do you guys reccomend a class combo for ""solo"" gameplay like I have in mind? I'm going to roll brand new on ranked instead of open to avoid all the mods and cheats and level my new guys in a more legit way. As the wiki seems a little out of date, I also wanted to ask if transcendent gear was actually feasible - and where you even obtain it?

After we beat Endless Spires and got to the boss wave (not the boss) in Summit, I went a bit crazy dumping mana into my gear to upgrade it with a bunch more tower attack speed and damage.
 
My friend is getting pretty excited about trying Nightmare in ""Hardcore"" mode. The thing is, he and I tend to die a lot in Nightmare (which is fine and makes it challenging), but if we want to do Hardcore Nightmare for better loot, I'm thinking some resists might be in order.
 
I don't want to waste upgrades in stuff I don't need, so based on what damage types I *think* mobs do, I'm thinking of starting off upping my Physical and Poison resists first and foremost.
 
Goblins: Physical

Dark Elf Rangers: Physical

Orcs: Physical

Kobolds: Fire(?)

Ogres: Physical &amp; Poison(?)

Summoners: Fire

Skeletons: Physical

Dark Elf Warriors: Physical and lots of it (I hate these guys)

Wyverns: Fire

Spiders: Physical(?)

The bosses seem to do Physical and Fire.
 
Is this list accurate? Does anything *actually* do Electrical?
 
Are my priorities (Physical and Poison) correct? I mean, I'll eventually have to upgrade Fire Resist for bosses, but I think I can hold off on that for a bit.
 
I'm thinking that if I can improve my survival against spiders, the occasional Dark Elf Warrior and most importantly against Ogre snotballs (which usually hit me while I'm repairing or upgrading my towers), I think we'll have a much easier time with most maps.

For squires, so far it seems like almost anything goes since they tweaked slower weps to deal more damage. Is there any one weapon type (e.g. katanas, gladius', demon swords, etc.) that has been found to be optimal? And what about the knockback stat?

For huntresses, this seems to be a bit less obvious. It seems like high end chain guns have a huge potential single-target DPS output, but lack the ability to pierce like a skull bow would. I also see disc throwers seem to be hugely popular.

Could someone give me a rundown on my options? I've been crawling my way through nightmare progression on my apprentice and want to start working on my DPS huntress and countess, so I'm looking to invest in a nice weapon. I don't want to dump hundreds of millions into upgrading a wep with 150 upgrades if I'm just going to graduate to a 200+ weapon eventually.

One challenge I really want to tackle is the 4 Warping Core DLC challenges. I'd like to get a set of Zamira armor and see the stats on a NM run. I'd also like to get the fairy for completing all 4.

I found a good partner to duo with last night.. we tried #1 and #2 about 3-4 times each. He was doing the building because he had good app towers and monk stats. Survivability wasn't a problem. The problem is that the cores warp very close to the spawns. It takes a little bit of luck and a maybe a better build than we were using.

One trick we found out... we each used genies, which gave us plenty of mana in the first wave. If you can leave one spider attacking a tower or chasing the dps player (me) in circles, the other guy can complete the full build during the first wave. This helped a lot. 

We made it to the final wave on #1 twice and just didn't make it. Anyone have success with this yet? Have any ideas/suggestions?

Anyone want to try this later? I normally solo/duo b/c lower mob count, but I think 4 players may be ideal for this for coverage when cores warp. If a player is already near the spawn that the core warps to, it shouldn't be as much of an issue. Trying to pull up the mini map, avoid spiders, find new core (covered by mobs) can be difficult.

Therefore, I figured I'd make a new thread. 

Sorry for not answering most of you, but I don't go a minute without getting a message from someone on steam. 

My party is at 8PM Eastern (THURSDAY) standard time zone (New Jersey/New York time). No, I won't figure out what time this is for you in your respective time zone. After farming all these items I think some of you can at least convert the time on your own. 

I was hoping to have all the items be at least 120+ ups, but because of the new update UMF nightmare is impossible. You no longer respawn, and on the higher waves the assassins move faster than you do. Even with my gear (Which I've not found a single person who has better gear than myself), I'm completely outmatched. 

As a result, a lot of the stuff is wave 9-10 stuff instead of wave 13 stuff.  There's still a good amount of really nice items, but it isn't of the quality I was hoping. I currently have about 150 items, hopefully that's enough (Though I'll try to get some more). 

And as I said before, I'm really disappointed at the guy from the subreddit who came into my tavern through my steamid and jacked a ton of the items that I had on the ground. I forgot that people on your steam friend's list can join your private party. 

I'm hoping this will be somewhat self moderated. I have a really hectic week with finals and for the most part expect to be afk during a lot of the giveaway.  

Please come in, pick an item, and then leave the shop so the next person can get a space. It'll be private so random people won't be able to find my shop, only people on my friend's list. Please be patient if you can't get in, I'm expecting a pretty crazy influx. 

Cheers er'body,
Tom

P.S thank Dday as well, helped me get most of the items.  If anyone has anything to donate, feel free to bring it to the party. I'm sure a lot of people here still even need godly gear :)

P.P.S- Couple item pics. AS you can see, the quality varies.

Issues with this game are a big part of it becoming dull as well as a lot of playing over and over again obviously.

 Now I'm not trying to go on a rant or anything but I think if I can bring some of this to light more it will help the game and the community; even if just a tiny bit it will be worth it to me.

**The Biggest Issue: Balancing**


**UMF:**
Now I know this has been said over and over again and the developers have an uphill battle against this sort of thing. UMF is a disaster and will continue to be since it is supposed to be for the best of the best, an end of the line sort of challenge that saps the fun out of it all when you get all this amazing gear too quickly. I had fun earning my gear when my characters were weaklings and seeing them improve but when you get to 70 and you meet some of these veteran players that constantly farm UMF your character couldn't hold a candle to them in any way, shape, or form. Obviously veterans are going to have better gear but this is a little insane to be nowhere close to their level and worse yet you need to rely on them to get anywhere or be forced to grind your hands off to be able to afford anything decent by their standards.


**TL;DR:** UMF has done more harm than good because the gear and the divide is just too distant from people that play the other maps and challenges. You need the strong geared people to get you set up or prepare your hands to be in casts after grinding for ages to get decent gear to UMF hoarder standards.


**Classes**
I don't believe I need to explain myself here since this is a fairly common thing to hear that there needs to be more balancing. Squire for example: ""why you useless for anything except Group Hug since my level 70 Countess doesn't count?""


**The Next Biggest Issue: The Players:**
I recently joined a pubic survival map on insane where the round had just ended and there was this fellow soloing it all. Now being any normal person I saw a green item and I picked it up and equipped it and then the host saw me and came unglued. He asked me ""who I was ""(Note: He was swearing and using much cruder language than what I'm going to put here in this post as him saying) and ""what I was doing taking items."" I replied to him saying I thought it was acceptable to equip dropped items that were green for your character. Then I was booted within seconds without any further comment. I tried to come up with a logical explanation for why he chose to do this since he could not have used that item on his character he was playing as. I came to the conclusion he was most likely soloing and he hosted a public game. Then I thought about how other people and myself have been treated in other games since people are too narrow-minded or they're focusing too much on trying to grind for that decent gear possibly. I've come across plenty of people like this that boot without disregard that make the community and the game a tiny bit more unappealing. 


**TL;DR:** Can we please be a little more friendly on publicly hosted games instead of automatically booting? This will make the game and the community look better if you put more thought in for others.


The more I think back about things like this the more I am thankful I had friends to play with early on or I doubt I could have lasted as long as I have now with the game. So please Trendy, take to heart what I have laid out here and what others have said before you overextend and start to chip away at your fan base.

My suggestions for the balancing is really do more testing and absorb as much input as possible like any other game. Though this is much easier said than done but in the long run it will be worth it if you take your lumps now.

You really can't change people but you can make the atmosphere a little more friendly, possibly adding a small bonus for having others in your game? Possibly even allowing your public game to be changed to a private one while you're in it would be nice if it feasible so we can cut down on the jerks like the one I have mentioned in my story.

Thanks for your time reading this and I hope you all share your feelings about this or other issues you've come across.

The problem that I keep having is that on many of my characters, who are &lt;20, I value different stats than the game values. This could be my fault, if I am ignoring certain good stats, but I don't think so. It feels like this is because the upgrade suggestion system is not considering my character level. I have no proof or formulas to back this up, this is just from my observations.

For example:

* Weapon superiority seems to be based solely on the base damage, ignoring elemental damage or stat bonuses. 

* Similarly with armor, it values a higher damage reduction above all, ignoring stat bonuses.

* The potential upgrade level is valued above stat bonuses, even though I am unlikely to upgrade low level gear.

* The game will value stats to my level 20 ability on characters that are &lt;20.

The problem that this creates is that I cannot trust if an item is an upgrade just by looking for green, since it often undervalues stats that I want, and overvalues stats that I don't. This also means that I have to look through all of the red items as well.

I'm not sure how this could be fixed, given that each person/character may value different stats. Maybe if I could tell it in the options which item stats are important for a character and which aren't.

* Let Overcharge be used during the build phase

Using Overcharge is a pivotal ability for the Apprentice. When playing on Insane, there is a limited build time which makes it so you don't build as fast. Overcharge would come into play here, but you can't use it because you're in build phase.

* Have chests drop mana scaling to difficulty

* Have Challenges drop better/more rewards

With the recent sale of DD DLC on the Steam Sale, I figured, why not give it another go. 

I've searched through the forums a bit, found a few of the guides listed for breaking into NM, leveling, etc. However, these all seem to assume stats that are a bit higher than what I have. For instance, they suggest running Insane Glitter for exp, however, when I left I don't think I was quite able to solo it. Same with a lot of the other exp suggestions. Most of them assume 3/400 stats, however I think only maybe one or two of my characters break 200. 

Therefore, I feel like I hit a bit of a plateau where I'm not geared enough to do the things everyone in guides are talking about (heck, I failed hard Misty HC earlier), but I don't want to spend the next week leveling to 74 in Glitter Hard.

Any suggestions on how to get from where I'm at to where I should be (reading one of the guides, the guy talks about the hard baseline being 200+ in all stats)?

I used to play online on the PS3 all the time, because I tended to not have any issues with poor attitudes, etc. 

I hit my last straw last night. I was playing online with my best friend, and it was our first run on Karathiki Jungle. We decided to open it up for other people to join us since it's such a huge map and would have liked to get other players in on it. So, first wave... a dude jumps in, I'm setting up towers on my Countess (I DPS my Huntress) while said friend is placing some traps with the Ranger. We always switch over before the wave is done because these characters are NOT built for DPS at all on our games. This guy sees we have an entire side of our map unguarded, hits the crystal, then leaves. He comes back in to watch after the wave starts. 

I kicked him so he couldn't do it again after the wave was over (since we were scrambling to guard the other two crystals during). Next, we get someone who just keeps hitting their call button.. over and over. Not terrible, but not useful, either.

After that, a kid (he had to be 10 or 11..) get in there on his headset. I was talking to my friend as he came in, trying to discuss strategy, and this kid flips out and tells us to shut up, blah blah blah. 

We didn't get one decent player in, and I have yet to on the PC version. :[ I LOVE playing games socially, but, I hate that this community is just as muddled with trolls as DOTA and games of similar popularity. 

Is this common for you all, as well? Is there a better way to go about finding genuinely nice fellow defenders? I'm not the best at the game, but I still love it and want to be able to play with people online without being harassed or trolled.  

Any input is welcome! Thanks guys. ",,False,self,t5_2sf8u,False,,huntress-steam,True,t3_1h3zcc,http://www.reddit.com/r/dungeondefenders/comments/1h3zcc/struggling_to_find_nice_people_to_play_with_online/,

We are playing DD since some days. I played the game 1 year ago and i sold an egg back then for 1 billion. So i had alot of money to buy gear of my apprentice.  
Im 75 now, my tower dmg is over 700, the other tower stats all around 500. Im farming ramparts until wave 30 without any problems combined with lvl70 monk auras + summoner oger/healer.   
My friend plays a countess and also has decent stats around 400-700.  

We tested out the first map on nightmare and we died because of the stupid shark enemies that reposition your towers, followed up by too many ogers and dschins on the last wave.    

Do you have any ideas what we're doing wrong? How can we progress? Are the tower stats that low? Or is it probably mainly a setup problem?

My friend and I are working our way through DD right now, he plays a DPS Jester and I play a tower Summoner, and we are both level 73.  We can beat most of the levels on Insane (we have cleared the campaign on Insane, but not Insane HC). Yet we can't do any NM levels yet as we lack Mythical gear (we get slaughtered in waves 4/5 of Deeper Well on NM).

We should level to 74 within the week, but don't know what to do at this point.  We would like to avoid leveling other characters just to spawn towers with them (squire/app/etc) to complete NM, or resorting to buying other player's old Mythical gear.  We are stubbornly determined to accomplish this on our own with these two characters.

My questions are:
* Is it possible to do NM without more than 2 characters (in our case is it possible with JUST a Summoner and a Jester, no switching to others between waves)?
* How the hell do we break into NM and start getting mythical gear?  I have read a lot of the guides I can find online but they are either outdated or quickly contradicted by the next guide I read.  We got close to beating Alchemy Lab on Insane HC Survival (as one of the guides suggested), but we didn't quite have the right setup (3 kobolds slipped through and blew the crystal up).

So obviously I'm doing something wrong.  

------

Second, I see high level DPS characters routinely using the same type of weapon. I'd like to make a list, and get feedback of what I've recorded thus far.  So far I've noticed these weapons are commonly used: 

* **Squire**: Steam Saw, Eternian Greatsword, Frost Blade, Malificar's Rapier, Couteau

* **Huntress:** Pawn Shot, Retribution (spiders), Krytykal Stryke, Flamewave, Magic Lamp

* **Apprentice:** Staffaphone, Alternative Energy Core, Tsuda's Final Creation, Draconis 

* **Monk:** Cardboard Tube, Skyreaper, Ogre Party Hat, Monk Wrench

* **Barbarian:** 2x Steam Saw

* **Series EV:** Huntress stuff?

* **Jester:** Huntress stuff?

* **DPS Pets:** Companion Cube, Propeller Cat, Seahorse, Djinnlet, Cowboy Monkey, Chicken

What do you each use on high level characters?

My first character was a huntress.  It did well until I got to the last round of map 2.  I got rolled.  Just not enough damage and most of my traps were popped on the second last round.  This was all on normal difficulty.
Decided to try a barbarian next.  I made this character with my friend who made a summoner.  It worked quite well with that combination.  Reading up about how barbarians were more expensive because you need two weapons instead of one kind of put me off a bit.
My third character was a monk.  I got to level 10 and my other friend logs on insisting on being a monk.  So I changed to the squire.

I was amazed.  I was doing the early stages on insane difficulty being solo.  I leveled up quickly.  But now that I am reaching the eternia content, it just seems like there are a lot of choke points making it difficult to block things off.  I also read how huntress/monk are very powerful.  Nothing really much about the squire.   I just feel like I am hitting a wall on my strength, and the next step is once I hit 74 is farm mythical gear.

My main question is though...  Do I want to invest the time gearing up the squire?  Or do I want to use him more of a tower bot and then switch to a main damage dealing class like a monk or huntress?

**EV** - buff beams and physical beams

**Monk** - a Nightmare build will have Ensnare,Strength Drain and Electro Auras

**Summoner** - summoned Minions will provide singel target dps.

Recomended are also:

I was wondering, what's the best DLC to get, since there are so many to choose from.  Online wise, or map wise.  From what I've read while researching the game, I guess the more active maps people play are from DLC's?

I've had my eye on the Lost Eternia Shards Complete DLC for awhile, and I guess the majority of people playing this game has that DLC?

I looked at the official forums and there are only 6 posts! I have spent the past week trying to teach myself the DDDK (DunDef Dev Kit) which is based off of Unreal Engine 3 Editor. Its quite a handful to learn so quickly. 

I was just curious if anyone here is working on anything? Maybe we could get a team of people together to make a cool map. I was thinking of doing a true dungeon level. It seems odd but the game being called ""Dungeon Defenders"" doesn't seem to have a real dungeon in the game! I am thinking of torture areas, cell blocks, the whole shabang. If anyone wants to help me, or point me in the direction of some real fleshed out tutorials it would be greatly appreciated!

Currently I'm using Barbarian 73, her Apprentice 73. I also have a Monk at 70, and she has a Squire at 70. We have pretty low end gear. I think I have 200/240/150/100 in hero stats. She has roughly 130/220/160/160 in towers. The Monk is 130 in all. And the Squire is about 180/150/100/150.


Between us we have everything but hunter, and no one seems to use it very much so no big deal there. Now for the questions:

-Why do people say to use apprentice during the wave and not monk or adept? I tried out my monk when I got stuck because I didn't switch fast enough and tbh, Defense Boost seems pretty rad. Auto-aoe repair with boost to towers? Whats not to love? Surely better than knockback from apprentice? Someone explain this to me, I'm probably missing something. Equally the adept instant upgrade, and the purity bomb for taking out pesky necromancers seems really really good.

-Are we better off defending all routes with towers, while I roam on the barbarian. Or shall I just ""take a route"" and smash it to pieces. Up to now I take a slow aura, str drain aura and 2 walls and just destroy whatever comes that route. If my help is needed somewhere else the walls and auras hold up until I can get back.

-Apprentice walls, Squire walls. This is tough, squire walls are so much more expensive DU wise, but they're sooooo much better. For the points they're just sick amounts of hp.

-She has super low life. I mean her life stat is at 60 or thereabouts but she only have like 600 hp? Half the problem we have is we get to say wave 14 on Insane HC Ramparts Survival and a ninja/bomber with just catch her out and insta-kill her. Is this a problem with all apprentices or has something gone amiss?

-Unfortunately we have no Nightmare accesible to us at the moment. Insane Glitter survival the only way to go? Or are some of the challenge maps worthwhile? Halloween event map looks like it might be good, though hard as balls.

-Have you had a hug today? If you've read this far and answered you deserve one. Thanks a lot. If any other duos are out there and would like to play we are on most evenings shoot me a pm and we can sort something out 

Thanks a bunch.

Getting my Companion Cube later tonight, and I had a few thoughts to toss out during the day.

As I understand it, the Companion Cube is basically a combination Ranged DPS Pet and Genie, much in the same manner that the Goblin Cupid - for those of us who have struggled mightily to get one - is a combination of Ranged DPS and Fairy. 

So, with the only other notable exception being Guardians, with the arrival of the Cube and Cupid, are other pets even worth consideration?

I mean, I used to think of it like this:

Guardians - for Tower Hugging Ranged, not for melee whose guardian bonuses tend to be soaked on barricades and frontal auras/traps.
Genie - For early wave mana upgrading. Not to be used later - monster mana is sufficient. I question its use with the cube around, though...
Fairy - For multiple melee if part of your setup involves a ""melee pit"" so that you can devote more defenses elsewhere. Better used in pairs. See above, but now with the Cupid...
Dragon - the premiere AOE damage pet if you've got huntress traps around. Better for ranged damage than Robot/Animus because AOEs tend to hit more clustered around a character in combat.
Laser Robot/Animus - the premiere ranged damage pet if you DON'T have huntress traps around, because Dragons breathe, well, fire.
Steam Robot - the ""bodyguard"" pet with huge knockback, but care has to be taken he doesn't knock someone in a bad direction.
Giraffe - Pure builder who is logged off only.

I dunno. Those seem like the only pets worth anything, really. Griffons do lightning, sure, but why not just use a dragon for AOE? Same with the Chinese Dragons. All the other melee pets don't really seem to have a candle to hold to the Steam Robot.

So anyhow. Seeking thoughts. Seems like these days, it's either Guardian, Cube, Cupid, or maaaaybe Steam Robot. I question the use of anything else. Why even have a fairy or a genie when you can have a Cupid or a Cube performing the same function with damage included?",,False,self,t5_2sf8u,False,,,True,t3_r3ofz,http://www.reddit.com/r/dungeondefenders/comments/r3ofz/companion_cubes_goblin_cupids_etc_of_pets/,

I know that ""General Info"" sidebar over to the right is getting pretty full already, but I was wondering if this would be useful to add.  Sort of a ""Beginner's Primer""?

I'm new to the game and 120hrs in with a 74 App builder and a Huntress DPS, I've managed to get some half decent starter mythic armour in along with a starter mythic gatling gun. But I find myself in need of an ungodly amount of armour to upgrade things.

To that end I've started a builder Monk and have been using this layout: http://html5.cubicleninja.com/dd/index.htm?layout=14180
