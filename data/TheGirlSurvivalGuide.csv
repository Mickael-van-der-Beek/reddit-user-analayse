1371584869.0,753,self.TheGirlSurvivalGuide,1glsy5,I would like to share my abortion experience....,Halcyoningenue,908,155,228,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/1glsy5/i_would_like_to_share_my_abortion_experience/,"When finding out my partner of 8 months and I were pregnant, we knew the only option was to abort it. We are both sophomores in college, and definitely not financially or emotionally ready to start a family. 


Since I found out my pregnancy early on, I decided to miscarry it naturally since my friends in the past have successfully done so. After two weeks of trying, and not even a cramp occurring, I gave up on a natural abortion and started making plans with planned parenthood.


Planned parenthood was courteous and after a few appointments for a pregnancy test, and learning about contraceptives to start after the procedure, my appointment was scheduled and I was ready to go.


Yesterday, my friend and I drove to planned parenthood and then proceeded to wait about two hours after signing in, which is really my only complaint about the day. They had me take a vaginal ultrasound, and gave me the option of looking at the image, keeping a picture of it, telling me if I had twins or not, or if I didn't want to know anything at all. I chose to not know, to keep as much emotional detachment to this process as possible. They then showed me to another room where a lady gave me a cup of multiple pills where she explained exactly what they were and what they did. She said they were basically to get me drowsy and to help with anxiety before the procedure. She than placed me in the waiting room till the pills kicked in and I was ready to start the procedure. 


I met my doctor who would be performing the abortion, and he was kind and asked me how I was feeling, and if at any time I was too uncomfortable to let him know. He left for me to undress, while the nurse at hand and an intern who asked to be present stood by in case I toppled over from the medication. I sat on the table and draped the paper over my lap, put my feet in the stirrups, and the doctor returned. During the abortion he explained everything he did before he was about to do it to put me at ease. He would tell me when he was about to do something that made cramping, and the nurse would automatically rub my lower belly, and the intern would be standing by asking if I needed the hot water bottle. But the cramping I experienced from the abortion was much less than the cramping I had experienced from just a regular period. The really only pain I would say I experienced was just the slight pressure of inserting the speculum to open the vaginal canal, and also the pressure of opening the cervix. The actual suction of the abortion was basically painless. 
Within 7 min. the abortion was done, and the doctor went in another room to examine the tissue to see if the abortion was complete. He returned, said it was a success, and asked how I felt and If I had any more questions. I replied I felt fine, and he wished me luck and left. The nurse helped me get dressed, even though I had no nausea or pain, then escorted me to the recovery room where a nice older lady gave me another heating pad and drinks and snacks. She asked me after awhile to check my pad and tell her the amount of blood was there, for safety just in case I didn't clot properly. Only a small amount existed, and I was able to sit in the waiting room for as long as I wanted. I left soon after, and I am relieved to say I've never felt better.


I know this story is very undramatic and simple, but I wanted girls to know that abortion is not a scary horrible thing that people make it out to be. It happens every day to normal women, and after there doesn't have to be guilt or depression, sometimes there is relief and a feeling of wholeness again. I had an extremely pleasant experience with my abortion, and still plan on it being my last. Before the procedure I asked to have the Nexplanon inserted, so now I know I'll be pregnancy free for the next three years! 
I welcome any and all questions, and remember to be smart and safe so this isn't a story you will have to tell one day.

Peace!

**tltr: had an surgical abortion that was very pleasant, wanted to share story for education purposes**



**EDIT:** By posting this I was aiming for just a basic medical account of what exactly happened and a whole can of worms exploded! I mean it in the best way possible, because lets face it: Female problems aren't frilly, perfect, sparkly badges that we wear on our dresses. They are scars of experiences that were earned through blood, sweat, and emotional turmoil. And I think it is our job and duty as women to keep it honest between each other and the rest of society, on exactly what we go through and to be as supportive as possible. Because women know what is best for women, and this post just fills me with joy seeing all these brave women share their stories with details that would make the manliest man squirm in his pants! What I mean is, this post affirms in me the fact that we need to, as women, take what we have said here into the real world and share the raw facts with others in our daily lives. I would love to see these conversations being had openly some day with girls faced with this decision from their friends, or mothers, or grandmothers, and without judgment. Because I know I didn't have that growing up. I just wanted to thank you all for making this post more than just a discussion, and more of a support group for women now, and in the future. Thank you and Peace!

1/4 c coconut oil (solid)
1/2 c fine sugar
Generous squeeze of FRESH lime (not bottled)
Mix it all up 

Get in the shower. Wait a few minutes so the hair softens. Use conditioner to shave (also did my underarms). After shaving go to town using the sugar scrub all over that sexy body, face to feet. 


Rinse then shave again using conditioner. 


The first time you shave the hair. The second time you've loosened all that nasty dead skin. There was some nasty dead skin in my razor, make sure to rinse it thoroughly and often.

That being said, we still need to be careful. Everyone does. 

There's a bar in my town that's known to be a little skeazy. My friends and I would only tend to go there late at night after visiting some nicer places, when we just want to have some beer and dance. The bartender is this great woman who knows the bar for what it is, but still takes care of people. There are frequently incidents there that involve the police, but people don't generally get seriously hurt.

The other night a girl I don't know was drugged. I don't know if she was alone or with friends, but apparently the place was packed full of people. She somehow ended up in the women's bathroom (single toilet, locks from the inside) where she was raped by 10 men. The drugs were in a stage where she was still awake, but couldn't move her body. 

This scenario absolutely terrifies me. One night I was out with friends at this same bar and some guy about 10 years older than me starts talking to me. We have a halfway decent conversation when I get up to use the bathroom. When I get back my girls had left the bar and were dancing, which left my drink alone with the stranger. I still drank from it (stupid) but after a little while I started feeling sick and way too intoxicated for how much I drank. I had one of my friends take me home where I slept it off. I'm pretty certain I was drugged. I never saw that guy around town again.

Be safe, girls. Even people who appear benign and friendly can be very sick individuals. I love going to bars and hanging out, some of my friends go home with random guys sometimes. We pick and choose our risky behavior and some of us get away with it. I don't think women shouldn't go home with men if they want to, I definitely don't think women should avoid bars.

1. Spend some time in a nice hot bath (or shower). I like to read to pass the time.
1. Use a sugar scrub all over your body to get rid of the dead skin.
1. Shave legs/pits/bits.
1. Rub coconut oil (or baby oil) all over damp skin - I drain the bath at this point and just have the shower running, then I wash my hair to let the oil sink in for a few minutes.
1. Use exfoliating gloves and shower gel to scrub away the excess oil.
1. Shake off the water, blot any very wet areas (underboob, I'm looking at you) and rub body lotion onto the damp skin, let dry.

I've done this twice in four days, the other days I've just showered using the exfoliating gloves *lightly* then smoothing body lotion on damp skin. 

I'm also slathering my feet in foot cream and putting cotton socks on overnight, to prepare my crusty wintery feet for summer sandals.

Warning: results in skin so ridiculously soft and smooth that your housemates will soon be annoyed of you constantly whining ""go on, just touch it! touch iiiiiiit!!""

It's easy to apply and no one can tell when you mess up, and it makes your nails look clean and shiny.

- Keeping your eyebrows shaped and groomed. Nice eyebrows center the face and make you look polished even without makeup.

- If you need to look fancy but hate makeup, just use lipstick. Something that's not bright but is obviously not natural will make it look like you put in effort!

- Blistex chap stick. It is moisturizing as hell, and if you apply it thickly, it makes your lips supple and dewy for *hours*.

- Always wear earrings, just some small, sparkly studs. If you have two sets of holes, just buy and smaller and bigger pair of little, diamond-like studs (from Claire's or something) and wear them every day. They don't get in your way, and they make you look like you actually give a shit about your appearance. Plus, if they fall out or get lost somehow, it's no biggie because they were 6 bucks.

- Shirts. If you have to look ""business professional"" every day, instead of attempting a new kind of outfit every single day, just buy 2-3 matching sets of slacks and blazers (eg. black, gray, and tan), and then you only have to worry about switching blouses! Just look for some with ruffles or other interesting/defining feature.

- Instantly look less manly in the fall/winter/spring by adding a scarf. They sell millions of patterns, just grab one to throw on when you're just going out in jeans and a coat.

- To look Christmas-y or extra stylish, go with red nails. They're classic, edgy, and everyone likes them.

This way you can ""build"" your own earring card and get all the earrings you actually want without adding to the earring graveyard in the back of the jewelry box. If you just want one (like for a cartilage piercing) that's fine. You only get the ones you want.

It was a great day in SF, completely cloudless with a cool breeze and just about perfect in every way. 

I have fair skin so I put sunscreen all over my face and ears (I remembered my ears, amazing!). I didn't put it on anywhere else because I was covered from wrists to ankles with clothing.

[Guess what I forgot?](http://i.imgur.com/JuRUOS1)

Oh boy, did that burn hurt! My hand was crispy. I moisturized it and used aloe vera for the next week. It eventually blistered and peeled.

About a month later I developed a little spot on the back of my hand that crusted and bled. I thought I bumped it so I put Neosporin on it for a few days, but no dice on the healing. I eventually went to see a dermatologist who said it was an [actinic keratosis](http://www.skincancer.org/skin-cancer-information/actinic-keratosis), a type of precancerous lesion. She froze it off and asked to see me in a month to follow up. In that time, I developed two more of these. 

Now I have to use a four week course of [topical therapy.](http://i.imgur.com/3VlIfnj.jpg?1) And guess what? The retail cost for this drug is around $235! 

**The lesson here is: BE YE NOT SO STUPID AND DON'T FORGET THE SUNSCREEN.** Seriously, about .25 worth of sunscreen might have prevented me from having to go to a dermatologist three times, buy expensive cream that irritates my skin (but hopefully successfully treats my spots), endure the freezing of a section of my skin, and increase my risk for skin cancer overall!

Taking a shower is one of my favorite moments of the day, because to me it is relaxing. So I figured, hey why not make the most of it !

So about 30 min before bed, I started the shower, closed the lights, and hopped in.
And it was really nice! I got a little bit of moonlight from the small window (which is in the shower directly), just enough to not fall to my death as I climbed in. 

I stayed there a full 15min, and I felt really at peace and calm. The absence of light sort of shutted down my ''chattery'' brain and let me feel the water of my skin, and appreciate the calm and the dark.

I dried myself and went right off to bed, without opening any other lights. I was much more calm, and felt asleep much faster than I have for months.

So here it is, my soothing shower in the night experience :)

I just wanted to add my commentary for anyone that is considering getting a menstrual cup, since we talk about them often enough on this subreddit. 

My thoughts (in the order I had them):

1. This is not a good idea for a young girl who is new to having her period. I had enough trouble with tampons when I first started with them, this cup requires that you be much more comfortable and familiar with your ladybits. 

2. Getting it out is a bit challenging... you must push with your pelvic floor. Luckily, I have kegels like a beast.

3. HOLY CRAP This is also not for the faint of heart. I really underestimated how weird it would be to look at a small cup of my own blood. Was anyone else weirded out by this? 


4. This is totally awesome. I'm never buying tampons again.

Works best if your hair is still slightly damp.

2. **Large pores? Egg white facial!**  
Crack an egg. Separate the white and yolk, putting the white in a bowl and discarding the yolk. Apply the white to your face, allow it to dry, and then rinse it off. 

3. **Sleep with your hair braided for awesome waves in the morning.**

4. **While brushing your teeth, use your tooth brush gently on your lips to remove dead skin.**

5. **Drinks plenty of water.**  
This helps with everything from dry skin to acne to your general health. 

6. **Cracked dry feet? Lotion + cotton socks before bed.**

7. **Brush your teeth with baking soda to whiten your smile.**

8. **Swollen, puffy skin under your eyes? Try a small amount of Preparation H.**

9. **DO NOT WASH YOUR FACE TOO MUCH!**  
Not only does it dry your skin out, but it can sometimes lead to break outs. 

10. **Always take your makeup off before bed!**  
Keep makeup remover wipes next to your bed if you have to, but get that shit off your face before you pass out.

11. **Vitamins**  
Your hair, nails, and skin will thank you.

12. **Shave in two directions to achieve the smoothest of pits.**

13. **If you have light brows, fill 'em in.**  
It can be scary at first and it takes some getting used to, seeing yourself with brows, but eyebrows are very crucial to your face. Fill those suckers in.

14. **A dab of shimmery white shadow in the inner corners of your eyes will make them look bigger and brighter.**

15. **Use brown sugar to exfoliate.**  
But no more than twice a week.

1367184032.0,171,self.TheGirlSurvivalGuide,1dalh9,[TIP] I've been suffering from moderate acne since I was a teenager. Recently swapped out my arsenal of Neutrogena products with tea tree oil castile soap/pure tea tree oil and my face has NEVER been clearer! I'm so excited! Details inside...,handsopen,200,29,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/1dalh9/tip_ive_been_suffering_from_moderate_acne_since_i/,"I have been using Neutrogena oil-free acne wash for the past 10-12 years; it was the only product I found that could keep my acne under control, and I tried a LOT of products when I first hit puberty and started having complexion problems. My T zone (forehead, nose, and chin) is the most problematic, though just within the last few months I've started getting a field of pimples on both of my cheeks, too. I would say my acne problems are moderate - bad enough to cause my doctor to ask me if I'm interested in taking medication for it, but not bad enough that I accepted or that I can't keep it under control with OTC products.

This is what my skin care arsenal used to look like:

-Neutrogena oil free acne wash in the shower every morning ($7)

-St. Ives exfoliating Apricot Scrub once a week ($5)

-Neutrogena Exfoliating Body Clear Body Scrub every day for my back and boobs ($8)

-Neutrogena Rapid Clear Acne Treatment Pads before bed every night ($7)

This worked pretty well for me, though I did get stray zits fairly often - maybe 1-2 per week. Also, my face was shiny ALL THE TIME which is why I started looking into a natural alternative - I'm pretty sure using all of these products, while it was mostly successfully at keeping acne away, it dried my face out too much and caused my skin to produce more oil to compensate. 

Now my skin care routine looks like this:

-[Dr. Bronner's tea tree oil castile soap](http://www.amazon.com/Dr-Bronners-Magic-Soaps-Pure-Castile/dp/B00120VWJ0/) ($2.50 for a small 4 oz bottle at my local health food store) - I use this in place of the face and body wash every day. It's going to last me MONTHS at least - it's super concentrated, so I only need about 4 *drops* of it for my whole face!

**EDIT: Deleted the part about exfoliating with baking soda, it's actually really bad for you! Thanks, /u/smilehappyonion, i won't be doing that again. Does anyone else have an idea for an all natural exfoliator?**

-Pure tea tree oil ($7 at my local health food store) - I mix 1-2 drops of it in my moisturizer every morning. At night before bed, I rinse my face with water and then put about 3 drops of it on a moistened cotton ball, dab it on my face, and let it dry.

**EDIT 2: /u/poursalt brings up a good point -- BE VERY CAREFUL to not get either Dr. Bronners tea tree soap or pure tea tree oil in your eyes. It hurts like a mother (much worse than regular soap) and might incapacitate your vision temporarily.**

All in all, my new routine is cheaper, more natural, and works better. I haven't gotten a single pimple since I started a couple of weeks ago, which is CRAZY. My face is still a little shiny but not NEARLY as bad as it used to be. And have I mentioned my skin hasn't looked this clear since I was a kid!? I honestly did not know my skin could ever look this good again.

The magic ingredient here is clearly tea tree oil, which is a natural antibacterial and antiseptic, but since it's an oil it's not harsh on your skin like salicylic acid. I am not sure if this would work for something with severe or cystic acne, but it doesn't hurt to try.

She informed me that they were recategorizing many medical items as ""lifestyle choices"". Therefore, with this new label, they won't cover it. At all. This is, specifically, as a ""pressure tactic against the oncoming AHA changes"".  

Some of the items being recategorized:

- Birth control (The only BC they will cover any more will be generic pill BC, all others will have to be paid for by you, 100% of the cost)
- Epi-pens (SERIOUSLY WUT)
- Hormone therapy
- Laser surgery (I questioned about surgery for potentially cancerous moles. ""Oh, they're turning down almost all laser surgery after this."")

The agent was beyond angry about all the changes, and warned me to switch now, because the biggest part of all the switch was going to happen in December. The part she was maddest about was that even though they were removing all birth control from coverage....they're now covering name brand Viagra. 100%. It's a ""medical necessity"". 

So...yeah. If you're on Anthem/Blue Cross, might want to check into your policy...or start looking elsewhere. 

-----------
Edit: My husband said I should also note that they also removed preventative care off of my policy. I wasn't aware that they did it, and I'm now looking at paying $200 for my yearly gyno visit, out of pocket. FUN.

Also, I to clarify the $475/mo....I am a freelancer, so I have to pay for my own insurance. Its really, *really* expensive to cover a mom and two kids. We tried to get on my husband's insurance at his work, but they use Anthem, and we were told it'd cost $775 a month to get us on the plan. *Seriously they are evil.*

--------
Second Breakfast Edit: There seems to be the possibility this is a rollout for certain states...although, the agent had told me this would be a national change by the end of the year. I have spoken with my friends in VA, WV, and OH....aaaand they found out their epipens are not covered, nor BC. I myself am in VA. 

I just...I don't even know what to say about all of this. All I can say is, **check with your insurance if you have Anthem. Ask them what is going on, and if (and god forbid, when) they will be doing that to yours. Its always, ALWAYS best to check.**",,False,self,t5_2vfzu,1375249012.0,,,True,t3_1jdy3f,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/1jdy3f/psa_a_certain_insurance_company_is_removing_bc/,

Well, I went to the doctor and it turns out, it is a staph infection. But luckily, according to my doctor, it looks easily treatable and very normal for an infection. I was given antibiotics and a heavy duty antibiotic ointment. I'm already seeing results. 

He didn't think I would need any heavy disinfecting for my bras (since I was wearing bandages all the time), he just suggested washing them normally. But I decided to take the advice some people gave me and washed my bras with vinegar. I filled my sink with hot water, added a cup of vinegar, and a generous amount of detergent. I let them soak for about 30 minutes and then I washed them in my washing machine on the ""handwash"" cycle. If your washing machine doesn't have this cycle, I recommend regularly handwashing them. 

I was really impressed at how clean they looked. I had yellowish stains around the underwire and near the armpit area, and I was never able to wash them out. But the vinegar soak cleaned them like new. No more yellow stains!

A healthy diet leads to a beautiful you.

50) Use excess eye cream on cuticles.

49) For smudge-proof eye makeup, take blotting tissue to remove any oil or any excess makeup from the eye area.

48) To prevent hair color from fading in the summer months, use a conditioning treatment weekly or bi-monthly.

47) Breakout before a big event? “Take oral cortisone a few days before the event to clear your skin”- Ava Shamban, dermatologist and author of Heal Your Skin.

46) Always allow about two fingers from your nose to where blush starts.

45) “Balance out your shimmer. If youre doing a shimmery eye, do matte lips”- Raychel Wade, founder of Cheek to Chic and La Prairie’s colour ambassador

44) Brush out your curls with your fingers to give your hair a more tousled look.

43) To make your manicure last, apply a thin layer of clear every two days.

42) Wear white eyeliner to make eyes appear less red.

41) “Take a shimmery gloss to the center of your lips, top and bottom – this will attract light to your lips, making them look pouty.”-Katrina Barrion, makeup artist for Giella Custom Blend Cosmetics

40) For slicked back hair, use a serum.

39) For the perfect cat-eye, “select a thin liner brush that is tapered to the point”- Pamela Taylor, makeup artist

38) To make your cheek bones appear higher, use bronzer under the cheekbone and highlighter on the actual cheekbone.

37) Before you blow dry, start with a volumizing spray or light gel to give the roots some lift.

36) For fuller lips, extend the lip line using a flesh tone lip liner. Be careful not to go overboard!

35) To fake clear skin when you notice a pimple, “Apply tea tree oil as soon as you spot it”- Stephanie Flor, makeup artist

34) For clear skin, look for a cleanser with salycilic acid.

33) When choosing a red lipstick, you just want to remember to get one that looks good with your undertone. If you have a warm undertone, then go for warmer reds, and if you have a cool undertone, then go cooler.

32) Sunscreens that claim to provide “all-day protection” and “water resistance” are not reliable; don’t be fooled by these claims and reapply all sunscreens at least every two to three hours.

31) When self-tanning, use a tanner with a guide color. “It will give you instant color before the effect and it will show you exactly where you put the color and where you may have missed”- Sinead Norenius, founder of Beautisol

30) “If you’re afraid of red lipstick, I love putting it on and then blotting it off to wear it as more of a stain”- Pat McGrath, makeup artist

29) For the summer months, you don’t want to be caked down in foundation so try a tinted moisturizer instead.

28) Use blotting papers to manage oil and shine in your T-Zone “which are also great for cleaning up around the eyes”- Rebecca Restrepo, makeup artist

27) The antihistamines in allergy medicine dry out the skin, so skip heavy foundation during allergy season. Instead, use a tinted moisturizer.

26) Use an exfoliater to get rid of dead skin but limit yourself to 2-3 times a week so you don’t dry out your skin.

25) Pick a sulfate-free shampoo, as sulfates can be harsh and drying on the hair cuticle.

24) If you have greasy hair, avoid directly conditioning roots and condition from your ear down to ends.

23)”When you wear a red lip it’s important that it stays exactly where you put it. Using a long wearing lip pencil to create the perfect shape and a lip color are key to having a perfect red lip.”-Kristofer Buckle, celebrity makeup artist

22) To make volume last all day, avoid running your fingers through hair. “Oil from your hands can weigh down your roots leaving your hair flat at the end of the day”-Tatum Neill, Arrojo Studio

21) Try to avoid washing your hair everyday. Constant shampooing leaves hair dry and your scalp will create more oils to compensate for the loss of moisture.

20) Remember, clean brushes to fight against potential bacteria and breakouts!

19) Clean out your makeup bag at least once a year to get rid of old products that may be expired or you no longer use.

18) If you don’t have nail polish remover, apply clear nail polish over and then wipe off. It will remove old polish.

17) To add volume to clean or unwashed hair, use a dry shampoo spray.

16) When applying bronzer, “first start by applying it around the perimeter of your face and follow with a light dusting on your forehead, nose and chin”- Mally Roncal, Mally Beauty

15) To get curls when you have straight hair, use the following, “a volumizer or volume thickening agent, a curl enhancing product, light holding finishing spray”- Vicktor Stevenson, Hair Stylist

14)To revive curls mid-day, “Take a very small amount of pomade and put it in the palms of your hands. Rub them together. Next gently smooth the pomade over your curls and scrunch just a little bit”-Eugene Davis, celebrity hair stylist

13) “Use your concealer as a base on your eyelids”-Melissa Silver, Maybelline makeup artist

12) Exfoliate before applying self tanner to get rid of dead skin. Tanning products tend to cling to dryer areas.

11) To minimize pores, use a pore-minimizing facial wash followed by a toner. Make sure the toner is alchohol-free so it won’t dry out your skin.

10)To mask split ends, use an iron to straighten ends and then apply a hair repair cream.

9)To fix brassy hair color, use a color-depositing shampoo with purple tones. For unwanted redness, use a color-depositer with a green tone.

8) To contour cheeks, use a matte powder (a few shades darker than your skin tone) with an angled brush. Blend on temples and under cheek bone.

7) When using a cream product, lock it in by using a translucent powder over it.

6) To create a lived-in look for your hair, use thickening or sea-salt mist before you blow-dry. Follow by running a volumizing or texture cream through hair.

5) When buying “organic” beauty products, make sure to check if they are FDA certified organic. This will prevent you from getting scammed.

4) After using a a hair conditioning mask, follow with “a cold water rinse to close the hair cuticles”- Ursala Stephensen, Motions celebrity stylist

3) To get your braid to last all day, try styling hair that’s “dirty with product”. This will make the style stick longer.

2) Use a clarifying shampoo once a week to get rid of any product build-up that may have occured during the week.

1. I dye my hair red and want to minimise colour fading.
1. I'm really lazy. 

In the summer months, I don't want to be washing my hair every single day. Dry shampoo gives me more volume and texture, and keeps my hair matte and fresh.

**DON'T** spray it all over your head as if it was hairspray. Unless grey hair is the look you're going for, then by all means.

**DO** use a comb to make a number of partings across your hair - spray down each parting, along the roots. This gets the dry shampoo exactly where you need it, and minimises the white/grey powdery residue.

After spraying, massage your hair with fingers to really work it in, and brush it out.

My big tip here though, is **USE IT THE NIGHT BEFORE!** I've found that it really has time to soak up the excess oils, there's no white residue left behind, and your hair's a lot softer than just after the initial application.

Works for me every time, and if I know I probably should wash my hair tomorrow but might not have time in the morning, I give my hair a quick spray and brush through. When I wake up and run a brush/comb/fingers through it, it feels fresh and bouncy, matte, and with some texture (great for a quick ponytail/bun).

Here's a few rare tips for you ladies!,andyetanotherkiwi,159,27,82,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/13lhhk/battled_acne_since_i_was_10_years_old_and_i/,"I got my first pimple at age 9, actual acne/breakouts at age 10, and suffered a lot from it since. But I've learned a lot of great things along the way and there seems to be so many misconceptions from beauty magazines and the internet, so I wanted to share you things I know. Here we go!

1. **Dermatologists are not always the best source.** Most dermatologists specialize in serious skin issues such as skin cancer. Many don't really understand acne as well as you would think. I went through three separate dermatologists who were all considered the top of their practice in my city (a large metropolitan city). But it's usually a painful cycle of trying this anti-biotic then that anti-biotic. Then they'll try whatever prescription creams they can on you as if its just a laundry list. I know too many acne sufferers who wasted their money. *If you choose to go to a dermatologist or any other licensed skin specialist, make sure they are specifically specialized in acne.* 

2. **Quit dairy.** Get your calcium from non-dairy options or vitamins. Milk should be substitued with almond, NOT SOY, milk. Almond milk tends to have less sugar (and calories!) and soy has potential to make acne worse. Goat cheese is your best cheese option, or dairy-free cheese. Lactose-free dairy products could still be dairy products. 

3. **Regularly change your pillowcase.** This is a VERY important tip! It does make a difference!

4. **Do NOT use face washes and shampoos with sodium lauryl sulfate/sodium laureth sulfate** ammonium lauryl sulfate is okay, I've never heard of anybody break out specifically from it. *Cetaphil face wash is an acne nightmare.* Don't use it! Avoid fragranced products as well. 

5. **Do not overeat eat anything with iodine** This includes certain supplements and seaweed. Iodine triggers acne. 

6. **Birth controls, particularly Yaz or Ortho-tri cyclen, can help** But some can harm, so ask an expert before using it. 

7. **Use benzoyl peroxide starting with no more than 2.5%, then if necessary upgrading to 5% after a while.** Never go over 5%. 10% can be used but only for spot treatment, and use a q-tip to treat. 

8. **Eat dark chocolate to stop sweet cravings, but avoid other sweets as much as possible.** I shoot for 80% dark. 

9. **Use powder face makeup.** Powders as foundation can give adequate coverage and are far less likely to cause breakouts. Liquids and creams are usually too heavy and can clog pores, even if labeled oil-free or non-comedonegenic. I recommend Almay face powder or even Bare Minerals which has good coverage. 

10. **You MUST wear sunscreen every day, even if it's cloudy or winter-time.** I recommend Elta sunscreens, they are lightweight and don't cause breakouts, I personally use them. Don't use a moisturizer if your skin is oily, a sunscreen can double as one.  Look for sunscreens with physical blocks, like zinc oxide. Invest in a good sunscreen so you don't spend hundreds on anti-aging products later.

I was one of the recent ""convertees"" who was introduced to coconut oil through this subreddit. I used it everyday as a moisturizer and it was starting to get rid of my Keratosis pilaris, it was a miracle product! I would stick in my hand, wet or dry into the jar to scoop it out to apply to my skin after a shower or I would use a wet spoon I had run over hot water.

What I didn't know was I was introducing water and bacteria, the perfect ingredients for mold into the coconut oil. After about a month of use I noticed [these](http://imgur.com/a/h8v7W#0) dark spots on the bottom of my container. It is mold. 

Wondering how it got there I googled around and found that lots of fellow ladies are having this problem! Since people use it for hair care, moisturizing, and sometimes shaving many people were simply keeping the jar in the shower or bathroom causing it to be exposed to water frequently and films of mold to grow on their coconut oil. People in the kitchen using it as an oil substitute were sticking their wet utensils in it to scoop it out and causing the same.
[Example 1,](http://paleohacks.com/questions/54172/mold-growing-in-coconut-oil#axzz2JPnPbqaZ) [Example 2](http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20120311180437AAQE4LI) [Example 3.](http://naturalliving.livejournal.com/6175566.html)

From [this artcicle](http://www.naturalnotts.com/1/post/2012/08/got-mold-in-your-coconut-oil.html) I found a helpful breakdown;
&gt;**How Does This Happen?**

&gt;Dipping a wet utensil into your jar to scoop some out.

&gt;Placing wet, moist or dry fingers into your jar whilst using your product.

&gt;Leaving the lid off, allowing the content to come into contact with  a moist, humid atmosphere. (Different rooms in your home may have different temperatures. 


&gt;**How to Minimize Coconut Oil Contamination** 

&gt;Always store your oil in a cool dry place. 

&gt;Always use a dry, clean utensil to remove your oil, when it's in a solid state.

&gt;Always put the lid on after you've taken out what you need.


So I just wanted to warn you girls and all the new coconut oil users to keep your coconut oil in a cool place and away from moisture and always use clean and DRY ways of getting your oil out. Otherwise you'll end up like me with a spoiled $10 jar of it! : )

For a while we would only have sex on average once every three or four weeks. This was mostly due to our busy schedules, but also, well... we've been together for 4 years and the spark has died down a bit. Boyfriend would be horny and I would just feel totally detached from my lady parts. At some point I realized that Boyfriend was way more into sex (more sensitive) the less we did it, and I was way more into sex (more sensitive) the more we did it. It's like I have to continuously remind myself that I am a sexual being.

So, what do I do about all of this? The secret is masturbation. If I can just keep up with it 2 or 3 times a week, then I am much more likely to enjoy Boyfriend's advances. I know. I'm kinda making this sound like a chore, but unfortunately I'm not blessed with a higher sex drive, and this one trick has helped my relationship in many ways over the years.

my story: I've only had one partner, we've been having sex for a year and a half, the first six months were great, it didn't even hurt the first time and we never even needed lube. Six months in and I got my first expirience with painful sex, he kept talking about how tight I felt while we were doing it so I assumed I was clenching too hard. Time goes by and we started using lube, the sex is only painful occasionally but after a little while it starts becoming painful more often than not, recently it got to the point were it was ALWAYS painful. I still thought I was just clenching too hard because google searches, talking with my BFF, reading posts on /r/sex and my boyfriend all pretty much said that that was the most likely cause. At this point I was *really* stupid to not have gone to a doctor yet, but we were hardly ever having sex and I was convinced until recently that I was clenching too hard and just needed more lube and to learn how to relax. But then I taught myself to stop being afraid of painful sex, I was totally relaxed, there was lube, foreplay and fingering to get me ready, and... it was still painful. I was also occasionally noticing a little bit of blood after sex, but had had my period start early and spotting occur due to sex before so I thought it was just more of that. Turns out my labia were TEARING during sex, and that's why it was painful no matter what. My gyno prescribed me some estrogen cream to make the skin down there ""more plump"" and I should be ready to have sex again in a week (though she suggested I still use a *lot* of lube, and to never ever have sex without it again). I WAS AN IDIOT. don't be an idiot! go to your doctor! I feel so frustrated because I ruined a years worth of sex for me and my boyfriend by not going to a doctor and just assuming I knew what was wrong with me and that I knew how to fix it. again, because I feel like its worth repeating: I WAS AN IDIOT, LEARN FROM MY MISTAKES AND DON'T BE AN IDIOT, if you're having painful sex go to your doctor, don't try to figure it out on your own. Worst case scenario they confirm that you're just clenching too hard and give you some tips about how to relax, but they might actually have a real solution for you.

Also, in line with that, I think one of the reasons I put it off for so long was because I was slightly nervous/embarrassed at the thought of getting an exam done, but it wasn't nearly as scary as I thought it would be! I thought it was going to be a very long, very uncomfortable procedure but it only took a few minutes to get my entire annual exam done. It didn't really feel that uncomfortable physically and my doctor was really good at making me feel comfortable mentally throughout the process, so don't let that get in the way of scheduling an appointment either.  

**TDLR**: I thought I was having painful sex because I was clenching too much and that I could fix the problem by learning how to relax more during sex, it took a long time to learn how to relax and it didn't help, it was still painful. I went to my gyno and found out my labia have been tearing, and that it wasn't because I was clenching too hard. I wasted a year having painful sex because I thought I knew what was wrong with me when I really didn't and put off going to the doctor because of that, when one trip to the gyno could have had me fixed up within a week.

I read that some people slept on silk pillow cases to prevent hair from creasing, so I came up with the idea to tie my hair back with a silk or satin ribbon. After trying a few things, I found that if I wrapped my hair twice with the ribbon (like putting it back in a ponytail) and tied it in a bow, it would hold my hair firm enough so it wouldnt be all over the place, and while I slept it would become looser so it wouldnt cause my hair to get all crinkled. My hair never creases anymore, and its so much easier to manage now, especially on early busy mornings! It's also pretty cute if you ask me.

Hickies are large amounts of broken blood cells near the surface of your skin (like a bruise). So your goal is to break up these blood cells and get them deeper in your skin to remove color.

Solution? Sharpie cap or lip stick tube cap (Note: not the actual sharpie. You're using the cap for the shape). You want a rounded tip, essentially. Put some lotion on your hickie (lubrication), and then rub hard with the tip of the cap (its easier to hold if you keep the cap on the pen).

(my landlord sucks) so i can only shower at friends places once in a while when schedules coincide.  Therefore, I've figured out a few key tricks to looking presentable when it's been 3 days since my last shower.

1) DRY SHAMPOO IS YOUR FRIEND.  I ran out, of course and being cheap, my new friend is actually baby powder.  I think this might be an obvious one but i just discovered it and its so much cheaper and i'm in love.  I sprinkle a ton of that shit all over my head and make parts on the sides and in the back, brush it out and do a little round brush blowdrying and it works for day two and sometimes day 3.  usually day 3 and 4 i concede to hats.

2) Makeup remover and toner.  I loathe washing my face in cold water.  I've been wetting a face cloth and putting it in the microwave occasionally, but the best and easiest 'face washing' method i've discovered is make up remover on the eyes and using toner on the rest of my face.  I have fairly oily skin and my toner is mattifying but it seems to keep my oil in check under my makeup.  My pores have definitely been happier with me but exfoliating with cold water just isn't worth it.

3)Washing your bits and pits. (and deodorant)  I've been boiling water in my tea kettle and putting it in a large bowl and use a facecloth to wipe down the important parts (armpits and lady parts mostly).  Not showering regularly has been a killer on my girlie bits, not something i even considered before all this.  I think it gave me a yeast infection but at least rinsing down daily has helped to clear that up.  

4)Do laundry.  I'm pretty bad usually about doing my laundry.  I dont have it in my building and i get lazy with my hectic schedule so i usually just wait till i have one clean pair of underwear left before i have to.  Having fresh clean clothes to put on, not the pants i've worn 4 times already definitely helps with the inevitable smell factor and definitely with the morale. 

5) Do your makeup!!  So it's probably not the best for the skin, not washing regularly and putting make up on every day.  Plus when i'm freezing and dirty i tend to just wanna sit in my pjs and look like shit all day.  But when you have to face the world nothing pulls you together like a good face of makeup.  plus it's fun.

I can't imagine i really had any great helpful tips, but figured i share anyways!  

TL;DR If you cant shower, baby powder, toner, face cloths, laundry and makeup are your new best friends.

My hair is super fine and about halfway down my back, and always just looks kinda sad in a ponytail. But with Perfect Pony in, it looks amazing. The before and after shots on the product box are accurate.

I think it's super comfortable (can't even feel it), and I did lots of swinging my head around and jumping and it never showed. Plus, it stays — and NOTHING stays in my hair. Even those velvety-grippy headbands slip out. But I would play volleyball with this in and not worry at all.

A lot of the reviews say it's tricky to use, but I honestly didn't think it was (and I'm no hair whiz). You just gather the top half of your hair, place the Perfect Pony underneath and grab with the same hand holding your hair, then gather the bottom half of your hair and grab it all with that same hand again. Then secure with an elastic as usual. I got it on my first try, have used it three times since and it's been a one-hit-wonder each time.

I have never really took care of myself because of how severely depressed I was (still am a little). In my mind it was always 'Why bother with make up/working out/eating well when I'm going to be ugly no matter what?' I have finally found a therapist that I really enjoy working with, though, so my life has started to turn around.

What I'm looking for here is baby steps so I don't feel so overwhelmed by everything. For instance, with the eating well part I have cut out soda and replaced all my snack foods with fruits and veggies. For working out I use the stationary bike just a little every day. I'm not jumping into p90x or whatever it's called.

I have zero idea when it comes to a beauty routine. The most I know how to do is shave. I guess I'm looking for basic things that I can build off. I know I must sound incredibly vague but I really have no idea about typical morning routines and what not women do. I am looking for steps that increment weekly, I think, just to get in the habit. Anything with having to do with hair, makeup, lotions, and the like would really help me out.

1358402738.0,101,self.TheGirlSurvivalGuide,16ql6x,Mix coconut oil into your shampoo for super soft hair!  The shampoo helps the coconut oil penetrate your hair better.  ,peekoooz,117,16,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/16ql6x/mix_coconut_oil_into_your_shampoo_for_super_soft/,"EDIT:  If anyone tries this, I'd love to hear how it works for other people.

I've posted this in countless comments in various subreddits and people always seem intrigued by it, so I thought I'd just make a post where more people would be likely to see it.

This is the best tip I've ever gotten for my hair.  It will be most helpful for people with dry hair, curly hair, or afro-textured hair.  People with fine, limp hair should proceed with caution, but it may be worth a try.  For anyone who already has coconut oil, I highly recommend trying it at least once because it certainly won't hurt your hair.


TL;DR - I mix it into my shampoo. 

I mix melted coconut oil (it may already be liquid in your climate) into my shampoo with about 1 part coconut oil to 3-6 parts shampoo. I started with more, then decreased it. I actually mix it about 1:2, and then add more shampoo to my scalp while I'm in the shower if my roots need more cleaning power.  If you have fine hair and want to try this, just use much less coconut oil, maybe like 1:10 or less.  Just adjust it to whatever is appropriate for your hair, which may vary some over time.

It sounds a little complicated, but it's pretty intuitive. If you don't overload on the oil, your hair will not be greasy *at all*, it will feel clean, but not stripped. If you use way too much, it will be greasy. You may not even need conditioner anymore, but I use it because it makes my hair easier to comb. I just use Vo5 or Tresemme Naturals.  You should only need a light conditioner if anything. 

For the shampoo in the mix, I use Suave daily clarifying shampoo.  I think you're probably better off with a shampoo that doesn't have a ton of ingredients like silicones or other things that may cause buildup.  I have not tried this with sulfate free shampoo (which is what I used before this), so I don't know if it would work better or worse.

I microwave the oil to melt it, then put it in a squeeze bottle with shampoo and shake it up. It separates quite a bit, but I just shake it back up in the shower. For whatever reason, the mixture is more liquidy than shampoo alone, even though the coconut oil started as a solid, so I squeeze it directly onto my hair with the squeeze bottle because that's easier.




This is by no means ""scientific,"" but what I've read is that, in theory, shampoo lifts the scales of the cuticle while it's on your hair. Coconut oil is one of few oils that can truly penetrate your hair, as opposed to coating it, I believe because it has shorter fatty acid chains. By mixing the coconut oil into the shampoo, the coconut oil is able to penetrate more effectively while the cuticle is already open. I can't tell you if any of that is actually true, but it makes some sense (if anyone has some legitimate science here, I would love to hear it). Another way to really get the coconut oil into your hair is to do a hot oil treatment with it because heat will also help it penetrate.  

What I can tell you for sure is it improved my hair by leaps and bounds.  So, that's how I use it. Applying it like a serum or doing hot oil treatments are the other options for using it, but I don't feel the need to do those.


My hair is wavy, medium (as in not coarse, but not fine either), and very thick. I am 3/4 caucasian and 1/4 Japanese. Here are some before and after pictures.

[This was my hair before](http://imgur.com/a/UvQCV) Unfortunately I don't have many pictures because my external hard drive with all my pictures crapped its pants last year. The first 2 are straightened (with a GHD straightener), 3rd is air dried with mousse.

*Additional details about my hair:* My hair wasn't terrible to begin with. It always looked good when I styled it, but if I let my hair air dry it was frizzy and not nice. It also took like 6-8 hours to air dry (which was pretty unreasonable), and now it only takes 1-3 (that part I can't really explain. I guess maybe my hair absorbs less water because it's less porous), so that's a huge bonus! Also, even when my hair looked fine, it never felt nice. It was not soft at all, now it is incredibly soft. And those pictures of my hair now are air-dried, not styled. That's the best part. My hair looks great without me having to do ANYTHING to it. No styling products, no heat, nothing. And that also means I'm doing less damage to my hair, so that helps even more!


I hope this is useful for some of you :)

I'm sorry if the title is really bad, and if this post makes no sense. I have no idea how to ask for advice but I feel a little overwhelmed right now.

 I'm 17 (18 on August sixth) and leaving for college in less than a month. I really want some advice, but all the threads geared toward college freshmen in /r/AskReddit and the like are more about how to stay on top of classes, how to make friends, etc. But I really want to know how to do the girly things, too...like, how do I shave without hogging the shower? I can easily take an extra 15-20 minutes if I shave under my arms, my leg, my bikini line. And what if I clog the drains with my hair? And how do I poop in public?! 

I'm rooming with one of my best friends from high school, so we'll be making this journey together. But I'm also afraid that this year will make or break our friendship as it's been rocky for a while now. 

I was raised kind of sheltered. I don't even know how to take loans out on my own and my mom refused to let me sit with her when she filled them out, even though I'll be paying it back after graduation. She never taught me basic things and most of it I learned alone, like when I convinced her to let me do my own laundry. I took a financial management class in my junior year (and an accounting class in senior yr) but a couple chapters in a HS level course won't really prepare me the way a parent is able to. 

It doesn't take me long to pick up on things so hopefully I won't be lost for too long once I'm there, but I'm going to be three hours away from my sister, friends, and boyfriend (of 2+ years, who is already in college and has helped me with things when I ask.) I'm so scared I'll feel alone or like I have no female person to look to for advice. 

I'm still looking more for the hygiene aspect of this - shaving, showering, general upkeep and everything, but any advice is welcome. Please and thank you :)

This discovery has changed the entire game. Coconut oil smells great, isn't messy because it's solid at room temperature, and feels soooo good. I orgasmed ... multiple times. After once, the room usually starts smelling pretty strongly of sex. Not this time. The coconut oil completely masked the scent and the really nice smell actually enhanced the experience. It doesn't get sticky or dry like other lubes, and it didn't wash off too much with... my rather enthusiastic efforts.

1358442728.0,89,self.TheGirlSurvivalGuide,16rdg5,Epilator info!!! Aka- I'M SO HAPPY I BOUGHT ONE!,chouffee,107,18,83,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/16rdg5/epilator_info_aka_im_so_happy_i_bought_one/,"Ladies- I've been reading a lot about epilators recently. Hair removal is important to most of us. However, hair growth can be a source of pain and embarrassment for some of us.

My legs and arms are not hairy at all. But- my armpits and bikini/pubic area is a disaster. Honestly, I shave and it looks like I don't. The area of hair growth under my arms is a section larger than most men I know, going down to my side boob and up to at least 2 inches under my actual arm. The hairs are coarse and black and even after shaving, I have 5:00 shadow. You can see every single hair under the skin and it looks like I didn't even bother. When I was younger, two guys I know actually asked me if I ""even bothered shaving?""- yes, I know it's rude, but it did happen and I've been embarrassed since. But I digress....  My bikini line is just as bad, but maybe worse because of the red, swollen bumps that appear after shaving. I have to wear shorts when I go swimming in the summer to a friend's pool or at the beach. And the bikini line hair goes to my thigh, also coarse and black. 

I used to wax my underarms and my bikini line, but awaiting the hair to grow is unpleasant and embarrassing. It usually takes people two weeks or longer, takes me less than 2 weeks, but since it grows at different rates, a wax grows in within a week of having it done. Also, I can no longer get brazilian waxes because I actually have 3 hairs growin out of one follicle in certain areas and by the time the wax is over, I'm so swollen I can't sit or walk. The swelling lasts for days. Pretty much pointless for ""gettin' some"" after the wax since nothing can go anywhere near my bits.

So- I've read up about epilators. Bought one yesterday (Remington) and just used it on my armpits and bikini area. The hair growth was only 5 days old. (I shaved on Saturday night)

Yeah- it hurt like a bitch- but only for a few seconds on each area. The entire time I did it, I was watching the hairs disappear and the pain went away. It was as if my brain said, ""Fuck that pain, look how pretty and easy this is!)

So, if you girls are interested in buying one, especially girls who share the same awful hair problems as I do, I highly recommend it. The pain is only for a few seconds, but that's how long it takes to remove the hair. Like a wax, once it's done, the pain is done and the area is smooth and pretty. I wish I would've known about this sooner. I've only ever felt confident the first time I'm waxed for the season, but the hair grows back quickly and since the hair I have grows way far down, I can't wait for another wax in the summer. I only get one a year. This epilator can be used as soon as the hair grows in and I'm stoked. 

**TL;DR**  Buy and epilator if you have thick, coarse, black hair that grows whenever and wherever it wants. DO IT!!!

**EDIT**  This is the one I purchased: [Remington](http://www.amazon.com/Remington-EP6025-Recharegeable-Epilator-Attachment/dp/B003H6FPVI/ref=sr_1_1?s=hpc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1358453191&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=epilators)

**EDIT 2**  Wow! I bought mine at Target for $60, but I linked this one on Amazon which *WAS* $55 and is now $50. So not fair, but whatever! I had no patience for shipping. Damn.

ADD-ON- for whatever I add on, because I talk a lot.

I know I'm not fat and I know I'm a decent human being. I know that he didn't mean it to make me feel bad about myself... Yet I've been feeling self conscious for days afterward. Any tips on how to better my outlook on myself? I'm trying to not be so sensitive about my body (which is at a healthy weight, I work out, etc) because there is nothing wrong with it. But I can't seem to shake off negative comments. I even have a rule that I can't look at myself in the mirror without finding something I like (a rule I adopted while in therapy).

After pretty much pouring out the contents of my purse onto the bathroom floor hoping to find a tampon, it hit me- I switched purses this morning.  In a rush I only grabbed my wallet and my phone and threw them into a purse I hadn't used in a few months. I hadn't expected to get my period that day so I didn't think about it before leaving the house.

So my advice? Keep at least one of each item you might need unexpectedly, at all times in every purse.  Easy small things like tampons, pads, chapstick, pens and a stick of gum are cheap and easy enough to keep in your purses so that you'll always have one on hand even if you need to make a quick purse switch before leaving your house for the day! 

What are some other things you girls suggest always keeping in your purse?

2. Aztec Healing Clay - Again cliche, but for a good reason. Whenever I feel like my skin needs a really good deep clean this is my go to. It gets rid of clogged pores in just one use and feels amazing.

3. Maybelline's Line Stilleto Liquid Liner - This is by far my favorite liner, and I've tried a ton, both high end and low end. I love that it can make me look put together in a second for day with just some bronzer, or super dramatic for night with a bold lip.

Mine manifests maybe three times a year, usually due to diet or stress. With these tips, my cold sores usually only last four days. 

In 1981, Christopher Kagan, M.D. discovered that if he isolated herpes viruses in a petri dish, and added the amino acid arginine, the viruses would multiply. However, when he added another amino acid, lysine, the virus's ability to multiply was inhibited. According to Kagan, Lysine blocks the bioavailability of arginine, to prevent the virus from replicating.

I usually treat with Abreva and try to up the l-lysine in my diet. L-Lysine is an essential amino acid and is often included in many cold sore treatments, but is also contained in many foods.  

Foods high in lysine, low in Arginine:
**margarine,
yogurt,
most cheese and dairy,
fish(especially flounder),
most poultry and meats,
mangoes, apples, pears and other fruits**

Studies show that people who have contracted herpes simplex and have a diet high in Arginine tend to have more outbreaks. When you feel the tingling and itching in your normal spot, avoid Arginine like the plague! 

Therefore, DO NOT eat these foods if you're experiencing a cold sore:
**most nuts,
Most seeds,
Grains,
Jello,
Chocolate**


[this resource](http://www.traditionaloven.com/tutorials/l-lysine_rich_foods.html) is great if you're unsure how much lysine and Arginine are in the foods you're eating. Some experts also recommend upping your vitamin C and E intake during an outbreak to help aid health and healing.

During an outbreak, it is critical to remember that you are HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS. If you're unsure whether you're contagious or not, err on the side of caution. Do not touch your outbreak, wash your hands often, and don't share makeup, drinks, utensils, or food. For instance, I contracted the virus when a friend of mine was using my lip balm and didn't tell me she was healing from a cold sore. Shit sucks like that! 

Other options for treatment are prescription topicals provided by your doctor. But remember, there is no cure for cold sores. Keep trying to eat right constantly and keep stress out of your life. Stress weakens the immune system and can let the virus loose! You will always get them at some point in your life, but with careful monitoring you can minimize your outbreak.

I love using outbreaks as a time to rock a bold lip. Lots of bright red lipstick! It helps hide the redness of the cold sore and I get compliments left and right. People don't even notice I have a cold sore!

1. First of all, try not to wash your hair more than once every two days (I know this isn't easy for everyone). Washing too often will dry out your hair. From time to time you can even skip a washing if you don't have any plans to go out. Letting your natural oils sit in your hair for a day can make your hair extra soft the next time you wash it.
2. For longer hair, keep a clip or hairband in the shower. This way you can keep your hair up after conditioning it so you don't accidentally rinse some out. On this note I also wash and condition my hair at the beginning of the shower, then proceed to wash the rest of me so the conditioner can sink in as long as possible.
3. Rinse the conditioner out of your hair with cool or cold water. Heat can be pretty damaging, just like with straighteners, curling irons, or blow dryers.
4. Try not to brush your hair when it's wet. It's really soft when wet and is more likely to break when pulled at and brushed. If you really want to, use a wide-toothed comb instead. Even when dry, though, try not to brush your hair too often.
5. When drying your hair, do not rub your hair vigorously with the towel. As in flipping your hair over your head and rubbing your towel all around as if starting a fire. Try not to start a fire in your hair. Instead, flip your hair over your head and wrap the towel around your hair, twist it up and let it sit on top of your head for about 5 min.
6. Leave-in conditioners. Especially when your hair is still damp. Then (if you want to use a comb) use the comb to spread the leave-in conditioner through your hair.
7. If you put your hair up in ponytails frequently, try moving the placement of the ponytail from time to time. The hairband can break your hair if it's really tight and in the same place all the time.
8. Finally, try to keep your hair out of the sun (we're back to that heat is damaging thing again). This last one is some advice that I got after getting it dyed a while ago, but that I personally don't follow now that I'm back to my natural color. I can't stay out of the sun in the summer, and I personally love the natural highlights I get from it.

The [website.](http://www.girlfriendsocial.com)

I see a lot of posts on Reddit asking other people how to meet and make friends as an adult because, let's be honest, making new friends after high school or college becomes pretty difficult. And it becomes even more difficult if you have recently moved. 

Background: I graduated college a few years ago, and then moved to a new city. A huge majority (like 99%) of my colleagues are significantly older than I am. The remaining 1% either work in other units and I do not get much interaction with them, or it became very obvious early on that being friends was not an option.

One day, I got fed up with being bored and lonely (my boyfriend and I work opposite schedules, unfortunately) and decided that I was going to meet some new people, dammit, no matter how awkward and forced it might be. I began thinking, ""There are a bunch of dating websites, there has to be friend websites!""

So, I googled it. I literally typed ""friendship website"" into the browser. I am not sure why I had never thought of it before. 

I found [this](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/18/online-friends-more-women-dating-websites-female-friendship_n_1684163.html) website, where it mentions Girlfriend Social. I decided to give it a try since an actual news org had decided to look into and found it to be not sketchy. 

I signed up, made an account, and starting using the website's search and match features. And for a long while, I didn't get very many results.

However, just a month ago, I found 3 lovely ladies who were in my area and also looking for friendship. We all had reasons why we didn't have many friends (one just got back from Afghanistan, another works from home, a third just moved to town). I have met two of the women (one lady and I have some great compatibility - seriously - your dissertation uses STS methodologies *and* you also powerlift?! Amazing!) and I will meet the 3rd this weekend. 

Now, to the actual Pros and Cons

**Pros**

* Super easy to use

* Allows you to list your actual city

* Fast search

* Has pre-formatted hobbies so you don't have to think too hard

* Everyone has been super nice so far

**Cons**

* Doesn't allow for much creativity in describing yourself

* I hate writing taglines

* The people on the site don't have very good estimations of distances - We may live on the same side of the state, but I am not on this website to make friends with people 2.5 hours away

* Not a bunch of traffic, so it took a long time and there may not be a lot of women in your area

* First meet-ups still feel a little like first dates

* While you can list your actual city, the search algorithm is by the closest major city to you. Also, I do not know what they define as major. I live in my state's capital and it was not listed.

Anyway, those are my thoughts. I highly recommend the site if you feel like you could add to your social life, as there really isn't much lose! I have recommend this site to a few people through my blog and other women have also found new people to meet!

My concern is cleaning the thing. I'd have to do it in front of everyone! We also share a kitchen, and I think boiling it would just be plain weird for everyone...

They are small enough, but I can't seem to get them clean and stay clean. If you ladies have any good routines, recipes, or products you swear by please let me know! I'd appreciate the help.

I am among many of you as a sufferer of KP, also dry and very fragile, fair skin. Here are a few of my personal favorite tips:

* Cold, cool, or lukewarm showers are the best; they don't dry out your skin and actually can leave it refreshed. Also, this is great for your hair to make it shiny and silky.

* Don't shower everyday. If you must, then don't use soap on anything but the important stuff; it'll dry your skin out and will hinder the build up of natural skin oils essential for healthy skin.

* If you wear makeup, WASH IT OFF EVERY NIGHT. No exceptions to this one.

* Instead of lotion, I use liquid coconut oil to moisturize after a shower. It has helped my KP more than any dermatologist, keeps it silky smooth and touchable, moisturizes like mad, and leaves a light sweet scent. If you can't find coconut oil, look for tubs of Eucerin. It is sent from the skin gods, though expensive.

* For a face scrub since I have dry skin, I mix raw sugar with coconut oil and a bit of honey. Rinse and pat dry with a clean towel. I don't know if I'd suggest this for someone with oily skin, though.

* I use hypo-allergenic everything- from laundry detergent to body wash. I like to think this helps keep my skin clear, though probably not.

* Something a lot of people don't do because of the extra time it takes is PAT DRY with a dry towel after you step out of the shower. Rubbing can scrape your skin in ways it shouldn't be. 

* Within 3 minutes of patting dry, apply moisturizer all over. The moisturizer locks in the water on the outer layers of your skin; it doesn't normally put more in. After about three minutes, all that good ole' H2O evaporates.

* Don't load up on fatty foods; even my dry skin hated it when I tried the lo carb diet. I've never had so many zits before. Thus, I stay away from these kinds of food for my skins sake.

* Drink lots of water. And wear a light sunscreen at all times. I cover my skin as best I can when possible. When I can't or don't want to, there is always a good sunscreen nearby.

That's about all I can think of at the moment. Sorry these aren't 'tricks' per se, but timing and good habits.

I tried to draw what it looks like in Paint, but I'm not sure if you guys will, like, understand it. Someone in the other thread asked if it looked like cauliflower, and I guess that's it.

On some of the websites I read, people said that the hymen just might be thick and you have to try and open it to get through. I was still confused, but when I touched and looked at the thing through a mirror, it doesn't, I guess the word would be open. It's not penetrable, it's just a layer over across.



It would take me a bit to gather some courage, but after I do, I want to talk to my mom about getting the surgery or whatever to fix it if it's a septate hymen.

Do I go to my regular doctor? I have to go there soon anyway to get some warts removed. Do I just casually mention it? ""Oh, yeah, by the way Doc, do you think you could look at my hymen? I think it might be septate, and I can't get a tampon in."" Would I have to go to a hospital for surgery?

1. Weight Loss

2. Alcohol Tolerance

3. Smelling like Maple Syrup


Things to consider: 
dose type (seeds vs extract, etc)
dose amount/frequency
duration of dose

EDIT 2: Ok, the next step is to choose a dosage type: seeds, vs extract, etc. As the inspiration for this experiment took [Solaray](http://www.thenaturalonline.com/solaray-fenugreek-organically-grown-100-veggie-caps.html), that seems like a good start.

I've had my period since I was 13, so that's 7 years. Within the last 8 months, every second period has become incredibly painful, regardless of whether it is heavy or light. I'm not talking, oh my tummy hurts, I'm talking on floor unable to move for the pain.

The first time I went to the doctors, they essentially brushed me off saying I needed to take an STD test. (This time was during endometriosis awareness week as well *sigh*)

The second time, different doctor, she just said I needed to take painkillers and prescribed me with a lot of ibuprofen, which I was already taking when I had the cramps, telling me to take two every day from the day my period starts, regardless of whether it hurts or not.. I am quite sensitive to pain killers, if I have a headache, I usually only need one standard panadol to kill it. The day before that meeting I had had my first cervical swab and threw in an STD test as well, even though I was not worried about any STDs as my only partner has been my current boyfriend and I've been his only, both of which have come back clear normal which is great.

Basically I just feel like there could potentially be something deeper, but am just being brushed off as a wimp and a slut.

Also, tell me I'm not the only one who has been told since the beginning that if your period impacts your normal life to see a doctor?

I understand that they're are many occurrences where medicine/antibiotics are required but if there's a way I can take care of it myself, hallelujah! This is where I discovered alka seltzer. It tastes absolutely horrendous, but 2 tablets dissolved in water morning and at night for 3 days with TONS of water ( like you should with any bladder infection)  will completely alleviate any pain, allowing your body to fight off the infection by itself like its designed to do. As soon as i have my first glass any pain while urinating is gone within the hour. The alka seltzer neutralizes the pH in your urine, which stops that 'burning' feeling.

1353160591.0,65,self.TheGirlSurvivalGuide,13cn5o,[TIP] Skincare ultimate guide! I'll share mine if you share yours. Warning: wall of text.,spacemermaid,75,10,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/13cn5o/tip_skincare_ultimate_guide_ill_share_mine_if_you/,"To all the acne/skin issues sufferers, let's share notes!  
(about me: I have fairly sensitive, ""congested"" skin with hormonal triggered acne, and these are the things I wish I knew sooner).
  
1. If you can have insurance/can afford it, SEE A DERMATOLOGIST.  These people actually know what they are talking about, can provide you with samples of medicines, prescriptions and knowledge about what will make your skin healthy! Additionally, if you think your acne is more hormonal, see your regular doctor and potentially an endocrinologist.  A lot of the time, skin issues are more than just surface problems.   

2. When it comes to skincare, less is more.  If you are going to use some sort of medicated treatment on your face on a daily basis, you probably want to use the most gentle face wash possible.  Some suggestions include: Aquanil, Cetaphil, Purpose.  Basically, you don't want to be irritating your face with extra nonsense if you are going to be medicating it otherwise.  It took me forever to realize that I was making my skin way worse by adding on more stuff to my skincare routine.  Pare back your routine to the bare minimum of things that work, and then DON'T CHANGE IT unless it stops working!     

3. Get rid of alcohol based toners.  Seriously, toners seem awesome, they make your face tingle, but they also make your face WAY more greasy, so you think you need more toner.  You do not need toner!  I have heard that alcohol-free witch hazel is nice to use, but haven't tried it myself.  

4.  If you have a lot of facial hair, plucking can be a dangerous thing - you are essentially opening a tiny hole in your face to let in bacteria, which can and will cause acne.  Make sure you are either cleaning thoroughly, or try an alternate method for hair removal like laser (warning: expensive!).  

5. Sunscreen/moisturizer!  Definitely get a good, basic moisturizer with sunscreen in it.  Use it everyday!

6.  Eye makeup removal: Use oil!  You can use one or a combination of olive oil, grapeseed oil, jojoba oil, sweet almond oil, coconut oil and other similar oils with a q-tip or cotton ball, and use it to swab off eye makeup.  It works wonderfully and has the benefit of being really good for moisturizing the skin around your eyes.  

7.  Allergies.  It took me a really long time to realize that I was having skin issues because I was allergic to certain ingredients in skin products.  Sometimes you never can figure out what is irritating you, but sometimes it's obvious - for me, it's soy based ingredients and the rest is a mystery.  This goes back to the less is more theory - if things seem to be getting worse, cut back on products and start over to try to figure it out.  Also, it is possible that food allergies can trigger acne.    Dairy and wheat/gluten are pretty common offenders, and I know that vitamins with fish oil or DHAs make me breakout immediately.     

8. Exfoliation.  Depending on what treatment you may or may not be using, exfoliation is great!  If you are using retinoids or benzoyl peroxides, or whatever else, you may want to be careful with over exfoliating, since these chemicals will cause exfoliation on their own.  If you don't use those types of chemicals, physical exfoliation is a great way to slough off dead skin and keep your pores clean and clear.  You hear awesome stuff about the Clarisonic (a spinning brush thing), but that is expensive! There are a million cheap knockoffs of it that will do pretty much the same thing.  I have the Olay version of this and I love it!  A more low tech and even cheaper way to exfoliate is with a [Buf Puf](http://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/3M/en_US/Buf-Puf/Home/).    

9.  The Heavy Hitters!! Note that many of these products can make your skin itchy/dry for maybe up to a week when you first start using them, but it's often worth it!  Let's discuss the various treatments and what they do for skin:  

* AHA - alpha hydroxy acid.  Well-known AHAs include lactic acid, glycolic acid, malic acid and citric acid. They are water-soluble and are really good at exfoliating damaged, dry skin.  They unclogs pores, and actually help to moisturize your skin, plus you can use them when you are pregnant.  Note that it can sting a little.  

* BHA - Beta hydroxy acid. AKA Salicylic Acid - also why crushed up aspirin helps zits (it's the same ingredient).  Similar to AHAs, but BHAs are better able to penetrate oily, blemished skin and pores.  Note that you should not use this during pregnancy!  

* Benzoyl Peroxide - Benzoyl peroxide works as a peeling agent. It increases skin turnover, clearing pores and reducing the bacterial count (specifically P. acnes) as well as acting directly as an antimicrobial.  Will bleach fabrics, so pillows beware!  This is often used VERY effectively in conjunction with other treatments, like salicylic acid or with retinoids.  Note that you should probably not use this during pregnancy, but some doctors say it is ok.  

* Retinoids - These are chemical compounds based on vitamin A. There are three ""generations"" of them, so you get the first generation retinoids: which include retinol, retinal, tretinoin (retinoic acid, Retin-A), isotretinoin, and alitretinoin; the second generation retinoids: which include etretinate and its metabolite acitretin; and finally the third generation retinoids: which include tazarotene, bexarotene and Adapalene.  These guys speed up cell turnover and strip the top layer off your face, making you look glowy and lovely and zit and wrinkle free. Love this stuff!  You can't use this when you are pregnant.  

* Oral antibiotics.  There are a million different versions of these, and they can be magical, but they aren't great because your body will start to build immunity to them, and that's not good.  I guess certain types of acne are more about the infection under the skin rather than what is going on at the the surface, so these fight acne from the inside.  If you have a special event for which you NEED a perfect face, see the dermatologist and ask for these!  I don't think they are great for long term use, but they can really knock down a bad skin condition and give you a good starting point for other treatments.  Can't be used during pregnancy!

There are probably more, but these are the main methods you usually get with the professionals.  Note that I mentioned the pregnancy stuff.  This is mostly due to the fact that I am pregnant and had to recently readjust my whole skincare routine because I can't use my precious epiduo (combo of benzoyl peroxide and adapalene), which is really what spurred this whole post.  

In conclusion, dealing with problem skin sucks, so hopefully this is helpful to someone out there!  Please everyone feel free to add and correct!!

Some people suggested I get one of those SAD lamp thingies, which are way too expensive, but someone else suggested just taking vitamin D supplements.

OK, I had to somewhat guess on a size for this bridesmaid's dress. Turns out, I cannot fit a strapless bra in there.  I thought it was ok without, but now I'm feeling self conscious about my boobs in this thing.  

It looks ok from some angles, but from above, I feel like I'm falling out of it.  If I take a deep breath (2nd &amp; 4th pic) there's spillover.  I don't know if I should go buy the next size up (I can't return this one sadly...), or if maybe I can body tape it to me so it covers more.

Here's my personal experience!,,68,9,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/14j8di/thought_about_getting_a_clarisonic_heres_my/,"Hey everyone, I figured I'd submit a review/personal story about my experience using the Clarisonic Mia. It's a cleansing brush that claims to clean your face better than manual cleansing alone, much like electrical toothbrushes are supposedly better than manual ones. If you're not having a problem with your skin, I'd say you don't absolutely need this product, but it's a wonderful luxury regardless of skin type.

ANYWAY.

I have skin from hell. I suffered with cystic acne for years, I have eczema, I have both dry and oily patches, my pores are huge, and I'm highly sensitive to harsh temperatures and stress. Many of these problems run in my family. In fact, my aunt gets biweekly facials and is still fading pockmarks and scars from her teenage years.


Since before I was a teenager, my parents and I have literally spent hundreds of dollars on dermatologists, prescriptions, over-the-counter products, and natural remedies. I have tried many effective products and helped many others with their skin, so I know what works for many different skin types. [I'll do another post about acne remedies when I'm not so busy with finals, and will post a link here!].


Thankfully, I now break out like a ""normal"" person, or at least my interpretation of it. A few zits here and there, with a slightly worse breakout in the week before my period is due. Still annoyed with my pores, acne scars, and general unevenness of my skin, I purchased a Clarisonic Mia in the spring this year (sometime in mid-April).
- http://www.clarisonic.com/shop/sonic_skin_cleansing_systems/sonic_skin_cleansing_system_mia/index.php?sku1=100140

I recommend buying from an authorized seller or the website itself, because there is a money-back guarantee!


I started using this product very slowly. I used it once a day, every other day, for about a week, then started using it twice a day. This is very important because this brush tends to ""purge"" your skin, and can really cause a breakout at first. By easing into the use, you're minimizing the extent of this ""purge"".


You can use it with any cleanser you want, but I wouldn't recommend an abrasive scrub because the brush heads are designed to exfoliate.


This brush has accelerated the fading of my acne scars and has minimized the appearance of my pores (they're mostly clear, therefore less visible). My parents (who were going to return it if they couldn't see a difference) have raved about the product and how much nicer my skin looks. I break out less, and when I do, they breakouts are typically not cystic &amp; go away relatively quickly. My skin has more of a glow and I LOVE washing my face!


Ask away; I'll be happy to respond with any questions! Will edit if there's a popular question.


tl;dr: The Clarisonic is NOT a gimmick. While your results may vary (nothing works for everyone) it's worth a shot if you can afford it!

I'm part looking for advice and part looking to let off some fear-steam.  

So apparently my body SUCKS at periods (or it really, really wants me to have babies) because it's been accumulating endometrial tissue.  During my period, about half of that excess is eliminated, and the rest just builds up during the cycle.  I'm pretty sure it's doing that because of a hormonal imbalance, because I also have a thyroid condition, but my Gyn wants to biopsy it just in case (he suspects it might be a polyp).  After he takes samples for the biopsy, he's going to remove it with god knows what instrument.

All of this is going to require spinal anesthesia, which is the part that scares me the most.  I'd like to know about experiences some of you may have had with similar procedures.  Can you feel the needle going into your spine?  I mean how do they even hold my legs in position if they're numb?  Will I pee myself in front of everyone in the Operating Room like some pregnant women do?  I understand I will be given a choice to stay awake, be mildly sedated or be asleep.  Which one would be best?

Thank you!

EDIT: I am home! It wasn't half bad. Didn't even notice the spinal, they sedated me before putting it in. The worst part was waiting until around 1:00 pm while fasting, to be moved to the OR.

My experience with the Tanda Zap has been incredible.  The tool functions by battery (included with the one I bought).  You press the button and it vibrates and lets out a blue LED light.  You lightly press it on the culprit and the tool automatically turns off after two minutes.

You can use this thing on a zit 2-3 times a day.  I have found that it causes the zit to come to the surface after just one day.  After each treatment I gently wipe that bad boy with toner on a cotton pad and the thing just pops itself!  The zit completely flattens out and is gone in one to two days!

You can easily clean the tool with a cotton ball and rubbing alcohol.  I clean it every time right before I use it.  You get 1000 treatments out of one tool. 

This thing is fucking amazing and I highly recommend it!

I get my hair trimmed every 4-8 weeks. 

Over the past 6 months or so I've had a heck of a time with split ends. I was trying to grow my hair out (was at shoulders, trying to grow to mid back) but the split ends seemed to get worse the longer it grew so I got it cut back to my shoulders. 

Any tips to keep the split ends away? My diet hasn't changed, my routine didn't change, just the length of my hair. Could that be the cause of it?  

**Edit:** Thanks for all of the tips! I'll give them all a shot, hopefully I can get the split ends under control so I can grow my hair out again! :D :D 

**Edit:** So, I went back to the hair salon for another trim (last one was twoish weeks ago and I already have split ends like crazy) and ended up getting an inch and a half taken off. I talked to the stylist and told her everything I had explained in this thread. She asked what kind of shampoo I used and yelled at me when I told her what I did use. She recommends using **V05** if I didn't want to use professional quality shampoo. V05 is like $1.25 where I shop, so I'm definitely getting some the next time I go to the store. If alcohol is one of the first three ingredients then skip that shampoo. She said to steer clear of **Herbal Essence, Aussie, TRESemme, and most of all Pantene.** So now the plan is to really start fresh, taking all of these tips and putting them to use.

My mom never showed me how to be a woman. In fact, I had such a screwed up relationship with my parents that I completely eschewed all things womanly until about a year and a half ago (I'm 26 now) - I had a serious problem with internal misogyny. As a result, my makeup/hair/fashion/decor choices were inspired by men-centric ideals.

I've found that I actually enjoy traditionally-feminine things! While I love to cook - I'm always trying new recipes - baking pretty much eludes me. After wearing makeup for several years, I still have questions about eyeshadow and blush. My fashion choices leave much to be desired - I have a professional job (office manager), but my professional and home wardrobe are seriously bad. I'm stuck with jeans and a T, because that's all I know; at work, I'm in black pants/skirts and any blouse that looks halfway decent. I've started wearing floor-length skirts in my free time - so much more comfy than jeans - but they definitely don't lend themselves to looking put-together. In short, my wardrobe looks like it belongs to someone who's just graduated high school - that's not good. 

Can anyone help me out? Especially with the home-decor thing - I've lived in my apartment for two years, and I have no clue what to put on the walls. I really like the shabby-chic look, but I'm very much into the vintage-look at well. As a result, I have way too much dark wood furniture... and nothing on the walls. 

I'm really into vintage, floral, 20s-era kind of things, mixed with bohemian-chic, retro style... but I have no idea how to do it. I'm also on a budget - I'm an office manager for a non-profit, which means I get paid crap (but I love my job, so it's a good trade-off for me).

After a while I started experimenting to make it ginger-friendly. I've been doing it for a couple years and I love it so I thought I'd share. Start off with liquid foundation that matches your skin tone the best. Apply a small dab on your chin, nose, two on the forehead and two half-dabs under the eyes. Using a dampened makeup sponge, blend in the foundation. Be sure to keep the sponge damp! The other trick I use is for powder, I always end up looking like I rolled in a bag of Cheetos with normal powder, so now I add a bit of baby powder and a dash of corn starch. Works like a charm, I can still see my freckles too!

I'll try and think/post more later, but in the mean time: What tips/tricks do you use for fair skin?

Edit: Also, I have found that a lot of skin toners/cleansers can be harsh on freckles. I actually started to see mine fade! So I switched to a regimen of Witch Hazel and Hydrogen Peroxide and for stubborn zits, the super-duper zit cream from CVS (store brand is cheap and works!). Also, this isn't necessarily a makeup tip, but henna can make red hair so dreamy! Darkens and intensifies the color without being harsh or damaging like a dye.

Edit 2: These tips are great! Another tip (maybe not for everyday use) lip liner as eye liner. Choose a red that that a bit darker than your hair color (I use one called 'Garnet') and apply a little thicker than you would normal eyeliner, then blend with a Q-tip. You'll get different results with damp/dry Q-tips.

Edit 3: For blush. I went through so many blush brands and shades and still ended up looking ridiculous. Then, my SO suggested I go running for a while, then pick out a blush that kind of goes with that. I went with River Rose by NYC.

Things that have made them worse for her are going through pregnancy and being a chronic smoker.

My sister also has spider veins but they aren't as bad as my mom's. My sister regularly stays active and stays trim.

* Wear compression socks at my job - which requires standing or sitting for long periods of time.
* Exercise regularly and eat healthy
* Elevate my legs when I can

So, my question to all you girls out there who may have suffered from or known someone who has suffered from venous insufficiency.

Now that summer's here, I don't want to be spending ages trying to tame it in the morning. I've figured out a way to get a rocking bedhead, with minimum styling  and almost zero effort.

1. Wash your hair as normal, when you've got conditioner in, comb it then rinse.
1. Don't comb after you're out of the shower! Towel dry, squeezing and scrunching the water out.
1. Spray liberally with salt spray from the ears down, and scrunch the hair with your hands.
1. Let dry.
1. Once it's dry, scrunch it again to break up any strands that have gone crusty from the salt spray.

This gives me a slight wave - which is no easy feat because of how limp and straight my hair usually is.

Someone in 2x suggested I post this here. 

I've been having major success with [Dr. Mist](http://www.drmist.us/) deodorant. I got it at the health food store (in Canada), but you can also order it on Amazon. The reviews are pretty impressive, with the majority being 5-star.

I work at a hot ass dry cleaner and am surrounded by irons, steam tunnels. pressing machines, etc. It gets HOT in there. I was getting itchy, red armpits from my anti-perspirant (Dove Original), which I've been using since forever. Dr. suggested I switch to a natural deodorant without alcohol. I've tried many and been disappointed or reacted to them.

Dr. Mist is dead sea minerals, potassium, and magnesium salts. I chose the lavender version so it also contained essential oil. The water evaporates, leaving the salts, which neutralize the bacteria. There's also a fragrance-free option. It sprays on like water, you rub it in, and it takes a minute or two to dry (kind of annoying, but I'll deal).

The results? After working hard and sweating all day, I did have some wetness (normal with my anti-perspirant, even) but NO ODOUR. On the weekend, when I was just running errands and hanging out, I had no wetness and no odour. 

In Canada, you can get it at London Drugs, Superstore, or health food stores. In the States, I think you have to order it online through the website or Amazon. I paid $8 CAD. A bit hefty, but worth it IMO.

Anyway, just wanted to share because I've been looking for something like this FOREVER.

If you've tried it or have another natural deo you like, I'd love to hear your reviews.

I can put my hair in a low ponytail so my side part is kept in position, but it doesn't feel like my hair is truly out of my way then because I can still feel it at the back of my neck.

They were supposed to be a Christmas present for someone but when she left the store, she found that the cashier had forgotten to remove the security device from them. Because the store was out of her way, she just kept them in a drawer, until tonight when she asked if I knew how to get the security tag off. I told her I could try.

So...I went directly to Google! First I tried this method:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc5IbE1FZiE&amp;feature=youtu.be

With zero success. All my banging led to was a sore thumb. 

Second I tried:

http://www.ehow.com/how_7507953_remove-ink-tags-rubber-bands.html

Also no success, but many sore spots from where the rubber band broke and hit me &gt;:( I also tried a hair band but it was too thick to slide underneath the pinhead.

Finally, refusing to be defeated by a bit of plastic and a magnet, I got out a torch and held it to the back of the security tag until it melted away and exposed the inside. The plastic burned black and my bedroom still reeks of it. While it was still burning, I took a small camping knife and cut out the inside until I heard the pin pop out. You can see this method detailed here: http://www.ehow.com/how_4840510_remove-security-tags-clothing.html

Success! http://imgur.com/aeTFhKX

The moral of this story is...

***It's completely unnecessary to go through this much effort D: Just take it back to the store, explain what happened and a friendly cashier will remove it for you. I was a cashier once, mistakes happen, they'll understand. -_-***

The itchiness is not outside of the vagina, but in and around my vagina. According to [this](http://encyclopedia.lubopitko-bg.com/images/External%20parts%20of%20the%20female%20reproductive%20system.jpg) picture the itchiness is around the hymen.

* I'm 18 years old

* I've never had sex

* I've never had a UTI or a yeast infection

If the bra fits it would be great to hear from you too! I'm trying to gather information for both good fits and bad fits. I'm hoping that by gathering this data it will be easier for others to figure out what size they would need in a backless bra and to figure out the range of bra sizes that they fit.

I'm turning 18 this year and have been with my boyfriend since Christmas of this year. We've been fairly intimate fairly quickly, and some questions of mine have come up and I would appreciate any advice you could give me!

1.   I'm a virgin, and he's not. In fact, he was the first person I kissed - and he knows that I'm extremely inexperienced.  He understands, and is supportive of me as I'm learning, but I still feel like I'm ""letting him down"", so to speak.  It got to the point that I was almost in tears today because I felt so bad about it.  This is not to say that he's making me feel bad about it, but I'm beating myself up about it - how can I make myself feel more comfortable about these things? 


1b.  He has a significant amount of experience in ""that area"", and it bothers me - I know it shouldn't bother me, it's ""normal"" today, but it does.  How can I get over this, apart from discussing this with him?



2.  I started shaving ""down there"" recently, and I've gotten a few ingrown hairs.  I've read a few threads on here from you ladies and so far I've come to the conclusion that I need to invest in a good exfoliator and some coconut oil - any recommendations that I could get at a local drug store?



3.  I don't plan on having sex any time soon, but I would like to start taking birth control, just in case.  How do I go about bringing this up with my mother (I would go straight to my doctor, but I am not comfortable with my doctor and my mother knows this)?  Are there different forms? What changes should I expect, body-wise?



4.  How do I get over jealousy?! This is sort of related to the experience-idea, but its more deep-seated.  We see each other very seldom, as we both work almost every day all evening and do not attend the same school.  We talk and text as often as we can, but we still miss each other and I get jealous that he can spend all day with the same small group of people, many of whom are girls.  I know this is just me, but I want to get over this!



I'm so sorry for this huge wall and newbie questions, but I genuinely did not know where to turn!

I really didn't think I was ever going to stop biting. What works best for me is keeping them shaped and polished. The more time I spend on actually doing my nails the better (and also how good they look when I am finished), because then I remember how much time I spent/how good they look... and why would I want to ruin that? I keep nail clippers and a file with me at all times so if I get a chip or crack I take care of it with those instead of biting. Now that I am weeks in, I also look at how long it took me to grow them and can't let myself turn back now. I still find myself about to bite every so often when I am at work or in the car, but those times have become fewer and fewer as the weeks have passed.

Sooo, here goes. 


I had chronic eczema growing up and have never been a fan of soap. As I got my eczema under control, I learned to love using baking soda instead of soap... I actually use it on my entire body. The key is to avoid using too much and don't rub too hard. 


If you use it in conjunction with coconut oil (or whatever you like), you will have soft well-moisturized skin. 


Just do a quick internet search on ""baking soda skin care"" and you'll find great information and 'recipes' for using baking soda. 


I just use put a 1/4 tsp baking soda in my hand after wetting my face in the shower. The key is to GENTLY massage the face. I used to do this every two days, but now I only do it twice a week. 


For the rest of my body, I use enough to cover my hand for each body part. I do this when I feel like it... maybe three or four times a week. Like everyone else in this sub, I enjoy coconut oil, but also macadamia nut oil and others (olive oil, flax oil, whatever) instead of lotions. I try to switch it up.  


Arm &amp; Hammer now sells baking soda in a [plastic container](http://www.armandhammer.com/deodorization/baking-soda/Products/arm-and-hammer-baking-soda-shaker.aspx). I just leave that in the shower. 


I know some women like to use baking soda as a shampoo. I've never tried that, but I do brush with it a couple times a month instead of using whitening gels to keep my teeth on the whiter side. It also makes a great deodorant.

I purposefully chose a permanent soft black over blue black to ensure a more natural look. Well... that failed. My boyfriend said I looked like an anime character. It was... blue black.

Anyway, it looked awful on me and I wanted it GONE. According to the internet I had two choices - shave my head or go spend a ton of money getting my hair stripped/bleached and redyed at a salon. Considering I'm trying to grow my hair out FROM shaving it, and am also poor, neither of those options would work.

I came to this subreddit and found a few comments about this hidden in various botched-dye-job threads. I wanted to make a new tip thread to make sure everyone knew this SUPER EASY MAGICAL solution existed!

**The solution:**

Basically, I went to CVS and bought a bottle of cheap vitamin C. Brought it home and crushed a whole bunch of tablets into a chunky powder. Mixed this in with shampoo, spread it generously all over my hair, wrapped a plastic bag around my head and baked brownies for an hour (this last step is not necessary). When I washed it out...my hair was back to normal! 

I made sure to condition well the next couple of washes, but I honestly haven't noticed any damage. Unfortunately I can't be that specific about the amount of vitamin C or shampoo... I probably crushed up 30-40 500mg tables and titrated it until it felt like a good combo. I have short hair, so you may need more.

I have no idea why this works. Maybe the acid breaks down the hair dye? In any case, it worked great for me and I wanted you all to know that if you done goofed up your hair by dyeing it yourself, this might help. :)",,False,self,t5_2vfzu,1367399833.0,,,True,t3_1ciu7k,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/1ciu7k/tip_removing_dark_hair_dye_with_vitamin_c/,

What, in your opinion was your most traumatic experience? 

I have two. When I was in middle school someone called me out on having a bit of a girl stache, and it mortified me. So I went home to mom and asked to use her creme bleach. She mixed the amount she normally used, and slathered it on my lip. Within five minutes my whole face was on fire. I kept telling her it burned, and she said ""That means it's working"". So I wait out the time, and wash it off. My whole upper lip was swollen, much like hives, and was still burning. Of course, mother's hindsight kicked in and she said ""You should've told me it hurt so badly!""

Second, by 16, I had moved on to waxing my lip/chin with an Avon kit at home, and had the ""bright"" idea to try it on my netherbits. So I put a bit along the bikini line, smoothed the strip on, and pulled. The strip didn't budge. I kept yanking, and when I finally got it off I ended up with a purple patch along my bikini line that has never gone away.

I read the original post that created this subreddit and thought I should share for any interested parties.  Personally, I try to stay away from store bought masks due to all the chemicals and really, if nature can do it just as well (for pretty cheap), why not?

Below is the ""recipe"" I use.  I don't measure anything out, but the consistency you want in the end is a semi-thick paste.  It'll be a little runny because of the egg whites, but it dries quickly and stays on really well.

In a medium bowl, mix the following together.

* About 1/2 cup rolled oatmeal (I use instant 'cause it's what I have in the house.  I'm sure steel cut works just as well, maybe better.  It's a great cleanser and exfoliant.)
* A healthy splash of milk (it's a calming agent)
* 1 egg white (a natural toner)
* About 1/2 tsp nutmeg (exfoliant, along with the oatmeal, plus it smells good)
* About 1 tbsp honey (moisturizer)

Apply mask to your dry face (do this over a sink, the oatmeal can get a little messy when its not dry) and leave set for at least 15 minutes.  It dried quickly, so you don't have to hang out at the sink the whole time. I've found the longer I leave it on, the better it works.  Rinse it off like any other mask and voila! Smoother, softer, fresher looking skin.

I normally do this about once or twice a month.  Makes my face feel loved!  Enjoy, ladies! :)

Today I got a full leg wax and full brazilian at a beauty salon that was recommended to me by a close friend who swears by it.
I have never had either of these services, and my only other waxing experiences have been at-home failures.

I was initially happy with the results (very little pain and the woman was lovely) and planned on returning, but now that I think back on my appointment I'm having doubts.

First of all, I read a lot about waxing before making this appointment, and almost every online source stresses the importance of using a new, disposable applicator every time the esthetician dips back into the wax. At this place, she was using a metal one and dipping back into the same pot every time. As I was leaving I noticed her placing a new pot of wax at the table, but I don't know if it was a new metal applicator or not. So it could be that every customer gets their own pot, but still, thoughts? 

Also, she left me alone in the room while I got undressed for about 5 minutes before coming in, during which time I assume she washed her hands, but she didn't use gloves. She often kept the cloth strip between her hands and my skin, but still, is this safe?

I'm kind of upset about having these doubts because the place is actually decently priced and otherwise I had a good experience. The final result was great and felt easy. I hope I'm being paranoid.

TO CONCLUDE: Can I go back to this place or is it unhygienic and unsafe?

So last week I was put under some very difficult circumstances and ended up having to have my Mirena IUD removed surgically while I was placed under general anesthesia. 

Long story short, I have a retrograde uterus/tilted cervix and my IUD got turned somehow. When they attempted to remove it manually it was so painful I blacked out. All in all, four doctors tried to pull it out while I was screaming in pain and begging them to stop. Luckily, the IUD came out fine once I was under anesthesia and they could use the hystoscope. I have a follow up next week to get some ultrasounds and a pelvic exam, just to make sure nothing was damaged.

Anyway, this will be the first time in a number of years (I'm thinking at least 10) that I haven't had some form of birth control/hormones. I'm 27 and married with one daughter who will be two next month. I have been on the patch, pill (both estrogen and progesterone), shot, ring, and IUD. I got pregnant with my daughter while religiously taking the mini-pill, and got my IUD 6 weeks after her birth (during a time where I was breastfeeding and hormonal anyway).

8 oz vitamin E cream (found at many drug stores)
15 oz shea butter
4 oz Vaseline (I used the kind with aloe)

mix the shea butter and vitamin E cream in a microwave safe bowl. Add a portion of the vaseline and microwave for a minute or two. Stir well, and if the vaseline isn't melted completely in, microwave for another minute or two. The goal is to melt the vaseline so it will mix in well, but you don't want to boil or scorch the lotion. Add the rest of the vaseline in small increments so it will mix well.

--apply generously to feet before bed. Put socks on after and go to sleep. Wake up with lovely, soft feet. Repeat nightly, or as often as you like. 
--apply to legs immediately after shaving. Awesome feels.
--use as facial moisturizer at night (a little too greasy for daytime). I was originally worried that the vaseline would be too greasy and I'd break out, but that has not been an issue, and I think my face looks much improved since I've started using this concoction.

I'd love to get birth control, but I've heard so many scary things about it. Weight gaining (honestly I'd rather live with a terrible period.. I'm in the process of losing weight, 28 lbs down so far, and gaining any would shatter my soul), face breaking out (I'm a teenager, I'm breaking out enough already), terrible mood swings, along with some (hopefully extremely exaggerated) stories of (supposed) death that, as an eighth grader, you inevitably hear in the girls bathroom.

I've heard that you stop having periods completely, I've heard that you still have them - they're just lighter, I've heard birth control is the greatest thing on the planet, I've heard it's worse than just staying on your normal period. I've heard you can take a pill, or get something inserted into your arm, along with various other things that I don't entirely understand.

So ladies, please lay it all out on the table for me. Explain like I'm five, or something.

I had posted awhile back asking about epilators and I finally got one (original post: http://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/12jpq7/anyone_have_any_recommendations_for_epilators/)!  I actually didn't get any kinds suggested to me on there, but got the one based on reviews I saw on Amazon (http://www.amazon.com/Braun-SE-7181-WD-Epilator/dp/B004TGUKG0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1352619518&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=epilator+braun).  So far I like it a lot! It doesn't come with all the attachments that the instructions have (like the underarm attachment, etc.).  It appears the attachments are in another model (7681, I have 7181 model). 

Now, I just want to describe my first time use to anyone considering getting one for the first time.  The very first time I tried it on my legs, it wasn't bad at all.  It hurt, but it wasn't anything horrible.  Now, the underarms was another story. Like I had said in some comments in the previous post, the underarms is what I have the most issues with when it comes to visibility after shaving.  So, it was the first area I wanted to tackle with the epilator.  This particular model did not come with the attachment for the underarms, but the ones that came with this one seemed to work just fine.  Because it is such a sensitive area, the first time hurt, a lot.  The best way I can describe it is that it felt like the epilator was taking the skin off.  It wasn't taking any skin off, but it hurt. With that area, I would just advise taking it slow.  I got one part of the area and then took a long break before trying again.  You just have to push through it.  Eventually I got all the area, and I was very happy with the results.  Once the redness went away, it was perfect!   I will have to provide another update on how it feels after I've epilated a few times.  I'm hoping it will hurt less.  

I haven't tackled the bikini area yet.  I am going to get the rest of my body used to it before I tackle that.  I will keep providing updates as I go. If anyone has any questions, let me know.

I've never worked two jobs before and I'm kind of worried. I'm very sensitive and need routine. My last job was a set schedule and I know with part-time jobs in retail you can be working shifts all over the place.

How should I best go about this to maximize my free time and not end up working 10 hour days at both jobs in one day or working 7 days a week? I suck at schedules. I'm thinking if one of my jobs has a set schedule, the other one can work around it.

I'm really worried the doctor is going to recommend that I throw out my bras that I wore during the past few months.

I've thought about disinfecting my bras as a compromise. Is there a way to REALLY disinfect my bras? I could use bleach on my white bras, which are luckily all cheapy Wal-Mart bras, but I can't use bleach on my more expensive, non-white bras. I've wiped down the underside of my bras with rubbing alcohol before, but I don't know if that did anything.

With my first long term relationship, by the end of the relationship the touch of the guy I dated actually made my skin crawl.  The second one, the guy did not want to have sex because of stress and we'd go months without having sex.  He was really obsessed with weight and I became really concerned it was because I wasn't fit enough.  Now I'm with this great guy and we've been together longer than the other relationships (3.5 years) and we have sex more regularly and it's always good.  But I do have phases where I just kinda don't want to do it, sometimes for a week at a time.  Like I'm just not into it, nothing to do with him but I can't get worked up.  I changed up my birth control and have been stressed, so I know that has something to do with it, but I want to make sure I'm making an effort to still feel sexual.  He's great and doesn't make me feel like I have to do it all of the time, but I'm hung up on past relationships that we had irregular sex drives and the fear that not having enough sex is an indication of something more. 


I have a terrible habit of comparing myself and my life with others.  I get nervous that my sex life is not normal and is ""dwindling"" by happy couple standards.  I know ultimately if I'm happy and we discuss these things it's fine and there is no normal in a relationship, but I don't have many close girlfriends and I don't know what other people experience.  Sometimes knowing other people's quirky relationship gives me a sense of relief and proof that there isn't a right or a wrong way to do things.


TL:DL I worry about how much sex I have in my long term relationship.  I want to just hear other stories or advice on the topic to broaden my horizons of what other people experience.

1371437823.0,36,self.TheGirlSurvivalGuide,1gholq,[QUESTION] I may have an exciting new job opportunity but it also comes with a KILLER commute. Is it worth it?,NotJaneDoe,42,6,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/1gholq/question_i_may_have_an_exciting_new_job/,"Hey ladies! I need to hear some outsider opinions about this situation because it is potentially very exciting but also a huge commitment. So naturally I'm slightly stressed. This could potentially be one of the biggest decisions I've ever made. Hahah the more I type the more I'm starting to freak out... okay here goes:


I currently live in upstate NY about 60 miles north of Manhattan. Today I was contacted about an employment opportunity in my field at an office in lower Manhattan. This is super exciting for a bunch of reasons, a few being 1) I'd be working in Manhattan and that's awesome, duh 2) they would be compensating me well 3) I'm not a college grad and this would be a great opportunity for advancement with a lot of potential doors opening. 

So here come the fears. This is WAAY out of my comfort zone. I'm an upstate girl from the 'burbs. I've never even ridden the subway alone...  yes, I'm sure I would figure it out (it's still scary though!! lol). The other drawback is if it did become something permanent for at least the first few months my commute would probably be about 2 hours each way. Which, adding in an 8 hour work day, would mean I'd be devoting 12 hours a day 5 days a week to this job. That's no joke! Like I said, they would be compensating me enough to cover the cost of my commute and put more money in my pocket at the end of the week than I make now, but I still feel like that's a huge amount of time.

So here I am. Honestly, it's something I think I want to do. There's no telling where it may lead and I think I would regret not doing it. I guess I'm just scared and looking for some encouragement. What do you guys think? If I'm offered the job should I take the leap?

UPDATE: So first off, thank you so much to everyone who replied. I love this community and really appreciate all the feedback from everyone. On a slightly more solemn note, I found out I am not being offered the position as of the current time. I was originally approached by the office manager, whom was very optimistic about bringing me on the team, but after speaking with the absentee owner of the company the owner decided he doesn't want to bring in any new people at the moment but instead focus on refining the team he has. So unfortunately that leaves me out of the equation. I was really bummed this morning (a few tears were shed) but after thinking about it I'm still glad this all happened. It has shown me how much I really want to get out there and move on to bigger things in new and exciting places. So thank you all for your kind words! I'm determined to keep on the hunt for my next move and hopefully will come across something worthwhile in the near future :) Fingers crossed!!",,False,self,t5_2vfzu,1371523325.0,,,True,t3_1gholq,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/1gholq/question_i_may_have_an_exciting_new_job/,

They were very similar to [these](http://www.drugstore.com/revlon-perfectweeze-tweezer-square-tip/qxp36933), but they had a slanted tip instead of square and the head wasn't angled.  I do know that they were Revlon, because it was printed in the metal.  I don't even know how long my grandma owned them for - I got them when she died, and the metal looked old (not tarnished or anything, but not shiny anymore).

Unfortunately, I lost them somehow (argh, still upset over that) and I've been trying to get a pair like them ever since.

I tried the exact type from that first link but the hinge part (?) got loose very quickly, and then tweezer bits won't line up which makes it virtually impossible to grasp a hair.

After that disappointment I bought a pair similar to [this](http://www.target.com/p/revlon-tweezer-compact-slant/-/A-12849952), but I found that I very strongly prefer the kind with the little finger holes.  I didn't feel like these grasped little hairs very well, either.

I would love to get a pair exactly like the ones my grandma had, but I don't even know what to search for.  I have tried looking up ""different types of tweezers"" to figure out the name for that exact kind and what I should be searching for without much luck. I've looked for Revlon tweezers, but the only ones available are ones without the finger holes or the ones I already tried that ended up being poorly made.

I'm swamped with homework and essays, and not doing as well as I should be. I can’t take care of myself (medically/physically) because I don’t have the money or the time.

You know how when you insert your diva cup or tampon, there's always a little tiny bit of blood near the exit, and it comes out later and gets in your panties?

Here are the solutions I've thought of so far:

-Wear a panty liner. For me this is inconvenient because pad type things irritate my skin. My pussy needs to breathe!

-Try to clean myself out with toilet paper before inserting the diva cup/ tampon. Better than doing nothing but i can't get all of it

-Wear underwear that I don't care about staining. Sort of a solution, but I'd still rather not stain things on purpose.

1351803097.0,29,self.TheGirlSurvivalGuide,12h6yo,I knew absolutely nothing about skincare until I became an employee at one of the nation's top medical spas. Here are some all-natural tips for pretty awesome skin.,ocarsheik,41,12,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/12h6yo/i_knew_absolutely_nothing_about_skincare_until_i/,"1. Purchase an aloe vera plant. Cut the leaves in half and use the ""mucous"" inside the plant as a facial mask. Leaves your skin bright, supple, relieves any redness/irritation and prevents dark circles or shallow under-eye areas. This has no negative side effects and can be done as frequently as you wish.

2. If your skin is oily, or if you have a lot of blackheads on your nose slice an orange in half and rub it on those areas. The acidity counteracts the oil, and leaves your skin balanced.

3. Other than acting against oil, vitamin c prevents fine lines and wrinkles. If you can find it in a serum (I use IMAGE products) it works excellently around the eyes.

4. In the morning wash your face with ONLY water. Using the chemicals in cleansers and scrubs twice daily ages you faster. Use these at night.

5. NEVER wash your face with hot water. Wash with warm, finish with as cold as possible (ice cubes work too!)

Never having worked overnight before, I have some questions for those who do/have. Bear with me!

How can I best adapt to being nocturnal? Is it like with jetlag where you just man up and power through, or is there a better way of doing it?

Do I change my eating patterns? I mean, will this help with the nocturnal thing? Like do I have 'dinner' (i.e. a meat and potatoes type meal) when I wake up and cereal before bed? Or is that not really an important thing?

It's a 7 on/7 off shift, so is that going to make it harder for me to adapt to nights? Are there things I can do on my 7 days off that can allow me to do relatively normal things (go visit friends etc) but also so I don't have to start over again in terms of waking up at night/sleeping in the morning?

So, a little while ago I posted that I had trouble getting a close shave on my legs (""Legs are smooth after shaving but... spotted? Help!""). Several fellow redditors suggested that I purchase an epilator. After doing research, I eventually got one (Remington EP6025). It arrived on Thursday. In my zeal, I opened it and went to town in my legs. It stung a little, but didn't hurt much. Then I did my underarms. Those hurt a lot more, but it wasn't a AHHHHI'MGOINGTODIE pain like I was expecting. I did my left, then my right, which was much more painful and awkward because I am right handed. Well... after I finished and it stopped bleeding, I put lotion on it (because I read that you are supposed to put lotion on after epilating) and that night and all day yesterday my right armpit was weeping a pus-like liquid (not sweat) and I could hardly lift my arm due to the painful stretching feeling. It is also very red. My left armpit is totally fine! I also foolishly decided to use the facial attachment and now have a big sore on the left side of my face!

Please help! I am obviously using my epilator wrong! I am not put off by these experiences, I just desperately need help!

(discussion about ""appropriate length"")",autumnhead,34,5,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/1e6pf0/how_to_efficiently_shave_the_hair_on_your_legs/,"Hey there, ladies! I've reads some of the threads discussing how to keep our legs smooth and hair-free, and I still have one very nagging question.    

I have tried everything from shaving (via razor), to using an epilator, to waxing my legs. I frequently use the epilator, though, as having to wait for full regrowth in order to wax can be inconvenient.     

The problem is, I am very self-conscious about the hair on my legs - if I so much as notice lots of small hairs, I won't be able to talk myself into wearing a skirt / dress or short pants, because I will have the nagging feeling that my unkempt state is very visible. Now this problem is sometimes solved by a good waxing after the hairs have grown a while but, with summer being here, I don't have the luxury to wait.     

So I have several questions:    
-  Is it a fault of the epilator that it doesn't always give a very close shave? (mine is about 4 years old, I've been meaning to replace it, but, 'till then, I have to make due with this baby)    
-  At what ""moment"" of the ""post shave growth saga"" of your leg hair are you unwilling to wear something that reveals the bare legs anymore? (and proceed to shave again)    
-  Is frequent scrubbing (i.e. once a week) any help towards getting a better shave? (I know it removes dead skin and such, and I do my best to scrub once a week, but I sincerely don't notice whether it has any impact of the quality of shaving that I get)    ",,False,self,t5_2vfzu,False,,,True,t3_1e6pf0,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/1e6pf0/how_to_efficiently_shave_the_hair_on_your_legs/,

At first, it was swollen and pimple-like, and i tried to pop it/get the hair out, but that didn't work. After I'd say a week of trying, I decided to leave it alone and let the area heal. 

The only problem is the hair is still in there. And its dark hair. And now, it seems to be deeper in. The area is no longer swollen or anything; it is completely normal except for the fact that you can now see the ingrown hair, and it's not a very defined line of ""oh, there is that pesky hair""

I was just wondering what the best method would be for removing it? I probably should've mentioned this earlier, but it is right at the lower bikini line. I also have high pain tolerance, so I'm not afraid to dig for it, I just think that isn't the smartest or safest thing to do. 

And I want to prevent this sort of thing from happening again and plan on buying an exfoliator, does anyone recommend a scrub/product that works well and wont upset my ladybits? I also get super-embarrassing butt pimples, i know-gross, and I think it is because of ingrown hairs possible, so any exfoliator I could use front AND back would be marvelous.

I'm new to this subreddit, so i apologize if this topic has been raised already.  

I've been seriously considering getting a Brazilian done, reason being that when I shave, the lady parts get a little upset with me in an unsolvable way, I've tried every possibe option as far as calming it, all to no avail.  I have one of those little bikini trimmers but it does not get everything as smooth as I'd like, therefore, Brazilian.

So here's the dealio:  

I'm a hairy chick, I have to shave my legs every two days at least to keep the spikeys away. I work in isolation for three weeks out of every month, would a Brazilian last long enough to make it worth it?  

Also, I have a little more meat on my bones than most ladies, would the extra jiggly-ness of my thighs and booty pose more of a challenge for the waxer?

So, I've recently been accepted into an international programme for high school students, and I wanted to get your advice on a few things with regards to dressing in a school context.

I'm from a country/school that's really rather judgmental and conservative -- Usually when someone puts just a little effort into how they look (like wearing a dress as opposed to jeans), people (especially girls) tend to talk a lot about that person, sometimes quite cruelly. I see the opportunity to study high school overseas -- a European country -- as a chance not only to develop myself both academically and personally, but to also finally explore the things I always want to do without fear of being criticized. 

That being said, I still find it hard to go completely IDGAF on everyone, and since I'm going to be with my new schoolmates for the rest of my high school life, I'd rather not give everyone a bad first impression of me. So, I would just like to kindly ask you guys, what would be considered ""trying too hard"" when it comes to dressing for school? In particular, I like wearing the following that would be considered ""trying to hard"" in my present school:

- Cute berets/hats, with unique features like cat ears etc
- Floral headbands (small ones though)
- Scarves in my hair
- Long, dangly, or loop earrings
- Maxi skirts/dresses
- Dresses everyday (I actually really dislike wearing pants)

I'm more confused about accessories more than anything because my present (soon ex) school has a ""no accessories, no makeup"" rule, so I have no idea what normal high schoolers in other parts of the world actually wear to school. 

Thank you so much! I really appreciate your advice in this :)

So. I bought a 3/4"" $12 ceramic iron and some hair products and watched a bunch of youtube videos and read all your wonderful comments! Here are some things I have learned about myself and hair and some questions that came up during this adventure:

* No, you cannot buy just whatever random kind of bobby pin. The kind I got doesn't work for some reason.
* Holy crap, I have a lot of hair. If you have long hair, how do you curl the top of your hair (since the iron is all wrapped up by the time you curl the bottom half of your hair)? Also, how does anyone have the patience to curl *all* of their hair? I got bored lol
* Holy crap, I have a lot of *grey* hair. It's been hiding under layers of darker hair and I never saw it until now. Oh well.
* I'm randomly ambidextrous at certain things. I am apparently left-handed at curling hair. The right side of my head is a disaster right now. Actually it looks better than the mess I expected it to be, being my first time curling. But the left side looks much better. Anyone else have this problem?
* Is it normal to have some hairs come out in the clamp? I should have brushed out all the loose ones already, right? So the loose hairs coming out onto the iron was strange.
* Are you supposed to do your hair and then your makeup, or your makeup and then your hair?
* How do you use spray hair products without getting it all over your hands/face/bathroom/things which are not the intended chunk of hair?",,False,self,t5_2vfzu,1359097539.0,,,True,t3_178t2j,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/178t2j/update_tips_for_getting_started_with_hair_stuff/,

Problem is: most girls learned this in puberty - I resisted whole-heartedly the whole way.

So, what's the best way to start to learn these things at the age of 24? I'm planning on going clothes shopping next Thursday, so I have some time to work on that (and Mom's coming with, so a bigger budget).

Okay, so as the title says, I'm moving out on my own. I'm 21 years old and will just be living with my cat as of this weekend. I went off the title of this subreddit, seems pretty open to all issue female so I thought this would be a good place to have my melt down. The apartments I'll be moving into seem pretty okay, but definitely lower income and though they're gated, the surrounding neighborhood could be better. Some of my future co-tenants seem a little questionable too. I know I'm judging a lot based off first appearances and that's stupid of me, but I'm nervous! I really like the place and it seems very quiet really. They do have a patrol at night too...
Honestly, just freaking being a girl living alone. I still get a little freaked out in the dark still. Make monsters out of shadows and use the fact that there's other people around to comfort myself and shoo away the scary thoughts.
But part of my issue is that I feel like I'm supposed to be tougher about this. I did all the work to find this place, I earn the money to pay my bills, I have been very confident about this whole thing. Also, I'm in the Army National Guard(just got back from a deployment to Afghanistan too!), I kinda feel like my friends and family expect me to not get scared and cry or anything because of that. I should be the soldier not the young girl. I should laugh off threats cause I know how to handle myself. I should be more confident in everything because I'm slightly more mature, worldly, whatever than other's my age.
So I guess I feel like I can't bother them with this, like I don't want to shatter any images. I especially don't want to give them reason to doubt me when I'm looking for courage. 
I'm not dumb, I wont be allowing random strangers inside, I'll be getting extra means of security(like, more locks or a wooden bat and/or cast iron skillet), I got all of that worked out. But I'm just worried about all of the ""what if's"" that my over imaginative mind can create. 
What if I don't like myself enough to be alone all of the time? Should I even try to make friends or stick to myself completely? I'm honestly not too agressive all that much, I can handle myself in almost any given situation, but if a dude starts creeping, I'm worried I'll take too long either recognize the slowly growing threat or that I wont know how to handle it and just try to ignore something that I should totally handle ASAP. 
I'm being very silly, I know. I'm still going to be in the same city in which I've lived for half my life, with all of my friends and family just a drive away. If I get scared, I am pretty sure I can find somebody I trust to come hang around enough for the monsters under my bed to vanish.

Thank you for reading or just existing, Reddit, I think I can sleep now...

Okay, I guess I basically just need to be calmed down about moving out on my own as a girl. I know life wont be like a sitcom and easy, but I'm also really hoping it wont be like SVU. Oh gosh....

So I've been using The Body Shop's Rainforest Balance shampoo for oily hair on and off for a while now. It used to work great (v quick transition, from feeling like i ""had"" to wash my hair at least every other day to being able to go for at least three days without a proper shampoo + conditioner deal), but now things have... changed. 

Since maybe a week or two back my hair feels very very soapy after I've showered, even though I make sure to rinse properly. I feel like it looks very greasy as well, but I'm not sure - I sometimes get to hear that I have ""shiny"" hair (in a positive sense, i guess???) but it's very difficult for me to distinct whether that is sales talk or an actual thing. Either way, with the soapy texture my  hair currently sports, it's difficult not to make the ""shiny"" = greasy connection. 

I figure that since it's pretty recent, this is a big huge flashing sign telling me to CHANGE SHAMPOO. Problem is, I don't know anything bout this type of stuff. Before I started using the one I've currently got, I only bought generic brands from the supermarket.

I'm guessing that the best and easiest way to go about it is to head to a beauty store/hairdresser's and ask for help, but I feel pretty insecure and shy about it. So in the meantime, I figured I'd ask for some guidance here. 

Anyone got similar experience/know what to do? If/when I do change shampoo, will I notice results quickly or will it take some time? Or am I just completely out of line here and the shampoo's got nothing to do with this at all? Help, please!

EDIT: Thanks so much for the replies, everyone! I calmed down a bit about it during the evening (strange how something as trivial as a slight shift in hair texture can rustle your calm so much) and decided to just ask my mum what she thought.

tl;dr I was confused and was asking questions which lovely members answered. 

I'm writing this to not only thank everyone who has given me their advice, but to inform those who want answers (just as I did).

Firstly, I had to go to my family doctor and have the Mirena prescribed.  I later picked it up from the pharmacy and brought it to the OBGYN (the doctor who places the IUD in). I was under the impression that she would be placing the IUD in that appointment, but actually gave me more information on it.  If you want to read up on it wiki (like always) does a great job http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUD_with_progestogen .  She did do a regular check up and took cultures. I also found out (and if you already know this make sure you tell your doc before the procedure)  that I have a tipped uterus.  Which can make insertion difficult if your doctor doesn't know. 
She gave me the option to have it done that day or (which she highly recommended) come back when I was on day three of my cycle and she will prescribe me a numbing agent to help with the pain.  
That's what I did.  She told me that doing it on day three of your cycle allows for easier insertion.  This is because you're already somewhat crampy (depending on the severity of your cramps.. Mine are 10/10 excruciating - just what the Mirena helps with).  Day three (also depending on your cycle) shouldn't be too heavy. 
She gave me a prescription (which I can't remember what it's called right now, but can look into it if you're interested) and placed it into the pharmacy.  The prescription was two pills that I had to insert into my vagina (as close to the cervix as possible).  *Be warned these medications typically do not come with an inserting device (thankfully I had one and cut the pills in half to insert).  You are to put the medication in the night before the procedure.  I wasn't aware that these side effects would occur (and again this may vary), but the medication made me bleed even more, numbed the top of my stomach to the middle of my thighs, and I had mild cramps.  However, I have no doubt that it helped the procedure.
The day of the procedure (today) I took four pain killers about a half an hour before going to the appointment.  The doctor told me to take as many as I did for my regular cycle cramps (again, my cramps paralyze me).  I went in and they prepare you like you were going for regular check up (clamp,etc).  The clamp and what not, doesn't hurt but it's just uncomfortable.  The doctor then measured how long my vagina was and that's where I really started to cramp.  I can't say it wasn't painful, but it was just like my regular cramps (just a bit worse) and it only lasted a few seconds.  She then inserted the IUD and I honestly didn't even notice.  I'm sure at the time I did, but it was really quick.  The whole procedure took five minutes.  The doctor left about 1cm of string to allow me to get use to it and check to make sure it stays in place.  She said if it bothered me or my SO, then just to come in and she'll cut it.  She then set up an ultrasound in a months time and I was off.
My SO drove us home (which I recommend just because I did have cramps and wouldn't have wanted to drive or take the bus). Don't get me wrong, I did and (still do) have cramps and I don't plan on moving for a bit but it wasn't that bad.

The total cost for the whole procedure was: Mirena $422.75 + Numbing agent (with insurance) $5.04 = $427.79

If you have any questions, please ask! I hope this helps you and I will keep you updated if anything changes.

I'm going to be volunteering at a monastery/retreat centre on a small Island from June-October. It's on a 60 acre farm where they grow their own food. My accommodations will be a tent and an outhouse. I forgot to ask if there was a shower, but I'm sure there is because there has been at other retreat centres I've been to.

What do I need to bring? I've gone camping before and I always bring a razor and hair gel (fine, curly hair!) and shave with a wash cloth and soap. I have a pretty strict wash, tone, serum regimen that keeps my face blemish free. I also sleep with a satin sleep cap and wear a full face of makeup every day! Do I ditch all that and just go for the basics? Should I forget about shaving my legs and pits for 4 months?

So far I'm thinking:
-face cleanser
-toner
-serum
-sunscreen
-razor
-soap
-sleep cap
-soap
-shampoo/conditioner
-gel
-argan oil
-makeup (maybe)
-comfy clothes
-blundstone boots
-sandals
-books

Am I cray cray? Should I just throw my hair up in a bun every day? 

Have any of you lovlies lived in a rustic setting before or gone camping for extended periods of time?

Any help appreciated!

- Had a big issue regulating my emotions at first (to be fair it wasn't long before I was going through a break up so that might have had something to do with it).
- There was random spotting that was difficult to predict but never a lot and never for long.
- It takes a week to get used to the thing in your arm, and if you're super skinny, you can see it. (I don't have this problem, but you can feel it under your skin if you run your fingers over it. I offer to let people touch it all the time!)

The Pros:

- After the initial mood swings, my body normalized and I don't have any issues with uncontrollable emotions.
- After the spotting period, I have no periods. Ever. For the next two years. Score.
- I don't have to remember to take anything and it's in my arm, which is a lot better than inserting it anywhere else, if you ask me. 
- Zero weight gain issues (I fluctuate naturally with my sweet tooth but I've been eating well and exercising and don't have any problems taking weight off).
- No monthly bloating or mood swings. 
- I've been fortunate enough to not really have had any severe skin issues pre birth control, but I can say I have not had any breakout problems with this method, either.

The process itself of getting it inserted was crazy simple - they numb the area on the inside of your non dominate upper arm, insert the match-sized plastic piece, slap a band-aid on and call it a day. They give you a plastic card (like a credit card) with the insertion date and other info for when you have to have it removed or if any medical stuff comes up that requires you disclose your birth control method. 

So far I have zero regrets. For what I paid after insurance (about $99), I've already made my money back not having to buy pads or tampons. Of course Implanon affects everyone differently and I've had a good experience. If you're thinking about effective birth control, ask your doctor about it. :)

I'm a really small person, and before I started this job a year ago I didn't even realize I *could* yell, let alone do it for a living. However, the louder I get, the higher my voice gets. It becomes really difficult to get the attention of rowdy customers without either screaming, ""HEY! STOP TALKING!"" or relying on a (usually male) customer to yell for me.

I've asked many of my coworkers how they deal with being ignored. Either they don't, because it doesn't happen; or they use tactics that are a lot easier when you're a 6-ft-something man, such as ""Stare at the customer until they realize you're looking at them"" (They usually can't even see my face over the crowd people in front of me). When my male coworkers yell angrily, they're being good at their job. When I do the exacct the same thing, my managers get a complaint about bad customer service.

Of course, an obvious answer would be to just not yell. When I'm not screaming, my voice sounds a lot friendlier, but it's also a lot quieter. Which, again, becomes really difficult to work with in a room full of 10-40 people.

(On another note, I've noticed when I'm nicer with the customers- again, especially male ones- they think they can get away with breaking the rules and just generally making complete pricks of themselves, because not only am I small and weak, but I'm apparently not angry about anything either.)

Where do I begin? I'll start by saying I have PCOS (Polycystic ovary syndrome) because I feel like that might mean something? My periods have always been once every two or three months, and almost always lasted 3-4 days max and this worked great for me.

Fast forward to this year when I became sexually active and decided to start birth control (NuvaRing). The first three months were good, period came right around the break week, and lasted a little longer than my normal periods but that was fine, I knew things would be a little off with the change. This month is different. The day before I took the ring out for the break week, I started getting this very thick, DARK brown discharge that I have never had before. It lasted for more than a week and I just figured that maybe it was my body getting used to the nuva ring and that would be my period for that month. Although when my period started, after I inserted the new ring might I add, I was a little confused but didn't worry much about it. Well that whole thing started on June 9th! It is now almost July 8th and it is showing no signs of slowing down. A whole month of bleeding and I am going insane!! I'm also starting to get a little concerned.

I live in Canada so going to the doctor will be no problem, but I just wanted to ask around first and see if I should be worried at all, or if anyone has as experienced anything like this?

I haven't actually gotten my period in a few months, which is ""normal"" for me (in that, not a single one of my doctors have been able to figure out why my period skips sometimes). At least, I've gone a couple of months before, but it's actually been gone since November which is slightly less normal than the usual.

Context:

As much as I love my career/day job, it doesn't provide me with a creative outlet.  So I joined a cover band - sometimes we dress up in crazy outfits and sing 80's songs, and other times we just dress normally and perform songs that we have completely flipped and transformed into something different - like turning a rock song into a jazz song.  I like it because I feel like it's not only a metaphor for life, but also for anything that is creative - everything is a remix and I love re-creating things! 

So more about the band I am in - when I moved to the city I am currently living in, I auditioned for and joined a band that is kind of beloved by their city a little bit.  They have a standing gig at a popular bar/eatery thingy once per month, and people seem to love them.  The money get get paid for their work, they use to buy ppl drinks after performances, buy better instruments, or buy more crazy costumes.  I am their new band member - its so much fun!  I get to do guitar and vocals.   I was very lucky as apparently there were lots of ppl auditioning.  OMG pressure!!! 


In a few weeks we will be doing something a bit different.  We are opening for the drummer's friend's band at a large evening backyard wedding.  These people have money and their backyard is freaking huge and they are very serious about the music that will be playing and such.    They even gave us written instructions about behavior and stuff even though we are only playing ONE song and opening for the main band! 


Its also different because we will be performing [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHlhOgQ36m8) song, mostly unaltered.    No funny costumes this time, no transforming the song - my band has instructed me to actually dress like a rocker chick and 'be sexy'.  


This is where my problem lies.  HALP I am an accountant and I literally don't know how to be sexy.  I watched the video and the lady is dancing around but A. I have no idea how to dance, and B.  shes is dancing unencumbered  by a guitar, but I will be playing a guitar.  How do I dance sexily while playing a guitar?!?! halp.   I've only been with this band a month and I kinda can't screw up.  If it helps, I am wearing dark blue skinny jeans, [these](http://www.jcrew.com/womens_category/shoes/sandals/PRDOVR~01384/01384.jsp) shoes in black, and a [mens](http://www.gapcanada.ca/browse/product.do?cid=5231&amp;vid=1&amp;pid=351243043) t shirt in gray like the one in the link - not really fitted.

Choosing oils for the Oil Cleansing Method (x-post r/NaturalBeauty),PrancingPudu,30,5,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/1cqzrq/help_choosing_oils_for_the_oil_cleansing_method/,"I have generally had very clear, not-too-sensitive skin that would err on the dry side in winter.  I skipped on cleaning it regularly since (I thought) I ""never needed to"".  Bad habit to develop!

Over the last two months I've had some issues with my skin (and hair) becoming oilier.  I think something else could be going on that's making things wonky, because this started two months ago kind of without reason.  I want to try the OCM to at least help clear up all the junk that's starting to build up, but I'm completely lost as to what oils to start with and am a little afraid of breaking out further.  I'm not used to dealing with acne, which has been a blessing, but now I'm entering unknown territory and am completely lost as to what would help.  *I'm happy to post pictures if that would help, too.*


**My Skin TL;DR:**

*  I would still describe my skin as relatively balanced, though it has been oilier than it's usual well-moisturized-and-maybe-a tad-dry-ness.  

*  I get lots of whiteheads/deeper junk around my chin (never red acne though), with occasional blackheads.  I also get these popping up on my temples/forehead sometimes.  

*  Lately I've been getting one small red zit after another, usually one at a time.  Generally I only get one or two when my hormones peak every month, so I'm not sure why I'm suddenly getting them so often/regularly.


I'm very good about leaving angry zits them alone or cleansing them safely and appropriately, but I'm still working on keeping my hands away from my chin/mouth area.


I have read [this wonderful post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1a1cj3/everything_you_wanted_to_know_about_ocm_the_oil/) about the OCM, and now I'm down to deciding what oils I want to start with from Garden of Wisdom.  I am going for one of the [Balanced Skin Sample Packs](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/catalog/item/7018338/7053345.htm), maybe two depending on what everyone recommends.  Oils with anti-aging/wrinkle properties really appeal to me, but clearing up my skin is number one.  After reading through the descriptions of every one of the oil options, I have narrowed it down to these:

*  **Baobab Oil**: absorbs quickly, does not clog pores, conditioning, very rich and stable

*  **Black Raspberry Seed**: light, absorbs quickly into skin, fights signs of aging, antioxidant

*  **Brazil Nut Oil**: conditioning, very rich and stable, high in selenium

*  **Candela Infused Oil**: regenerative, anti-inflammatory, soothing, promotes circulation

*  **Camellia Oil (Olferia)**: excellent skin and hair conditioning properties, anti-aging, fights wrinkles, helps to diminish fine lines, nice and light weight, emollient

*  **Hazelnut Oil**: slightly astringent, tones skin, fast absorption rate, tightens skin, maintains firmness and elasticity of skin, helps to strengthen capillaries, encourages cell regeneration, stimulates circulation

*  **Jojoba Oil Gold**: dissolves sebum and limits oil production in oily skin, protects skin while allowing to to breath, antioxidant, not greasy and sinks right into skin

*  **Meadowfoam Oil**: one of the best oils to prevent moisture loss, conditioning, excellent for dry and dehydrated skin, adds shine and nourishment to hair, very stable

*  **Passion Fruit/Marajuca Oil**: antibacterial, anti-itch, anti-inflammatory

*  **Tamanu Oil**: emollient, regenerative, great around delicate tissue, analgesic, softening


Should I consider something like Flax Seed Oil or Chardonnay Grapeseed Oil for the somewhat oilier skin I've been dealing with?  Or the pH-restoring effects of Pomegranate Oil?

Though feeling confident with my decision for various reasons, I decided to torture myself by reading all about how this form of BC became disastrous for some individuals.

The couple friends I've reached out to about opinions over the IUD have resulted in bad reviews. The few ladies I've contacted through other internet resources have been very outspoken about how awful of an experience it was. I read yet another story in this subreddit about something going awry.

As I sit here... or rather awkwardly switch between sitting and standing to alleviate the pressure on my lady parts... I am starting to worry that something is off about the statistics. The only people I've heard positive reviews from were the clinicians I was talking to when preparing to get an IUD.

Surely there have to be more women who have IUDs and lived happily ever after, right?

I would love, love, love to hear your positive experiences... What was it like the first couple of days? Months? Did you experience discomfort that made you doubt your decision? After the procedure, how long did it take for you to feel ""normal"" and not concerned over whether or not you'd have something go terribly, terribly wrong? What are some things I should be prepared for? What were some things that surprised you about the IUD (good or bad)? I dunno... share with me your experiences with getting used to something in your uterus!

I don't have many proper outlets for girl talk and would appreciate the company and comfort of ladies who can understand the concern I have.

Short story is I grew up hating my hair, and never took care of it at all. 
Now I have been trying to take care of it and work with it to make nice curls and make it soft. 
My only concern is that it has become thin. My hairdresser told me it could be from stress because I am balancing college/work/relationship all at the same time. I also started to take my daily vitamins as regularly as I can in the morning. 
Nothing has helped much so I want advice on any good hair products or hair masks that can make my hair grow fuller again and not fall out!
Hair products I do use are:
Bed Head shampoo/ conditioner
Bed Head leave in conditioner for moisture
Loreal gel for curls to hold in my curls nicely.

For my posture, I can only blame myself and my mom. She has a slouching back, and I got it from her. I was a tom boy all my life also until mid middle school. Posture was never my worry at all. 
I just need good helpful tips that can fix my posture and make it more healthy on my back and legs ( I do work standing up all day and running around ).

TL;DR
Need tips to stop my hair from falling out and stimulate it's growth
and to help fix my posture so that I don't slouch. ",,False,self,t5_2vfzu,False,,,True,t3_16j8ss,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/16j8ss/my_hair_is_thinning_and_my_posture_sucks/,

But part of my problem, is walking in heels. Heels aren't *that* bad, but they aren't the easiest to walk around in, and I was wondering if there were any tips on that - or if you just have to practice a lot. Or both?

Another thing is, how do you not be awkward? This is a room filled the teenagers, and I won't know over half of them. The ones that I do know aren't really great people, but they're not bad. They're the overconfident type that would be grinding all over each other, or something. How do you walk around with an air of confidence and happiness? How do you *dance*? Are you even supposed to really dance at these types of things? *How does this work?!*

I usually always have uneven skin with some sort of break out, along with pores the size of golfballs in my T-zone with minor blackheads. But lately it's gotten worse, I wake up with 4-5 new zits a day, and a lot of times they're the cysty/under the skin type which are always sore and red. My skin then goes on to scab and peel/bleed and scar. Not sure if this is PMS and stress induced or not, but I'm tired of it and want to try new products or a new routine. I try not to wear a lot of makeup either because I'm sensitive and it almost always clogs my pores.


**I want to know what you ladies do to keep your acne under control and your skin looking radiant!**


* What products do you use? 
* What make up do you use? 
* What tips, tricks and overall techniques/routines do you want to share with us?!
* Do you have a special face mask? Zit mask? 


*I want to compile some sort of list. I see alot of tips on reddit but I always feel overwhelmed reading paragraph/novels  so maybe lets try something like this.* 




***Products:*** 

* **Clean &amp; Clear ultra daily exfoliating scrub**: I used to LOVE their old formula but they went and changed it!! It claims to eliminate scarring and marks but I don't see a difference unfortunately. I use this in the shower.
* **Clean and Clear face mousturizer:** I find that other moisturizers clog my pores and make me break out, this has some acne fighting ingredients but doens't hydrate as much as I'd like. I use this after the shower.
* **Equate Exfoliating Cleansing Towelettes** I use these before bed to remove makeup and dirt buildup
 


***Makeup:***

* **Almay skin clearing conceler** I think it works but dries out and scabs and flakes my skin...
* **True Match Naturale Mineral Founation** - Doesn't seem to clog my pores too badly but I think I'd like to try a different kind. Maybe the almay foundation

***Tricks***

* **Eyedrops:** I've noticed it helps with the redness of a zit but I'm always afraid I'm adding to the problem and creating bacteria build up...is this true?


* **Apple Cider Vinegar** I've heard this is good for your skin/pH but I've been taking it daily and using it as a toner and I haven't noticed any improvement. I'm starting to wonder if it's causing the breakouts..

Anyways. I guess the biggest issues I have are:

* Scabbing/Peeling
* Scarring
* Sensitive skin
* Irritated red cyst zits",,False,self,t5_2vfzu,False,,,True,t3_12wa6j,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/12wa6j/request_acneprone_ladies_what/,

1376285736.0,19,self.TheGirlSurvivalGuide,1k6vda,"[request/tips] long hair help? hair looks flat and messy if dried naturally, but im trying to avoid blow drying now to take better care of my hair",TheDreadPirateRobert,24,5,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/1k6vda/requesttips_long_hair_help_hair_looks_flat_and/,"So my hair is fairly long now, out of laziness rather than style, but I'm really liking the length and would like to take better care of it. I have pretty naturally straight hair, only the ends get wavy if it dries naturally (which is part of the problem that i'll get into). I've been told by a few hairstylists that I have a surprising amount of hair because the individual strands themselves are not that thick, but i have a lot of hair per inch (or square inch? what is the measurement for amount of hair on your head?) on my head.

Normally I style my hair by just blow drying it by flipping my head upside down and using a brush to comb through the length. I try not to get to close to the hair or my roots with the blow dryer and I use Kiehls heat protective silk straightening cream religiously and highly recommend it. I love doing my hair this way because i like the volume and the straightness of my hair. I tend to leave it down longer before it gets annoying and all in my face and I end up putting it up in a ponytail or messy bun (part of the problem).

The problem is I've become more conscious of the health of my hair and would like to take better care of it. One issue is that the ends of my hair tend to get knotted and tangled pretty easily, so by the end of the day it starts to look bad and if I havent already, I end up putting it in a messy bun and leaving it there the rest of the day and night. (as mentioned)

My hair also gets really oily and greasy really quickly. I wash my hair usually every other day (admittedly sometimes even longer), but even that second day tends to look a little shiny and I get self conscious and stick it in a bun. Heck by the end of the first day of washing it it gets oily enough to the point where I notice it and put it up. If it's been a few days, I put it in a ridiculously tight ponytail and leave it there all day. If my head starts to hurt from being in a ponytail all day, I just switch to a messy bun. I've tried several dry shampoos but honestly, they all just seem to make it worse (the greasiness and they also make it way more knotted). 

Now the main issue I'm having is trying to let my hair dry naturally. I just hate the way it ends up looking after a shower. Since my hair is pretty long already, when it's wet it gets weighed down so my hair looks really flat (and YES even sometimes greasy even though it's clean. like. really?) on the top of my head. Around my ears it starts to twist inwards towards my face and then from the nape of my neck to the middle of my back its either wavy or tangled, sometimes both and sometimes frizzy, and I just think it looks so messy and unattractive. It could be perfectly tangle free and yet look like I didn't brush it all day and just woke up like that and left it. Because of this, I usually hardly ever leave it down when I wash it and like to keep it in a bun (big surprise. it's my favorite hairdo apparently). How can I style it so it looks nice when I dry it naturally, and so I don't have to blow dry it every time I dry my hair? Also what can I do to keep my hair from getting so oily? Any types of  shampoos/conditioners/leave-in conditioners you can suggest would be helpful. And any other easy style tips in general? If you haven't already figured it out, I cant do much past a ponytail or messy bun so anything easy and cute I can learn to do would be much appreciated. 

Thanks ladies. Sorry if this is a wall 'o text. :)

Edit: I just want to add the wavyness wouldn't be that bad or annoying if the top of my hair didn't end up flat and stick directly to the top of my head. It looks like really bad hat hair, where the length of my hair has all this body and volume, but the top of my head is flat and oily and depressing haha",,False,self,t5_2vfzu,1376286807.0,,,True,t3_1k6vda,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/1k6vda/requesttips_long_hair_help_hair_looks_flat_and/,

1363316892.0,19,self.TheGirlSurvivalGuide,1abug4,[Discussion] Chronic Illnesses - What do you have and what tips have you learned along the way?,missdeejers,24,5,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/1abug4/discussion_chronic_illnesses_what_do_you_have_and/,"Unfortunately, many of us suffer from chronic illnesses, everything from gastrointestinal illnesses to hormonal dysfunction to autoimmune diseases.

However, as a sufferer of a chronic illness, I have found that many of us are disconnected from other fellow people who suffer from the same problem, and thus, are left to figure out the tricks of the trade on our own. I really wish I had know people who could give me tips about my disease.

So, I propose a little experiment in order to help others. 

Proposal: Let us know about your chronic illness and tell us tips that you have learned along the way - tips that you don't necessarily learn from a doctor. For example, are there foods that trigger symptoms? How do you deal with the emotional aspects? How do you deal with social complications from your illness? How do you make yourself feel better on bad days?

I'll start: I have gastroparesis. I was diagnosed 5 years ago. Here are my tips:

* The usual medication prescribed (Reglan) is associated with cases of tardive dyskensia. Instead of relying on medication (and I know that for many, medication is the only way), I have learned to control my symptoms by closely managing my diet (avoiding trigger foods) and controlling my stress.

* With a low fiber diet, I find that I am low on many vitamins and minerals. I prefer gummy and liquid vitamins over swallowable capsules and I invested in a juicer that takes out the pulp. I then strain the juice using a cheesecloth (or a similar device) to take out all of the pulp.

* Figure out your triggers as soon as possible! For everyone, the trigger foods are different. Some people can eat fatty foods and other cannot. Some people can eat some fruit and other cannot. My life was made a million times better when I learned what I could not eat without an episode and learned to avoid it.

* Laying on your side after a meal can help empty your stomach.

* If my digestion is slow, I have my boyfriend help ""push"" my food through my intestines, belly rub style.

* When dealing with social interactions where I am pressured to eat things I should not eat, I rely on the advice of [Captain Awkward](http://captainawkward.com/2012/11/25/398-im-tired-of-explaining-my-medical-condition-to-helpful-folks/) - You do not have to discuss your illness or explain your food choices to anyone. It is none of their business.

* Even though it can be very hard to muster the energy and enthusiasm to exercise, I have found that keeping a regular exercise schedule helps not only my digestion, but my energy levels! Even something as low-impact as an easy yoga session is better than nothing.

* Find a helpful doctor who either has a lot of experience with gastrointestinal illnesses or has the willingness to learn. There is nothing more frustrating when doctors try to give you advice when they obvious don't know about the disease.

1. Hair. I dye my hair quite a bit. 3-6 times a year, usually with at least one bleaching. For the most part, my scalp/hair has been extremely healthy but sadly has not healed from this last round.

2. When I'm not biting them, I like to grow my nails out. They can get extremely brittle and weak. What can I use on them to strengthen them?

3. Make up. No one ever taught me how to do make up and I don't even know where to begin. The only thing I have experimented with is a set of four with the steps on the back and where each one is supposed to go.

**Tip #1:** Someone else has already sung the praises of baking soda here, but mix it with lemon juice and baby, you got a cleanser going. You can't just mix up a batch and use that continuously, though - you want the foaming interaction between the acid and base substances, not a neutral solution. Mix it up right before you use it, and you'll have a nice, acne-clearing scrub. It's a fantastic exfoliant for blackheads and, depending on the pressure you use, it can polish you up like old silver, or it can be rather gentle. Also, I've heard that long-term use of lemon juice can lighten marks on the skin leftover from the ghosts of pimples past (or what have you). Sensitive-skinned folk should exercise caution, as the fine grit and acidity of the lemon juice could be too much for them. That's not to say that you can't use it - my skin is somewhat sensitive, and this is one of my favorites.

**Tip #2:** Rice flour is your friend. You can buy it finely-ground from the store and it'll be great for your skin just as it is. However, I made my own at home (you can look up how to do it online), which made it pretty grainy and an excellent exfoliant - about the consistency of an apricot scrub. It took some time, but very little effort, and I bet a lot of you have rice (not the quick-cooking kind!) sitting in your cupboard. I'm not sure exactly why it's good for your skin, but I do know it leaves your face smooth and slightly moisturized, and I know I see an improvement when I use it consistently. Feels good, man. Those with sensitive skin might want to go with storebought for the finer, less abrasive texture.

**Tip #3:** Oatmeal can face (**GET IT??**) and conquer a host of epidermal evils. You can mix it with honey or yogurt (you heard me) or some other skin-yummy ingredient or use it on its own. If you do that, what you want to do is hold a bit of it in your fist tightly enough so that it doesn't fall out, but not so tightly that water can't get to it, and run it under some warm water so that it becomes completely moistened. (I know you all love that word, don't you? [Moist](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=apEZpYnN_1g#t=332s) is everyone's favorite word.) Then, you take that goopy, boogery mass sitting in the palm of your hand and you slather it over your face like it's the blood of your enemies. Putting on this and other lumpy face masks originating from the kitchen is usually what makes my boyfriend wonder if he should have me committed. Regardless of how crazy you look, though, it works. Oatmeal can sooth redness, whether it's from a sunburn or just irritated skin, it's an exfoliant gentle enough to use daily, and it's GREAT for moisturizing. You can rinse it off right away like a face wash or leave it on for 15-30 minutes as a mask. Excellent for sensitive skin.

**Tip #4:** Another scrub that's really quick to put together is oil (or cold cream, if you'd rather - it's nice too) and sugar. I think this has been mentioned elsewhere, too, but I didn't want to leave it out since it's such a nice scrub! This one's not just for your face, either - olive oil and brown sugar are especially nice pre-shaving or for rough knees and elbows. Sugar is good for your skin because it contains alpha-hydroxy acid, or AHA, which... does good stuff. I don't know the particulars. Oil is good for your skin too, as much as that may go against your instincts. Olive oil is one of the more easily accessible ones, but you can get fancy with other skin-friendly oils as well. Which leads me to...

**Tip #5:** Fight oil with oil. It may feel horribly counterproductive to rub a bunch of oil into your greasy skin, but, trust me, it's not. At least, not for most people - I'm sure there are some for whom this wouldn't work, as is almost certainly true of each of these tips. I've found myself mentioning this a lot lately: the Oil Cleansing Method, or OCM. You want castor oil, which is so good at cleansing your skin that it can leave it a little dry, and you also want a carrier oil to take care of moisturizing - that's where you can have fun and adjust to your skin's weird quirks. As I said before, olive isn't a bad choice, but some might find that it's too heavy, or light, for their skin. Jojoba, argan, sunflower, apricot, coconut, grapeseed: you can use these or whatever other oil seems to suit your needs. I like to shop around on Amazon and Ebay for good prices. Oil is very sensitive-skin friendly, and it feels reeaally nice, especially if you warm it just a little. What you should do is place a nice hot washcloth on your face to open your pores (although it's not really necessary, it can help), massage the oil into your skin for up to a couple of minutes, and rinse off with hot water. This is a great acne treatment, although it has been known to cause breakouts initially as it purges your skin of the nasty stuff already inside of it. I've heard that this treatment is exceptional for cystic acne and for preventing aging, although neither of those are problems that I'm dealing with at the moment. Anyway, it feels like a mini spa treatment and leaves you very soft (but not oily, if you rinsed well enough).

**Tip #6:** Vinegar isn't just for stain removal. This one is short - you can use apple cider vinegar mixed 50/50 with water (or full-strength, but watch out for broken skin!) as a toner. It's supposed to be very good for acne, and you can dilute it to a strength that's comfortable for your skin. I've heard Bragg's with the ""mother"" is best, but I've never tried it. Cheap Fred Meyer brand for me, yeah!

**Tip #7:** You can do fun things with papaya. Blending a mixture of papaya fruit, lemon juice, lime juice, and maybe throwing some honey in there if you've got it, can make a nice face mask. Lime juice can make your skin glow and papaya is softening. I neglected to mention it before, but honey is good for your face because it pulls things out of your pores *and* it's antibacterial, meaning it can kill the proverbial acne-causing bacteria. I suspect its ability to kill tiny organisms is why it never spoils - I read about archaeologists eating some they had excavated in a tomb! But I digress. This mask will also make you look like an asylum outpatient, but it's nice. (Bonus tip: this is a good mask, but it's a GREAT hair mask. I saw a noticeable difference after putting this on my hair.)

That's all I can think of for now, but if I remember any more I'll add them later. Some of these came from [this](http://www.youtube.com/bubzbeauty) youtube channel - the girl who makes these videos does hair, makeup, and skin tutorials and she's super sweet!

1.  Can I pack shaving cream in my luggage? We're flying down and I don't know if the can will be safe in my checked luggage. Could it explode/etc? If it will, what could I bring instead? Is it even allowed in luggage?


2.  I'm very pale, and will be out in the sun essentially all day, every day for a week. What type of sunscreen would be best? I would like to tan up a little bit, but I won't be just laying in the sun.


3.  Would it be a better idea to bring multiple travel-sized bottles of shampoo and conditioner? I was thinking of just bringing a regular sized bottle of shampoo and getting a friend to bring the conditioner, it would take up less room. What do you think?

The stylist I saw is from Albania, so maybe this is a cultural thing.

Gel nail polish is a resin that is painted on the nail just like regular polish but instead is set with UV light (usually a minute or two of exposure per coat). A gel manicure set correctly will stick to your nails and NOT chip. Mine usually lasts 3-4 weeks until I take it off and repaint (because new nail grows in and not because the paint chips off).

I hadn't had a manicure in 10 years and popped in to treat myself. I was sold when they told me about long lasting gel manicures. Holy shit. For three weeks, I was digging soil pits and throwing rocks and my nails were **IMMACULATE.** The resin of the gel polish finishes thicker than traditional polish (You must do base coat, color, and top coat). My nails never chipped and never did the polish look scuffed or dull; it was a great relief to grow out my nails without worrying about them chipping (as they often break when long)

After one manicure I bought a base coat, color, and top coat in Gelish's Gel nail polish (My original manicure was with OPI brand gel polish but Gelish was cheaper on amazon so I got it). I bought a home light at a beauty supply store (which ended up being crappy and replaced) and I am so happy to have switched to gel polish.

Gel polish can only be done with a full manicure procedure, you have to shape your nails, buff them, and dry them with a nail-prep solution before you can begin doing coats (which need to set completely). **This no need for an acrylic nail bed for gel manicures, it sets right on your natural nail.** Gel manicures can be a tad tricky to set and do because the outermost layer of the polish will not set because the oxygen in the air prevents it from setting. So you need to be able to judge if gel has set under the tacky wet layer on top. After applying the top coat, you need to remove the tacky outermost layer with a cleaning solution. ALL these gel polish suppliers sell these nail prep and top coat solutions but you should **NEVER** buy these. Regular rubbing alcohol is a chemically equivalent solution that will dry out your nails adequately for the manicure and will remove the tackiness of the top coat without destroying your manicure.

Two major downside to gel polishes:

1. You really do have to love the color you choose because you're stuck with it. I went with a deep red wine color and I would highly recommend gel polish to chicks that don't like to switch colors often or those that don't sweat it if their outfit clashes with their nails.

2. Price. A bottle is about $12/each and you must buy at least the base and top coat for any color you're using. You also need a UV lamp and you should never spend less than $30 on the light.

3. Prep. You need to buff your nails well for the resin to stick, and you need to take steps to make sure that the resin adheres to the nail. You need to follow the steps because if you forget (which happens) you will have to start over from square one.",TIP,False,self,t5_2vfzu,False,,,True,t3_14tt5y,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/14tt5y/painting_your_nails_gel_manicures_are_worth_it/,

I know turning to review sites such as Yelp are a good first choice, but I've generally found that the reviews for Brazilians seem to be a mix of ""Oh it was painless"" (sure!) and ""She ripped skin off my labia."" (Yes that's a real quote from one place)

Additionally, most of the places that I've found to be most appealing are outside of my price range as a grad student. It seems the going price in my city is around $70 or so, but with most places being above that rather than below.

After searching I've found some groupons that would knock the price down to between $30-35 but honestly...I'm such an SAP that the idea of using a groupon makes me anxious. For example, how do you tip? Not like how much do you tip, but how do you physically do it when you've already prepaid?!

I found some places in some of the nearby satellite communities that come in between $40-50 but reviews for those services are scant. One place in town I was leaning towards has them for $50 but that's where the labia ripping review came from...

It got a little better after that, but not by much. Squats and whatnot were still uncomfortable, and my elbows/knees (but mostly knees) would still get achy every so often.

I think this is a good subreddit to post in--girl surviving in the neighborhood, that sort of thing.

I recently moved in to a new place with some new roommates. My roommates are totally awesome--some of the nicest people I've met. They have three dogs, and since the roommates are off at work during the day, I take the dogs out in the yard to play and not make messes inside the house. Well, today they made some messes anyways. One of them puked on the stairs, the other one disemboweled a toy. I decided to put the dogs out in the yard so I could clean up easier, and because it was about time for them to relieve themselves anyway.

I had barely opened the door when the two bigger dogs shot out and started barking and some neighbors by their truck. I wrangled the dogs back (got one on a leash, the other was too riled up (he's halfway between being a puppy and being an adult, so he's got a lot of energy and wants to assert his dominance, and he doesn't always listen to me right away since he's still in training) so I had to put him back inside. I felt really bad that the dogs kept barking and were trying to run up to the guys in the truck. Even so, the guys were cool about it. After I got the dogs under control and the mess inside cleaned up, they offered a beer and introduced themselves. They were really cool about everything, and understood that one 20-something girl against three dogs is tough.

Almost right after all the introductions, one of them offered a beer (I think they were taking a break from yard work or something) and we started talking, then one of the ladies who lived there came outside and stared me down. She started telling me all about one of the neighbors' relationships (""He's divorced and has kids, yadda yadda yadda"") and something about the other one, who was her son, and told me something along the lines of ""Oh, it's nice that you live over there with your boyfriend"" (I don't, the guy living with me is just a roommate, and dating the other girl here)  ""and you can have as many dogs as you want, but you gotta get up and move the party elsewhere. Just leave."" I kept apologizing to her and got up to leave; I have no idea what I did wrong. Her son and the other one, his friend, kept telling the lady no and kept telling me to stay, but I really didn't want to piss her off anymore than I apparently already had, and left back to my place. The two other guys apologized to me and came with me. The son kept telling me, ""She's just a bitch,"" and the other one told me that he didn't know why the lady was acting that way and that she wasn't telling me the truth about him. Then the two nice neighbors and I hung out outside for a bit and talked.

Does anyone here have any advice as of what to do? Do I apologize to her for something? I have no idea what I did wrong. The only thing I can think of was the dogs barking today, or another time a couple weeks ago when I would let these little girls there (angry lady's grandchildren?) play with the dogs, since  I don't know my roommates' rules on their dogs interacting with other people, and fuck me if anything happened to the little girls on behalf of one of the dogs playing rougher than he should. I'm actually really upset about this and crying as I type. I've had plenty of rude/odd roommates and got along smoothly with them even if we didn't necessarily like each other, but I've honestly never lived or dealt with anyone like her, and I've never had any rude neighbors. Aside from I'm really at a loss of what to do. I'm going to be living here for the next few months and I don't want to make any matters worse.

Sorry for any typos or posting incorrectly or anything in advance. I'm just really fucking frazzled right now and would really appreciate you fine ladies' advice.

* Fixed my haircut: Very very short on the sides and longer on top.

* Relaxing bath and some skin care (DAT smoothness)

* Too lazy to work out, so I danced to the Sisters of Mercy in front of the mirror. That was funny and really took the pain and anger away. Plus, I think I love my body a bit more right now.

* Just chill on the porch (I don't know why I don't do this more often)

* Some lovely pet time ([Monti](http://imgur.com/qAbrBDN) and I want to say thank you!)

I've had acne in high school and into my twenties (21 now). I've gone to a dermatologist who was useless: did not identify why I kept having acne, tried to push her own product/ treatments on me and spoke to me for a total of 3 minutes. I tried so many things I cant even list right now, suggested by derms, friends, etc., but it usually kept either super drying my skin and then super oiling it. Eventually my doctor told me i have a hormone imbalance which causes my acne (among other unpleasant things). I kept using the same products that would dry the pimples and then moisturize my skin (told by dermatologist). Most recently I finally started birth control (almost one month).
My acne has stopped being severe but now I have red patches of skin that have flaking skin. I moisturize 3 or 4 times a day with Nivea facial cream but I have no idea what to do. I only have this on my face. It used to occasionally appear around my nostrils but it was usually in the winter. Then it started under my mouth. Now its my nose, mouth, dthe creases of my smile, and most recently a part of my forehead. I moisturize it like crazy. It helps keep away the look of the flakes, but it is still red and the flakes come back in an hour or so. It feels like I will never have normal skin no matter what.

I think the reasoning behind it was how we tend to strip our skin of natural oils so our skin over produces oil and then we have skin problems. CHANGED MY LIFE! not that exact thing but the idea behind it. Here is what I have been doing for about 2 months:

-Morning: Rinse skin with cold water, pat dry with washcloth, use toner and under eye cream (+face cream if it's dry).

-Throughout the day: Use oil blotter sheets

-Night: Wash face with an acne wash, under eye cream, and night cream. 

It is minimal and has made a huge difference! I think for me personally the key is leaving oil on your skin. It seems counter intuitive but it is working!

Coconut Oil
Castor Oil
Extra Virgin Olive Oil

I did a small amount of castor oil, coconut oil and olive oil. I put this all in a bowl then in the microwave so the coconut oil would soften, then I put it in my dry hair. I saturated my hair completely and worked it in with my fingers from tip to root. Then I let it sit for a half hour while I made a coconut oil/castor oil face wash (came out great) and a coconut oil/granulated sugar body scrub (LOVED IT). 

I got in the shower and my hair felt like straw. Really really dry. I took my shower and used shampoo but not conditioner. (sometimes if I use too much conditioner my hair gets oily, and I figured there was already so much oil in my hair)

So I get out of the shower, dry my hair and it felt incredibly oily. Which put me off a little because before I used the shampoo I spent a few minutes running my fingers through my hair and trying to get the oil out. So I hop back in and rinse my hair again. I get out and throw a towel in my hair to let it dry. It took a lot longer than usual to dry and I ended up just falling asleep. This morning my hair felt disgusting. I walked out of my room and my sister said it looked like I cracked an egg on my head. I showered YET again. Used conditioner this time, I want this oil out of my hair. 

My hair is STILL oily. It's not too bad but it has a gross shine to it, it looks wet and feels like wax. I have no idea what to do or where I went wrong. All the comments under the post where I got this recipe from said it came out amazing.

I figure the good news is the post said the longer you keep the oil in your hair the nicer your hair comes out, so I'm on 24 hours.

**Brief**


Glycerine (an odorless, colorless and sweet liquid) was popularized in soap-making, and is found in loads of skin-care and hair-care products (take a look!). It's also used as a sugar-substitute [1] in food and as one of the main ingredients in electronic cigarette 'juice' for vapor production (why *I* bought some!).

It's supposed to be non-irritating, so it should be suitable for sensitive skin. IANAD.


**Effect &amp; Use**


With a bit of water, it's a pretty awesome multipurpose moisturizer, especially in winter. My skin, especially my lips, get really dry and flaky. I recently put some in my hair and my unknowing sister asked if I had switched shampoo! Naw, just glycerine. My skin has also been looking pretty good!

Note that depending on use, especially on skin, you might feel a little sticky for a while. I'd recommend using it after a shower or before sleeping for your hair/as a moisturizer, and applying a small amount during the day as necessary.   


Some have reported it helps with breakouts, though I can't 100% attest to this. I get bumps in cold weather, though, and they look to have subsided!


**Buy**


You should be able to find glycerine in Health Food stores or the pharmacy, but I buy it [online](http://www.iherb.com/?rcode=VEK587)[2] for about 6-7 bucks for half a liter (16 fl. oz.).

I cycle to and from college, through the city I live in. I am a design student attending an Art&amp;Design college, so my wardrobe is utilitarian meets business [I study design and it's serious business :p ]

I'm kinda curious about ladies and cycling culture. It's a relatively new phenomenon in my city, so I feel there's a lot to learn. I want to see if there's anyone else here who is a daily cyclist and if we can share tips and tricks? I find it particularly interesting when people don't dress as a cyclist if you know what I mean? I don't like to think that anything I own anything – dress, pants, heels alike – that makes it impossible for me to cycle efficiently and safely as well as looking well ;)

Starter questions?
Who of ye cycle?
What do ye wear?
How do ye cope in the wind and the rain?
How do ye cope with possible feminism issues that may arrise?
Any tricks? :)


Here are some tips and tricks I've learned over the years:

*1) rain pants saved my presentation. Pack 'em and thank 'em later.

*2) assume that no-one actually knows how to drive. When in doubt, walk your bike and you'll have the same rights as a pedestrian. No-one will think any less of you if you don't make that left turn.

*3) I went through a bad patch of having eczema on my face, applying some vaseline before setting out in the winter cold really helped it heal faster.

*4) along with your lights, spare tube and repair kit, pack facial wipes and some cable ties and clear nail varnish. The wipes can mop up blood, oil and what not, the cable ties are hand if your pannier/bag breaks, while the nail varnish can quickly seal scratches in your bike to prevent rush and fix the ladders on your tights should you have had a fall.

*5) If I don't want to be sweaty arriving, I'll usually wear a vest top under my coat and change into the fancier thang upon arrival.

*6) if you're like me, and you cycle a racer with slim wheels, you're not going to feel safe during ice season. Try sourcing a cheap mountain bike and driving short nails into the tyres for extra grip [I can elaborate further on this one] it's a really cheap way to make ice tyres.

*7) I have panniers but I don't use them, they're often a hazard for traffic, if your route takes you through narrow street roads as mine does. A messenger bag or extra strapping on a back-pack helps carry loads and gives you better balance and control.

*8) for god's sake, don't put your back light on the front of your bike! I have seen this as a cyclist and driver and it's really very off-putting. If you're not lit at night, walk or park and ride. By investing in proper lights, you're ensuring you and everyone in your vicinity is that little bit safer. I hear good things about fluro vests, but I am skeptical! 

*9) know your limits. Mine is about two, two and a half glasses of wine.

I've suffered some... abnormal signs this morning/afternoon and am becoming very anxious and upset at the possibility of what it could be and was hoping some of you in this subreddit could help me out..

I woke up this morning bleeding, as if I was having an extremely heavy period. My period has never started this way and even so, I just had my period maybe 3 weeks ago, maximum time period. Any time I think of random heavy bleeding, I think miscarriage, so I went to look up some symptoms.

What I found was:

* Vaginal bleeding, light-heavy, depending

* change in vaginal discharge

* severe abdominal pain, depending

* light to severe cramping, depending

* dull, lower-back ache, pressure, or pain

Now, my boyfriend and I had sex last night, and while I know sex doesn't normally cause miscarriages, he found something on the side of his penis afterwards. It was like a little white blob, kinda sticky and gelatinous(can't spell &gt;&gt;). 

In accordance with this, I was having abdominal pains yesterday, though I thought they were because I was hungry or something, as well as having some cramping feeling, but again assumed they were from indigestion or gas or something.

There was no blood after the sex last night, nor was there any when I got up and went to the bathroom randomly in the middle of the night. I have no idea what time i got up and went to the restroom. 

As of right now, the bleeding has died down quite a bit, but there are more small blood clots than I normally have in my period. I'm having random pains in my abdomen.

I don't know if I've scared myself and am imagining these pains or what's going, but I know I'm not imagining all the blood, which has me really freaked out and scared...

Please, if any of you have ever had an early miscarriage or anything that can help, I would greatly appreciate it.

1356642462.0,18,self.TheGirlSurvivalGuide,15jc26,[REQUEST] Constantly leaking menstrual cup? Maybe fit problems?,menteed,19,1,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/15jc26/request_constantly_leaking_menstrual_cup_maybe/,"Hey all. I wanted to post this in r/menstrual cups but I figured no one would see it. TwoX gets almost TOO much visibility, hahah.

I've been using menstrual cups for about 5-6 years. I started out with a Diva Cup in high school and tossed that out after I dropped it in a very unhygienic area. (I always hated how hard the material was, and it was a little too long for me, even with the stem trimmed.) I didn't have much trouble with leakage unless I was in a hurry during insertion. In fact, I went swimming regularly in high school with no issues.

I switched to a Yuuki after that and it's been about 3 years now. It's softer and shallower - overall more comfortable. (I decided to order it after perusing the LJ community's posts. Wasn't sure about how much I bled, so chose based on dimensions.) I haven't trimmed the stem because I have trouble removing it sometimes, but it is also slightly too long on some days ... but that's not the issue at hand.

**So my problem** is that I always have to wear pantiliners when I use my cup because there is always blood leaking out. I can feel it as surely as I would if I were using only pads. This definitely wasn't the case when I first got the Yuuki. I make sure there's a seal by tugging lightly on it and the holes are always cleaned out before I reinsert. In fact, when I remove it, there's still a tight seal that I have to break - but I still get persistent leakage. My cervix is definitely covered, and it's not due to overflow (I am on BC and have medium-to-light flow), so what could the problem be? Has the cup just somehow worn out? (I thought these were supposed to last for ~5-10 yrs in order to be cost effective.) Maybe it just doesn't fit my body that well?

Thanks in advance for your help!",,False,self,t5_2vfzu,False,,,True,t3_15jc26,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/15jc26/request_constantly_leaking_menstrual_cup_maybe/,

There are makeup brush shampoos, but most are pretty expensive and I was wondering if anyone had any cheap/easy solutions to help clean the brushes? I don't want to damage them, but I'm sure it's unnecessary for me to buy the special ""brush shampoo"".
