A few things that popped into my head on the way to work this morning.  Certain things that will and will always be in the world of WWE.

* **The WWE does not give one shit about the IWC ""Smarks""**
   This is a fact.  The WWE's one and only concern is profit and that's it.  I like Daniel Bryan as much as the next guy but if Cena's making the most money, Cena's winning the title every other month.  His star will eventually fade and there in his place will be a new one, but for now, whoever's bringing the green is all they care about.

* **Great wrestlers do not win championships.  Great personalities do.**
This is the reason John Morrison and Kofi Kingston will never be main eventers.  Both are extremely talented in the ring and are fun to watch but they are god awful on a microphone.  They do enough to have people like them and sell t-shirts but WWE will not put their weight behind them if they can't carry a promo.

*  **No matter how bad RAW gets or how dull it may be compared to the ""good old days"" we will always tune in**
Think of the WWE as your favorite sports team.  When it's good, you're there watching every minute of every game.  When they're shitty you may not watch every game but you still pay attention to the score and want to know what's going on.  

*  **A wrestling match is more entertaining by how many kick outs of pinfalls there are**
If I had the time I'd like to do a study and prove that Wrestlemania main events in the past 10 years average 25 kickouts of pinfalls a match.  Well performed spots make it entertaining but kicking out of finishing moves makes the match epic.

AND I expect downvotes here, but I gotta say it

* **The Attitude Era is overrated**
Hear me out.  The Attitude Era was fun and had some memorable moments.  The era of Steve Austin, The Rock, DX &amp; Mick Foley.  Great legendary stuff.  BUT it had a lot of garbage too.  A LOT.  Mae Young birthing a hand.  Rikishi rubbing his ass in people's faces.  Too Cool.  Big Bossman dragging Big Shows dead fathers casket away.  Corporate Ministry anyone?  WWE did what it had to do to get ratings and they succeeded.  But let's not act like they had a much superior product than they do today.  Even when we complain about SUPERCENA and seeing the same shit over and over again I am reminded how many angles were Austin vs McMahon, Austin vs The Rock, Austin vs Mankind; rinse and repeat.  Shit, eventually they had to turn Austin heel because people were getting tired of him as well.  

All in all I do still enjoy wrestling/WWE and thought I'd share a few things.

Discuss.,rally_tv_viewer,39,15,216,http://www.reddit.com/r/prowrestling/comments/icyzb/the_situation_with_the_moderator_discuss/,"I'm going to say some things about the situation to the community as a whole and I'm going to say some things about the moderator.  And while it's going to be frank and frustratedly honest, I hope he doesn't take it personally.  It seems he's pretty frustrated lately with the situation. *as. are. we.*  So if he's going to delete this post, and maybe ban me, I hope he'll know that it will not silence me either as an individual contributor or silence the content as I can upload it elsewhere.

r/prowrestling is not the moderator's blog.

It is not just his contributions here.  The works here are the works of the community.

He is not the publisher of the content nor the provider of the discussion forums.

He is just the host.  His job is moderator.  His job is to keep us from having to see bots posting advertisements for penis pills and frankly that's all I *want* him to do in his role as moderator.

And many of us are weary about the sole moderator's control over the content, the users, and its application towards serving his own desires, sensibilities, and vendettas.

So, picture a party.  The party has a host, a venue, a guest list, and activities.  

Our host kinda sucks.  And he sucks as a host like having a militant vegetarian as the host of a BBQ - we all love food but he should quit telling us as *the* authority figure what we *should* like to eat, shouldn't criticize our opinions on what's good food, shouldn't whine when people aren't clamoring for or praising his obscure veggie burgers as much as he think we should (but thanks for expanding our horizons!), and certainly shouldn't fucking throw our contributions in the trash if *he* finds it not to be to *his* liking (fucking *""spam!""*).  But when anyone dares to question his tastes, no matter how impersonally (*""now with all that we know about food safety, one would have to be crazy to do that in cooking!""*), he is met with a never-let-them-get-the-last-word argument that is usually unsupported by the rest of the party as a ridiculous argument over the merits of *an opinion* until he ultimately throws the guest out in frustration.  Most of us like *meat.*  A lot of us think we should eat more greens and we all share recipes when some veggie dish is interesting.  Some like foreign.  Some like domestic or even local.  And a lot of people like chain restaurants.  Big deal.  Don't like it - don't eat it.

So this is what we do here: we love discussing restaurants, dishes, recipes, some of us love watching behinds the scenes as it cooks, we shoot the fucking breeze, and we sure as hell love to *eat.*  But *we* bring the food to the potluck.  Not just the moderator.  So hopefully the moderator's actions can change to better reflect the tastes of the community rather than catering solely to his own tastes.

But hey, he says - it's ***HIS*** party.  He signed his fucking name on the gazebo registration form first and damnit no one is going to stay in the park if they make trouble for the host.  But he didn't build the park.  This isn't his home.  It's a public space.  Reddit *communities* (note this:  we're a community, not a fascistically-controlled country.) are about the community getting together and doing what we like.  We didn't come to his park *for him* and certainly not to antagonize him but goddamn is he a real sensitive and argumentative guy.  And people fucking take notice of the host being irrationally angry at people and throwing their friends out for just doing what people do at a party.  And for God's sake man, when the party suggests you change the decorations every now and again to something a bit more in the community's tastes it's not a fucking statement about *his tastes* - it's about *our tastes.*  We've seen this guy melt down as the party host for r/mma, and he's stressing out in the same way here.  Maybe it's time for him to stop hosting parties.  Because while I really love this one, I'm certainly not inviting my friends.",,False,self,t5_2qhk0,False,,,True,t3_icyzb,http://www.reddit.com/r/prowrestling/comments/icyzb/the_situation_with_the_moderator_discuss/,

You have the best roster in wrestling right now. Instead of spending time researching what WWE is doing and then copying/counteracting it (see: 2.23.11 videos/Sting - WWE dropping wrestling/TNA overcompensating, and many other examples) why not try to be innovative and worry about your own company. It's great to SAY you are a wrestling company, but why not actually execute it correctly. Coherent storylines about wins and losses, continuity in storylines, people not turning every 2 months...this will mean Wrestling Matters to you!

1302805122.0,29,self.prowrestling,gq3gz,"A memory of Adam Copeland, aka Edge, one of the best there ever was, forced to retire by injuries this week",inkslave,33,4,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/prowrestling/comments/gq3gz/a_memory_of_adam_copeland_aka_edge_one_of_the/,"Adam Copeland, the 37-year-old Canadian who wrestles for WWE as Edge, announced Monday that a serious spinal condition is forcing him to retire from the ring, effective immediately.

I've been a wrestling fan for my entire life. I know it's fake. I also know that it's not as fake as most people think. These guys are strong as hell, quick as hell and yes, they get hurt.

Edge recently returned after tearing an Achilles tendon clean off the bone a while back. He was playing heel when he left, beating up on the likes of Jeff Hardy and The Undertaker. He came back as a face, to a tremendous reception by fans.

Edge is 6-foot-5, a lean 240 pounds, has long, wild blonde hair and the best insane/raging/lunatic wide-eyed stare in the business. Over the years he has specialized in some of the more insane gimmick matches WWE has to offer, such as the infamous tables/ladders/chairs match which, well, even if you've never seen one, I bet you can guess what they're like.

But in my opinion some of his best matches ever, and some of the best professional wrestling matches in the history of the sport, were his ""straight"" matches against equally talented opponents.

Exhibit A would be his match for the World Heavyweight Championship three years ago at Wrestlemania 24, where he faced the best wrestler since Bruno Sammartino, The Undertaker. These guys closed the show and that's the way it should have been. Nobody could have followed that performance.

Taker is 6-foot-8 and when he's lean, goes about 290 (I know, he's billed as taller and heavier, but I have met him). Late in the match there came a couple of spots where Edge, off balance, had to lift Taker clean off the mat and toss him. Try that for yourself on a consenting adult who weighs 150, and then imagine trying it on someone literally twice that size, on a live pay-per-view seen by millions, in a stadium packed with tens of thousands of screaming fans, after you've been busting your butt for 30 minutes. It was nothing short of astonishing to see.

When Edge went down with the Achilles injury I thought we might have seen the last of him. When he came back I wrote him a letter congratulating him and wishing him the best, which I would bet he never read, because it was probably one of thousands just like it that he received.

Shortly thereafter, he came to my town. He was playing face at that point, and I have video I took with my little point-and-shoot camera of him jawing with Chris Jericho and pinning the Miz.

What I did not record, but what I will always remember, is what happened after the Miz match. Edge broke character, leaned against the ring ropes and talked for a couple of minutes. He apologized to the audience ""if I look a little rusty"" because he was still getting back into shape after the layoff and rehab. He called fan favorites Matt Hardy and Kane tot he ring and shook their hands ""because I haven't been too nice to you guys lately,"" a nice mix of kayfabe and reality that I admired.

He even offered Kane, a gigantic monster of a man who is probably the strongest guy in the business, a Tic Tac.

And then he looked up into the crowd and thanked us for coming and said, ""Did you all have a good time? Because that is what it's really all about. Did you have a good time?"" Cue thunderous ovation. Yes, we had a good time.

I had a good time watching Edge from start to finish. I am deeply saddened that he will no longer be able to do what I know he loves to do, and what he is one of the very best at doing.

I wish I could shake his hand, buy him a cold one and thank him personally, but there would be a very long line of people ahead of me for a chance like that.

So I'll settle for redditing.

Goodbye, Edge. Good luck, Mr. Copeland. I hope you find a good path to walk from here.

I hate how it gets shit on all the time from people who didn't watch it and just take WWE's word for it in stupid documentaries such as 'The Rise and Fall' which was a terrible DVD, as well as the more recent bullshit WCW DVD that just came out. How can you even enjoy the matches on there without the backstory leading to it?


But man, I was a huge WCW fan.

Syxx
The luchadors...
Any other Ex-WWE star 
There was really nothing to dislike. Especially in the earlier Nitro days when it was 3 hours long, every Monday (which was amazing). 

People complain ""Well, they didn't push anyone"". Fuck you! Just because someone wasn't in the main event didn't mean they weren't popular and they didn't mean anything. To those that think only the main eventer ever mean something, again, shuttup with your ignorance.

I stopped watching WCW in the middle of 99. But man, it was amazing. I can still go back and watch old matches. Syxx vs Flair, Scot Hall vs most people. The shoot style interviews, the fun you could tell people were having was just a blast.

You pay $25 to get in and have the opportunity to spend even more money to buy more shit (there are some panels, but there's a chance of being locked out). After that I'll have to pay another $40 if I want a pic with James Marsters and $30 for one with Juliet Landau or maybe another $40 for the ""headliner"" which is the Cheerleader from Heroes. This will at best include an exchange of a few words before I'm hurried off like some rodent so that the next person can get their picture.

The wrestling show I'm going tothat night: $10 to get in ($15 for front row which is only about 3 feet back from the ring). 4 hours of wrestling featuring some of the best wrestlers in the world, period. I'll get to talk to any wrestlers I want to for a bit without being harrassed. If I want a picture many won't charge, especially if you buy some reasonably priced merch ($5 8x10, $15 double disc DVD). Maybe Colt will be a couple of bucks for a pic, but he'll throw in a free joke or put down.

1314887647.0,21,self.prowrestling,k1c0q,Is anyone else a little confused by the current CM Punk/HHH/Nash angle?,dog_eat_dog,26,5,76,http://www.reddit.com/r/prowrestling/comments/k1c0q/is_anyone_else_a_little_confused_by_the_current/,"I'm not going to dump all over the angle, because I think it's probably still early, and they're not even close to doing all that they're going to do with it. 

My reason for confusion is this:

I don't think the crowd really knows what the hell is going on, or who to cheer for. It would seem that CM Punk is the apparent babyface in the situation. HHH is the reasonable yet unpredictable C.O.O. Nash is the 3rd party who is doing the dirty work. 

The issue is that I feel the crowd is confused. The crowd cheers CM Punk sometimes, yet a lot of the crowd does not agree with his ""things need to change"" stance. That shit is directed to most of us, the IWC. The current crowd is still eating things up. 
The crowd cheers HHH even more. He seems to be becoming a bigger part of this angle than Punk is, which is sort of no surprise. 
Sometimes, the crowd cheered Nash. 

**THE CROWD CHEERED FOR KEVIN NASH**

He couldn't get over as a babyface half the time, and now when he's a heel, he's getting more cheers. 

It may still be super early with this, but I think they need to make a move to define it immediately, before it becomes too watered down and loses its focus. If the intent is to establish Punk as the babyface who fights authority, and have HHH/Nash be the authority, do it at the next PPV. 

I'm not a giant Punk fanboi, but I do think he's very talented. I think his hard work is being dissipated too much right now, because no one really knows what anyones' intentions are.

He very well might be taking some time off, but I believe 100% he will remain under contract.  So here's what I think will happen.

CM Punk will beat John Cena and win the title.  The MitB winner(not making any predictions here) will then come out and cash in the same night.  But they will lose, making it the first time this has happened with MitB.  

Punk will leave with the title, and hold it hostage all summer.  WWE will spend the summer trying to figure what do to and probably hold a tournament with the winner being the new champ going after the belt with a new design.  Towards the end/after the winner is crowned Punk will come back with the belt he won at MitB and will claim he's still champ setting up and an angle where they fight to declare the true champ.  If they wanted it to be epic they'd end it at Mania.  But I don't see this going anywhere past Rumble at the very longest.

I've been working my way through some of the instant play stuff WWE has been adding to Netflix (the Steamboat one, the Hart Family one, the WrestleMania one, The Rise and Fall of WCW, the Bobby Heenan one) ... specifically the Heenan, Mania, and Rise and Fall DVD's I've noticed WWE's instance of continually burying WCW and making Vince look like some sort of wrestling God.

I know, ""der dude obviously""... yeah I know, but it still sticks in my craw a little bit when I'm sitting there watching the WrestleMania DVD and they're making it sound like Vince created the idea of a supercard on closed circuit. Hi... I'm the NWA, ever seen Starrcade? Yeah. NWA did the closed circuit thing in '83. But thanks to the WWE way back machine it was all Vince.

I'm not saying WCW didn't have problems, especially near the end. But, like in the Heenan DVD made mention of WCW for maybe a couple minutes and made it out to be some sort of hell hole. The amount of insanely good wrestling that came out of WCW from '89 to like '95, '96 is startling... to gloss over that, to make it seem as though all WCW was was the cluster fuck it was in early 2000 is a travesty of pro wrestling history.

Yeah, the combo stab in the heart that was (most of) Eric Bischoff's booking and the Time Warner merger combined just raped WCW. They stripped away its identity and released and / or misused all the young talent that made WCW in the early to mid 90's so amazing (Austin, Pillman, Liger, Vader, Cactus Jack, Guerrero, Benoit, Malenko, etc.) All the more reason to loath Eric Bischoff (he's doing it again with TNA which I find hilarious)... WCW was fucked up, but hate the rapist not the raped.

WCW at one point had one of the most stacked, talen6ted rosters ever assembled. I recommend folks look back at early WCW not through Vince's shit tinted glasses but with an unbiased eye... I really think most would be pleased with what they find.

WWE did not invent the wheel, young wrestling fans... expand your horizons.",,False,self,t5_2qhk0,False,,,True,t3_htu2g,http://www.reddit.com/r/prowrestling/comments/htu2g/does_anyone_really_remember_wcw/,

Personally, I just don't see it. Johnny is nowhere near the heel that Vince is, and I think his actions have been more neutral than heel. I think he's done more heel stuff towards Cena/Ryder than Punk.

*shrugs* I just don't see where all the rage is coming from that Punk has for him. It's just like the rage he had for HHH, and HHH was face/neutral.",,False,self,t5_2qhk0,False,,,True,t3_ow8bd,http://www.reddit.com/r/prowrestling/comments/ow8bd/i_think_cm_punks_beef_with_big_johnny_is/,

It was the best promo that I've heard on TV in years. Can't say it was the definitive 'best ever' but it ranks among the best that I can recall. Steve Austin, who cut some memorable promos in his day, was extremely impressed with Punk's work as were several other great promo men such as JBL and Mick Foley.""

""Normally when a talent is extremely passionate about a topic or an issue and speaks from their heart and not from a memorized document, the promo has a fighting chance at being stellar.""

""The first thing that must be in place for a promo to be great is that it must be natural ala from the heart and not from memory plus the talent must believe in what they are saying and not simply verbally filling time. Every promo must have a reason for taking place much akin to why most matches occur especially on PPV or in TV main events""

""Talking on a wrestling show should be special, and that means all talk, and with the special meaning that all talk should have a purpose. Too much talk for talk's sake waters down the product, slows the process and disconnects with many viewers especially when it is obvious that the talents that are talking are not skilled and/or are simply reciting what they've memorized.""

""Punk says that he is leaving after the MITB Ladder Match PPV in Punk's hometown of Chicago in July. He also says he's leaving WWE with the WWE Title. Those two elements certainly should make for some compelling TV on Monday Night Raw. Whether Punk wins or doesn't win the WWE Title is a hill I choose not to die upon but Punk staying in WWE is something that I personally hope happens in some shape, form or fashion. punk has as much to say about that eventual decision as anyone and as we have seen if one can predict what Punk's going to do next then take those instincts to Vegas and make some big money.""

""Punk's promo was reminiscent of the Attitude Era but it was totally PG. PG can be edgy but it doesn't need to travel an uncreative, low road to be attitudinal or cool. ""

--------------

That last bit is so important. When I hear people whining about the PG rating being what's killing WWE I just sigh and laugh. WWE's problem isn't their status as a PG program its that their product is most of the time just poorly written slapstick and fart jokes ... there are TONS of PG shows that are smart, well written, classy, exciting, etc. without being crass or nasty.",,False,self,t5_2qhk0,False,,,True,t3_icoj0,http://www.reddit.com/r/prowrestling/comments/icoj0/jim_ross_comments_on_punks_promo_talking_on/,

1308797981.0,16,self.prowrestling,i6t13,"The WWE ""Superstars"" Dilemma.  (The show, not the entire roster)",Micfly213,19,3,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/prowrestling/comments/i6t13/the_wwe_superstars_dilemma_the_show_not_the/,"It really irks me that during a time when there a large number of people on the WWE roster (reason the brand split was initiated in the first place), the talent pool depth on both the Raw and Smackdown! rosters are so thin that several versions of the same match occur week in and week out.  For several months repeatedly.  This probably helps to create the sense of stagnation and boredom that many feel while watching WWE currently.

I feel part of the problem lays in WWE Superstars.  Yes, the WWE.com -exclusive (here Stateside) show.

Before you laugh, I really feel like WWE has booked themselves into a convenient niche with Superstars, and it's really affecting the rest of the roster.

Now a few years ago, WWE conveniently was able to book three rosters, and only had to shuffle around a few names.   During this time, Superstars was introduced to feature ""extra"" matches, that were seemingly left off that week's show.

Fast forward 2 years, and Superstars seemingly has its own roster of people.   Which one would say is similar to ECW, except that the show has absolutely no direction, features many of the same matches, interbrand matches for little or no reason, and absolutely no progression.  Wrestlers* who win one week, will lose the next.  If there's a rematch, odds are that the other guy will win.  And the entire program has little to no recognition outside of those who watch it.  Hell, I'm pretty sure guys have entirely turned only to turn back the next week. (Primo, I'm looking at you.)

And on top of it, WWE has all of these wrestlers* on Superstars who they've gotten so used to booking on the show, that they have zero credibility.    I think it goes like this personally:

Raw side:  Zack Ryder, Chris Masters, Tyler Reks, Evan Bourne, Jack Swagger, Drew McIntyre, JTG, David Hart Smith, Goldust

Smackdown! side: Tyson Kidd, Trent Barreta, Yoshi Tatsu, Chavo Guerrero

There are other ones that have recently been more featured on the main shows including Justin/Heath, Usos, Santino, Kozlov..but the point remains the same.

My problem is that these guys are booked on Superstars so often that:

1)  I'm pretty sure nobody recognizes these guys when they're featured on the main shows.
2)  Nobody expects them to last 3 minutes.
3)  These guys are struggling to just make it on the main show, even for 5 seconds cameos. (Woo Woo Woo!)

I propose a simple solution:  Feature these guys on the main programs.  Shuffle it around more often....instead of featuring the same tag matches, through these guys into the mix.  YOU HAVE THEM ON THE ROSTER.  What's the point of having Chris Masters if he has literally spent the LAST TWO YEARS doing dark matches and only appeared on the main shows two times? (To so little fanfare, fans looked confused as to where he had been.)

It just baffles me how WWE's booking is so damn lazy, that they pretty much hit the shuffle button for every week's Superstars matches.  If you featured the guys in competitive matches, it would be better for business.  I realize that not every guy can look credible, but what's the point of promoting wrestling as a ""competition"" if pit a wrestler against a Primo.  Who the casual fan will scoff at?    It's one of those booking remnants from the Attitude Era that honestly baffles my mind.",,False,self,t5_2qhk0,False,,,True,t3_i6t13,http://www.reddit.com/r/prowrestling/comments/i6t13/the_wwe_superstars_dilemma_the_show_not_the/,

1306311461.0,16,self.prowrestling,hjms6,Rant on WWE's main event scene.,TwistedChemical,29,13,88,http://www.reddit.com/r/prowrestling/comments/hjms6/rant_on_wwes_main_event_scene/,"Randy Orton and John Cena. These guys are who you think about in this day and age when you think about WWE. The top stars and have been since 2005. Randy Orton with his Legend Killer upbringing to John Cena rapping his way to the top.

I'm not sure about all of you here, but I've never bought these guys as 'main eventers'. These 2 men have been the worst 'Main Event' attractions since I've been a wrestling fan.

When I think of Main Event attractions for WWE. I think of the crazy promo's of Hulk Hogan where he gave off so much energy, it felt like you were watching a Rocky montage that just pumped you (Warrior also). I think of Shawn Michaels emotional and long journey to the top. I think of the mysteries of Sting. The powerful Goldberg ripping people apart without any reason. Brock Lesnars destructive path with Paul Heyman as his voice. Eddie Guerrero and his INSANE cheating antics that would make you laugh everytime you saw him in a match. But what happened after this?

You would get won over by each and every one of these guys. They had something about them that caused you to care for them and want to see them win whenever they were in the WWE ring. True main eventers that would have the world tune in to watch them (not just kids)

To me, Randy Orton and John Cena aren't main eventers because they can't connect with their audience and they never could. From the very beginning it has felt as if they were forced into the main event because WWE really didn't have anyone else to go with...But they weren't just pushed into the main event, they were pounded into the show. You had to like these guys because they never lost. They held the title and hoped the crowd would cheer their little hearts away, but it never really worked like that. It's crazy to think back when ECW One Night Stand was happening that John Cena was just as hated as he is today, yet YEARS later, he's doing the exact same thing he was then. There's no depth, there's no personality, just smiles and colors.

This is why I feel WWE decided to target kids as their audience. With kids being their target audience they can put on the worst most bland shows in existence and kids would eat it up because John Cena smiles and wears bright colors. That's really ALL this guy has. He certainly doesn't connect with the older audience and neither does Randy Orton.

The 'Creative Team' haven't put any thought into any of these characters for years. John Cena doesn't even have a main 'heel' to compete against and he hasn't since 2008. His opponents have ALWAYS been 'superstars' that were shot into the main event without any character made for themselves (or it's seemed that way 90 percent of the time). But without a main villain, there's nothing to maintain 'face'. There's no character there, other than the occasional Miz (who I have to give credit for as they actually tried to make him a deeper heel) that just comes along, loses and is done for.

**TL;DR**- WWE's main event scene is terrible. There are no true heels, which make the faces seem almost pointless for existing. I think WWE are targeting kids because they just don't know how to make interesting or edgy characters anymore.

'An update on Jinsei Shinzaki. He has two ramen noodle restaurants in Sendai, which is near the epicenter of the earthquake. Both were damaged but they are both back operational. He is not living in his car, although he sort of has been. He’s been driving nine to ten hours daily since the earthquake. His supplier is in Tokushima, and he gets his supplies daily shipped from Tokushima to Niigata. He then drives daily to Niigata to pick up supplies. He also brings ramen soup and cooks it up at shelters on a daily basis. He goes to shelters and allows people to eat all the ramen noodles they can, and said he’s been serving up more than 300 bowls daily at different shelters to people who have lost their homes in the earthquake. For many, it’s the first hot meal they’ve had since the earthquake. 

He said, it’s “a great day for ramen chef.” Michinoku Pro Wrestling, the company he works for, is touring Kyushu, a Southern island, since they can’t do much in their normal territory. Shinzaki opted out of the tour because he had to drive so much to keep his restaurant open and to feed the homeless. Sho Funaki is on the Michinoku Pro tour.'",,False,self,t5_2qhk0,False,,,True,t3_gacyf,http://www.reddit.com/r/prowrestling/comments/gacyf/jinsei_shinzaki_doing_his_bit/,

1310725387.0,14,self.prowrestling,iqaz6,"Ancient Greek WWE: CM Punk, John Cena and Vince McMahon as Protagonist, Deuteragonist and Tritagonist",JTFirefly,20,6,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/prowrestling/comments/iqaz6/ancient_greek_wwe_cm_punk_john_cena_and_vince/,"While thinking about the current storyline of CM Punk et al., I started to realize that this could be an ancient Greek drama unfolding.

It's nothing new that wrestling borrows from classical mythology and storytelling (the battle between Good and Evil - Face versus Heel). But the current set-up deviates considerably from these usual plots: 

* CM Punk is clearly the protagonist of the story. He's the one proactively chasing the title, and seeks to demonstrate his superior in-ring ability against the ""ass-kissers"". While he's not a Face by any means, his struggle (while potentially futile), consider this: ""a sense of empathy about the character's objectives and emotions is what the audience feels toward the protagonist"" ([Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protagonist))

* John Cena seems to be the [deuteragonist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuteragonist): ""The deuteragonist may switch from being with or against the protagonist depending on the deuteragonist's own conflict/plot."" He's Punk's opponent, but at the same time he's showing him respect, and even helped him to lift the suspension.

* That leaves Vince McMahon in the role of the [tritagonist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tritagonist): ""As a character, a tritagonist may act as the instigator or cause of the sufferings of the protagonist. Despite being the least sympathetic character of the drama, he occasions the situations by which pity and sympathy for the protagonist are excited."" He's the one focusing on ""entertainment"", not wrestling, and he's the one favoring the ""ass-kissers"".

That's it in a nutshell. This isn't my field of expertise though, so I could be totally off. And even if I'm right, I'm not sure if this would help to form a theory where the plot's going. Still, I thought that the whole protagonist/deuteragonist/tritagonist is a good fit for the three characters. Could this have been intentional? Or is this nothing new?",,False,self,t5_2qhk0,False,,,True,t3_iqaz6,http://www.reddit.com/r/prowrestling/comments/iqaz6/ancient_greek_wwe_cm_punk_john_cena_and_vince/,

* Fix the women's division. Hire Kong, Del Rey, Melissa, and one or two Joshi. Fire all of the models including NXT girls besides Laycool, but put them on notice. Natty wins the title and holds it for a while.
* HHH never holds another title belt of any sort.
* Make Bourne and Gabriel your MCMG and do with them what you should have done with London and Kendrick.
* Fire Hornswoggle and repackage any comedy only acts.
* Shut Cole up and fire the person who decided having him bury talented on every show was a good idea.
* Burn the FCW gym to the ground. No good can come of it. No one WWE hires should need any serious training. They should only be taking the best of the best.
* Fire creative team. Hire Heyman and/or Sapolsky.
* Next Tough Enough should be exactly like The Ultimate Fighter, with teams and actual stars as coaches. The show should be built entirely around putting Tyler Black over. It's not hard to keep the kayfabe going on something like this either.
* Turn Cena heel, FFS. Even if it's for 3 months it would freshen up things for years for him.
* No one cuts a 20 minute promo unless they are CM Punk.
* No more unrealistic storylines, at all. Undertaker doesn't get to be a special exception especially when he's going to MMA events while he's ""dead.""
* No more unrealistic match stipulations. The only one who should ever be in a handicap match is Big Show. Cena, let alone Shane McMahon, should never be able to beat back 3 guys.
* No more guest hosts unless they are actual, legit, near A level stars. Having C-graders on their hocking movies just makes the WWE look cheap in comparison.

(discussion),dog_eat_dog,19,6,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/prowrestling/comments/ihcj0/dont_apologize_for_working_heel_should_wrestling/,"After watching the recent video of CM Punk arguing with a fan, and his subsequent apology, I got to thinking....

At what point did the general media and non-wrestling fans start taking things more seriously than WE do? I understand that we live in an age where we try not to offend people. I understand and support that. The issue is, at what point did wrestling start being judged as if it were legitimate people and their legitimate feelings or actions? 
I totally understand that the word ""homo"" is offensive to some. It would be offensive to me as well if I heard it used as a legitimate slur in a public place. The issue is, CM Punk and his character are meant to offend. They are supposed to irritate and offend on a level that an evil king/crooked prison guard/racist  in a film is meant to offend, so that you openly wish for him to meet a cruel end. If CM Punk does things that are irritating or offensive, people will want to see him lose. They'll want to see him lose in a glorious fashion, and hopefully bleed, as well. 

Remember when JBL/Bradshaw got in deep shit for the Hitler salute in Germany during his tag match? That was probably farther than most would have taken it, and it IS offensive, but it's not as if there wasn't a lesson being taught in the long run. People forget that. In its purest form, wrestling is the magnification of real life characters in competition, with people that you would like and not like. Heels get what's coming to them in most cases. Lessons are learned. 

The Heels in wrestling are basically having their tools taken away from them. 
I remember reading a description of a certain night in Japan as told by Dynamite Kid. He was working heel, and during his entrance to the ring, a young guy had slapped him on the back a bit too hard, just being a brat and testing the wrestlers. Dynamite ripped him over the railing, ripped off his shirt, slammed him on the ground, and stomped on him. Legitimately. He DEFINITELY took it too far and spent the night in jail, and was later bailed out by the promoter. 

But who or what was responsible for the instant sellout show that took place the next night?

Former ROH Tag Team Champions Chris Hero and Claudio Castagnoli were at both the Monday Night Raw and Smackdown tapings this past week in New York and Rhode Island. According to a report by PWInsider.com, the tag team worked out in the ring with WWE officials before each show.

No other details are known at this time.""

I got this from www.gerweckn.net, my usual site for information on pro wrestling (aside from r/prowrestling of course) and if this is true, this is potentially **HUGE NEWS!** Hero and Castagnoli in the WWE would be epic, if used correctly of course, either as singles superstars or in a tag team. The possibilities are endless.

Someone on gerweck compared the possible WWE signing of the Kings of Wrestling to the Dudley Boys being signed. ECW was on the verge of a major TV deal and Vince went ahead and signed there tag team champions. Just like ROH is on the verge of a major step toward national exposure and then the WWE goes and gives one of their premiere tag teams a tryout.

Admittedly, when it comes to modern-day stuff, I'm probably not pursuing the correct things. I should probably be watching more Chikara/ROH and the like. So maybe I'm overlooking something in those promotions. 
Anyways, I've noticed that through the years, the role of a Jobber changed drastically, and eventually was phased out when it comes to major wrestling promotions. I feel this may pose an issue, and here's why:

Whenever a new guy comes in that needs to be pushed to the moon, the only options nowadays in WWE/TNA are to:

* Have the guy wrestle these usual drone matches like most of the matches on the show. Heat--comeback--win sort of deal. No one really looks great. It's just a simple match. 

* The new guy crushes his opponent, which due to the fact that EVERYONE on the roster is made to look like somewhat of a big deal, the opponent gets buried. 

In either scenario, someone isn't really going to be used to their fullest potential. 
I'm not saying that the WWE/TNA needs to fire half of their roster and sub-contract some Mulkey's or something, but you could easily book some of the lesser used guys as ""enhancement talent"" and still have them appear regularly on TV programs. Maybe they win a match against another jobber at some point. Maybe you decide they're actually pretty decent, and you give them a ""1-2-3 Kid"" type Scenario. 

Just imagine for a second, that a monster heel like Yokozuna arrives and has to immediately work a give-and-take against someone else? He needs to crush people. I don't see any other way. 

Given, I love old Crockett/WCW/NWA TV tapings, but that is the other extreme where EVERYONE is killing a jobber. That's probably too much. At the same time though, at least everyone was getting over by efficiently killing opponents.

If you have any interest in wrestling at all, trust me, they are an awesome night out and well worth the 5 - 10 quid entrance.  Most of the venues have drink for sale so it's a great start to an evening.

They've always had good wrestlers but the direction nowadays feels both manic and depressive.  Manic in that, they're pushing extremes, going with more mature content, but depressive in that there's no real hook to the storylines to get me interested.  

They have got 3 hours to fill on thursday nights.  That's a lot of time to build stuff up.  And yet it doesn't feel like anything is going anywhere.  Or should I say that anything is building up to something big.  It just kind of keeps going and going.  It makes me sad because I really used to enjoy it 9-12 months back.

I find the main storyline of TNA a bit interesting, that of hogan and his cronies ruining it, but everyone else on the roster seems to have little to no storyline.  

WWE does a lot less hardcore but has superior storylines as of late.  Why?  Because they're giving more of their roster more opportunities to shine in storylines.  It's not just centered around one main event rivalry to the exclusion of all others.

But anyways, I'd like to hear what you have to say about what needs to be done to make TNA a better show.  What would you do different?",,False,self,t5_2qhk0,False,,,True,t3_dxla0,http://www.reddit.com/r/prowrestling/comments/dxla0/if_they_brought_you_in_to_fix_tna_what_would_you/,

I definitely talk down about the current product a bit. A lot of us do. I think we have decent reasons to do so. The current main event picture in both main promotions is muddled. The midcard is usually ignored, and the guys aren't really allowed or able to work in the fashion that they'd like. The womens division is not working. 

When I go back and watch complete episodes of RAW from 98 or so, I started to notice things. Sure, you see great moments and angles that lived on and are still talked about today. Austin, Rock, Taker, New Age Outlaws, all that stuff. Yet, for every memorable angle, there would be some midcard matches that went nowhere. Tag matches with teams that never got over. If you go back further, you start seeing Duke the Dumpster or Marc Mero in PPV matches. 

WCW was the same. For every Goldberg/DDP/Jericho, there were plenty of guys like Van Hammer that were around for YEARS that were involved in time wasters, or allowed to flounder. 

I guess I noticed that I'm pretty guilty or idealizing wrestling of the past. I think most of us are. We remember great angles with Austin, and talk about how wrestling was so great then, but there were matches with the Godwinns on the same show. 

Now I'm not making excuses for the current product, but I feel like I forget what it felt like to watch RAW/NITRO from front to back at that time.

Early on, a match is announced, Santino vs. Ted DiBiase.
As Santino is headed to the ring, a masked and hooded wrestler just TAKES him out, I mean hardcore and then sprints to the back. 
Zach Ryder is shoved out to take on Ted DiBiase and (wha???) Wins??? 
 
Beth Phoenix absolutely destroys Kelly Kelly. Natalya Neidhart joins in for a post-match beatdown. Refs have to pull them off, HHH comes out and threatens suspension.
 
Cee-Lo Green Concert, he gets off ""Bright Lights, Bigger City"" is about to go into the next song when the masked and hooded wrestler takes HIM out. Now the announcers are in a state of confusion and chaos.
 
Emergency match is called to fill time. R-Truth vs. Dolph Ziggler, Dolph is about to win when the hooded and masked wrestler charges the ring and goes after Vicki. distracting Dolph enough to get Lie Detectored, Truth wins.
 
Main Event. Classic match ensues, Towards the end it is becoming more and more apparent that HHH is siding with Cena and the corporation over Punk. Towards the end of the match, HHH slow counts a 2.9999999 on Cena. Chaos envelops the ring as Punk goes ballistic on HHH. HHH kicks Punk and goes for the Pedigree when Cena stops him and asks what the hell he thinks he's doing. SUDDENLY, the hooded and masked wrestler hits the ring, BLASTING HHH in the back of the head, knocking him out. Punk GTS on Cena, emergency ref comes out and hits the three count. Punk retains!
 
Post Match. Mystery Wrestler squares off against Punk, and then takes off the hood and the mask. IT'S THE MIZ! IT WAS THE MIZ THE WHOLE TIME! LEGENDARY Cena beatdown commences with Punk and the Miz. A few faces hit the ring to help Cena, Let's say Kofi, A-Ry, Mysterio, Zach Ryder, even R-Truth. These guys square off against Punk and the mystery wrestler, when suddenly R-Truth and Zach Ryder just start going nuts on Kofi, A-Ry and Mysterio. The beat down is epic, even Beth Phoenix comes to the ring and gets her some. When everyone is laid out Punk grabs the mic.
 
""Oh Hunter... or may I call you Jean-Paul? The days of the goofy, pretty, sideshow, blonde haired, singing, no-talent freaks are over, now beings the era of the wrestler, now beigins the era of the Cult... of... Personality!""
 
***LOOK IN MY EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEYES! WHAT DO YOU SEE???""

I can see the Kings coming in like The Outsiders/DX did and taking the tag titles quickly, especially with the likes of Kane and Big Show ""out with injuries"" they would probably be one of the larger tag teams in the WWE. Then you get Cabana on the mic and have him interfering in matches in favor of the Kings while Micheal Cole does his ""indy darlings"" rant thing. Debut Seth Rollins to a Smackdown crowd and win the IC title and tie in some sort of angle where Danielson ""approves"" of Rollins' claiming the title and sell some conspiracy between the two. In the end Punk would come back at the pleading of The New Nexus after being unable to win back the tag titles, or any titles, only to be squashed by the Kings and Punk (no one would miss Nexus anyway). 

Then the Kings and Punk head over to Smackdown and reveal that Rollins is on their side and Danielson doesn't ""approve"" of that until he cashes in his MITB and then does an about face to join Punk and crew. With both World titles, tag titles and the IC title in their stable they go on to recruit guys like Evan Bourne (the Waltman/high flyer of the group), keep Cabana as a Rick Rude type of ""insurance"" guy and throw in Zach Ryder so he can get the attention he deserves. ""Woo woo woo"" can be the new ""Hey, yo!""

Pairing Rollins with someone for his debut would be really good since he promo skills are lacking. He's the Mark Jackson of the wrestling world, all cliche phrases and no substance. Cabana's exposure at MITB speaks for itself while everyone else makes for a believable indy invasion angle. 

The WWE would be the Sherwood Forest to CM Punk's Robin Hood. His stable of merry men would take from the rich (take gold titles in this case) and give to the poor (underutilized talent and also great matches for the fans).

But the facts show that PPV buyrates are down and television ratings are down, and while I can't speak for live events, I would imagine they would be on par with their TV and PPV counterparts.

Everyone knows that WWE takes their product very seriously during the January-April, Rumble-Mania season, but quite frankly, the Summers suck. They couldn't even be bothered to promote MITB [without making a mockery of it, as Jason Powell so aptly pointed out.](http://www.prowrestling.net/artman/publish/powellsblog/article10019134.shtml) 

We all know Summerslam is a major event and Money in the Bank is a huge PPV, but honestly, would anyone miss the May, June, July Pay-Per-View slots? I say move MITB to November, in place of Survivor Series (which has been in jeopardy of being replaced for years). 

The product has clearly been weaker during the summer months, so why not give the Wrestlers a **much needed** off-season and take the summer off? They could rest their bodies, be with their families, improve their overall health and come back in better shape for the fall. 

I want to hear your reasons why you do, or don't agree that WWE needs an off-season.

Obviously, given what's transpired since, those people were very wrong about most of that. WWE's making the same mistakes they've made for the past several years. I mean could there have been a better indication of that than HHH pinning CM Punk in the middle of the ring (after hitting his finisher, no less)?

The problems with the WWE haven't been fixed and won't be fixed. What has changed is their willingness to acknowledge the complaints fans have, on TV and online. Punk's promo could have been cut and pasted from any wrestling fan board. Ditto the initial bits of the Divas of Destruction Angle. There's been articles about the Divas thing basically highlighting complaints fans have had about the women's division for some time, and there was one posted here recently where WWE basically plagiarized everything fans had to say negatively about the Cena/Rock/Miz/Truth plotholes.

Yet, none of these problems will actually be fixed. HHH increased his role in WWE. WWE continues to hire untrained models as to wrestle for them while ignoring amazingly talented, marketable women like Sara Del Rey and LuFisto. The plot-holes are going to be just as bad this month as last month as next month as the months after and before. But, by merely giving lip service to them, WWE throws skeptical fans the scraps they need in order to keep putting up with it.

For lack of a better term, nods to Royal, it's the ""smarkbait"" era. Much like a politician, WWE will let you know they've heard you, while promising nothing and delivering less.",,False,self,t5_2qhk0,True,,,True,t3_m4s66,http://www.reddit.com/r/prowrestling/comments/m4s66/the_real_new_era_in_wwe/,

I try to catch it every so often basically to feel like I'm doing my civic duty as a fan and giving everyone a fair shake. 

I watched the end of last night's show, and I just gotta say, Kurt Angle's body looks like absolute trash. I'm not saying that he looks like he needs to train harder or something. I'm saying that he looks like he's very ill, yet training to compensate for that. His body shape does not look natural at all. Unless maybe he was on PE Drugs before and has since completely backed off, I feel like the only logical reason for it is that his body is breaking down. We're aware that he's had pill issues due to the injuries and such, but this goes even deeper than that. 

When he was on his game in like 1999-2001 or so, I think he was one of the best guys in the business. He kept that era (early 2000's) interesting for longer than it may have been without him. I have a TON of respect for the guy, but I feel like something is horribly wrong. Beyond the pill thing. Beyond the drunk driving thing. I'm talking about strung-out kind of bad.

My personal suggestions are: 

* **Arrows.** To have no down vote arrows for posts. Too many people are downvoting posts based on cyncism of either indie wrestling or large promotional wrestling. Wrestling is wrestling no matter where it's found. I personally try to enjoy most of it and stay open minded, but judging by the new queue on this subreddit I don't think that's happening overall.

* **Promotion-neutral style sheet** I think the subreddit should have have more of a neutral style sheet. It's well known that JohnHyperion (the moderator) likes wrestling a certain way and the subreddit's style sheet reflects those personal tastes.  And this is fine.. whilst the subreddit is small, as the mod had the foresight to create the community in the first place. And it's always been a well moderated and good looking little subreddit.

* But as the community grows Perhaps a completely promotion-neutral theme would be more appealing to people on their first visit. My first impression was ""great wrestling elitism at it's finest"". I'm not just saying that either, that's honestly what I thought. And for a while I was sceptical of how balanced the community would be, but in general it's OK.

* **Topical banner pic?** Perhaps a wrestling themed alien in the top left? and a topical picture in the top right based on what's current like they do over at /r/soccer. Such as a month ago it could have been a picture of Randy Savage. It should be said though that in general the style sheet is attractive.



* **Addition of moderators** Also this is an open question to JohnHyperion Raising the point about mods. As a subreddit grows it's important to ensure it's *viewed as* a balanced and user friendly environment, not suggesting it is or isn't either way, but more moderators as the subreddit grows is an important display of a fair moderation and balance.

I follow it somewhat loosely because I enjoy it.  I don't know why I enjoy it, but I do.  But lately, any time Michael Cole opens his mouth I get angry.  I get this deep seeded, pit of the stomach anger and I want to change the channel.  I was enjoying Raw tonight until his stupid ass showed up.  I understand giving him all the heat you can to build up to a wrestlemania match, but they didn't even execute that correctly.  The crowd got its satisfaction only to have it taken away instantly by the stupidest call I have EVER seen in my life.  It makes no sense for the writers to do that.  So what do we get?  We get a storyline, that has been wearing on the fans as it is, continued with no forseeable end in sight.

(The ticket cost me $7, btw.)

Kowalski, 250 pounds or more, had Bruno in a standard arm bar. Bruno was on one knee. Then he half-turned, grabbed Kowalski's boot at the laces with his right hand, AND STOOD UP. He walked across the ring and sat Killer on a ring post and walked away. Killer sold it like a boss, with a look of absolute shock on his face, and 22,000 fans, as one, went, ""WHOOOOOOOA."" I knew he was strong, and sure, it was worked, but I didn't know ANYONE was that strong.

What have you seen that blew your mind?

EDIT: Thanks for sharing, ring people. Awesome stories.

I also want to put in a plug for MVP and Shelton Benjamin wrestling in a Fatal 4 way with Jeff Hardy and Brian Kendrick a few years ago at a house show. Kendrick was elimiinated early. Hardy spent most of the match ""unconscious"" on the floor before coming in, hitting WITW and winning. But for 20 minutes MVP and Benjamin worked their asses off. It was a house show, not a huge crowd, and they gave it everything they had. I ran down to the walkway to shake their hands after, missed Benjamin but MVP smiled when I said, ""Thank you for busting your ass for us!""
