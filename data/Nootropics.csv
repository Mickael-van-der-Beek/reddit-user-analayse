1348666954.0,475,self.Nootropics,10i7qj,How do smart people really think?,Sherlockian_Holmes,589,114,456,http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/10i7qj/how_do_smart_people_really_think/,"I have always wondered about this, maybe because I've always been behind in school, and felt quite inadequate in general knowledge or something else like that. But how do really smart people think about stuff? I've been [un]fortunate enough to spend a lot of time around a lot of smart people, and I have always been quite inspired by their ability to come up with novel solutions, solve really hard problems easily, and come up with tangential answers and see random connections between disparate pieces of knowledge (e.g. free association).

I am pretty sure I have been brainwashed by TV-series such as House MD, Lie To Me and Prison Break to think that when highly intelligent people think about stuff, sparks are flying, so to speak. When I am reading a book for instance, I have this idea that I should be coming up with lots of associations to what I am reading, and also be seeing the scenes that are depicted extremely vividly. So when I am reading and everything is going extremely slow, and I don't sense any sparks flying, I just kind of lose interest or get fed up, and go look at the computer instead. At least there, I get to ""see"" stuff, so I don't have to use my (in my perception) underdeveloped imagination.

Please give me the no-bullshit, hard facts about how intelligent people think so I can get over these stupid, inhibitory mindsets and ideas that -- I presume -- are holding me back?

I have a feeling that because I was praised for my intelligence, and not my effort when I was young, I have developed these limiting beliefs about intelligence that have made me ""do less"" and ""expect more"", and thus ending up in a perpetual loop of self-defeat. (I seem to remember that these thoughts are supported by psychology research in deliberate practice and growth vs. limited mindset on intelligence). But maybe this idea is an inhibitory one as well... Astonishes me how I can come up with tons of ideas as to ""Why I am stupid"".

It would be interesting to see your guys definition of intelligence, because we are all here -- trying to increase it, in one way or another, through exercise or through psychotropic substances, but in either case, what do you guys think about these issues? 

Thank you.

This is a place to advance our knowledge of all nootropics, not simply beat the latest popular one to death. I understand that many of you have questions about modafinil. However, I assure you that they have all been answered before. The search function works well, please use it before asking basic questions that we have all seen 100 times. I do not want to discourage discussions. However, we should limit those discussions to trying to expand information, not regurgitate what we already know.

* Modafinil is a wakefulness promoting agent.

* Modafinil will not replace dopaminiergic stimulants for ADHD.

* Modafinil will not work for everyone.

* Both enantiomers in racemic modafinil are active.

* R-modafinil is 3 times more active.

* Generics seem to be hit or miss. Some think they are the exact same, other don't...

* Your order will take a while to get here. Don't ask us if this is a normal thing.

* Modafinil increases hypothalamic histamine. This can lead to flush-like symptoms.

* There is a 99.999999% chance that you do not have Steven Johnson's Syndrome. If you did, Reddit is not the place to figure that out.

* No, the DEA will not throw you in jail for ordering modafinil. There is a chance that DHS will confiscate your order. If you are in Canada, then there is a higher risk of it being confiscated.

* It is not a miracle drug for improving cognition. There is no such thing. I'm sorry Limitless has misled you.

So if you find any new information on modafinil that is interesting, by all means post it here so we can discuss it. Please, no more long winded anecdotes about how modafinil worked for you.

Some of the vendors approached us looking for a way to advertise here, but have the money benefit the community directly. So we came up with a plan where they could sponsor 3rd party purity testing through us. They will donate funds to an account we have set up that will be used to test nootropics from the community. For doing so, they will be recognized in the FAQ with being an /r/Nootropics supporter.

We have been complacent for too long, ingestigating substances with only manufacturer COAs. Sometimes we don't even have reliable COAs at all. Along with my upcoming objective nootropic studies, this step should bring some scientific data that we have been lacking. Yes the study is still going forward. Samples from the HSW batches that will be used in the study are being tested as we speak at the lab. Once the results are back, we can move forward with the study.

Sophie from Modup has also donated funds to test two batches of nootropics. She has been very enthusiastic about helping the community out, and we thank her for being the first to donate money to the testing fund!

Now all we need to do is determine which nootropics should be the first tested. I am leaning toward the new piracetam pills from piracet.am and perhaps the numbing choline from Cerebral Health. What does everyone think?

What I was going for during my experimentation with these drugs is the magic formula, which I will classify as a ""miracle drug"":


1) Has a significant, measurable positive effect on your daily life

2) Little to no negative side effects

3) Fairly easy to obtain (at worst, ship from Canada)

4) Fairly cheap per dosage.

5) Short time between first take and effects benefit (1 week max)

The following are the drugs I consider to be in the above category.  I am including several non-nootropic supplements because of their significance as well.

**Modafinil**

The big boss of all nootropics.  As everyone has said, it ""removes the feeling of being tired"".  Incredibly it has no side effects, and in my experiences I actually get a deeper sleep and excellent dreams as a result.  Ordering it is a bit tricky but this subreddit has good links if you search.  A bit pricey, but you don't spend more than $1 a day, for massively increased workflow.

**Piracetam/Choline**

The other big boss of nootropics.  Makes you sharper, mentally, in all scales.  No side effects.  Get both in powder form, can get it from amazon.  Tastes nasty, but be a man.

**L-Theanine**

Underrated.  Like shotgunning a green tea.  I use it as sort of a substitute for aspirin, generally whenever you feel stressed or crappy a theanine will keep you sane.  Get it from amazon.

**Caffeine**

In pill form it's unbeatable.  Great for preworkout and in general.  Fuck coffee and its calories.

**Ephedrine**

This one is tricky.  I don't think I know how to use it well.  It does make me not hungry for a few hours, but after the effect wears off all I want to do is eat.  But it's definitely one of the more effective fat burners out there.

**Creatine**

Workout staple, almost no side effects (besides random water weight gain).  Helps you get huge!

**Beta - Alanine**

A primary ingredient in Jack3D (which I consider to be a really expensive cocktail of caffeine and beta alanine).  Basically removes muscle fatigue.  Much better for lifting than running.

1362091696.0,125,self.Nootropics,19fb9t,Reddit Placebo Blinded Racetam Study,MisterYouAreSoDumb,138,13,167,http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/19fb9t/reddit_placebo_blinded_racetam_study/,"Well the time has finally come. My curiosity has finally expanded to real world effectiveness, not just pharmacological mechanisms. We are all aware of the countless anecdotes for the various nootropics out there. Many of us have based our decisions on the validity and accuracy of those anecdotes. But how do we know that the effects stated in those anecdotes are due to the racetams and not the placebo effect? How do we even know if the supposed results we are seeing in our own supplement regimen are not due to confirmation bias? We've read the anecdotes. We've read the studies. We know what the effects are supposed to be. Perhaps we are allowing the placebo effect to cloud our judgement, and blur the lines of results and expectations. Can some of us determine which racetam we were given just by the effects? Well now is the time to answer that.

This is going to be the first study in a series. Depending on how well this one goes, perhaps we will expand in the future. LiftMode has expressed interest in a study of the newest nootropics like sunfiram and colouracetam. That will most likely be our second study. This first one is being sponsored by Health Supplement Wholesalers, and will include some of the common racetams that many of you use every day. Exactly which racetams to be used will only be known by myself and a handful of other people. The box from HSW actually just arrived an hour ago. Mmmmmm, racetams.

The study is going to consist of 20 Redditors. Selection of the participants is going to be a little complex, due to the variables that I want to control. Each person that is interested in the study is going to have to give me a summary of how long they have been using racetams, what types they have been using, and how familiar they consider themselves with them. They are also going to have to take all of the free [Cambridge Science](http://www.cambridgebrainsciences.com/) tests, and send me their results. I will not make public what I am looking for in a participant until after the study has concluded. I want this to be as blinded as I possibly can.

There will be a cost associated with this study. I am donating my time for free, but there will be other costs like capsules, packaging, and shipping. Right now I think it's going to be $20 per person. I am currently ordering the capsules and capsuling equipment that will be used to create the 800 or so capsules needed for the study. I am going to use flavored, non-see-through capsules to mask the ingredients inside. I am also going to use inert masking agents in each of the capsules, as well as for the placebo control. I know that I would be able to tell aniracetam from piracetam just by looking at the capsules, and I assume many of you could as well. I want to avoid any chance that my blinding will not be effective.

It is looking like it will be a 10 day study, with 4 capsules per day taken in two doses. There is no telling which days will be active, and which days will be placebo. There is also no telling how many racetams I will use, or in what dosing schedules I will use them. Each participant will receive a package with individually marked bags corresponding to the days of the trial. They will take two pills from the bag in the morning, then the last two at mid day. They will have a spreadsheet that I have created that will allow them to track not only their subjective opinion of their mood, energy level, anxiety, and focus; but they will also take each of the Cambridge Science assessments every day to objectively test any improvements. I need some opinions on which tests would be best. Perhaps we use all of them, perhaps only a few. It's going to be somewhat time intensive for the participants, so I only want Redditors willing to ensure this study gets good data. There will be no placebo control group. Each person will get a mix of active racetams and placebo. The days are going to be our control group.

Nobody will know which racetams were used, much less what days corresponded to certain ones, until after the study has concluded. I am still on the fence about using choline. Whatever we decide, it must be consistent with each person in the study. There is also going to be a washout period. The participants are going to need to refrain from using any nootropics for at least a week. Then you will take your baseline Cambridge Science tests. If this is not done, our data will not be accurate. We want to control as many variables as possible, so that we do not have anything clouding the data. We want consistent dosing schedules, consistent testing times, and congruency among all the participants. The better prepared we are, the better our data will be.

I am going to need some help from those that are more familiar with statistics. Any volunteers would be appreciated. Anyone familiar with standard testing procedures would be good to speak to as well. I want to make sure I am not missing something that will lead to inconsistent data.

We are going to be looking for acute effects. Each dosing schedule is not going to be long enough to build up the substance. This is by design. We are also going to be testing a bunch of different things. One of which is the accuracy of subjective perception. Do you guys know how to differentiate active from placebo, and can you tell the specific racetam for that day. This is not going to be a completely scientific study, since our sample size is going to be relatively low. However, I believe this study is going to give us some really good data with all the controls we will be implementing. There are a lot of variables, and I hope I have come up with ways to control for them. Anyone that is good with that sort of thing, and wants to be sworn to secrecy about what we are doing until after the study is done, message me and I can get you involved. I want to limit exposure of our methods as much as possible, but I am going to need some help.

Lastly, this study is predicated on trusting me. You will be taking unknown pills that I have measured and capsuled. You will also be sending me money without legal guarantees. If you don't trust me, don't express interest. I have much better things to do than try and scam people for a couple hundred bucks. The time I am going to be investing in this is worth much more than that. I am also not going to poison any of you. I promise! Health Supplement Wholesalers was awesome, and sent out the racetams I requested almost instantly. Thank you to them!

Now, what does everyone think?

The effects of drugs like piracetam, choline, sulbutiamine, and caffeine are great, but seem to have an effect (almost exclusively) on receptors and neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, dopamine, and gaba. Such has previously been the case as well for drugs that treat mood and attention disorders. People are given SSRIs to increase the amount of serotonin in the synapse. Children are given Adderall to increase the amount of dopamine, among other neurotransmitters. These drugs are created to address short term issues. Again, I'm not disputing the efficacy, but there is a cap to what upping your neurotransmitters will do for your brain biochemically. One may say, once your brain chemistry is maxed, you will be better able to pay attention, stay focused, memorize, ect and then you can improve on the effects to form new habits and behaviors. That is certainly true. However, I think we can have something grander than this.

In order to make any significant, positive, long term changes to the brain itself we need to focus on drugs, nutrients, growth factors, and nootropics that physically add to or fix the structure of the brain to increase efficiency and possibly raise IQ and intelligence.  Now, this can be an extremely slippery slope when looking at the potential problems of fibrosis, overgrowth and the dangers of brain cancer as well as addressing the pruning issue. Experiments must be done (on ourselves?) to expand this new frontier in science.



In order to delineate between the short term biochemical effects I will call these drugs ""nootropic uppers"". And I will call the longterm structure changing drugs, ""nootropic benders"" I constitute a ""nootropic upper"" as a nootropic that increases a neurotransmitter to specific receptor site or play some (major) part in that biochemical action.

Here are some examples of nootropic uppers:

Precursors, Cofactors, inhibitors, Reuptake inhibitors and enhancers, Agonists - Examples:

Racetams, Vitamins and supplements, Dopaminergics, Stimulants, GABA blockers, Glutamate activators, Serotonergics, adaptogenic.



Then we have the ""nootropic benders"", These are the nootropics that presumably change the structure of the brain itself. These effects may be long term and not cause immediate, noticeable effects.

Here are some examples of nootropic benders:

I encourage members and nootropic users to think about the difference between these 2 types of nootropics.

I have a mind set which  promotes understanding of biochemical processes in order to make a more effective stack. Stacks are individualized because we all have different sensitivities and tools available. For example; I am sensitive to cholinergics and have adderall prescribed to me, however this is not true for everyone.

My proposition is this; instead of constantly posting threads such as ""This is my stack"" and ""What should I use?"", I'd like to see more research paper reviews. I posted such a review a few weeks ago explaining the primary philosophy behind the use of racetams as nootropics. It was older, however incredibly valid, and in my personal opinion the most important step in applying modern nootropic philosophy.

People were noticing that if the choline came into contact with their mouth, it would numb their tongue and throat. Obviously this is not a property of choline bitartrate, so we were concerned. I had a Redditor send me a sample to have testing done.

Before sending out for testing, I took a small amount and placed it on the tip of my tongue. Sure enough, it immediately numbed my tongue and even moved down into my throat. It was a very substantial numbing that occurred, and lasted for 10 minutes or so. So I sent a sample out to the lab to confirm if it was in fact choline bitartrate, or something else.

The lab just called me to let me know that the sample was **NOT** choline bitartrate. They said that some of the peaks matched up, so it is a similar compound. However, it would take more testing to prove exactly what it is. I feel that it is most likely choline salicylate, as that is used as an oral numbing agent. That would also explain the matching peaks on the test, since the structures would have similarities. But it is definitely not bitartrate.

The lab will be sending me the official results soon, but I wanted to make this post now, so that those of you using choline from Cerebral Health, or frankly any of their products, can have the information and decide what they wanted to do about it. I will be editing this post with a link to the full results once I get them.

I apologize if this is not ""official"" enough with citations, etc. It's a work in progress. If anyone wants to contribute, I've selected Xmind as the format, and I could host it in a shared dropbox folder, unless you have better ideas. 

EDIT 1: Thanks for the positive. Let's make this a collaborative effort. Instead of hosting and getting multiple random versions, I think it would be best if we all share a folder. That way we can track version changes and roll back if needed, e.g. someone deletes everything then saves. Please **PM me your email address (the one linked to your dropbox)** and I will invite you to my dropbox folder...unless someone can suggest a better way to host this for collaboration.

 - Ordered a [Cap-M-Quik kit](http://emptycaps.com/all-in-one-kit-size-00-with-1000-gelatin-capsules.html) from 'Empty Caps Company' a few weeks ago.

 - I have advertised on a local tutoring website.

 - I got a call yesterday from someone requesting to meet up for some tutoring at 2:00pm today at a local library.

 - I got there and sent the 'student' a text message stating that I was at the library.

 - I was inside waiting at a table when two guys walked in (they were actually wearing stereotypical undercover police attire: long black coats and dark glasses), one of them showed me his badge and then handed me a sheet of paper with details about the capsule order on it, asking politely for an explanation.
Interestingly, the order information was forwarded from someplace in the US to the AFP, presumably this is common practice for 'suspicious' items.

 - Understandably at this point I was a little hot under the collar but I managed to construct some coherent sentences and explain what nootropics were and whatnot.

 - They then requested to investigate my room (I'm in student accommodation) to which I obviously obliged, by this stage we were more comfortable and were chatting about what I'm studying, where I'm from etc. I showed them my room, clearly showing them some caffeine powder and other supplements, they only looked around for a minute or so.

 - They then drove me back to the library (where my bike was locked up) but, before departing, shouted me a coffee at a nearby cafe! They were actually somewhat apologetic because I wrote up some maths notes and problems and was expecting to make $30.

It was quite a surreal experience, my first personal encounter with law enforcement.
I should say that, after the first few minutes, they were very friendly and I didn't feel uncomfortable at all.
The only issue I had was that, as specialists in drug investigation, they both hadn't heard of nootropics!

For 3 months i religiously followed a tight piracetam/choline/caffeine/theanine stack and afterwards i added adrafinil to the mix for another month. I felt like i've returned back to how i normally used to be but even still i slept in class. Once the semester was finished, i crashed hard, i was sleeping 13 hours a day for the almost the entire winter break. 

It continued onto the next semester once i've stopped taking the noots until i went to the doctor. One sleep test later i know i have moderate sleep apnea and i get shitty sleep with an apnea/hypopnea index of 19.8. I spent 9% of my sleep in REM (normal is 20-25%), 15% of my sleep in NREM3(normal is 30%) and spent 66% of my sleep in NREM2(normal is 50%). I started corrected my sleep habits and now i feel better than i ever felt while on the noots(CPAP didn't really help me much). I can exercise again, concentrate on assignments for more than 15 minutes and the best part is waking up and feeling awake after sleeping for just 7 hours. I never knew that i could wake up and not be able to sleep again. 

I just thought i should write this out because a lot of the time, i think people are using Nootropics to treat symptoms of a much bigger problem. It might be some sleep disorder, depression, or you might just not be interested in whatever it is you're doing. It could just be a small group of people though, but it's good to be aware of your body state. I'm going to start up my previous stack minus the adrafinil again and see how it'll affect me when i'm getting an adequate amount of sleep.

I avoided noopept since a Russian drug with Russian research didn't sound very appealing. I'm sorry for the gigantic wall of text, I just wrote everything I could think of, for those who are interested in the racetams I'm sure it's a good read. Just note that a lot of this is anecdotal. Your mileage may vary. If you think I wrote something horribly stupid, feel free to correct me.

Some things to keep into consideration:

- Everyone expierences racetams differently, since everyone's brain is different.. some people will expierence more vivid colors with a certain racetam, others will expierence more sophisticated sound while on the same substance. Some will expierence more motivation, others will get lazy. Trial and error is the key.

- Racetams influence your cholinergic system --&gt; brain consumes more acetylcholine (ACh). If you have a very effecient brain, you won't expierence any problems. If you have consumed most of the ACh, you'll start expierencing headaches. If you have an absolute overflow of ACh, you could expierence mild depression.

- I recommend taking everything on an empty stomach, since you'll absorb more and notice the effects more. Since you'll be paying quite a bit for these supplements, it would be a waste to take them with meals, unless in a hurry.

- Some people feel nauseous when taking both racetams and choline sources together on an empty stomach. If this is the case for you, seperate them. Some people who are very susceptible to cholinergic changes, might feel ""bad"" when taking supplements during the day. You could merit this by taking your dose before going to bed.

- I recommend everyone when starting supplementation, to just take piracetam for a couple of weeks. I personally take 2400mg single dose on an empty stomach in the morning. To expierence the piracetam effect sooner, you could ""attack dose"" the first 3 to 5 days. I used 4800mg the first day, 3600mg the next 4 days. Attack doses are ""to make to body used to the piracetam"", an unknown substance to the body. I'm not sure if it's necessary, but I did so either way to be sure. When you have taken piracetam before, and continue usage, attack dosing is no longer necessary.
The first 2 weeks, it's very normal to become more tired and have an occasional headache. If you keep having headaches after a couple of weeks, you will need to supplement choline.

When taking various racetams at the same time, choline supplementation is pretty much necessary to avoid headaches.

I recommend everything in powder form if possible. You can get used to any bad taste eventually, and it's very economical. I personally buy everything in powder form except for fat soluble medicin. I dissolve the powder in water and drink it down, or dissolve some in a bottle and take it with me during school. Since it's inconvenient to take powder with me, I buy fat soluble solutions in pill form. You could perfectly place powder at the back of your tong (taste less) and swallow down with some water, though.

Now: anecdotal expierences on the different racetams

Fish oil: fish oil is said to be very healthy for the brain, and a great deal of people take fish oil together with racetams. It's especially useful to take with fat soluble racetams like aniracetam and pramiracetam for improved absorption. The average fish oil / omega 3 soft gel has about 150mg EPA. For cognitional benefit, 600 to 1000mg would be optimal. Since taking this much can quickly be costly, I only take this much during cramming/finals. To combine with fat soluble racetams, I take 1 to 2 150mg EPA caps.

Choline: there's lots of different choline solutions. Bitartrate is the cheapest, and if it works for you, you don't *need* anything else. I never tried bitartrate. There's also choline citrate which is the tiniest bit more expensive. I personally take a small dose of Alpha GPC and a small dose of CDP choline in the morning, in a ""best of both worlds"" approach. I avoid taking more CDP choline later in the day; if I need more choline I take alpha GPC.

Alpha GPC and CDP choline have their own influences on your cognition and mood/motivation (subtle, mild). I don't know if it justifies their cost above bitartrate when the latter is as effective, though. Alpha GPC and CDP choline are also said to be neuroprotective and thus make you less susceptible to things like Alzheimer's disease when you supplement long term. CDP choline is also said to aid falling asleep, could be useful for insomniacs. I also noticed increased libido while on Alpha GPC. Nothing major, but it's noticeable.

Another viable choline solution is ALCAR, but upon reading people complaining about neck tension whilst taking this drug, I decided to stay away from ALCAR. Something to note: neck tension can be a sign of an overload of choline levels, but what made me suspicious of ALCAR is that the person that had the neck tension (longecity post somewhere) took a normal ALCAR dose, and had this neck pain for a while *after* supplementation. I'd rather not.

Finally, there's also DMAE as a viable choline precursor. I know little of it, but it's supposed to be affordable and effective.

**Piracetam**: the most affordable racetam, and the most researched (very harmless). It is said to mildly make you **more creative, more fluent in conversation**. It is also said to be neuroprotective.
Makes me **feel sharper, more serious and concious of my actions**, more determined to do constructive things. It doesn't really motivate as much as other things, but it makes me concious and guilty of being lazy.

Most importantly, the big extra for me whilst on piracetam is **IMPROVED sleep, and REQUIRING LESS SLEEP**. I easily need to sleep ~1 hour less *every day*. I am rarely sleep deprived these days. I take the same dose of piracetam in the morning and before going to sleep (some people may expierence vivid dreams) minus the CDP choline. Works wonders.

As a chronic tinnitus sufferer, I actually started piracetam because of reading somewhere that this substance could aid me with my disease. It doesn't change anything noise-wise, but I feel less annoyed, attached to the noise. I notice when I'm on piracetam, and when I'm not taking piracetam. It definitely helps me cope.

Either way, for about 80$/kg, you can't really go wrong, especially for further potentiating the other racetams.

Half-life is pretty long, personally I take some in the morning and have effects lasting all day.

**Aniracetam**: I have only just been taking aniracetam. The first time I took it, I was very irritated, but recently I gave it another try and fell in love. It basically **eats away my stress** (as someone else said in some forum: it makes you concious of stressful situations, but you don't feel stressed out), and on top of that **MOTIVATES ME to get things done**. Other's say that the anxiolytic effect of aniracetam makes them lazy.  It's also said to make you
**more attentive/sharper**, hence why it's also very viable to be used during classes. Something I'd like to add: I've noticed that ani also suppresses my hunger, which isn't a bad thing for me. Finally, it's said to mildly make you **more fluent in conversation**.

Half-life is 1-1.5 hours, so it doesn't work very long. I take 750mg whenever I need some.

**Oxiracetam and pramiracetam**: personally, I think these are pretty similar. They are said to **facilitate learning and recall**, with pramiracetam being especially effective in improving logic. Both are said to be potentionally blunting your emotions. Pramiracetam is more expensive, even in its required smaller doses, so if oxiracetam works, I recommend sticking with that. I personally HATED oxiracetam, it made me hypomanic and useless. **Pramiracetam motivates me** similar to aniractam (oxi doesn't at all) **and makes me think clearer**, but has its side effects (mildly blunted emotions as mentioned before, but I also seem to have a bit of a crash when stopping supplementation of prami). Recommended as an (expensive) drug to be taken when cramming / during finals.

Half-life for both should be about as long as piracetam, if you take a large dose in the morning, on an empty stomach. For those that no longer ""feel"" the drug later in the day, multiple smaller doses spread throughout the day would be recommended.

Finally, some more things to note: 

- Even if a drug has motivating abilities, it's up to you and your discipline to actually *start working and get things done*. The drug won't do the work for you.

- I personally never take more than two racetams at the same time (I start to feel weird and feel jittery, start having negative results), and try not to take any heavy medication when taking any nootropic.

- When importing, make sure to check your [country's laws](http://www.erowid.org/smarts/piracetam/piracetam_law.shtml) on illegal substances and importing limitations/restrictions. [Here's a helpful price list](http://users4.jabry.com/isochroma/Racetam%20Prices.htm) made by isochroma. You can buy the basics from amazon, nutraplanet, iherb, ... other options are nootropichub or intellimeds (both sent from UK) to have quick EU deliveries; ""boostmygrade"" (US) is a somewhat more expensive option, but offers combo pills. Cerebral health (US) also has combo pills (Synaptine brand).

- I do not drink alcohol when on any racetam. I once did, and got drunk from 3 beers (a weird kind of drunk, you realize a lot more than with the usual drunk sensation, but with the vision impairment and slower reflexes). This may vary with other people, but I don't think it's healthy for your brain to do so either way.

- These substances are all pretty harmless on short term intake, but aside from piracetam I'm not aware of any long-term research, therefore ***please stop supplementing whenever you have unexpected side effects, and consult a doctor whenever something suspicious is going on***.",,False,,t5_2r81c,True,,,True,t3_kc6sc,http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/kc6sc/my_expierences_with_the_various_racetams_so_far/,
1350979908.0,72,self.Nootropics,11xqdr,Modafinil has mysteriously given me the charisma of an extreme extrovert - Let's talk about the social effects of Modafinil!,bioancient,89,17,137,http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/11xqdr/modafinil_has_mysteriously_given_me_the_charisma/,"I would like to request that everyone keep discussion on the SOCIAL effects and aspects of modafinil in this post as modafinil itself has been generally discussed many times before.  

Also, I would like to say MY RESULTS ARE NOT TYPICAL! There are people who get the complete opposite effects that I describe. I do not claim that anyone should take modafinil. It seems I am an outlier.  

I know modafinil has controversy. As many people report some type of success with it, I researched it for 25+ hours before taking it because it's schedule 4 in the US and might have abuse potential. I've also taken many nootropics over the past 3 years.  

Here is what I decided to do:

-Take 150mg armodafinil daily on wake until tolerance set in or 30 days straight. Why? Because many people claim high, low, or no tolerance. I wanted to find the correct dose for me. I assumed that tolerance would set in a week or two and I would find my tolerance level.  

***Note: I am using the word modafinil instead of armodafinil because it would appear they have extremely similar effects and modafinil is 50% armodafinil. I have not taken adrafinil or modafinil. Modafinil is way more popular than armodafinil so I'm going to refer to it as modafinil.  

***Note: I have been using oxiracetam 1g a day on and off for the past 3 years, and oxiracetam has been taken in conjunction with this test. The effect is very subtle, nothing compared to the following.  

***Note: I have ingested zero other drugs besides oxiracetam during this time period described, even zero caffeine and no soda.  

For the effect, I thought that the effect would be more focus and attention.  

Here is what happened:

Increased awareness of visual environment

Increased focus

Increased visualization

Increased thought speed

Increased reading comprehension

The weird thing is, I didn't appear to have any deficits in any of these I was simply trying to improve beyond a normal human!  

Bad Side Effects:
-Lower hunger
-Takes longer to get to sleep

I expected crashes to happen, irritability, feeling the effects wear off, it DOES NOT HAPPEN. There are no crashes, no irritability, no feeling effects wearing off.  

One key difference is that I did not care about cutting down sleep. I have slept 8 to 9 hours each night, although a couple nights were 5 hours.  

Before, I slept 9-9.5 hours a night.  

Anyway, now that the background is set, let's go over what I originally wanted to talk about!  

I have been an introvert internally my whole life. I do not have aspergers, autism, or above average social anxiety. I have worked over the past 10 years to become more social, and succeeded. I have 5 best friends and 50~ people in my social circle, and actively like to go socialize. I notice many people more introverted than me and many people more extroverted. But I need to 'recharge' and have alone time which is typical of introverts. Introverts I have asked told me I appear to be an extrovert, and extroverts recognize I am more quiet.  

After the 2nd week of modafinil, I started noticing I was talking extremely fast around my best friends. I started to realize that if I continued they would think I was on METH or something since they all watch Breaking Bad, so I deliberately slowed down my speech and then slowly increased it over a week. Perhaps they just think I am in a good mood as I talk much more, I don't really know.  

I never increased the dose at all from 150mg armodafinil a day, as I don't think it is safe, especially with this huge effect.  

After I started noticing how witty I have become, I decided to test out the limits of my new social skills. I booked up my entire social schedule for 4 days straight talking to people 10 hours a day:  

-All sorts of random friends
-20 person friend group, haven't seen for a month
-10 person friend newish group, haven't seen for 2 weeks
-Joined a brand new 8 person group on a community meetup site to test with new people

I had to make sure I wasn't delusional and that I was actually gaining some sort of charisma ability. I have done similar tests before without any drugs and well, I don't succeed. I crashed and needed to recharge.  

After 4 days I had personal proof that this made a dramatic change in my personality for the better. I went from just being someone in a group, to the center of attention along with all the other extreme extroverts. People started trying to vying for my attention, opinions, and I started getting lots of direct eye contacts with everyone. I was genuinely making people really happy and making them laugh.  

This is making me sound like I used to be the most boring person in the word, and depressed but I wasn't at all! I was average socially and not depressed. Extreme top 10% extroverts usually do not pay me much attention, but everyone else seemed to many times.  

It would appear, that modafinil has brought me into the top 10% of extroverts and gave me all their abilities of attraction, charisma, and spreading unlimited feelings of happiness. When I say happiness, I don't mean I am happier, it is that I can make people FEEL happiness much more often by simply talking with them.  

It is truly breathtaking, it's like I just know how someone is feeling, I do all sorts of things to make them feel happy, I genuinely care about everything they say, I create elaborate jokes and discussions about anything. I get everyone excited about any topic. I gauge what each person is like and tailor my communication to them and the group. I just started KNOWING all these things and doing them AUTOMATICALLY. The key here is these abilities just started to automatically appear out of no where after I started taking modafinil. It's like I am a con man with no con.  

I have read similar stories for street drugs, and all of this screams CRASH, CRASH, CRASH. But there is no crash. There is no wide eyed drug addict effect going on. I am relaxed, and have drive. It is a constant effect. I am completely calm, yet have complete control to do anything I would like to do. I haven't taken any risks that put me in any danger, in fact I feel much safer as I am more aware of everything in the environment. I don't feel like a cracked out meth head at all, everything is clear, and I keep watching for warning signs constantly. The only crash is the everyday crash everyone has, they fall asleep for X hours and then wake up and start anew.  

As you can see from the length of this post, I can continue talking or writing forever. I couldn't before. I would 'zone out' if I talked for too long, and get worn out if I tried to write for too long. But honestly, that is just being a normal being. Normal humans don't talk or write forever.  

So as of now, everything sounds too good to be true for me personally. Of course, the statement in everyone's mind is ""YOUR WITHDRAWAL IS GOING TO SUCK!""  

Going into this I expected there might be withdrawal, and have totally accepted it before I even started taking modafinil. I refuse to destroy my life and abuse a drug, my life is too important to ruin.  

So after 30 days I stopped taking it, expecting the worst, but knew I could recover. And the worst didn't come. The effect was 90%. Then 4 more days of the same thing, 90% effect. All my abilities are still here. I'm still a top 10% extrovert. I still have all the increased mental abilities.  

Today was day 6, and I was completely baffled from no withdrawal effect. I do wonder if this permanently 'rewired' my brain to somehow keep the effects, similar to what I hear from psychedelic drugs. (I have not taken any) I decided to take 150mg armodafinil today to see if I could tell a difference. The effect went to 100% instead of 90%. So there was a tiny irrelevant difference.  

Anyway I have decided to stop taking it for 30 days to further test what happens in withdrawal, and if I truly revert back to normal. I don't really mind being in my normal state, I was happy before. I just feel like many other people here that there are safe drugs that can enhance human cognition without side effects or destructive effects.  

Explanations:

-I have some unknown disease. Considering I have a clean bill of health both physically and mentally, any doctor would laugh in my face. I don't have any symptoms. Did I have a unknown certain type of 'introversion' that was 'cured'? Did I have narcolepsy without 100% falling asleep in the middle of the day? If I went to a sleep doctor and said, ""Once in a while I take a small nap during the day, can you give me some narcolepsy drugs to test?"" they would put me on some drug abusers list. ""No doctor, I need to be the life of the party! The extrovert of extroverts!"" Hah.  

-This is all placebo. I have taken many nootropics in the past as a hobby and to increase general health. Most have no perceived effects so I eventually stop taking them. I would love for any other nootropic than a schedule 4 drug to unlock all these abilities automatically. Considering most people seem to become more introverted on modafinil, the effect was completely unexpected.  

-I'm destroying my dopamine/norepinephrine receptors. I don't know, maybe, but how come I don't have side effects or withdrawal effects when the drug is not even in my system after 5 days? I'll test this by going off modafinil for 30 days.  

-I'm delusional. Considering the amount of work I accomplish and genuine happiness that people show when talking to me, I doubt this. Why would new people I meet ask me for my phone number then?  

-I read some book that inspired me. Nope, haven't read any books in a while or major life changes before taking modafinil. In the past I have read many ""social psychology"" books as any introvert would, (typical introvert; thinks reading social books is the way to get social skills) but failed to truly automate most of it in the real world.  

-I'm trying to sell modafinil. As I said before, this effect is NOT typical. Most people seem to feel awful if they continue using modafinil for too long in a row. Many people can't even perceive any effect and just use it to pull all nighters. Please do not make comments about sources in this thread!  

For little proof, go look in my account history, I have an unedited post from 3 years ago that says the following, and my opinion still stands:  

""I will counter by proposing a theory that brain performance drugs may increase awareness, memory, and plasticity, therefore allowing more connections between neurons to be formed. If I define creativity as a connection between two ideas to make another idea, and the biological basis for this is more neural connections, and if brain performance drugs increase neural connections, I would say that brain performance drugs increase creativity. But like this article, I have no scientific evidence for this because no scientific experiments have been developed yet that I know of that can accurately test the vague notion of ""creativity."" Disclaimer: This post was made using brain performance drugs.""  

Little did I know, I may actually have found what I have been looking for for 3 years.  

The reason why I don't normally post on this account is that I don't want anyone that I know in real life to see a post like this and then think I am a drug abuser as the public is very misinformed.  

**The reason for making this now enormous post, is to discuss the following information:**  

-Have you gotten increased social abilities from modafinil?

-Have you gotten decreased social abilities from modafinil?

-Have you taken modafinil 30+ days in a row and what happened?

-Do you experience no tolerance to modafinil?

-Have you been taking modafinil consistently for 1+ year and gained social abilities you haven't had before?

-Have you experienced any bad withdrawal effects from modafinil use?

-Have you tried taking modafinil without sacrificing sleep as these effects were only attained by me sleeping normally?  


**TLDR; Modafinil has given me the abilities of the most charismatic of extroverts without crashes or side effects, and I write a diatribe with my new writing abilities questioning why modafinil worked so well for me, much like a person who has the audacity to ask a genie why he actually granted him his wish.**

I have noticed a trend happening where this sub seems to be veering away from the standards we used to have. There are more jokey answers which are ok in moderation depending on context imo but when the most upvoted reply in a [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/10casp/what_is_the_most_potent_nootropic/) is 'Meth' you start to doubt what advice people are giving and the scientific integrity of this subreddit regardless of how stupid the question is.

We are still getting stack advice posts and thats to be expected, there will always be a percentage of new-comers who don't read the FAQ or just don't care [Example](http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/10c39q/dosage_experiences_with_galantamine_pyritinol/) and people are still answering the questions in the post despite what it says in the FAQ


If someone has either not read the FAQ properly and is unwilling to do the research themselves then it scares me a bit. The fact the some people seem to think asking a bunch of internet people about putting a active chemical into their body without knowing all the risks and information is a smart thing to do. Should we be reporting and deleting these posts on sight?

The other type has read the FAQ and for some reason believes they are above the rules of this subreddit and still posts knowingly- do we really want to reward this behavior? Thereby encouraging it. 

This is a grey area of reddit and giving stack advice could be considered as medical advice thereby violating reddits terms of service (I may have been guilty of this at times!). For this reason especially I think we need to keep stack advice out of this sub completely cause if someone comes along and decides it does violate the TOS and clicks open this sub and sees 3 or 4 stack advice posts with replies then we could get banned. I would prefer to lose stackadvice than stackadvice and nootropics together. We can always create /r/ninjastackadvice ;)

I love this subreddit and because of you guys and gals a real difference has been made to my daily life but we are talking about putting chemicals into your body with the *objective of changing your brains behavior* and that is not a thing to take lightly which is why an objective look at what people post (comments included) is needed. I think we need to decide on some community agreed standards and actually enforce them.
We really do have some great things going on with some good content being posted and interesting anecdotes. Hell we even have noot shops coming here asking what they should do, these things indicate we are doing some things right.


What do people think? Am I being a bit too uptight?

I was, not too many years ago, but besides melatonin and tea, I was busy with other things. Since then, I've come to find nootropics interesting for *more* than just their utility.

They shed light on issues in philosophy of biology &amp; evolution ( http://www.gwern.net/Drug%20heuristics ), argue against naive psychological dualism, offer cases in point on the history of technology &amp; civilization ( http://www.gwern.net/Melatonin#health-performance ) or recent theories about willpower ( http://www.gwern.net/Melatonin#self-discipline ), challenge our understanding of the validity of statistics and psychology ( http://www.gwern.net/DNB%20FAQ#fn51 ) where they don't offer nifty little problems in statistics and economics themselves (see http://www.gwern.net/Modafinil#ordering-behavior and subsections), and are excellent fodder for the young [Quantified Self](http://quantifiedself.com/) movement\*; modafinil itself demonstrates the little-known fact that sleep has no accepted evolutionary explanation.

And how can one understand the history of Southeast Asia and the Vietnamese War without reference to heroin ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Politics_of_Heroin_in_Southeast_Asia ), or more contemporaneously, how can one understand the lasting appeal of the Taliban in Afghanistan and the unpopularity &amp; corruption of the central government without reference to the Taliban's frequent anti-drug campaigns or the drug-funded warlords of the Northern Alliance?

I was wondering what /r/nootropics thinks of the idea of using extremely low dose psychedelics as nootropics?

I was recently doing some experimentation and found that a sub-threshold dose of psilocybin seems to improve communication skills and also creative technical thinking.

I am aware that there were early experiments where researchers attempted to solve problems they were stuck on under the influence of LSD. I think there's also a study that found cognitive improvements for psilocybin for word association tasks. I don't have citations right now, but I can try to find links if anyone's interested.

It seems to me that psychedelics simultaneously distort model-based thinking, but also make it easier to find the right cognitive model to approach a task. Could this be a counterbalance in the nootropics arsenal to substances such as caffeine and modafinil, which seem to me to increase productivity at the expense of peripheral cognition and creativity? 

Any thoughts, experiences?",,False,,t5_2r81c,False,,,True,t3_v3jyx,http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/v3jyx/extremely_low_dose_psychedelics_as_nootropics/,

Finding the right dosage is, however, very essential to reap its full benefits. I was shocked (yeah, I was truthfully shocked!) how immensely powerful this herb felt like after having a go at a full gram. What it essentially does is obliterate fatigue, mind and body, enhances endurance, significantly heightens concentration, mood and empathy (not MDMA-like obviously), and best of all, that was at the expense of having zero side effects. Cool, huh?

Dosing once at the morning will ensure that its effects will last the whole day; I also dosed late afternoon the other day and I couldn't sleep -- common symptoms of insomnia kicked in with full force. It's worth to add that I'm one of those people who typically have no trouble sleeping even after ingesting huge amounts of caffeine a few hours before sleep. This herb is incredibly intense, has a very powerful stimulant-like properties. 

For the sake of comparison, I'm prescribed to take ritalin. Ingesting a gram+ of Rhodiola Rosea felt remarkably similar to methylphenidate, of course minus the OCD-induced traits and other nasty side effects that are very typical with psychostimulants (the horrible crash first comes to mind).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

moral of the story: some of the molecules discussed in this forum **can get you killed**. The side-bar absolutely needs something more immediate than ""please read the FAQ before posting questions"". It needs to have a massive warning. Life doesn't come with a warning ""not to be a fucking idiot"" (sorry for ableist language), but to be fair there are some pretty subtle ways\* you can be an idiot. In trying to heal the rift between myself and nature (as we all are on this planet, pretty much at this point in history), i only exposed how wide that rift of ignorance is... i will respect the plants forever.

\* Actually, an interesting point that has come up now, is that *prescription* medications and supplements come with very lengthy printed manuals, whole bibles on how not to fuck up, outlining the many shades and categories of subtlety. This is notably lacking for the plants I was eating. Perhaps this reflects the observable bias/tendency of this forum in general towards the prescription, modern-industrial-pharmaceutical, methods? Could it be that in trying to bridge the gap between ourselves and nature, we realize only how wide that gap has become in time, and deep in ignorance? We have the availability of shamanic herbs and plants, but neither the spiritual/medicinal tradition/history/knowledge to avail ourselves of their benefits safely, nor the cultural systems in place to transmit that knowledge or install it as a gate-keeper into the realms of availability.

One of the reasons we do what we [edit: lm] do is because we deeply believe in the value of freedom.

We believe that human freedom is meaningless if it does not include freedom of information.  And we believe that freedom of information is rooted in freedom of thought.  And we believe that freedom of thought is not truly freedom if it does not encompass full cognitive liberty.

We champion freely sharing information and exercising freedom of thought.  

One of the most important reasons we [edit: lm] sell nootropic materials is because we believe in cognitive liberty.  

We believe that every person has the right to do with their own body and mind what they choose.  

There are no freedoms more fundamental than these.

But we also believe that this freedom is inseparably bound with responsibility.

We intend to sell nootropic materials to careful, knowledgeable purchasers for research, because we understand it is not responsible for us to sell them as supplements to the careless and insufficiently informed.

If we become explicitly aware that a specific purchaser is using our nootropic materials in a manner other than their intended use, it is our responsibility to seek to prevent that purchaser making further purchases from us.

If this happens often, we may decide it is our responsibility to delist our nootropics until we can find a better way to make them available responsibly.

We would not do this because we acquiesce to the idea that people should be banned by some authority from doing what they choose with their own body and mind, or from consuming or ingesting anything they determine is right for them, in any way they prefer.

Instead, we would do this because for the community as a whole, continued access to nootropics by interested, responsible and qualified adult researchers can be endangered by their ""misuse"".  One person's actions can affect many.

It is an unchanging reality of life that authorities will always seek, extend, and legitimate power over individuals by pointing to dangers, and finding ways to protect people from those dangers.

Widespread misuse of nootropic materials in a manner other than their intended purpose may very well result in exacerbating FDA intervention, enabling sensationalism, and influencing popular opinion in favor of tighter restrictions.

Governments love it when people given free rein don't behave like responsible adults, because it gives them free reign to treat us like children.

How can one feel entitled to control ones self, if one cannot control ones self?  How can I expect to govern myself, if I cannot govern myself?

Freedom is tied to responsibility.  Freedom IS responsibility.  We cannot have one, without the other.

We respectfully ask all nootropics researchers to take this into consideration.

Cognitive liberty is the freedom of sovereign control over one's own consciousness. 

It is an extension of the concepts of freedom of thought and self-ownership.

The American nonprofit Center for Cognitive Liberty and Ethics, founded and directed by neuroethicist Dr. Wrye Sententia and legal theorist Richard Glen Boire, defines cognitive liberty as ""the right of each individual to think independently and autonomously, to use the full spectrum of his or her mind, and to engage in multiple modes of thought.""

An individual who enjoys cognitive liberty is [one who is] free to alter the state of their consciousness using any method they choose...

""When I say to you that you are free, I mean that you are responsible. ... You cannot say that somebody else forced you to do it - because you are free: nobody can force you. Because you are free, it is your decision to do something or not to do something. 

With freedom comes responsibility. **Freedom IS responsibility.**

**The more responsible you become, the more free you become; and, the more free you become, the more responsibility comes on you.**

Then you have to be very alert to what you are doing, what you are saying. Even about your small unconscious gestures you have to be very alert - because there is nobody else to control you, it is only you. When I say to you that you are free, I mean that you are a God. It is not licence, it is tremendous discipline.""

""Freedom of will

There is an important dimension to freedom that is often forgotten: freedom of will. Although our freedom may be constrained and our choices limited, in the moment when we choose, we experience freedom. We understand that we could have made a different choice. But how free are we really? 

If you decide to do something but then give up, are you free? If you find yourself doing something you know you shouldn't do, and you know you will regret it later, but still you cannot stop yourself, are you free? 

Do you have the freedom to follow your conscience? Do you have the freedom to forgive someone, or do you sometimes say, “I cannot forgive that person”? Do you have the freedom to apologize?

True freedom is closely linked to self-control. Only a self-disciplined person can decide to do something and accomplish it.

True freedom is the freedom to follow one’s conscience and maintain one’s personal integrity. This is freedom of will. It sometimes involves struggle, and it takes a lot of courage. Yet it leads to more and more of a sense of liberation and fulfillment. The joy of freedom is not only to be able to choose, but to be able to choose well—to choose the right and the good.""

""**Freedom, from an existential perspective, cannot be separated from responsibility. With freedom comes responsibility.** ...

The degree to which a person is unaware of those forces which influence us, they are controlled by them. ... The degree which we are unaware of how our drives, instincts, unconscious, and environment are influencing us, they control us.  ... If a person chooses not to be aware of these influences, even if done so passively or unconsciously, a choice has still been made.

Self-awareness ... is a commitment people make which can enhance their freedom. Yet, most people choose to live a life of being unaware. It can be frightening to deeply know who we are and the realities of our existence. Yet, it can be even more rewarding.

**To live a responsible life is to live a life committed to self-awareness.**

If the choice made is to merely be a product of our biology, our unconscious, and our environment; then the choice has been made to live an inauthentic and irresponsible life.""

I have yet to receive my order of modanifil placed on June 17th. I've demanded a refund or tracking number but continue to get the run around from Nathaniel and employees. Ill be happy to post my order number and conversations as proof.
Extremely upset with the poor customer service. Never again BTCnootropics. I believe they scam certain customers while relying on the testimony of customers that have received orders. Enjoy my $200 scammers.

My 16 day old armodafinil order still has not shipped. It's been 6 days since Nathaniel says all outstanding orders were cleared yet there is no evidence of that.
I submitted a support ticket about this 2 days ago and received a completely contradictory response basically saying that nothing has changed and they are still waiting on their suppliers, with no end in sight:
There are still strikes occurring and no tracking has been received. We're not the ones to blame in this equation. The supplier we use is being a bit slow on things. Hopefully this can be resolved soon.
How can these two statements be reconciled? Why don't they put a notice on their website about the current status of this situation? (they still only say to expect a 3-5 day delay). Why haven't they keep us updated on the situation through Twitter? They haven't had anything to say there for 2 weeks.
I'm trying to be understanding about this but this type of behavior is not the way to reassure customers.

I can report a similar experience with BTCNootropics. I made an order on 7/1, #51d23399, and have yet to see any updates on it, aside from a reply to a support ticket I sent on 7/9. The reply simply said ""There are delays with all orders, you can blame us if you require, we are trying our hardest to get things moving but we've not received tracking for many orders"", which tells me nothing. I just sent them another ticket to cancel my order if it can't be shipped next week.


[–]LegoOctopus[S] 2 points 15 minutes ago
It's actually been 11 days now. It was six days when I emailed them.
I honestly don't think they're trying to scam anyone. Rather, I think they did a really good job at first, ended up with way more business than they expected, and don't know how to scale quickly. And in fairness, scaling quickly is notoriously hard. People like to say that it's ""a good problem to have"", but it's not. It's just a problem, and a hard one at that.
What isn't cool is the way they're handling customer service. It feels like they're using the Google model - providing lame service directly, but taking good care of those who take it to a public forum.

I ordered from mymodafinil.com/net to Australia. Delivery in around 9 days. No issues at customs, not even opened.

I took one pill of 200mg most days. Some days I lowered the dose to 100mg or skipped.

The first week side effects were most noticeable. Over the first few days I got a headache about 5-6 hours after taking. On the second day I felt zoned out at the end of the day. After the first week those side effects went completely.

**Mental Effects**

Um, not entirely sure. Before taking I had read some of the famous articles/blog posts like the ones by Johann Harri and Sebastian Marshall. I was expecting more. Some huge transformation but, to be honest, it was nothing like that. Subtle is the word.

On the first day I did have a bit of tunnel vision. Like I got out the pool and went to the changing rooms but forgot I had left my towel at the side and had to go back for it. Or I'd be writing code and look up and there is a cold cup of tea beside me that I had completely forgotten was there because I had so much focus.

This lessened after a while.

Overall I'd say I did absolutely nothing that I couldn't have done anyway but looking back over the day you do seem to get more done. Things you've written get a few hundred more words (which can be good and bad), gym sessions aren't skipped, etc.

It's subtle but not crazy huge.

Oh, and one other thing while I'm checking this for typos - I think I make fewer typos. :) Seriously, never thought about that before.

**Sleep and Alertness**

I always take in the morning and have no problems sleeping. If I compare to days when there is no modafinil in my system I would say any time I have lacked sleep has had less of an effect.

For instance, yesterday I had an early start. I hadn't taken any moda for two days. At the end of the day I was nodding off in front of the tv. On moda that kind of thing just doesn't seem to happen. It's hard to spot the absence of something though. It's not like I'm going 'Ooh, I just feel normal right now - the two hours of early start isn't affecting me'. You just don't notice it.

**Biggest Change**

The biggest change for me, and the reason I have no qualms in re-ordering, has been health and fitness. Loss of appetite is listed as just being a side effect but for me this is just awesome.

Since starting I have less desire to eat unhealthily and more desire to workout. It really is astounding.

I haven't had any junk food at all apart from dessert at holiday events. I've eaten a much healthier diet overall including lots of veg. I've worked out at least five days a week. 

It's like my sweet tooth is gone. I just don't crave those things and it's easier for me to plan to eat healthily.

I wasn't particularly overweight to start with but over the past seven weeks I've lost fat and gained muscle. It's cool. Unlike previous times when I've been on a health kick it seems effortless. I feel like it could go on forever and that I'm not depriving myself.

**Alcohol**

I seem to be able to drink more sensibly. I binge drink a lot less. I can have two and stop. This was a minor issue for me and it's been cool to not have hangovers.

**Biggest Problem**

My biggest issue is... my girlfriend. She, understandably, is very worried about me self-prescribing pills. She worries I'll be addicted, do myself harm and that I'm listening to nonsense on the internet.

I take her points on board and do consider everything she says but I'm happy to take the small risk. It does cause friction between us and I just try to not talk about it. Which is a shame as I have lots to say and it's been a very positive experience.

** End Note

As always the placebo effect could be a huge part of this... but well it is what it is. 

Other things I take atm that may influence this :

- Aniracetam
- Choline
- Fish Oil
- Creatine
- 5 cups of green tea a day

I weighed out 100mg and decided to do a sublingual test. It is soluble in water, but not very much. This, mixed with the fact that the taste is not as palatable as oxiracetam, makes it one that I probably will not dose sublingually in the future. It's not nearly as bad as pramiracetam, though. NEVER dose pramiracetam sublinigally, as it will literally burn your mouth. Noopept doses sublingually very nicely. That is my preferred method, actually. Nefiracetam gave me the same characteristic sneeze that I get when taking noopept, which I found interesting. Noopept will always make me sneeze about a minute after a sublingual dose. It might be the taste, or something else entirely, since I don't get that with other substances.

It's now about 2 hours after my dose, and I can say without a doubt that this stuff is strong! This is as strong as the first time I tried pramiracetam, and at a smaller dose.

A while back I chugged a couple of two-liters of Mountain Dew within a very short period of time and thought I was going to have a heart attack. 

620 milligrams of caffeine might not sound like a lot throughout the course of a day but when it hits you all at once then you experience some terrible side effects.

An hour later I was experiencing heart palpitations, vivid closed eye hallucinations, derealization, depersonalization, time dilation, and various other negative side effects. My heart rate hovered at 150-160 BPM and I was losing grip of reality over the course of many hours. All of this occurred while at my nieces birthday party. 

I started becoming weary of my caffeine consumption and decided to completely cut soda from my diet. I've seen the price of caffeine powder online and figured it would save me a lot of money and I could cut out the calories and excess sugars that came from drinking soda. 

I ended up buying a pound bag of caffeine for $15.

I can now accurately dose however much I want whenever I want without having to spend as much on unhealthy alternatives. I take 250mg with 500mg of L-Theanine whenever I want the extra boost and I love it.

I wanted to share with you my experience with Aniracetam having taken it for a week.  I am roughly taking about 750 mg each dose along with 500 mg of Choline and about 1000mg of fish oil.  I take one dose in the morning and one dose in the late afternoon.


Upon taking it the first day, I immediately noticed effects within a half hour.  I felt what I would describe as a slight ""high"" feeling.  I coudln't quite decern what it was at first, but after a week of taking it, I can quite confidently say that it was a feeling of mental clarity (and quite profound I might add).  I was no longer distracted as much with worrysome thoughts and stresses in my life.  Overall my anxieties  were tangibly reduced which was a huge benefit for me.   That first night I felt incredibly motivated and had a bit of a revelation of sorts regarding my life.  It was quite a profound experience which I think was largely due to my mind being free of all the clutter that would normally bog me down.  I was very focused and my ability to concentrate was greatly improved.   At night, I did feel a bit wound up and discovered it was a bit harder to fall asleep.  


The next day provided much of the same effects, but with one addition.  I noticed some interesting visual experiences that were quite notable.  Colours and lights were very vibrant and  more pronounced.  I suppose i would describe it as being more aware of my suroundings and being more in tune with my senses. These effects lasted for about 2 hours or so?  However, the mental clarity, the increased focus and the reduced anxiety lasted pretty much all day.  A note about the anxiety.  I feel as though I am able to tolerate a lot more stress along with other things that would normally make me quite anxious.  For example, socialzing felt a lot easier to me and for someone who is quite introverted and shy, this was a great plus.  In general, I just feel a lot more tolerant to things i usually have a hard time with.  


The following day, I went to the gym after work and noticed that my workout was very effortless.  Most times there is a bit of a mental struggle to get through my workouts, but this time it felt quite easy.  My Motivation levels were high and once again my focus was very sharp.  I did also feel as if I had increased energy and that was a surprise as I didnt' really get much sleep the night prior.  The evening proved to be also quite productive for me as I was able get a lot done that I have been putting off lately. 


The next few days provided me with very much of the same.  Increased mental clarifty, alertness, concentration, a clear direction on various things in my life and a general sense of things feeling ""right"".  I can honestly say that I've never felt so good before.  I will say however that I don't believe that the aniracetam has enhanced anything per se.  It's more that I feel like it has brought me back up to a normal healthier baseline (from which I was severly below before).  I feel like I am a much more positive person as a result.


TL;DR - Aniracetam has severly reduced my anxiety, has allowed me to take back control of my life and has given me a new sense of purpose through increased mental clarity, focus and motivation.

A [Google search](http://www.google.com/?q=modafinil+tolerance) for ""modafinil tolerance"" produces many dozens of blog posts, forum comments etc., of people reporting building tolerance or wondering how to reduce the effects of tolerance.

However, searches of [PubMed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=modafinil+tolerance) or [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com.au/scholar?q=modafinil%2Btolerance) do not produce any substantive results on the matter. I have been unable to find any publications mentioning tolerance, except to say it is ""well tolerated"" toxicologically.

As a practical matter, I am interested in the following question:

**Is this tolerance effect real? If so, under what conditions does it appear and can it be mitigated by appropriate dosing; supplementation with other drugs; or otherwise?**

At this point, I would like to mention that I do not have a background in pharmacology, only that I have spent a few hours researching and synthesising the literature.

I hypothesise several explanations for this discrepancy:

1. The anecdotal reports are incorrect, whether due to psychosomatic effects or just unreliable, subjective observers.

2. The anecdotal reports refer to different dosing regimes, e.g higher doses with specific effects that build tolerance.

3. Tolerance is only built to certain effects (nootropic) which were not examined in clinical studies as they are irrelevant to its prescribed indication (narcolepsy, SAD, work-shift disorder, etc.)

4. Observed tolerance is due to interaction with other drugs in the nootropic ""stack""

5. Tolerance effects have been missed in clinical studies, or were too minor to mention

6. Tolerance is due to sleep deprivation with Modafinil being used as a replacement for sleep

I found two major reviews of Modafinil in the literature:

**[A Systematic Review of Modafinil - Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006)](http://www.josephmatta.com/modafinil.pdf)**

This review is aimed at clinical psychiatrists and does not make any mention of long-term tolerance. If tolerance were mentioned in the literature, it should be here due to its relevance to a prescribing psychiatrist.

**[Modafinil: A Review of Neurochemical Actions and Effects on Cognition; Minzenberg, Carter - Neuropsychopharmacology (2008)](http://www.nature.com/npp/journal/v33/n7/pdf/1301534a.pdf)**

This is a comprehensive review, from which I have summarised a few relevant points:

* ""Major pharmacokinetic parameters are independent of doses in the range 200-600 mg/day""

* ""Elimination occurs primarily in the liver, via amide hydrolysis and a lesser component by cytochrome P450 mediated oxidation""

* ""Exerts a [small] but concentration-dependent induction of CYP 1A2, 2B6 and 3A4""

* CYP3A4 induction produces a significant interaction with ehinylestradiol and triazolam [(Robertson et al, 2002)](http://www.nature.com/clpt/journal/v71/n1/pdf/clpt20027a.pdf)

* Does not affect the spontaneous release of dopamine from mouse striatal synaptosomes

* DAT knockout mice do not experience waking effect

* ""...have found modafinil to have long-term efficacy for sleepiness extending for as long as 136 weeks, and to be well-tolerated, with no evidence of significant adverse events or abuse (Besset et al, 1996; Hirshkowitz et al, 2006; Mitler et al, 2000)""

* Directly binds to dopamine and noradrenaline transporters with ""modest potency""

* Produces significantly elevated extracellular dopamine, noradrenaline, seretonin, hyaluronan, glutamate and decreased GABA

* Elevated Dopamine, Noradrenaline appear to be primary, other effects are hypothesised to be secondary.

* Does not stimulate the release of dopamine from synaptic vesicles or turnover in the caudate nucleus

**[Long-term efficacy and safety of modafinil (PROVIGIL®) for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness associated with narcolepsy (2000)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389945700000319)**

This is the Mitler et al cited in Minzenberg et al, 2008. The protocol varied but the majority of patients received a dosage of 400 mg/day and showed a significant improvement at week 2 and remained at that level through week 40.

**Discussion: Pharmacokinetic Tolerance**

Tolerance could be caused by an increase in elimination rate after long-term use. This would produce a shorter half-life and increase the first-pass effect, reducing bioavailability.

Apparently, Modafinil is metabolised on the P450 path by CYP3A4. Modafinil also induces CYP3A4, meaning that it increases the speed of its own metabolism. This could potentially cause it to be eliminated more quickly after long-term use. The pronounced interaction Modafinil has with the oral contraceptives ehinylestradiol and triazolam through CYP3A4 induction [(Robertson et al, 2002)](http://www.nature.com/clpt/journal/v71/n1/pdf/clpt20027a.pdf) lends credibility to this. Of note, too, is that [Robertson et al, 2002](http://www.nature.com/clpt/journal/v71/n1/pdf/clpt20027a.pdf) discovered a stronger induction in intestinal than hepatic CYP3A4.

On the other hand, [Minzenberg et al](http://www.nature.com/npp/journal/v33/n7/pdf/1301534a.pdf) describes both the metabolism through the P450 path and the induction of CYP3A4 as relatively minor effects, making it unlikely they would dominate amide hydrolysis.
Also, any pharmacokinetic tolerance mechanism would reduce the effectiveness of all of Modafinil's effects and should have been picked up in clinical studies.

Overall, a metabolism/induction feedback of CYP3A4 seems possible, in principle; but would imply a fairly serious omission in the literature. If this is the mechanism, tolerance could be reversed by supplementation with a CYP3A4 inhibitor such as bergamottin (grapefruit juice) or milk thistle. Alternatively, [Robertson et al](http://www.nature.com/clpt/journal/v71/n1/pdf/clpt20027a.pdf) discovered a stronger induction in intestinal than hepatic CYP3A4. If sublingual bioavailability is sufficient, it could bypass both intestinal breakdown and the first-pass effect.

On a side note, apparently Modafinil is water insoluble and mostly lipid insoluble. I was unable to find any information on its sublingual bioavailability.

**Discussion: Pharmacodynamic Tolerance**

Despite its dopaminergic effects, it is extremely well established that Modafinil does not exhibit the addictiveness of other dopaminergic drugs (e.g amphetamine). Also dopaminergic tolerance should affect Modafinil's eugeroic effects, which should have been picked up in clinical studies. Dopaminergic tolerance (e.g dopamine receptor down regulation) is an unlikely tolerance mechanism.

Beyond this, the pharmacology of Modafinil is complex and not entirely understood. However, it is possible some mechanisms responsible for its nootropic effects develop tolerance and were not discovered in clinical studies.

If you have any insignt into possible tolerance mechanisms in GABA/glutamate, gap junctions etc., I would be interested.

**Conclusion**

Above, I proposed a number of explainations for the discrepancy between anecdotal reports and the literature.

1. It remains possible the anecdotal reports of tolerance are incorrect or inaccurate. Though the number of reports (Google it for yourself!) makes this is unlikely.

2. Doses typical for nootropic effects (50-200mg/day) are at or below those observed in clinical studies to be well-tolerated for long periods of time.

3. Tolerance specific to nootropic effects remains a possibility. But anecdotal reports include a cessation of eugeroic effects.

4. I couldn't find any interactions that could explain the discrepancy.

5. Clinical studies missing the tolerance entirely remains a very real possibility, especially if only certain people develop tolerance. Modafinil wasn't clinically shown to universally cure narcolepsy etc., just that it had significant effects on most people that were stable after several weeks.

6. Sleep deprivation is a likely explanation. Many of the anecdotal reports concern people who have used Modafinil to go for long periods of time with little or no sleep.

The CYP3A4 feedback is the only substantive tolerance mechanism I have found, however it is only hypothetical. Several [people](https://www.google.com/search?q=modafinil+tolerance+milk+thistle) have presented milk thistle as a cure for tolerance. In general, it should increase the half-life somewhat, but it is unknown if it would otherwise reduce tolerance. This should be straightforward to experimentally test.

**If you have any suggestions, hypotheses, anecdotal observations or insights into Modafinil's pharmacology, please tell me. I'm interested both for academic and pragmatic reasons.**

I made an epically dumb mistake today, but one which may ultimately benefit science. Long story short, I made a terrible, terrible dosing oversight with noopept powder, and so far I'm not dead and feel fine. Actually, I feel completely normal. I believe this is the highest recorded human dose of noopept in the history of, uh, noopept. I'll keep redditors updated on any side-effects over the next few weeks. I'm expecting a good deal of brain fog and who knows what else, but so far so good.


DISCLAIMER: Do not take my blunder as grounds to replicate. I acknowledge that there may be long-term consequences in this, and I'm very, very lucky that I didn't make the same mistake with something more dangerous. I think. And it's my own fault-- an inexplicable lapse of common sense-- and not any misleading information on the part of the supplier... So, safe or not, don't be like me.


I'll cut to the chase: I took somwhere between 1.5 grams to 3.0 grams of noopept today. Fuck me, right. The noopept arrived yesterday (20g) via New Star Nootropics. The first shipment was mishandled by the carrier and they sent another for free, expedited, free of charge, no questions asked. Excellent service, containers sealed, neat, perfect. Nothing but good things there. I also received a much larger jar of aniracetam. The shipment came with two scoopers, a larger one for the aniracetam (.6 to 1.1 grams, depending on powder density) and a microscoop for the noopept (10-15 mg). The And here's where the catastrophe occurred: the microscoop is so tiny, I didn't even notice it was a ""scooper"" at all. I thought it was some kind of weird instrument that smartdrug people use, like a pick or something. Who knows what you guys are into, my own nootropic experience is limited. Retarded, I know. This happened this morning as I was running late to work. So I opened the package, took a quick look, and ignored the appropriate scooper, assuming the 1 gram scoop was meant for the noopept. Had I read the specifications closely, I would have realized that this measuring distinction was spelt out clearly in the provided receipt. So, like a fucking imbecile, I put two large scoops of noopept (about 1-2 grams, I think, depending on powder density) in water and shot it down. Also 300mg alpha gpc. Then I went to work, taught 3 classes, felt fine, and took another scoop (.5 to 1 gram, I think, depending on powder density). I thought I was taking 30mg for the day. Not the case. In my best estimation, it came out at anywhere from 1.5 to 3.0 grams, assuming equal densities between products. Yep. You're reading it right. This is one for the books.


After the third scoop, I'm thinking wow, this shit must be more expensive than I thought because there's a substantial chunk of product gone already. Then a dreadful foreboding took hold. I jumped online and put the pieces together. Sweet creeping Jesus-- fuck, balls, shit, fuck, etc. Three more classes in front of me and a good chance I'd need to be hospitalized by lunch. Or so I thought. After the initial wave of panic wore off, I took an inventory of my physical and mental state and realized that I was fine. I took a long walk at break, calmed down, and got through my classes with some added focus, no anxiety, no problems. 


I've had some limited experience with ratecams and other nootrpics. Currently I teach full-time and I'm in a demanding grad school program, so any mental edge helps. I've taken a previous cycle of noopept with good results, in pill form, and today's effects are basically on par with what I've experienced at my highest doses of 50-60 mg in the past: alertness, vivid colors, smoother cognition, sense of well-being, etc. Today I was pretty drowsy after school, but, again, on par with what I experienced in the initial phases of my last cycle. I slept for about 3 hours (a very long nap for me) and had incredibly vivid, euphoric dreams. I was in the clouds. After waking up, I felt completely normal. It's been about 12 hours since last administration, and nothing negative yet, not even a headache (I took another alpha gpc). I do feel alert and music is more interesting than usual, but nothing crazy or pronounced. Also, libido is way up. Way up. But all things considered, today's superhuman dose feels essentially the same to me as a higher civilian dose of about 50 mg or so.


What does this mean? Well, it's only one guy's account, but provided I'm not dead or in deep psychosis tomorrow, this should further support the relative safety of noopept (at least in the short term). Maybe the body can only process so much (making mega-dosing unnecessary)? I don't know, just speculating. I have no expertise in this area whatsoever, so it would be cool if some of reddit's experts could weigh in. It would also be good to know if I'm in any mortal danger. At the very least, today's inconceivable mishap might be able to shed some light on our understanding of this mysterious compound. If I don't make it through the night tell the world my story.

**DO NOT** buy it right now. The people on longecity is having a group buy and will recieve and start testing it in a few weeks. You'll waste money (if it doesn't work) and possibly expose yourself to danger. Just be patient and we'll find out soon.

**Background**

There have been a few discussions on the internet about PRL-8-53, but few have tested. The compound was first created in 1974 by Dr. N. R. Hansl.  It is not structurally like anything that I know of, but I have very little knowledge of structures of nootropics. The compound is extremely under-researched and should only be taken with caution.

**Mechanism of Action**

Due to the drug being about 40 years old, the mechanism of action is most likely incomplete, but it seems to work in at least three different ways. Here is a quote from the study:


&gt;“Meets structural criteria required for interaction with cholinergic response in the experimental animal. The compound potentiates dopamine and causes partial inhibition of serotonin.”


1.	PRL-8-53s main mechanism of action seems to be by using the cholinergic system. This has been confirmed in test animals. An article however mentions ""making the brain more responsive to acetylcholine"", that does not explain the MoA though.


2.	It potentiates dopamine, which I would assume is by up regulating the receptors (i.e. more receptors). If the receptors becomes activated it might enhance LTP and plasticity.  This would explain why the study was earlier talking about protein synthesis (L-LTP) being needed for formation of new memories. Remember that this study was done in the 70’s and it was first in the 80’s that LTP was proven to be needed for memory formation in vivo. Dopamine has also partially been linked to the cognitive decline, PRL-8-53 could thus help prevent aging decline of memory. 



3.	Partially inhibits serotonin (inhibits the transportation of serotonin is my guess). The study then claims that a reduction in serotonergic activity benefits the experimental animal and refers to two studies (Tenen, 1967; Schlesinger et al., 1968), I have not been able to find the full studies on them. 
He writes that the changes in neurotransmitters (more dopamine, less serotonin, more acetylcholine (?)) are favorable in humans and enhances cognition. 

**Benefits**

The study that was done looked at memory of words. The volunteers took a placebo or PRL-8-53 2-2.5 h before the test was conducted. 12 one-syllable, three- or four-letter words were used. They did get to hear the words nine times and were then tested 24h after and then 1 (4 days?) week after. The results showed statistical difference between both groups, ranging from p = 0.001 to p = &gt;0.05 (lower p = better). The more obvious differences were seen in the low performers, overall (all the results together) PRL-8-53 produced a statistical significant result with a p-value of 0.02. but not in the high performance group. Those who were older than 30 responded better than the younger part. 

Actual increase instead of just p-value:

http://i.imgur.com/cvywEIS.png - Population 1A, everyone.

http://i.imgur.com/nTgW7xO.png - Population 1B, those who scored low.

http://i.imgur.com/lI4LexS.png - Population 1C, those who scored high.

http://i.imgur.com/rEmIPI8.png - Population 1D, the older population.

Gross Score = Number of words recalled.

Discrete Score = Number of words recalled in correct order.

There was also a test on motor control. The method used was that the volunteers had to fit a stylus three times in a row into seven holes (which gradually got smaller and smaller). If the stylus touched the side of the holes, it got reported. The group slightly better results, but not significant.

A visual reaction test was used too, which also produced improvement. The improvement was not significant compared to placebo.

Another test where the subjects had to remove seven, add one, remove seven, add two, remove seven, add three (then start with removing one again) from a specific number is also claimed to have been done, I have not seen any study on it though. 

There are some claims that are not proven in any studies, the most talked about is an increase of about 200% in the digit span memory.  

The patent says 

&gt;""Additionally, the compounds of formula I are useful as cholinergic and spasmolytic agents.” 

The claim about it being a spasmolytic agent might not be correct if the motor control test failed. (This is my own speculation, I'm guessing it's wrong because I'm not really sure how I'm thinking here).

**Dosage**

In the only study I've found, the dosage was 5 mg, the compound is fairly safe, so bigger dosages might work.

The patent does say that the oral dosages range from 0.01-4mg/kg (most preferable 0.05-1.2mg/kg), the study used no such dosages however. 

**Toxicity**

Oral LD50 860mg/kg in mice (about 70mg/kg for a 60 kg adult)

Blood pressure in dogs was not affected in a dose of 8mg/kg (4 mg/kg in humans)

Reduced motor activity in mice and rats by 50% in 160mg/kg (13 mg/kg and 26 mg/kg in human dosage)

Does not potentiate amphetamine nor have any stimulatory effects like amphetamine.

No side-effects has been reported.

Reproduction has also been studied, there was no case of malformation of any form for two generations of offsprings. 

Cancer risk is unknown, but if no malformation happened with two generations born on it, I doubt there is a cancer risk.


**Testing**

If anyone get their hands on it (which should be very soon) I propose that it is tested a lot to prove or disprove the claims. 

The first test that should be used is dual-n-back, this to test the working memory. A baseline should be established before ever taking the compound, I suggest playing it for two weeks a few times daily so you reach a plateau. Comparing the acute and chronic effects could also be of interest.

Another way would be to use http://www.cambridgebrainsciences.com/ (one of each type) and use the same schedule as used for dual-n-back. Digit span would most likely be the most interesting to prove or disprove the claims of an increase of around 200%. 

Another unique way to test it would be with IQ tests before and after. Do a maximum of one before (and not a random one on the internet) and then do another whilst being on PRL-8-53.

**EDIT:** mistermojorizin suggested ABAB testing instead, which makes way more sense. You would do as I've written on all, but then add two more tests. One where you are in withdrawal (i.e. stop taking it) and one when you use the compound again.

Blind testing would be awesome too, no idea how to do it though, hope gwern can give suggestions.

Take Oxiracetam for example:
Wikipedia:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxiracetam

Erowid:

https://www.erowid.org/smarts/oxiracetam/oxiracetam.shtml

You will find the Wikipedia page being extremely brief, and the Erowid page being devoid of any experience and almost any content. With the exception of Piracetam this seems to be the norm.

I'm making this post as an appeal to the Nootropics community of reddit to contribute to these sites (in particular to Wikipedia). There are several benefits of this:

* Scientific supplement questions can be linked to a well cited Wikipedia article
* Qualitative supplement questions can be answered with a link to a page with many qualitative reports 
* The FAQ will be much more useful if all or most of the Nootropics discussed linked to an informative Wikipedia article and experience reports
* Wikipedia and Erowid^[[1]](https://www.erowid.org/general/about/about_faq.shtml#traffic) have larger audiences then this subreddit
* Reduced need to repost answers to common questions
* Less threads dealing with the postings of experiences (not that these are bad, but they get lost amongst the other threads)
* A more permanent dissemination of information
* People searching for a substance will likely check these two sources first before going to forums (which could easily contain misleading or false information)


Some people may counter that if I personally believe this why am I not editing Wikipedia and submitting experiences to Erowid? The short answer is I already do to a limited extent, but what I can contribute is nothing compared to what the Reddit community can contribute as a group. These sites like Reddit survive through the small contributions of a large number of people, and that is what makes them useful.

Some possible starting points are the pages linked to on the following Wikipedia pages:

I purchased 100g of Aniracetam a few weeks ago from BYOB.  I'd had good experiences with Ani before and I knew what quality Ani looked like.  The stuff I received didn't exactly have the look or texture I expected.  It also dissolved readily in water which should not happen.  I bought replacement Aniracetam from Elevated Labs (which had exactly the properties I expected to see) and made a quick comparison album.

http://imgur.com/a/RM9uT

Its pretty clear there are some big differences between the two brands, I'd just advise people to try to avoid BYOB for Aniracetam at the very least.  I can't say anything about their other nootropics but I got ripped off so I've lost my trust of all their products.

Edit: From what I've gathered, this seems to be an isolated case with batch 12-08-13.  If you've bought from them recently go and check the batch number on the label ([Should be on the left] (http://imgur.com/Udvqa)).  Try contacting support@healthsupplementwholesalers.com or p.m. i11uminati (the owner of Health Supplement Wholesalers) with your batch number to work out a refund/replacement.  It seems very likely this is just a matter of mislabeling.

Edit 2: I think its likely the substance packaged was actually Oxiracetam, I coincidentally purchased a small sample Oxiracetam from BYOB the same time I purchased the Aniracetam.  I hadn't used it yet and put it away, but comparing the two they look identical, dissolve at the same rate, and tastes almost exactly the same (mildly bitter / sweet).  Other people posing in the thread with ""Aniracetam"" from BYOB that looked similar to mine describe the same Oxiracetam-like properties, some from the same batch.  I think its extremely likely at this point there was no shady business on BYOB's end and it was a mis-labeled batch that got sent out.  I guess I should consider myself lucky, Oxi at Ani's price is a great deal.

Edit 3:  I thought I'd do a final edit.  Health Supplement Wholesalers quickly shipped out to me a new package of Aniracetam.  Just to clear any doubts of the actual quality of their Aniracetam I redid my previous tests.  I also added a visual comparison at the end of BYOB Oxiracetam and the ""Aniracetam"" I received before.

It was effective at increasing energy levels and balancing my hormones out. It seemed like a good supplement without side effects. I had one of my friends try some one day and he proceeded to get sick and throw up for 5 hours. It was very strange; almost like an allergic reaction. I felt fine, and did not have any issues, so I thought it was just him.

Then about a week ago my stomach started hurting. It was just low level stomach upset at first. Then a few days later it hit me. I went from low level stomach upset to curled up in a ball on the floor with stomach spasms. I passed out from the pain, and woke up 4 hours later. The major pain had subsided, but my stomach was still very upset. I figured I have food poisoning and gave it a few days. It has now been a week and a half, and the stomach pain has not subsided.

I think I have narrowed it down to SBIO (small intestinal bacterial overgrowth). All of my symptoms fit, and I am pretty sure it was caused by the raw maca powder. Either the enzymes left in the root caused it, or there was bacteria in the powder. After doing some more research, raw maca powder can cause digestive issues if the starches are not gelatinized. Basically the powder needs to be cooked at around 300*F to break down the enzymes. I have been treating it with various methods, but it does not seem to be improving. Eating any dairy, fiber, sugars, etc makes the pain come back. If I fast, the pain stays at bay. If I eat spicy food, then surprisingly the pain only comes back a little. I have been trying digestive enzymes, probiotics, and activated charcoal to varying degrees of success. I think I am going to have to go on neomycin to beat it. I hate going on antibiotics!

So be careful if you are using raw maca. I would suggest baking it at 300*F for at least 30 min before ingesting it. You can also buy gelatinized maca for a little more. There's also a chance that there was bacteria on the maca when I got it. Who knows what goes on in the packing center in Peru. Cooking it should kill the bacteria as well.

FYI: I don't know if it matters or not but I'm a veteran with PTSD. 

The VA was providing me with Provigil but stopped about 2 years ago.

They were honest in telling me it was because of the prohibitively high price.

But they do write scripts for me which I can fill it on my on.

Filling my prescription at the local pharmacy has been incredibility expensive.

But I have hypersomnia and it was either pay the price or have no quality of life.

Finding this sub reddit and discovering mymodafinil.net was a great thing for me.

So far, I have ordered Modafinil three times and Armodafinil one time, from them.

I find their Modafinil is equivalent to Provigil; no difference; same, same.

I am now on my 3rd day of using Armodafinil.


Armodafinil -

Cons:

Doesn't last as quite as long for me… maybe an hour or two less.

I am a bit anxious.

When it stops working for the day… boom, big drop off.

Slight headache. I'm not completely sure that it is caused by the Armodafinil, though.


Pros:

I wake up feeling refreshed. That is something I never got from Modafinil.

Until I took Modafinil in the morning, I was exhausted.  I always felt like I had gotten less than an hour's sleep.

Of course, Modafinil pulls me right out of that in about 17 minutes.

Wakefulness, alertness and focus seems exactly the same as with Modafinil.


Modafinil -

Cons: 

For me: None, except it does not deliver the refreshed felling when I wake up in the morning that I just discovered with Armodafinil. 


Pros:

Smoother.

When it stops working for the day, it's a more fluid transition.

Although, Modafinil is not been proven to treat depression, I have weaned myself off of antidepressants.  I've been on about all of them. The last one was Celexa (Citalopram).
That was about 6 months ago and so far, so good.
I had tried to stop taking them many times before with really bad results.

I will provide updates to this post (using the edit feature) for the next few days.


**Update 4th Day:**

Still a bit on edge/anxious.  But not too much. I can easily handle it. 

I have noticed, I'm clinching my teeth/jaw at times.  
I've had this reaction with antidepressants (especially with Celexa *Citalopram*) before but never with Modafinil.

I'm moderately more talkative.

Drop off of effect is not as drastic as days 1 through 3.

No headache.

I am still waking up refreshed.  This is a HUGE plus, for me.

Energy level and motivation seems to be somewhat higher than with Modafinil.

Also, Armodafinil cuts my appetite a little more than Modafinil.

**Update 5th Day:**

Light nausea early in the day.

Still mildly anxious.

Drop off still rather sudden.

Still waking up refreshed.


**Update 6th Day:**

Tolerance break today.


**Update 7th Day:**

Irritable, on edge.

Stomach in a knot.

About 3 years ago, I experimented with LSD and psilocybin mushrooms. Unfortunately for me, I noticed mild HPPD (visual anomalies while sober) so I immediately stopped all psychedelic use (and with it, my spiritual quest). The visuals gradually decreased over the next few weeks and was completely gone within two months.

I found out about nootropics and decided to give it a try after doing some research. I felt that Noopept's safety profile was the same as piracetam's and decided to try it out. I dosed approximately 15mg the first day. The effects were mild but I definitely noticed somewhat increased motivation. Over the next three days, I took 20mg once daily. 

On the fourth day, my HPPD symptoms came back. I see what I can best describe as ""static"" and the edges on objects slightly waving in and out. When I look at bright objects (particularly the sky during the day) I see small fractals and geometric shapes spinning in the center of my vision. They aren't severe enough to impair my driving but I don't like that my perception of reality is inconsistent. These are the exact same visuals I saw when I had HPPD from before.

Hey _____ are you familiar with nootropics?
What would you make of a pill ingredient list like this? 

https://www.onnit.com/alphabrain-science/

Reply:

I wasn't familiar with nootropics, but obviously I am familiarizing myself now.
Nootropics are cognitive enhancers that are nontoxic. I've only gotten started at looking at the evidence for the efficacy of these ingredients, but in general, combination products are never tested in trials, so you have to look at the evidence for each ingredient separately. 
The major problem with the ingredient list is that they are mistaking proposed mechanisms of action (how something might work) for evidence of efficacy (that a product does work). 
Normally, medical research aims at curing or controlling a medical condition, like alzheimers or dementia. Giving a normal, healthy person a drug or chemical that helps alzheimers or dementia isn't supported by research that shows efficacy in alzheimer or dementia patients. 
Aside from this, the cost-benefit ratio has to be addressed, and this product appears to be very expensive. But, I'll try to go through the ingredients over the next couple days and give you an honest appraisal.


GPC Choline 100mg
I found evidence from the 1980s that increased choline intake did not affect age-related memory loss (1). In a cohort-analysis (an off-shoot of the Framinham Stroke Prevention Study), a higher dietary choline intake was associated with an increase in verbal memory and verbal learning(2). Cohort studies aren't the best because they don't randomize people. A quick example is that the people with higher dietary intake of choline might have a higher nutritional awareness and be more intelligent...
Until there is a randomized controlled trial that compares a specific dosage of choline to placebo, there is not sufficient evidence to take a choline supplement.

Huperzine A 250mcg
The only study to show any effect on mental function in healthy people was done on middle-school chinese children. 34 matched pairs complaining of poor memory showed some memory improvement after 4 weeks of taking huperzine A 100mcg twice daily (3). All the trials done with this medication were short courses, so the effect may wear off because of Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) up-regulation. Possible adverse effects of AChE include: nausea, sweating, diarrhea, dizziness, muscle cramping, high blood pressure, blurred vision, hyperactivity, anorexia, and decreased heart rate.

Vinpocetine 5mg
There are two studies that were designed to test the effects of Vinpocetine on memory. Both were done by the same university department in 1985 and 1987. Both studies were only done in women, both studies were short-term (3 days) and both studies were done in small samples of 8-12 people (4,5). The only statistically signifigant difference was in the steinberg test, testing reaction times, showing a reduction in reaction time in recalling items in a memory set. The reduction appeared dose-related, with 40mg producing a larger reduction compared to 10 and 20mg. The reduction in memory recollection was ~180ms. There was no statistically significant difference with the 10 and 20mg doses (4). Therefore 5mg should have no measurable effect on any memory or cognitive performance.

As you all know in 1985 scientists at the University of California in Berkeley published anatomical studies of slivers of Einstein's brain after counting the different cells in the organ. They found the only difference between his brain and those of dead doctors was a greater ratio of glial cells to neurons.

""We know from animal studies that as you go from invertebrates to other animals and primates, as intelligence increases, so does the ratio of glial cells to neurons,"" said Professor Volterra, whose study appears in the journal Nature Neuroscience. This quotation begs the question, Does intelligence increase when the glial cell count increases or do the amount glial cells increase when intelligence is gained. This question is the basis for all physiological questions existing in the nootropics community, among others.

""These findings about Einstein's brain are intriguing, but alone they prove nothing -- they are observations not conclusions. ""It remains a difficult task to provide a link between [astrocytes and] genius,"" says Colombo, from the analysis of ""a single, aged, postmortem brain,"" but still, these findings provoked expanded thinking about the possibility that information processing, cognition, and human intelligence could involve cells other than neurons. Now a team of neuroscientists has such proof."" [here](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-douglas-fields/unusual-brain-cell-astroc_b_2810871.html)

Continuing my research, I came across a study [here](http://www.ffcr.or.jp/zaidan/ffcrhome.nsf/7bd44c20b0dc562649256502001b65e9/ac27905ddbeb8e354925749000273016/$FILE/213(7)3.pdf) with the conclusion that royal jelly stimulates neurogenesis and glial cell production through the action of decenoic acid (HDEA). Now, take note that the central nervous system including brain and spinal cord is composed of 3 kinds of cells, i.e. neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. This study claims decenoic acid (HDEA) promoted generation of all three types of cells composing the CNS in a mature brain.

Furthermore, another study I found [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15849420) concludes that, RJ via oral administration selectively facilitates the mRNA expression of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). 

But, the active ingredient that causes all of these effects, degrades overtime (fast) in the commercial Royal Jelly. I found out the active ingredient is royalactin as studied [here](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v473/n7348/full/nature10093.html) In summery royalactin, is responsable for the growth, not much else in Royal Jelly. So... where do we get royalactin or create a synthetic derivative?

I see the nootropic community is starting to focus on the incremental, long term effects and the ""drugs"" that increase NGF and BDNF, like noopept. This is IMO, where we need to be headed. Anyway, does anyone have any experience with Royal Jelly or increasing glial cells? What do you know about GDNF and how to increase it?

Normally it would take 10 days to solve, further it might be a drug INTERACTION problem.

This is a divide and conquer approach.

Let's assume you have 10 supplements you want to resolve.

vitamin1
vitamin2
vitamin3
vitamin4
vitamin5
vitamin6
vitamin7
vitamin8
vitamin9

... now lets say the problem is caused by vitamin3.

What you do is split the set in half on the first day and try just the following set.

vitamin0
vitamin1
vitamin2
vitamin3
vitamin4

You still have the headache.

so you split that in half again.

vitamin0
vitamin1
vitamin2

The headache goes away that day.  So you KNOW that it isn't in this set but you're closer to finding the problem.

Now try 

vitamin3
vitamin4

BINGO.  Got the headache again.

Now try just:

vitamin3

NAILED IT. The problem was vitamin3.

Now you can go back to your original set but just exclude vitamin3 to test your hypothesis.  

If you want to be VERY rigorous you could double blind yourself in these experiments.  

For long term side effects you can do the same thing but take each iteration and do it across a couple days.

1358102772.0,46,self.Nootropics,16i32o,Finally weaned myself completely off my pharmaceutical poison bath and onto a new stack. Have never felt better! :D,GeneStealer,51,5,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/16i32o/finally_weaned_myself_completely_off_my/,"**Warning: Long and mostly self-serving post :)**

So I'd been taking pharmaceuticals for probably around 3-4 years now, mostly on, though sometimes off and the best they ever did for me was zombify and desensitize myself so much to the world that it placed me within I suppose a state of stasis where nothing good happened nor nothing bad really. I've always had powerful emotions so this artificial cage turned me into something absolutely horrifying. 

To give some context, I started taking prozac at age 19 with some benzodiazepines for anxiety. This was during a rough transitional stage of my life to an unhealthy college where I did a lot of drinking at first. I joined a fraternity for some reason and things gradually got worse as I added marijuana and illegally purchased adderall to ""self-medicate"" or just get high. Overall, the absolute stupid misuse of drugs in my case messed my brain up considerably and I ended my second year with a psychosis, agoraphobia, and depression while almost dying due to taking an obscene amount of stimulants on a 20 hr nonstop drive back from school. I was an idiotic, decaying, naive, piece of work, end of story. This was definitely the lowest I've ever been.

So I see a psychiatrist, who low and behold besides asking me about my dreams and various other non helpful things (the only professional that ever helped me was a COGNITIVE THERAPIST as they actually make you change your behavior rather than peddle drugs at you) gave me antipsychotics that I was on for about 9 months (olanzapine). This stuff is the definition of pharmaceutical zombification, at least for me, and I felt like it was giving me a chemical lobotomy as I became pacified, mechanically content, dull, and rather lifeless. While I did this, I tried to go back to school but was unsuccessful and then began the process of picking up various low end minimum wage jobs for as long as I could hold them...

Then out of the blue, some ray of light shone upon my tattered being and mind and I saw a cognitive therapist who completely changed my lifestyle patterns (sleep, diet, exercise, ways to deal with negative thoughts and energy) and things started changing slowly. I gradually felt well enough to slowly get off the drugs I was otherwise prescribed and by this point I had taken everything...prozac, cymbalta, wellbutrin, Concerta, Strattera for mental health issues and then I forgot to mention I was also having sometimes daily migraines so I tried everything for that as well: calcium channel blockers, anticonvulsants (topamax), imitrix, butterbur extract, ranexa, anti-inflammatory drugs and herb extracts, beta blockers, etc...

But about one week ago I finally completely freed myself of all of these and just started taking supplements and living healthily, and by Ford it's like this curtain has been lifted, and while I may be more moody, I'm also more human and subject to the beautiful highs and lows that this brings. I recently also started a non gluten diet and am in the process of being tested for celiac so this could be a large confounding factor as well.

I've been back in school now for 6 months with a new degree, Computer Science, and a whole new perspective on the world, which I was lucky enough to be able to attain due to the outstanding support from my friends and family. If all goes well and the migraines and good vibes continue I feel very positive about the coming months / years! :D
___
But the actual supplement and stack list: 

    -L-theanine (300-600mg a day usually taken over 3x)
    -Bacopa extract (300-600mg over 3x)
    -A pre-made stack I got at my local vitamin shop called Maxilife Choline Cocktail II by Twinlab (taken 2-3x a
    day) : 
      750mg choline
      425mg guarana
      12 mcg Huperzine A
      ~7mg CoenzymeQ10
      50 mg L- Carnitine
      50mg DMAE
      ~63mg Phosphatidylserine Complex
      and various other supplments (mainly vitamins at healthy levels) like 
      A,C,E,B6,Folic Acid, Pantothenic Acid, and an obscene amount of B12 
      (500mcg)

From my anecdotal experience, I feel more focused, emotionally stable and able to deal with frustrating situations, clear headed, sharper, energized, and overall just plain happier. I just wanted to share my experience in case anyone could relate, had advice, or might find this helpful. I don't want to be the one to say that pharmaceuticals are all bad and that you should stop taking them but in my case where I slowly, carefully did this and replaced them with healthier alternatives, my life became all the better for it.

I am attempting to create a more active vibrant community on /r/brain1up and can use your help! Here is an explanation of my idea for the subreddit: 

""I created this subreddit because I'm interested in investigating methods of improving the brains cognitive ability and overall health to reach peak performance (and maybe even beyond). 

The discovery of neuroplasticity has revolutionized our understanding of the brain. There are numerous devices and methods that claim they can improve your cognitive function. This subreddits purpose is to cut through the crap and find what devices and methods actually work. It's sort of like the idea behind the subreddit /r/nootropics, but its focus is on methods and devices rather then supplements and drugs.

What do I mean by methods and devices?

-Brain foods (diet) http://www.dirjournal.com/health-journal/top-10-brain-foods/

-Better habits (regular sleep schedule, drink enough water, regular exercise, etc).

-Nike strobe goggles shown to  increase short term visual memory (for at least 24 hours) http://mashable.com/2012/07/30/nike-strobe-light-glasses/

-Neurofeedback/biofeedback machines (there are hundreds of different ones)


The methods behind how this subreddit ""cuts through the crap"" is yet to be determined. I put some of my ideas of how to do it below. 

**Here are some general guidelines on how to do that:**

-Identify the claim being made then ask... Are the scientific methods used to validate the claim reliable? How was the experiments/tests constructed? 

-Who is making the claim? Are they trustworthy? Do they have an agenda? (look for the money).

It has been amazing, and I'm excited to continue my nootropic journey. The only nootropic experience I have is Piracetam from a few years ago - I remember it having an effect, but it was not nearly as 'mind blowing' as this. 

The current nootropics at my disposal are:
Noopept, Centrophenoxine, Oxiracetam, Pramiracetam, and Piracetam. Nefiracetam and Aniracetam are in the mail being delivered right now. 


I started the morning with about 400mg of Oxiracetam, 3g of Piracetam (currently in loading phase) and 400mg of Pramiracetam. I didn't feel any 'different' until about five minutes before I left the house - as I took a few bites from my leftovers I could feel the tastes of each individual vegetable from last night's cooking burst in my mouth. The flavor of green beans, carrots, peas and corn were screaming at me. It was almost as if each individual vegetable was yelling, ""DO YOU TASTE ME? I'M HERE, AND I'M DELICIOUS!"". I asked my boyfriend to taste the green beans and ask him if they tasted any different - he sort of looked at me funny. ""Aren't these the best green beans you've ever tasted?"". They didn't taste particularly amazing, but they *tasted* in a way that I've never tasted before. 

I opened the door and a flood of sensations entered my perception. I felt the cold air - the light was brighter than I remembered it to be, and the sounds of cars, the wind going through trees and birds chirping really disoriented me. I couldn't tell if I had ignored all of these things in the past, or if  the drugs were really helping me take everything in in a way that I have never really experienced. 

There is heavy construction going on in my neck of the woods in Atlanta. I started thinking about the best way to get somewhere and in my mind I could very clearly see a picture of the roads from my apartment to my school and all of the different best routes - I was visualizing my Android phone's GPS and going through the different ways to get to where I was going. I ended up getting to school faster than I normally would by going a route that I've never really thought of before. 

In class, learning really was a breeze. I wouldn't say that nootropics are helping me 'focus' as much as they are helping me be aware of where my focus is, and where it is not. After class I skimmed through a lengthy 90 page chapter in my Data Communications class for the first time in preparation for a quiz the next day. I hadn't seen any of the content before. The next day I had a quiz on the material and I made a perfect grade. I make very good grades normally, but I usually have to put in a lot more studying. When I studied the first time around, making connections with things was almost obvious. I was constantly thinking ""of course, that makes perfect sense, why wouldn't it?"". I used the quiz and the studying of the material as a sort of self-check on the nootropics ... and boy did it work. 

The first night after sleeping was amazing. I go to bed at around 11PM every night and wake up at 8AM. Waking up for me has sort of been like a slow boot-up process. I lay awake, check my phone, read any emails that may have come in overnight and then slowly start the process of getting up and getting ready for class. If waking up was like dealing with a Windows ME bootup process, waking up on nootropics was like having a Macbook Air (instant on). I woke up, my eyes were wide open - I was a little tired (reasonably, it was the morning) but I hopped up and my mind started racing on all of the things that had to get done. It wasn't an anxious ""oh I have so much to do"" but more a ""This is what I have to do, and this is the order I should do it in ... let's get started right now."" 

Needless to say that that morning started with another dose of nootropics. 

Last night my dreams were a little more bizarre. I remember becoming aware that I was dreaming - things were happening in my dreams which didn't make sense. I don't remember the exact details (if I wrote them down, I definitely would have). I remember thinking in my dream that all of my dreams are the product of my brain doing what it wants to do - that is all good and fine, but the way I react in dreams should not be determined by something other than my self. The subconcious brain influences the mind in its dreams -- that does not mean that I need to accept everything that happens. After that realization I began changing everything around me in the way that made the most sense. I suppose it was a lucid dream. 

All around, I just feel like a way more effective person. The last few days seem to have gone by fairly quickly because I have been very busy. School hasn't stressed me out in the least. *School stresses me out a lot sometimes ... I go to a good school and have a decent gpa*. I'm getting ready to start the design for the presentation of a very large project due early next week - I'm not stressed at all. I know that I have the abilities to do what is necessary. 

Mentally I feel like I'm on adderall but without any of the speediness, quickness, or shortness. I used to be prescribed Adderall (still have some laying around for finals week... don't think I'll need it now!). To me, adderall is way overkill and does way more harm than good. 

Anyway, I just wanted to sit down and type up a short experience report for you folks and see if this stuff sounds about right/normal. Maybe my brain was just a bit out of whack from my past (I used to do a lot of drugs back in high school. Lots of LSD, MDMA and other research chems). I would say I'm a reasonably successful person but I've had to work really hard to learn and do things ... in the last few days it seems like a big weight has been taken off of my shoulders and while I may still have to spend time working and studying, it is not nearly as difficult.

Oxiracetam: Very stimulating, motivating

Phenylpiracetam: Similar to (and plays well with) oxiracetam, best physical effects for exercise (and an actual performance enhancing drug), a lot like a ""clean"" amphetamine. My favorite all around, but can build short term tolerance if used daily

Modafinil: Like all day caffeine, but without the jitters

Adrafinil: Modafinil delayed an hour without a prescription

Caffeine: Good in low moderation, 5g puts you in a mental hospital (or coffin), low dose beta-blockers take away the shakes

Lucidril: Very mild stimulant properties

Sunifiram: If you don't get (possibly serious) side effects it is a good stimulant, synergy with Unifiram

Unifiram: Lifts your mood without much stimulation, synergy with Sunifiram

Methylene Blue: A mild stimulant that makes you piss green, stacks well

Niacinamide/Nicotinamide: Feels like a benzodiazepine, except mildly improves cognition and greatly improves acne

But exam time was coming up and I was getting nervous and looking for a quick fix; I ordered their focus blend and expedited the shipping a week and a half ago. 

Problems then arose:

* There wasn't a field available to insert my shipping address. It took my billing address as my shipping address, and so the order was sent (if it was sent at all) to my parent's house and not my own (it is an old credit card).

* I emailed customer service promptly to change the shipping address. I received an email from John Smith saying ""sure, your new address has been changed and your order has been updated"". Okay... why hasn't my order actually been updated then?

* It apparently shipped two days later, as the company was out of stock.

* I was assured it would arrive here today. *Assured*. No package in the mail yet.

* I've sent them an email a day for a week asking them why my shipping address hadn't been changed on the order receipt on their website. No response. 

Exams are next week, probably won't have any use for the blend anyway now. If my order doesn't come by the end of next week I am opening a claim with Paypal; a Paypal employee assured me today that it was fully within my rights to request a refund, especially as ""John Smith"" assured me the package would be delivered today.

I found this sub as part of my efforts to educate myself in the subject and to see what these substances could possibly do for me. After about 2 weeks of using a basic stack I can report some improvement, but would like to see what could be done to further improve my mental situation.

Edit 3/27: Doubled up on the Choline dosage today to about 500mg total, will see how the 3pm droop is affected.
After work:  Today turned out to be a non standard day, as I had to go out to demo some software to a prospect.

Time they invented the brain-interface-to-the-internet-Wi-Fi-chip. I would be on the road all the time. Reminds me of the 2 years I spent driving Semis. Absolutely loved the scenery.

Edit 3/28: Following the general advice I increased daily dosages for Choline to 2 x 300mg, Theanine to 2 x 200mg, and Pramiracetam to 2 x 400mg, along with the ingested 2 x 25mg Noopept and 1 x 500mg ALCAR.  I sup on coffee all day long. Felt somewhat dull this morning, but was able to work. Was also tough to get up. I am thinking of cutting the Trazodone back to 100mg to see if it could help with getting up more easily.
Tried Melatonin a while ago. Pretty awful results. Last thing I need in this world are vivid (remembered) nightmares in technicolor and over-active nasal erectile tissue starving me of oxygen in my sleep.

Update 3/29 am:  Somewhat sluggish this morning. I did cut back on the Trazodone, dreams slightly more vivid (and anxiety filled). Took 15mg Noopept, 300mg Choline and 300mg ALCAR, 200mg Theanine, 3 cups of coffee thus far. Having to drag motivation to work from deep within my psyche.

After reading pretty much every research papers on ampakine, I was finally convinced that these compounds were more than placebo. And it should be because pharmaceutical grade aniracetam cost a shitload of money. 

The first few days, I was disappointed because I didn't notice any effects.

But then on the third day, mother-of-god, I am speechless.

Let's start off with the fact that I'm no stranger to psychoactive substances.  Salvia, LSA, focalin, and a lot (A LOT) of DMT and mushroom, you name it. I can tell when I'm on something. 

Aniracetam straightup reminds me of a low dose of mushroom, benzo and amphetamine. I cannot believe that something like this doesn't have any major side effects or withdrawal (so far). 

Things actually started getting trippy when I was having a conversation with someone. Also, since finals are over, I should be curled up under the blanket, crying like a bitch from focalin withdrawal, drinking to wash the pain and emptiness away. 

Instead, aniracetam seems to have this similar effect to focalin in that it kills boredom, laziness and gives you a certain sense of purpose. I expected the effect to be long gone after the drug is metabolized but it seems to linger on the next day. 

Really, if this is placebo then it's some good placebo. If I don't have any major side effects within the next few weeks, I'll have to start looking for a good source on alibaba to import a few kg.

I switched to mate about a month ago because I was horrified at all the sugar I was consuming in my coffee every morning. I'm one of those guys who gets up on a day off and drinks nothing but coffee until 11:00 AM or so when I have brunch. I was introduced to mate by a Paraguayan friend last summer, so I thought I'd try it out now. I bought a bombilla (which was pretty damn expensive at $24, I might add) and tried to find a gourd but just ended up using a small mug, which works fine. The mate I have now is Guayaca brand, but I've tried several varieties.

The stuff is extremely easy to prepare: you put the bombilla in the mug, add two or three teaspoons of mate, and fill with hot (but not boiling) water. The beverage is strong and bitter, but I actually quite like it once I got used to it. Usually the drink is finished by the time it cools down, and then I top it up again with hot water and make a second infusion. This one is milder, but still quite nice. A third infusion is possible, but it's much weaker, but still okay if you just want a warm drink on a cold day.

Experience: Holy shit, this stuff is *way* stronger than coffee. I feel really great, energetic, and very positive and happy. I can write fluidly, read long texts, and pretty much do everything that strong coffee or tea help you do. Great for waking up in the morning. Considering the stuff also contains way more ""healthy"" chemicals than coffee or tea, I'm quite happy with it. One of the big, big advantages to mate over coffee or tea is that I can drink a bunch of it in the evening and still sleep well at night. This is fantastic, as it's usually in the evening that I want that extra pep to get something done, but tea and coffee (especially tea) will make it impossible for me to sleep for a few hours after drinking. Not so with mate, I sleep soundly immediately after.

The downsides: It's not quite as easy to port around as coffee in a travel mug, and the bombilla must be cleaned regularly. Some mate brands are much more powdery than others, which can clog the bombilla. Also, mate is more expensive than tea and more difficult to find in places that aren't specialty stores. Some of these boutique tea stores (David's Tea, Teavana, etc) charge an absolute arm and a leg for mate ($7 for 50g!), which is quite impractical. Maybe I can find a better vendor online.

Anyway, I just thought I'd post my experience to this subreddit to see if anybody else has made the switch. I still drink coffee now and then because I love it, but I'm consuming a *lot* less refined sugar now that I've switched to mate, and I really can't recommend the stuff enough.",,False,,t5_2r81c,False,,,True,t3_18rykh,http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/18rykh/thoughts_on_yerba_mate/,

Quite upset, I gave them the address of some family in a neighboring city, on December 24th. Once it got there, I could pick it up the next time I visited. The next day, they said they'd sent it out ASAP.

I wrote the doctor to see if he had any further comments. This is what he said:


XXXX,

   There are three peer reviewed scientific studies  published on D- and L- theanine, all from my research group.  They are: (1)  K. H. Ekborg-Ott, et al. J. Agri. Food Chem. 45 (1997) 353-363,  (2)  M. J. Desai and D. W. Armstrong, Rapid Comm. Mass Spectrom. 18 (2004) 251-256, and (3)   M. J. Desai, et al. Chirality 17 (2005) 154-162.  

The first two papers outline the first and new ways to separate and analyze D- and L- theanine.  The first paper then analyzes the theanine in a variety of teas (the natural L-theanine was dominant, and both black and green teas had relatively high amounts of theanine.  

The second study looked at the composition of D- and L- theanine in commercial preparations.  Some were found to be mainly the L-theanine and others were racemic theanine (i.e., the 50:50 mixture of D- and L- theanine.  It is my opinion that products should at least be labeled correctly as to what they contain.  

The third study looked at the pharmacokinetics of D- and L- theanine in rats.  It was found that they were different from one another and therefore are biologically different.  The introductions of all three papers review the background and history of theanine.

I know there have been minor threads on this before, but I've never seen it resolved with satisfaction: Is nicotine (delivered by chewing nicotine gum) a good and reliable way to achieve cognitive enhancement? 

Some reasons I think it might be: 
1. It's a stimulant which, let's face it, a lot of us need to get boring and challenging work done. But (1a) it has a relatively short half-life, meaning that it may not detract from sleep quality as other stimulants do and 'tolerance' can be restored more quickly, and (1b) it doesn't induce dopamine-byproduct toxicity like amphetamines.  
2. My understanding is that nicotine also acts on the nicotinic/acetylcholine system, which suggests it could improve the rate of assimilation of new learning in addition to improving the motivation to learn. I've even read some surprising/counterintuitive claims that nicotine even *up*regulates nicotinic/acetylcholine receptors over the long term (not a biochemist or psychopharmacologist by any stretch) am confused by the theoretical basis for this.  
3. Subjectively, I really like the feel of nicotine -- I feel stimulated but also smooth and calm and at ease. It's my favorite thing for before a job interview or social occasion. 

Some downsides of nicotine: 
1. Vasoconstriction and maybe reduced sexual performance. 
2. Headaches and irritability when coming off it. 
3. I've seen some studies that find a strong association between smoking and long-term Alzheimer's risk. Correlation is not causation (and there's more in cigarettes than just nicotine) but still a reason for caution.

This could be life changing for me.,Lurkin_Dirty,59,17,79,http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/1e26u3/success_story_had_my_first_experience_with/,"Took some of the Pramiracetam this morning, my first taste of a nootropic outside of 5-HTP.  It was the worst tasting shit I ever tasted, it tasted like toxic waste,  but I liked that because I knew it must be some potent stuff.

1 hour in  I feel super jittery.  I got some restless leg syndrome and was uncomfortable.  I went to the gym asap to change my physiological state if you will.  Let me tell you I was on absolute fire.

My brain never has worked this well.  I was super focused. 

*A quick background on me:  I am naturally very introverted,  When I go to the gym I avoid people.  I will go the machines where people aren't around.  Just being in the proximity of strangers makes me very, very anxious.  I have been a shut in for the past 2-3 years.  I used to have dozens of friends, but my anxiety was crippling so life has been much easier, but a whole lot less fulfilling.*

Back to my day.  I usually pace back and forth in between sets when lifting.  I take dozens of trips to the water fountain; I have always been like this.  I have a weird thing where I can't sit still no matter what I am doing.  I can't go to the movies.  Any waiting in lines is very hard for me too.  But while at the gym I was a lot more calm and focused and could sit at a machine in between sets.  It felt awesome not feeling the need to move around.

I usually just wear my headphones and just try to focus on myself.  Almost in a  completely narcissistic way.  I am always constantly thinking about myself when at the gym and how people perceive me even though I am in good shape already.  I ignore everybody. This pramiracetam though man, had me in a complete different paradigm.  I had that feeling of wanting to engage people and strike up conversation.  By far my most talkative day at the gym ever in 5 years.  

**I was witty as fuck. I felt so sharp.  I made several people laugh when engaging them.  It was like that feeling you get when you are in that state at a party where you can do no wrong and have complete trust in your faculties and you are the fucking man- the life of the party.  There was hardly any background noise.  Thoughts were clearer.  A lot of times I was like, ""whoa where the fuck did that come from, Troy?  How did you come up with that so quick?""  Usually with me I always know the perfect thing to say like 5 minutes too late if at all because I am so cloudy.  But I was running on all cylinders yesterday for the first time in a long time.**

You can tell it wasn't placebo either, I felt too different for it to be so.

That feeling of being approachable is something I usually only feel when I am fucked up on alcohol or benzos.  This felt clean with no side effects.  I slept better than ever too.

Just awesome!

So some questions:

**1)**  I also got some choline and noopept.  When should I throw those in with the racetam?  Or should I take each on their own first to see how they effect me?

**2)** Is this as good as it gets?  I feel like my life is changing already and this can really enhance my social and work life.  Will tolerance take effect like most drugs and it is all down hill from here?

Say when I am out of this racetam would switching to a different racetam help switch undercut tolerance?

**3)** Any better way to take this?  It seriously tasted like alien piss and don't know if I can take it like that everyday.  Is just chasing with water the best and most potent way though?

BTW thanks everybody here who helped get me into this.  Without perusing this sub I doubt I would have ever invested in this or have taken it seriously.",,False,,t5_2r81c,1368180205.0,,,True,t3_1e26u3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/1e26u3/success_story_had_my_first_experience_with/,

Ampakines act as a positive allosteric modulator on the AMPA receptors. AMPA receptors are responsible for most of the fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. Ampakines do not agonize these receptors, rather they allow transmission to occur at a faster rate, compared to classic stimulants such as amphetamine which force stimulation to be made. The effect is a brain that is able to make connections at a faster rate *when it wants to be*.


Aniracetam was the first ampakine to be discovered, but it is not a very efficient stimulant. Nooglutil, however, has shown promising AMPA activity while still exerting effects of a racetam, such as dopamine modulation, anxiolytic funtionality, etc. etc.

* Brain fog all the time
* Frequent naps
* Hard to not be lazy

After

* No brain fog. Used to think I was just lazy or that everyone felt the same but they toughed it out.
* Instead of naps, I rest on my bed (back muscles get sore from sitting too long).
* Able to work longer. I've already cut out TV and games from my life. I work almost every hour I'm awake and have been able to increase my earnings because of this.
* Speech has improved A LOT. I can see how piracetam is a good supplement for pick up artists because you can think of witty things faster. Less slur in speech.
* Reading has improved; Easier to absorb. 
* More willpower. It makes such a big difference. I used enjoy doing nothing but now I can't stop working... my room is always clean.

Placebo effects

* I enjoy music more and hear instruments that I never paid attention to before.
* Vision improved. I look at the same shampoo bottle everyday and I can't read it any better than I could before. But it does feel like my vision improved when I'm not doing these tests. 

Supplements

* Piracetam + Alpha GPC 2:1 (1600mg piracetam twice/day)
* Theanine (200mg twice/day)
* Preworkout supplements (before workouts)
* Creatine
* Melatonin (at night)

Things I learned

* Get enough sleep. There's no better nootropic than wakefulness. 
* Work outside of home. I always go on reddit/lie in bed while working at home. Sometimes I go to reddit then close it right away because I know I've seen everything already. At a coffee shop, I don't dare to look like I'm being lazy.
* Don't workout too hard. I used to workout daily with heavy weights until my clothes are damp. Still working out daily but I reduce my workout by a few exercise and still gaining mass without the after-workout crash.
* Avoid starchy foods. I just eat veges and some meat/protein supplements. No more food coma!
* Be happy. Being happy makes you work faster, longer, and harder!

Modafinil

* I REALLY want to try Modafinil. I bought some from mymodafinil.com as recommended here but haven't received it after a month and a half. Their website now says that they don't ship to Canada and I haven't received any replies. Don't think I can get my money back and can't find another source that ships to Canada.

I realize this was a non-issue for some of you.  But for those of you that are concerned, here was New Star Nootropics response to me.  It is being posted with their permission.  Obviously, they cannot comment on the quality of Liftmode's products, so this is their experience.  The only editing I have done is to remove my name.


/u/SuckaWhat,

Thanks for your message. The manufacturer (T&amp;W group) sent us Tan colored Phenylpiracetam. I can't say anything about Liftmode, but I know that T&amp;W also supply a couple of other resellers in the USA. The batch arrived, and we were very upset to find that it was tan in color. There were small specs of white powder, and some darker specs that were more dark tan in color. We complained to the manufacturer, who suggested that we have it lab tested anyway because it was very pure. We didn't want to waste $2k on testing, so we pressed the issue. Our rep told us that the lab had him believe that the Phenyl could range between tan and white from batch to batch, which was really not something that we were happy believing. When he investigated further, he found that the lab was suffering from a bout of laziness, and were not finishing the purification process. He criticized their attitude and we received several apologies. They are currently purifying the product to a more satisfactory purity level. 

Note that purification is often the most time consuming element of a synthesis project, and it can be expensive as the overall weight is reduced, so it is often where unscrupulous manufacturers will attempt to cut corners. It works well when chemicals at 95% purity look the same as they do at 99% purity, but with Phenylpiracetam this just isn't the case. 

Hope that helps!

Robert

_____________________

I can confirm that my tan Phenylpiracetam from Liftmode is from T&amp;W.  I replied to Robert, thanking for the information and asked if he was comfortable with me posting this here.  This is his response:

/u/SuckaWhat, 

Sure, no problem at all! It would be most appreciated if you posted the reply to Reddit. I'll go ahead and add some extra info below, which you are free to post or not to post at your will.

A COA for a recent batch of Phenylpiracetam from T&amp;W has been floating around on the net, and if I remember correctly it states that the expected appearance of the chemical is ""tan to white"" with a minimum purity of 99%. The manufacturer created this COA based on their own production of the chemical, not on any externally published or accepted standards (if any exist). T&amp;W group are a very capable company, and I think the QA issue may only be an isolated incident. However, incidents like these do push us in the direction of domestic manufacturing. For example, we had a batch of Nefiracetam arrive from a different manufacturer that was completely unacceptable (brown chunks, strong solvent smell), and so we have placed an order with a lab in the USA. 

_________________________
________________________

His response went on to mention a few things that are unrelated to the subject at hand.  I will post that information in a comment below for anyone that is interested.  

To me this suggests that, no, Phenylpiracetam should not be tan, if even the T&amp;W representative agreed and the company took it back to purify it and apologized. And since it appears that Liftmode got their supply (according to my COA) from T&amp;W, it seems to me that they did not get a well purified product.  

Let me also say, though, that outside of this event my experiences with Liftmode have been overwhelmingly positive and I have a number of other products produced by them that seem to be of excellent quality and work just as they should.  Also, it seems a safe guess that what I received is actually Phenylpiracetam, but at a much lower quality standard than the COA indicates.  This does not make me not trust Liftmode for further purchases, as, judging from what NSN went through and Liftmode's character outside of this incident, it seems likely that they were assured that the product was pure and began selling it.

This is nearly the definition of flow.

Would you agree that the most concise way to describe nootropics is that it aids in entering flow? Is it different with other racetams or substances? Is my experience more subjective than anything?

Soon after started answering emails I'd been putting off for weeks / months. Dry mouth all day. Usually there's this constant lethargy of ""i don't want to"" and just wasting time on reddit the entire day, instead i've just constantly been doing and doing. And all of this on 4 hours sleep. I don't care so much that it might be unpleasant/uncomfortable in the short-term. Instead of excuses there's drive. I never would've written a review like this before lol. Bought hundreds of items on Amazon, never left a review. 

The stuff is that good.

All in all very happy with their service. They're unlike any other Online Pharmacy that I've seen in that they're actually building a brand. Yeah their stuff is more expensive than other options but if I'm gonna put chemicals with yet not-understood effects on the human brain in my body, might as well pay a $10 premium.

**Morning**  
12 oz Coffee (150 - 200 mg caffeine maybe)  
CDP Choline 800 - 1000 mg  
Piracetam 1600 mg  
Noopept 30 mg sublingual  
Vegan DHA 640 mg  
Vegan EPA 260 mg  
Kre-Alkalyn Form Creatine 750 mg

**Noon and again Afternoon**  
Piracetam 1600 mg  
Noopept 30 mg sublingual
Green tea 2 or 3 bags worth  

This was working for me rather well, I respond to Piracetam not as strongly as some reports but I definitely receive memory enhancement and general cognitive benefit (as shown by Dual-N-Back performance and my slow but steady learning of Spanish).

A peculiar effect of Piracetam, the latest addition to my stack, is the recognition of beauty in the way that sunlight plays on my small town neighborhood.  I've noticed a lot of people who react well to the racetams say exactly what I am about to say:  The trees look stunningly beautiful, it is like I can see every leaf moving independently and it seems meaningful.

Today I added 800 mg of Aniracetam and that really set things in the right direction.  Colors became dramatically brighter, the trees seemed more dramatically vibrant, things began to breathe like on psychedelic drugs.  Really the whole thing was very psychedelic except for the fact that I was physically very comfortable and the visual effects didn't border on hallucinogenic.  Also, I was not overcome with laughter or a strong ""trip"" mind, but, instead, a smooth and creative one (the creativity similar to but altogether unlike a trip).

What I'm now considering is the line between psychedelics and nootropics.  Obviously, a nootropic should not cause damage if used ""correctly"" over a long period of time, and that's at the very least.  Optimally nootropics promote long term mental health.  The term psychedelic in no way guaruntees that, but the etymoligies are tantalizingly similar.  Nootropic:  nous (mind) trepein (to bend, or towards).  Psychedelic:  psyche (mind) delos (manifest).

If a psychedelic experience is one that means the realization of powers of the mind previously unknown, or the liberation of the mind from its previously accepted borders, then isn't a nootropic experience merely a psychedelic experience that also does no damage at the very least and usually provides some sort of long term mental health benefit?

One of the things I always really enjoyed about erowid was the experience reports section for different compounds. I've added a section to all Nootropics pages for anecdotal/experience reports on SN.

Anything I should do in the next week or so?,NEWTOMODA,45,5,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/16r4ji/first_time_nootropic_user_modafinil_and/,"I recently ordered the combo package of Modafinil and Armodafinil from MyModafinil.net. I'm a first time nootropic user outside of caffeine, and wondering if there is anything *you* think I can do to better prepare myself.

Healthy, fit, mid-20s male. No prescribed medication. No drinking, smoking. I take Creatine for fitness, and Yohimbine for the occasional appetite suppressant.

I'm mainly looking to get two things out of nootropics, and I'm hoping modafinil can help me do it: Motivation, and wakefulness.

You see where I said nothing *besides* caffeine? Yeah, I have a love hate relationship with it. Luckily, I'm not addicited to it severely. I've cycled myself on / off of caffeine many times, and have no problem doing it. I try to cycle it off during downtimes (weekends) and othe vacations, but it still isn't enough.

**I fucking sleep half of my life away**. And it is annoying as fuck. I want to fix it. An example? Lets say I'm entirely cycled off of caffeine, have not touched it in a week. I'll start off my week sleeping 10, 11 hours without issue. If I wake up sooner, with 7 or 8 hours, I get sleepy very soon, within 10-12 hours. I take caffeine to combat it, but as we all know, it doesn't work too well. It fucks with my sleep schedule, and I have to start taking more and more. Week or two down the line I'm taking 400 - 600 mg of caffeine to maintain 12 - 14 hours of wakefullness each day.

I've tracked my sleep habbits, **I sleep on average 11 hours a day**.

I also noted motivation, I've heard many great things about Modafinil for this, and hopefully it will allow me to make the best use of my time while awake.

So, with that out in the open, anyone have advice on how I can make the most of my incoming modafinil? I plan to start off with 1/8th(25mg) of a dose, work my way to 1/4(50mg) the next day, and 1/2(100mg) the next, assuming no complications. I plan to have myself cycled off of caffeine before it arrives, as to not interact with it.

Thoughts and advice? Thanks! 

Edit: Which one should I start off with?

1350927103.0,37,self.Nootropics,11wkqy,"This reddit really needs some help, here's some basic stack advice that works - ",dfvHIA,89,52,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/11wkqy/this_reddit_really_needs_some_help_heres_some/,"The quality of this subreddit has gone down hill tremendously with absolutely terrible advice and misconceptions about IQ and supplements. I'm going to give you guys a solid outline of a stack that works, as well as give some advice about compounds that are frequently mentioned here. 

First what will greatly increase your thinking prowess are subtle changes that will make you better able to think around the clock overtime vs something like adderall where you are on a roller coaster. The come downs of these are not conducive to learning. If you don't believe modafinil has a come down then you probably haven't taken it for a long enough time. The best psychoactive drugs are the ones that have been around the longest due to a lower chance of negative sides. The duration they have been around can speak volumes about their efficacy.

1. DHA + Alpha GPC + Uridine - There is really good evidence regarding this stack working. There are so many ridiculous posts about modafinil and piracetam and very little on these 3. These should be the absolute bread and butter of any stack. The synergistic effect of these three is very conducive to forming new neurons and new memories. Obviously over time, this will make a substantial difference. Granted you're not likely to feel the effects the first time you take it, but I can guarantee you over time things will get easier. 

2. caffeine + L-theanine - Again, there is a lot of data that this stack works on healthy volunteers. I take a 100 mg caffeine pill twice a day and one 200 mg L-theanine pill with each one. This stack is able to increase your concentration for extended periods of time. You will likely see a difference the first time you take it. You can take solace in the fact that caffeine has been around for many years and likely was one of the first domesticated crops.  200 mgs of caffeine/d is a rather low dose. This will enable you to think more efficiently while it's in your system and when the effects where off you won't be inept. 

3. Nicotine - Don't smoke. Nicotine gets a terrible reputation due to smoking. That doesn't preclude the compound from being  advantageous. Like caffeine, nicotine has been around for thousands of years and was also likely one of the first plants to be domesticated due to it's psychoactive effects. I would suggest trying the lozenges. You would be surprised how far 4-6 mg/d could go. These have much less potential for addiction than cigarettes. These nicotine lozenges can be a great boon to studying when caffeine wears off. 

A word about piracetam and modafinil - 
1. Piracetam - There isn't a lot of data that this drug actually works in healthy people. It's touted as one of the best, but most of that is from subjective experiences and not scientific testing. I've tried it, it's okay. It's nowhere near as effective as Nicotine or Caffeine. 

2. Modafinil - While this drug works, it's not effective to take everyday. I knew a resident who worked on the original modafinil trials and decided to take it close to everyday for about a year. He wasn't pleased with the effects of it. The drug is simply not something that can be taken everyday. A little side note that he told me this reddit may find interesting. I have no way to evaluate the veracity of the statement so take it as you will. - Apparently he was drinking with the creator of the drug who mentioned to him that he found the drug endogenously in a cell culture and due to patent issues it was much more lucrative to just say he ""discovered it"" vs saying he found it in a culture. This is why he believed the drug works so well with comparatively fewer sides than some of the harder stims. 

3. A word about Marijuana - This drug truly was one of the first domesticated plants. The jury is still out about the long term effects of it. I am going to share something with you that I heard an attending say, and I've been telling my younger patients who smoke ever since. This drug is probably not harming you long term, however we can all agree it does decrease your motivation. When you are young you don't really have many skills to offer to the world. Your motivation to learn them is really all you have. If you sacrifice your motivation, you are really selling yourself short even if your innate ability is not effected. 

I would encourage you to think about what I've said here. What will make your IQ go up in the long term isn't going to be the same as what will give minimal gains the short term. Many of these drugs work by simply increasing motivation, which can go a very long way over time. More motivation will go much further than simply being smarter. Most people don't need adderall to open up that book they have been meaning to read, they also won't have the same motivation 12 hrs later. 

How safe compounds are to take long term is something to take into account.  Stimulants like adderall may work, but most people who get on the drug want off of it by 3-4 yrs. This is certainly not true of caffeine or nicotine. 


Cheers guys.

Always sort of understanding the material, but not really its implications. Fairly impulsive, emotional, little to no long-term planning. She came to me asking where she could get some Adderall to stay awake and focus for finals, and I suggested Modafinil instead.

The effects on her the next day were incredibly apparent. Her discussion and reasoning in study groups was substantially improved and even nuanced at times to the point she was raising issues I hadn't considered. 

Even in discussing her personal life, which usually is guided by emotional hunches, she began to show long-term planning and contemplation of future scenarios she had never done before. For instance, in discussing a possible long-distance relationship which she's been debating, she raised concerns over the possibility of getting a less than ideal position in the city her boyfriend would be working at and the extent to which her career would be compromised in the event that the relationship didn't work out, along with the feasibility of maintaining such a relationship for a few years if she was in a different city. It was a level of sophisticated reasoning I had never seen in her before.

Next day she was off of it and basically her old self. Then she took a 200 mg tab the day after and showed her intelligent side again. She did say she felt far more focused and involved in her material and liked the appetite suppressing sides.

I had never really noticed that pronounced of an effect of modafinil on myself outside of sleep deprivation. No energy slumps throughout the day, perhaps I'm a little more witty and focused but that's about it.

Has anyone else noticed substantially greater magnitudes of change from modafinil in their other friends? Perhaps the raw magnitude is roughly the same but the change is simply more discernible in casual conversation from a person who's usually expected to be spouting drivel. Thoughts?

Here is my first report:

As background, I am forty-seven years old, female, who is experimenting with different nootropic stacks in order to keep Alzheimer's at bay. My mother had early onset Alzheimer's in her early fifties and she died much too young. I refuse to follow that path. I had my genetic profile done via 23 and Me, and found that I do have an extremely high risk of developing early onset Alzheimer's. I eat a whole foods ""ancestral"" diet, and am in great shape for my age. For exercise I run, do a kettlebell routine twice a week, and am on a roller derby team. I will post my full stack in the sub here in another week or so.

Also, I respond extremely well to racetams. 

I took five mg - measured on a good scale - after my morning run. I thought about taking it prior to exercise, but since I run outside, I didn't want to risk the chance of stomach upset or worse. 

I didn't mix the powder with anything - I took it sublingually, and after a minute, drank a glass of water. About ten minutes later, I thought I felt a mood lifting, a slight widening of perspective. It is difficult to know when these things are real and when they are created by expectation and desire. I found myself smiling, almost wanting to dance around the house. I know that sounds silly!

I then ate breakfast - a bowl of goat's milk yogurt mixed with chia seeds and walnuts. This is when I realized something was definitely happening. I didn't expect this at all -  the taste of the food! I could taste multiple layers, the texture of the food felt more nuanced, detailed. Everything was just so damned delicious! I eat this combination frequently and enjoy it well enough, but have never once had the full body orgasmic-like explosion of delight that I experienced eating that yogurt. 

Next, I drank a cup of coffee and again, it was coffee from an alien world, with levels of depth I've never noticed. The normal bitterness seemed to spread into a thin layer, with new flavor and brightness poking through with each sip. 

I'm a bit stunned. Just from a taste perspective, it is almost a psychedelic type of experience, and something completely unexpected. It hasn't been long enough and I haven't done anything except sit here and marvel at breakfast, so I can't say whether I'm more cognizant. But for the taste alone, holy cow! 

More later, if there is more to report...

Has anybody who has used Modafinil for an extended period noticed actual increases in grades, or promotions in work, or improved ability as a crime fighting vigilant on the run from the law who's really just running from something inside their own head.

Ketones may improve cognitive functioning.


For those who are unfamiliar with coconut oil, it is unique because it is composed predominately of [Medium Chain Trigligerides (MCT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium-chain_triglycerides) which do not require energy for absorption, utilization, or storage. This means that MCT is generally considered a good biologically inert source of energy that the human body finds reasonably easy to metabolize. So in other words it provides a great energy boost with almost no fat storage. 


Elevation of plasma ketone body levels through an oral dose of medium chain triglycerides (MCTs) [may improve cognitive functioning](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15123336), and in my case it most certainly does.  [MCTs also produce more ketones](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5166216) per unit of energy than normal dietary fats. Incidentally, it's also what I use to dissolve aniracetam with - prior to taking.

Take note that I am NOT a representative of New Star Nootropics and am NOT affiliated with them in any way aside from being a very satisfied customer.

First off, I should mention that this is the first true nootropic purchase that I have made if only true -racetams and their derivatives are included, so I have nothing to compare it to. 

Keeping this in mind I will start my review.

**Price**

 I first noticed this site from [this] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/17oyrg/nootropic_price_comparison_site_noophound/) post after seeing that their noopept was one of the cheapest vendors in the U.S. (at between $2 and $4 depending on the amount you order) Other -racetam pricing seems pretty good as well, . I ordered 1g Noopept, 25g Piracetam (upgraded for free to 30g), and 25g of Centrophenoxine for just under $40 with free shipping. They also have monthly deals and bundles for 5-10%+ cheaper than normal pricing. (Currently there is a deal for 10g of Noopept for $34.50! Edit: This is only for this weekend, most likely feb 8th-feb 11th)

**Shipping**

I ordered all of this on Monday, February 4th. My order shipped on the 5th and I received it on the 7th. This was some of the fastest shipping I have had with any online retailer.

The packaging was discrete; came in a rather small brown box with Scotch tape covering the opening and the shipping label. On the shipping label it was shown to be shipped from ""New Star"", so again, very discrete if that is what you're looking for in a nootropic vendor.
The Noopept came in a very small glass vial along with a 12-15mg scoop (the scoop is MUCH smaller than I was expecting, but that is irrelevant :P); The Centrophenoxine and Piracetam came in black plastic jars with an oxygen absorber inside along with the powder as well as a 1.2-1.4g scoop for the Piracetam. All jars were wrapped in a foam-like packaging material and seemed very safe in the small box just from that.

**Product**

All of their powders have a COA (most, if not all, &gt;98%) on their site for the current batch, however nothing is sent along with the package. This is not too much of a disappointment seeing as how you can view them on their website, but it is always nice to take a few minutes and look at all the tests that were done when you receive the order. I suppose, however, that it is more useful to know the quality of the item you are looking to purchase before you do so.

*Noopept* ($9.79/1g, cheaper if larger amounts are purchased)

The Noopept has a strong, sort of musky odor. The taste is almost like concentrated alcohol, I don't need to explain that this is unpleasant, though it is bearable. Its look at texture I can only attribute possibly to corn starch, very manageable. From my research, it smells, tastes, and looks as it should. The effects are noticeable as well, I started taking this Noopept for two days and had a physics exam on the second day for which I was rather unprepared. I ended up acing it. I noticed that my short term memory is *vastly* improved, as I only looked over the material for ~20-30 minutes and was able to remember the majority of what I saw. Needless to say, the Noopept is high quality.

*Centrophenoxine* ($19.50/25g; again, cheaper if larger amounts are purchased)

This has a very clumpy texture and smells and tastes absolutely *horrid*. This is normal, and tolerable if any headaches arise. I suggest capping this if you wish to try it. One thing I did notice with this, the second day of taking it (today) it gave me quite the upset stomach. This seemed to dissipate over a bit less than an hour, but I did read that taking Centrophenoxine on an empty stomach could cause nausea (which is what I had done). Again, this item is of high quality.

*Piracetam* ($7.95/30g; again, same thing)

I actually have yet to try this, however I will describe its physical properties aside from solubility. It has a crystalline texture and no smell whatsoever. After taking a taste just now, I would describe it as very bitter and rather ""chemical"", almost akin to Phenibut in its bitterness. I believe these characteristics are to be attributed to good quality Piracetam.

**Overall: 10/10**

I had a very good experience with this vendor in every aspect. Even their customer service is fantastic as I had a few questions on which items they plan to add at the end of February (one of them is phenylpiracetam, aside from that he wouldn't tell me lol), my questions were answered quickly through the online chat application on their website and the person who dealt with me seemed very nice.

I would definitely give this vendor a 10/10. I only would like to see a few items a bit cheaper, but I was looking for cheap Noopept and that is what I got. Anyone looking for a quick, reliable, high-quality, and relatively inexpensive source of -racetams and Centro, I would advise you to give New Star a chance! 

Again, I am NOT affiliated with New Star at all, I am simply very pleased with their service and feel that other redditors would be as well.

But secondly, most of the questions are the same, and since there's only a few dozen nootropics, stacks are almost always going to wind up only coming out of these. The main criteria for judging stacks seems to be:

1. Dosages (proper dosages of everything)
2. Common synergistic effects (Caffeine + L-Theanine, Piracetam + Choline)
3. Negative drug interactions
4. Quick synopsis of the relative pros/cons of each element in a stack.

Anyway, what I am proposing to do is to write a web interface to ""rate my stack"", and add it to the smarternootropics.com website. Basically, the way I envision it, is people would add their chemicals and their dosages, and it would automatically check to see if dosages are in the proper ranges, if synergies are being taken advantage of, check for contraindications, and a quick pro/con for everything in the stack.

Hopefully this way, we could then refer newbies to the tool and have them check their stacks and get advice themselves, without having to clog up the [/r/nootropics](/r/nootropics) main subreddit.

1327446813.0,38,self.Nootropics,ov5u7,Update: Modafinil (Modalert) Experience,Brukhar1,41,3,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/ov5u7/update_modafinil_modalert_experience/,"Heyo again folks,

So, I posted my experience with Modafinil (Modalert brand) a month-ish ago: http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/n29av/modafinil_modalert_experience/

I figured, it's been awhile so I might as well post an update with regards to my experience.

My dosage is 200mg/day, right after waking up, which is the most effective for me.  Anything less and I didn't feel any noticeable effect, anything more and it was risking mental fatigue or a headache later on.  When I initially started, I had weaned myself off caffeine completely (I used to take 200mg of caffeine in the morning and usually had a caffeinated drink during the day).  I have since added caffeine back to my regimen, and I use it on days when I want an extra pop.  Combining 200mg of modafinil with 200mg of caffeine, in my opinion, provides the stimulant effect that many people are looking for, and complain about the lack of, with modafinil (if you're looking for a mild wired feeling, that's how I achieve it).

I monitor my blood pressure and heart rate, and have not experienced increases in either (blood pressure has actually lowered slightly for reasons given below).  If you combine with caffeine, you will get a slightly stronger stimulant effect from the caffeine such as increased heart rate, but nothing all that significant.

First, the biggest effect I have experienced on modafinil is appetite suppressant.  This, combined with modafinil's tendency to increase my daytime alertness and motivation, has resulted in significant weight loss.

In November, after Thanksgiving, just before taking Modafinil, at my heaviest I weighed in at 229.5 lbs.  I'm 6'2"", so this was at the upper range of overweight on the BMI scale.  I had been lifting regularly but had stopped for most of November, and I had cut off my cardio regimen because it was cold out and I was lazy.

As of today, which is about 2 months after beginning modafinil, I now weigh 203 lbs.  My BMI went from 29.5 to 26.1 (still classified as overweight but much lower), and my body fat % went from about 20% to 15%.  Both muscle bulk and tone have increased, I have added about 1/2 an inch to my biceps and can also see my obliques more definitively.  I still have body fat to lose on my chest and stomach though.  I've never been horribly out of shape, but this is probably the best shape overall I've been in for awhile.  I currently lift 4x a week and do cardio, 30 minutes, 170bpm heart rate or higher, 7x a week.

I attribute this to 2 things.  The first is the increased motivation to exercise and performance that either modafinil brings directly, or brings as a result of feeling more alert, or brings by simply helping me reduce weight by the second effect, or by placebo.  The second is that modafinil has an appetite suppressant effect.  While I can still eat an entire pizza if I so choose, I can feel mentally full by eating less.  However, the bigger part of the appetite suppressant effect is that I no longer snack, particularly at night.  I used to eat crackers, chips, or some other snack food at night.  With modafinil, I no longer have any desire to do that.

Modafinil also helps with appetite in another, unrelated way.  Modafinil, for me, causes dry mouth.  As such, my water consumption has increased from maybe 1 bottle a day, to about 5 bottles a day.  I think this lends itself to a feeling of fullness as well.

The great thing about the weight loss that I've achieved with modafinil, is that the weight is a majority of fat.  Previously, I have been able to lose weight without too much issue (diet and exercise always work wonders), but I lose strength gains and muscle bulk.  Thus far, while losing weight with modafinil, I have actually increased the resistance for my exercises.  However, this may be the result of modafinil providing a performance boost as opposed to helping me retain a higher % of muscle.  But with the muscle definition and bulk gains that I have, I am inclined to think modafinil's appetite suppressant effects are helping me maintain a better diet and thus retain more muscle while still dropping weight.

Next up, concentration, memory and academic performance.  To be entirely honest, I don't think modafinil does much for this.  I notice that I can sort of, zone out, and complete tedious work more easily than before.  But, I think modafinil actually makes it harder for me to concentrate on challenging academic material (I am preparing to study artificial intelligence at graduate school, so the reading that I'm doing beforehand is pretty intense).

Memory, I don't personally notice any difference, but then again, I am not benchmarking myself using dual-n-back or anything of the sort (yes, yes, gwern, you can kill me now :P ).  So, if modafinil is providing a memory boost, then it's certainly subtle.  I had a pretty high performing memory before taking modafinil anyways, however, and I've read that modafinil's nootropic effects (as if they can even be called nootropic in nature) are limited to lower performing individuals.

Okay, now let's talk sleep.  Modafinil keeps you awake, that's the single strongest effect from it, unquestionably.  If you're well rested, you probably don't notice it, but if you take 200mg and then try to sleep or take a nap, good luck.  If you mistime a dose, you can easily have problems falling asleep that night (ie, if you forget to take it when you wake up but take it 2-3 hours later, you will stay awake a bit longer).  I've found that the modafinil active effect duration is about 14-16 hours, so if you are looking for 7-9 hours of sleep, there is very little room for mistiming a dose.

It's somewhat strange, because it seems like I have dark circles more with modafinil, I wake up more refreshed when taking modafinil than when not using it.  My only guess is that modafinil delays REM and other aspects of the circadian rhythm, and somehow that works out in my favor so that I wake up at a better time for my personal rhythm.

I occasionally take 1-4 days off modafinil to reset my body, however.  I find that on the first day off modafinil, I sleep for a bit longer than normal.  I would guess that it's due to the body readjusting and compensating for any sleep debt accumulated during modafinil usage.  

I have now gone through 3 phases of days off (2 days, 3 days and 7 days each).  I find there are no withdrawal effects (aside from longer sleep the first day off), and it is a simple matter to stop taking it.  I don't find myself craving it when I stop taking it, unlike caffeine, where if I go from 200-300mg of caffeine to zero overnight, I have to fight the urge to drink something caffeinated the next day.

Now, for personality or psychological changes.  Modafinil doesn't change your personality, but it does, in my opinion, exacerbate certain tendencies.  For example, I have always had nervous habits such as sewing machine leg, cracking knuckles, biting my lip, chewing my nails.  But on modafinil, I actually was chewing my lip so much that I created a sore on my lip, and people have commented on the restlessness of my leg which apparently annoys them.  Also, I have always exhibited traits of perfectionism, but modafinil increases this, and I often find myself poring over text I've written or things I've created and being constantly unsatisfied with them.  Also, modafinil does make me chattier and more argumentative (not in an angry way, but simply, I debate people constantly over semantics).

I think that pretty much sums up the effects that I have experienced.  Any questions, as always, are welcome, and I hope my experience helps enlighten the nootropic community.",,False,,t5_2r81c,False,,,True,t3_ov5u7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/ov5u7/update_modafinil_modalert_experience/,

Thanks.

Hi, I just received an order from Modup.net (.net/.com are different companies, be aware of that.) and figured it would be nice to share my experience, with pictures!

Also, I'd like to note: I am in not way affiliated with modup.net - I am posting this on my main 4+ year reddit account, so obviously it isn't a shill account or something like that. So yes, outside of being a customer I have never done anything with modup.net.

Ok, so now that that's out of the way, let's get started.
In this review, I'd like to go over the ordering process and how things arrived to me. I haven't taken the medicine yet, as it's the weekend and I go out of my way not to be super focused and alert in my free time. I may do an additional review after taking the medicine for a few days, I haven't decided yet. It would mainly be subject to interest, so if that's something you'd like to see, then let me know.

I ordered from modup.net on June 10th via paypal.
On June 11th, I got an email with an order/payment confirmation.
Then on June 13th, I got an email with a tracking number. - I should note, the company that does the shipping is ""EMS Speed Post"" - I had never done any business with them, and didn't know what to expect. It should also be noted that I selected the ""Rush 7 day, £17.99"" shipping option.

I can't speak for their customer service. Apparently one of the people with the company is on reddit, which I personally think is really cool of them to do. So I guess not needing to contact them is a big plus. =)

My order arrived today on June 22, which based on the date they sent the tracking number could indeed be considered a rush 7 day shipping. So they're certainly honest about their shipment times.

Ok, so now to the good stuff... The Pictures! 

Here's the front of the packaging they sent to me:
http://i.imgur.com/PGLtGWV.png
If you can't see the picture: It's a brown bubble mailer with the name of the pharmacy and address in india stamped in blue ink on the packaging.

Here's the back of the packaging with the customs declaration:
http://i.imgur.com/9ITgqrX.png
If you can't see the picture: It's a standard customs form, it should be noted that the contents are listed as ""medicines"" on the attached form, so they are honest with dealing with customs. On the other hand, if you need discreet packaging, this isn't the most of course, but the fact they are legal in regards to customs outweighs any privacy concerns (for me anyway)

Alright, on to the really really good stuff, the actual product. Here's the front of the medicine:
http://i.imgur.com/cNDbfFj.png
If you can't see the picture: It's normal blister packages of Modvigil, a marketing name for Modafinil. Produced by HAB Pharmaceuticals, Mumbai India. I can say from the packaging that it's obviously from a major  manufacturer, it certainly isn't fake, at least from what I can see of the packaging. As for the quality, that's for another review. I've heard mixed reviews of medicines from India, so I'm very interested in finding out more.

Lastly, here's a picture of the back of one of the medicine packages:
http://i.imgur.com/tt8dzHK.jpg
If you can't see the picture: It's just the back of the medicine package, showing a 5 x 2 row blister pack of the standard variety such medicine is commonly seen in.

The Final Verdict:
Shipping and Handling: Honest Estimates, Reasonable ship time, if a little pricy.

Packaging: Well Packaged, Honest with Customs.

Medicine: Is clearly not counterfeit, has legitimate packaging, but I have not formally tried it yet, as it's the weekend.

Customer Service: Didn't need to contact them (double plus good)

Final Verdict: Definitely not a scam, I'm not telling you to order from them, but I did have a very good experience with Modup.net, so take from my experience what you will.

Lastly, I'd like to say: To those of us who are attempting to better themselves through Nootropics or other means, I sincerely hope you find what you are looking for, and it makes you happy.

I honestly believed that these were wonder drugs that would help me finish my homework and would keep me awake, aware, alert, enthusiastic. What I didn't realize was that I was depending on something outside of me to change me. 

What I can say is that nootropics  have helped my cognition in subtle ways I couldn't have expected. The best way I can put it is that they are like putting on a good pair of running shoes, or a comfortable pair of pants. I wouldn't rely on them solely to make a significant change in my life. They are factors, allies (to use Carlos Castaneda's word). but in the end, if you want to improve the quality of your life, it's YOU who has to do it. I highly recommend making a holistic commitment that includes physical, emotional, and spiritual changes. From personal experience, I recommend exercise, healthy dieting, emotional awareness, meditation, and yoga, to name a few. Nootropics can certainly be a part of that regimen. 

I wanted to include my experience to enlighten potential users of nootropics.

Caffeine in the form of 5 Hour Energy or Monster (no, not the whole thing at once - I take sips throughout the day).

It's like a less intense, longer-lasting version of Adderall - with little to no side effects over a long period of time (look up the studies). Intense focus, limitless energy. The ephedrine lasts for 5 hours and I have tried as much as twice a day so far. I've taken it for 4 days and its effects haven't waned.

It is also AMAZING for social situations. It gives increased focus, confidence, and enthusiasm without the jitters of too much caffeine.

Feel free to ask me questions if you have them.

EDIT 1: So yeah, careful with too much caffeine as you may get chest tension, increased heart rate, or increased blood pressure. 'mononokehimee' says aspirin should help with that (the full ECA stack). Also, the Guaifenesin produces phlegm in my throat and sometimes lungs. It's manageable, though.

EDIT 2: From Mod: Ephedrine is NOT a neutropic. It has tolerance and side effects. Read this about the safety profile (it cites a lot of studies): http://www.mindandmuscle.net/articles/ephedrine-cardiotoxicity-in-healthy-adults-where-is-the-proof-by-robbie-durand-m-a-c-s-c-s/

There are two kinds of ephedrine sold in the US - Ephedrine Sulfate and Ephedrine HCl. They're pretty much the same. You can buy Ephedrine HCl pure over the internet. Try the ""Kaizen"" brand, probably from a Canadian web store.

Try this stack with L-theanine and L-tyrosine for a smoother ride.

Ephedrine and Caffeine work for me because a lot of why I don't want to work isn't mental fatigue but physical fatigue. A lot of people on here focus on just increasing mental energy, so they worry about the blood-brain barrier and such a lot. But think about it: have you ever really been able to do good work when you're exhausted but your brain's still going? For me, having energy in both my mind and body is crucial, and that's why Ephedrine and Caffeine are so ephective (hehe). 


EDIT 3: Fun fact, Ephedrine and Methamphetamine's chemical structures only differ by one functional group (which is just one atom: OH to H). It's the difference between a polar and non-polar group, hence their difference in blood-brain-barrier-crossing-ability and overall effects, but it's still just one group. Weird.

For once in his life he is happy and well adjusted.  However, we are still left with the learning issues.  He reads very well, but his fine motor skills are lacking so his handwriting is awful.  Math is nearly impossible.  His drawing looks the same as it has for at least the past 6 years.  He has tested at a very low IQ, but I think that's very inaccurate because his issue is that his attention span sucks horribly.  I've tried ADHD meds and they just make him crazy and unstable.

I know there have been several posts on Reddit as of late speaking about Elevated Labs, our slow shipping times, etc.

I just wanted to communicate here with the community to clear up a few things, answer any questions you guys may have, and provide some insight into the direction we are headed.

To begin with, our shipping/fulfillment times thusfar have been substandard. Alright, they've been downright poor. Keep in mind that we have had issues with our manufacturer shipping on time/our initial manufacturer (from a ways back) shipping product we ordered at all. This has been compounded with the fact that Elevated has experienced exponential growth over the past three months. That being said, these are issues that any startup has to face and we have not dealt with them adequately yet. 

We just want to let the community know that we recognize these are problems we have and that behind the scenes we are working to ensure we can have 24 hour turnaround on all orders in 2013 here. 

To that end, one of is is going to be working on Elevated full time to ensure that future customer experiences will be stellar. We will also be implementing phone support in the near future here to help out here as well.

To any outstanding (unfulfilled) orders that would like a refund at this point, communicate with us and we will process that for you.

To our customers, we ask that you keep an eye on us and consider us again in the future. If we've lost your business, we would like to earn it back. We have many plans for Elevated as we head into 2013 here and beyond.

Warm regards (and Happy Holidays!),

**Resveratrol** is a similar compound that appears to have benefits across the board.  This includes life-extension, cancer prevention, cardio-protective (including heart disease and high cholesterol), antidiabetic, neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory and antiviral effects, testosterone booster, and reduction of Alzheimer's disease.  It has a similar bioavailability to curcumin so piperine supplementation is needed to increase the bioavailability to obtain beneficial results.

&gt;the antidepressant and increased locomotor activity relies on both R- and S-phenotropils, but the memory-improving activity is only characteristic of R-phenotropil.

This makes sense, since the benzene ring off the phenylethylamine structure is the same in both enantiomers. I postulate that the norepinephrine and dopamine affinities come from the benzene side of the molecule, and the NMDA modulation comes from the piracetam side with the open amine group.

~~[This is what I believe the R and S isomers look like.](http://i.imgur.com/G1Igp6F.png)~~

[Perhaps this.](http://i.imgur.com/D5czvf4.png)

[This site](http://chemmol.com/chemmol/49423077.html) says that C5 is the chiral center, so my picture should be accurate. (I am not certain my S and R labels are correct, though)

Since the stimulant/anti depressant effects are present in both isomers, but the memory enhancement is only present in the R, I think it's safe to postulate that the NE and DA effects are from the benzene side. This would also explain why the methylenedioxy ring on MDMA reduces the substances affinity for DA in comparison to methamphetamine. It also fits with 6-APB having a higher DA affinity than MDMA. The benzofuran ring has one less oxygen atom than the methylenedioxy ring, which causes the substance to have a higher DA affinity and less 5-HT affinity. The benzene is what has NE and DA affinities.

I am not a chemist, so these are just postulations at this point. Does anyone see any holes with my thinking?

I'm pretty new to the whole nootropics thing and I understand certain nootropics work best to help certain aspects of your life or mental processing and others won't do much of anything to help, so can anyone suggest something to give me an energy boost that's stronger than caffeine but not as jittery/euphoric as amphetamines and perhaps something to clear up the apathy and give me a little more focus and motivation?

Ive used piracetam and a couple choice herbal nootropics on and off last since last summer without any apparent negative effects, and haven't seen anything too worrying about the drug from a research perspective until this morning when I ran into a comment posted by someone named ""mike"" on IEETs blogpost on the substance here: 
http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/nicholas20120320

The comment reads ""I was taking Piracetam until a routine blood test showed I had higher than normal HCT (Hemocrit) and Hemoglobin levels.  HCT is a percentage of the concentration of red blood cells vs. plasma in the blood and a high level could be an indicator for Polycythemia. Turns out, Piracetam has been shown to stimulate erythropoiesis (production of red blood cells) in rats.(a)  None of the research I had done previously had shown any relationship between erythropoiesis and Piracetam, so I didn’t immediately make a connection.  The risks of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, or ESAs are many. Studies show that patients with breast or advanced cervical cancers who receive erythropoiesis-stimulating agents to treat anemia caused by chemotherapy died sooner or have more rapid tumor growth than similar patients who don’t receive the anemia drugs.  They have also been shown to have increased heart risks and could cause harm to those with kidney disease.  Bottom line?  Check with your doctor before using this as a supplement!""

(a) http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8203283

I read the research paper that the comment linked too and it validates his claim. Still wanting to believe in the safety of one of my favorite concentration tools, I decided too look into further studies.

http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/content/20/suppl_4/iv159.full

""The influence of ESAs on tumor response and overall survival in anemic cancer patients remains unclear. Several randomized trials have demonstrated decreased survival times and poorer loco-regional control or progression-free survival""

Of course these studies are done in cancer patients, but anything that seems to foster tumor growth and decrease survival odds is generally not a good thing to put in your body. Remember that we are constantly bombarded by cancers attempting to form in our body, and giving them a window of opportunity isn't ever good. Of course, further research must be done on piracetams action as an ESA in cancer patients before this hypothesis can be validated or rejected, but I personally don't think its worth it to risk well being for the sake of piracetams relatively minor cognitive aid, at least in my own personal case.

I've never consumed this much, but after reading some accounts of studies from [here](http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=foodspice&amp;dbid=8#healthbenefits I decided I would try.), I really have to say after 3 days I've noticed a pretty substantial improvement. One interesting fact is that the positive effects seem to continue even as consumption increases to 3 lbs a day. So you can continue eating large quantities and the beneficial properties continue to increase.

The only nootropic I have taken is aniracetam and I would say that the effect of the blueberries on energy and improved cognitive function is much more noticeable than that of aniracetam. Aniracetam made me kind of dreamy and lazy for 2-3 hours and then very irritable. That is not to say that there were not enjoyable properties of aniracetam as well (vivid colours come to mind), but I am comparing them for energy/wakefulness.

Some interesting facts:

-Complete body antioxidant, the various phytonutrients (nutrients that make up the dark blue colour of the berries) provide antioxidant protection for many parts of the body.

-The antioxidant protection in the brain provides functional cognitive benefits including improved memory. A study carried out on older adults with an average age of 76 years improved cognitive scores on a repeat test after 12 weeks.

I'm curious if an antioxidant can really provide this much of a change. Is my brain really undergoing so much oxidative stress that a huge intake of antioxidants really 'unlocks' this portion that is normally unavailable? 

Also, it is important to note that blueberries function as a low glycemic index food, meaning that the increased energy is not due to a sugar spike, since the sugar is absorbed at a slow rate into the bloodstream, providing even energy distribution.

There's also the possibility that I was simply not consuming enough fruits and vegetables in general, although I have not noticed this kind of change from eating melons (which I ate every day for a period of several months, eating 1 lb of blueberries for 3 days and I am already noticing at least a 30% increase in wakefulness that lasts throughout the entire day).

I started a nootropics log 7 days ago with the intent to document how they personally affected me and what someone may experience when first trying nootropics. I'll add TL;DR below to summarize my experience.


***TL;DR***

**Stack:**

* Piracetam
* Fish Oil
* ALCAR/ALA
* L-Theanine
* Caffeine 
* B12

**Effects:**

* Vivid Dreams
* Deeper Concentration
* Profound Mind-Body Connection
* Easing Conversation
* Thoughts flow
* Focused
* Creativity
* Angst/Anxiety

**Summary:**
There may be some truth in starting with an attack dose (at least with the Piracetam) as with me, personally, I ended up taking a smaller dose than what I originally started with which I believe helped. Overall I did feel and see an increase in cognition. I got an A on an exam and feel like my stack aided in my studying and ultimately in taking the exam itself. If your on the fence with Noots I would suggest to seriously consider them.

***The Log***


***January 19th, 2013/Saturday***
-
* Piracetam – 4,800 mg


I went to the gym after my second dose and I felt a greater connection to my body than usual. I had more control over my range and movement of exercise, including breathing, which was more profound. Aside from working out conversation came very easy, not having thinking too much of what to say yet it made since and I kept going, I’m usually not like this. My mood was very uplifted, excited, and unafraid. Being a Saturday I have not been able to test it’s “book functions” very much but I am excited to channel that energy into academia instead of social interactions.

-

***January 20th, 2013/Sunday***
-
* Piracetam – 4,800 mg

Today was cardio day at the gym. I was able to run for an hour, running 7.5 miles, it was the longest and farthest I had run. Burned 1500 calories, Piracetam definitely has a positive endurance/motivation effect while exercising, giving you a greater mind-body connection. Again mood was uplifted, not as elevated as yesterday, it could’ve been because either, unlike yesterday I wasn’t at a social event/function today or it was placebo.  Conversations came easier. Thoughts flowed, and felt more creative. 

-

***January 21st, 2013/Monday***
-
* Piracetam – 4,800mg
* ALCAR/ALA – 800mg/400mg
* L-Theanine – 200mg 
* Caffeine – 100mg

On day three I didn’t feel as stimulated as I had the past two days. It could’ve been placebo or my body is getting adjusted to the dose (4,800 mg). However, all the cognitive effects were still present as they had been in the past. Leg day came and went at the gym and I didn’t dread it as much as usual. Not much difference as far as cognition in the past two days. Tomorrow should be interesting as it is the first day back to class and I have an exam on Wednesday. We’ll see how much it helps.





***January 22nd, 2013/Tuesday***
-
* Piracetam – 4,000mg
* ALCAR/ALA – 1,200mg/600mg
* L-Theanine – 100mg 
* Caffeine – 100mg

Back to class and the daily grind of the usual. I decided to take slightly less Piracetam in the night because while it wasn’t keeping me awake at night it kept me rolling for a little while and kept my mind going. Bumped up the ALCAR, to help with the grogginess I had been feeling from yesterday and also lowered my L-theanine for that reason. I can still say I am getting that focused energy (I presume from the L-Theanine &amp; Caffeine) and more fluidity with my thoughts. I was able to read and take notes of two chapters in an hour, something that I had never done; while it had not become easier, I was just more motivated to do it. Overall, I feel like this stack is going well I may modify it a bit tomorrow depending on my energy levels.

-

***January 23rd, 2013/Wednesday***
-
* Piracetam – 4,000mg
* ALCAR/ALA – 1,200mg/600mg
* L-Theanine – 100mg
* Caffeine – 200mg


Exam was today, made an A; did pretty well, memory recall was there. I like this dosing better kept me going and alert through my evening/night workout. All the cognitive effects are there, yet they are subtler; not as “jumpy,” if you will, as when I first started but the effects are there. It feels just right, 4,800mg of Piracetam may have been too much so taking it down to 4,000mg allows me to channel focus more towards what I’m doing instead of trying to divide that energy into a plethora of things. Going well, we shall see how tomorrow pans out.

-

***January 24th, 2013/Thursday***
-
* Piracetam – 3,200mg
* ALCAR/ALA – 1,200mg/600mg
* L-Theanine – 100mg
* Caffeine – 200mg

Tried a lower dosage of Piracetam and again, feel better than when I took the 4,8000mg dose. I will probably try for 2,400mg tomorrow to see how that works. No fatigue and complete mental acuity throughout the day.  

***January 25th, 2013/Friday***
-
* Piracetam – 2,400mg
* ALCAR/ALA – 1200mg/600mg
* L-Theanine – 100mg
* Caffeine – 200mg

Last night I had some of the most vivid dreams I had experienced. Though I took my final dose of Piracetam &lt;1 hour before going to bed so that may have had something to do with it. I’ll probably end up doing that tonight to see what dreams come to me. Again, with a lower dose the effects are there but they are subtle like most anecdotes note and it feels right. Absolutely no anxiety or jumpiness that I was experiencing earlier in the week, so it felt like this dosing is just right and will end up sticking with this. Overall, I’m really enjoying this stack and will continue it.

It makes it very difficult to figure out how nootropics interact with each other, what stack does what, how people react to different nootropics, etc. I'm pretty sure that there's a way to make this whole process easier and more efficient, and I'd like to discuss possible solutions with you.

How cool would it be if there was a website where people could semantically input (with actual data and numbers, instead of text) their current and past custom stacks, and share their experience/results semantically (by selecting multiple perceived benefits and side effects). Not only would this make easier for people to share, keep track of and find stacks, but the data could also be used to identify patterns and correlations between different drugs/nootropics. For example, we could clearly see the correlation between intake of recitams and headaches (assuming no intake of choline), and even confirm this by seeing how headaches disappear with choline intake (for a specific individual). People could use it as a log, by inputting everything they take and noting all the benefits or side-effects, and it could even suggest quantities and/or to add X element to your stack based on them (side-effects). 

Let's say I'm new to nootropics, and I want to improve basic cognitive functions. I could input what I already take (if any), what I'm looking for in a drug, my level of experience and the level of risk I want to take, where I live (which could filter illegal drugs, if I want), etc. The system could suggest me piracetam, and lead me to different resources about it (including data from the website, indicating the average results and side-effects, how is it often combined with other nootropics, where I can purchase it (and under what trade names), etc. Once I've done additional research and decide to try piracetam, the system could suggest me to take a certain quantity (or even suggest me to take an attack dose). If I feel tired or I have headaches, I would input it and it could suggest me (based on what worked with other people) to add choline to my stack. In the case that piracetam doesn't work on me, it could suggest me alternatives that work for other people who also don't react to piracetam. Possibilities are endless, and it could even contribute to science.

Such a complete system would be fairly complex to build, but we could start by building a simple log application that let people input what they take, note their side-effects and share their custom stack with people. Then, we could build the recommendation system and additional features on top of it.

I personally have the technical requirements to build such a system, but I'm not interested in building it alone, nor making something nobody will use.

Do you guys think that such a system could work? Is it something you would use? Are forums and subreddits already sufficient?

How’s it going? Read on:

How, where &amp; how much?

Vital Stats:
200~lbs (14stone)
1.88m (6”2)

I bought my stack from Nootropic Hub (UK based site, Google it.) Buying in a powdered format as opposed to capped is far cheaper and fiscally sensible – buy in bulk. 

I take half a teaspoon of Piracetam in the morning (circa 7am) and again at lunch (around 12:30am) along with a little over half a teaspoon of Choline Bitartrate mixed in water. Two important things to note: If you do not take sufficient amounts of Choline you will get a throbbing, painful headache. Secondly, Piracetam tastes like shit, if you can I’d advise you take it with a soft drink like Dr.Pepper or Coke to disguise the taste.

What can I expect?

This is going to be purely qualitative. You will be focused, alert and attentive however this effect will be incredibly subtle. As I work with large data sets at my job I tend to switch off/procrastinate when monotony sets in; this is now a thing of the past, I feel incredibly motivated for the entire day – I once read that Piracetam has a half-life of around 4 hours therefore I tend to space my doses between these windows to experience peak benefits (and always on an empty stomach too).

Another great effect which was unexpected and which I’ve also read on a few topics here is how noticeably more sociable you become. I attribute this to a surplus of energy which naturally lends itself to you engaging with people more.

My caffeine addiction is all but gone; I regularly had 5-6 cups a day at work now I rarely have one a week.

I hope anyone who is lurking on this subreddit will now feel motivated to actually experiment with Piracetam, rather than becoming trapped in a cycle of reading scientific literature on the subject yet never taking the plunge.

So, my supply has all but run out and I need to ‘re-up’ (to use an Americanism/Wireism).  I’m thinking of adding one additional nootropic to the stack each month – any gurus in here that have any advice?

The only way now is up!

I originally started researching the chemicals when I was looking up things that may cure my stutter. I stumbled by the *racetams and read pretty much nothing but good reviews about it. I was unable to find any negative side effects minus the headaches that are caused by a deficit in choline. When I read up on the other reviews it was pretty much a no-brainer, it was a cheap investment so I ordered some starter supplies. 

I started with around 4g of piracetam per day split into 2 2g servings paired with 1.3g of choline citrate. No headaches yet and wonderful results (minus the taste). 

The benefits have been rather great, my mind is sharper, faster and more efficient. My stutter has greatly decreased although not cured. However when I do stutter I find the length of my jams to be decreased.  So I am very happy with it.

However, today I decided to skip a day. I was unsure if it was the lack of piracetam or the bad night sleep I got but it seemed like my mind was running slow, even slower than before I started taking the piracetam. This effect mostly was prevalent early morning till around 2pm when I had some subway. Is this normal and common?

I ordered some L-Lysine HCL and Vinpocetine to further supplement me further, I however won't start taking these till next year when I start school again.

&gt;Some preliminary results of studies on high-dose inositol supplements show promising results for people suffering from problems such as bulimia, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), agoraphobia, and unipolar and bipolar depression.[20][21]

&gt;In a single double-blind study on 13 patients, myo-inositol (18 grams daily) has been found to reduce the symptoms of OCD significantly, with effectiveness equal to SSRIs and virtually without side-effects.[22] In a double-blind, controlled trial, myo-inositol (18 grams daily) was superior to fluvoxamine for decreasing the number of panic attacks and other side-effects.[20]

&gt;A double-blind, placebo-controlled study of depressed patients showed that a high dose of inositol (12 grams daily) resulted in significant improvement of symptoms, with no changes noted in liver, kidney, or hematological function.[21] A meta-analysis of randomized trials of inositol for depression was not able to determine if inositol is of benefit.[23]

&gt;Older research suggests that lithium functions primarily by decreasing myo-inositol concentrations in bipolar patients; however the conclusions of this research are unsupported and have been questioned.[24][25] Other studies suggest that lithium treatment may further inhibit the enzyme inositol monophosphatase, leading to higher intracellular levels of inositol triphosphate,[26] an effect that was enhanced further by administration of an inositol triphosphate reuptake inhibitor.

Secondly, I am interested in reversal of negative effects because I am quitting tonight and would like to know my options. Thanks!

From his post:
&gt;It is a fact that amphetamine is a powerful stimulant, though. This will increase the firing of glutamatergic receptors. Glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter. An overabundance of glutamate firing can lead to cell death, which is the last thing you want. L-Theanine mildly blocks NMDA and kainate receptors, which give it mildly neuroprotective effects - it's preventing (or at the least lessening) the negative effects of overexcitation. It also boosts GABA production; GABA is inhibitory, essentially glutamate's opposite (though it functions much differently, this comparison works for a simple explanation).
The type of stress your cells are under is often referred to as ""oxidative stress"", wherein molecules called free radicals increase drastically in number due to processes being sped up by amphetamine. Antioxidants bind to free radicals and inactivate them. Grape Seed Extract is a great antioxidant. A group of Vitamin E molecules, called tocotrienols, also exhibit antioxidant effect. I would definitely supplement those two alongside amphetamines. As for the L-Theanine, there are likely better neuroprotectants than that that I can't think of at the moment. Anyone reading, feel free to share any examples of good protectants!

Something hit me today - SSRIs block the reuptake of serotonin all around the body (that's part of why they tend to increase appetite/lead to weight gain). Blocking reuptake = more serotonin able to bind to receptors = increased serotonin agonism, including on the heart. With the potency and daily use needed for SSRIs, shouldn't we be seeing people who have used such medications for years developing cardiac fibrosis?

I always had problems motivating myself and focusing. I get easily distracted/bored. And I am a world-class day dreamer. I like to imagine scenarios in my head and live them. Those scenarios always involve me having some form of success.

The first part (lack of will) is, I believe, is a downside of being smart. I grew up having it too easy and didn’t start feeling challenged until university (in scientific disciplines, my results were always above 90%). So I never learned good work habits and discipline because I didn’t have to.

The second part (distracted, day-dreamer) is just a flaw of my personality. I like imaging the results of my work rather than do the work. For example, while reading a book on computer graphics, I would imagine myself writing a 3d renderer from scratch, publishing it and imagining how people will love it. I guess it motivates me at first but it always end up a major waste of time. Most of the time, I’ll drop the project and switch to something else that will give me the same early excitement again.

I guess the fact that I started researching drugs highlights my tendency to go after the easy path rather than work hard.

Anyways, I found out about Modafinil and got some. I had a very good response to it. At 200mg, it was too much, I just felt too wired and it gave me headaches. 50 – 100 mg felt a lot better.
At the end of the day, I didn’t feel more motivated (to study, learn, read books). And while doing a task, I still would get distracted.
The only positives were that I am more awake.

I also ordered pramiracetam to see if it could help. I haven’t tried it yet.

So here I am.
I would love to hear about your opinion about this.
I may have some form of light ADD, but I am starting to think that I should work on my motivation/perseverance deficit oh the psychological front rather than on the brain-chemistry front.

About a year and a half ago, I kicked a 6 year Adderall habit of about 90mg (30mg x 3) a day. 

Since that time, life has been one hell of a struggle. Most days I feel that I have no energy whatsoever. Finding focus and motivation to work is very difficult, and my once limitless creativity is now all but gone. Needless to say, this has left me very depressed and filled with anxiety, as I feel stuck and useless.

I often wonder if Adderall severely screwed up my brain's ability to process dopamine and norepinephrine ... It certainly feels like it.

I suspect some of you here may be in the same boat, and I would really appreciate any advice you may have. Will I ever feel the same again? Is there any regimen of nootropics / vitamins / medicine that could help repair the damage the adderall has done?

I live in the US and this was the only site I could really find confirmation on being legit and delivering real products to the US.

Nubrain sent me an email eventually after they got the order in, it seems to go out of stock every other week, and told me my order had shipped. Two weeks later and no package. Nubrain's Order FAQ says to wait 10 days before contacting them about a missing delivery, so I did this. Their response was that even though someone told me my order had shipped, the order was not actually shipped, they were sorry, and they'd mail it that day.

About 4 days after they *actually* shipped my order I received the tiny hand wrapped package containing my Modapro.

**My expectations:**  I expected this drug to give me results similar to Adderall where I felt a mental cloud lifted, everything became more interesting, and it was easier to study or work on otherwise boring tasks (If I didn't get distracted by anything).

**Actual Experience:**
On the first day I took a single 200mg tablet. After about an hour I started to feel the anxiousness I've associated with energy drinks, but without a pleasant Caffeine high I usually feel with the 5 Hour Energy drinks I'll otherwise take when tired. After the *jitters* wore off I simply felt awake. Pharmaceuticals may affect different people differently but all Modafinil did for me was remove any feeling of needing sleep or rest for about 12 hours. Modafinil did not create any sort of pleasant feeling or buzz or any noticeable interest in tasks or increase in concentration.

Literally all Modafinil did for me was erase grogginess while it was active.
I had read many different experience reports on sites like erowid.com and here which explained Modafinil effects similar to those of Adderall or Ritalin. It did not have any of these affects on me. My mental ""Fog"" was not removed like I've felt on Adderall and nothing became more interesting. I wasn't more creative or productive.

The next day I took a smaller does of half a tablet, 100mg, to see if reports of lower doses having greater affects was true with me. It was not. 100mg just gave me about the same effects as 200mg but more subtly. 

On the third day I upped my dosage to 1 and 1/2 tablets (300mg). This was the first time I took it on an empty stomach, having previously read comments suggesting it didn't matter if taken with or without food. At 300mg I felt uncomfortably anxious. I just couldn't really relax on 300mg and ultimately decided it was not a pleasant experience, though not terribly bad.. just not worth it. At 300mg no additional affects were felt beyond a more intense wakeful sensation. I didn't feel like I had more energy at all, I didn't feel like I could run further or lift more like I may feel with some energy drinks or adrenalin, I just felt uncomfortably anxious.

Later during the evening of the third night, after taking 300mg on an empty stomach, at about 9pm I started feeling stomach pains and by midnight was in extreme pain. Though obviously not scientifically proven, I am pretty confident taking the Modapro on an empty stomach gave me a severe ulcer. I was rolling in pain until about 6am. The only reason I didn't go to the emergency room was because here they're a very long wait and usually very expensive. I decided to try and wait out the ulcer and continue sipping milk. The pain eventually went away but I'm still being careful with what I eat/drink two days later. ***I would highly recommend NOT taking Modapro on an empty stomach*** to avoid the chance you'll have the same pain I had.

I skipped Modafinil the day after the pain and took it once again this morning, just the normal 200mg dose. Again today it just makes me feel a little anxious, hard to gauge grogginess as I got a full nights sleep, but otherwise has no positive effects.

**In conclusion**, Modafinil did not live up to the reviews and expectations I've read here an elsewhere. The reviews made it sound more like the ADD drugs I've taken in the past, except *better*, but the experience was extremely disappointing. I would only recommend Modafinil as a way to stay awake for extended periods of time, like perhaps 12 hours after you're already tired, or to keep taking it every 12 hours to stay awake for two days straight. I don't expect to order any more of this as it did not make studying or any other activity more interesting or easier to do. I'll only use the remaining tablets for long drives most likely.

I've read previously Modafinil was the closest drug out there to the NZT pill from the new movie Limitless, and from my experience this is extremely inaccurate. I knew it wouldn't be close to the same, but this was further from that movie's pill than many other chemicals and pharmaceuticals out there. A 5 hour energy would probably help more in the short term than Modafinil.

Again though, different people may have legitimately different reactions to the drug but I'm really leaning towards this being extremely over-hyped, unless of course I received a fake product.

In pursuit of a GABA(A) alpha5-subtype-selective inverse agonist to enhance cognition, a series of 6,7-dihydro-2-benzothiophen-4(5H)-ones has been identified as a novel class of GABA(A) receptor ligands. These thiophenes have higher binding affinity for the GABA(A) alpha5 receptor subtype compared to the GABA(A) alpha1, alpha2, and alpha3 subtypes, and several analogues exhibit high GABA(A) alpha5 receptor inverse agonism. 6,6-Dimethyl-3-(2-hydroxyethyl)thio-1-(thiazol-2-yl)-6,7-dihydro-2-benzothiophen-4(5H)-one (43) has been identified as a full inverse agonist at the GABA(A) alpha5 receptor and is functionally selective over the other major GABA(A) receptor subtypes. 43 readily penetrates into the CNS to give selective occupancy of GABA(A) alpha5 receptors. In addition, 43 enhances cognitive performance in rats in the delayed 'matching-to-place' Morris water maze test-a hippocampal-dependent memory task-without the convulsant or proconvulsant activity associated with nonselective, GABA(A) receptor inverse agonists.",,False,,t5_2r81c,False,,,True,t3_1hiu17,http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/1hiu17/xpost_from_drugnerds_α5ia_gabaa_inverse_agonist/,

1361795145.0,28,self.Nootropics,196t61,Unusual reaction to myModafinil.net Waklert/Armodafinil,waklerthrowaway,34,6,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/196t61/unusual_reaction_to_mymodafinilnet/,"In the past year, I've been self-medicating a neurological fatigue disorder with modafinil supplied from myModafinil. It's been amazing. My concentration, interests, and physical abilities have returned to roughly where they were before the disorder. It's help turn my life back around after persistent mental fog risked ruining my career. 

Two weeks ago, I placed an order on myModafinil for half modafinil, half armodafinil. The package arrived without a hitch. My understanding is that armodafinil is just the active enantiomer within modafinil, so it should be more potent but produce the same effects. 

I took an armodafinil this morning and felt no real difference at first. My girlfriend and I walked a few miles around town, got coffee and lunch, but she noticed the entire time I was jabbering on nonstop. I'm not the most quiet guy usually, but even on equivalent/adjusted doses of modafinil, I never kept talking like I did on armodafinil. My mental reaction was nothing like modafinil, and I had way too much nervous energy at all times.

When I got home, I exercised a bit and took a shower. About 5 minutes into the shower, I looked down to see that my knees had turned a dark, dark purple that was close to black. Think of the shade of a really bad bruise, or the first stages of frostbite, or a ripe eggplant. This color spread quickly up my thighs, and remained there, slowly dissipating into lighter purples and blues over the next 12 hours. As of now, it's basically gone. 

Has anyone had a similar experience? My research shows that purple knees are a common side effect of amphetamines and mephedrone, but I can find no similar reaction to modafinil noted anywhere. I've never had a reaction like this before, and if the active chemicals between Modalert and Waklert are the same, I don't see why I should. Is it possible that my waklert was actually just amphetamines, or at least tainted by amphetamines? I'm going to buy a dancesafe kit for detecting amphetamines, but fair warning to anyone who has recently bought Waklert. 

tl;dr: Took armodafinil, had a speedy reaction complete with a sudden purpling of my knees.

It is incredibly inexpensive (especially compared to other substances). It is widely available and you don't need a prescription. It is safe to use and you have to be absolutely insane to OD on it. 


It has been shown: 

* to significantly decrease cancer risks
* beat vaccines at fighting the flu
* improve balance, muscle twitch speeds, reaction speeds
* enhance cognition and mood
* and on and on and on.... the benefits are innumerable.


And while your body can automagically make its own supply for the vast majority of people the conditions for that just aren't available because of where they live, their lifestyle and other factors.


What is this marvelous substance? 


    Vitamin D


Well, actually it isn't really a 'vitamin' per se. It is actually a [secosteroidal hormone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D) vital to myriad of functions in your body.


Please, please, please do not overlook the most fundamental thing you can do to improve your health !!


Go and get your 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 serum levels checked and cajole your loved ones to do the same.


Then based on the results, take the [necessary amounts](http://i.imgur.com/5iDir.png) to get up to 125-200 nmol/L.


The recommended intake is 600 IU but that is laughably out of date. Vitamin D approaches toxicity at levels of 40,000 IU per day for several months. Most people need to take anywhere between 3000-8000 depending on how much sun they get, the color of their skin, their starting serum levels, etc.


Thank you and again, sorry if this sounds preachy but I just couldn't help myself. If this helps just one person it's worth it.


Back to our regularly scheduled program...



EDIT: 


Since some are concerned about toxicity:



&gt; **Published reports suggest toxicity may occur with 25(OH)D concentrations beyond 500 nmol/L (200 microg/L)**

[source](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16549491)


and...


&gt; Except in those with conditions causing hypersensitivity, there is **no evidence of adverse effects with serum 25(OH)D concentrations &lt;140 nmol/L, which require a total vitamin D supply of 250 microg (10,000 IU)/d to attain. Published cases of vitamin D toxicity with hypercalcemia, for which the 25(OH)D concentration and vitamin D dose are known, all involve intake of &gt; or = 1000 microg (40,000 IU)/d.** Because vitamin D is potentially toxic, intake of &gt;25 microg (1,000 IU)/d has been avoided even though the weight of evidence shows that the currently accepted, no observed adverse effect limit of 50 microg (2,000 IU)/d is too low by at least 5-fold.

[source](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10232622)


&gt; **A clinical trial carried out during the autumn/winter season in 46 institutionalized elderly subjects (35 women, 11 men) (group mean age = 83 +/- 2 years) revealed a severe deficiency in vitamin D in these subjects (25-hydroxyvitamin D level less than or equal to 3 ng/ml). After oral administration of 100,000 IU of vitamin D3, an increase in 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels above the 10 ng/ml threshold was observed and maintained for three months. A second dose, administered after 3 months, made it possible to sustain this level. No sign of toxicity was detected, notably no trace of hypercalcemia.**

[source](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1963239)


&gt; The serum level of 25(OH) vitamin D was clearly elevated at 150 ng/mL (reference range from 30 to 60 ng/mL), but **in most published cases of vitamin D toxicity, serum levels have been well above 200 ng/mL.**


[source](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22189812)



**200 ng/ml is equivalent to 500 nmol/L !!** As you can see from the above references you need to go somewhere beyond 200 nmol/L to approach toxicity and the cases of such are rare. On another note, please check out http://www.grassrootshealth.net/ they work with the leading scientists in the field (see list on the left side panel) and are also conducting a public trial of vitamin D supplementation.

For my ADHD I take Wellbutrin (XL, 300mg), which, along with being a non-selective catecholamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI) is a non-competitive nicotinic ACh receptor antagonist. I don't like the idea of blocking Acetylcholine at *any* receptor (on a daily basis especially) - since being on the Wellbutrin I've noticed a stark decrease in verbal memory and problem-solving recall (experiencing the ""tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon"" much more often and having difficulty remembering how to do non-recent math problems with ease).

I'm almost certain this is from Wellbutrin's anticholinergic properties.
(I also take Strattera, which is a highly-selective (prefrontal cortex) norepinephrine reuptake inihibitor and NMDA antagonist) ...

**I would *love* nothing more than to counteract this** - I miss the witty alliterations I could so easily come up with before, the synonyms, the deeper thinking. I'm missing out.

I'm on both of these drugs for the improvement of ADHD symptoms, which they have certainly done quite well. I chose to go this route rather than the methylphenidate/amphetamine route because of relative safety and the fact that these aren't controlled substances (nobody's gonna try to buy my Strattera... it's certainly not Adderall! Plus it's no hassle to pick up my prescriptions this way, and my doctor's comfortable too.)

*Anyway*, from perusing Wikipedia's page on anticholinergics and a longecity thread or two, I've found the (to my knowledge) **rumor that Piracetam and other racetams can counteract these effects.**

I've been **unable to find evidence for this, does anyone know if it's true?** I'm certainly comfortable adding Aniracetam to my cocktail if it means no (or at least *lessened*) anticholinergic effects.

1366499717.0,28,self.Nootropics,1crp12,Not-so positive experiences with Racetams and Noopept so far--seeking advice,nooilovethetropics,38,10,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/1crp12/notso_positive_experiences_with_racetams_and/,"A few weeks ago I received a sample pack from New Star with piracetam, pramiracetam, and noopept.  I haven't given any of them an extended period of time to kick in, but as I explain below, I think the side effects from each too detrimental for me to give that a shot.

Couples things to note. First, I've read on these forums that people are either responders, non-responders, or meh-responders. I think I'm a responder. Even in the smallest doses, I ""feel"" each of these chemicals. And I think that's the problem.  Second, I'm an attorney, and my job requires me to be sharp and focused every day.  Third, I'm 30, male, with no mental deficiencies (that I'm aware of, although I often have trouble maintaining focus) and I exercise often. Fourth, I sometimes have trouble finding the right word when writing or speaking. I don’t like pausing to find it, and often a synonym doesn’t fit correctly. My goal is to fix that.

Piracetam: I first took a ""scoop,"" ~1.2g, of piracetam mixed into water on a weekend with no Choline source. About 15 minutes later, I felt a slight stimulant-like buzz, and I noticed that I had some light sensitivity, which is hard to describe, but it’s almost like seeing spots/tunnel vision. I then started up some Call of Duty and proceeded to easily unlock a half-dozen achievements that I'd been struggling with for weeks. I felt like I was making better, faster subconscious decisions, and my reaction times were faster than before.  A good start.

When I tried it at work, however, I found that the light sensitivity/tunnel vision and high-like feeling were incredibly distracting. For example, I had a meeting with a client and found myself wondering if I was having trouble focusing my eyes (I have great vision usually) and whether I felt or sounded ""high."" The same things also happened when I tried to write, which made it difficult to do so.
 
I also noticed increased irritability. I'm not a patient person to begin with, but I found myself getting seriously frustrated with slow moving people and things. I was immediately aware of the irritability though, so I don't think I showed it outwardly. In any case, I don’t like that feeling. 

I had these same experiences with and without Choline. My Choline source is 500mg capsules of Choline Bitartate (235 mg per tablet of Choline). 

Noopept:  Started with 3 smaller 10mg scoops (~30mg) orally.  I quickly felt that too, which was cleaner and less intense than Piracetam. I also tried 10mg sublingually. The effects were about the same.  I liked the feeling of Noopept more than pi or pramiracetam, but I also felt a little bit of brain fog.  I didn't think that mattered much and I was happy to continue taking it, but then I experienced a scary bout of short term memory loss.

Basically, I had a discussion with one of my bosses about two assignments.  When we finished hashing out the details of the second one, I got up to leave, and then realized I had no idea what I was supposed to do on the first one. I knew some of what we talked about, as if the memory was there somewhere, I just couldn't recall what my role was.  Luckily I was able to get the details from him without betraying my ignorance too badly. This has never happened to me before, and, frankly, I can’t let it happen again.

Pramiracetam: My dosing with this leaves a lot to be desired.  The FAQ suggested 300mg twice a day as a starting point.  Because New Star gave me only two spoons, one which is ~1.2g worth of piracetam, and one that is roughly 10-12 mg of noopept, I had to improvise. Pramiracetam is crystally and less dense seeming that noopept, so I figured that a scoop would be less than 10-12mg each.  I still didn’t want to over do it, so I put 6 scoops from the small spoon, figuring that would be less than 75mg tops, and definitely less than 100mg.   I first used it in water, and then at other times dissolved into a mix of 2% milk and half and half.  

Even this small amount of pramiracetam hit me pretty hard.  I felt buzzed again, and saw spots/had tunnel vision again.  The buzzing was a big downer, I often felt I had to shake my head quickly to sort of get back into things.  The plus is that I felt that I spoke more fluidity and with more confidence.  This is what I was looking for initially, so I was pleased with those results. I just can’t seem to find a dose that won’t get me distractingly buzzed.  I’ve even tried with as few as 4 scoops (probably less than 50mg), and it hasn’t helped.

So, basically I’m hoping that I can find something that will help me speak and write more fluidly.  Other posts have suggested that ani or oxyracetam might be a better fit.  Does any one have any thoughts on that?

Tl;dr version:
Will ani or oxyracetam help with verbal fluidity without the minuses listed below?

My experiences so far:
Piracetam: +quicker reactions and decision making, good for video games. –irritability, tunnel vision/light sensitivity/seeing spots, high feeling
Noopept: +lesser, cleaner high feeling than racetams. -no immediate benefits, short term memory loss, brain fog.
Pramiracetam: +verbal fluidity, small doses work as well as larger ones. –high feeling affects brain clarity, very distracting tunnel vision/light sensitivity/seeing spots.

These things affect everyone differently, so your experiences may be very different from mine.

Before I dive into the supplements, I'd like to point out some areas I think may be more important. 

Certain lifestyles and experiences are detrimental to brain health. Before you find a combination of nootropics you would like to try, perhaps spend time thinking of ways you might be making yourself less intelligent. Also I think it would be fair to say that many people interested in nootropics might be lacking in some fundamental areas such as consuming enough vitamins/minerals and exercising frequently. These two items should be the ""foundation"" of an individual interested in increasing mental performance, and they come with the desirable side effect of increased feeling of well-being. 

Exposure to certain modern pesticides is very likely to cause mental decline.
http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/04/110421082519.htm
If you can find it, there is an extremely valuable source of information in this area; ""Reducing environmental cancer risk, what we can do now."" This was a study done by the ""Presidents cancer panel,"" which received very little attention. These people are appointed and dedicated to perfecting the health of the president of the United States. I have the PDF if anybody is interested. This link may work: http://deainfo.nci.nih.gov/advisory/pcp/annualReports/pcp08-09rpt/PCP_Report_08-09_508.pdf

Boxing and other sports which cause head trauma obviously cause mental decline. A football player who consumes piracetam is likely just wasting his money because quitting football might be more effective than consuming many, if not all, nootropics. There are a few recent studies done in this area (boxing/football and brain scans)

There are also several studies which indicate a decline in IQ related to fluoridated communities. To avoid the ""alarmist"" association many people get from advising the avoidance of fluoride (fluoridated toothpaste and tap water), I follow the ""better safe than sorry"" rule. There are also many cases of pharmaceuticals ending up in tap water simply because they cannot be filtered out of the waste water. 

Other areas to consider: proximity to pollution, especially car exhaust(several studies indicate lower IQ to higher levels of exhaust in air), types of chemicals you use in the home or workplace, BPA exposure, alcohol/drug use, prescriptions you may not need and OTC medications such as benedryl may cause mental decline, bio-accumulation or bio-magnification of heavy metals and other toxicants in fish and farmed animals, (perhaps this is why vegans claim to ""feel better,"" since they are effectively detoxifying their bodies. It is extremely important to only eat organic meat if you do eat meat).
 

On to the supplements: I've tried many so-called nootropics, here are my experiences:
-Piracetam. Many different dosages from 1 gram up to 7 or 8. I've tried different dosages for different time spans, such as 3 weeks at 3 grams a day, 3 weeks at 1 gram a day, etc. I believe this to be as good as placebo. Also tried this with different forms of choline and cannot distinguish this combination from just choline.
-""Alpha Brain."" Many dosages, different time spans. I believe this to be as good as consuming just Alpha-GPC. I believe several of the other ingredients are active, including mucuna pruriens and vinpocetine, but was immediately turned off by the fact that they included GABA which doesn't work and cannot be active. The price is way too high for this product. 
-Mucuna pruriens. I noticed a general mental lift in problem solving and verbal communication. Also increased sex drive. The fact that this is used to treat the cognitively impaired elderly (L-Dopa) adds credit to this substance as one that performs better than placebo.
-Vinpocetine- very cheap and I believe it may be active, but cannot definitively say it's better than placebo.
-Rhodiola- I tried several brands and different dosages. I noticed that I became tired less or not at all while working. Also a possible general mood lift, but cannot say whether it's better than placebo in the nootropic category. 
-Bacopa - Cannot distinguish from placebo.
-Fish oil - Cannot distinguish from placebo because my diet is high in flax seed, although I'm sure it does increase mental capacity just based on the scientific studies.
Ephedra sinica- undesirable based on side effects
Kratom- does show some ""cognitive enhancement,"" but mostly I feel an opiate-like effect which is undesirable because of addiction potential. Coffee seems to carry the same benefits without a high addiction potential.
L-theanine- cannot distinguish from placebo
Adderal- undesirable based on side effects
Ritalin- Works very well for me, the 5 or so times I've used it. I found it to be at least psychologically addicting so I discontinued use. This seems to be very useful for the few times I may actually need something ""potent"" in the future.

I am brand new to posting here but have been a lurker for a long time. There's a lot of great advice and information available on every subject imagineable here and I look forward to being a part of future conversations from time to time. I have just received LiftMode's brand new batch of phenylpiracetam and I decided I'd start up a thread to discuss some interesting things about it.

Their new batch is very white and fluffy, a lot like their sunifiram, for example. Their last batch was a pale yellow color and more of a fine grown powder. You can see the difference in my photo links at the end of this post.

One possible concern here is the included analysis paperwork is from March 2013 and reports a &gt;99% purity as well as an off-white, pale yellow color. As you can see on the lid from the new batch, it's &gt;98% purity this time. Also, as you can see, it is pure white and fluffy this time and not a pale yellow color. Another issue of contention is the date of analysis. Mark at LM has contended that this new batch just got produced earlier this month and then re-purified just last week. If that's the case, why is this analysis paperwork from March?

I have sent Mark a link to this post and hopefully we can get a response. If he doesn't post a response here then I will include what he says in email. I would imagine somehow the correct analytical paperwork somehow didn't get shipped out with this batch and the paperwork received was from their last batch because the information and time matches the phenylpiracetam product I received from LM 4-6 weeks ago.

I have taken a 135mg dose of this new batch this morning and will report back later with my thoughts and feelings. Please feel free to discuss further as I will be checking back throughout the day myself.

Abstract

There is an increasing interest in nootropic drugs for the treatment of CNS disorders. Since the last meta-analysis of the clinical efficacy of piracetam, more information has accumulated. The primary objective of this systematic survey is to evaluate the clinical outcomes as well as the scientific literature relating to the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, mechanism of action, dosing, toxicology and adverse effects of marketed and investigational drugs. The major focus of the literature search was on articles demonstrating evidence-based clinical investigations during the past 10 years for the following therapeutic categories of CNS disorders: (i) cognition/memory; (ii) epilepsy and seizure; (iii) neurodegenerative diseases; (iv) stroke/ischaemia; and (v) stress and anxiety. In this article, piracetam-like compounds are divided into three subgroups based on their chemical structures, known efficacy and intended clinical uses. Subgroup 1 drugs include piracetam, oxiracetam, aniracetam, pramiracetam and phenylpiracetam, which have been used in humans and some of which are available as dietary supplements. Of these, oxiracetam and aniracetam are no longer in clinical use. Pramiracetam reportedly improved cognitive deficits associated with traumatic brain injuries. Although piracetam exhibited no long-term benefits for the treatment of mild cognitive impairments, recent studies demonstrated its neuroprotective effect when used during coronary bypass surgery. It was also effective in the treatment of cognitive disorders of cerebrovascular and traumatic origins; however, its overall effect on lowering depression and anxiety was higher than improving memory. As add-on therapy, it appears to benefit individuals with myoclonus epilepsy and tardive dyskinesia. Phenylpiracetam is more potent than piracetam and is used for a wider range of indications. In combination with a vasodilator drug, piracetam appeared to have an additive beneficial effect on various cognitive disabilities. Subgroup 2 drugs include levetiracetam, seletracetam and brivaracetam, which demonstrate antiepileptic activity, although their cognitive effects are unclear. Subgroup 3 includes piracetam derivatives with unknown clinical efficacies, and of these nefiracetam failed to improve cognition in post-stroke patients and rolipram is currently in clinical trials as an antidepressant. The remaining compounds of this subgroup are at various preclinical stages of research. The modes of action of piracetam and most of its derivatives remain an enigma. Differential effects on subtypes of glutamate receptors, but not the GABAergic actions, have been implicated. Piracetam seems to activate calcium influx into neuronal cells; however, this function is questionable in the light of findings that a persistent calcium inflow may have deleterious impact on neuronal cells. Although subgroup 2 compounds act via binding to another neuronal receptor (synaptic vesicle 2A), some of the subgroup 3 compounds, such as nefiracetam, are similar to those of subgroup 1. Based on calculations of the efficacy rates, our assessments indicate notable improvements in clinical outcomes with some of these agents.",,False,,t5_2r81c,1368651701.0,,,True,t3_1eenxf,http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/1eenxf/interesting_review_of_the_clinical_literature_on/,

Hopefully this can help a bit.

**[Test Results](http://i.imgur.com/qINHB3j.png)** (Ignore the iron results)

Background: Male, 28yrs. I have Iron overload, so have blood tests and venesections every 1-2 months. How to read the results above:

* First row is a test taken on March 21st
* Second row is a test taken on May 2nd
* The value at the end (XX-XXX) is the normal range for humans.

These tests were taken 41 days apart. Result == No out-of-range changes.

I started taking Aniracetam on April 10th. Between April 10th - May 2nd (22 days) I took approx. 20grams (~1000mg daily). Note some days I forgot to take my stack, 20grams is about what I consumed over the whole period. Daily stack:

* Green tea extract
* Aniracetam
* Choline Bitrate
* Fish Oil tabs
* Caffeine tabs (sometimes).

The thing about depression, is that you simply do not or have an extremely hard time procuring enough motivation to do something about it. On days when I wasn't feeling depressed or was actually in a good mood, I would accomplish a few things. These accomplishments made me feel great about myself and the work I did, but the motivation was fleeting and fluctuated from day to day so much that I could never get into the habit of being productive in my everyday life aside from the requirements.

I got a script from my doctor for Wellbutrin (Bupropion HCL) SR 100mg to start out. After a month when the effects kicked in I felt less depressed, but not exactly happy still, or with enough energy to motivate myself to do things. I was lethargic and apathetic still. I got bumped up to 150mg pills. Noticeable change for a couple weeks and then back to the same effect as 100's. I usually tried to self medicate with caffeine when I needed more of a mental lift, but that ended poorly for me with dependence, headaches, irritability, and simply not having a lasting effect.

I saw the movie Limitless and was instantly fascinated with the concept of a drug 'unlocking' your brain. I searched online and was brought to Dave Asprey's ""Bulletproof Executive"" blog where he openly mentions his use of smart drugs. After tons of reading and research I decided to give it a go. Placing my bet with MyModafinil as the most reliable source, I ordered 60 Modafinil and 60 Armodafinil.

My what a profound effect it has.

It wasn't a sudden clarity of everything I needed to do and how to do it like I was expecting. Modafinil DID however increase my mental clarity for thought and mood/creativity. I feel like I have the energy levels I need to be myself again. Coupled with my Wellbutrin pills, I feel myself in a good mood when I'm on it. I feel like doing productive things for once, and actually have the concentration I need to do it. It didn't make me so sensitive to light as much as being more sensitive to color. I could see more defined color in my life, like the contrast dial in my occipital lobe was turned up a few notches. I am more personable, and actually enjoy hearing the stories of others, and learning from their knowledge. 

Is modafinil a miracle drug for everyone? No of course not. Did it work for me and improve my quality of life? Hell yes

Recently I decided that I prefer Armodafinil (Waklert). I get some minor brain fog and headaches after being on Modafinil (Modalert) for about 5 hours on the comedown. It could just be stress at work or dehydration coincidentally causing that, but so far I like the overall daily experience I have when I take Armodafinil.

After taking a 100mg dose sublingually, I noticed some brain fog for the first 30min. After the initial fog subsided, the effects started growing. I got on a conference call I was scheduled to be on and I noticed the effects becoming very apparent around the 1.5 hour mark. When I took the nefiracetam last week, it took a pot of black tea to make it stimulating. The phenylpiracetam was stimulating on it's own.

So far I would say it's as strong as the nefiracetam at the same dose, with slightly different effects. At the moment I like it better. We'll see how it goes long term.

I will mention one thing that I found, but is not conclusive yet. I started getting kidney pain on nefiracetam, and some slight headaches. I took it for another day to confirm that the pain continued, and it did. I have now taken a couple days off nefiracetam and the pain has subsided. I am planning on taking it again next Monday to see if the symptoms come back. Until then I think it's too early to blame it directly on the nefiracetam.

Any help would be much appreciated as most of people that have severe cases of Mononucleosis (like me) typically experience 6+ months of CHronic fatigue and that is massively depressing for me to hear. 


Backround: *I'm am a 19 Year old college student and bodybuilder and previously very healthy (take all my vitamins ect.)

* Had my first symptom Oct. 18th 2012
* diagnosed with Mononucleosis via blood-test Oct. 23rd 2012
* Hospitalized twice for a total of 4 days (for minor paralysis)
* received IV Cortisone shot and IV Nov 28th 
* doctors could find absolutely nothing wrong with blood test except for elevated liver enzymes (which means close to nothing while a patient is sick) sent me home both times
* Started to feel less-sick about 3 days after cortisone shot (what the hell is the half life of cortisone(1cc)? can't find that info anywhere) 
* however the massive/debilitating fatigue continues off and on now... it is day 49 and I want to be better before next semester starts! 

Some of my current thoughts: 

*since the cortisone shot made me feel better: Maybe fatigue associated with mono is a result of swelling to a degree that induces [cerebral hypoxia](https://www.google.com/search?q=cerbral+hypoxia&amp;rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS436US436&amp;oq=cerbral+hypoxia&amp;aqs=chrome.0.57&amp;sugexp=chrome,mod=19&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;tbo=d&amp;rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS436US436&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=cerebral+hypoxia&amp;oq=cerebral+hypoxia&amp;gs_l=serp.3..0l4.2356.2356.0.2556.1.1.0.0.0.0.139.139.0j1.1.0.les%3B..0.0...1c.1.HuvJv1vcX_w&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;fp=baf96152d2c93bb7&amp;bpcl=39650382&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=643)?*

activity enhancer.",tukotih,35,10,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/xppzv/bpap_an_catecholaminergic_and_serotonergic/,"I recently found out about the pharmacological mechanism of catecholaminergic and serotoninergic activity enhancers and found the only (!) substance that has both of these actions. The only previously known CAE was L-Deprenyl, but it also has MAO-B, and to a lesser extent MAO-A, inhibiting action giving it a worse safety/SE-profile at the required dosages for a CAE-related response (~10mg). 


They work by a rather ingenious mechanism, allow me to quote Wiki:
&gt;BPAP (along with another similar compound PPAP) is classified as a catecholaminergic and serotonergic activity enhancer. This means that it stimulates the impulse propagation mediated transmitter release of the neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin in the brain. However, unlike stimulant drugs like amphetamines, which release a flood of these neurotransmitters in an uncontrolled manner, BPAP instead only increases the amount of neurotransmitter that gets released when a neuron is stimulated by receiving an impulse from a neighbouring neuron. So while both amphetamines and BPAP increase the amount of neurotransmitters that get released, amphetamines cause neurons to dump neurotransmitter stores into the synapse regardless of external input, while with BPAP the pattern of neurotransmitter release is not changed, but when the neuron would normally release neurotransmitter, a larger amount than normal is released.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzofuranylpropylaminopentane

So basically, normal CNS stimulants like Amphetamine work by releasing and inhibiting the reuptake of neurotransmitters spontaneously while the mechanism of CAE/SAE's increase the amount of released neurotransmitter in an natural response, reinforcing the strength of the signal.

BPAP also very strongly (I've never seen numbers like this) upregulates and increases neurotrophins like NGF, BDNF and GDNF.

**The novel catecholaminergic and serotoninergic activity enhancer R-(-)-1-(benzofuran-2-yl)-2-propylaminopentane up-regulates neurotrophic factor synthesis in mouse astrocytes.**
&gt;We investigated the effects of the novel catecholaminergic and serotoninergic activity enhancer R-(-)-1-(benzofuran-2-yl)-2-propylaminopentane ((-)-BPAP) on the synthesis and secretion of neurotrophins, nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), in cultured mouse astrocytes. The protein and mRNA levels of the neurotrophic factors were measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction methods, respectively. The amounts of NGF, BDNF, and GDNF secreted from astrocytes into the culture medium increased by up to 120, two, and seven times higher than those of the control, respectively, by treatment with 0.35 mM (-)-BPAP for 24 h. The increases in NGF and GDNF induced by the treatment with (-)-BPAP was inhibited by concomitant treatment with actinomycin D for transcriptional blockade. Furthermore, the treatment with (-)-BPAP for 6 h increased the mRNA expression of NGF, BDNF, and GDNF. These results suggest that (-)-BPAP up-regulated neurotrophic factor synthesis in cultured astrocytes.

1336680979.0,25,self.Nootropics,th0dp,A single 800mg dose of Oxiracetam made me hallucinate a little,Fred_Flintstone,32,7,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/th0dp/a_single_800mg_dose_of_oxiracetam_made_me/,"Two weeks ago I decided to try taking 800mg oxiracetam with no choline supplement at 10am with a pint of milk, 3 eggs on toast and a cup of coffee. I had a modest lunch at 1:30pm and dinner at 6pm. I worked a good 10 hour day learning some maths/engineering.

I went to bed at 12:30am, and woke up fully refreshed at 2am. This was unusual and inconvenient: I had nothing else to do but get back to work! 

So I sat at my desk and immediately noticed that my memory was fantastic. I could recall everything I had learnt from the day very very well. (I normally have to relearn things tonnes of times before they make it into my long term memory, and even then I tend to forget about stuff relatively fast. I have to set convoluted timetables on reviewing material to keep it in my head.)

I was able to create images in my head much easier and more clearly. I could rewrite some derivations/proofs clearly on paper and recall where in the lecture notes they were. (Top tip: some printers have the option of printing more than one page to a single piece of paper - I like to print 9 or 16 pages to a single page; to make some use of spatial memory and draw links between slides. It can become a pseudo-memory-palace-technique)

But when I noticed a black/white flickering in the bottom of the view of my right eye. It was a tad bit worrying, and because of the increased memory and otherwise normal day I attributed it to the oxiracetam. I've had colour saturation / sharpness-increases from piracetam and aniracetam before, so know that racetams do something with (calcium?) ion chanels and might affect vision. 

I then noticed a very subtle HPPD-like symptom: words on a piece of pair seemed to flow around a little, despite the paper being completely still. Very subtle, but definitely there.

I worked 3 hours then finally started getting tired again. I lay in bed and my head felt like an empty cave (hard to explain - but it was pleasant as normally my head feels like a stuffed suitcase after a long day of work).

While laying in bed, doing my best to not think of anything and go to sleep, I heard a voice say *""Good night, Fred.""* (replace Fred with my real name). I first thought ""who the hell is awake now?"" then realised I heard an imaginary voice. I was a little worried, but thought I would deal with whatever problems I had in the morning, and there was no sense worrying about it now. I was a little on edge the next day (partly as I slept poorly), and heard another voice saying ""yooohooooo, over here!"" at 1pm, while in a quiet public setting.

I hadn't taken any nootropics for about 3 weeks before the incident, and haven't since (except today, when i started another piracetam regime).

Oxiracetam lessens the strength of a filter between your subconscious and conscious; which is how it both improved my memory and made me actually hear a thought I did not even consciously think. It might be harmless but I wont be taking it again; there isn't long term research into its safety, and I've not read of others having a similar experience.

I have no history of mental illness in my family (except a grandma who has hallucinations because of her blindness: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bonnet_syndrome )

I've taken plenty of piracetam over the past two years (usually 2400mg daily for a month at a time, whenever I feel in the mood to do a regimen). I've tried oxi before, and it made me productive but did not have this effect (gave no noticeable memory boost either). I've tried aniracetam and pramiracetam before, and never in large doses. Never really had anything quite like this.

Rather, I should state: I have *added* TMG to my stack. My current stack is as follows,



Piracetam 2x a day @ 1.5g (in the morning and around lunchtime afternoon)

Choline citrate 1x (at night before bed) @ 1g

now I take TMG with the piracetam 2x a day @ 500mg (which is only ""half dose"")



Even though I have read no-where that TMG normalizes blood-glucose levels. I have found that it has completely ""cured"" my hypoglycemia. (I was diagnosed with that very early around 6 years old)
I used to always fall asleep in the classes that I had directly after lunch or breakfast. If a meal had any carbohydrate in it like french fries or I ordered a coke or sprite or any sugar drink my blood sugar would get super low about 20 minutes after. Anyway now with TMG no longer experience this. I think TMG also has anxiolytic properties. I am very calm and focused in class. and as you can see my stack contains NO stimulants. I have been off all caffeine for 2.5 months now (and loving the fact that i don't need it anymore). No ephedrine, adderall or anything else like that either.
In addition Trimethyglycine is insanely cheap. I highly recommend it for studying, learning, test taking, and social situations. The difference is subtle but my results are huge. I'm making A's on all my quizzes and I keep prioritizing studying before ""fun time"". I give it ten million thumbs up. Im open to any and all questions!

Obviously, this is just one, not particularly scientific investigation of these chemicals; but if there is any truth to some of the things these experimenters claim (such as volunteers remembering in detail long passages from readings that they skimmed on 2C-E-5Eto even days afterward), then these are seriously worth further investigating.

",Dozed,31,4,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/z8pzz/my_experience_with_choline_and_piracetam/,"I'm a noob when it comes to nootropics, but I thought I would post my experience, especially if it might help someone else. Background: I have moderate to severe anxiety disorder and bipolar disorder (depressive type mostly). I've graduated with honors in one Field of study, and I'm working towards another now. I became depressed and anxious in Jamuary, and I started taking an intense, condensed summer class that involved lots of memorization. I was also having trouble focusing, which is pretty standard for me. I began researching nootropics, and I decides to try what seemed to be ""the basics"" to me, choline and piracetam. I ordered them online in pill form. One day, my choline arrived but not my piracetam. I was studying and decided to take one choline pill just to try it out. I swallowed one and kept studying. I expected nothing because I believed that piracetam was the one that would garner the desired effects and choline was just there to prevent headaches. After I started studying again, I literally forgot I even took it. Suddenly, I had more energy and motivation and suddenly remembered that the deadline to apply to a university I wanted to apply I was very near. I flew through the application process and was finished in about twenty minutes. I noticed that I no longer felt depressed or anxious, and I couldn't figure out why. I briefly thought about it but started studying again and subsequently went to sleep. I woke up refreshes and feeling borderline hypomanic. I finally slowed down and remembered I had taken the choline. It was like my brain was breathing fresh air for the first time in years. It felt refreshed, replenished, and fully functional. I concede to the fact that this experience might be a result of placebo effect, but it seems rather unlikely because I completely forgot I even took the choline.

I won't go into a discussion too much here yet since that might taint the results. In a later post, I'll explain further. (If you dig in my comment history, you can find comments discussing this previously; if you want to participate in the questionnaire, I'd ask that you please not read through those until after you answer).

For the purposes of this survey, I don't really care about the distinction between modafinil, adrafinil, or armodafinil. I'll refer to it as ""moda"", but you can take that to mean any of those.

Finally, whether you have noticed moda tolerance or not, your answers to these questions will be valuable.

If you want to participate, just answer the questions below in a comment. Please post your own answers before reading others' answers.

-------------------------------------

1. What is the longest stretch for which you have taken moda regularly?

2. How often did/do you take it, and at what dosage?

3. Did you notice a tolerance effect? That is, did the effect seem to decrease with time?

4. How many hours of sleep do you get each night (on average), without moda?

5. Do you have difficulty falling asleep if you have taken moda within the last 6 hours?

6. Do you have difficulty falling asleep if you have taken moda within the last 24 hours?

7. Do you use sleep aids (sleeping pills, melatonin, phenibut, pot, etc. - it doesn't matter which) to get to sleep if you are having difficulty sleeping (with moda or without)? 

8. Did/do you take moda on weekdays, weekends, or both?

9. When you stop taking moda, do you feel normal (return to baseline) immediately, or do you feel worse initially? If you feel worse initially, how long does it take to return to baseline?

That said, I'm more interested in it for 2 purposes, the first is lucid dreaming and increasing REM, and the second is for energy metabolism and fat loss.

So, for the first, there's a lot of reports on the web (and in one book) about using melatonin in higher doses than normal to increase REM sleep time and dream activity and increase the likelihood of lucid dreaming.  Unfortunately, nearly all of these are ""[citation needed]"" situations, so I was wondering if anyone had experience using melatonin to increase REM sleep, the effects of it, and if it helped with lucid dreaming, preferably with some scientific studies to back it up (I checked and didn't find any).

For the second, melatonin has been identified as being involved in energy metabolism, and some studies in rats showed that chronic supplementation in drinking water reduced abdominal fat, potentially by enhancing brown adipose tissue activity to raise basal metabolic rate.  However, I haven't seen studies in humans, and I couldn't extrapolate a human-equivalent dose from the studies (they used a melatonin-water solution but didn't list the mg/kg dose), and additionally, the drinking water supplementation is strange because it means the melatonin was being taken during the day, so wouldn't this cause drowsiness?  Melatonin is always screwy because it doesn't necessarily make you sleepy, it just advances your circadian rhythm.

Melatonin's bioavailability is notoriously bad, although they have sublingual forms now so I'm not sure how that affects it, but dosing up to 50mg/day has been reported, the question is if it leads to the effects I mentioned above.",,False,,t5_2r81c,False,,,True,t3_1erhkn,http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/1erhkn/some_melatonin_questions/,

This problem is exacerbated by anxiety, and I believe that it stems from anxiety. For example, in a classroom setting the explanations I give to classmates pertain to the inner workings of some algorithm or protocol. I can explain them well in this setting, but the same questions when asked on a test become difficult if not impossible for me to answer. They are (I am pausing now, for over a minute... this is another problem ...) specific to the detailed instructions given in the question, and I cannot even parse the question correctly, and sometimes I cannot parse it at all. Indeed, questions that are testing my knowledge, e.g., ""what is the advantage of A over B?"" receive quick answers, and I generally get full credit. The problem, I believe, that this test anxiety poses is that it greatly inhibits my working memory.

I believe there are herbs that may help in this area, but it is very difficult for me to assess this, and I am reticent to actually try any unless someone else has been in a similar situation, tried them, and not had any issue. For instance, does anyone here have experience with the herb, Bacopa Monnieri? I am not a neurochemist, but based on how it affects dopamine (increases) and norepinephrine (decreases), I would think that it would decrease anxiety (which I would associate with the increase in norepinephrine that Concerta causes) while increasing focus (by modulating dopamine in the same direction as Concerta, though not by the same mechanism). I am hesitant to try this, however; taking two substances that act on the same neurotransmitters, both in unknown ways, may have a host of effects that I cannot predict. For example, raising dopamine may increase focus, but worsen memories, as changes in dopamine levels are implicated in memory formation. Similarly for norepinephrine: increased levels in the amygdala generally improve memory, whereas decreased levels make memory worse.

So, has anyone here taken both bacopa and concerta at the same time for an extended period and noticed any changes in their anxiety and memory, whether positive or negative? If so, what were the changes, and what bacopa product did you take? (I ask the latter because each product has a differing concentration of ""bacopasides A and B,"" and these affect its potency.

However, I've never seen bulk powder Modafinil being sold now a days, can anyone elaborate on this? These prices are very good compared to pills, as expected. ESPECIALLY when you compare the prices to official Provigil.


Ever since I posted the link, the quantity of the 100g (lowest amount, $149.59) dropped from 48 to 46.

I'm assuming at least one person from reddit was among those  2 orders.

I'm located in the U.S., and I'm concerned about such a large order of a Schedule IV substance being kept by U.S. Customs.
 
**I sent sunnootropic.com the following e-mail:**

*""Hello, I am located in the United States.*

*What is your success rate in deliveries of bulk powder Modafinil to United States customers? I ask this because it's a schedule IV controlled substance in the U.S., and there's a chance of it being held by customs. I've heard that some people have had their Modafinil (from other sources, in much lower quantities via tablets), seized by U.S. customs, but this is very rare.* 

*I am just more concerned from your source because of the very high amount via bulk powder.*

*I am planning on ordering the lowest amount, 100g.*

*Thanks!""*

**I got a response one day later:**

*""Hello ,ship by EMS is ok,will be no problem.""*

 
 


**Update**

*I talked to a customer service rep via the website's live chat. They basically said that they have plenty of U.S. customers that have had success receiving their Modafinil.*

Among the many strange dreams I had, here's a synopsis of the one I remembered best and had last...

Dream:

   I go to an okcupid blind date event. When I get there, the host leads me to a spot where I answer random questions of a bizarre or dirty sexual nature. The questions adorn the house and plants ranging from ""are you a scientist that doesn't smoke yet smokes a toad every once in a while?"" (Referring to that psychadellic toad), ""Can you read this? What band am I?"" (In some obscure font), and I can't really remember the other more interesting ones unfortunately. Apparently the system and questions don't mean anything, says the person running the event, and she tells me its just a facade (unconscious thoughts about OKC matching system?). 

I then meet my blind date who looks upset and ask her what's wrong. She sends me to her profile which is having problems or something. I help her with my amazing, novice CSC skillz. Then apparently as an activity I dye her hair after which she looks like shakira. This is incredibly sexah and we're alone in the women's bathroom. We talk about the singer and I complement her on her looks and I gain bonus points. Fast forward. There are random fish EVERYWHERE and she notices how sad one tuna is.  She asks me to do something about it so I steal it, put it in a grill out of sight of an assistant nearby(a tuna in a grill!? wtf? who knows...), go inside and wet some paper towels and get a plastic bag (why not just water?

I am shocked at the results i've had with piracetam, and i've only been using it for 3 days. 

I've been taking 800mg twice a day with 650mg of choline each dose.  I've taken adderall, which I cannot get a prescription to (no health care, and honestly I don't like drugs which are expensive, addictive, and have withdrawal properties.)  I am entirely positive that my results are 100% not a placebo effect; and not subtle at all, and I would compare it to my experience with adderall (although it doesn't make me feel jittery, doesnt last as long, and isnt as intense, or rather doesn't make me feel that ""high"" or ""speedy"" feeling, I am just looking for the concentration, and motivational aspects anyhow...)

with this said I have experienced some side effects.  After a full day I feel extremely fatigued, more than usual, and I can definitely feel a headache creeping up on me, which I've supplemented with an extra does of choline; which helps.   

After doing my research I am under the impression piracetam effects everyone differently according to their body chemistry. (like most drugs)  As a child I had pituitary problems which led to thyroid problems; so I am positive my brain chemistry isn't ""normal""; which may be why piracetam affects me so strongly.  

I am posting this for anyone who may be considering using piracetam, and might have questions.  Overall, it was well worth it for me and I will continue taking it, and adjusting my intake of it with choline.

But where are the downsides?,1_player,26,2,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/fmrow/adrafinil_is_a_wonder_drug_for_me_but_where_are/,"I've been experimenting Modafinil through its close cousin Adrafinil for about 6 weeks and it noticeably improved my behavior and attention.

I take 300mg Adrafinil as soon as I get up, and usually in 90 minutes I can feel its effects. I don't get any high, no peak, no plateau and no crash. *I just discovered I've been more productive at work in the last 6 weeks than in the last 6 months.*

**Typical day without Adrafinil:** arrive at work at 10, a bit slow after 6 hours of sleep, take coffee, get things done for 30 minutes, get easy distracted for a couple of hours (mainly Reddit), work 30 minutes and repeat till 19. Arrive at home and I'm pretty trashed.

**Typical day with Adrafinil:** arrive at work at 10, when Adrafinil should start to show its effects, I try to skip coffee as when I take it I'm a bit edgy, non-stop work till I get home. In 6 weeks I've opened Reddit at work a couple of times. I arrive at home, work on my personal projects for 2/3 hours and my day is over, satisfied.

I purposely do not take it on Sundays just to test any addiction capability, and while I do not get any craving or think about it, I feel noticeably slower.. like, normal. I'm usually happy the work day starts so I can be like a *superhuman.*

I experimented with Piracetam, Hydergine, Tyrosine, but nothing ever worked **every single day I take it**.

To me it is a wonder drug, but I think everything has some downsides. I do not think we've discovered something which works as expected without side-effects or worse, addiction.

I'd like to hear other experiences as well, because all this situation doesn't add up.

Maybe the downside is that I'm actually a ""better"" person with it, and, honestly, I do not want to be my ""old"" self.

I had an exam and blew through it twice as fast as the rest of the class with no perceivable mental effort, even correcting a mistake the prof had made in one of the questions.  In addition, I experienced a very nice sense of well-being after taking the piracetam.  Another unexpected benefit was that when I met up with some other students who were having trouble with the material before class, I was able to explain it all to them in a way they could understand.

My doctor also recommended some supplements, including tyrosine. The first day or so of taking it, I got a nice boost in motivation, it felt like I actually wanted to do things. After that first day, the effect never kicked in again, ever. 

Fastforward to December 2012, my doctor got ahold of a genetic test from Genomind, and it turned out I had a defect in the MTHFR gene (C/Y variety) that reduces my ability to convert folic acid/folate into methylfolate, resulting in low levels of serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine. I got prescribed 15mg of Deplin a day, which is straight methylfolate (plain folic acid/folate won't cross the blood brain barrier).

Since then, I've also been diagnosed with ADD, and I take 10mg of Ritalin three times a day. I'm off the SSRI now as well. After looking into supplements again, I'm considering giving tyrosine another try. Ritalin helps in a lot of ways, but I'm seriously lacking in motivation. 

My question is, is it possible the reason tyrosine worked great the first day, and then not at all, is because of the poor levels of methylfolate I had in my body? Do you think that since I'm on the Deplin now, and have the menthylfolate my body needs, would I see that nice boost of motivation I got the first day? Also, any idea of how the tyrosine would interact with my Ritalin?

I relate the feeling to using too many spritzes from cinnamon flavored breath spray, without the cinnamon flavor.

As far as effects, I would say the average time it takes to kick in is about the same as noopept... say 10-15 minutes. After the initial waiting period for the effects, I felt a slight change in perception and attention. I got that similar ""enhanced"" effect I feel from noopept, with a bit more of a rushing onset. Whereas noopept provides a gradual increase, I feel like sunifiram have a very quick onset for full effect. I was switching attention between an episode of Archer, and a conversation with my fiancé, and I felt like I was able to totally change my direction of thinking and experience whichever I was focusing on with full focus. There was a slight euphoria along with all of this as well. One of my first thoughts after the effects had kicked in was that sunifiram had accessed some hidden switch in my brain, flipped it on, and given my brain an extra jolt for mental processes.


The drawbacks? I have noticed that the time these effects last is seemingly very short. This could be due to the initial rush of effects taking place, alongside a taper effect (I feel fantastic after taking it, but after it starts to wear off, it really wears off fast). I really only notice sunifiram is taking effect for the better part of 2 hours, and then by the 3rd or 4th hour, the effects are gone. Possibly there will be a buildup with this?

I took another dose this morning before class (college senior) and felt the similar effects taking place. I had also upped the dosage by a slight amount (maybe closer to half of the 15mg scoop) and had a slightly better experience, without any brain fog. Yet, by the time I came back from class (1 1/2 hours) eaten (1/2 hour) and sat down for homework, the effects had mostly worn off again. 

Took a third dose along with 15mg noopept, 300mg nefiracetam, and 1 gram piracetam (in other words, added it to my normal stack) and can definitely tell a difference with sunifiram added to the stack. Everything is a little clearer than my routine Noopept, nefi, and piracetam. This dose has been over 45 minutes ago, so the effects are still warming up, but I believe I will continually add suni to my stack.

My usual supplier lost their ability to take Visa payments :-( So I thought I'd give these guys a go, given that they appear to have a good rep on here.

First purchase went like a dream.

The second has been a nightmare. I heard nothing for over a week. So I emailed, and to be fair saw some movement straight away. On past form, I expected my delivery on Friday. As things stand, I have an EMS Tracking number that appears to be invalid and no modafinil. 

I emailed them today to see if they were going to stand by the guarantee to resend on their website if nothing has been recieved in 16 days (today is the 16th day). Heard nothing yet.

So I'm a hefty chunk of money down, have no info on when things may turn up, an invalid EMS Tracking number and a load of research to complete.

Somebody give me something to feel less pessimistic about this whole deal. Or alternatively, take heed if you are about to make a purchase and think twice.

In the UK by the way, and have never had a problem getting anything delivered in the past.

*Edit 
**Update**: I'm going to post this here and in a new post - as I only think that's fair. The package **arrived** today after 17 days. I almost certainly wouldn't have posted here, had the initial transaction been smooth, but it wasn't. An order was allowed to sit idle for the best part of the week, until I acted.

That said, MyModafinil, have since responded pretty much as you'd expect them to. They've offered me a discount in future as a way of apologising. 

I still don't understand the issue with EMS - and it maybe in headquake's interests to try and explain what's going on - I've always been able to track an order fairly accurately and know what to expect when - this simply hasn't happened this time - this combined with the earlier delays *spooked* me.

Shipping was quick, packaging was nice.  I really appreciate when I get powders in a container instead of just bags.  This was also the first time I actually got a copy of the COA and the test data. 
As for the product, I really like it.  It kind of reminds me of when I was doing mega doses of piracetam.  I would only really feel effects of piracetam at 4-5g 4x a day.  When I started doing this though I would feel super motivated and mentally quick.  At 200mg of phenyl I felt the same effect with perhaps a bit more focus to the quickness for almost the whole day.  I did build up a tolerance for it really quickly though.  It's probably just best as a once in a while kind of supplement rather than a part of a daily stack.

First allow me to say that Hydergine really works. I felt it at relatively small doses (1.5-3mg).

The first two days of using were pretty hectic despite the fact I didn't really feel anything dramatic except for a slight improvement in my visual perception. Also it caused a mild case of nausea and occasional drowsiness which ultimately forced me to sleep the second day of use approximately 4 hours, during the day – that is while listening to music (which by the way sounded radically different, I think the substance made me feel somewhat high). Anyway, fortunately enough I didn't have much to do that day. 

However much non pleasing the side effects were, I decided for some reason that I really liked the effects of Hydergine – in particular its virtue of providing a subtle control over ones emotions; also primarily due to its capability of manufacturing a well-being feeling. Day three, I took 3mg in the morning on an empty stomach, and to counter any state of drowsiness I instantly had a caffeine pill (200mg) ready for that, which much to my surprise, did synergize greatly with Hydergine. Frankly, afterwards, I never felt that energetic in months. It was as if I had a massive adrenaline rush that drastically improved my mood and provided me with an utmost drive of motivation a body seeks for. I was ready to start doing anything. ANYTHING. I never felt that prepared - mentally and physically - in years. Plus I didn't encounter the side effects which I had the first two days during my trial; perhaps the only downside  I could think of (isn't bad actually) was the excessive amount of drive that had me wanting to go out and start a random fight with random strangers - a friendly fight, that is. Yes, mood was awesome.

I'm not sure if there is any overlap in noots that would help with lucidity AND retention of dreams - I've seen some information suggesting that if you take stuff to generate more vivid dreams it can cause the memories to be more choppy.

Even though in all other ways that was a horrible, horrible medication to be on, it was singlehandedly responsible for kicking me in the ass and getting me to start thinking about my future and stop wasting my life away in my 20s. 

I never budgeted before, I just spent money nearly as fast as it came in, and I figured as long as I maintained at least ~3-4 months of living expenses in the bank I'd be fine... ""for now"". I didn't contribute to retirement, I did workout a bit. My house was a mess -- papers everywhere. I was totally disorganized. I spent my weekends doing nothing at all. Smoking weed and playing video games. But when I got on prednisone, I organized everything. I spent hours with total focus, organizing my entire budget. I started maxing out my 401k, I made a ridiculously detailed and elaborate spreadsheet to track my finances and for the first time in my life made a budget for myself and made an effort to stick to it. I made 1, 2, and 5 year goals for myself. I bought a filing cabinet and top down piled up every single piece of paper in my house and grouped everything into piles on the group. It was like that scene in Vanilla Sky where he's preparing to go back to work and has piles of papers all over the place as he studies stuff. Once I sorted everything out, threw away all the stuff that was trash and the rest was filed away into the filing cabinet. I organized most of my house. I did the research necessary to go back to school. I started buying groceries and cooking my own food. I did 5 years worth of back taxes and collected about 10K in tax returns (I missed out on 2-3k due to waiting too long). I started reading the news and di a ton of research about the economy, investing, and the financial crisis. I basically became an adult. 

Once I got off the prednisone I maintained some form of all this organization. The filing cabinet was probably one of the best moves I've ever made, and I still maintain it. I've been doing taxes every year. I no longer let my mailbox pile up till it's so full the mailman has to return everything to sender. I automated all my bills where possible so I never have late rent or bill payments. I got credit cards to start building credit. But after I stopped the prednisone it was more like I was able to maintain the organization systems I had set up for myself while on the pred, but nothing new was really done. Recently I had to go back on it again for about 8 weeks, a much smaller dose, and life got a little better again. This time I started caring more about my work, and taking the effort to learn new programming languages and tools and API's, and work on open source projects that I had been wanting to do forever. 

In the years after the 1st prednisone experience I was shocked at how productive I was. I was like, ""so THIS is what it feels like to be normal, and get stuff done!"" So i went and got a prescription for adderall, and then vyvanse. These medications were not the same. They made me hyperfocus on shit that didn't matter, and didn't give me motivation to get my life in order or to accomplish long term goals. It was like tunnel visiion. I would waste entire days, and weeks reading stuff on the internet that I was interested in, watching porn. It was like, whatever I was interested in, that interest was magnified 1000x, and I couldn't pay attention to anything else. I don't like the person I become when I'm on those med's so I quit them. I take tiny amounts once in a while because of the slight motivation or drive it gives, when I need to do work that is mundane. 

Sorry for the long post, but my question is, are there any nootropics that will have more of an effect like the prednisone in terms of drive and motivation? Mood enhancement would be welcome, and I think that was also an effect the prednisone had. Right now I just take fish oil, just started c25k. I am getting a script for generic Provigil soon and I will give that a shot.

**Day 1: 4/9/2013 nighttime**

6 months have passed since I began taking Adderall. It has helped me tremendously with being able to deal with my stress load as well as with motivation and writing laboratory reports. However, I feel as though it has negatively affected my test taking abilities since it takes me longer to actually finish problems because I am writing more and more and becoming more elaborate with my answers even though it is not needed. The more I have become involved in r/nootropics, the more I have realized my mistake with beginning it in the first place. It has not increased my cognition, only simply allowed me to work on things for longer.  The more research I did on it, the more I realized how bad it was for me. I found out today that research on its neurotoxicity indicated that dopaminergic neurotoxicity was present in squirrel monkeys [found here] (http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/315/1/91.long). Secondly, this has also been shown to be present in mice albeit in different dosages here which I have known since beginning the drug, but my psychiatrist dismissed my fears saying that I shouldn’t worry about it [mice](http://www.quora.com/What-are-the-long-term-effects-of-Adderall-Dexedrine-or-Ritalin-use#). Ritalin has been found to be neuroprotective and it seems like a good idea to make the switch (to me at least), but this would be at least 3 more months down the road because I still have 3 months of Adderall left and I don’t want to risk any more damage to my brain or my heart (since both could possibly be [cardiotoxic](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2518387/). Also, even though there has not been enough research on the topic, I do not want to risk getting Parkinson’s disease as well as being dependent on it my entire life. It has also made it really difficult for me to keep a stable hand while working in the lab and since I want to become a doctor I don’t want to have to deal with this problem later on because dependence may be more of an issue. I have taken breaks before off Adderall but quitting forever will be difficult. I don’t have issues with abusing the drug (in regards to taking large amounts of it) and have never really had a psychological need to keep taking it. The only thing that I have experienced before while taking my breaks is severe depression because normally you are supposed to taper off of it. The depression goes away after two days and this log is to keep track of how I am feeling.

I plan to quit by substituting caffeine in at the times that I normally take Adderall and possibly 3x a day if needed. Then I will return to my normal cycling of caffeine to using it 4 x a week; once a day on the weekends and twice a day on days that I don’t have to work in the laboratory. Here goes nothing.

**Day 2: 4/10/2013 12:09 pm**

Took 30 mg XR x 1 7:30 am this morning. I will not be taking my second dose at night which is 10 mg IR. 

I mainly took XR today because I have a test and didn’t want to be negatively affected by quitting right before my test began. 

**Day 3: 4/11/2013 7:00 pm**

I feel like shit right now. I felt on top of the world for 30 minutes this morning but then I became extremely sad, unmotivated and tired for the rest of the day. I think I did a good job of hiding what I was feeling in regards to my classmates but it was extremely difficult. I don’t feel like I need Adderall per say but rather that a whole wave of negative emotions that were suppressed by Adderall have come back all at once and it is much too overwhelming. I screwed up my culturing at lab today because of how horrible I felt, my coworkers did a good job of not making a big deal out of it. Somehow I managed to do my Biology reading and finish my Spanish readings today, probably because of caffeine even though I didn’t feel like it helped that much; I need to sleep now, everything is just too much for me. 

**4/11/2013 11:00 pm**

Woke up from my nap and feel slightly better. I still don’t feel like 100% right now though.

I am going to brush, floss and get ready for bed. It is going to be really easy to fall back asleep at this point.

**Day 4: 4/12/2013**

Today is so much better. I am at 90% and I am happy to say that the worst part of my withdrawal is over. The caffeine is making a bigger difference today. 

**Day 5: 4/13/2013**

I feel normal again. I am so glad that this is over. It is time for a nice, long run.

(TLDR @ bottom)",Guacamolium,25,2,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/18zgu0/a_wildly_unbalanced_then_serendipitous_adventure/,"So it was either here or on Longecity that someone was offering free samples of a nootropic product called Nootam, and I asked for one.

The guy I contacted told me he'd get me a sample out to me by Tuesday (it was Saturday). By Thursday, I asked him if it would be next Tuesday that he'd meant. Long story short, he forgot to send my sample. He offers again to send my sample and a couple hours later he tells me he's going to send the full bottle for free for the screw up.

Thinking this was a stand up move, I offered to post a review of Nootam for him for his generosity. 

My first dose was at the beginning of a full work day, and I experienced a clean, subtle focus - not too noticeable, really. Everybody else was drinking energy drinks, I abstained for once. As the label says, you can take another one in 4 hours, so I do. Again a slight clean energy/ focus, maybe a slight edginess.

We're working a big landscaping job, and the 8 hour shift turns into an 11 hour shift. So I take a third one an hour and a half before we're done, and that's when I just start getting confused. I get edgy, impatient, place the wrong garden bed in the wrong place, etc.

I get home and I'm still a bit out of sorts. Don't take 3 in one day I tell myself.

Next Day: I take one, and for whatever reason I'm unwarrantably impatient. Odd side effect. Noopept, CDP-choline, Sulbutiamine, and PS have never had that reaction in me, must be the ratio.

Day 3: Same thing, I take one, and I'm impatient with everything, everybody, inanimate objects, what the fuck....

Day 4: I take 25 mg DMAA (methylhexanamine), which I like to take as a mild, clean, anxiety-free, short acting stimulant. At this point I'm not even planning on taking Nootam now that I took DMAA, but something in me said ""what the hell,"" and I took a Nootam against my earlier intentions.

*Completely* different experience this time. All of a sudden the problems I had had with Nootam weren't there anymore. It was like the 25mg DMAA was skyrocketed beyond its usual focus and motivational qualities with more pronounced nootropic effects. I feel great!

Day 5-15 I don't miss a day without my Nootam pill and my DMAA pill, and things are great while I'm on it. I'm assertive, motivated, confident, and just overall good well-being.

I have a *theory* for why it started out terrible and then great:

Noopept, being cumulative in its effects, clearly was at a point (4 days of accumulation) to potentiate the glutamatergic action of  DMAA, Sulbutiamine in the frontal lobes, and to a lessor degree, caffeine. Furthermore, CDP-Choline (whatever dosage it actually is in this formula) regulates glutamate overabundance in the brain by glutamate uptake and simultaneously increases the availability of dopamine and noradrenaline, thereby potentiating the dopaminergic action of DMAA and caffeine as well while keeping glutamate over-stimulation in check. 

The cholinergic components of both CDP-choline and sulbutiamine are surprisingly a small factor here in contrast to the glutaminergic/dopaminergic responses, but at least serve a minor amount of cholinergic presence for the minor demands of Noopept.

Another quirk worth noting here is the accumulation effect Noopept has and its notoriety for BDNF release. Couple that with how supplementation with CDP-choline can increase the amount of choline available for acetylcholine synthesis and aid in rebuilding membrane phospholipid stores after depletion, thereby leading to proper phosphatidylcholine, and thus phosphatidylserine synthesis in vivo.

So we have a low affinity choline uptake environment created here that delegates the phospholipid structures (phospatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, etc.) to be produced more so than acetylcholine by citicoline, coupled with Noopepts' BDNF release. Quite a desirable environment if my theory is accurate. 

This was definitely an interesting experience for me for sure.
I plan to keep taking 1 Nootam, and 1 25mg DMAA until they run out, which looks to be about 12 days. If you read this far, thank you for your time and I hope you got something out of my experience.

**TLDR:: I asked for Nootam sample, guy forgot to send, sent me a bottle for free for his mistake, Nootam made me impatient and edgy  until on day 4 I took DMAA with it which completely turned things around and led me to investigate the mechanisms of why that all happened.**

I would take 5mg without tolerance and take breaks every now and then. 

I ordered 60 modafinil and 60 aromodafinil (mixed pack) from mymodafinil.net on Saturday, January 19th. It shipped on Monday the 21st. I was worried for a while because the tracking was not updating, but then I saw on their site that it does not update until it gets to US customs. I received the package on Saturday, February 2nd. 

Anyways, I stayed up pretty late last night (1am) and woke up today for work at 730am. I was feeling pretty tired like usualy because I am used to sleeping in and just started a job that I have to wake up for in the morning. It should also be noted that I have been diagnosed with delayed sleep-phase disorder (DSPD). 

I have read to not start with a full 200mg dose at once, so I took 100mg of modafinil in the morning when I woke up and put the other half of the pill in my pocket. I took the other half after my lunchtime meal.

**Here are my pros and cons:**

+Was able to stay alert during relatively boring computer work

+Was more personable towards the people I work around

+Not much appetite suppression

-Dose wore off after lunch and I found myself falling asleep after a big lunchtime meal

-Lacked the mood lifting drive of d-amphetamine with still generating the anxious &amp; physical side effects

-Felt dysphoric and unable to relax after work

+/- Time went by VERY quickly. 


So far I am not impressed. I liked that it did not suppress my appetite like amphetamines, but it still generated anxiety and make me feel pretty ""out of it"" for the relatively low amount of benefit I got from the  drug. It was 5pm before I knew it, and I cant blame that on having fun unfortunately. I'm not sure I like that effect on time it had for me.

I've enjoyed it but I have had no will to over indulge.

Similarly, I seem to be able to stop much easier on alcohol. I can have one or two beers and stop... whereas before I often liked to binge drink.

   Intelligence is the material of human achievement. Every distinction between humans and mere animals is the result of our overlarge supercharged brains. We are animals who have been granted by the circumstances of our evolution power to order our world to an extent and scope never before seen on this planet. We are the rulers of the ecological community. However, we are only so through the machinations of the blind system that created us--evolution.

  
   For the past 50,000 years and more the individual human brain has not substantially changed. Our remote hunter-gatherer ancestors were as intelligent as we are today! All of our great achievements--flight, skyscrapers, discovery of DNA, etc.--are the work of the collective intelligence of the species. The “hive-mind” is talented in some areas but weak in others, such as long-term planning (our inability to solve global warming) and morality (the continued existence of genocide and war). A society of minds informed only by evolutionary signals can never transcend the animal kingdom from which we arose. 

  
   To fulfill our potential and become completely human it is necessary to further develop our individual minds. The field of cognitive enhancement exists to do just that. 


   Imagine the consequences of, for example, a 25 point increase in intelligence worldwide, or even simply among those involved in government. Such a shift would change the course of history in radical ways. What may strike you as science fiction is not far off in scientific terms--the fields of neurology and psychopharmacology are moving quickly and our understanding of the biological infrastructure of intelligence grows accordingly. You know how it is said that people use on average only about 10% of their brains? Through advancements in medical science, it will soon be possible to use a vastly greater percentage and eventually even exceed the brain’s biological limitations. 


   The safe and effective “smart drugs” that are our best bet for sustainable cognitive enhancement are just around the corner. In fact, the first generation has already arrived.


   There exist a few options for those looking for a mental boost, starting with caffeine, a minor stimulant. Its effects on focus and wakefulness have made it ubiquitous in western culture. Then there are the psychostimulant drugs such as Ritalin and Adderall prescribed for ADHD and related illnesses. Their effects on alertness and retention are famous on college campuses for their usefulness as study aids. However, Adderall and its relatives are more productivity enhancers than intelligence enhancers, and their beneficial effects come with the risks of neurotoxicity, heart problems, and addiction. 


   More promising is the large and diverse class of chemical known as nootropics. The term “nootropic” refers to any substance that improves mental function and is neuroprotective or at the very least entirely nontoxic. To qualify as a nootropic a compound must be effectively free from negative side effects. The original nootropic is Piracetam, first synthesized in 1964. Scientists quickly noticed its beneficial effects on even healthy brains and its spotless safety profile (intact through over 40 years of study). Its primary effects are a substantial increase in verbal memory and recall, as well as a noticeable gain in the perception of visual and audial contrast. I have taken it for about four months and the benefits are obvious (40$ for 500g on amazon!).


   Another nootropic is modafinil, a non-addictive wakefulness promoter used by the Air Force on long missions. It reduces the need for sleep and can keep users awake for 36 hours without fatigue. DMAE (dimethylethanolamine) and choline are precursors to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is heavily involved in learning and attention. Vinpocetine is a vasodilator which enhances cerebral blood flow and communication between the hemispheres of the brain. Many other nootropics exist in various stages of research, clinical testing, and use--the more we learn about the biological basis of intelligence, the better able we are to deliver focused and safe therapies to enhance it.


   Intelligence is not one monolithic trait. Instead it is a loosely connected set of mental functions including memory, focus, recall, planning, cognition, problem solving, and the capacity for abstract thought. The complexity of these interwoven systems slows progress in the study of cognitive enhancement. It may be possible that our minds cannot operate on a level too much higher than they do now--the hardware may simply not support continual intelligence gains. It is clear, however, that some enhancement beyond our current level is possible, safe, and effective.

Perhaps I am sharper and more focused, but haven't noticed because it gradually improved over the last week. I still get distracted, I still forget things, and I still sometimes struggle to find just the right words. There has been no feeling as if a fog has been lifted or any such revelation.

One thing I have noticed, however, is that my dreams are quite vivid and I remember them better upon waking. One dream last night was disturbing enough to cause me to wake myself up.

So I woke up at about 1:50am, went back to sleep and had another dream but I don't clearly remember that one.

Thank you for all that trail-blazed before me.  I read a lot here before I ever spent a dime.  I am 38 and exercise regularly.  I give myself a 7 on a scale 1-10 where ten is the best re: diet quality.  I always do the multi-vitamin and basic nutrition supplements thing.  Always get plenty of veggies.  I usually get 8 hours of sleep.  I have been settled at 2-3 cups of very dark coffee in the morning for a long time.  Sometimes if I only had 2 in the morning I'll have another after lunch.  I also sometimes need a night cap or a shot of ZzzQuil (Diphenhydramine) to go to sleep at a decent hour.  

I have traditionally been an herbal remedy skeptic and tried things like Ginko before with no result so was discouraged but after reading about these things over and over here and then vetting elsewhere, I decided on this progression:

* Week 1: L-Theanine (200mg w/coffee), Rhodiola Rosea (500mg in morning) &amp; Melatonin
* Week 2: Piracetam &amp; Choline
* Week 3: Moda or Armo (only 1x/wk.  alternate weeks a couple times to see differences)
* Eventually (after we conceive a child later this year or early next year, hopefully): Bacopa monniera

Week 1 almost complete.  

Melatonin I have figured out I need about 2mg 1.5 hours before I want to go to sleep.  It leaves me a little groggy until I've had my coffee in the morning but within an hour or so of waking up I feel really good.

Actually, I feel REALLY good.  L-theanine (suntheanine) with coffee and the Rhodiola in the morning.  I have noticed markedly less anxiety and sense of focus + well being.  Many times over the last week I have caught myself present in a way I have not felt for a long time (like maybe 20 years long time).  I have been able to control anxiety and recover from stress events more quickly.  None of this in an apathetic/lethargic way - I am just as motivated as before and less prone to procrastination.

And none of this in a wonder-drug kind of way.  I'm not going to go evangelize in the streets.  I'm just saying there is a noticeable difference in my state of mind.  Thank you for the posts and FAQ (the ""work"" here) that convinced me.

******  
I've been lurking on r/noot for quite some time and have been fascinated by nootropics.  I understand that everybody reacts differently to racetams, and have done quite a bit of independent research on the subject.  That being said, I have noticed many posts describing personal experiences with racetams, however I have not seen many describing the differences between some of the most popular ones.  I was simply hoping to begin a thread where some of the more 'experienced' racetam users can describe their experiences with different racetams and perhaps even combinations (an even less covered topic on this subbreddit, perhaps more appropriate for r/stackadvice?).  And by 'more experience', I simply mean those of you who have had the opportunity and time to experiment with various racetams (primarily piracetam, oxiracetam, pramiracetam, aniracetam, noopept).  I will start of with my personal experience and understanding of nootropics.  Feel free to add your own input and let me know of any inaccuracies and suggestions!  


Here is my experience and understanding of nootropics thus far (and I will attempt to make it brief):

**DISCLAIMER:**
First off, let it be known that I am currently taking zoloft (a common SSRI for anxiety/depression) as well as mirtazapine (an NaSSa - or  noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant - supposed to help me sleep - lol yeah right... It is also an antidepressant tho).  I understand that many nootropics act on the serotonin receptors in our brains and that there is a risk for serotonin syndrome.  I do not encourage others to do what I have done because everybody reacts differently to these drugs.  That being said, I have tested myself with various recreational drugs while on these medications and have concluded that I am at very low risk for serotonin syndrome.  Some of you may still criticize at the risks I have put myself in, but I assure you that I have tested my risk for serotonin syndrome in a gradual way by slowly increasing the numbers and dosages of serotonergic drugs I am taking, and for some reason, simply do not ever have symptoms even CLOSE to what would indicate serotonin syndrome.  However, it is a serious risk and anybody on an SSRI or MAOI should be aware and cautious of this potentially *deadly* syndrome.  


**My stack currently consists of:**

* L-Theanine + caffeine

* SAM-e

* 5-HTP

* Huperzine A

* CDP-Choline

* Green Tea Extract

* Fish Oil

* Creatine

* Bacopa monnieri  


**My reasoning:**  
  

**L-Theanine + caffeine**  
L-Theanine is a component found in green tea.  It is sold as a supplement to aid in relaxation.  It can readily cross the blood brain barrier and reach the brain.  When taken in combination with caffeine, many nootropic users claim that it produces one of the most beneficial nootropic effects by relieving the jittery, speedy feeling that caffeine can produce while at the same time relaxing the mind and allowing it to focus.  In a way, it produces the 'best of both worlds' and appears to work in a synergistic way.  Both L-theanine and caffeine appear to be very safe.  A 2:1 ratio of L-theanine to caffeine will switch your brain into 'god-mode' when trying to study for an exam or do work.  Additionally, make sure your L-theanine is from Suntheanine as this is the only reliable source that contains a good source of active L-theanine.  Other supplements have been shown to contain mostly the inactive evil twin of L-theanine (D-theanine).  
  

**CDP-Choline**  
CDP-Choline is a better source of Choline than lechin (2.5% - 9.5% choline - usually derived from egg or soy), Phosphatidylcholine (13% choline), choline salts (now were getting there, much more concentrated!).  There difference between other choline sources and CDP-Choline or Alpha-GPC is that CDP Choline can readily pass the blood brain barrier (bbb), which is where choline is converted to acetylcholine and produces its neurotropic effects.  Many people take choline suppliments without anything else, which most likely is a waste unless you are choline deficient.  Most choline is broken down in the bloodstream and has virtually zero nootropic effects.  It must pass the bbb to have any desired effects.  This is why I chose CDP-Choline.  And by supplementing with green tea extract, this prolongs the time it takes for the choline to be metabolized, thus providing more time for it to pass the bbb and have its nootropic effects.  Furthermore, Huperzine A is a  acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, which will lead to an increased concentration of acetylcholine in the brain.  Too much choline in the bloodstream as well as too little choline in the brain can cause the common side-effects of brain fog and headaches when taken racetams.  I think the people that complain about this side effect and immediately attribute this to the racetams they have tried are simply not supplementing with the right sources of choline (lechin or salts - thus too much in the bloodstream) or are not taking choline at all (thus leading to too little choline to be used by the acetylcholinesterase receptors).  
  

**SAM-e, 5-HTP, Green Tea Extract**  
Furthermore, SAM-e has been shown to decrease depression and have possible nootropic effects WHEN USED WITH AN SSRI.  There is little research of SAM-e having any effect when not taken with an SSRI.  It raises both dopamine and serotonin levels in the brain (again, be aware of serotonin syndrome).  Additionally, I take 5-HTP which is a precursor to serotonin.  Similarly to the effects Green Tea Extract has on choline, Green Tea Extract prolongs the conversion of 5-HTP to serotonin to serotonin thus giving the 5-HTP more time to pass the blood brain barrier.  Again, Serotonin Syndrome is a possibility.  Though serotonin is commonly targeted by antidepressants for its properties of increasing a sense well-being and happiness, it has also shown to positively impact memory and learning.  
  

**Creatine and Fish Oil**  
Creatine and fish oil are just good for you.  Plain and simple.  Of course, there is the threat of mercury in fish oil and other impurities, this is easily resolved by finding a good source of fish oil.  I take krill oil because it has recently been proven to be much more beneficial than plain old fish oil.  Creatine is especially good for exercise as it increases the water that is held in the body and allows longer time for nutrients to be taken up and used by the body.  I had been taking these supplements before I even started taking any nootropics.  
  

**Bacopa monnieri**  
Bacopa monnieri has been used in India throughout much of its history and according to research have a positive impact on anxiety, and learning and retaining information.  However, it takes a long time to have statistically significant nootropic effects (up to eight weeks).  Anxiolytic effects can be felt sooner.  Its method of action is still under debate.  It can also cause digestive issues and tastes (and smells) like straight ass.  
  
  
**My thoughts so far:** 
Meh.  There may be a difference, but if there is, it is minor.  However, what can you expect from taking these supplements.  L-theanine with caffeine has been the most beneficial to me, but I never had an issue with caffeine jitters and cant confirm that it reduces this negative side-effect of caffeine.  When the racetams that I have ordered arrive (piracetam, pramiracetam, oxiracetam, noopept) arrive, I am most likely going to cut out everything but my choline-CDP, L-theanine + caffeine, and bacopa monnieri supplements and see how that goes so that I can avoid the 'kitchen sink' of supplements that I am currently on.  That isn't to say that I have noticed any negative effects while on this many supplements.  I would just like to experience racetams on their own to be able to accurately quantify their effects.  
  

Jesus this was long... my bad.  
  

*tl;dr*: Lets talk about your experience with different racetams!  Which one is your favorite, what are the effects of each one?  Differences?  My experience with various nootropics without racetams has been sub-par thus far and I am looking to add racetams to my stack.

**EXPERIENCES!!**
Just got my order of noopept, pramiracetam, and oxiracetam in the mail today!  I thought I was going to get my order of bulk piracetam first, but [Newstarnootropics](http://www.newstarnootropics.com/index.php) beat [Nootropicsdepot](http://nootropicsdepot.com/) with the shipping (only by one day, both were fantastic suppliers and had very good customer service, I have talked with representatives from both sites and can pledge that they are very helpful, speedy in replying, and know a lot about their own products) Shoutout to user [ParMatrix](http://www.reddit.com/user/ParMatrix) for helping me out with the products they sell at nootropicsdepot and for giving me first hand suggestions on what to try next!  
  
Now for the review:  

**Dose: 40mg Noopept sub-lingual** (I thought the scoop that newstar supplied me with was 5mg scoops, OOPS lol)  

I only took noopept for my first dose of racetams.  Would have liked to start with piracetam, but I couldn't wait till friday (no shipping tomorrow for the 4th of July) lol.  Completely stopped my previous stack except for the bacopa, L-theanine, and caffeine.  My results?  Awesome!  I did not experience the vivid 'increased-perception' colors that some people on this thread have expressed seeing, however I *did* definitely feel somewhat of an absorption of everything that was around me.  I noticed the effects of the noopept nearly 20 minutes after dosing. Its almost as if I was processing everything that was happening around me, no matter how insignificant.  I had minor headaches start almost instantly, but CDP-choline (250mg) instantly relieved these symptoms.  I felt happy, relaxed, and extremely focused.  I do find myself getting absorbed in tasks... this is extremely beneficial for studying.  However, I need to make sure that I study as I found myself transfixed in front of the mirror for 40+ minutes in attempt to get the 'perfect' shave LOL.  So far, the effects have been fairly mild (as I expected) but definitely there.  Its not like other drugs where you get a 'high' or a completely altered state of reality.  The best way I can describe it is simply an enhanced state of thinking.  Processing information faster, absorbing more, thinking in more abstract and unique ways, etc.  Very interesting first time, can't wait to see where the next few days will take me!

In a moment of vacant mindedness, I threw in 500mg of Choline Bitartrate with my 1g Aniracetam attack dose. I've never supplemented Choline before.

Anyway, quite simply, I felt *very* depressed by the end of the evening. I took way too much Choline *for me*. It took 3 days to get back to normal. I really underestimated just how bad I would feel from over-supplementation.

Remember, everyone is different, don't trust anyone else's attack dose - start small.

As an aside, the Aniracetam experience was very interesting. It's hard to divorce the Aniracetam effect from the Choline-induced depression in that first experience, but I found it had a lateral effect on my thinking. 'Sideways' best explains the effects - thoughts I'd never had before, words I wouldn't normally use. It certainly will relate to creativity and problem solving.

Since then, I've had a number of days where I've had 400mg Ani + 100mg Choline Bitartrate in the morning, followed by a second dose of 300mg Ani a few hours later. I felt 1g was a bit too strong of a shift of 'head space'.

I'll still stick to Piracetam as my base nootropic, because my personal stack goal is mood improvement. I may use Aniracetam occasionally instead of (or perhaps with, after I've done some research) Piracetam, when I'd like that lateral effect.

I'm new to posting on Reddit.  I have come to have an interest in Nootropics and I am interesting in trying some.  However, the issue of reliable suppliers came up.  Despite the fact that there is a fine list of suppliers of differing quality already available, I thought that I would  provide another that was evaluated to a lesser degree.  I thought that if, for various reasons, I posted another list of suppliers of nootropics that I just gathered, that we might expand the list of quality suppliers if people had already tried some of these outfits.  

In distinguishing them, some are small and dodgy and others look bigger and more reputable. Most are in the USA and a few others are not.  I included these other suppliers since a friend has used a supplier from overseas that was effective, I thought that they were potentially viable alternatives  

I hope that some good comes of this for this community.

* Source: mymodafinil. Reddit discount, which was much appreciated.
* Dose: 150mg
* Time: 9:30am

I had no strong inclination towards choosing one over the other, Armodafinil or Modafinil, and only really picked Armodafinil for aesthetic reasons, being the ""purer"" and newer form of the drug.

Prior expectations: Relatively high. I've been interested in Modafinil for a long time. Stories of people turning into machines and productivity skyrocketing, etc. So I was hoping to do a ton of random things that would help me get on top of things. I do keep a pretty open mind though and like to judge things for myself, so I just wanted to see where it would take me.


Noticeable effects:

* Ate almost nothing all day. Had no appetite.

* Did notice jaw clenching and some other sort of ticks, biting the inside of my cheeks, and picking the palm of my hand that has callused from riding my bike.

* Time seemed to go faster than I've ever experienced. Would look at the clock and then turn around and look back and an hour went by. If was different. I will not place a value on it, good or bad.

* Did not notice any increased mental acuity, not that I expected any. When writing I would make just as many mistakes as I usually would.

What I accomplished: After about an hour I was browsing the internet like a fiend, reading tons of articles. Nothing productive though. And then after that I spent almost 14 hours straight editing a friends 'Personal Statement' for an application to Med School, No food and a little water, only getting up to go to the bathroom a couple of times. I went to town on the paper. I was into it, but a little too much, I would say. Basically editing and editing and editing, most likely way passed being helpful. And that's all I did. Would have like to have felt like there was a little more higher level processes going on, but it just felt somewhat low level. So I guess robotic does seem to be accurate here. I wanted to do other things but found it difficult to pull myself away as well. A little OCD-like. And then it was 4am.


Conclusions: Felt ""wakefulness"" in the simplest sense of the word. That's actually the best I can describe it, so it does **exactly** what it purports to do. I was fully awake and never not fully awake. I didn't feel a single inkling to go to sleep, but I did also worry a bit about it messing with my sleep cycle in the coming days. I took it in the morning hoping it would wear off by midnight, but it lasted much longer then I had planned. Probably the difference between the two drugs.

While reaching primary cognitive ability is of primary concern to me, it is also vitally important to avoid tolerance and adaptation. 

The human body is exceptional at maintaining chemical equilibrium. Caffeine (up-regulation of adenosine receptors) is perhaps the most cited case, but it is naive to believe the body does not react similarly to unnatural levels of other chemical compounds. 

For me, having to dose myself to reach a baseline, normal cognitive state--or do avoid debilitating withdrawal effects--is an serious long-term concern.

Personally, I feel like this aspect of supplementation is often brushed aside, but is perhaps the most paramount attribute--we are attempting to improve upon human physiology, and trading a long-term decrease in energy or anything else for short bursts is more hacky-reallocation and actually a net-negative.

The body is so well-optimized that one could argue against all supplementation. I do believe intelligent supplementation can be a net-positive, but only because the demands and conditions of industrialized life are very different from what our body has been optimized for.

I definitely noticed an improvement in mental clarity and sharpness (I'm a vegetarian btw) which is why I kept taking it (originally started taking it for weightlifting, got busy stopped working out). Long story short, it caused kidney dysfunction. Fortunately a couple weeks after stopping use my kidney function returned to normal. I just wanted to post as a warning to be careful with Creatine. There is a chance, however, that my problems were due to it being in tablet form (and perhaps some of the other inactive ingredients caused my problem); maybe pure Creatine powder is not a problem. 

EDIT: Sorry, first wrote this on my phone. More details:

I used UNIVERSAL Creatine Chews (grape flavor). Purchased on Amazon.
Serving Size: 4 chewables = 5g Creatine Monohydrate
Inactive Ingredients: Sucrose, dextrose, stearic acid, natural and artificial flavors, malic acid, magnesium stearate, and carmine.

I found out about the kidney dysfunction because my blood pressure skyrocketed. Im usually around 110/65, and it launched up to around 140/90 (it was high enough to where I could feel my heart beating in my chest, and feel my head pounding; probably because im very skinny I can feel it) and I started getting rapid heartbeats and irregular heartbeats. My dad has hypertension so I thought shit, maybe Im starting to get hypertension.

So I went to the doctor and he had some blood tests done and my creatinine, sodium and potassium levels were all elevated (elevated potassium levels were the likely cause my of cardiac irregularities). So these results were indicative of kidney dysfunction. I stopped taking creatine for 2 weeks, got re-tested, and all was back to normal.

Test results:

CREATININE

Emotion is a large part of being human, and as tempting as it is to be rational as can be, emotion brings many advantages. Being more in touch with one's emotions has the potential to improve sympathy for others, and even empathy in difficult situations. This, in turn, can improve one's social life, and -- being social creatures -- is beneficial for neurological health (in terms of general well-being and mood, which can make all the difference in terms of motivation and productivity). What's the point of being extremely logical/rational if you're friendless? Emotions have the capacity to improve our lives.

Are there any nootropics (or maybe compounds not thought of as nootropics) that improve emotional ability, response, or awareness?

My first guess is perhaps Naltrexone (low-dose). Be it physical or emotional pain, the brain's response is the same.

From what I've been reading on here, modafinil seems like it would be the most beneficial since I always feel mentally exhausted. I get plenty of sleep at night but always need an hour nap during the day. Caffiene works great as long as I also get L-theanine, otherwise i crash in a couple hours. Adderall just gave me a general feeling of well being, unlike caffeine where I feel super energetic, alert, and excited, shortly followed by anxiety then sleep. 

Anyway, I probably should see a doctor, I'm just feeling guilty about wanting something that I shouldn't. On an unrelated note,  I've been taking extra vitamin D, and it seems to have helped a lot with  depression.

For example: [Bacopa](http://examine.com/supplements/Bacopa+Monnieri/#main_clinical_results) - and I know you guys love to reference it.

The problem is that it's a bit daunting, and confusing for those that don't know the jargon. For those that don't know (I am going to simplify here), statistical significance just means that the likelyhood of the result (increase, decrease, no change) was likely due to the supplement and not chance. Generally, anything which was less than 5% likely due to chance is considered ""statistically significant""

The problem is that statistically significant only gives you the ability to discern the cause/effect relationship. It does literally zero for how big the actual effect is.

What we really need to do is combine the two to make sense of it.

So we've been slowly but surely adding clinical significance to our database too. This isn't live, and it is definitely subjective to some bias, but all of our data is live and thus open to pointing-out-our-flaws.

So to that end, the question was - what value does the human trials database have? Ideally, it's a bunch of fill in the blanks: _[supplement]_ has a _[strength of effect]_ _[direction of effect]_ on _[attribute]_. For example, **Creatine** has a **strong** effect **increasing** your **power output**.

So would love to solicit your guys' feedback. [Here's how bacopa's will look like](http://i.imgur.com/gOtcvu3.png)

Would love for you guys to first take a quick glance and see if it makes sense ...

Okay so - the idea is now we can visually tell you what effect it has (increase/decrease/no effect), the magnitude of the effect (from irrelevant to strong), and the consensus of the research (automatically generated, basically the # of studies that show the same direction of change vs total # of studies). We also have comments, and then the previous ""show studies"" link (which will now be in a modal popup).

Also importantly we have really tightened up the grading - you can see that bacopa had 2 As and 5 Bs, and now has 2 Bs and 5 Cs (it's not such a straightforward downgrade, it just happened this way for bacopa).

- Wikipedia has useful info and links to several key references about indeloxazine: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indeloxazine

- Indeloxazine was originally developed as a pharmaceutical in Japan in the 1980s by Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.

- Indeloxazine underwent preclinical and human clinical trials in Japan and Korea, and was approved for use as a cerebral activator and neuroprotective agent, mainly for patients recovering from stroke.  

- The dosage for this indication was shown as 20 mg tid (three times daily). 

- In 1998, after substantial sales (http://www.thepharmaletter.com/file/60141/yamanouchi-looks-to-new-products-for-growth.html), indeloxazine was withdrawn from the Japanese market, because it was judged not to have benefits superior to placebo for stroke patients.  http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2805%2979232-1/fulltext

- http://www.lookchem.com/Indeloxazine-hydrochloride/ lists animal toxicology data and references for Indeloxazine HCl.

**As a potential teratogen, Indeloxazine MUST not be consumed or handled by pregnant or nursing women, or by women who might become pregnant.**

- Indeloxazine has effects mediated in part through the monoaminergic neurotransmitter systems (serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor / releasing agent, norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor). 

- Therefore it is advised NOT to combine indeloxazine with any medications or supplements that also interact with serotonin or norepinephrine. Such medications and supplements include: 
 - prescription antidepressants (particularly MAOIs, SSRIs, and tricyclics)
 - ADHD or stimulant medications (amphetamine / amphetamine derivatives, methylphenidate, modafinil, etc.) 
 - OTC stimulants (diet or weight loss aids, energy drinks, stimulating supplements including yohimbine, ephedrine, synephrine, hordenine, DMAA, high dose caffeine, etc.) 
 - Serotonergic supplements (including 5-HTP, L-Tryptophan, St. John's Wort, etc.)
 - Any medications, substances or supplements associated with Serotonin Syndrome (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome)

- For those working with Indeloxazine as a research nootropic, its potency (10 mg - 80 mg) means it is essential to have a mg accurate scale to handle and measure it safely.

I'm relatively new to using Nootropics, and so far I've found that this works great. I took one scoop's worth (is it 150mg?) a day, mixed with L-Theanine and a cup of coffee. Typically when I sit down and do work, my head gets bugged down by thoughts that eventually get me too angry to focus on anything I'm doing, and then depressed. This causes me to have about a 20% time efficiency, leading to anxiety when I can't get my work done on time. Sometimes it gets bad enough for me to have to wake up at 3am (1-4 hours of sleep a night). 

When I took this stack I still had these thoughts, but I was able to catch myself and clear my head easier. Thus I was finally able to finish my work. With lessened anxiety (I don't know if this was more from the L-Theanine or from the Phenlylpiracetam), what typically takes me an hour (20 pages of a school book) took me 20 minutes. 


I also play tetris friends (username: azndvn), and typically I max out at around 70 lines. However, on my third game I took my max up to 87 lines. I've done 4 games now with close to 90 lines, but never quite surpassing that.

I've had anxiety and depression for a while now -- maybe 10+ years. Although its not debilitating, it is definitely life-interfering at times. After a few provoking situations that have occurred within the last couple years, I finally decided to get help from a counselor and a therapist.  My current therapist is using CBT, which has quelled the anxieties/running thoughts pretty well. However, I still feel like I am in a ""funk"" of depression that I can't seem to shake --- no motivation, not liking activities I used to, feeling as if I need to be detached from everything, etc. Unfortunately, depression and anxiety run in my family, both paternally and maternally.

The therapist recommended that I try out an SSRI in tandem with psychotherapy. After doing research and talking with close friends of mine that have been on antidepressants, I can't seem to make a decision to take them one way or another. I was given a prescription for 60 x 10mg of citalopram (generic for Celexa) to start. My trepidation is typical; that is, fear of side effects and withdrawal symptoms.

So, my question:  What would be an appropriate start for alternatives to SSRI's, preferably for mood-lifting? So far, I've read about the basics like vitamin D, fish oil and inositol from various subreddits.  I have tried inositol and l-theanine before for a few months, which had only marginal results. In the assumption that I eventually take prescription antidepressants, are there any combinations that could complement SSRI's without much fear of overloading on serotonin?

Now I feel I may have walked into a psychiatric diagnosis for no good reason as I'm dumber than ever on lithium. Turns out that the increase in gray matter and synaptic neurogenesis is arguably the brain trying to compensate for being dumbed down by lithium. Specifically, my impression seems to be that physical gains/changes are the brains equal and opposite reaction to the signal downregulation that occurs with lithium.

That said, titrating up on lithium and maintaining a high (but sub-toxic dose) would still increase gray matter and capacitate neurogenesis, so I'm wondering if taking a course of lithium treatment (which, let me tell you, definitely dampens cognition) might provide the benefit of enhanced brain growth/development which would stay after tapering off the lithium.

So, I guess like the mind equivalent of running with ankle weights to gain strength but then shedding them to get a further boost after letting the body strengthen and adjust back to baseline.

Any thoughts? I can also tell you for certain that Lithium is either interphering with my Adderall or the cognitive dampening is cancelling out the focus and alertness benefits.

I used piracetam and pramiracetam both for at least two weeks on a consistent basis but never felt like they had many positive effects.

Piracetam - taken at a dose of 4.8g.  At first this just made me tired and lazy.  I tried both choline bitartrate and cdp choline in varying doses.  What finally worked for me was taking choline before bed.  Generally the effects of piracetam seemed subtle, but I noticed that colors appeared more vibrant and it generally improved my mood.

Pramiracetam - doses of ~200mg.  Positive effects were hard to gauge.  I felt like my speech had become more fluid and articulate but it's possible that this was a placebo.  After 2-3 weeks of taking pramiracetam daily, I realized that it was sapping my motivation and energy.  I began to question whether I had the motivation to get through an undergraduate engineering program.  The first day of not taking pramiracetam I felt incredibly motivated and energized.  Decided not to take it again.

Aniracetam - doses of 1.5g.  This stuff really worked.  Unlike the other racetams I've tried, I felt this stuff instantly.  The first couple days of taking it I felt like I was on some kind of mild hallucinogenic.  Where as piracetam made colors more virbrant, this stuff made my vision seem significantly clearer, as if everything was in a higher resolution.  I'd notice so much detail in everything.  The outline of all the leaves on trees were very apparent.  Textured surfaces looked more interesting.  Everything seemed so much more detailed and interesting.  For a couple days after class I'd just drive around looking at stuff for fun.

THE GOOD
----------
* Phosphatidylserine - Esterified form of Omega-3s; decreases exercise-induced cortisol (at 600-800 mg), may attenuate mental stress (at 200-400 mg), may increase attentiveness in ADHD (at 300 mg). (60 200mg $40, $0.10 /200mg bulk)

* Acetyl l-carnitine - Metabolite of l-carnitine; antioxidant, increases insulin response, may increase attentiveness in ADD over time (at 500-1500mg). (120 500mg $22, $0.4 /500mg bulk)

* Alpha lipoic acid - Powerful antioxidant. (180 100mg $14)


THE BAD
----------
* Vinpocetine - Probably addictive. (60 10mg $10) &lt;--- Might be bullshit.

* Ginkgo Biloba - MAOI. (60 60mg $8)

* Rhodiola - MAOI A/B.


THE UGLY
----------
* Magnesium - May mitigate restless leg syndrome, may lower cholesterol, deficiency causes symptoms of anxiety, ADHD, insomnia. May increase sleep requirement, magnesium citrate (the most bioavailable form) is a laxitive. (250 200mg $14)

* Magnesium-l-threonate - Prohibitively expensive form of magnesium that crosses the blood-brain barrier; increases memory retention and plasticity in rats.

* L-carnitine - Counteracts bone aging, antioxidant, may decrease fat/increase muscle (at 2g l-carnitine-l-tartrate).

* CLA - Anti-cancer, weight management (at 3.2 grams). Racemic mix can cause insulin resistance, fatty acid redistribution, heart stress, particularly in obese individuals. Cis-9 trans-11 CLA (rumeric acid) is harmless, but unavailable. (90 750mg $11)

* Bacopa monnieri - Counteracts diazepam (valium) amnesia (at 8g), may increase memory retention over time (at 300mg). Other positive research exists, but from dubious ""alternative"" or ""ayurvedic"" oriented journals.  (125 225mg $16)

* Cordyceps - Hypoglycemic: helps with insulin resistance. Otherwise useless.

* CDP Choline - Intermediary between acetylcholine precursor choline and phosphatidylcholine that crosses the blood-brain barrier; increases acetylcholine levels in vitro, increases dopamine and acetylcholine receptor densities in aged mice, prevents memory impairment in aged and impoverished rats, may increase attention and decrease reaction time (at 500-1500 mg). (120 250mg $36, $0.20 /250mg bulk)

* Alpha GPC - Another form of choline that can cross the blood-brain barrier; increases acetylcholine receptor density in aged rats. No studies on healthy humans, except to evaluate safety.

* DMAA - A stimulant similar in potency to caffiene. Has rapid tolerance increase, may cause ""stim dick"".

* Piracetam - Positive allosteric modulator of AMPA (glutamate) receptors which may increase brain plasticity, neuroprotective, increases activity of the corpus callosum. Causes headache that can be alleviated by choline supplement, should be administered multiple times per day. (60 800mg $23, $0.07 /800mg bulk)

* Aniracetam - Reportedly more potent racetam than piracetam; Anxiolytic in mice through dopamine/acetylcholine/5-HT2A receptor mechanism, positive allosteric modulator of AMPA (glutamate) receptors which may increase brain plasticity, neuroprotective.

**SURVEY LINK FOR THOSE IMPATIENT** http://bit.ly/oO3JtH

Hey there Reddit.

My name is Colin Popell. 

I’d like to share with you the first public statement about my new company, Noo-Mix LLC. I took a look at the current nootropic market, and it leaves much to be desired.

A lot of the supplement market lacks a scientific bearing, and unfortunately this is true for a lot of nootropic suppliers as well. This is a problem, because I’m a firm believer that the nootropics market is one that should be supported and helped to grow.

So I decided to do my part to change it. Noo-Mix LLC will be a science based, as transparent as possible, research friendly company built with the help of, and to the benefit of, the communities it interacts with. We won’t sell you any supplements we can’t find data that supports, we’ll conduct tests and gather data as much as possible, and we’ll pull products we find to either have adverse effects or no effect.

**How are we going to do this?** I am trying to build the most comprehensive data set of the effect of various stacks, demographics, interactions, backgrounds, and any other variables that might affect interactions with nootropics.

We’re also pretty sure we’re going to offer a few features no other company yet offers, but we’ll keep that on the down-low for now.

**Where do we want to go with this?** Well, fairly obviously I’d like the company to grow and make money. I’d also like to spread nootropics more into the mainstream on college campuses (less reliance on amphetamines by people who don’t understand them), clear up misconceptions of nootropics, and gather the largest database of nootropic interactions in the world.

I’m a transhumanist too, and I’d like to use this as a platform to help support the transhumanist community. All of my investors are going into this with the understanding that a portion of our profits may be reinvested into other emerging technologies, using this company as a launch platform. I don’t want to go into details here, but you can bet that money will be going into interesting projects in both drug and technological research.

**How can you help us?** Pretty easy, actually. As ambitious as my goals might be, I’m only starting out with a finite amount of cash. So linked at the top and bottom of this page is a survey on your nootropic habits. Feel free to fill it out in as much detail or as little detail as you want (though more is obviously preferable to me), but please fill it out. The more people who fill it out, the better data we’ll get, and the better we can optimize our initial expenses. Plus it gives us market data so that we can get more money from investors to expand faster, and to serve our customers better.

Sorry, tl;dr That’s okay, I know it was wordy. Basically, new supplement company wants to set a scientific and business standard, wants your business, wants to support the community, and wants data on your nootropic habits.

So here goes:

**Piracetam:**

Moderate increase in mood at 4g a day, vivid dreams. Possible Improvement in the % of my vocabulary I use, but nothing obvious intelligence-boosting wise.

**Amphetamine:**
 
10-15mg dexedrine a day, depression &amp; tiredness went *poof* while on it the 1st few times(including after taking a break), never took it long enough for an addiction to form. 

Stuff rocks for staying up late, but it made me act kinda tweaked in class (constant talking.)

Worked great for getting shit done, not sure if the work was better or worse than it otherwise would have been because it wouldn't normally have gotten done.

**Ritalin:**

18mg Concerta (XR); Like the Dexedrine but less tweaky, more teeth grindy, and the 1st time I took it I got really paranoid and huddled in a corner till I stopped feeling high, so meh.

**Modafinil:**

200mg provigil a day - OMG FTW!
Seriously this stuff is great for me.

Can't sleep and it's now 3am? 100mg and gaming till it's time for uni, another 100mg just before lunch, crash out at 8pm barely feeling tired.

Home late and it's now 3am? 100mg and sleep for 3 hours waking nice and alert, 100mg more a couple of hours after waking.

Need to get stuff done, do all-nighter? Feel like shit, but something about the delerium associated with not sleeping makes doing things easier.

I really can't say enough about how modafinil makes my life functional, The constant low-level tiredness just disappears. Also, I don't need 12 hours sleep now.

Advice:
Don't try to go longer than 48 hours, the mild hallucinations start right on schedule.

Getting less than 6 hours a night still builds up a sleep debt.


**Take-away:**

To grind work or improve mental performance i'd choose dexedrine.  To deal with tiredness(whatever the cause) I'd choose provigil.  If I didn't want stims I'd screw about with piracetam and choline again.(If only for the psychological effect the ritual aspects involving OJ and bitter-as-hell powder has for me.)

**Also:**

1. I have a diagnosis of mild asperger's disorder, and I definitley have co-morbid depression that comes and goes.

2. Mixing caffine with any of the above stims raises my blood pressure and heartbeat uncomforably. 

3. Modafinil gives me a funky finding on liver function tests, I've had to have them re-done. (dehydration?)

4. IQ tests hovered at 128 &lt;-&gt; 132
(tried to leave a couple of months between each test)

I swear I am not trying to come in here and just be a troll, I have serious concerns regarding the actual effectiveness of piracetam.

My friend is a biomedical engineer, and quite an intelligent individual, I also like to pride myself on research.  Anyhow after using piractem for quite sometime I really did not notice any substantial effects.  Looking into research and studies has yielded virtually no supporting evidence.  The amount of studies that conclude there is a somewhat measureable effect seem to only illustrate this effect in individuals who have suffered brain damage or mental illness.

Here is his email he sent to me:


Dear [redacted],

I have spent the last three hours reviewing the findings of dozens of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover studies related to the effects of piracetam on cognitive function. The results appear to be mixed, with outcomes ranging from no detectable difference between piracetam and the placebo, to some reporting a statistically significant difference (and some even finding negative side effects of piracetam that were not evident in the placebo group). 

So overall, I still don't think I have enough information to determine whether piracetam is effective. I'm going to do some more research and look into several other nootropics next, I'll let you know what I find.

Sincerely,

Honorary Dr. [redacted]

I made a comment in another thread that I'm actually doing a sleep study.

I don't have problems going to sleep, sometimes I wake up due to nightmares/sleepwalking/etc., but can go back to sleep. I generally sleep well over 8 hours.

I started using modafinil a few weeks ago. I wasn't as tired then, certainly having sleep issues, but functional during the day. I used it as needed. When I started seeing a positive difference - mostly in terms of focus, which is really why I was trialing it - I started taking it more regularly.

I would say that for about a week, a week and a half, I have been taking it pretty much every day, at varying doses. At least 100mg per day though, generally 200.

So this is what I'm trying to figure out: From what I understand, modafinil doesn't affect the quality of the sleep you do get, compared to a more classic stimulant. However, if you're getting tired, it could be due to you building up a sleep deficit and not noticing it. That's what I think is right - but I've been getting way over 8 hours every night, and it seems that the longer and more regularly I take modafinil (and this is only for a little over a week), the less benefits I see, and the more groggy I end up feeling. This can't be explained due to ""missing"" sleep, or even really tolerance, since I wasn't this tired to begin with, so what's going on? The title ""rebound"" sleepiness, was from the term for ""rebound headache"" - you take a ton of pain meds to stop a headache, and then you'll trigger a new headache from using so many pain meds. The answer is to stop pain meds, but it's too easy to just keep popping Advil. So maybe the answer is to stop modafinil to break the cycle? But I don't have *any* medical evidence for this, just trying to figure out how I ended up in such a terrible situation with this sleepiness.

[I'm posting this in r/Nootropics because I don't think this chem should be promoted any more to people of r/Drugs due to it's nature. However I believe, possibly naively(!), that you lot are somewhat more responsible.]

I recently tried out Amfonelic Acid. I'm sorry for the long wait. It took ages to arrive. Three weeks to the UK, one week in a customs sorting office waiting for me the pay the (extortionate) customs fees and another few days to get to me. 

Anyway I've had a few trials with it and if it wasn't a goddamn anti-biotic I'd still be on it! I should make some warnings here. It is very addictive and it is also an anti-biotic. This means that if you take it for a number of days/weeks/months it could cause serious damage. We just don't know the extent to which it is effective. At 20-30mg it is a selective dopamine reuptake inhibitor but is it effective as an anti-biotic at 10mg or 1000? 

If 10mg then we need to be very careful, overuse could lower natural bodily defenses leading to increased risk of infection. MRSA is but one of the potential outcomes.

If 1000mg then we may be able to indulge further and I hope to god this is the case but even so it will be habit forming and aforementioned outcomes could still arise after hearty addictions have been filled.

Now that's out of the way I can get around to describing this magnificent bastard. After an allergy/potency test at ~2mg, I bowled ahead to 20mg (slightly haphazardly using a single account from the bluelight thread as a guide), which produced nothing thankfully, well almost nothing. I felt a slight rise in energy
and euphoria but close to maybe one cup of coffee or 40mg speed (~50% purity but cut with caffeine so it would be hard to gauge in comparison to adderall, sorry). I already had a significant dopaminergic tolerance so this wasn't surprising. My one and only guide had stated 25mg efficacy so if you are tasting use
that as a rough medium dosage before starting out.

The next day I pushed it to 30. There was definite action here. Like the previous day, it was euphoric but with higher energy. This wasn't quite an average dose but I was getting somewhere. It was subtle but I was very aware of the smaller details of life. I was processing information faster, I was happier, euphoric you could say and to a substantial degree. It was wonderful. After an hour or so I jumped another barrier and insufflated 10mg. It hit quickly but it only seemed to extend the action, possibly elevating it only slightly. Total duration of 8-10 hours including extension.

It's very smooth with no stimulation in the normal sense of the word but it certainly was a cognitive enhancer. Everything seemed so fluid and easy to access. A really wonderful drug. I felt like I could do everything but I just wanted to relax at the time. Not like with speed where I have impetus and drive to work. The day after I found it was tugging at me again. ""Just a little"" it said, but I declined for health's sake. 

A week after prior ingestions I have taken 45mg orally. It set in quickly after about 30 minutes but didn't really show full effects until about 45 minutes to an hour later. This dose really is the upper end of the scale, which is what I wanted to experience but not quite to this extent. My tolerance to dopaminergic drugs seems to have decreased since the previous trials, not to mention the lack of increased tolerance due to the previous day's ingestion. 

I think taking into account the second, insufflated dose could have been my error but hindsight's 20/20. My pulse is at 126bpm (an average dose of speed has my bpm at around 100-110) however even at this level it doesn't really seem too aggressive, it's soft almost.

My principle reasoning for knowing that it's a high dose is due to my heart rate and a decline of skill when playing FPS games (an unfortunate side effect of higher doses of stimulants). I can of course feel the strong stimulant effects but it's still unbelievably smooth. Euphoria is high but mind is clear. A similar dose of speed (relative to bpm) would have me pushed to the limit, struggling to maintain composure. I relate that level to being a fish out of water; I'm strugggling to breathe, talking is strained, muscles are tensed up and my mind is rushing a mile a minute causing me to freak out every five seconds. With AFA there is none of that. My mind is focussed, my hands are a little jittery but it's nothing serious,  I'm a little concerned for my overall wellbeing but aside from that no strong paranoia or anxiety. The complete lack of norepinephrine gives such wonderful insight into the dimensions of heavy dopamine increase which I am more than happy to experience.

It's beautiful, clean as a whistle, almost perfect. There isn't too much I'm taking onto my plate either. With amphetamines I tend to get distracted or try to juggle two or three tasks at once, but with this I'm fairly content to keep my mind on one thing. There is a fair bit of muscle tension resulting in jaw aches moving my extremities to release energy. The action of the drug seems to be waning 
but I would expect similar tension on this level of any stimulant. 

At about the 6-7 hour point I am beginning to come down but again the main reason I can tell is due to a lower heart rate at 114bpm. I think I should be back to baseline at the 10 hour point. At T+ 8hrs I'm still fairly stimulated but my heart rate is lower at 108bpm, similar to a normal dose of speed. I'm starting to feel a little strung out too but it's not too bad. The jaw clench seems to increase as time goes by as does the tension in my neck and back. I also have a mild headache. While these probably couldn't really be classed as effects from a comedown I'm not too surprised they weren't present on previous occasions given their relative peace in comparison. 

T+10hrs: Still stimulated. The tension started to piss me off so an hour ago I dropped 80mg codeine to smoothen it out. It's been effective for the most part. The AFA while seeming to slowly die out kept up until the very end. At 14 hours my heart rate was at 102bpm and I didn't sleep until the 15th hour but not through lack of trying.

The experience mentioned in the Bluelight thread said a duration of 5-6 hours at an average dose so this also demonstrates both my error in judgement and it's power at this dose. However I would imagine baseline would be reached at perhaps eight hours for an average dose and six hours is just the duration for noticeable effects. I reckon a perfect dose at this (slightly lower than last week) tolerance level is between 30 and 40mg threshold around 10mg and at previous trial tolerance level between 35 and 45mg.

This compound would be a wonderful study aid and general drug of abuse and most likely subsequent addiction if it weren't for those antibiotic effects which is probably for the best in all honesty. I would love to know how strong it actually is as an antibiotic but I still don't think I'd risk using it for more than a few days if it did have a higher dose for those effects. It's not worth the potential risk when there are other similar compounds available. The price alone would outweigh the gain, which I believe was relatively low as the synthesis is a fairly difficult one by all accounts. It was a worthwhile experience but I doubt I will repeat it except on rare occasion or if a little more information comes out about it's antibiotic properties.

* Late 30s, Male
* History of depression in the family
* Just recently lost my job so feeling some depression
* Studying MBA, IQ around the mid to low 100s but no genius and highschool dropout. Troubles with comprehension and reading. 
* As a child I was thought to have some form of attention deficit issue. 
* Smoker

Source:
OTC piracetam 800mg. I live in a country where it is prescription only but that means you just have to say please when you ask for them OTC

Dosage:
Day 1 3.2 mg
Day 2 3.2 mg
Day 3 3.2 mg

Other:
Melatonin (1 day)
Fish oil

Experience:
While I understand that it can take several weeks to get to a level in my system where it shows the greatest effect, I thought I would share my first few days. 


* What I have learnt so far, the mix of Melatonin is not good for me. It left me extremely tired and ill, thou I had a cold/flu during the time. But am not willing to try again.
* Although I experienced some of the effect of piracetam they where not as grandiose as some people describe in their first couple of days taking them. 
* I was studying for an exam which was on my second day of experimentation. I had some major issues with recall, to the point that I believe I probably failed the exam. 
* I did see some vibrancy which people describe with colours but that lasted only for an hour. 
* However contrary to the above, I do feel that things are crisper and clearer. This will sound ironic but the light from the sun seems to make things look warmer. 
* Anxiety is lower.
* Energy seems higher. 5 minutes after waking up I am active, prior to the last few days it would take me a few red bulls to feel like this. 
* No longer taking redbull, staying awake till 3am working/studying and getting up at 9:30
* I am 183 cm (6'2) and 110 kg (~240lb). I strangely enough do not eat a lot, but the last few days my appetite has increased. 
* Although piracetam is OTC, I have not been able to buy Choline. So I did initially experience headaches. 
* I found myself dancing to music .... I don't dance it is number 1 in my rule book. But I know some people have said they feel music with more clarity. 
* I noticed that I seem to be engaging people more in conversation. This is unusual as I am a quiet person and living in a country where my native language English is a second language. 
* Frequent urination, though could be due to a flu I was experiencing. 
* No lucid dreams.

My initial impressions are, the effects seem very subtle at first. I didn't realise them initially but they do seem to be there. There may be a placebo effect, but who care if I am feeling overall better. 

It is definitely no NZT :) but I was not expecting that. I am thinking or looking for some further things I can experiment with next month, while on piracetam. 

So far I think it is working, but not 100% sure however if the overall feeling can continue then I am thinking it is worth continuing. 

Notes:

* Keeping a journal
* Creating a list of books to read ( thought I would try a reading experiment as I am horrible at reading )

Sometimes that is the case, due to a study's goal of ensuring that certain toxicities can be observed. However, the dosages are NEVER directly related to humans. You cannot take a study that gave 100mg/kg of a substance to rats, then quote it as if we are talking about human equivalents. Rats metabolisms are different, just like mice, dogs, rhesus monkeys, etc. There are also other things to take into consideration, like differences in CYP450 enzymes, or lower hormone/antioxidant levels. Usually those irregularities will be discussed in the study if they are of consequence to the findings. There will always be allometric scaling of dosages between species.

Here are a few general conversions:

D = Animal Dose

H = Human Dose

D*K/37 = H

* Mice- D*3/37 = H
* Rats- D*6/37 = H (K value for rats will range from 6 to 7)

__________________________________________

Given that, a 100mg/kg dose given to a rat would be a 16mg/kg dose given to a human. This changes the dose from 8,100mg dose for my body weight, to a 1,300mg dose. That is a **HUGE** difference! Other larger animals weights are going to vary a lot, so the guidelines are not as accurate. Usually a study using animals of that size will mention an estimated human equivalent dose.

First off, happy new year!

I noticed that caffeine/L-theanine is the recommended starting stack according to this subreddit's FAQ, but I had a few quick questions about said pairing. My very rudimentary, layman's understanding is the caffeine (along with amphetamines) act by temporarily pushing your brain into overdrive, with the effect that prolonged use wears out your brain prematurely. Is this true? If so, does L-theanine counteract this long-term damage? If not, why is caffeine considered a nootropic; after all, one of the criteria for being a nootropic is that the substance in question should be non-toxic or have low toxicity. Caffeine on the other hand has an LD50 of ~150-200mg/kg in humans.

Lastly, has there been any research on the effects of nootropics on developing brains? I'm a university student (&lt;25 years of age) and I'm interested in experimenting with nootropics but am wary because of the dearth of information on long-term use of nootropics by young people. I've heard a lot of horror stories of folks being seriously screwed up because of Big Pharma pushing prescription pills whose effects on young minds are not properly tested and regulated, so I want to be sure that this stuff is safe for me.

Thanks a ton.",,False,,t5_2r81c,False,,,True,t3_15s09c,http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/15s09c/questions_about_ltheanine_and_caffeine/,

I used Oxiracetam for a few months but stopped because I wanted to give it a break. It helped with motivation and mood. 

I tried it again recently and found it didn't help me as much as before so I switch over to Aniracetam and wow! I bought Aniracetam 6-7 months ago, tried it once but didn't like it. Now Oxiracetam isn't helping and Aniracetam is a wonder drug? I notice depending on your state of mind one nootropic works better then others.. and I must say mentally I've changed a lot (for the good) the past couple years. 

It's amazing too -- increased focus, motivation, memory, speech, I'm more awake, more energetic and very surprising, increased libido? I haven't read about this side-effect anywhere else but it's true. 

I'm in love with Aniracetam.. for me it's like I drank a cup of coffee without any of the side-effects of coffee. By the way I had coffee with Aniracetam and I was up until late in the morning with way too much focus. I got a lot done that day but it ruined my sleep schedule for the week. I'm not doing that again. 

So again one take away I'm getting is depending on a person's state of mind.. one nootropic will work better then another?

Additionally there be some difficulty in getting 5-HTP to cross the blood brain barrier before being converted to serotonin (converting instead in the liver and thus not being useful).

So why not just take tryptophan? Am I missing something? I recognize the 5-HTP may have more noticeable effects more quickly, but say you take 5-HTP for a short period of time to initially increase serotonin levels, then increase tryptophan as you go off the 5-HTP would this not help to ramp up natural production and maintain a level slightly higher than baseline that would still have the positive benefits of increased serotonin levels while reducing the potential for negative side effects?",,False,,t5_2r81c,False,,,True,t3_10ydqv,http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/10ydqv/why_not_take_tryptophan_instead_of_5htp/,

At the age of 18, I was headed off to college, complex relationships were spiraling into summer, and I just realized the effects my actions had on other people. 

Over the course of two prescriptions, I believe I may have gone through more realizations and maturity as some go through in two years. Subtle social cues and even social dynamic were previously something foreign to me, and now I was expected to master them. The Vyvanse allowed for this to be possible by stimulating my mind and allowing me to absorb more of the world around me.

Of course, this intense brain stimulation could not be good for a previously lethargic mindset. I decided that I was going to need some nootropics to guarantee my wellbeing if I planned on staying on pharmaceutical amphetamines for a while.

For those who do not take stimulants, the effects that they have on your brain can be devastating. Imagine your brain as a muscle. When you go and work out, you are subjecting your muscles to unnatural movements in the hopes of making them stronger. Much like a work out, amphetamines stimulate the frontal lobe and absorb more information, do more work, to become 'stronger.' But like a sore muscle, my brain could not keep up with the constant stimulation. I experienced mood swings, depression, and brain fog due to the inability of my brain to keep up, especially after the medicine wore off.

So, I ordered a tub of Aniracetam powder because of its fat-solubility (meaning the effects will eventually build up and linger) and its ability to modulate the AMPA receptors, which may help combat ADHD. I was very familiar with the racetams, having taken Pramiracetam several months before, so my decision was confident. I also ordered a new choline source, Alpha GPC, which is supposed to be the most efficient choline source available on the market.

I began to dose 750mg of Aniracetam with roughly 300mg of Alpha GPC twice daily. This was adjusted to 1000mg of Aniracetam with 600mg Alpha GPC as I responded well to both supplements and I am currently taking both alongside my Vyvanse prescription.

On Aniracetam and Alpha GPC, my clarity is back. Any bit of depression and anxiety I experienced on Vyvanse (and even prior to medication) is destroyed. I am completely in control of my brain and where it will take me.

But the soothing action of the nootropics I was looking for was surpassed by their individual mechanisms.

On Aniracetam, I became extremely creative. I have always been a creative person. I write, I draw, I make music, I create ideas and write out models, sketches, etc. but nothing ever sticks. On the second day of Aniracetam, I cranked out a beautiful drawing of caliber I never knew I could accomplish. I was able to retain focus for hours and stay intrigued.

Also, whether it is due to my complete change in mindset, or the action of the supplements and medication, I notice a new synergy when I smoke weed. The Aniracetam and Alpha GPC combo seems to destroy my tolerance and make one joint feel like two or three. My 'high' now feels extremely clean and efficient and I am completely level headed and in control. No saying stupid shit, no feeling trapped inside a bubble of feeling. I feel that before, weed would make me feel stuck in my head like a stick in the mud. Now, it's as if I am jumping off a springboard into the skies.

I have also noticed an increased appreciation in the world around me. I prefer to take the 'scenic road' whether that be on my bike or on a walk due to the joy I get out of looking up into the trees or even admiring the kitchiness of the suburban houses around me.

Maybe I am looking for a better explanation:

I was born an introvert, secretly an extrovert, and now I am ready to share that secret.

For me, my stack is more than just something to 'make me smart,' its something that has changed my life and allowed me to propel deeper into this crazy experience we all share.

Take this story as a cautious success. Deeply research each supplement before you purchase and try to understand how it will effect your life. Only then will you appreciate the true power of these nootropics.

In here I discovered hole new world and I want to share my experience with it.

I wanted to start with safest and easy to get nootropic, and after some research, I decided that Piracetam will be my choice.

I tracked my results with Dual-n-Back - http://i.imgur.com/QQ2W7.png

Before using Piracetam, I had played it, but got stuck in D-3-B and couldn't make any progress, so I left it.

Every other day I'm doing simple attention trainings (like watching minutes hand).

The day I bought my Piracetam I was really excited about it and first dose made immediate effects. I felt euphoric, happy and my thoughts were really intense and deep. While I was going to work with bus, I analyzed almost every person who sat in front of me. I tried to determine their character and temperament by analyzing their faces, body and clothes. What relations they have with person who sits with them? All this stuff was going through my head and oh, boy, it has been long time since I had so interesting time with myself.

When I took 2nd dose and didn’t felt even 1/8 of the 1st doses effects, I understood, that it was placebo. One hella good placebo. 



For most of the time I used 1.2g x 2 per day. I experimented for 5 days with 1.6 x 3, but it didn't give any bigger boost. Even more, 2 out of 5 days I couldn't win D-4-B, but scored high in D-5-B.

For now I'm trying to find out what effect I will have with low doses - 0.4g x 3.

Comparing my intelligence before and after using Piracetam, I have to say that my memory and attention has increased the most (but it's still very hard for me to learn new complicated things).

I have became more talkative, cause now I can fallow subject with ease. 

There is one bad effect - I'm more arguable in a bad way. 

The progress was slow and I'm sure that without playing D-n-B and writing a diary, I wouldn't able to tell that my intelligence has increased. It is feeling so natural.  



I didn't supplement with choline and didn't have any headache.


Few days ago I found out this topic - http://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/56957-boost-iq-stack/

Guy is using so much supplements and nootropic's, but hasn't won D-5-B. I won it in day 27 with only using Piracetam. Looks like less is better.

After some research I decided to try a new, highly bioavailable form of Magnesium called Magnesium L-Threonate. The results were astonishing.

In my first two months of Piracetam use I experienced typical effects such as mental clarity, increased appreciation of music, wakefulness, synergy with caffiene, improved memory, the ability to instantly wake up clear-headed from sleep, and improved focus. From time to time I noticed increased verbal flow as well as increased visual color saturation.

In comes Magnesium L-Threonate. I wasn't expecting noticeable effects right off the bat, but that's what I got. Within two days of taking this [Magnesium supplement](http://www.amazon.com/Neuro-MagTM-Magnesium-L-Threonate-Calcium-Vitamin/dp/B006P57AFM) I noticed intense color saturation everywhere I looked. Driving to work everyday I couldn't stop staring at EVERYTHING. It's as if I'm seeing the world through an entirely new lens. The best thing I can compare it to is the first time I took shrooms 5 years ago, but more saturation.

Another effect I'm beginning to notice is increased short term and long term memory. I'm reading three different books right now and I don't have to use bookmarks anymore, I just remember the page I left. I see the page very clearly in my mind and don't see the use for a bookmark. The information I read just sticks to my brain (hard to explain). Also, I recently started working in Starbucks and in three 6 hours shifts I have almost every drink recipe memorized, as well as the other job processes required. The people I work with say that it takes most people a month before they reach my level of understanding, and that I picking up on everything extremely quickly.

As well as these benefits I've seen increased quality of deep sleep and increased vivid dreaming. Often feeling more rested when I wake, even when I'm only able to sleep for 5-6 hours.

Most of you are more knowledgable on the functions of these different chemicals. Could you post research that explains the reactions I'm having to this form of Magnesium with Piracetam/Choline?

I thought I'd briefly write up my early  experiences with the drug.

When it arrived, I was a bit concerned at first as I had trouble finding a reliable-seeming source and eventually opted for an ebay seller. The packaging was really simple (like those silver ration-pack bags) with a crappy label on it. What concerned me was that it looked like the Piracetam label had been stuck over a label that looked like it read choline. I decided to give it a shot anyway, and from the effects I've had it seems like the real deal. I believe I read somewhere that piracetam smells a bit like sherbet but tastes bitter, which is reassuring as that's what I've found. 

I have been taking it for about three days now. I do not have a reliable measuring system for small amounts of powder so I have been mixing about half a tsp of it with orange juice or water and taking that twice a day. These are the effects I've felt.

* Increased alertness/sharpness of mind. Whatever you want to call it, I feel less sluggish and more focused. I played the best I ever have on BF3 yesterday.

* Effects of things that would usually make me unmotivated/sluggish/lazy etc such as hangovers or the headrush after  the first cigarette of the day have been greatly reduced. While I can feel the effect, it's like my mind is blasting straight through it and my focus is unaffected.

* Sleep: While I am prone to night-owl sleep patterns that push later into the morning all the time, Piracetam has affected it in a different way. Whereas usually late nights are the result of being too busy on my pc playing games or on reddit, twice in a row now I have gone to bed late and still not been able to get to sleep. Perhaps I need to lower my dosage in the evening.

* On the plus side of the sleep thing, after staying up until 10am yesterday I only actually slept for about 6 hours (usually I'd clock a good 10-11 hours after staying up all night). If I can regulate my sleep patterns this could be beneficial as I do have a problem with sleeping too long.

* Motivation: this is possibly a placebo effect, but I have found I am definitely more motivated than usual. I started some work not due in for a while this morning, just because I wanted to do something constructive. I am finding myself looking for more constructive activities (usually my free time would be constituted of: Videogames, reddit and similar stuff, easy to watch comedy shows) such as Uni work or music. I have a strong drive to dust off the language software I had been using a year ago to learn German and Polish, develop my music theory on bass and spend some time on seddit. I feel like my usual impulses of chasing instant gratification has been replaced by the need to do something productive.

* Unlike my experiences with caffeine, I am not feeling any side effects of the mental energy boost. When I used caffeine to keep me focused on work and ward off sleep I find I simultaneously experience the tiredness and the twitchy energy rush. With Piracetam I've found it just makes me feel like I don't need sleep for longer.

Okay well I'm going to go do something actually productive instead of writing this now. Hope some of you find it informative!",,False,,t5_2r81c,False,,,True,t3_n62cs,http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/n62cs/my_first_experiences_with_piracetam/,

I'm excited, scared and trying terribly to fight the internal stigma of needing/wanting a pill to help sort me out.

I don't know which would help more with my symptoms, but I'm willing to try the gentler one first.

The thing that has me the most scared are the reports of better focus, but loss of creativity. I'm typically a pretty funny and occasionally artistic guy and I'm not sure I'd trade that for any GPA in the world.

1376186338.0,19,self.Nootropics,1k4el2,Experience with Rhodiola and Creatine,theonlywayforward,20,1,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/1k4el2/experience_with_rhodiola_and_creatine/,"I'm posting just to give the community some reports on my experiences with these nootropics:


I'm 18, 150 lbs, and 5'8. I exercise somewhat frequently, doing strength training 2-3x a week and doing cardio 2x a week. I sleep about 7-9 hours a night. 


I purchased Rhodiola Rosea and Creatine Monohydrate from Smartpowders.com. It arrived pretty promptly, the packaging was nice, and everything looked legit. 

I purchased Rhodiola because I was looking for a nootropic that was more stimulating after my sedating experience with Bacopa. I purchased Creatine because I wanted to see its effects on my strength training and cardio and on my weight.






My experiences thus far with both have been pretty satisfactory:


1) Rhodiola is interesting. I feel it strongly when I'm sleep deprived, in that with 5 hours of sleep (usually leaves me a bit foggy and with a slight headache) I was performing at 100%. Not stimulated, but just not fatigued. I've really come to understand that distinction with my use of Rhodiola. 


 It also helped a TON with caffeine withdrawal. Eliminated the headache I get from even minor caffeine withdrawal (a week of 100mg a day)and got rid of the fatigue and tiredness that accompanies that withdrawal. Basically made the withdrawal a lot more convenient.


On days I'm not sleep deprived or withdrawing from caffeine, its a lot more subtle. Sometimes I question whether it affects me at all when I'm not affected by outside stress. 

So for me, personally, its verdict is that I'll reserve for days where I need 100% function regardless of stress or lack of sleep. I won't make it an everyday supplement. 


As a sidenote, it seems to help me with how I feel after exercise. I'm usually pooped after cardio but I don't feel mentally exhausted after cardio anymore, which is nice. So I may reserve it for those days as well because it does get annoying to be a bit nonfunctional after exercise. 






2) Creatine was unexpectedly effective for me as a nootropic. I also turned out to be a responder to creatine in terms of muscular endurance, though I'm not sure if my weight went up or not since it fluctuates a TON anyways. 

Its mental effects were similar to Rhodiola's. I felt less tired if I had it when sleep deprived or stressed. I tried both separately and then together, and they both have this effect of bringing me back to baseline (subjectively, of course) functioning when I'm tired or stressed. 

So that was awesome :)

It also made my dreams really vivid. I've started to lucid dream somewhat frequently, which was previously pretty rare for me. My sleep if I take it before bed is I think of slightly lesser quality, so I take it right when I wake up. 

It has helped a TON with short term endurance in cardio. The first 5 minutes of my run I'm doing really fast with a lot less perceived effort and discomfort. I also recover more quickly between sprints or short runs, and I recover much more quickly between sets of strength training.


Overall, creatine has been awesome. Will put that in my daily stack for the foreseeable future. 


TL;DR

Rhodiola is great if I'm tired but otherwise is lackluster. Creatine is great all the time.

I've some pramiracetam here beside me but am reluctant to take it as I see no benefit to doing so.

I've taken it before and it did nothing (tried with choline, with fish oil tablets, without anything etc, tried capsuling it, different dosages, attack stage). Nothing. And I'm confident in myself enough to identify a placebo (asides from blind trials of course) so I wouldn't experience a placebo from it. Tried piracetam before and the same thing- nothing. 

I did drink with pramiracetam before and it wasn't good (didn't enjoy drinking as I usually would, social abilities impaired), I thank my very high tolerance for alcohol for not making that experience worse.

Is there any point in me taking it if it will either do nothing or worse, or do you have a different story to tell?

1364787463.0,19,self.Nootropics,1beew9,Has anyone tried N-acetylcysteine or N-Acetylcysteine amide?,ontodynamics,25,6,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/1beew9/has_anyone_tried_nacetylcysteine_or/,"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23538074

&gt; N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) is a precursor to the essential amino acid, cysteine. Unlike cysteine, NAC can penetrate the blood-brain barrier such that by oral supplementation, it can increase blood and brain levels of cysteine. Preclinical data, case reports, and clinical studies indicate potential benefits of NAC for the treatment of addictions, bipolar depression, schizophrenia, autism, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), tri-chotillomania, nail biting, skin picking, overdoses, and environmental toxic exposures.


&gt; NAC plays important roles in metabolic pathways believed to contribute to psychi-atric disorders:

&gt; 1. By increasing levels of brain cysteine, NAC was able to modulate glutamatergic and dopaminergic pathways. In vitro studies show a reduction in synaptic release of glutamate and an increase in dopamine release.

&gt; 2. Oxidative stress has been implicated as contributing to psychiatric disorders.

&gt; Glutathione (GSH) is the body’s main endogenous antioxidant. As a precursor to GSH, NAC has been widely used to replenish GSH, for example in the treatment of acetaminophen overdose. In addition, NAC directly scavenges reactive oxygen species.

&gt; 3. Inflammatory cytokines play a role in brain aging and psychiatric disorders. NAC has anti-inflammatory effects that may occur via antioxidant activities or other direct effects on inflammatory pathways.

&gt; Side effects and adverse reactions:

&gt; At clinically relevant doses, side effects of NAC are infrequent and generally mild.  Occasionally allergic reactions and rarely anaphylactic reactions to intravenous NAC have been reported, but these rarely led to discontinuation. Longer-term and dose-finding studies would help clarify the maximum safe doses. In animal studies very high doses caused pulmonary hypertension, but this has not been reported in human studies. Overdose of NAC was associated with seizures. However, in low doses NAC is antiepileptic.

&gt;    


Then for the amide form: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23472882

&gt; Over six decades, numerous studies involving NAC therapy have yielded inconsistent results and this could be due to low bioavailability. In order to overcome the limitations of NAC, an amide derivative N-Acetylcysteine amide (NACA) has been synthesized to improve the lipophilicity, membrane permeability and antioxidant property. Recent studies have demonstrated the blood brain barrier permeability and therapeutic potentials of NACA in neurological disorders including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Multiple sclerosis, Tardive dyskinesia and HIV associated neurological disorders. In addition, NACA displays protective effect against pulmonary inflammation and antibiotic induced apoptosis. Forthcoming research on the possible therapeutic properties of NACA and its generics in the management of pathologies associated with extracellular matrix degradation and oxidative stress-related inflammation is highly exiting. Superior bioavailability of NACA is likely to fulfill the promises of NAC as well as a molecule to improve the endurance and resident time of bioscaffolds and biomaterials.

How about health and uptake? I've read that most of the 5-HTP is metabolized to Serotonin in the gut without ever passing the BBB. And too much Serotonin can lead to heart problems. So taking a l-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor is recommended. Does EGCG work in this regard?

**My story:**
I placed an order on September 28th after seeing that it was not only a new business created by fellow Redditors, but also had by far the cheapest prices around. I saw that many people had already placed orders with them and decided to take the plunge.

I purchased 55 grams of Pramiracetam, 100 grams of Alpha GPC, and 100 grams of Aniracetam. I saw that the order shipped on October 2nd and was happily awaiting my package in the coming week. Most of you reading this now know exactly whats coming next because you're probably in the same boat. Back and forth asking for updates after a couple of weeks they said they had no idea where my package was and asked if I wanted a refund or for them to ship it out again and an additional 10% of everything. Well shit happens I thought, I'll take the extra noots for an even better deal. 

Finally about one week ago I got a tracking number and my package was on its way! I open the mailbox all ansy and see a little brown envelope. When I say little, I mean **little**. Uhhhh *opens package* Inside of a small black baggy was another small black back with a label saying ""Alpha GPC 55g"" That was a disappointment to say the least. I shot an email to Elevated labs and for the first time they actually responded quickly saying they'd ship it to me immediately. Due to the nature of the fuck-up my packages were shipped in two parts, the Alpha GPC first, followed by the rest of the order (Only a day apart) so naturally I'd get my next part the next day and I wouldn't have to worry about more Choline for a while, right? *Wrong!*

It's rounding up to the end of the (Shipping) week and even though my package was ""Shipped"" I still haven't gotten it. I received a tiny portion of a very expensive order and I'm trying to be patient ... trying. I've shipped to further places then Texas and USPS 3-5 day shipping WILL get it there in that time!

A quick history of my Noot experiences:

I got 100g of Piracetam last year, and that stuff worked extremely well for me. Everything looked sharp, bright, and alive. It kicked me out of the house better than coffee. I could remember things vividly. Conversation was effortless. Overall, I just felt smarter. My girlfriend and I both loved it! We supped with Lecithin for Choline, which seemed to work pretty well. On a side note, smoking weed on Piracetam was great! It was a much clearer high.

After 6 months or so, I heard of Noopept and decided to buy some from CerebralHealth. After trying it for weeks/months on and off, I just couldn't help but notice negative effects. Almost nothing reminded me of what Piracetam did for me. Noopept usually makes me feel stupid, foggy, and tired. I took Noopept twice today, and I couldn't even handle talking to the cashier at the gas station. I had trouble speaking, making eye contact, paying her etc. My girlfriend isn't exactly singing about it, either. She thinks it makes her sharper, but I digress. On a side note, smoking weed on Noopept seems to bring out the stupidity moreso, and seems to diminish Noopept's effects.

One strange thing about Noopept is, I can feel it working the entire time. I can feel my brain being ""tickled"" by it. A faint buzzing feeling. It isn't exactly a pleasant feeling, overall. 

I'd also like to point out that any more than half of a small coffee taken too close to Noopept makes me feel very anxious and overstimulated, even with Theanine.

I wonder if it's just the vendor, but I don't think Noopept is worth it for me. I think I'll order Piracetam and some Choline for the future, as it's pretty cheap and is more studied.

I quite literally felt like I was floating outside of myself, and it was very much like a dream - I kept having to remind myself that if people asked me questions then I needed to answer, that it wasn't a dream.  It was taking me minutes to remember things that I'd done only a few days before.  One thing occurred to me, I had also had a reasonable sized coffee at the same time as I took my 'noots' (coffee being an automatic morning ritual).

The effect eventually started wearing off around 7-8 hours later, thank God, and I feel a lot more normal now, although still a bit 'wired'.

So I would like some advice, both on my stack and what I experienced.  I'm obviously not going to take the nootropics tomorrow, and definitely reduce my dosage if I do try them again.

Thanks for your help!

UPDATE:  I experimented with another pyritinol again today, but with no coffee or other chemicals, and I had exactly the same symptoms as before. Clearly it doesn't like me. Also, there was some evidence of a rash on my face. Finally, I went to the bathroom and my piss was red hot - I think it might be inducing hyperthermia, which would explain the crazily dry mouth and general dizzyness.

I've known about piracetam and I have taken it on and off over the last 11-12 years or so.  I'm now about 35, and I'm finding I am having problems with:
* depression (mild to medium)
* focus and concentration - I get overwhelmed by the sheer complexity of what I have to do (write database software)
* procrastination from the overwhelmedness
* possibly learned helplessness

I think a lot of this is depression induced.  I think I have a ""depressive brain"", but I have had a few trigger events in the last 3 years, starting with hearing damage to one ear (I was an avid music listener/hifi).  Combined with nearly getting fired from a company, and a bunch of other things I have had a lot of challenges.  It is a nasty feedback loop.

I've been taking 5htp for a few months now.  I find it takes about 1 week to build up and it can really help the mood.  It somewhat helps with focus, but its not bullet proof there.  I have been taking provigil during the week, and it KIND of works, but it isnt busting thru strongly.  It works better than caffine, but it isnt giving me a lot in the motivation/focus/etc area.

A week ago I started taking 3.2g of piracetam a day, and I cut out the provigil entirely.  It took a few days, but all of a sudden I am getting a lot more of the ""old me"" back.  The ability to think complex interwoven thoughts without feeling overwhelmed, without feeling like I'm a loser who is also a failure at my chosen career.  It is pretty amazing - a major improvement.  Before just thinking of writing code feels so hard that I want to avoid it.  Now instead I have written more code in 3 days than the previous 2 months!  It's really scary how bad things have gotten.

I just wanted to say that I hadn't kept at the piracetam in the past because I felt like it wasnt really helping me.  But I'm obviously going to stay on it this time.  I've ordered 1kg bulk and it should be here soon!  I also ordered some noopept just for kicks as well.

This is mostly my experience, but here are a few questions:

- I am taking Choline Bitartrate (from GNC i know but I needed a fast local source), at 250mg a day.  No headaches so far.  Should I consider switching? I have heard that overdosing choline can contribute to depression, so I want to avoid that.
- I am taking 3.2g piracetam a day.  This could be considered an attack dose.  Should I up or diminish the dose after a week?
- Provigil can be helpful for awakefulness, can I combine?  Or not worth it?
- Is is possible/wise to mix in noopept with piracetam?  With provigil? All 3?

Thanks all, and to those who are having the problems I was having, fear not, there is hope! ",,False,,t5_2r81c,False,,,True,t3_108dli,http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/108dli/provigil_and_piracetam_experience/,

I was just looking for some advice on which nootropics offer the best high energy returns with focus being a second desirable feature. I've just found out that, due to a ""promotion"", I'm going to start getting hit with 60 hour weeks of more intensive work starting from next week. I won't have time to find my balance with racetams and choline supplements, particularly as I can't expect delivery of such before I start so I just need help finding something suitable to get me used to the initial workload. The work is in biotech so I need to remain somewhat focussed too and it can't be anything that would throw up red flags during a drug test. Here are my current thoughts:

* Synthetic B-vitamins. For starters I was thinking of these which have a superior profile for passing the blood brain barrier such as salbutiamine which I had good albeit fleeting benefits from.


* Rhodiola Rosea for stress alleviation and energy if I can get the dosage right.


* Theanine and caffeine for stress alleviation and energy. 


* Phosphatidylserine reduce cortisol levels and possibly increase energy levels.


* Centella asiatica, aid immune system, improve concentration, stress reduction.


* Also, while I'm not a smoker, I was considering chewing nicotine gum while out of the lab. 


* Ginkgo biloba. Improves concentration even if tolerance develops rapidly.


* Acetlycarnitine and Alpha-lipoc acid improve comprehension and general cognition, although the later was in those with mild  cognitive impairments.


* Phenylalanine with adequate B3, B6, Cu and Fe from multivitamin. Would it be better to take tyrosine or both?


* ALCAR: I have some but every time I take it I get pretty bad headaches so choline supplementation is probably not for me. Possibly because of my love of eggs.


* Lion's mane. More of a long term supplement improving brain function through apparently stimulating nerve growth factor and myelination. 


* Ginseng. There seems to be a variety of these, each with their own set of supporters but I'll probably try Siberian. 


Any suggestions or advice is greatly welcomed. Also, there are probably several interactions going on here that I haven't considered so let me know if you see anything. ",,False,,t5_2r81c,1344336744.0,,,True,t3_xtg1o,http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/xtg1o/high_energy_nootropics/,

Then there are others that claim that nootropics follow a u shaped dosage curve, with the optimum dose being in the middle. Too much or too little, and it's not very effective, and that we should start with a low dose and increase until we ""feel the effects"".

So what if we don't feel the effects of a certain nootropic at all? Perhaps it is too subtle to notice at any given dose. Perhaps our day to day experiences don't enable us to accurately gauge whether it is the nootropic or what we ate that day, our mood, how much we've slept, etc.

So in general, how do we go about determining nootropic dosing?  I personally think it's best to look at the scientific studies, and follow those dosing recommendations. I have only seen one study addressing the ""u shaped curve"", and it said the observation was only seen in rats, and this was only for one specific nootropic. But what do I know?

1329344382.0,17,self.Nootropics,prc9p,Experiment - Modafinil while performing extended physical and mental activity (Dirtbike / Enduro riding),,19,2,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/prc9p/experiment_modafinil_while_performing_extended/,"Hey guys!

I often go riding a dirtbike out in some pretty extreme terrain, around some small mountains in Australia. After battling a heavy off road motorbike that weighs over 100kg throughout the day in the hot Australian sun, physical and mental fatigue hits in. I generally pack alot of food with me - Protein shakes, nut bars and high sugar content lollies. 
 
After about an hour of riding, the mind goes into a state of flow - It's almost like you become 'one' with the machine. Things happen to quick to think - You just exist in the moment. The perception of time shifts as the adrenaline flows. The brilliant moment fades away as the physical toll comes on. I start to get a foggy mind; my reaction times slow down and i'm more prone to making a mistake which could result in coming off the bike and having an accident. 

Enter Modafinil. 200mg. 

At first nothing different is noticed. I've entered that familiar state of flow. The peak experience. Trees race past, the bike slides under the dirt as it corners through rough terrain. I stop for a break and look at the clock. Three hours have passed. At some point I had forgotten the fact that I took Modafinil today. The body is sore; a reminder that I need to keep fit.. and a reminder that I will need to slow down as the mental haze kicks in. But this doesnt happen. Throughout the day I continue at the same pace; observing potential hazards in the distance which scanning the immediate terrain as the bike accelerates to 80km/s blasting up hill that seems almost vertical.  That's when I realise the Modafinil is showing it's grace. It's as if the mind is immune to the typical mental fatigue brought on by extended physical activity.  The sharpness never fades.. As a result I believe this reduces the risk of having an accident from zoning out and missing critical information that the brain has to take notice of very quickly due simply riding so fast. 

I can certainly see this Nootropic's place in sport when long term endurance is required. The only downfall is when calling it in at night, my body was aching but the mind was still active; it didn't want to sleep so an internal battle seems to go on here.

Anyway I thought I would share this experience. I'm new to Modafinil as I've only taken in a few times in different senarios for experimentation. The last time was arriving off a 12 hour night time flight (with minimum sleep) and going straight to work from the airport to fix some critical software bugs. I was able to think clearly but still felt like absolute crap. Similar to the the riding experience described,  it's like the disconnect with the mind and body becomes more apparent in situations with physical stress.

i bought pre-pilled piracetam+choline supplement (390mg Pira / 156mg Choline). started with an attack dose of 6 pills (2340mg Pira / 936mg choline) on the first and second day. continually took 2 more pills occasionally for about a month. i only had 30 pills.

i really didn't notice the effects for quite a while and i was aware that it is a very subtle drug. about a week ago, i noticed that i've been able to process information and respond a lot quicker. my responses have also become a lot more... witty/intelligent. i started to actively look for ways to stimulate my mind. i'm subscribed to DepthHub and AskScience, but never really browsed them. now, those are the only two subreddits i look at.

unfortunately, i'm out of school currently so i can't really give any empirical evidence through grades, only anecdotal.

one side effect that my friend pointed out is that i've become a lot more neurotic. the velocity at which thoughts are playing out in my head is a little unbelievable. i think way too damn much. i over-analyze EVERYTHING. keep in mind, i've always been like this but it has increased almost tenfold. i'm assuming it's because i'm not used to this increased brain activity?

My current stack is taken twice a day:


MultiV

I am running through my back-to-school task list.

I should tell everyone i did feel some mood, memory, sleep, and slight focus improvements before adding DMAE and lecithin. The difference after adding them however, is significant.

I've heard the benefits build up over weeks, so i am excited to see where i stand in a couple of weeks.

Entries probably will just be short and sweet, with anything that's noteworthy.  More detailed assessments can be made if anyone has ideas.  Dual-N-Back seems like the obvious choice, maybe Sudoku solve times as well?

Background:
I'm a college student who's experienced a certain mental dullness in recent months, despite best efforts to have a 'healthy lifestyle' (plenty of sleep, exercise, good food, time for hobbies).  I even ceased my anxiety med to hopefully to live healthy and sober.  None of that helped.

I've suffered from depression in the past, but I doubt that is the problem as I feel nowhere close to those feelings anymore.  Additionally, this past year has been very good in most areas of my life.  After much reflection, I believe my anxiety causes me to freeze and dither, while my treatment has left me lethargic (but happier).  Overall, I'd say I'm better with treatment, but I need an option that will manage anxiety without sedation.  

I have a small amount of experience with Nootropics from a few years ago, Piracetam, Picamillon, and Hydergine.  All of those left me wanting, so I gave up on them.  I have used various non-traditional Noots for Noot purposes, but mostly caffeine is my mainstay.

Enter Noopept.  From all the reviews I've read, even by those who had adverse effects (irritability mostly), it works, simply, and quickly.  My only concerns are sexual side effects that some have reported and are an issue with nefiracetam.

I purchased 10g from CerebralHealth.  The Noopept came in a ziploc baggie inside of a sealed foil pouch.  I am not impressed by the packaging.  I may go with another vendor in the future.

The powder is very clumpy and smells like a dull mushroom musk.  The taste is not puke-worthy, but at least gag-worthy.  I am working on a liquid suspension that will mask the taste and make dosing easier.

Day 1:  
Yesterday evening, I took out a small scoop that roughly equates to 10mg visually of other powders.  (Yes, this is bad practice.)  I let it sit under my tongue for 5-10 minutes then washed it down with my vitamins.  Hard to tell if there was a real effect, but I did feel more relaxed and happier.  I was also better able to recall information than normal, but we'll see how that plays out.

Day 2:  
I took a scoop (roughly twice the size of previous) on an empty stomach this morning.  Again, hard to tell if it's making an impact just yet.  A conversation with my advisor was more fluid than usual, but Differential Equations is still not making lots of sense.  We'll see.

I took another dose similar to morning dose about 15 minutes ago.  washed it down with chocolate syrup and water.  That worked well. 

Oh, probably worth noting is that I drank about half as much coffee as I normally do.  I will say I think that Noopept potentiated the effect of the caffeine, which others have reported.  Also, for some reason they were giving out 5-hour Energy on campus today.  I saved it to stack with Noopept sometime.

At least in regards to these three (which I have seen referred to as 'Class 1' racetams) almost every study that I come across mentions in the full text (either in the discussion or the introduction) that they are 'virtually non-toxic' compounds and very safe to use. Nobody is citing shit.

I'm doing reviews for Examine.com at the moment, and the actual primary citation to these toxicity claims would be *really* helpful. But doing searches for these racetams and the keywords of 'toxicity', 'LD50' and the like only brings me studies showing how racetams alleviate excitotoxicity via AMPA modulation.

So, does anybody know where I can find the actual toxicology/safety studies conducted on these compounds, or at least studies mentioning them directly (as, since these are pharmaceuticals, that data might not be published? Or perhaps the fact that lots of Piracetam articles are in Russian and not logged in Pubmed?)

About the same 6 hour duration too. Shame it's completely unresearched, but having used it 6/7 days last week there seem to be no noticeable aftereffects, which is always a good sign.

Have used between 30-70mg/day in the last week, and have settled on 35mg +15mg as great for 5+ hours of solid theory work, followed by 3-4 hours of still increased attentiveness. 

35mg typically comes up within 20-30 minutes, providing an ideal level of stimulation until t+2, after which it begins to tail off, the effects are not particularly noticeable after t+4 but effects do seem to remain until around t+6. Taking after a large meal seems to reduce the effect by about 25% but doubled the effective time, removing the need to redose.

Redosing twice (35+20+15 and 25+15+20) seems to cause stomach discomfort resembling trapped air. Neither MJ or anything else seems to shake it, but it is relatively minor.

They then go on to reference this study by Chung in which 40% oxygen breathers improved accuracy scores in an addition task. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18569150 Chung also has studies using 30% oxygen on pubmed.

Oxygen has also been shown to improve memory for shopping lists and faces (Winder and Borrill, 1998).

The suggested dosing is 30 seconds to 3 minutes. This will increase blood oxygen for 4-5 minutes.

However, the positive benefits described in the study above can arguably be offset by the potential risk that 


&gt;[the functional responses to acute stimulation with BDNF, NT-3 and NT-4/5, including c-Fos induction and phosphorylation of Trk and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) proteins, were significantly decreased after 6 days in culture by prior exposure to BDNF ... there was a parallel down-regulation of TrkB protein as well as of trkB and trkC mRNA levels in BDNF-pretreated cultures.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8752592)

I took noopept yesterday so I have not 'cleaned out' my system I guess, but other than replacing noopept with Sunifiram, everything remained the same.   I ingested 6mg at 10.30am and I took another dose of 11mg sub-lingual at 3.30pm.  I didn't notice anything terribly remarkable, in the morning I think I experienced a mild stimulation not unlike caffeine, perhaps a little bit cleaner, it didn't feel like piracetam, sensations remained the same, but I did find myself enjoying music on my headphones, I did take care of a few chores this morning and worked out, perhaps there was a little bit of drive there... I noticed a slight elevation in body temperature and was actually sweating slightly, just from the chores... the second dose I have to say I didn't notice anything at all.   Somewhat disappointed, I think it's a fairly boring substance (*compared to more immediate stimulants &amp; other TAMs), perhaps it may be interesting in combination or from sustained use over time... will follow up if I have any more info. Here is my daily supplements list:

300mg Meclofenoxate (Centrophenoxine), 420mg Phosphatidylcholine, 5000iu Vitamin D, 10mg Loratadine (Claritin), 40mg Green Tea Extract, 200mg Resveratrol, 100mg Ubiquinol, 400mg Phospholipids (Fish Oils), 500mg Curcumin, 2300mg Glucosamine / Chondroitin


UPDATE 3/30/2013:

I obviously don't want to spend money on a useless powder, but I understand I cannot evaluate the compound's effect on myself.

I'm having great success with my piracetam stack. It's worked wonders for numerous reasons and overall it's going very well. My questions are for a close family member.

Summarizing as best as I can, my mother has had numerous illnesses alongside PTSD, requiring all sorts of poking, prodding, tests and psychiatric help as well as being prescribed a cocktail of medication. She has flown off the handle for a bit and had a breakdown for the past 4 or so years - being emotionally unstable, unwillingness to 'seize the day' with a preference to staying in bed and sleeping. As.well as all this, she's also been diagnosed with Fibromyalgia. 

Doctors are at a point where they are unwilling to help, with her having 'Alcohol dependency syndrome' added to her ever growing list of symptoms and ailments and has in the past self medicated on various benzodiazepams. If how I understand it is correct, I honestly don't blame her taking whatever course of action she deems fit to have a relief from pain the level of pain Fibromyalgia can give.

I can give more of a back-story if necessary but that's the basis of my reasoning for asking for help. She has contacted me recently after a couple of motivational speeches given by me, basically explaining she wants to get her life back on track, come off all of the medications (because hey, alot of them are only really masking the symptoms instead of treating them), and start recovering instead of hiding away. This is fantastic news, I can tell she means it. 

She's come over today after not seeing her in a while and I've shown her the magic of piracetam, what it's done for me, what its used for - other benefits etc etc. I also gave her some in a jar to take home so she can get started right away.

However, before she starts taking anything and talking to her General Practitioner about tapering off the medication - I want to know whether their are any dangerous interactions with her current medication and piracetam. A preliminary scan of the inter-webs doesn't seem to bring up anything major, however I would love to have this communities input particularly. To reiterate, she will be talking to her doctor as well, but I'm theorizing he will only roll his eyes and imply she is rejecting help. 

Her current list of medications are as follows: Ramipril (5mg a day), Amitryptyline (30mg a day), Pregabalin (600mg a day), Tramadol (400mg per day), Zopiclone (15mg a day), aswell as Hormone Replacement Therapy. 

**EDIT**: Also Fluoxetine was mentioned as she boarded the train - Dose wasn't mentioned.

Obviously some of these may require a tapering off, but this will be discussed with her GP.

**UPDATE**: The Fibromyalgia 'diagnosis' was never confirmed. I'm pretty sure the stress of being bounced from doctor to doctor (some of which have been dismissive, one time throwing a high blood pressure reading in the bin) would stop with a bit more relaxation and less worry. Some of her symptoms include difficulty with words and speaking, occasional (Maybe due to not being out the house to socialize often in 4 years) and pains down one side of body which vary in degree and intensity (according to her this is muscle tension). 

I speculate that GPs have prescribed these things to mask issues and have given up serious treatment 'because of her history', referring to the alcohol abuse. I don't know. I'm not sure about alot of things but a noot regimen holds alot of promise with it's 'regenerative' properties.

She has 35 years experience in a medical field with the last 10 being a midwife and she seemed to show great excitement after I had explained piracetam to her.

Any serious advice and I would be most grateful, I would like to see my mother in full working order again ;D

**6 HOUR UPDATE**: Thanks for the comments everyone, it really helps. She's going to consult doctors on this Tomorrow.
In the meantime, there must be alternatives to these strong medications - things like theanine can lower BP, magnesium for muscle tension, maybe even meditation for thought order and anxiety.

I am a male redditor who is very interested in various ways of achieving cognitive enhancement. Neuroscience is a topic very close to me. I have another account, but I decided to use a new one, because I'm going to utilise this one for a very different purpose. 

I have noticed people having trouble getting their nootropics in europe. They have to import theirs from the US or UK. Two of the online nootropics stores in The Netherlands have stopped their business and I thought: Why don't I jump into this game?

I will buy a domain and start up a webshop selling nootropics at steep prices. Now, I am not here trying to advertise to you, but I do want to hear if there is any demand for a Netherlands' based nootropics webshop.

I was thinking I would start by offering a very small selection of nootropics, and if business is going allright I might expand my selection. As a starting point, I thought of something along the lines of this:

* Piracetam 100 gr.
* Piracetam 500 gr.
* Choline Bitartate 50 gr. 
* Choline Bitartate 100 gr.
* Choline Bitartate 500 gr

Now I was thinking this might be a little bit of a plain selection. What would you guys add to this? My idea would be including Acetyl L-Carnitine, L-Theanine and/or maybe some other -racetam, perhaps ani- or oxi-. I might do that right away, but I might just wait until I have earned back my startup capital. What would you people do? Add more directly or wait until the store starts to take off?

I do not want to make this into a huge operation. I am in college and can only work late afternoons and evenings. I want to keep it a small scale store, but I do want to make some money off of it. This post exists to check for demand. A little publicity is nice too, but I mostly want to get ideas.

The link to it is http://www.cambridgebrainsciences.co.uk/


Similar in concept to Lumosity though, after having used (and paid for) Lumosity, I honestly prefer this resource (which is free). It's stated goal is to ""provide a freely available web-based platform for members of the public and the wider scientific community to assess their cognitive function using rigorously tested and scientifically proven tests of memory, attention, reasoning and planning"" and it comes with the Cambridge pedigree.  It shows you the bell curve of score distributions after taking each test AND keeps track of your scores over time, even including a line of best fit with the date /your scores plotted on the x and y axes respectively. 

I have found this to be very helpful for somewhat scientifically measuring the efficacy of my Nootropic supplements. After some experimentation, I discovered that my optimal stack of Nootropics consists of Pramiracetam, Sulbutiamine, Alpha GPC, and Pyritinol (with fish oil and multivitamin as well). This tool allows me to visually see/keep track of my cognitive improvement as a result of this Nootropic stack. For a sample readout of a test (and to get a bit clearer picture of what I mean) click here:http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/831/26901643538872984511017.jpg/


Some other tools I have been utilizing include typing speed tests, like that at http://www.typeonline.co.uk/typingspeed.php, and dual-n-back tests (I like http://www.soakyourhead.com/ in particular).


Anecdotally, my cognitive faculties have increased across the board as a result of my Nootropic use. Typing speed WPM has increased from 95 to 120ish over the past 3 weeks and my scores on Cambridge Brain Sciences/Dual-n-Back have increased substantially across the board. Familiarity bias from playing the games daily? I'm sure that's a part of it, though I have been noticing improvements in my day-to-day life as well (more articulate speech, improved memory, etc.) so I am inclined to believe that the Nootropics are playing a large part in this as well.


As an aside, my upstart Nootropic and Nootropic Blend company (www.elevatedlabs.com) is running a promotion that incorporates some of these tests (beat X score, win X). For details, check out our Facebook page.

Choline acetyltransferase (CAT) is markedly reduced in the brains of Alzheimer's patients.

CAT is far from saturated under normal circumstances, the functional relevance of these decreases in Alzheimer' s  disease  has been questioned. Acetylcholine synthesis in biopsy samples from Alzheimer's patients, however, has been reported to be less.

Alzheimers’s patients and age-matched controls revealed a severe loss of neurons in the nucleus 
basalis of Meynert (located within the substantia innominata). This brain area is thought to provide the primary cholinergic input to the cortical mantle.

Sodium-dependent, high-affinity choline uptake has been reported to be decreased approximately 20 percent under basal conditions in the hippocampus of aged rats. Under conditions of potassium stimulation, however, choline uptake did not differ in young and aged hippocampus. Further, no age-related differences were observed in either choline or acetylcholine levels. These results suggest a decrease in  the  activity  of septo-hippocampal cholinergic neurons.

Alterations in the cholinergic system do not occur with Alzheimer's disease to any further extent than that which occurs with natural aging.

Results from these animal studies (rodent) seem reasonably consistent; of the six reports that have been published, all but one reported age-related decreases (20 to 50 percent) in the density of muscarinic receptors with no change in affinity.

Single-cell recordings revealed that both acetylcholine and glutamic acid iontophoretically applied stimulated pyramidal cell firing rate in proportion to ejection current. However, aged brains became significantly less sensitive to acetylcholine but not to glutamic acid, whereas gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) inhibited firing in aged cells slightly more.

The primary pharmacological data supporting an important cholinergic involvement in this deficit is that blockade of  central muscarinic receptors induce a deficit in young subjects which is qualitatively similar to that occurring naturally in  aged  subjects.

Studies demonstrated that the deficit produced by scopolamine can be partially, but reliably, reduced by the anticholinesterase physostigmine in both humans and monkeys. Similar beneficial effects were not observed with the CNS stimulants methylphenidate or amphetamine. Similar deficits have not been observed with analogous pharmacological blockade of dopamine or beta-adrenergic receptors.

Cell loss in the locus coeruleus with normal aging and subgroups of senile patients supports this possibility. Given that the locus coeruleus provides a major norepinephrine input to the cortex and has independently been associated with performance of learned tasks in rodents.

A number of in vitro studies indicate that under certain conditions, increases in brain choline (or lecithin, a normal dietary source of choline) can induce a concomitant increase in the synthesis (and presumably release) of  acetylcholine. Of the 17 studies of either choline or lecithin, only one claims substantial improvement (about 60 percent of patients tested). Ten did not obtain facilitative effects on the cognitive tasks. Although some investigators claim that positive trends seemed to  exist  in some small subpopulation of  the  subjects, the effects of the precursors are far from impressive, particularly in  well-controlled, double-blind studies.

Studies with physostigmine in aged subjects have also demonstrated reliable facilitation of performance on memory tasks.  Contrary to the effects of physostigmine in young subjects, however, the optimal acute dose seems to vary dramatically among individual aged subjects.

The muscarinic agonist arecoline has been evaluated for effects on performance in memory tasks. After receiving a single injection of arecoline young adult volunteers exhibited significant improvement in ability to recall recently learned verbal material.

Arecoline improved short term memory in Alzheimer’s patients as well as monkeys. In the monkey study, direct comparisons revealed that the effects of arecoline were more robust and less variable than when the same monkeys were tested under either physostigmine or choline.

Choline has weak muscarinic agonist effects.

Cholinergic dysfunction that contributes to the age-related memory deficit may prevent choline from being effectively converted into acetylcholine in the aged brain. This may be even more true in Alzheimer's disease, where the majority of cholinergic neurons projecting to the cortex (and possibly hippocampus) may be lost, and therefore the machinery to incorporate extra precursor into acetylcholine is no longer intact. Even in the normal aging brain, however, serious deficiencies could impair conversion of plasma choline to intraneuronal acetylcholine.

Choline uptake, choline acetyltransferase activity and oxidative metabolism have all been reported to be decreased in the brains of aged and demented subjects.

Decreases in glucose utilization and oxidative metabolism may decrease the ability of the aged brain to synthesize acetyl  CoA,  thus making its availability a rate-limiting factor in acetylcholine synthesis in the aged brain.

[13 month old] mice were trained on a single-trial passive avoidance task and tested for retention either 24 hours or 120 hours later. Their performance was compared with that of mice of various ages that were maintained on a control diet.  Two salient findings were  observed: (i) a  dramatic decrease in  retention of  the  task  was observed  in  the  senescent  mice  (23 months and older) and (ii) marked differences occurred between the choline-deficient  and  choline-enriched groups (13 months old). The choline-enriched mice performed as well as 3-month-old mice, whereas the choline-deficient mice performed as poorly as the senescent mice. Choline has many important functions in the nervous system, including roles in phospholipid metabolism.  Thus, more general changes in neuronal membranes (or their functions) could have contributed to the deficits

Choline converts into acetylcholine more readily under conditions of increased neuronal activity. Activity of certain cholinergic pathways may be reduced in aged subjects. Although normal cholinergic activity depends on intact oxidative metabolism, several parameters that  reflect energy production are  decreased in  the  aged CNS. These factors could contribute to a situation in the aged brain that would prohibit extra choline from being effectively utilized.

Several lines of pharmacological evidence indicate that piracetam enables the CNS  to  function more  effectively under hypoxic conditions and improves performance in oxygen-deprived or aged animals. Neurochemical determinations suggest piracetam may facilitate conversion of adenosine diphosphate to adenosine triphosphate. Other tests indicate that piracetam also enhances intercerebral neuronal activity and may deplete hippocampal tissue acetylcholine levels, presumably by increasing release.
Fischer 344 rats administered saline, choline, piracetam, or combinations of each for 1 week; retention of a one-trial passive avoidance task was measured. Aged Fisher 344 rats had previously been shown to suffer severe impairments on this task as a natural consequence of aging. Further, evaluations of performance after various retention intervals demonstrated that the performance of the aged rats was comparable to that of young rats when tested within a hour after training, but decreased sharply, exhibiting severe deficits within 4 hours after training. The scores of those rats administered only choline did not differ from those of control rats given saline. Although the rats administered piracetam were improved subtly over the saline and choline groups, the retention scores of rats administered the choline-piracetam mixture were several times as high as those of  rats  given  piracetam alone.
Increased choline availability in aged animals may be greatly enhanced by the simultaneous administration of a pharmacological agent purported to enhance oxidative metabolism [piracetam].

Clinical trial based on these preliminary animal data found significant improvement in three of ten mild to moderate Alzheimer' s  patients treated for  1 week with combined choline and piracetam and all three responders exhibited unusually high  choline  levels  in  red blood cells (but not plasma) relative to nonresponders.

Preliminary neurochemical assays performed on the brains from the behaviorally tested animals revealed modest regionally specific changes in choline and acetylcholine with the combination, the most interesting of which occurred in the hippocampus. Whether these subtle changes were responsible for the more robust behavioral effects remains to be determined.

Preliminary data from aged rats suggest that solutions to this problem [age related memory loss] may not be simple, for different physiological functions may have to be affected; alterations may be necessary at more than one point in the cholinergic or other metabolic pathway, or alternatively, the balance or tone between two or more neurotransmitter systems may need to be improved.

No word yet on the dosage, though it would seem reasonable to assume they will be pretty conservative, like all of the ingredients in Alpha Brain so far.

Their statement

""After listening to all of your feedback, examining the latest research, and undergoing large scale field testing, we have recently added three powerful new ingredients to our flagship Alpha Brain® formula: L-theanine, L-tyrosine, and Phosphatidylserine. During the change-over we will still have the classic Alpha Brain® formula available in 90ct jars, and it will be designated as ""Classic."" All package deals will include the new formula, and may have 3 (30ct) bottles substituted for 1 (90ct) jar until the new formula is available in jars.


We are extremely excited to introduce Phosphatidylserine (PS), as it is one of the most sought after and expensive nootropic ingredients in the world. A well known cognitive enhancer that is widely used to improve both focus and memory, PS has even been shown in double blind clinical trial to improve the accuracy of golf balls driven from the tee. In the human body, phosphatidylserine is found as part of the cell membrane of cells, most notably found in the cell membrane of neurons. Our PS is sourced sustainably and ethically from soy.
L-tyrosine has replaced Mucuna Pruriens as a precursor to the production of L-dopa. With an impeccable safety profile and powerful efficacy, L-tyrosine has been a highly sought after amino acid for those looking to boost brain function. For more information on L-tyrosine, click here.


L-theanine is one of the major reasons why green tea is much smoother than any other caffeinated beverage. Closely related to the GABA mechanism and easily absorbed by the body, L-theanine can help the body provide that calm sense of balance while not interfering with the stimulating buzz of firing up your neurotransmitters. For more information on L-theanine, click here.


To further make room for our all-star ingredients, we have increased the potency of our Bacopa, Oat Straw, and GPC.


I would like to personally thank all of our tens of thousands of amazing customers for their feedback over the last year that has allowed us to perfect this revolutionary flagship formula.

The stack that worked for me. comments/suggestions welcome. ,Toppguy,18,3,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/r4loo/turning_academic_work_into_entertainment_the/,"I researched and wrote a very eloquent paper today taking 3 sources from different medias and evaluating the arguments in each one to make a clear and coherent report on the Current day depictions of masculinity in media and its lasting effects on American Culture. I did this very fast, and very efficiently. Here is what I took before doing it and why I took what I did.

(I do beleive the Trimethylglycine aided the focus from the stimulants by modulating serotonin levels, and making the current task that I was working on ""fun"" seriously the paper was really freakin' a blast to write. I attacked it with a vigor similar to the way a young kid enjoys unlocking acheivements on Call of Duty)


* 1500mg Hawthorne berry (to combat vasoconstriction brought upon by ephedrine) -move aside l-arginine, this works amazingly well (and cheap!) --HIGHLY RECOMMEND

* 25mg Ephedrine 

* 200mg caffeine

* 81mg aspirin (cheap insurance against circulatory stress)
 
* 300mg adrafinil (metabolizes into ~100mg modafinil in the body- used for speed reading) 

* 3g piracetam (to help verbal memory and writing eloquence while typing paper) 

* 1.5g trimethylglycine (improve liver function under stress and to help methylation of serotonin) 

* 2g piracetam in a tall glass of water and ""sipped on"" during the two hour process. to replace the pira lost from the diuretic effect of caffeine. 


I could NOT sit down at my computer before taking the ECA stack. I would much rather take an doctor prescribed dose of an appropriate ADHD medication that would have less cardiovascular stress associated with it - that would be much less... deadly. 

Without piracetam it is difficult to execute the instructions of the assignment in a logical manner, and the action of constructing paragraphs is a very disorganized process. Much like throwing darts at water balloons filled with paint and splattering ideas onto the canvas instead of using a paint brush and carefully distinguishing what color goes where. In both metaphors all the ideas (colors) are present; however the later example allows the audience to spectate with ease and even enthusiasm, whereas the disorganized work leads to confusion and a lack of understanding. 

Without the adrafinil, the CNS stimulation (from both Ephedrine and Caffeine) can lead to a self-sabotaging effect. As both components continue to rise in the bloodstream over time, the motivation to “get things done” increases and while reading and evaluating a research paper may be on the list of things to do, cleaning ones room may take priority in the event that too much stimulation causes a diminishing return on academic priority. Modifinil is not a stimulant, but in the simplest terms it enhances any process in which the brain is currently working on. So if an individual is reading, the process of reading is greatly aided. Ten pages fly by without so much as even one intrusive, distracting thought. So it helped me research the sources I used to write the paper.

Trimethylglycine is taken mainly to increase the power of piracetam (a self-discovery I am proud of) and also aids in the production of acetylcholine in the body which is an important chemical used in the brain for many functions including memory. In addition trimethylglycine improves liver function which is a nice benefit to have when dumping the amount of drugs/supplements into my body –the most liver-stressing one being adrafinil. 

In conclusion the cumulative “stack” I used to write a paper was pretty successful, however the stimulatory compounds (ephedrine and caffeine) can only be used once a week at most-IME, for the body builds a resistance to these drugs very quickly and the psychostimulant effect wears off leaving mainly the physiological ones, which are mainly: bronchodilation, diuretic effects, appetite suppression, and vasoconstriction. 

My poor performance is most likely (99% chance) the result of bad habits during high school and would best be corrected by behavioral change rather than drug and supplementation treatment. However at this current period in the academic there is no time to “learn” how to study and perform and prioritize academic tasks as my scholarships require a yearly cumulative GPA of 3.0 and 3.25 respectively. I have no room for failure or even sub-excellence this semester. This is why I have undergone the supplementation above. There is however a Brightside which is the simple ability to LEARN and memorize what this mental supplementation feels like - Taken as a learning experience, I can remember what things I did and how I did them and incorporate that as a characteristic of my own, which is quite completely a behavioral change.

400mcg is definitely great to ""boost"" your day for example for exams or something, but I wouldn't suggest to take it for more than a few days.

Instead of slinging around ""look at the shrinking testicals man!"" statements, I've compiled the relevant papers and provided a quick summary.

I'll leave evaluation of safety up to the discretion of the reader.  This is simply an objective summary of what has been reported in the literature.

Human Equivalent Doses are decided using a 5'8"", 150lb individual as calculated using this tool: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/onctools/animalquery.cfm



**Jindo et al, 1994**

&gt;Thirteen week toxicity study on rats, doses 30, 120 and 480 mg/kg/d.  Hypertrophy of liver hepatocytes and increased weight of the total tissue, seen in both 120 and 480mg/kg doses.  480mg/kg dose also showed salivation, prone position, increased water consumption and increased levels of serum proteins associated with toxicity.  

&gt;Study concluded 30mg/kg was the non-toxic dose under the given experimental conditions.  30mg/kg/d in rats is equivalent to 1.95 grams in humans

**Hooks et al, 1994**

&gt;52 week study in dogs, doses 0, 10, 30 and 90 mg/kg/d.  Systemic toxicity were not apparent until the second half of the study.  In the 90mg/kg dosage, these included higher urea nitrogen and creatine, higher urinary volumes with lower specific gravity/osmolarity/protein.  Histology examination showed changes in kidneys (renal papilla, collecting ducts, medullary and cortical scarring).  Also showed decreased spermatogenesis in testes, decreased/missing spermatozoa in epididymides.

&gt;Similar toxicity was found in one male animal at the 30mg/kg dose, but not at the 10mg/kg dose.  Therefore, this study concluded 10mg/kg was the non-toxic dose under the given experimental conditions.  10mg/kg/d in dogs is equivalent to 650mg in humans

**Watanabe et al, 1994**

&gt;Summary:  nefiracetam does bad things to the fetuses of pregnant rats and rabbits in fairly large doses.  No surprise there.  I don't think anyone is advocating taking these supplements while pregnant, so I'm not going to write this one up.

**Sugawara et al, 1994**

&gt;Single-dose toxicity study, trying to find the lethal dose.  LD50 was 2005mg/kg in male mice, 1182 mg/kg in male rats, 500mg/kg in dogs.  Toxic signs included reduced locomotor activity, inability to stand up.  No apparent pathological changes upon examination.

&gt;Human equivalent of 500mg/kg in dogs is 32 grams.  Don't eat that much ;)

**Hooks et al, 1994**

&gt;Hooks again, at a different university.  52 week study in rats, using 0, 10, 30, 100 and 300 mg/kg.  As with the other study, systemic toxicity changes were found primarily in the kidney (papillary/collecting duct epithelial hyperplasia, cortical scarring, mineralisation of papilla.  Also hypertrophy of the liver hepatocytes.  Other tissues showing systemic changes include salivary glands, urinary bladder, spleen, pancreas, adrenals.  These changes were found predominantly in the 300mg/kg dose, but also 100 and 300mg/kg to a lesser extent.  None were found in 10mg/kg dose

&gt;Study concluded 10mg/kg was the non-toxic dose under the given experimental conditions.  Human equivalent dose of 10mg/kg in rats is 650mg.

**The Megadose Dog Studies**

&gt;There are a slew of studies where dogs are given a pretty hefty dosage of nefiracetam for extended periods of time.  The average dose was 300mg/kg/d, which is equivalent to ~20grams in humans.  Unsurprisingly, all kinds of shit goes wrong in these animals - typically kidney necrosis and hemorrhaging, liver hypertrophy.  These are obviously not dose ranges that are physiologically relevant and were performed mostly to determine the mechanism of renal failure, not the safety range of nefiracetam.

&gt;These studies include the infamous ""testicular toxicity"" claims.  The causes of decreased spermatozoa was found to be caused by a decrease in testosterone.  While these doses were abnormally large, similar results were found in the 1994 Hooks paper, where a much more sane level of nefiracetam was applied (30-90mg/kg).


**Shimada et al, 1994**

&gt;Reported slight chromosomal aberrations while using in vitro tests.  Can probably ignore this paper - a lot of things are mutagenic when applied directly to cells in vitro.

I'm currently 20 and attending a Big Ten university, where I am a junior in the mechanical engineering department. I played the saxophone all throughout school as a kid (about 8 years), and had a natural knack for it. I did a lot of DJing and sound production, recording, etc, which required an intimate knowledge of not only PLAYING music, but also the mechanics, acoustics, rhythmic patterns, and the like. I also took classes in German, Italian, and Spanish, all of which I excelled in. Now for the main point of the post:

I can feel myself losing musical and lingual skill as time distances myself from the days of heavy practice. Can no longer tap out complex polyrhythms, can't just ""come up with"" the words I'm seeking in other languages, etc. Enter nootropics. After a few months of daily piracetam and choline administration, I can suddenly do these things again! Speaking with my Latin American co-workers in Spanish is a BREEZE. Like, I'm actually thinking in Spanish instead of actively translating my thoughts as I speak. I also regularly surprise myself with ""Oh that's clearly a tritone substitution"" and complex musical ideas like this that I haven't been able to identify in years.'

So my question is this: has anyone else noticed that nootropics ""revive"" old parts of their brain that haven't been used in a while? Surely I can't be the only one experiencing this.

As far as memory recall and cognition abilities, I havn't noticed THAT much difference from this and piracetam's cognitive benefits.

I know that not all of those are technically ""nootropics"" and at least one I should've avoided from the beginning had I researched it more, but my take overall is that they don't do much, except for modafinil which is a prescription non-nootropic drug. I had the best experience with pira but it was fairly subtle and, given that no one seems to have any clue about the long term consequences (good and bad) of taking any of the above (pira being the one exception, probably), I'm not sure there's much of a point doing it, both for the sake of my wallet and health.
