""This is not my nation any more. This is not my America!"" they say.
Don't laugh- they're probably right.
Because if you believe that America in the 21st century should function under the same assumptions and with the same values as America in the 18th century- then no, this actually isn't your America any more.
If you believe that ""Freedom of religion"" means that you have the right to make decisions about health care, family planning, equal rights, evolution and education for people who do not share your religion- you're in the wrong place.

If you believe that black people vote for a black man only because of race but white people never vote for a white guy because of his race... if you believe that a 90 year old veteran who has been voting for 50 years should be denied a ballot because he no longer has a driver's license... then it's not your America any more.
If you believe that bullying and abuse is ok as long as you do it for Jesus, and that kids are better off in orphanages than with gay parents and that rape shouldn't be an 'excuse' for an abortion because some girls rape easy... this is not your America. If you believe that the working poor, pensioners and veterans in America just want 'free stuff' but the wealthy demand their personal income tax cuts for the good of the nation- no, this is not your America.
If you think you have the right to say who other people can love, this isn't that place.

And if you believe that it's not possible for your candidate to lose an election unless the ""urban"" people cheated...by voting... that an acceptable way to win is to try to stop as many people as possible from voting, that ""bipartisan' means that all the wrong people are supposed to do things your way and that the ""United"" part of ""United States of America"" only applies when your party is running the show... then you don't understand what America is.

It's not a country where you can just 'opt out' when things don't go your way, and where a bunch of people whining that they want to leave will make us turn our backs on our principles. It's not a place where beginning a sentence with ""I'm not a racist' makes it ok to call the President a ni**er. It's not a country where a rich, privileged old man can attack a young woman's character in vicious and almost pornographic simply because he disagrees with her politics and not suffer consequences. It's not a place where we believe that a helping hand in the middle of a natural disaster should come with a pricetag.. 
It's not a nation where we think it's ok for poor people to die from treatable diseases because millionaire CEO's don't want to cut into their profits. 
And thankfully, it's not a nation where bitter, obscenely wealthy men can buy themselves an election.

You folks are the same people who yell ""America- love it or leave it"" at us every time we try to fix what's broken around here. now, it seems like you don't love it enough to stick around and work together. Well, we're not trying to run you out, but you are certainly free to go. Of course you don't get to take your state with you- sorry, but that 'Constitution' thing you're always going on about says the states stay together. And you don't get the flag you're always waving; that belongs to America. But you can leave, if that's really what you want. 

The border is that-a-way.

To them, raping a woman is no different than bestowing to them the gift of life through conception. We see time and again their attempts to minimalize the traumatic effects of carrying their rapists' unborn child to term.

It seems to me, based on the nature of their words, the Republican party, who is often promoted as the pro-life party, should be relabeled the **pro-rape party**. After all, no one has justified the actions of rapists more than these men. Based on the following political views, I am sure the Republicans have the rapist vote secured.

**In regards to an event in one of her novels where a woman is seemingly raped by someone whom the author refers to as the 'ideal man':**  
*If it was rape, it was rape by engraved invitation.*

*... the right approach is to accept this horribly created — in the sense of rape — but nevertheless a gift in a very broken way, the gift of human life, and accept what God has given to you.*

**When asked about Mitt Romney's stance on abortion:**  
*I have been chomping at the bit for you to ask this question... I can't wait to get to it. Let me just tell ya... Mitt Romney has always been personally pro-life .... I know from stories from the folks who were under his jurisdiction [as the Mormon stake president in Belmont, Massachusetts]... that folks were disciplined and reprimanded sharply, even to the point of excommunication, for abortions — under his presiding authority. I know that for a fact .... I want to be very clear — he never in his whole life changed his personal policy which was absolute opposition to abortion on religious grounds .... He is more pro-life than any other man I know .... He's never struggled in his heart about the absolute offensiveness and opposition to abortion. Never has. Never will. He's a friend of the pro-life cause and he will be as President [of the United States].*

Opinion by Roberts. [HERE IS THE OPINION](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/11-393c3a2.pdf)

Ginsburg writes separately for the liberal wing of the Court. Kennedy dissents. 

Updates coming as I can get them out. 

Decision is ""very complicated."" 

Plain English, per SCOTUSblog: 

&gt;The Affordable Care Act, including its individual mandate that virtually all Americans buy health insurance, is constitutional. There were not five votes to uphold it on the ground that Congress could use its power to regulate commerce between the states to require everyone to buy health insurance. However, five Justices agreed that the penalty that someone must pay if he refuses to buy insurance is a kind of tax that Congress can impose using its taxing power. That is all that matters. Because the mandate survives, the Court did not need to decide what other parts of the statute were constitutional, except for a provision that required states to comply with new eligibility requirements for Medicaid or risk losing their funding. On that question, the Court held that the provision is constitutional as long as states would only lose new funds if they didn't comply with the new requirements, rather than all of their funding.

More plain English: 

&gt;Essentially, a majority of the Court has accepted the Administration's backup argument that, as Roberts put it, ""the mandate can be regarded as establishing a condition -- not owning health insurance -- that triggers a tax -- the required payment to IRS."" Actually, this was the Administration's second backup argument: first argument was Commerce Clause, second was Necessary and Proper Clause, and third was as a tax. The third argument won.

The first paragraph from the SCOTUSblog write-up about it (which is still a work in progress; it was copied to the liveblog): 

&gt;Salvaging the idea that Congress did have the power to try to expand health care to virtually all Americans, the Supreme Court on Monday upheld the constitutionality of the crucial – and most controversial — feature of the Affordable Care Act. By a vote of 5-4, however, the Court did not sustain it as a command for Americans to buy insurance, but as a tax if they don’t. That is the way Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr., was willing to vote for it, and his view prevailed. The other Justices split 4-4, with four wanting to uphold it as a mandate, and four opposed to it in any form.

**Roberts joins the liberal wing of the Court in UPHOLDING the mandate as constitutional.** 

&gt;For readers of the opinion, a quick look at pp. 31 and 32 of Roberts' opinion tells you why the Court is sustaining as a tax measure.

Medicaid provision is limited but not invalidated. 

&gt;***the entire ACA is upheld, with the exception that the federal government's power to terminate states' Medicaid funds is narrowly read.***

According to SCOTUSBlog, ""Chief Justice Roberts' vote saved the ACA."" So 5-4, with Kennedy...in the dissent?

&gt;***The money quote from the section on the mandate: Our precedent demonstrates that Congress had the power to impose the exaction in Section 5000A under the taxing power, and that Section 5000A need not be read to do more than impose a tax. This is sufficient to sustain it.***

` `

&gt;The court reinforces that individuals can simply pay the tax and not comply with the mandate.

On Medicaid: 

&gt;On the Medicaid issue, a majority of the Court holds that the Medicaid expansion is constitutional but that it w/b unconstitutional for the federal government to withhold Medicaid funds for non-compliance with the expansion provisions.

Also on Medicaid: 

&gt;The key comment on salvaging the Medicaid expansion is this (from Roberts): ""Nothing in our opinion precludes Congress from offering funds under the ACA to expand the availability of health care, and requiring that states accepting such funds comply with the conditions on their use. What Congress is not free to do is to penalize States that choose not to participate in that new program by taking away their existing Medicaid funding."" (p. 55)

On severability: 

&gt;The Court does not reach severability issues, having upheld the mandate 5-4.

**BIG DEAL: COMMERCE CLAUSE!** -- Would have struck the mandate!

&gt;The Court holds that the mandate violates the Commerce Clause, but that doesn't matter b/c there are five votes for the mandate to be constitutional under the taxing power.

More Commerce Clause: 

&gt;Justice Ginsburg makes clear that the vote is 5-4 on sustaining the mandate as a form of tax. Her opinion, for herself and Sotomayor, Breyer and Kagan, joins the key section of Roberts opinion on that point. She would go further and uphold the mandate under the Commerce Clause, which Roberts wouldn't. Her opinion on Commerce does not control.

Key language re: Commerce Clause: 

&gt;the money quote on the fifth vote to hold that the mandate is not justified under the Commerce Clause (recognizing that doesn't matter because there were five votes under the Tax Power): ""The power to regulate commerce presupposes the existence of commercial activity to be regulated."" That will not affect a lot of statutes going forward.

On the Anti-Injunction Act: 

&gt;The Court holds that the Anti-Injunction Act doesn't apply because the label ""tax"" is not controlling.

Kennedy's dissent: 

&gt;In opening his statement in dissent, Kennedy says: ""In our view, the entire Act before us is invalid in its entirety.""

**Commentary on Commerce Clause, Necessary &amp; Proper:**

&gt;The rejection of the Commerce Clause and Nec. and Proper Clause should be understood as a major blow to Congress's authority to pass social welfare laws. Using the tax code -- especially in the current political environment -- to promote social welfare is going to be a very chancy proposition.

At least one SCOTUSblog author disagrees with the above interpretation, saying: 

&gt;I dissent from Lyle's view that the Commerce Clause ruling is a major blow to social welfare legislation. I think that piece of the decision will be read pretty narrowly.

Footnote 11, re: options under the law

&gt;Footnote 11, which is on page 44 of the slip opinion: Those subject to the individual mandate may lawfully forgo health insurance and pay higher taxes, or buy health insurance and pay lower taxes. The only thing that they may not lawfully do is not buy health insurance and not pay the resulting tax.

As to page length: 

&gt;By the way, the opinions collectively are a monster. The Chief's opinion is 59 pages, Justice Ginsburg's opinion is 61 pages, the four dissenters are 65 pages, followed by a short two-pager from Justice Thomas. You do the math.

As to whether the policy is a good idea: 

&gt;From the beginning of the Chief's opinion: ""We do not consider whether the Act embodies sound policies. That judgment is entrusted to the Nation's elected leaders. We ask only whether Congress has the power under the Constitution to enact the challenged provisions.""",,False,,t5_2qn70,1340896523.0,,,True,t3_vqoi4,http://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/vqoi4/supreme_court_upholds_the_individual_mandate_as_a/,

&gt; 
&gt; The old priest had faithfully served the people of the nation's capital and was well known among the elected officials. He motioned for his nurse to come near. 
&gt; 
&gt; ""Yes, Father?"" said the nurse.       
&gt; 
&gt; ""I would really like to see President Obama and Senator Reid before I die,"" whispered the priest.       
&gt; 
&gt; ""I'll see what I can do, Father"", replied the nurse. 
&gt; 
&gt; The nurse sent the request to The President and Senate and waited for a response.       
&gt; 
&gt; Soon the word arrived - President Obama and Harry Reid would be delighted to visit the priest.       
&gt; 
&gt; As they went to the hospital, Obama commented to Reid, ""I don't know why the old priest wants to see us, but it will certainly help our images."" Reid agreed that it was a good thing.       
&gt; 
&gt; When they arrived at the priest's room, the priest took Obama's hand in his right hand and Reid's hand in his left hand. There was silence and a look of serenity on the old priest's face.       
&gt; 
&gt; Finally President Obama spoke. ""Father, of all the people you could have chosen, why did you choose us to be with you as you near the end?""       
&gt; 
&gt; The old priest slowly replied, ""I have always tried to pattern my life after our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ."" 
&gt; 
&gt; ""Amen,"" said Obama. ""Amen,"" said Reid.     
&gt; 
&gt; The old priest continued, ""Jesus died between two lying thieves; I would like to do the same.""

With over 100,000 radicalized users who troll the new section of /r/politics and downvote anything they consider antigun, the frontpage of reddit has largely been supportive of the NRA position and therefore silent despite the massacre at Sandy Hook.

A few months ago, my friends and I created a sub so that we could lampoon the extreme positions gun owners take.  There is no counter to /r/guns on reddit.  So we decided to make one.  We had fun, until about a week ago when a post on /r/guns highlighted **/r/gunsarecool**, and every single post dating back three months was downvoted into the negatives, wiping them from the front page.  The raid is ongoing.

I was threatened with doxxing on an account that I had maintained for two years that had personal information on it.  So I deleted that one and created this one.

I am not asking for a personal army, and I have not asked for help from anyone up until this point.  Actually, I am not sure what to do.  You don't have to go anywhere or do anything.  Right now I am putting some feelers out to subreddits that I think may be supportive.  /r/democrats may be interested because today we highlighted Biden's support of a young rookie politician inserting an assault ban provision into Clinton's Violent Crime Prevention Act. We also highlight the ongoing vicious attacks on Diane Feinstein, [including one particularly nasty attack today.](http://www.reddit.com/r/GunsAreCool/comments/15ophx/with_her_husband_in_bed_dying_of_cancer_and_a/) So if you have a minute, please go there and subscribe if you like what you see.  Submit, laugh, and upvote like anywhere else on reddit.  Let others know about it or put a link in the sidebar.  And feel free to give us advice on what to do next.

I know today must be tough for you. With the unemployment rate falling below 8% just a month before the election it must feel like a dagger to the heart to see another promise by, what in your view, must surely be the embodiment of everything you fear, don't understand, or both. I say fear because for the segment of republicans that are wealthy, educated, and use FOX news and your SuperPAC dollars to use the rest of the party's ignorance and intolerance to manipulate a group you'll just further disenfranchise with your policies, Obama must be terrifying. A man that lives above the fray, has brown skin, and despite your best efforts to cajole him into the mud with your ""birther conspiracy"" rhetoric, assertions of muslim extremism, and right wing obstructionism just seems to keep on moving forward. By the way, that whole ""our number one goal is to make Obama fail"" number sure shot you in the foot didn't it?  No it's a documented fact that you'd rather run the nation into the ground than give the 99% a sliver of the wealth you hoard to yourselves like a game piece in some sick game of real life monopoly. 

But I digress. I would like you all to remember that although it's a horrible day for you it's important to reflect on what just happened. Despite millions of dollars, obstructionism in congress that has led to an 8% approval rating, 2 wars and what could have been the second great depression, Barack Obama has led a great nation back from the brink and heading true North once again. Not because he's some sort of messiah, but because he's enabling greatness from a nation full of resilient, amazing people. Greatness, that despite your best efforts to make weak and better position yourselves to exploit us and continue to grow your profits while we suffer, will no longer be suppressed. Side by side with President Obama we're building a new kind of nation. The kind of nation built around righteous values for the many, not protected entitlements for the few.

In a second term we'll see an investment in education, energy, and healthcare that will have us creating great middle class jobs and providing a clear cut ladder from the bottom to the middle, and the middle to the top. We'll also see a new Obama that isn't concerned about trying to reach across the isle in his first year, rather we'll see a man with the nation at his back. 

For those of you standing in opposition on the right we have something to tell you.

If you're working class and think letting the fat cats live large will compel them to spill some crumbs for you open your eyes. Link arms with your peers regardless of skin color, creed, or religion and recognize that we have more to gain moving forward together than we do buying into the rhetoric from the right that splinters us apart.

If you're cut from the cloth of the wealthy on the right that has become so effective at manipulating the working class with fear and anger at people that don't look, talk, or believe like they do you should be worried. That won't work in a new economy where those you simultaneously oppress and manipulate for support have the opportunity to see the truth and build a more fruitful life.

In short, dear Republicans - we can't wait to see what happens next.

Sincerely,

The ""Lefties"" with deep roots and an open heart.",,False,,t5_2qn70,1349483829.0,,,True,t3_110rfz,http://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/110rfz/dear_republicans/,
