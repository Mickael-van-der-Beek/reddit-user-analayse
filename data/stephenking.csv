Having The Shining still fresh in my mind, and reading The Stand, the descriptions of the people's experiences seem so obvious to me. 

It was my impression reading this the first time in high school that they had been chosen by God to survive the plague, and then after reading Dark Tower that they had been chosen by Gan, and that God was some of the characters' way of relating their experiences.

But now it seems completely clear. All of the characters we see begin by relating (internally) that they had always had a lot of dreams from a young age. We know of course that Abagail Freemantle and Nick Andros are especially gifted with what Abagail calls ""the shining lamp of God"". But at one point Larry notes that the people in Boulder all seem to stop and stare off into space from time to time, then go on their way having had some revelation. Even Kojak has the dreams.

So, simply put, The Shining makes people immune to the plague, and is what allows Abagail Freemantle and Randall Flagg (both incredibly strong in the shining/touch) to act as ""beacons"" to draw the survivors to them.",,False,,t5_2rce8,False,,,True,t3_1bd8oo,http://www.reddit.com/r/stephenking/comments/1bd8oo/fan_theory_the_shining_gives_you_immunity_to/,

1335935444.0,54,self.stephenking,t2uhe,As a child I was much more frightened by children's movies ala James and the Giant Peach or Alice in Wonderland than any horror film. I could never articulate why. While reading Stephen King's IT I came across a passage that spoke to that fear.(xpost from /r/books),SDBred619,61,7,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/stephenking/comments/t2uhe/as_a_child_i_was_much_more_frightened_by/,"*“He wanted to tell them that those dead boys who had lurched and shambled their waydown the spiral staircase had done something worse than frighten him: they had offended him.*

*Offended, yes. It was the only word he could think of, and if he used it they would laugh —they liked him, he knew that, and they had accepted him as one of them, but they would still laugh. All the same, there were things that were not supposed to be. They offended any sane person’s sense of order, they offended the central idea that God had given the earth a final tilt on its axis so that twilight would only last about twelve minutes at the equator and linger for an hour or more up where the Eskimos built their ice-cube houses, that He had done that and He then had said, in effect: ‘Okay, if you can figure out the tilt, you can figure out any damn thing you choose. Because even light has weight, and when the note of a train whistle suddenly drops it’s the Doppler effect and when an airplane breaks the sound barrier that bang isn’t the applause of the angels or the flatulence of demons but only air collapsing back into place. I gave you the tilt and then I sat back about halfway up the auditorium to watch the show. I got nothing else to say, except that two and two makes four, the lights in the sky are stars, if there’s blood grownups can see it as well as kids, and dead boys stay dead.’ You can live with fear, I think, Stan would have said if he could. Maybe not forever, but for a long, long time. It’s offense you maybe can’t live with, because it opens up a crack inside your thinking, and if you look down into it you see there are live things down there, and they have little yellow eyes that don’t blink, and there’s a stink down in that dark, and after awhile you think maybe there’s a whole other universe down there, a universe where a square moon rises in the sky, and the stars laugh in cold voices, and some of the triangles have four sides, and some have five, and some of them have five raised to the fifth power of sides. In this universe there might grow roses which sing. Everything leads to everything, he would have told them if he could. Go to your church and listen to your stories about Jesus walking on the water, but if I saw a guy doing that I’d scream and scream and scream. Because it wouldn’t look like a miracle to me. It would look like an offense.”*

Man, does Sai King have a way with words. He hit the nail on the head of every nightmare I ever had that lingered with me throughout the day. On every reason why the pink elephant trip in the *Winnie The Pooh* film, or the inanimate objects coming to life in *The Brave Little Toaster* scared me. Or to be more accurate *offended* me.

These few paragraphs defined for me something I couldn't place my finger on. The order of the world cracking, reality shifting. Which is much more frightening to me than any Killer Clown or Knive Fingered burn victim...

Anyway, I wanted to share this with you all. Just had to get it off my chest.

So I had to wait like a decade before I could forget enough of the movie to enjoy the book. 

And oh dear friends, oh good neighbors, did I *ever* enjoy that book. 

It was like good old Stephen King. I read *Under The Dome* and I read *The Wind Through The Keyhole* and I read *Full Dark, No stars.* I'm pretty up to date on his new stuff but am very familiar with his old stuff. And I would say that his work in the late 80's/early 90's is his best stuff. As it is with *IT.* 

I mean, I didn't shower. I didn't go out. I didn't talk to anyone. My girlfriend thought I was mad at her because I stopped calling her. I would wake up and I would read and I would go to work and I would get home and read and then I would sleep for a few hours until I could read some more.  

*IT* was also probably the scariest book I've ever read. I saw the movie and it wasn't very good. I mean, Tim Curry is a good actor and all but it's hard to take him seriously in the role of Pennywise after you've seen him in drag. But this book kept me awake. My mind started fucking with me. I would go out at like 2 AM to smoke a cigarette after a particularly harrowing chapter and I would be jumping at shadows and hearing things and wondering *what would Pennywise be in my eyes? What am I more scared of than anything?*

And *that* is what makes a good fucking book.

Ho. Ly. Shit. Like I said, none of King's stories have ever scared me, until I read Jaunt. I found myself thinking about it all night at work, when I got home, before I fell asleep. 

One of my greatest fears is that somehow, through some crazy accident or something, I'll be trapped in a Johnny's Got His Gun scenario, no feelings, no sight, nothing but my thoughts and no way to escape. Jaunt played on my greatest fear. Looking at nothing but white, for billions of years, with nothing but your thoughts. You can't feel anything, hear anything, see anything. You can't even end it by killing yourself. You're just trapped.

The people who come out on the other end who experience it aren't even human, they are something entirely different. But just imgagine the fear, going for a Jaunt and realizing you fucked up and somehow didn't fall asleep. YOU. ARE. SO. SCREWED. There is nothing you can do, nothing, forever. 

Then there's that one lady whos husband put her through without a destination. She will NEVER GET OUT!

Holy shit King, I've always loved you, and you finally managed to scare the shit out of me. The crazy part is, you didn't do it with a monster, or anything like that. You did it with NOTHING! King played off my fear of nothing!

Has anybody else had feelings like this, not necessarily the Dark Tower, but about any book or story? 

Is the evocation of these feelings down to the skill of the story teller, or did I just allow my imagination to take things that bit too far? Is it a combination of both the story teller and an open minded reader that fosters that feeling of loss when it's all over? 

I don't really want criticism of the ending of the series. All things must have an ending, and as I have learned from these books, the ending is less important than the journey.

1355247404.0,31,self.stephenking,14o9o1,UPDATE: Stephen King Q&amp;A on 12/7/12,LouSpudol,38,7,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/stephenking/comments/14o9o1/update_stephen_king_qa_on_12712/,"I had posted a question about a month ago stating that I was going to attend a Q&amp;A with Stephen King in Lowell, MA where he would answer some questions for the fans. I was uncertain with what to expect and what actually played out fit that. 

It ended up being more like a ""Inside the actor's studio"" setup where there was a small stage with 2 chairs set up. The head of the  English Department (who happened to be a friend  of King's) was the one interviewing him and thus the audience was able to witness an in-person interview with Stephen King. 

Questions asked during the formal interview included a lot of typical stuff revolving around his book ""On Writing"" referencing how he got started and where his ideas come from (the standard stuff). He then went on to tell some anecdotes which I am sure some of you already know about where the idea for Cujo came about and how he came up with the idea for The Stand. These were awesome to hear in person, even if you already knew them. 

Next King read a previously unpublished, unreleased short story that has never been read before. It was regarding a ""Goldman Sach's"" banker who was on his death bed after coming down with a form of colon cancer. He passes away and what the story revolves around is his experience in going through the process of what happens when you die. It is a funny story with another man (being?) who complains that they have been through this 16 other times and that they always have the same conversation. He has the choice to try his life all over again and choose the left door or be dead for good and choose the right one. Every time he chooses the left one and every time the same things occur. I am not really ruining anything as the real meaning and entertainment is in the story itself. 

Lastly, I had written up some of the questions you guys had provided with the hopes of having a chance for him to call on me to ask them. I grossly underestimated the amount of people who would attend (3,000 plus) and realized I would only be able to ask one question if any. Because of this I decided to go with ""Can you describe your experience working with George A. Romero on Creepshow and your first acting gig?"" because others had expressed interest in this topic and Creepshow is a favorite of mine along with both King and Romero. It seemed like a no brainer. 

Unfortunately, they set up the Q&amp;A portion of the event in a very haphazard way. I think they were rushing it a little and decided to say ""first 20 people to get to the lines in the back can ask a question go!"" As you can imagine 1000 people started jumping over railings and cutting people in order to get a spot in line. At my position there was no chance in hell I could have made it there. Because of that, I was unable to ask a question...


There were some good ones, but I will leave you with the last and final question: the worst question I have ever heard in my life. I will try to get as exact as I can...

*Women:* ""I have already been to a couple of your Q&amp;A's before and I remember you saying that you don't like cellphones because you think they are evil-

*Stephen King:* ""I didn't say that""

*Women:* ""well that you don't like them. You also said that you don't carry one for that reason...so...I guess I'd like to ask, do you have a cellphone?""

*Stephen King:* ""Yes.""


That was it. That was the final question. She cut people off and sneaked into line in order to ask a question to which she already knew the answer to. A question which held no purpose or relevance to anything mind you. Who gives a shit if the man owns a cellphone?! Who cares? Do you think he would give you his number? That's like asking someone if they watched South Park last night...adds nothing to the conversation. 

Oh well, there was a lot of great stuff that happened too. It was a good time.

I read Heart Shaped Box last month and now I'm about halfway through Horns. 

I find him unique yet reminiscent of his father in a very pleasant yet unassuming way. It's kind of familiar but also very different. 

Pretty cool. 

Do you Stephen King fans dig his work? 

I love all the music references, the characters with so many character flaws, and his ability (like his father) to perfectly capture what it was like to be a child. Heart Shaped Box really frightened me at some points too, which I haven't experienced from a book in quite a while. 

I'm becoming a big, big fan of this guy, and although I'm sure my love for his father somewhat influences my view, I'm genuinely impressed with him based on his own writing. 

Both books have been intoxicating reads, I read for hours on end. 

Just looking for opinions/criticisms, whatever. He's my newest ""favorite"" author and I can't help but think how proud his dad must be of him.

I love near enough most of the adaptations of his work even if they may differ from the source material from time to time as I've heard, from 'The Shawshank Redemption' to his original television project 'Storm of the Century', and more recently 'The Mist', his stories seem to lend themselves brilliantly to the visual mediums, be it Film or Television (granted, not all of these adaptations have been stellar). I was apprehensive at first to jump straight in to his works, so to speak, I had high expectations...the man and his work have become iconic in popular culture at this stage...and I didn't want to have those expectations shot down and end up never returning to any of his material, so I wasn't sure where to start but I happened upon a relatively new printing of 'Salem's Lot that was quite cheap..which didn't hurt, and presented as good a reason as any to start. I was familiar with some of the criticism that some people have heaped upon his writing and from what people who've read this in the past have told me about..that King seem's to wander off on tangents detailing minor events considering barely substantial characters or events which occurred in whatever fictional world you're delving in to... I have to say though while I can see where they're coming from, I love how much thought and detail has gone in to presenting a fully realized world, you can begin to believe and really get to grips with the history and culture of Jerusalem's Lot, it's not pandering or bloated exposition, but a retelling of events which help shape out the setting and it's characters and it's this kind of stuff I'm finding myself loving so far. I'm about halfway through now and it's definitely addictive and rewarding stuff so far....

What's everyone else's thoughts towards 'Salem's Lot? I realise mine could be radically different from a lot of people since this is the first King novel I've read but I would love to hear what other people got from it. (minus spoilers of course ;)

I just pulled down IT to reread, and noted the timeline.  Well, if the cycle holds, and if The Losers weren't 100% successful, 2012 or 2013 is the time to return.  So, what does Reddit think?  Was It really defeated?  Or will it come back?  We've now seen that the monster may be connected with the Tower in some way, and Derry has always had those connections, so would the activities of the Tet corporation between 1985 and 2012 have done anything to ensure It's death, or on the other hand, to do anything to reawaken It?

I know SK has historically not done sequels, but with Doctor Sleep coming out soon, obviously that's changed.  (I wrote a bunch of internet posts about 10-15 years ago that Danny Torrance, as an adult, might meet up with Charlie McGee, and wouldn't that be interesting?)

1371144465.0,28,self.stephenking,1ga32f,Theory about Dark Tower series [books 1 &amp; 2 spoilers],pandalf_the_grey,34,6,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/stephenking/comments/1ga32f/theory_about_dark_tower_series_books_1_2_spoilers/,"So I'm finishing up the second book of the series (The Drawing of the Three) and a theory about the book dawned on me.

It seems to me the series, thus far at least, is a metaphor for the process Stephen King goes through in writing the series- so the whole series is meta, and King is the gunslinger.

In the first book, for example, King is brain-storming in the desolate foreign land that is his mind; picking up characters that he may keep around, but ultimately dropping most of them and keeping them as a distant memory. This violent process of creating and killing is signified by him killing all of Tull after developing some characters (namely Allie). Also, he is chased out of the town by a witch who essentially makes the whole town turn on him, just as the story would turn on him if he spent more time on these minute characters in this small town. In other words, he knows he needs to think bigger, and he can't expand the story in the tiny town of Tull. I guess in this case Allie's warning to never say Nort's trigger word could be a sort of warning to keep the end of the story in the back of his mind, but to not solidify it at the expense of the story. Like death, the end should be discovered upon getting there, but our mortality (the end of the story for King) should always be kept in the backs of our minds. 

Next, he relates that he often finds main characters in unexpected places; he meets Jake in an old weigh station in the middle of nowhere, and he acts as a saving character to both Roland, and to the story- he propels it forward and injects heart into it. Roland/King knows from the beginning that in order to propel the story into a larger concept; a touching story of the cold-hearted Roland thawing because of a young, naive boy isn't enough. This is emphasized right before Jake dies and says ""there are other worlds than these;"" meaning you can't just focus on me. Furthermore, the man in black signifies his driving force, even if at times he is hesitant to do what is right for the story, as it seems cruel or radical, King still listens to the driving force.

Then King moves on to his second phase in the Drawing of the Three, which is getting into the minds of the characters he has decided to make main characters, and delving into the challenge of actually developing them. This is signified by him literally entering their minds through the door. King relays that he oftentimes finds it difficult to relate to and understand his characters, but he comes to terms with it and is able to embody them and steer them as he needs, oftentimes using their back-story  and the knowledge the character has as a way to stay true to the character. 

Ultimately, each of the characters that Roland enters becomes a metaphor for a struggle that King has when writing. Eddie is clearly the character he most closely relates with in this stage of the process in that, like Eddie, he feels like an addict, always only thinking about writing instead of living in the moment. It can be torture feeling so consumed by his craft, but when he gets his fix, or in other words makes great progress or has a realization for the story, it is equivalent to Eddie shooting up and feeling euphoric. O/detta's kleptomania represents his desire to steal ideas from other authors, even though they would end up looking cheap and vulgar in his own writing. She also represents the challenge of not turning characters into caricatures. Detta is a racist caricature of an African-American woman, while Odetta lacks depth and the ability to feel anything but kindness and understanding. O/detta is a representation for hollow characters and caricatures, and King knows that if the two can look at each other, as in the mirror, and become one, then she would be a whole character. Her halfness is physically represented by her lack of legs i.e. her inability to move herself in the story without other characters doing so. Finally, Jack Mort represents how King may vicariously live through his characters to fulfill some deep desires he would never act on. King feels that acting on these desires is sick in a way, but he also cannot help it. In order to propel the story forward, and make sure it doesn't turn into a auto-fellating novel that only serves King as a reader and no one else- as seen by the fact that whenever Mort harms/kills someone, he ejaculates in his pants- King must smother this self-indulgent part of himself.  

King sees the whole process of writing as not only self-indulgent, but also masochistic. He must take big risks in order to get what he needs to make a great story, which is represented by Roland robbing the gun store and the pharmacy. 

Finally, Roland being sick throughout this book represents how draining it is to inhabit the characters and to put himself into the story- to become someone else and simultaneously put so much of himself into them and become so invested in them is exhausting. Furthermore, Roland's alienation from the modern world (NYC specifically) expresses how alienated King feels from the world during this process. Writing is a very introverted process and can oftentimes make it difficult to function normally in the real world. Also, being a writer requires endless observation of society and looking at the world objectively. Such a lifestyle can cause disillusionment with the world, and a sense of futility regarding human nature.  

Roland and King are one, and what one suffers, the other suffers.

Anyway, I obviously don't know if this theory stands for the rest of the books, but my SO, who is on the 7th book, says it makes a lot of sense. Thoughts??

TL;DR the Dark Tower series is a metaphor for King's writing process/struggles. Also Roland = King

In order to spread the love, I'm planning to give folks who want just a few books priority, then put the ""everything"" folks in order and go down the list and let them decide if they are still interested or not.

If you want to estimate shipping, you can go to http://postcalc.usps.com and my zip code is 99577. After putting in the info, go down to ""Other Options"" and find Media Mail. A 10lb box (3-4 books) to a random zip code in the midwest came out to about $6. (If you want the books faster, I'd be happy to send Priority instead, but the cost will be a lot higher)

The whole collection is somewhere in the neighborhood of 120 lbs, so figure by the time the 1- and 2-book shipments get taken out, the rest is going to be something like (2) 40lb boxes.

For individual books, the individual book weight is approx. 2.5 lbs for a hardcover, 3.5 for a larger HC like IT or Stand, 1-1.5 lbs for the smaller hardcovers &amp; softcovers, and 0.5-1lb for the paperbacks.

I'm off to work now, but I'll compile a list of who gets what to post later today. If you are just seeing this post, it's not too late to shoot me a message.

------------------------------
EDIT 2: Here's my list of what's spoken for so far.

I am wanting to give away my old King collection. I still read King, just in audiobook form nowadays, and these books are just taking up space I'd like to have back. I sold off most everything that was worth any money a long time ago, so this is just misc. stuff that's left.

I'd love to give the books to someone who will appreciate them to read or to add to their collection. Anything that's left after this will just go to Salvation Army.

All I'm asking is for you to the pay actual shipping cost, not a penny more. I am in Alaska, so Media Mail is by far the cheapest option, it just might take a while to get to you. Either take everything or pick and choose it doesn't matter to me. First come, first serve. Just PM me and let me know. The list is below, somewhat grouped but in no particular order.

He introduced me to ""adult"" reading at age 12, and has entertained me for 14 years on from that. His stories take me away from the world and put me into the character's position even if I'm only killing time before my burger is ready. He's a brilliant man, and I hang on his every word.

Then something weird happens. I've *tried* over 4 times to read 'Lisey's Story' all with the same outcome. I cannot for the life of me get past 100 pages. I've read (with gusto) so many of his not-so-much-horror novels and eaten up every word. Yet this ONE story that I still have just taunting me everytime I look at it, I can't overcome. 

Has anyone else had this problem? Some will probably say ""It's okay not to like a story from your favorite author"", and I can agree, but why only this one? It's not because the main character is old, I love reading tales told in an older voice. I don't know what it is.

I've always imagined *IT* as a pretty straight forward horror tale for whatever reason, mostly due to the mini series I'd imagine -but no.

I'd be hesitant to say the novel is even about a murderous clown.

So, Pennywise is a vampire of sorts - feeding off the imagination of humans. Did the turtle create It while vomiting out the universe? Or was It always around, beyond our ""dimension""? If Marturin and It are natural enemies - one of creation and one of consumption, where exactly does Dandelo fit in? Is he/she just another version of It, but for that universe/dimension? This is where I'm kind of lost. It gets pretty psychadelic.

He is a great writer with tons of original and fun ideas.  I've noticed that some of his more recent books have been piling on a sense of dread and depression in them that makes me squirm while reading them.  Under the Dome as an example did a good job of slowing putting the town under the control of Remy while Dale's small team of heros is put under more and more pressure to save the town from itself and the dome. 

I'm reading 11/22/63 right now and it has the same feeling of impending doom for George/Jake in that the obdurate past is going to come crashing down on him.  He keeps placing these bets and I know he is going to get in trouble for them eventually with the mob.  I am reading this knowing that he is going to be ruined by his actions and he isn't doing anything to stop it.  I feel like King has been reading and building off of how Cormac McCarthy writes and I mean that in a good way.

Tommyknockers is another depressing one that is a little tougher to read but still really good.

All of the Richard Bachman stuff has this giant sense of doom and dread over everything. 

Are there any other good King books that are just depressing and feeling like everything is leading towards inevitable doom that I could be missing?

What if, every week, we were to create a [discussion] topic about a particular book. Every week, we would discuss parts of that book, help other people remember reading it, and then perhaps we could also post a comment in that topic that said our vote for next week was whatever book we wanted.

Then, at the end of that weeks discussion, someone could tally up the votes and create the new topic. 

It would be easy to avoid spoilers, simply post a spoiler tag in the topic title and then if you have not read the book and do not want to be spoiled, stay out of the topic! 

If this idea take off, which I kinda hope it does, I would like to humbly suggest that the first book we discuss is either Misery or It, since I have very recently read both of them.

When Devin is dumped towards the beginning of the novel, it stirred up memories of my own first breakup. The way Devin deals with it is exactly how I dealt with it. 

Joyland was set in North Carolina for the majority of the story, which is where I live. 

The Carnivalesque: The moods from beginning of ""The Dead Zone"" and ""Something Wicked This Way Comes"" can be felt in this story. 

The way King used the first person perspective to tell the story of a college student trying to find his footing in the world is much like the title novella in ""Hearts in Atlantis"". 

A certain scene towards the end where [Devin has a romantic rendezvous with a ""foxy"" character] (/spoiler) was exactly what I hoped would happen.

There is very little to criticize the book about. The dialogue was slightly forced in spots, but I think this was King intentionally being campy and mimicking the dime novels of his childhood.

I tend to get the feeling From a Buick 8 is generally a ""meh"" for SK readers. I just would like to attempt to vouch for the story, as it is one of my very favorites. From a Buick 8 is a beautiful departure from a lot of SK's normal works. It explores the ideas of dealing with both the unknown and what you otherwise can't change. Where does one turn when their past is haunting them so? Religion, suicide, the strange comfort of what you can't ever understand? Why must I be the one to suffer? The character development is phenomenal, there is a lot of reading in between the lines you should try your hardest to do (always read between the lines!). Think of Hearts in Atlantis, which I found similar in overall feeling. It's not overtly action packed, so if that's going to be a big problem, try another story; but I'd also like you to question yourself as a reader if that's your top priority. All in all, out of all the SK novels I've read so far, and I certainly haven't had the chance to read them all, From a Buick 8 does the best job sending a clear and beautiful message: You can still change your future but not your past, so don't let the past take the driver's wheel in leading you to your future.",,False,,t5_2rce8,False,,,True,t3_1dvk76,http://www.reddit.com/r/stephenking/comments/1dvk76/anyone_care_to_discuss_from_a_buick_8/,

1- What exactly happened when Las Vegas was blown up. Was it a direct act of God, or of Flagg's cockiness (It was blown up with the lightening ball that killed the cook) or what? The scene confused me. 

2- What was the point of discovering Joe/Leo Rockway's telepathic abilities? Did they ever serve a major purpose?

3- What was the significance of ""Baby, Can You Dig Your Man"", Larry's rock song? My best guess is that it reminds him of himself from before the flu, but his fear and absolute detest of the song suggest something else.

I found this piece of paper tucked away in my old King collection. I can't remember where I found this, but I must have stumbled across it back the in the prehistoric dial-up Internet days and printed it out. A Google search doesn't come up with anything so I thought I'd share.

If you don't know, ""The Killer"" is a one-page story written by King in his early teens. It was originally submitted to ""Spacemen"" magazine in the early 60's but not accepted.

The FJA mentioned in the signature is Forrest J. Ackerman, editor of ""Famous Monsters of Filmland"", in which the story was published in 1994. I am not sure if this is a copy of what was printed in the magazine, or a copy of a personal copy given to Ackerman, as I have never seen the magazine myself.

I think of books like The Shining, Rage, and Pet Semetary, and I feel like King really dug deep into the darkness of his soul for those books. Later, he wrote more heartfelt novels like Insomnia, Bag of Bones, and The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, which explore an entirely different aspect of the human psyche.

But I just finished Song of Susannah, and I've been crying for ten minutes now, and so for one more time I'm going to wank on about what an amazing singular story his body of work is.

I don't know Stephen King. Obviously. If I did, *that's* the factoid I'd be desperately forcing into every conversation I ever had. But fucking hell, is there any author that pulls you into their life more intimately than King? 

Putting aside the obvious thing (that King's body of work gradually forms itself into one epic, enormous story, uniting countless novels and short stories, hundreds of characters and stories into one single epic), King manages to put so much of himself into them as to make it into a crazy autobiography. Not just through the stories themselves, made up of major parts of King's life (the ongoing motifs of writers, Maine, battles with addiction/alcoholism, and the ultimate triumph of love, relationships and family over evil), but through the innumerable Introductions and Author's Notes, filling in the gaps and explaining the relationship between his life and his stories. He welcomes his Constant Readers in, and pours out his whole history to them over the course of his life's work, giving them a clear sense of the things most important to his development as a person.

On Writing, was... christ, that in itself was a writing guide that gave you the deepest possible insight into the mind of its author. It's not strictly a biography (though it does have elements), but you still come away from it with a deeper sense of who King is than you do with many genuine autobiographies, perhaps mainly due to his emotion and frustation at the accident that had such an impact on him. This too is entwined with his work, crippling/fatal accidents and crashes playing a major part in the works following his accident (Dreamcatcher, From A Buick 8).

Then... fuck. Then, after Wolves of the Calla... you've got Song of Susannah. There's been hints (perhaps underplaying it a bit) in previous Dark Tower books, but this is the one that finally unites his entire universe, all of his characters and all of his stories: 'to a greater or lesser degree, every story I have ever written has been about this story'. For a brief moment, it seems like things are going to get a bit meta-wanky; Roland and Eddie seek out an author named Stephen King, wondering if he is their God.

But... but *fuck*. At the end of the book, he includes a journal from the fictional Stephen King, detailing the epic production of the Dark Tower series at the behest of ka. And it's *brutal*. Basically his life laid bare, it lays out his entire writing career, covering the myriad real-life inspirations for the books we've read, detailing his battle with addiction and alcoholism, his desperation to win, the ultimate victory of the love of his family and the success of his children.

And then he kills himself in the goddamn fucking crash.

And you don't know Stephen King, but you do. You know what he loves, what he fears. What he appreciates and what he regrets. What things and events have significantly influenced his life, and what ultimately makes him who he is.

And then he *fucking kills himself in the crash*. And that's him, fucking laid out bare. You thought you were reading the epic tale of 'The Dark Tower', but you're not. It's not about him being the God of the story. It's just about the story being him, and all that he is. To the point that, despite not appearing as a character until Song of Susannah, his fate is so well-established through his previous work as to make it the most meaningful and tragic thing that could possibly have happened.

Christ, this is so wanky (I think we were alright for a bit, but it really tailed off at the end there when I tried to get all meaningful and snappy). But I'm going to put it here anyway, because I need to put it *somewhere*, and then I'm going to go away forever and comfort eat.",,False,,t5_2rce8,1368060981.0,,,True,t3_1dyxjl,http://www.reddit.com/r/stephenking/comments/1dyxjl/song_of_susannah_and_reading_king_in_order_or_why/,

In fact, I feel the movies based on Kings works generally tend to be some of the worst adapted movies out there. I'm not saying they are bad movies, just poorly adapted. I think that is mostly due to King writing 900+ page novels tat usually get condensed to 2 hour movies. 




That being said, I just finished reading Dreamcatcher last night and immediately popped in the movie afterward. I've seen the movie 2.5 times before. First time I bought it used and it just stopped playing half way through. I returned it and a few weeks later bought a new copy and watched from the beginning. It was enjoyable, but nothing special. The next time I watched it I was completely drunk by the end and only really remember the first 20 minutes or so.




I thought the book was pretty great. Again, nothing brilliant, but I really enjoyed it and managed to get through it in 4 days. All the while reading it, I didn't remember a lot of it from the movie so I was very excited to rewatch it after finishing the book, and fuck me freddy, what a god awful movie. 




[SPOILERS FOR DREAMCATCHER BELOW]






The first half was actually pretty good, pretty much right up until Henry gets caught by the Blue Boys. I know some stuff needs to be cut and that is fine, but there were way too many changes for no reason. Way too many revelations were revealed way too early on. They completely dropped the byrus telepathy, which I feel was one of the most interesting parts of the story. 



There was not nearly enough character development,  Beav and Pete were killed within the first 30 minutes or so and thus they seem completely pointless. The way the handled Duddits was atrocious. He didn't seem retarded or special, just like a stupid kid with a speech problem. And the way they handled Mr Grey.... what the hell was that? The accent, the faces he made, his ability to transform into an ""adult byrum"", and the completely got rid of the idea of him slowly becoming more human. 



The worst of all was the ending, in which it was revealed Duddits was actually an alien that was sent to earth to stop these other aliens? what the fuck was that?




All in all they completely ruined what was actually a pretty decent book. There has been other movies that were no where near as good as the book, but this one just really shat all over the book in ever way. 




Runner up: Bag of Bones. Ugh.

I have owned three versions, two of which I read into disrepair, and finally an ebook for my Kindle that is holding up well.  I have two copies of the DVD miniseries as well (a back-up, because it was hard to find the first time, so I bought two).  The point of that little blurb is - I have dedicated a significant portion of my life to the book (and that is a little bit sad).  The movie adaptation thread a few days ago got me thinking critically about it, and I thought I would share my thoughts.  Regardless if anyone reads this, getting it off my chest feels good. 

**The Good**

Gary Sinise as Stu Redman.  Period.  If Sinise wasn't so good as Stu, I think he could have pulled off Roland, but I don't think one person could do both.  This was masterful casting, and he pulls together a lot of weak points (the crew of doctors in the various hospitals during the flu were not particularly talented).

The cameos and bit players.  Ed Harris as Starkey.  Kathy Bates as Ray Flowers.  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.  Ken Jenkins as Frannie's dad.  I'll even go so far as to say Ossie Davis as The Judge (although his death scene wasn't the best).  Whenever one of these guys popped up, it was a treat.

Other good casting:  Roy Walston, Peter Van Norden, Miguel Ferrer, Bill Fagerbakke and Matt Frewer.

The crucifixion scenes looked as real as I would like to see.  Also, the buildup with Larry and Ralph at the end looked good, until the very end.

""Baby Can You Dig Your Man""

Tasteful omissions:  I never really liked The Kid's story line, and wasn't sad to see it go.  Cutting the soldier execution game show in favour of Frannie and her dad listening to Ray Flowers on the radio worked really well.

**The Bad**

Casting-wise:  Jamey Sheridan was OK, but the part really needed someone more powerful.  He did the jovial part well (Flagg always seemed to me as if he was enjoying himself), but the malevolence just wasn't there.  Laura San Giacomo as Nadine / Rita was unimpressive, but I don't know if a better actress would have pulled off that debacle.  I already mentioned the doctors, also the people from Arnette.  

Frannie should have told her dad she was pregnant, to get it out of the way.  It shouldn't have taken until she hooked up with Stu to get that fact out.  

Ugh, I wanted to slap Shawnee Smith, but I wanted to slap Julie in the books, so maybe this isn't a complete negative.

Nick's reaction to finding the bomb in the closet.  Dear God.  Rob Lowe was not particularly well suited to this role.

The delayed reaction shots when Stu kills Dietz.

Glen Bateman getting quite heavy-handed with the religion on Lloyd after he gets shot.

**The Ugly**

The Hand of God.  If you watch the DVD commentary, Miguel Ferrer says ""that's a pretty tall order"", which is true - but it was still terrible.

The Rat Man.

Stu's fall when he broke his leg.

The Hand of God.  It deserves to be mentioned at least twice.

And as much as I love his characters, I've not been a huge fan of his longer novels, mostly because the endings tend to be a huge let-down.

Anyway, I just got done with Insomnia, and it's almost definitely one of my favourites so far - including the ending. For a few reasons really, some of which are bigger than the book itself. I do love the book, because it's a great story, a nice exciting one, which is also pretty tragic. Has some of King's best characters so far, in Ralph and Lois and McGovern, which also leads to there being a lot of really nice stuff about getting old, and looking back on youth. Lois was a really sweet character. But I really liked Ralph especially as a character, and his getting involved in the major events going on just to do what was right, even though he didn't really have a lot left in his life. Something I loved about the book was that I'm pretty sure you don't ever find out what Ralph's stance on abortions is. There's the occasional mention of him being a bit sad as to the distrust against him as a man, but for the most part he's a neutral party - in the main debate itself he doesn't take a side. But he does intervene simply because he wants to do what's right.

But also it's amazing as part of the ongoing writing of King, and makes me want to reccomend that everyone reads his stuff in order when they first read it - the ongoing use of certain characters, and the returns to towns like Castle Rock and Derry are great and all, plus the endless references to different books, and characters bumping into main characters from previous books, but *Insomnia* is the first one that's pulled it all together and made it feel like a huge universe, using the Dark Tower to gather everything together. The plot itself is really minor in the grand scheme of the overall plot [they're saving one kid so he will eventually save two people, presumably helping Roland to reach the Tower, and saving the entire plot from a momentary wobble](/spoiler), but it's the first time that has made it all feel like the gigantic story that it is. The entire scene on the hospital roof, just hinting at how big this universe and the tower are, is really exciting.

5. *The Thing At the Bottom of the Well*

6. *The Stranger*

7. *The Cursed Expedition*

8. *The Other Side of the Fog*

9. *Never Look Behind You*, along with those above, was published only in the 1960 self-published magazine *People Places and Things*, and does not appear to have been printed anywhere else.

[Spoilers],,20,2,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/stephenking/comments/q5kx9/112263_ending_has_really_bummed_me_out_spoilers/,"Sorry if similar threads like this have been made in the past, but I just had to get my feelings out. First off, I really loved 11/22/63. As a long time Stephen King fan, I think it was one of his better books, in terms of it having a front to back fluidity. I even thought the ending was actually good, in terms of it not being flimsy, far fetched, or unsatisfying. 

And yet, it just hit me in the gut. It was both the mix of feeling sad that the story I had become so invested in was coming to an end, and what I find to be the tragic circumstances of Jake. I guess what really made me sad was that he had to suffer. The fact that he had to live his life in a time he no longer considered his time, and knowingly had to live away from the true love of his life, only to meet her again when they were ages apart. I can't help but think about all the character developments we had witnessed in Sadie and Jake. How Jake had really changed her life. And to know that was deprived from her, and him in the original timeline, was just depressing. 

I know i know. Sadie went on to do great things. Jake was happy she didn't die. But the fact that we experienced her life, and saw how much it changed, just really bummed me out that she didn't really get that in the end (or at least the version we witnessed). I guess one could argue there were ""residual"" effects from the other strings, so technically that string wasn't a complete waste. That it did have somewhat of an impact on them. But goddamnit, it was just so depressing to me.

The ending made sense, and I think from a technical point of view, it was pretty masterful. I'm usually not one to want a happy ending. And in fact, I think had he made it a happy ending where Jake got her etc. it might been cheesy and a cop out. But still, I've been sulking around for a couple days now. 

Anyone else feel the same way? 

Lastly, what should I read next? Was thinking maybe Duma Key. I need another story to get my mind off this one.

I've seen a lot of the film adaptations, but I've never gotten around to actually reading any of the books before. There was one thing that stuck out to me as odd:

It wasn't... scary.

The movie was moderately scary, and I have no doubt that King's stories can be scary. 'It' is still one of my favorite horror movies out there (and the book is the next King story in my list which I have none doubt will freak me out, because fucking Pennywise). However, horrific, chilling, haunting, etc... are not words I would use to describe the way I felt reading this book. 

More than anything I felt sympathetic towards Carrie. To me, she felt more a tragic hero than a nightmare. I felt indignation toward Billy and Christine, for obvious reasons. Pity for Sue Snell at her failed attempt to atone for her actions, and for Tommy who was just trying to be a nice guy. Hell, I even had a hint of righteous fury after all the shit Carrie went through in her life. 

I think that if Carrie had had a normal childhood and grew up happy, with friends at school and a normal mom and what not, her reaction might have been a bit more chilling. But the fact that her actions were just so non-senseless (I guess) just leaves me with an 'I totally get it"" attitude. Did anybody else have this reaction to the story, or am I as weird as her?

I definitely agree with Stephen King that he finds this work to be ""raw"" and ""with a surprising power to hurt and horrify."" I was not expecting it to touch me so deeply. I identified with Sue Snell and at times (shockingly) even Carrie. The story just resonated with me.

I also liked the way the book is written in an epistolary structure, through newspaper clippings, magazine articles, letters, and excerpts. It made everything that happened seem more real.

It was the first novel King published, however, he originally tossed the first three pages in the garbage. 

&gt;Some woman said, 'You write all those macho things, but you can't write about women.' I said, 'I'm not scared of women. I could write about them if I wanted to.' So I got an idea for a story about this incident in a girls' shower room, and the girl would be telekinetic. The other girls would pelt her with sanitary napkins when she got her period. The period would release the right hormones and she would rain down destruction on them… I did the shower scene, but I hated it and threw it away.

His wife found the pages and encouraged him to finish it.

**If you haven't read 11/22/63, you need to leave this page now**

Well, we know from 11/22/63 that it was, in fact, Lee Harvey Oswald who killed Kennedy.

After thinking on this for a while, I think that it isn't necessarily a plot conflict, although it is a bit of a stretch. My idea is that after Sadie died, Jake immediately started dealing with an internal struggle:

* Continue with the plan to save Kennedy
* Reset time and save Sadie

Of course, when Jake went back to the future, the choice was simple because the future had gone to hell due to the fact that Kennedy had been saved, not to mention the whole thing about the universe destroying itself. BUT perhaps Jake would have reset time regardless of the future in order to save Sadie. In a forced way, making Sadie the cause of Kennedy not being saved, and therefore being killed.

IIRC in some other book *cujo* gets spoiled a little or it tells you who got killed by him or something like that because *cujo* was published before the other book, assuming that everyone reading that book had already read *cujo*. 

anyway, my question concerns the *dark tower* series. since i haven't read it yet i thought that maybe you guys could help me out.  
i plan on reading the DT series in a row - so should i read all seven (eight) books at the beginning when the first one came out (after *the running man*) or should i read everything else and read it after *colorado kid* when the 7th book was published? or should i even wait until *wind through the keyhole* to read them all consecutively?

also, *wind through the keyhole* - read it after the fourth book or after the seventh? will it spoil something if i read it after the fourth? 

same goes with *talisman* and the *black house* - i guess since it was written with straub it isn't wholly a part of the king-universe and won't be spoiled by another book and also won't spoil anything else? am i wrong about that assumption?

Near the climactic end, as they are travelling through the pipe system and entering the final chamber, the scenes are shifting back and forth between 1958 and 1985.

Richie smells an oversize flannel shirt, one that might be found on a large Paul Bunyan... but he smells it in 1958... yet it wasn't til 1985 that he has his encounter with the Bunyan statue.

Now, was this an King error that was not caught in editing, or can we assume that IT is some sort of time surfer, and the difference between the two periods is not linear as we see it... so it offered up the scent of 1985 fear to the 1958 Richie accidentally?",,False,,t5_2rce8,False,,,True,t3_trkf2,http://www.reddit.com/r/stephenking/comments/trkf2/rereading_it_deep_insight_or_author_oversight/,

Obviously there is a strong connection between The Talisman and the world of The Dark Tower (Question: are they the SAME world?), and it struck me as I read Jack's foray into the Black Hotel that this book is really the story of Roland Deschain.

Jack seeks the Talisman as a way to heal his mother's cancer and, as a result, to also heal Laura DeLoessian... but the Talisman is described as ""the axle of all possible worlds"", which sounds EXACTLY like the Tower. It IS the Tower. Reading Jack's trip across the US/The Territories is like reading a mini version of Roland's journey.

Questions: Are the Tower and the Talisman one and the same, or are they two fictional nexus points for fictional infinite worlds? 

Can we see Jack's success as a conclusion to the cyclic nature of Roland's quest? I feel like I get some closure that The Dark Tower doesn't really provide. 

Also, something a little removed from this that I wonder throughout the story... this is a collaborative work of King and Straub, but since I've never read Straub, I don't get a sense of how much he and his writing style contributes to the text. There's a VERY VERY VERY clear and constant sense of King, though. (I was especially struck by the series of events when Jack actually gets the Talisman, basically retribution and righteousness for marginal characters, that is so much like the end of IT.)

I've never read any of his fiction, but I have read his On Writing book. So, anyway, I've always flirted with the idea of reading The Dark Tower. I've skimmed the Marvel Comics, etc., too. But, I've been hesitant to jump in head first because I've heard some chatter about them being densely tied to Stephen King's earlier works.

If I pick up Book 1 cold, will I ""get"" the series? Or, is it weighed down by continuity and his many other books?

When I first read UTD, I admit I was a bit disappointed in the ending. It seemed to run out of steam and then just drop off. I thought the alien kids watching us was a bit retarded, but later on when I found out it was IT related (I read UTD before IT and had no idea about that symbol), I felt a little better about the ending. 

So what do you guys think? Will the change the entire end? Make it some crazy government conspiracy BS? Will they leave the aliens and drop the IT? Will they give it a bit more ""oomph"" so people aren't pissed they wasted a bunch of time on the show?

I really hope they keep it as close to the book as possible, with a little added oomph. 



PS - Also as we all know, Dean Norris from Breaking Bad is playing Big Jim, Today I just remembered that Big Jim had a meth lab in the book. I hope they touch on that and kinda reference BB.

I thought it'd be fun to talk about which ones we liked most and least, and why. 

It doesn't seem like there's a spoiler markup for this subreddit, so I'll just bold the names.

The one that had the most impact on me was **N.**, from *Just After Sunset*. The emphasis on the stress and mental breakdown rather than the horror elements themselves was really refreshing and effective, and the way the nested narrative coldly, bluntly shows the spreading of N.'s ""cold"" made the situation seem so hopeless for everybody. To me it's the most *horror* thing King's done.

The one I *enjoyed* most, for the pure fun of it, was **The Ten O'Clock People**. Stories like *They Live* and *The Matrix* -- where the view of the real world is suddenly shaken in a non-supernatural way -- are always so exciting and compelling, and immediately stimulate the imagination. The story oozed paranoia and I was so disappointed to see it end -- I would've loved a full length novel based around that premise. 

I think the *worst* story I've read so far is **The Lawnmower Man**. I don't even have any specific criticisms of it, it just hit me as nonsensical -- I put it down and thought only ""What?"".

Night Shift - Grey Matter

&gt;    I once knew a fella named George Kelso, who worked for the Bangor Public Works Department. He spent fifteen years fixing water mains and mending electricity cables and all that, an' then one day he just up an' quit, not two years before his retirement. Frankie Haldeman, who knew him, said George went down into a sewer pipe on Essex laughing and joking just like always and came up fifteen minutes later with his hair just as white as snow and his eyes staring like he just looked through a window into hell. He walked straight down to the BPW garage and punched his clock and went down to Wally's Spa and started drinking. It killed him two years later. Frankie said he tried to talk to him about it and George said something one time, and that was when he was pretty well blotto. Turned around on his stool, George did, an' asked Frankie Haldeman if he'd ever seen a spider as big as a good-sized dog setting in a web full of kitties an' such all wrapped up in silk thread. Well, what could he say to that? I'm not saying there's truth in it, but I am saying that there's things in the corners of the world that would drive a man insane to look 'em right in the face.

Mike Hanlon, when learning about who the woman is, says (note, he says this seriously, in presence of Ralph and the abortion lady): *""Goodness gratious great balls of fire!""* When I read this line, I burst out laughing.

I have seven days before classes start, which gives my a two-hundred-pages-per-day pace. This is completely doable.

Is there any value to a first edition copy of IT? I paid $9.98 for it at the bookstore and some websites value this book at $99 others say it's only worth $15.00. What gives? Should I keep this book safely tucked away on my bookshelf and pick up a paperback copy just to be safe? Any thoughts?

It's not been so bad with his other collections, but most of the ones I've read in N&amp;D so far have felt just way too flabby, with a lot of uninteresting, irrelevant detail. Even though probably the main reason I love King is for his characters and the way he fleshes them and their history out, it's starting to niggle that all of the stories in here feel like the horror is just *completely* buried by normality and normal life (which is how I feel about a lot of his books, It especially, but that's a whole other story).

So far my favourite stories fro this book have been Popsy (guy kidnaps a child who has a friend looking for him) and You Know They Got A Hell Of A Band (couple end up lost in a town with people who look like rockstars), but mostly Popsy, because You Know They Got A Hell Of A Band sums up my problem a lot. Popsy is a pretty short thing, and is really mysterious and intriuging, ending on a creepy note that just makes you realize what's going on. You Know They Got A Hell Of A Band, after a really overlong start which sets up a load of stuff which is irrelevant to the rest of the story (I feel like, as strong as his character stuff is, it way undermines the horror stuff - this story could be much more effective without the marriage stuff, and it has no real relevance to the story so it's not really needed), really forces the ending, over-explaining something that's already fairly clear but could have been more memorable if left on an earlier line - without the waitress explaining it all and then the main character reinforcing it in her head. Most of the other stories in the book so far I think put in so much characterization and backstory that the horror aspect, which would be effective in a shorter, punchier story, are left feeling sort of uninteresting and predictable. Although oh, The Finger creeped the shit out of me, though that may be more because I have a thing about body parts that spout and grow in ways they shouldn't that really fucks me up.

Looking at his bibliography, it seems like this is a point in his career where he started writing a lot of fairly long books. Unsure if this is like a JK Rowling 'editors don't want to tell the successful author to cut it down' sort of thing, but I suppose I'll see. So what do people think?

Let's see, we have old character rehashes: Rennie and Junior -&gt; Henry Bowers

We have a plot device that had such potential for an awesome resolution, but the  actual resolution was so... freaking... weak. [Kids? Fucking *Kids?!?* Was anyone else hoping it was alien tech from Tommyknockers powering the Dome, maybe an experiment by The Shop?](/spoiler)

You have the wonderfully swift and cunning maneuvering by the antagonist, and a slow build-up of a solution by the protagonists, but then? [Everyone fucking dies and the main bad dude pretty much accidentally falls on his own sword? Weak, man. WEAK!](/spoiler)

Anyone else catch the (only?) DT tie-in reference? The phrase ""kabbalah"" which only appeared (I think) in Black House?

I hope King has his game on with Blockade Billy...

""Throttle"" was a pretty tense story, though it reminded me too much of the Spielberg film *Duel* to seem overly original.  Still a good read.

""Face..."" was great in a Rod Serling / Alfred Hitchcock sort of way.

""In the Tall Grass"" was probably my favorite, though ""Mile 81"" was a close second (I always love King's portrayal of kids).

""Guns"" was an informative read, too.  I still object to King's pulling of *Rage* from circulation, but that's just me.

If you were hired to make a adaptation of any King story for a medium of your choosing, how would you go about it? Keep in mind that a adaptation is often better than a straight up translation, so for best results it's sometimes necessary to change the story around a bit to better match the medium -- Look at the Goldeneye N64 game versus the movie it was based on!

---

For me? Well, let me tell you...


My project would be a video game adaptation of The Stand, and though it would try to stay faithful to the book, it would take some liberties where the interactivity of Video Games would be a boon to the story.

1. ""THE JOURNEY"" The first part would have the player taking control of one of the groups traveling to Hartford Home/Boulder early on in the story. This would play out a bit like The Oregon Trail, with the players having to keep a eye on medicine/food/water levels plus the health and population of their party. The player would run into various random events along the way, both entirely new and drawing inspiration from the events of the story.

2. ""THE RECONSTRUCTION OF BOULDER"" The game would switch to a more Sim City-ish type of gameplay. In it, The Player would have to try to clean up Boulder, rack up supplies and get population within a set time limit. Meanwhile, The Player would also have to arrange spy missions to Las Vegas and attempt to establish contact with other civilizations.

3. ""MISSION TO VEGAS"" In this mode, The Player would take control of Glen and co. would have to advance west to Las Vegas. This would cut back to the Oregon Trail-style Gameplay. Perhaps the player would be able to change events around -- [Maybe Stu will pick a better spot to climb down?] (/spoiler)

4. ""THE HAND OF GOD""  the game would switch over to gameplay like that of a Adventure Game. [This would mainly just be pissing Flagg off in jail and stalling until the Trashcan Man arrives with the bomb.] (/spoiler) Perhaps the player could manage a jailbreak and flee before the bomb goes off?

5. ""BOULDER FOREVER"" -- This would be a mode unlocked upon beating the game: The player would continue to either keep tending to Boulder or start a new civilization. In boulder, fallout from the explosion at Vegas could be a issue...

Overall, there would be a scoring system based on how many non-hostile deaths were prevented plus supply surplus. If the player gets a high enough score, there  be some sort of little stinger or silly little Easter egg... or perhaps a alternate mode where the player controls a group of survivors led by a TetCorp employee sent to watch over things and make sure Flagg is defeated?

I'd like the ability for the player to have the ability to change certain plot events (such as the ability to talk down Harold from going berserk by making the right actions/dialogue choices), but i'm not sure if that would be implementable without affecting the quality of the writing too much. Then again, King DID like the movie version of the Mist's new ending...",,False,,t5_2rce8,False,,,True,t3_1caeg5,http://www.reddit.com/r/stephenking/comments/1caeg5/spoilers_implicit_adaptations_how_would_you/,

Without spoiling anything from other books in the series, I wanted to clear up a few things. First off, The Man in Black was Marten from his youth? Marten was his teacher? I get him confused with Cort. I know Cort was his trainer. Did he kill Cort to become a Gunslinger or merely beat him in a battle? I have a feeling we will see Jake again, but I was confused with what actually happened? Did he fall on traintracks into the slow mutants at the last second? 

Lastly, more of a comment, the final scene where the Gunslingers meets O'Dim and he speaks of the Tower to him and their world in relation to the universe...that was one of the best scenes in a King book I've come across so far.

Personally, I know of its existence through reading about it some years ago upon completing the book. Sadly I have never gotten a chance to view it - I couldn't seem to get ahold of the DVDs via Netflix and somehow I missed the window for watching it on instant streaming from 2011 to this July. Don't ask me how I managed that one, I really outdid myself there in terms of obliviousness. 

By most account the miniseries was decent. Gary Sinise as Stu Redman, Jamey Sheridan as Flagg, apparently well all well put on by the cast. However, as is the case with many a TV or film adaptation, much was left out. I'm not the type of person to complain about that sort of thing. The endless ranting and raving of Harry Potter fans about film omissions and people who still just can't get over the fact that Tom Bombadil wasn't in The Lord of the Rings movies bore me to tears. I understand that cuts must be made, certain things don't translate easily or well from the page to the screen, budgets, time constraints, all that. TV and movies are not books. I say that so that my next statement won't come across as that of one more fan whining about what was left out of the original Stand miniseries. 

As a Stephen King fan, someone who mostly watches TV from the 21st century, and a huge fan of HBO and its many beautifully crafted series (how good is Game of Thrones?), I think a reboot of The Stand as an HBO miniseries would be excellent, quite frankly, a lot of fun. There are a couple of things I think HBO could bring to a reboot that would adapt The Stand as it deserves:

- A bigger budget. Sure, The Stand is in some ways a very intimate, personal story without a whole lot of sweeping action, but it is also an epic that involves dozens of characters traipsing across these United States in the wake of a plague that nearly wipes out humanity. A budget to support the scale of the narrative and truly show events as we imagine them unfolding would go a long way to telling the story well. HBO could deliver on that.
- No content filter. *The Stand* is dirty, gritty, and downright disgusting at times. It's part of the style, it's part of the story. HBO has license to push envelope here where other networks do not since it is a cable network.
- More airtime. A season of HBO runs about 10 episodes. The original miniseries was six hours. If you adapted *The Stand* in one season on HBO you'd get four more hours to develop story, character arcs, and deliver more of the moments we loved from the novel.

Those are my three main points. There are dozens of subpoints and little things that I think would make an HBO reboot of *The Stand* a great thing. But I want to know how you feel, Reddit. What would you say to a new adaptation of *The Stand*? TV, big screen, or not at all? Who would you like to see cast as who if they aired it next year?

Of course, throughout the entire novel I had mentally pictured many of the characters as current actors. I was disappointed when I looked at the cast for the miniseries (and of course newer characters added in that weren't in the book...but is anyone ever pleased with such casting?). 

Who did you imagine as the characters in the book? (if anyone) Or who could you foresee playing these roles?

Immediately for Big Jim, I thought of Brad Leland (Buddy Garity from Friday Night Lights) http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0500894/?ref_=tt_cl_t6 
However, I think they casted this role well with Dean Norris

Oddly enough, I thought of a MASH-era Alan Alda for Barbie (the witty banter gave me this image)

For Julia Shumway, I had Julianne Moore.

For Rusty, I had David Costabile (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0182345/) 

For one of Big Jim's cronies (Frank I believe?), I had Chris Owen (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0654104/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1) *Also in the Mist, and I guess a cliche choice for a goon

Those are the main ones I had - Who did you visualize in these roles? Right now I'm on the fence about the TV show - just by researching it a bit it sounds like they're changing it quite a bit.

Do you think it's possible he started the series with a concept fresh in his mind, and it somehow petered out for a few years? Or maybe you disagree completely, which is fine, too.

""Frisky would have told them that the black scent approaching them from behind did not belong to a man; it was a monster chasing them, some horrible It."" 

The fact that he capitalized the word ""It"" stood out to me and yet it is the only time he refers to the antagonist in this way. As if the dog is the only one who can see It for what It is. An interesting approach if you read IT and felt confused about the origin of the monster.

It changed the feeling of the books for me. I was no longer reading a fantasy epic, where the laws of reality felt rigid (relatively speaking), I was reading an experimental, surreal new genre. It broke my suspension of disbelief and made the events of the previous books feel hollow somehow. Am I alone in this? Did anyone else feel like stopping?

God bless your brothers,  
sister facing monsters in the night;  
the flashing muzzle of the gun  
ignites the room and snuffs their light.  

Mother with her damaged cub into  
the darkness run. 

Oh! Father! Killer of your Father!

were different now, things were good.  
Love and structure taming that unholy

Then everyone was gone.  

You came home.  

With no other in your sad life, you  
went to finish your dream; that dream  
you had since soaping up wheels for dimes.  
A ripened America: dry and barren.  

After, with your burnt twisted body you  
fall to your knees in exaltation and wipe a  
patch of skin from above your eye. Eye.  

The dark all-seeing eye, in a crow flying  
nearby with a moment of clarity the world  
falls into place, perhaps, nay, definite realization  
when your life has sudden meaning. Kneeling agape

The author is pessimistic about the idea behind it, but I'm a glass is half full kind of guy. 
1. At least the project is being tackled and it has money and Hollywood power behind it. Ron Howard can get pretty much anything he wants done accomplished. 
2. NBC has been getting its ass kicked by pretty much every other network for years. This is something that will bring an instant fan base and could be their ""Lost."" They are probably also smart enough to realize that this doesn't have to be ""American Idol"" (25 million viewers) because a more realistic number of viewers is likely to be super-dedicated (multiple viewings, involvement on-line, purchasing DVDs (with extras and unrated material).
3. The world is ready for this type of fantastic material - everybody lets their geek flag fly. Every network is trying to cash in on sci-fi, fantasy, comic book type material - and the ideas are half-baked with no real clue on how the story ends. No problem here - the whole thing is mapped out by arguably one of the greatest living authors. 
4. Smart move, btw, for NBC to get into the King business. You think if they handle this well they won't get a try at other projects?
5. lastly, people crap on Goldsman for writing ""Batman and Robin"" - he also wrote eight episodes of ""Fringe,"" ""A Beautiful Mind"" and ""Cinderella Man."" There are hits and misses among the rest of his resume, but the guy isn't one of the minds behind ""Meet the Spartans"" or anything - he's an Academy Award nominee who has just landed a chance to work for the next 5-10 (?) years of his life on one of the best projects possible.

King/Straub describe this process vividly as if he is changing from one to the other similar to the way Wolf changes from man/beast to wolf. 

This raised the question of *What then is a twinner?*. I was under the impression that most people of our world have a twinner in the Territories. That there are basically 2 of you existing in separate universes simultaneously. If this is true, how is it that Morgan is morphing from one person into the other?

Jack is able to move between the Territories and switch each time because his twinner died as a baby (or so I am told as of now).

When Jack see's Morgan's diligence coming down the Western Road is he seeing the real Morgan Sloat from the ""real world"" visiting the Territories or is he a separate Morgan - the twinner of Morgan Sloat existing simultaneously?

For me, I started really reading King thanks to my favorite show ever, LOST. I read an interview witht he writers once that said they always kept a copy of The Stand with them, and that got me interested. 


So now, for the most part, whenever I read the books, I tend to picture them as the actors from LOST. Seeing as LOST drew a lot from not only The Stand, but all of kings work, sometimes it works really well, as the physical description and the personality matches LOST. 


Then of course, sometimes, if I have seen the movie multiple times before getting to read the book, I get stuck envisioning as that actor, which sometimes is great, but sometimes really sucks. Corin Nemec as Harold Lauder? Really?

New to the sub here. Just finished 11/22/63, and while I enjoyed it quite a bit, I'm a little bewildered by the ecstatic response. 


And beware, there are **SPOILERS** below...


My background: I'm a huge genere fan, but when it comes to King, I've mainly read his more 'realist' stuff (The Body, Shawshank Redemption, The Stand, etc.) Nothing against his other stuff, it's just worked out that way. When I heard about 11-22-63, I was super excited, and I really enjoyed the first three quarters. 


But after awhile, I began to get irritated when random things would happen that were chalked up to ""time protects itself."" I know it was set up in the beginning, but it just seemed like too much of a crutch to create suspense, without any real payoff or meaning. 


It was like King couldn't/didn't want to create suspense from the idea of changing history, but from some vague, monster-in-time conceit that seemed pretty Final Destination. He'd write in some outlandish obstical to Jake succeeding, then write ""The past is obdurate"" and that would explain it.


I was fine with this through most of the book, until Jake succeeds in stopping Oswald. Then we get a ""And now there are earthquakes"" ending that didn't really seem to jibe with the rest of the book. All of the effects of stopping Oswald are washed away in the ""These earthquakes are so bad they'll turn Earth into a second asteroid belt"" ending. 


Did anyone else feel cheated like this? Did I miss something that would make it work? Thoughts?

  We can talk about the nitty gritty- his sentence styles, and use of language.

Finally, he settles in a New Hampshire town, an AA community that sustains him, and a job at a nursing home where his remnant “shining” power provides the crucial final comfort to the dying. Aided by a prescient cat, he becomes “Doctor Sleep.”

Then Dan meets the evanescent Abra Stone, and it is her spectacular gift, the brightest shining ever seen, that reignites Dan’s own demons and summons him to a battle for Abra’s soul and survival.

I liked DT4, because even though it was 90% flashback, the flashback was so well written, it glued my eyes to the pages - and there was another factor: the main story progressed just enough (Blaine the Mono, how could I forget thee?) and so brilliantly that I did not mind the flashback at all.

In TWTTK however, the flashback about the skin-man is not that interesting in the first place, and the tale inside that flashback was mainly a bore for me also. Reading Tim's story, I desperately wanted ""out"", wanted to get one narrative layer up, wanted the skin-man story to progress. Reading the skin-man story, I wanted the main story to progress. And oh, another important fact: **there is no main story to speak of.**

You could argue the same about DT4 (Blaine aside), and hell, you would be right. But taking shelter from a storm is just a setup, a narrative frame, an excuse, if you will to tell a flashback - whereas in DT4, the Blaine thing was a natural progression of the story, and the stuff at the end of the book was also fitting. It was not much, but what was, was right (and we got tons of useful info regardin the universe in the flashback). Here, the main storyline does not add much to the saga, if any.

Which brings me to the skin-man story. It had interesting elements, but it was not nearly as well written as DT4. And this, this is my main problem: **none of the stories are well written.** Because this is King we are speaking of (my fave author for a long long time), the book is a decent read. But this is the problem: decent. Not interesting, not intriguing, just... decent. For this reason, I struggled for months finishing it, because nothing pulled me back to it.

The overall conclusion of Roland's story is a worthy addition to the saga, no doubt about it. But the journey is what matters, and the journey wasn't as pleaseant as it should have been.

**Parts I liked:**

- Tim in the swamp
- Tim and the Tyger
- The conclusion of Tim's story
- The way the second half of the skin-man story was written
- The overall conclusion of the book

**Parts I did not like:**

- The beginning of each story. The exposition parts were really boring. Even though I like such stuff in other DT (and King) books, this was not a fun to read.
- The ""identity"" of the skin-man. The solution was too starightforward with the white scar and all, and the creature itself was not horrific enough. I wanted to have some of the old-school King mindfuckery, but I was disappointed...
- Not enough new information is provided in the book in general. The book was too verbose and content was scarce.
- It is not well written enough! DT4 blows this out of the water, the writing style in that book is not only one of King's best, but one of the best in the world of literature IMO.

A ton of characters; almost too many to keep track of. However, the payoff during the climax was worth slightly less than what I paid for (see what I did there?).

A question for the more experienced Stephen King reader: does he generally use humor in his other novels? Among some of the more fast-paced scenes, there seems to be a tad bit of ridiculousness that sort of subtracted from mood of the story. It felt too interrupting (keep in mind this is my first SK novel). Considering this book was published in 1991, SK's reference to Bruce Springsteen and how he will never compare to Elvis seemed a tad out of place. Also, a guy out for revenge, gun in hand, is described [as squatting and shitting on his future murder victim's framed photograph of the the poor fellow's mother.](/spoiler) As immature as it sounds, I lol'd. The town's--what I like to call--""battle scene"" comes off as some sort of royal rumble straight from a pay-per-view episode of WWF.

This may seem like a stretch, but SK may have touched on all seven deadly sins with this book. I'd have to take a tad bit more time to think about it, but it seems plausible.

[Most importantly, Alan Pangborn learns a crucial lesson: what's done is done. If you focus on past darkness, then you run the risk of bringing some of it with you into the future.](/spoiler) This was the most haunting part for me personally--the only way I could relate to the protagonist.

Overall, I do not regret reading it. I do regret, however, loosing my virginity to this one.

King ends the novel with a brief discussion of his desire to elaborate on MYSTERY ITSELF -- not necessarily it's resolution. Perhaps the novel was written to occur in our universe, our Maine, and to be taken as it is presented at face value.

BUT. Is it possible that Cogan, who made it from Colorado to Maine too quickly for commercial flight and without ANY evidence of private flight, was somehow drawn into one of these alter universes? There is never any purpose established for why he ended up on the island, and it also seems that he is somehow aware that he will be left without ID, hence the cigarettes. 

I checked out The Colorado Kid's Wikipedia site, and there's a quote from King's personal website:

&gt;The review of The Colorado Kid in today’s issue of today's USA Today mentions that there was no Starbucks in Denver in 1980. Don’t assume that’s a mistake on my part. The constant readers of the Dark Tower series may realize that is not necessarily a continuity error, but a clue.

Unlike the original novel, I’ve written this ending in the third-person, partly because I envision it as a film alternate-ending, and believe it’s easier to envision this with third-person writing.

Prior to this point in the story, the only change I would  make to King’s version of the events is that Al Templeton, the owner of Al’s Diner, would be shown to be more alone in the world. Perhaps when Al dies, our protagonist Jake looks up at Al’s bedroom walls and notices that Al has no recent pictures of himself with any close friends or partners. Al reached out to Jake (somewhat of a stranger), because he had no one else to reach out to. 

*  *  *  *
As Jake and Sadie begin to climb the stairs of the Texas Book Depository, the dark skinned security guard – Bonnie Ray Williams - starts to chase them up the stairs, shouting at them to stop and leave: “Hey, ya’ll ain’t allowed in ‘ere!” 



Sadie urges Jake onward, but she herself stops, and begins to talk with Mr. Williams, working her womanly charms to persuade him to give up his chase. 
Jake arrives on the 6th floor, he hears the first two shots. As Oswald goes to take his third shot, Jake turns a corner and puts a bullet through his head. “Oswald is dead, and Kennedy is alive” Jake thinks to himself, as the gravity of the situation settles in. Never before in the course of human history – anyone’s history, has that statement been true. 



Moments later, Jake is shaken from his thoughts as he hears Sadie’s footsteps rushing up the stairs. Simultaneously, Jake hears the elevator doors open. From the open elevator emerge two uniformed men. They turn and see Jake, gun in hand. 


Behind them, Sadie steps out onto the 6th floor. Her tired legs begin to sprint towards Jake, and – breathing heavily – she shouts to Jake “Did you… did you do it!? Did you shoot him?”


The uniform men turn, guns drawn and see Sadie running towards them. They fire, hitting Sadie in the face and dropping her to the ground. Enraged, confused and in a futile attempt to save Sadie, Jake lifts his gun and opens fire on the two officers, hitting one in the head and striking the other in the arm. The officer with the arm wound steps back into the elevator and quickly closes the door. 

Jake runs to Sadie, but it’s no use, she’s gone. In a whirlwind of emotions, feeling as though he’s achieved his greatest goal and sacrificed his only love, Jake holds Sadie’s body and promises that he will bring her back. Jake looks over at the dead police officer and without hesitating, strips the man of his uniform, dresses himself in the pants and shirt, and begins to head towards the stairs. 

Looking down the staircase, Jake sees multiple officers on their way up. He looks at his gun, then without thinking about it, shoots himself across the skin of his forearm, causing significant bleeding, but what he hopes is only a minor wound. 

Jake begins to descend the stairs, and as the agents approach him, Jake declares that he’s been shot by a madman on the 6th floor, hiding behind the boxes. The officers run by him, guns drawn. 
It seems the past is no longer so obdurate. 

In the confusion on the main floor, Jake escapes the building, and shakes his head, fully understanding the ignorance and incompetence that let Oswald escape in that past that no longer existed.

Rounding the corner of a nearby building, Jake throws his uniform in the trash, using the shirt one last time to temporarily wipe his wound dry.  Jake begins his race back to the rabbit hole. 



It’s a harrowing journey, but Jake makes it back to Lisbon Falls. He parks his car, walks past a sign warning of ongoing construction, and the spot where the yellow card man had met his end. As he begins to walk across the field, he hears a voice before he sees anything. Faintly, Jake can make out something that sounds like “eat’n glack… just eat’n glack”. 

Jake looks around for the source of the sound, and he continues walking towards a rabbit hole that he hopes still exists. Then, abruptly, he sees it: It’s another yellow card man, standing there, seeming to flicker in and out of existence. His back is to Jake, and his message is clearer now: “Just get the meat and go back, just get the meat and go back…” over and over.  Jake stands there staring at this apparition, unable to piece together what’s going on, when suddenly, the card man flickers away, and then flickers back to life facing Jake. 

Displaying extreme calmness, but using words that betrayed that façade, the card man sees Jake and beings to speak: “Jimla, Jimla, you don’t know what you’ve done. You have to go back now.”
“Why, what’s happened? What have I done? What about Sadie?”
“Jake, you must go back now.”
“Well who are you?! What’s going on?!”
“Jake, all I can say is that we’ve been watching you. We watch Al too. We watch you whenever you come through the bubble. We’re… well, we’re a sort of guardian I suppose.”
“So you’ve been protecting me?”
“No, we’re not guardian angels. There are things far more important than individuals at stake. It’s our job to keep the universe straight and together, like a bundle of twine. Each time someone travels back through a bubble, like the one here, twigs from that bundle begin to break, and if enough twigs break, the whole bundle can fall apart. It’s our job to keep the bundle together, to harmonize the timelines, to tie up the broken branches.”
“So every time I felt the past harmonizing…”
“There was one of us nearby.” 
Jake stares at the card man, who continues to flicker in and out of sight. 
“Jake,” says the card man, “you have to go now.”
And with that, Jake steps over to a rock on the ground, puts one foot forward, and begins to enter the rabbit hole. 


Emerging through the rabbit hole, Jake isn’t sure if he’s surprised or not, as he looks around and realizes he’s in the back of the Al’s Diner. Looking around, nothing seems terribly out of place. Jake takes a deep breath and heads to the front of the diner. As he rounds a corner, he bumps into Al, who is clearly startled as he drops a tray of food and throws his hands to his chest. “Dear lord, Jake, you scared the lights out of me!” 

“I, uh, Al, you’re alright! Oh my God!” Jake finally gets out his intended phrasing, as the two both seem shocked to see one another. 

As Al composes himself, he gets a slight look of confusion on his face, which quickly turns to nervousness. “Jake, what… what are you doing back here?” 

Jake looks at Al, realizing the implications of his time travelling adventures: If Jake saved Kennedy in 1963, then Al didn’t waste the last 5 years of his life in Texas hunting down Oswald. He never developed cancer, and he never needed to pass his lifelong mission onto Jake. Jake isn’t supposed to know about the rabbit hole, in fact, he wonders to himself: “Does Al even know about the rabbit hole?”

Al snaps Jake out of his deep chain of thoughts – “uhh Jake, you alright? You didn’t, ah, see anything out of the ordinary back there, did you?”
Jake takes a second to collect his thoughts, and then decides that if anyone needs to know the full implications of this mission, it’s Al. 
“Yes, Al, there’s definitely something a bit out of the ordinary back there” Jake says, finally cracking a bit of a smile. 

Convincing someone that they exist in an “alternate universe” is never an easy task, but Jake decides to go back the beginning, and explain everything to Al. As Jake begins to explain, a middle-aged women walks into the dinner with a smile on her face and car keys in hand.  

“Well, well, well, looks like my ride is here,” says Al. “Jake, this is my wife, Brenda. Brenda, this is a friend of mine Jake, don’t think you two have met.”

Jake and Brenda exchange pleasantries and Jake casts a glance towards Al, wondering if it’s okay to keep telling the story of the past. 
“Oh, don’t worry about Brenda here, she’s the love of my life, knows all about the little portal back there. You won’t weird her out with any tales.” 
And so Jake decides to carry on. “Well, you see Al. You called me in here one night… “ And then Jake trails off, again wondering how much of this story to tell. Does he really want to tell Al that in his past life he died before he was able to accomplish his mission? 

“You see Al, in our old world, back in 1963, a president was shot and killed, and it changed the course of history. You were determined that if you could stop that assassination from happening, the world would be better off.” 

Al’s face is struck with a look of bewilderment, and then his eyes slam open and he looks at Brenda, then back at Jake. 

“Oh my God. Are you the fourth man? Jake, you’re Officer X? People have spent the past 50 years looking for you! Most people think you’re the shooter. There are more conspiracy theories about that shooting than about the moon landings!”
“What do you mean?”
“Jake, you’re the mysterious person that was with Sadie Dunhill, the man who stole an officer’s clothing and then disappeared!”
Jake stares hard at Al, and then pieces it all together. “That was three days ago for me.”


Jake, Al and Brenda spend the rest of the night in the diner, trying to piece everything together, and being constantly interrupted by Jake’s desire to look up aspects of his former world and see how they’ve changed. He seems relieved to find that most things are exactly the same, or slightly improved. Vietnam still happened, but Martin Luther King Jr. is alive and the world seems to have turned out okay. It looks like Jake meddled with the past just enough to not break the bundle of twigs. 
As the evening comes to a close, Al offers to drive Jake home.  

On the ride home, the conversation lulls, and as Jake sees Al and Brenda sitting together in the front of the car, he’s struck with feelings of loneliness, and longing for Sadie. He looks at Al, thinking about how amazing it is that Al is alive and healthy. Not just alive and healthy, but happy too! 

Going back to save Sadie would mean risking Al’s life and his relationship with Brenda. Is it his place to put that on the line to try and save Sadie? If the mission was to save Kennedy – then hadn’t he succeeded? Hadn’t everything turned out nearly as perfect as it could? Could he really go back and jeopardize so much just to put an end to his own feelings of loneliness? 

With these thoughts weighing heavy on his mind, the car pulls up in front of Jake’s house, and Jake is relieved to see it looks just as he remembered it. He thanks Al, gives a smile and walks up the front steps. He lifts the welcome mat at the front door and gives a little smile as he pulls out the key and unlocks the front door. 

“Finally home, I guess”, he thinks to himself. 

Sighing heavily, Jake kicks off his shoes and heads straight upstairs to his bedroom. He walks over to his bed and sits down. It’s just then, as he reaches over and turns on the bedside lamp with a *click*, that he also hears the breathing – that breath in the room that belongs to him, but isn’t coming from his lungs. Somewhere in the back of Jake Epping’s mind a  bundle of twigs makes a crisp snapping noise, and as he glances backwards onto the bed, he turns just in time to see another Jake Epping roll over and open his eyes.

I've read ""Hearts in Atlantis"" and ""The Stand"" when I was in High School. Years later (about a decade), I've picked up the Dark Tower series. Just before that, I had a conversation with my brother that had me commenting that Stephen King is the most talented author I've read, with the most relatable characters, great original stories, and most of all, the best dialog. 

So I began my own ""journey"" to the dark tower.

In the prelude to the gunslinger, Stephen King apologizes for the first book being pretty rough. He tells us to continue on; it's worth it. By the end of the book, I accepted his apology, and continued to the 2nd book. And the 3rd. And the 4th.

My questions are the following:

Am I too old for this? Why do I not like these books - **at all**? And most importantly (and the reason for the rant, I want an honest response to this question): Do they get better? Should I finish them, having not liked them up to the 4th book?

Here are my bones:

* 1) Oy. I hate him. But I also hated the stupid talking raven in the Game of Thrones books. (Overall, though, I loved that series)

* 2) The Wizard of Oz scene. Really. It wouldn't be so bad if he actually *justified* it somehow. Why was it there? What place did it have in the books? I don't know if he justifies it later, but I feel that should have been taken care of in the book it was written in.

* 3) Book 1 failed to establish Roland as any kind of a true badass, before books 2-4 go through the trouble of turning him into comic relief material. Much like Oy. (Kaka? I mean, come on! We've heard it already.) (""______"", Oy agreed. - yeah, we've heard that already too.)

* 4) Love story is weak. I'm sorry.

* 5) Evil Characters are not evil enough or competent enough. With the exception of Gasher. He was well done.
 
* 6) [MACHINE GUNS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQg8JKo_3ZQ) (referring to Alain's use of the ""machine gun"" (which I assume is actually an assault rifle))

* 7) Every time there was a fight scene. Ambiguous details, poor realism and believability... I could rant about this one in a wall of text itself. I understand action scenes are hard to write, but at least try to paint us a pretty visual picture.

* 8) Dues Ex Machina so thick you couldn't get through it with a power saw. Whatever, he kind of justifies it with *Ka*, but that still doesn't explain the stupid Oz thing. And why'd he bother bringing Andrew back if he was just gonna get picked off again without ever being interesting.

* 9) I knew most of the riddles he used from other sources, and the whole Blaine thing reeked of Gollum. I know our Author is creative enough to come up with a few good originals, why didn't he include some?

* 10) My biggest complaint: The Author Told Us Exactly What Would Happen in Book 4 Before It Happened. **It's NOT foreshadowing if there are no bloody shadows!!**.  And still the book was long. And I had to read the whole dang thing without any kind of surprises at all. He keeps ending chapters or sections with ""And that was the last time he saw her"" or ""Years, later, they would all be...""... It makes me want to cry. :(

Sorry Dark tower lovers, I really am. I WANT to love these books. I love westerns and badasses and action and drama speckled with tragedy and romance. That's my thing. So why do I like The Stand and Hearts in Atlantis, but not the Dark Tower (so far)?
