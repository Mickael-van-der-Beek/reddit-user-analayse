Subject: Hi Lauren

Hi Lauren,
 
I’m disappointed in you. I’m disappointed that I haven’t gotten a response to my voicemail and text messages.
 
FYI, I suggest that you keep in mind that emails sound more impersonal, harsher, and are easier to misinterpret than in-person or phone communication. After all, people can't see someone's body language or tone of voice in an email. I'm not trying to be harsh, patronizing, or insulting in this email. I'm honest and direct by nature, and I'm going to be that way in this email. By the way, I did a google search, so that’s how I came across your email.
 
I assume that you no longer want to go out with me. (If you do want to go out with me, then you should let me know.) I suggest that you make a sincere apology to me for giving me mixed signals. I feel led on by you.
 
Things that happened during our date include, but are not limited to, the following:

-You played with your hair a lot. A woman playing with her hair is a common sign of flirtation. You can even do a google search on it. When a woman plays with her hair, she is preening. I've never had a date where a woman played with her hair as much as you did. In addition, it didn't look like you were playing with your hair out of nervousness.

-We had lots of eye contact during our date. On a per-minute basis, I've never had as much eye contact during a date as I did with you.
 
-You said, ""It was nice to meet you."" at the end of our date. A woman could say this statement as a way to show that she isn't interested in seeing a man again or she could mean what she said--that it was nice to meet you. The statement, by itself, is inconclusive.
 
-We had a nice conversation over dinner. I don't think I'm being delusional in saying this statement.
 
In my opinion, leading someone on (i.e., giving mixed signals) is impolite and immature. It’s bad to do that.
 
Normally, I would not be asking for information if a woman and I don't go out again after a first date. However, in our case, I'm curious because I think our date went well and that there is a lot of potential for a serious relationship. Of course, it's difficult to predict what would happen, but I think there is a lot of potential for a serious relationship developing between us one day (or least there was before your non-response to my voicemail and text messages).

I think we should go out on a second date. In my opinion, our first date was good enough to lead to a second date.

Why am I writing you? Well, hopefully, we will go out again. Even if we don't, I gain utility from expressing my thoughts to you. In addition, even if you don't want to go out again, I would like to get feedback as to why you wouldn't want to go again. Normally, I wouldn't ask a woman for this type of feedback after a first date, but this is an exception given I think we have a lot of potential.

If you don't want to go again, then apparently you didn't think our first date was good enough to lead to a second date. Dating or a relationship is not a Hollywood movie. It’s good to keep that in mind.
In general, I thought the date went well and was expecting that we would go out on a second date.

If you're not interested in going out again, then I would have preferred if you hadn't given those mixed signals. I feel led on.
We have a number of things in common. I’ll name a few things: First, we’ve both very intelligent. Second, we both like classical music so much that we go to classical music performances by ourselves. In fact, the number one interest that I would want to have in common with a woman with whom I’m in a relationship is a liking of classical music. I wouldn’t be seriously involved with a woman if she didn’t like classical music. You said that you're planning to go the NY Philharmonic more often in the future. As I said, I go to the NY Philharmonic often. You're very busy. It would be very convenient for you to date me because we have the same interests. We already go to classical music performances by ourselves. If we go to classical music performances together, it wouldn't take any significant additional time on your part. According to the internet, you’re 33 or 32, so, at least from my point of view, we’re a good match in terms of age. I could name more things that we have in common, but I’ll stop here.
I don’t understand why you apparently don’t want to go out with me again. We have numerous things in common. I assume that you find me physically attractive. If you didn’t find me physically attractive, then it would have been irrational for you to go out with me in the first place. After all, our first date was not a blind date. You already knew what I looked like before our date.
Perhaps, you’re unimpressed that I manage my family’s investments and my own investments. Perhaps, you don’t think I have a “real” job. Well, I’ve done very well as an investment manager. I’ve made my parents several millions of dollars. That’s real money. That’s not monopoly money. In my opinion, if I make real money, it’s a real job. Donald Trump’s children work for his company. Do they have “real” jobs?  I think so. George Soros’s sons help manage their family investments. Do they have “real” jobs? I think so.
In addition, I’m both a right-brain and left-brain man, given that I’m both an investment manager and a philosopher/writer. That’s a unique characteristic; most people aren’t like that.
I’ve never been as disappointed and sad about having difficulty about getting a second date as I am with you. I've gone out with a lot of women in my life. (FYI, I'm not a serial dater. Sometimes, I've only gone out with a woman for one date.) People don’t grow on trees. I hope you appreciate the potential we have.

Am I sensitive person? Sure, I am. I think it's better to be sensitive than to be insensitive. There are too many impolite, insensitive people in the world.

I suggest that we continue to go out and see what happens. Needless to say, I find you less appealing now (given that you haven’t returned my messages) than I did at our first date. However, I would be willing to go out with you again. I’m open minded and flexible and am willing to give you the benefit of the doubt. I wish you would give me the benefit of the doubt too. If you don't want to go out again, in my opinion, you would be making a big mistake, perhaps one of the biggest mistakes in your life.
If you don’t want to go out again, then you should have called to tell me so. Even sending a text message would have been better than nothing. In my opinion, not responding to my messages is impolite, immature, passive aggressive, and cowardly. I spent time, effort, and money meeting you for dinner. Getting back to me in response to my messages would have been a reasonable thing for you to do. In addition, you arrived about 30 minutes late for our date. I’m sure you wouldn’t like it if a man showed up thirty minutes late for a first date with you.

If you're concerned that you will hurt my feelings by providing specific information about why you don't want to go with me again, well, my feeling are already hurt. I'm sad and disappointed about this situation. If you give information, at least I can understand the situation better. I might even learn something that is beneficial.

If you don't want to go out again, that I request that you call me and make a sincere apology for leading me on (i.e., giving me mixed signals). In my opinion, you shouldn't act that way toward a man and then not go out with him again. It’s bad to play with your hair so much and make so much eye contact if you’re not interested in going out with me again.
I have tried to write this email well, but it's not perfect. Again, I'm not trying to be harsh, insulting, patronizing, etc. I'm disappointed, sad, etc. I would like to talk to you on the phone. I hope you will call me back at xxx-xxx-xxxx&gt; (if it’s inconvenient for you to talk on the phone when you read this email, you can let me know via email that you are willing to talk on the phone and I’ll call you). If you get my voicemail, you can a leave a message and I can call you back. Even if you don't want to go out again, I would appreciate it if you give me the courtesy of calling me and talking to me. Yes, you might say things that hurt me, but my feelings are already hurt. Sending me an email response (instead of talking on the phone) would better than no response at all, but I think it would be better to talk on the phone. Email communication has too much potential for misinterpretation, etc.
 
Best,
Mike

Please help.  xpost from r/Assistance",antiqueChairman,2016,533,393,http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/o3wnd/my_little_brother_has_been_lost_in_new_york_city/,"(Update at the bottom)

My name is Jamie, and I'm from Virginia.  My little brother, Ian, ([speaks_for_trees](http://www.reddit.com/user/Speaks_for_Trees)) left on Boxing Day, right after Christmas, to spend New Years in Times Square with some people he didn't know very well.  They spoke another language from him and apparently he felt alienated, and on the 30th he simply... walked away.

[And no one knows where he is.](https://www.facebook.com/groups/185598631539107/)

His last credit transactions were for a $20 Metro card on the 30th and a Burger King transaction we believe was on the 31st.  He had been staying at [640 W 139th St in Harlem](http://imgur.com/lSzRu), with two vietnamese girls and a few people I never met.  My father and I traveled in our family minivan to the city yesterday and visited his apartment.  The girls he'd been staying with had left, and all his bags were left behind.  He left his phone, his wallet, his laptop, his trees, his iPod, and all his money.  He did NOT leave his ID, a jacket, or the Metro card he bought... we believe these items were on him.

We've put up fliers and we've talked to the shelters and the cops but I don't know what else to do.  He has a history of depression and he was in a strange place.  He was an engineer, a redditor, and the most important person in my life.  I need your help.  I realize that this subreddit has only the minutest fraction of the population of New York City subscribed, and even all of reddit combined, all of the INTERNET put together, would not represent a hopeful percentage, but I don't know what to do.

Click the link above to reach the [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/185598631539107/) for the search.  [Here](http://imgur.com/Encpp) is a more recent photo on imgur.  [Here](http://newyorkstatemissingpersons.ning.com/profiles/blogs/ian-burnet-missing-12-30-2011-nyc-139th-st?xg_source=msg_appr_blogpost) is a link about the case on NewYorkStateMissingPersons.com.  [Here](http://www.wtvr.com/news/wtvr-richmond-man-22-missing-in-new-york-since-dec-26-20120105,0,5907142.story) is a newspost about the story. Have you seen this man riding the metro?  Have you seen him anywhere in New York City?  For all we know he got out of town somehow... he could be broke and hitchhiking back down the East Coast to Virginia.  I don't know.

Thank you for listening.  Thank you for anything.

UPDATE: We still havent found him.  Spent all day walking around between subway stations, various parks, and the police station we went to before.  We put up about 70 fliers.  For those of you in Richmond, Virginia this story will be showing up on the local news, Channel 6.  (But the rest of you can watch it [here](http://www.wtvr.com/videogallery/67187066/News/Missing-New-Kent-man))  Spoke with Detective Sanchez, who had been mostly busy today on a different case... we told him everything we know and a lot of things that are purely speculative, but he didnt have much to offer us yet.  Hopefully they'll make more progress tomorrow.

In the meantime, thank you all for your support.  Your help and advice has been extremely valuable to us, and I tried to use as much of it as I could.  I hope Ian and I will someday both get the opportunity to visit your fair city under less dire circumstances.

UPDATE, ONE YEAR LATER: (1/8/13)

Every now and then I get orangered and click to see who replied to whatever comment, and find that it wasn't a reply at all.  It was someone wanting to know if I know anything new.  Most of the time I dont respond, not because I'm offended, but because thinking about it hurts.

Sometimes I do respond, and when I do... I try to be polite.  ...Once or twice, I responded when I'd been drinking, and I wasnt polite then.  Sorry, if you were one of those people.

The answer is no, we still don't know anything.  Yes, Ian is still missing.  I've heard a multitude of theories from family, friends, and total strangers about where he might be.  I've heard it suggested that he ran off to Canada, or that he's hiding in a Buddhist Temple somewhere (he wasn't Buddhist, or anything -ist other than athe), or even part of a Top Secret Government Sociological Experiment.  I dunno.  They all sound equally unreal, as does the reality of the situation.  I don't hurt constantly, because it doesn't feel possible.  It still feels like he's a text message away.  There was no body.  There was no funeral.  And while we had a little ceremony, on his birthday, the truth is that there will never, ever, be closure.

I don't know where he is.  And honestly, I'm not looking.  I don't know where I'd even begin to look.  At this point, if he comes back to us, it will be under his own power.  If that happens, and I hope it does, I'll post and... tell everyone.  Shoot, I'll personally message everyone that's ever asked.  But I'm not expecting that.  Because whether it feels real to me or not, his absence has become part of daily life for us.

Thank you for looking.  Thank you for your prayers.  I'm sorry I dont have good news.",,False,,t5_2qhu2,1357700157.0,,,True,t3_o3wnd,http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/o3wnd/my_little_brother_has_been_lost_in_new_york_city/,

Say something!,fusoyaff3,826,92,174,http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/1j2rrd/a_reminder_from_your_conductor_feel_something_say/,"Tonight on my train, I noticed an unusual number of people running between the 7th car and the 6th&amp;8th. Like almost EVERY single customer who boarded at the 7th car would run to the next car either immediately, or at the next station. So I knew there was something in that car which was driving the riders away. However, not ONE of those hundreds of customers said one word to me about what was wrong in there. According to the NYCT rules of operation, I am prohibited from leaving my position on an in-service train unless I actually have something to investigate - reported to me by either a customer, over the radio, or something I saw with my own eyes. So I had to assume it was probably a smelly homeless guy who made the car into his home, and unfortunately NY has a law that you can't refuse service to someone simply for having an offensive odor, so if that was the case there was nothing I could have done except tell the other customers to ride in a different car if they were bothered. So since nobody was speaking up, I was forced to ignore it.

When my train got to the terminal, I went back there to see what the problem was. It turned out that one of the Air Comfort circuit breakers had tripped, and it was an oven in there (this would be caused by the heat being on full blast, due to a malfunctioning thermostat thinking it was -80 in there instead of 80). It was literally a 30 second fix to get the Air Comfort working again, and within a couple minutes that car would have been as cool as the rest of the train.

The point of this story - if even ONE of those customers on my train had knocked on my cab door or came to my window at a station, even if it was the station they were getting off at, and said ""hey, there's a hot car back there"", then that would have been all I needed to hear in order to go back there and reset the Air Comfort immediately, redistributing the passenger load among 8 cars rather than 7 and giving EVERYONE a more comfortable ride.

TL;DR: If you're on a subway train and there's a hot car, TELL THE CREW so it can be fixed!",,False,,t5_2qhu2,False,,,True,t3_1j2rrd,http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/1j2rrd/a_reminder_from_your_conductor_feel_something_say/,

Edit2: [tralfamadorFTW writes](http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/jrweu/earthquake/c2enlqn?context=3),

&gt;I work with Professional Geologists, so we congregated around a geologic map of VA (we have one for every state), and discussed why it was so large, and so widely felt. See the attached diagram I made. The quake occurred on a fault that is oriented SW/NE (like most on the east coast) between an ancient granite/quartz formation (1 billion years ago), and a less ancient sedimentary formation (0.5 billion years ago).

&gt;Anyway... the less ancient formation shoots straight up to DC! This is why it was so intensely felt, even for being only 75 miles away.

Just had to vent. ,Ian277,925,259,234,http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/kuddz/denied_publicly_on_the_train_just_had_to_vent/,"I jumped on the L train into the city this past Friday and ended up standing next to a gorgeous girl sitting down next to me. I was on my way to work blasting ELO on my ipod (something like that to get me pumped up for work)  and noticed this girl looking at me. She had her headphones on and gave me a smile and I did the same. That’s when I decided I had to ask her out, but how to do it without being publicly embarrassed on a packed train? So I took out my phone and wrote “how about a cup of coffee sometime?” on my evernote app. 

At this point, my hearts beating very hard as I’m half way to asking her out in front of everybody and not sure I can do it.  We hit 3rd Ave and I’m running out of time, so I say fuck it, and as “living thing” is blaring in my ears I get here attention, hand her my phone silently indicating she read it. She reads it, smiles, looks at me still smiling and yells – “I WOULD BUT I HAVE A BOYFRIEND! SORRY! BUT I HAVE A BOYFRIEND!” and hands me my phone. I, in panic mode, scream back – “OK, IT WAS WORTH A SHOT!”. Both of us still wearing headphones and blasting music on the train. It happened so quickly and I didn’t realize we were both yelling until I look around and mostly everyone is either laughing or clapping. Some big Italian guy pats me on the back and in a drowned, muffled deep voice I can hear him say – “The kids got bualls! (laughing)”

This all happened from 3rd ave to 14th street and as we approached 14th, I looked down at the girl and she was bright red and put her head down in embarrassment. The only thing I could think to do was shrug my shoulders and say – “whoops, my stop” and hopped off. I was super embarrassed and the big Italian guy followed me off the train patting me on the back as  people were still clapping and laughing. I decided to walk the rest of the way to 8th street. 

TL/DR - Tried to be discreet and ask girl out on train using text on phone  - both ended up yelling out responses cause we were both wearing headphones.

Edit: Wow, I didn't think you guys would react in such a positive way. I just thought this was an embarrassing story I had to get off my chest. I get on at the Graham L stop and head to 8th ave every morning. And I'm 28, which I think makes it even more embarrassing because the whole interaction was so juvenile. Thanks for such support! I'll think of all these comments every time I'm about to get on the train.

I recently visited New York City the other day. I live in Ithaca and the police departments compared to one another are very different. I was visiting a friend who lives in Morningside Heights. A predominate number of my NYC friends are caucasian. The night progresses, drinks are consumed, spontaneous ideas were exchanged. Around 1:15 A.M, five of us (me and another female being the only black ones) all left the house and proceeded to make our way to another friends house. Someone mentions that they've forgotten their purse. The other two offer to accompany her back to the house to retrieve it. Myself and my friend (the only other african american) just decide to wait on the sidewalk for them to come back, we had only been walking for about five minutes and weren't far.

Very bad idea.

about 10 minutes after they leave, we notice a black car, slowing creeping towards us eventually parking a couple of yards behind us. We try and ignore it and I reach in my pocket for a cigarette. As I start to light it, two cops exit their vehicle and approach us. I puff on my cigarette, TRYING to make is painfully obvious that its a cigarette. Two white officers than proceed to ask us for our ID's and what we were doing out so late.

My friend (who was very annoyed with the situation) states that she is a capable twenty year old adult woman who does not have to explain why she's out on her own accord at night. She also asked why they stopped us.

The officers ignored the question and focused their attention on me. They asked if I had any drugs on me or if I'd been doing anything I shouldn't of been doing. I told them no.

One of the officers made a remark after viewing my drivers license, My mother lives in a very affluent community in the hamptons and that is the home address on my ID. She is african american.

The officer remarked: ""Are you sure this is your home address? Seems a little bit beyond your means."" At this point, I got infuriated and asked if we were being detained and if not could they please politely fuck themselves. (that was verbatem) the officers became clear agitated and asked for us to empty our pockets. We did and they were empty. 

At this point, our friends were on their way back. Upon seeing us being confronted by two officers, one of them quickly asked what the officers were doing

The officers asked if them if they knew us to which they replied yes. He quickly let us go and left with his partner. I am absolutely positive I would've received some kind of ticket had my (white) friends not returned. I feel violated. It felt almost like how black people weren't allowed to be in public without a white man accompanying them. It felt dehumanizing and just pissed me off so much.

So reddit, What can/should I do?

EDIT: I'm sorry you think it's a troll thread. If I had more time I would definitely divulge the entire story with a lot more details but this is the gist. I should've just done an audioclip where I just ranted. I'm not planning on sending a fucking letter or trying to get on the news. It's simply a waste of time. To avoid these blatantly racially biased stop and frisk tatics, I will simply stay out of new york city, I don't live there I have no family there. It isn't really problem. It just kind of sucks, ya know? 

EDIT 2: I'm not looking to press charges? I don't know who the cops were, didn't get a badge number or anything. I never planned on pressing charges, I did however come on here to express how I felt. I am happily back in Ithaca. Congratulations New York City.

This was her second bout with cancer, the first being back in 1998, when she fought and recovered, at least for a bit. We aren't particularly religious people, and mom never wanted a large ornate funeral; her one wish that she expressed more than once, was to have a large train of cars in her funeral procession. ""When I go, I want you to stand on the corner and convince people to show up for me."" 

Mom's funeral service is going to be tomorrow, Wednesday January 9th at 12:30 in the afternoon at Schwartz Brothers Memorial Chapel at 114-03 Queens Blvd in Forest Hills. The burial is going to be at the Huntington Rural Cemetery in Huntington Long Island. If you've got nothing to do tomorrow afternoon and want some real life karma, please come out. 

Thanks.

***edit added and date fixed
OP here; 
first, sorry for the blunder. As my dad has pointed out, Wednesday is January 9th. Nice; sorry, I'm a little bit overwhelmed right now.
second, it's definitely real. You can check the Sloan Kettering giving page if you like - I think I'm not supposed to post her name (mods, can I ?) or anything like that, but it's definitely real. 
third, yeah, it's a bit odd, I admit. Mom didn't necessarily want anyone to attend the service or burial (and I really would advise against it - life can be sad without attending funerals of random strangers) - she just wanted to avoid having a funeral procession of one or two cars and instructed me to get people to just follow. I think my mom wasn't quite aware of how many caring friends and family members she has - the outpouring of sympathy and concern has been quite astounding so this may all be overkill. But part of me thinks it'd be nice to have a flash-procession (like a flash mob). Mom would be psyched.

So... take it for what you want. It's real.

I'm a Asian foreign student who is now engaged to my lovely boyfriend - who is white. My loving and protective Korean mother does not know any of this, and I have (unfortunately) been lying to her for nearly a year now. Amongst a slew of other issues/lies involved here regarding faking my activities in New York (this story only goes deeper), she is now sending my brother to NYC for the first time to visit me, and check up on me. He is arriving in the next few days to stay until the end of October. I have convinced my mother and my brother that my boyfriend's friend left town for work for a few weeks, and just so happens to be the same time my brother is coming, and is able to hook us up with his apartment to stay at. 

Unfortunately, my mother and brother both want to see my 'apartment' that I live in, in which I have told her I have female roommates in a 2/3 bedroom apartment. I will have to take my brother to this mysterious apartment in the next few weeks, albeit for just an hour to look around to make sure I'm doing good in the big city. 

I'm offering $100 to anyone, preferably female in a 2/3 bedroom apt with other female roommates, to let me use their room for an hour to pretend it's mine. It has to be furnished but doesn't need anything special since he doesn't know what furniture I have, would just bring along a school textbook, picture and what not. Extra cash for pretending to be my roommate!

1338071731.0,392,self.nyc,u6j2x,Today I was at the Green Market in Union Square when I heard screeching tires and a loud bang...,v3ra1ynn,458,66,101,http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/u6j2x/today_i_was_at_the_green_market_in_union_square/,"It happened only about 20 feet from where I was, I didn't see it, but it was obvious that someone got hit by a car, and hard. Instantaneously, I put down the bag I had in my hand and ran over to the scene. A few people were already yelling ""call 911!"" I looked down and saw the male sprawled on the ground, flailing around like a fish out of water...his head was bleeding profusely and there was already a good amount of blood gathering on the ground. Everyone was just staring in fear, what can we do?

As soon as I saw the blood, I knew something had to be done, and quickly. He was losing it fast, he had a fist sized gash in his forehead where his head hit the windshield of the taxi and all of his skin was torn up.

I looked around once more at everyone dumbfounded, quickly took my shirt off, folded it up, knelt down beside him and applied it to his hemorrhaging wound, keeping pressure on it with my hands, while trying to keep his head slightly tilted up and braced so he didn't further hurt it. 

I was scared for him, but was telling him(and myself), that he was going to be okay. Head wounds bleed a lot, but I didn't know exactly how bad it was.

Another lady knelt down to hold one of his hands trying to comfort him and asking him questions. I think he was a bike messenger.

Very quickly there was a crowd around us, cops also showed up pretty fast. I kept on holding my makeshift bandage against his head, the blood was coming through already. 

I didn't have a very good grasp on how much time was passing, but it seemed like about 7 minutes before a firetruck showed up with an EMT. He came up to me and he had gauze in his hand, ready to take over. I stepped back. And that was it.

I didn't stick around to see what happened, it was out of my control at that point and he was in better hands. I was on the clock and had to figure out how I was going to get another shirt. But it was a miniscule sacrifice that I'd be willing to make again in a second to possibly save someones life. There was no way I was going to let him bleed like that for 7 minutes.

I just wish I knew the outcome, he has to be okay. I've always been a casual lurker here, everyone knows there's hours of entertainment, and madness. 

But I thought by posting my story, that maybe I could inspire some people, and furthermore, find out what happened to this guy. The whole thing shook me up pretty good, it moved me. I was once hit by a car, laying on the ground helpless, in so much pain, in a different world. There was some kind of sick connection. I want to know.

We found Bagel, thanks in part to our friends in /r/nyc! After a grueling 15 hour search, a neighbor contacted us after seeing her land in their backyard across the street from us. Her story actually resulted in some coverage of how Reddit and the community helped find her (see the article on [The Daily Dot](http://www.dailydot.com/lifestyle/reddit-lost-parrot-bagel-jennifer-wong/)) As requested, here is a timeline of the events that transpired from when she was lost Saturday night, to Sunday afternoon. 

**tl;dr: Lost our African Grey Parrot at 11pm on Saturday 6/22, found her thanks to a great effort by the community, friends, and Reddit on Sunday afternoon!**

Please keep your birds on a harness whenever you take them out!!! We learned our lesson the hard way, with a fortunate ending!

**Bagel's Night Out**

It is Saturday evening and we are having a little get-together with friends. We are on the roof with Bagel, a young African Grey Congo parrot that comes outside with us frequently. Despite Jenn’s warning not to bring her up there as she had recently become more and more brazen, I brought her up there to be with the rest of us on a gorgeous summer evening. Bad idea.

**11 PM:** Bagel gets startled as I prepare myself to go down the roof hatch to our 4th floor townhouse apartment. The combination of the glowing light and my sudden drop in preparation for descending the ladder is enough to spook her into flight. I am overcome with shock and fear as my poor baby is out on her own in Clinton Hill, into uncharted territory made up of densely-packed townhouses and towering century-old trees. Bagel has never flown more than the length of our apartment, usually breaking her fall in a pile of clothing or a duffel bag that we put against the wall to soften the landing. This time, she takes off into the night on a trajectory that takes her around the corner onto Fulton Street, where we lose sight of her darting away along the rooftops of Brooklyn. My heart drops as I jump down the hatch, bruising my knees as I scamper down to the street in the direction of her flight. 

**11PM - 2AM:** We canvas the immediate location with our friends who were over to enjoy a night of drinking and relaxation, quickly becoming a makeshift search party in shock at what just happened. Parrots do not fair well in the dark, as their eyesight limits them to essentially going to sleep immediately when the light is out. We know that we have to be lucky to find her, as she would most likely take cover and wait out the evening until daylight. This does not stop us from scouring the streets shouting “Bagel!” and causing many people to stare and react negatively to our desperate calls.

[Drunk dude screaming ""BAGEL!!"" On the streets of Clinton Hill.](https://twitter.com/itsjonmackey/status/348662432366993408)

**2 AM:** We grab a Zipcar and head to our friend Jay's house, to print out posters that we haphazardly made. Jay's printer was malfunctioning so we decided to head to the closest 24-hour FedEx Kinko's, all the way in Manhattan at 49th St in Midtown East. During the drive, all we could think about is how little of a chance we had for recovering her, as she would certainly be lost in the night and our only hope would be getting as many people possible to be aware of our situation. As we headed into the city, all I could think about was how she was out there, alone in the night, and we were heading away from her. With no other options, we tried to reassure ourselves that she would likely stay put in the area.

**3:30 AM:** FedEx Kinko's can only read jpgs from a USB drive? We upload the image to Google Drive using the iPhone App, and re-save the image from our link on Imgur. Surprisingly the copier has a Google Drive interface that works moderately well (seeing all your files on a tiny touch LCD was interesting) and we are able to print a couple hundred copies in 30 mins.

**4:30 AM:** After debating taking a two-hour nap we decide we cannot lose any time and start putting up posters. We run into a man on Clinton and Gates who tells us he heard a distinct bird calling out at two blocks over. As we start running east down Gates, another man who overheard our discussion stops us and tells us he saw a ""beige cat"" chasing a grey bird from a house on Clinton through a backyard over towards Waverly. His description rings true as he describes her hurried waddle/scurry, our search taking a grim turn from looking for our bird to looking for blood and feathers. We spend a good hour looking around the area with him, until the man shows me a text typed out on his phone asking for money for baby formula. We realize he may just be leading us on for the reward money, although his description was fairly accurate.

**5:30 - 7 AM:** We continued scouring the neighborhood, posting fliers all around and talking to all of the early risers. ""Any chance you see a parrot? She's grey with a beautiful red tail."" At this point we realize that our only hope is to get everyone in the direct vicinity to know about the situation, as the odds of finding a grey bird in a neighborhood full of multifamily townhouses and lush backyards were slim to none for a few sets of eyes and hoarse voices.

**7:00AM:** Jenn returns home to make postings on Craigslist, Reddit, and Facebook. At this point I grabbed my bike to be able to cover more distance, patrolling up and down a radius of about 4 blocks in every direction from where we saw her fly. Being a young bird with flying experience limited to a Brooklyn-sized apartment, we knew if she was safe that she couldn't be far. Our biggest fear was that she would be hunkered down in a tree and would be impossible to find even if we were in the right backyard. That, and feral cats. At this time I saw a woman taking a photo of our flier. Turns out she is the Block President of the area, and she emailed a list of 100 or so people in the neighborhood for us with a description and photos of our flier. I start posting fliers up at local businesses which are beginning to open up.

**9 AM:** Sightings start coming in. We receive an email from a Craigslist responder saying that they purchased our bird on a bus from NY to VA. Bullshit! but we respond anyways, curious what kind of scam this guy is pulling. Sightings and suggestions start trickling in via email, Reddit and people on the street who have seen our sign. Now that the neighborhood is beginning to wake up, our strategy shifts to asking people we see leaving their apartments if we can go up on their roof or check out their backyard for our lost bird. People are generally sympathetic to our situation, and let us in. We spend sometime on the roof deck of 525 Clinton, which allows us a grand view of the surrounding blocks where we diagram the possible areas she may be in. Jenn believes that Bagel must've made a sweeping U-turn the way she was headed, my belief is that she made an S-curve after turning on Fulton. We mapp out all of the possible yards and private areas we need to get into and search.

**11 AM:** an email from ""Sbarnes"" spots Bagel flying over a school, near her last sighting on Waverly. 

&gt;""My husband might have seen her this morning heading from Waverly towards Washington Ave. over PS 11. It happened very quickly, so he wasn't sure it was a parrot. We will be watching.""

We are ever so hopeful as the two sightings match up back to back. Bagel is flying east across Clinton Hill. Hopeful that she is alive, but at the same time, our search area begins to expand and the haystack is growing.

**12 PM:** Our friend Alex comes to join the search. Alex stayed with us last summer when he was interning at Bellevue, so we were especially grateful because he had spent a lot of time with Bagel and she would recognize him if they crossed paths. We take a short break over a deli sandwich with no appetite on our stoop, and resume the rooftop searches sifting through private yards. 

**2PM:** Jenn heads back to the apartment to reach out to bloggers and the media. I return to the area that bagel was last seen, speaking with all the people in the park nearby the school. With every tree that I search my hope dwindles knowing that our chances are incredibly slim finding a lost bird protecting herself in the wild. I approach a woman with three dogs who tells us that she saw our sign, and had a birdfeeder up in her front yard hoping to attract Bagel. 

**2:30PM:** Jenn receives a phone call about an orange bird in a backyard across the street from our apartment. 

""Hold on let me check again. You're right, she's grey!""

Skeptical, Jenn calls me to go check it out. I gun it from 6 blocks down, exhausted from the day but ever so hopeful that there is a chance Bagel could be found. My mind is racing that even if it is her, there is a good chance that she may have flown away or will take off if she was to be approached by a stranger. I get to the building, a teenaged boy is sitting on the steps.

""Do you have her? Can I see her?""

He let's me through the garden level entrance, where I cautiously enter not knowing what to expect. If Bagel really is in this backyard, I must not startle her and have her dart away. Stepping into the kitchen, I'm greeted by several members of the family. 

""Look out the window! She's right there!""

I glance out the window to a backyard lush with foliage, searching far and wide for a Bagel.

""She's RIGHT THERE!""

I narrow my focal point. There she is. Sitting right outside the window. I was looking so hard my eyes went right behind her to the tree line. ""BAGEL!!"" I open the backdoor slowly as to not startle her, and her eyes light up as she jumps to my shoulder.

**REUNITED!**

Jenn's shows up with our Celltei bird carrier and the happiest face I have ever seen. We cannot believe our luck and bring Bagel back to our home for the meal of her lifetime and water from her favorite Saratoga Springs glass bottle. I head back down to our friends who found her, to give them a check for the well-earned reward money. Terrence is so grateful, telling me that this reward will help him and his family so much. I give his wife a big hug and tell them they are my heroes.

**Victory Lap**

I take my bike around the neighborhood, taking down any sign that I can see. During this time, I see several people looking at the signs as I tear them down. ""Did you find her??"" YES! UNBELIEVABLE! I stop by a few of the homes of the people who went out of their way to help us. To the couple in apartment #504, who shouted for joy so loud I could hear them from above when I relayed the news over the door buzzer. To the doorman on Clinton Ave that I biked by and fist pumped, to which he responded by jumping up with joy from his desk. To the birthday party at PS 11 who screamed with happiness when I told them the great news. To Eric, Phillip, Suzanne, Anna, Azita, Renee, Patricia, Denise, Atanas, Zach and everyone who let us into their homes and their lives, all banding together to help us find our poor lost bird. I've never felt such a great sense of community and a love for my wonderful neighbors. What a crazy adventure, I can only imagine what this was like through Bagel's eyes.

I am not complaining about gentrification -- gentrification happens. I am complaining about the fact that we have watched Bloomberg turn this city into an economic tourist trap where transience is awarded, landlords get away with rat problems, overpriced produce is bruised,  stores don't even turn on their fucking fridge -- I have bought three -- THREE packs of moldy cheese in the last week. THREE! 

Ok. This is a bit ranty. I know the obvious snarky response would be: Well move. Sure, I may be able to move elsewhere and get a job. I don't want to, this is my home, I am a taxpaying citizen, and furthermore, there are people who *can't.* 

/rant

Edit 1: Holy fuck wow, thanks for your responses! I wrote this with a momentary fury - a primal response from looking at my ConEd bill. I did not know so many people would get involved (and subsequently school me on microeconomics.) We can talk economics as much as we want, but economics is not a philosophy. We can, through policy, shift market incentives that may make living in this town more sustainable. My point about produce: im not just whining over a bruised apple, it is that this apple cost me $2, and that a decent grocery store with a fair price point has no place to be in the city, it is an unsustainable business model.

The city needs to either drop the costs to landlords, through taxes, water, electricity delivery. Or subsidize to say the least. They need to subsidize the rents of people who are *middle class* as well. Cities are beautiful things, cities keep our carbon footprint lower exponentially from those of the suburbs. Bastions of creativity.

But a lot of times it is a Banana Republic

Original message, 6/29/2013

Photo: *removed* 

Location: Webster Hall, NYC. Around 2 AM on 6/29/13

I'm posting on behalf of a friend. Apparently the thief took a selfie, and it went up to my friend's photostream. The phone has since been turned off, and geolocation was always turned off on the phone, so there's no ""find my iphone"" and no geotags available.

She typed up a bunch of details, which you can find below. Everything you see below are her words, not mine. Anyone recognize him? Any tips on how to proceed?

---
DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHO THIS MAN IS? This thief groped me and stole my phone while I was out in NYC last night. I didn’t realize until several minutes later. He texted my friend from my phone, saying that he’ll mail the phone back if I put $400 in his PayPal account.

When I checked my iCloud to recover my phone pictures, I found this picture of this disgusting guy! ( *removed* ) I’m not a Redditor myself, but I’m taking the advice of my friend, “Put that shit on Reddit, lol, I guarantee you’ll find him.” So please help me out!!

Here are some extra details for you all:

Incident details:

- Phone: iPhone 5.
- Location: Webster Hall, NYC. Around 2 AM on 6/29/13
- My phone was in my back pocket. I felt a guy rub against my butt while he was walking by me, and that’s when my phone was stolen.


Tracking efforts:

- I had location tracking disabled on my phone, so using Find My iPhone won’t work, and the photo has no geotag.

- Verizon tried but could not track the location from which the text message was sent.
- He sent me that single text message and stopped responding. He then turned the phone off, so I do **not** have his PayPal information.
- Therefore, this photo is the ONLY available evidence and way of finding him. *removed*

- I’ve suspended the phone and reported it to Verizon as stolen.

- The photo was taken this morning, 6/29/13, at 11:30 AM.
- I’m going to the police today to turn in his picture.

I’ve personally never used reddit, but a bunch of friends suggested it to me. One of them said, “Put this on reddit. The internet usually finds people faster than the police.”

So I wonder, is the internet and social networking really faster and more effective than the police now? It’s worth a shot! I guess we’ll see.

Thanks in advance to the Redditors on here. I really appreciate any help!

Last night after a LONG shift interning at NY Presbyterian, Melody got on the train to relax and head home.
 
Suddenly after the train had left the station, there was a bit of a commotion, and the conductor made an announcement asking for a nurse or doctor to come forward. Melody rushed to the scene.
 
There was a large guy on the floor of the train, unconscious. She did what she was suppose to, and got to work giving the guy CPR. 
 
She worked, and worked and worked. The guy lost his pulse. A med tech came along and helped and another nurse showed up to help Melody keep giving CPR to the guy, they kept going and going.
Eventually the train got to the first stop at Harlem, and some paramedics eventually got to the scene. Melody and THE OTHER GIRL other nurse were still there giving CPR, both fully exhausted, but still going.
 
After some more sophisticated medical technology and personal arrived, and thanks to the quick action and tireless work, the man's life was saved.

I bought some kombucha - with Chia seeds! - and it turned out to have gone bad. It exploded all over me when I opened it, and tasted like balsamic vinaigrette, and the clerks at Sunac refused to let me exchange it. 

 So I stood at the checkout, gradually getting more and more frustrated, louder and louder, until I was making a fully-fledged scene, waving my kombucha in the air, comparing it with other bottles so they could note the color difference, and generally shouting and flailing until they reluctantly allowed me to exchange my precious $5 drink. 

So congratulations New York, you win.

Apparently, a woman in the next car over had a DEAD BABY in her stroller that she was pushing around.  The infant was flopping around in the carriage, head rolling around ect, as a man from that car told me.  He also said the car smelled of decomposing flesh, not the usual subway stench.  She claimed that it was a doll, but clearly it was a dead child.  Someone pressed the emergency button and a policeman boarded the train at 1st ave.  She was escorted out with the dead baby in tow and I could see the allegedly dead baby, with toys all around it, flopping around in the carriage.

He punched her hard. A skinny little hipster named Adam jumped in between them and tried (unsuccessfully) to rescue the girl by taking the punches. She caught one right in the temple and went down. The guy ran away. I called the cops and stayed with the girl and held her hand while she was down for the count; a random passerby who was a doc came and did his 'I'm a hero checking her vital signs' routine... and best of all - when the cops and EMTs came, they had the guy who punched her.. How? Random people on the street (like us) had grabbed him as he tried to get away and held him till the cops came - me and Adam high-fived when we found that out. A total group effort. Adam said 'This is why l love NY!'. Me too.
Here's a kind of closing thought on this topic: To those who say that the view of NY as a place where people (at least some of the time) come together to help each other is delusional... I'd reply: our beliefs influence our actions, which then help to create a city that is in line with those beliefs. At least some of the time. Which is better than none of the time.

Okay.   I thought about this very carefully and I really started to worry about making 4300 people come into midtown manhattan on Sunday night, which is just when the stormatron 5000 is supposed to crush our empire.  Things i worry about include that Mass transit might shut down in all of New york, at 7pm tomorrow, stranding everyone who comes to the shows and that the second show ends at midnight, sending people back home just as it's starting to pick up.

I know that a lot of people are excited to come and they are fine with taking the chance but I really don't want a pole to smash your face in because you saw some comedy.
So i asked the City Center (where the shows are supposed to happen) if we could find another date for tomorrow's shows and they gave me March 2nd.  The City Center, being really cool, has agreed to let us do the shows on that night and your tickets that you now hold will be honored on that night.  the same seat, same everything.  If you can't come on that night, we will either do another show soon after that, or find another show for you in the area in the future.  Or you still have the option to get a full refund for your ticket.  If you already asked for a refund, we can reinstate your ticket if you want to go to one of those shows.

Listen.  I know that probably tomorrow it's going to be a starry clear night and the trains are going to be just gliding up and down the traks and a baby zebra is going to whinny as he trots by the City Center on a night that is going to break records for being placid and perfect for a night of comedy.  And I'm going to feel like an asshole.  And I know that some people had their plans set and are going to be pissed off at me.  I know.  but I also know that some of you are struggling with whether to come in or miss the show and this is the closest I can get to a solution.  You don't have to take a chance and you don't have to miss the show.  Just come see me in a few months.

If it's any consolation, I'm eating a pretty staggering fee for cancelling the show.  But I can take it.  What I can't take is the thought that there's  a CHANCE 4300 people will be in danger trying to get home from my stupid show.

Please email xxxlly@xxxx.com and tell us what you want to do, and ask any question you have.

So that's that.  Cancelled.  Rescheduled.  Please forgive me.  Please be safe.

Your dumb friend

Louis CK

----------------------------------------
Learn the Lingo  
""Winged"" X bedroom - What, is my apartment a fucking a Pegasus? If my apartment is ""winged"" it better fly my ass to fucking work every morning, and take a dump on my ex boyfriend's car. No, what they mean by this is that your apartment does not have a living room. A winged three bedroom is actually what in every other city/country is a two bedroom with a living space. Ah New York, the only civilized city I know where Lebensraum is a luxury, not a right.  

""Railroad style"" - Prepare to have your shame publicly broadcast to your roommates.  

""Boxed bedrooms"" - Shit ain't got closets. Which is great, because it's not like you OWN THINGS.  

""Small"" - I know I'm in for a doozy if they admit to the apartment being small. I clam up and get a feeling of GNAWING FEAR in my stomach as I a brace myself to be lead through what is nothing short of an urban habitrail. Throw in a wheel and some food pellets and I'll sign the lease today!  

""Steps away from XYZ"" - Hyperbole at its finest. Fucking Kobe Bryant steps, maybe. On an island roughly the width of Roman Polanski's rape vacation fortress, ""steps away"" can literally be used to describe anything. In Brooklyn, I am ""steps away"" from Manhattan. In Chinatown, I'm ""steps away from the East Village."" On avenue D, I'm ""steps away"" from a comfortable place where I don't have to worry about getting mugged and sexually assaulted.  

Avenue C - Probably closer to D.  

Between avenue B and C = Avenue C  

Perfect for students = perfect for broke people who can't afford anything but shit.  

""Exposed brick!"" - Do people actually like exposed brick? ""You know, this apartment would be SHIT if wasn't for all this EXPOSED BRICK. I'LL TAKE IT!""  

Kitchen = living room with a stove in it.  

Living room = hallway with a stove in it.  

dishwasher = this is a typo. What they meant was gangbanging bedbugs.  

backyard = an outside-ish space full of garbage from previous tenants where you can contract west nile.  

""huuuuuuuuuge, sick deal, best, roof partay!, sweeeeeet"" - empty words used by foreign Borat-lookalike brokers to lure naive young people into looking at shittacular apartments.  

Williamsburg = Bushwick.  

East Williamsburg = Really fucking Bushwick. Bushwack'd Bushwick.  

Tell me, brokers, how far east does Williamsburg extend? The grand stop on the L? Or perhaps the Balkan mountain range?  

2. Pets. You have four categories for pets.  
1\. Pets ok: this is like finding a fucking hundred dollar bill in a garbage bin of medical waste.  
2\. Pets not ok: at least they're honest. Dicks, but honest.  
3\. Pets on a case by case basis: BRINE SHRIMP and Tamagotchis ONLY.  

3. 5th floor walk-up: the stages of grief  
1\. Denial: Guys, this will be great for us! We'll get extra exercise and the view is great!  
2\. Anger: WTF DID THEY PUT IN ANOTHER FLIGHT OF STAIRS? AND DID THIS STAIRWAY GET NARROWER?  FUCK YOU, STAIRS (multiply this x INFINITY if you are moving things).  
3\. Bargaining: Ok, I'll meet you halfway down the stairs to give your keys. That's the best I can do.  
4\. Depression: This usually entails me crying and eating Popeye's at the bottom of the stairs and debating on sleeping on the floor.  
5\. Acceptance: You were a bad idea. I regret you, and will never make this mistake again.  
6\. Teleportation while drunk: How did I get up here? I can't even fucking walk, let alone climb 10 FLIGHTS OF STAIRS.  
  
4\. Let's Talk Brokers  

Broker Fee: at least they're being upfront about the fact they're trying to rob you.  
Negotiable fee: ""lolz i want money but i'm desperate so...let's work something out where you still feel violated and i can go get bottle service at da club, k?""  
No fee: this apartment is shit. Take it and some waffle fries FO' FREE.  

""Oh, I'll just call this one broker to see a specific apartment and won't let them sucker me into seeing other crap.""  
This was me a year ago--nubile, naive, and ready to keep my options open. Take into consideration the following things: 1. this apartment does not exist. It is a mirage. There is probably a nice Yuppie couple living in the apartment in those pictures. They're probably paying 3x whatever you are willing to pay, and that apartment was never available in the first place; it was only posted to lure you into going to their sketchy broker company, signing a contract (and signing away your legal right to rent any of the apartments you see at their real, un-inflated cost). Let it go and move on.  

""Oh, that apartment wasn't available but you'll show me other ones just like it in my price range? That can't be too bad!""  
Brace for inevitable shit show. This includes apartments HUNDREDS of dollars outside your price range, miles outside your location, vermin-infested dumps, apartments in the initial fuck phase of renovation, etc. All these can be yours and more for the low brokerage fee of one month's rent. Once you sign that stupid contract KILLSELF is the only option. Especially once you see the same apartment you looked at for 600 dollars lower than the broker advertised and you can't rent it because you're legally bound to a pile of shenanigans and horse apples.  

Almost every apartment being shown by brokers (fee or no fee) will be listed by a management company for significantly cheaper and less of a hassle. Not to say that management companies don't suck donkey balls too, but at least you'll get to deal directly with them and not have it mediated through someone whose fucking Devry degree or stand-up comedy career didn't pan out.  

If you see an apartment listed on CL that you like, but it's listed by a broker (fee or no fee), check to see the address. Does it say some steaming bullcrap like ""LOWER EAST SIDE AT MANHATTAN ST.?"" If yes, then the apartment is available for cheaper. PROTIP: if you google-map the address ""Lower East Side at Manhattan Street"" your computer will implode and incinerate you immediately. Less retarded brokers will simply omit an address or just give you the neighborhood as in ""EAST VILLAGE GEM STEPS AWAY FROM --the moon, al gore, my bff jill, etc--""  

5\. You finally find a place you love and apply. You might get fucked over for no reason. A. Someone else might apply for the place who sucks less than you. B. Someone else might be willing to pay more than you. 4. The apartment was never available and they just wanted your application monies. Go home, drink your tears, start search over, repeat.  

6\. A memo to STUYTOWN, PETER COOPER VILLAGE, ETC.:    

Putting a bookcase in the middle of a room does not make it two rooms. I am sick of seeing ONE BEDROOMS listed as THREE BEDROOMS.  

""lol, all u gotta do is put a bookcase here, install a wall here, then put a door in that wall, and then pull out the copy of Milton's PARADISE LOST in the bookcase, thus activating the secret door. Take that path, race up to the observatory, spin the sundial and pass into the room of the golden idols. Once there, push down on their faces to release the doors, that may take you below or lead you into the shrine of the silver monkey.  

Assemble the statue there and you may be headed for the torch room. If the elevator is up, you could jump into the elevator and descend into the mineshaft. You might climb up the ladder or plow through the stone wall. Find the key and it may unlock the tombs of the ancient kings, allowing you to climb into the spider's lair. If you escape, you may have a chance to sit upon the throne of the Pretender. If the correct door is unlocked, you'll be able to crawl into pit of despair and finally make you way through the cave of size, back to the temple gate.  

The choices are yours and yours alone.  
Good luck!""",,False,,t5_2qhu2,True,,,True,t3_iabpt,http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/iabpt/solid_advice_from_a_girl_whos_starting_the/,

As I boarded the train from Spring St to go home about 40 minutes ago, some young men were changing cars at the same time. They were walking through the train car yelling about the protest downtown and urging people to join, while at the same time, provoking those in suits/dressed professionally. Once they got to me in the middle, they chastised me as well. 

Now, I don't think the interview went very well. It was a job that was finally in my major, so I was extra pissed that it turned out a little poorly, partly because I spent most of my night last night cleaning an extra dirty apartment for a little bit of extra money that I need to feed myself. It was at that point, I snapped.

""Why are you bothering me? Shouldn't you be downtown instead of riding the trains? I'm sure enough people know you're down in the Financial District camping,"" I said. One of the three guys screams in my face, ""It's people like YOU that should be down there camping with us! It's people like YOU who put this country in shit! You're probably a one percenter! You don't care about the working class!"" Fighting my urge to smack him in the face with my purse, I stepped off the train at West 4th to avoid getting arrested after the damage I wanted to do to him.

But fucking really? If I don't want to protest, and I am dressed up a little professionally, I'm a one percenter? This sounds like a Tea Party calling those who don't join them ""un-American.""

In the meantime, there is one way members and others can be of immediate help. The Board of Elections urgently needs people to serve as poll workers this Election Day, as the aftermath of the storm has left the City’s Board of Elections seriously short of poll workers for Tuesday, with many people indisposed and many polling places having to be changed. The only requirements are that you be a permanent U.S. resident, a New York City resident, 18 years of age, and that you complete a short training. Poll workers will need to be at their assigned post starting at 5a on Tuesday until after the polls close at 9p. In some locations, that could be up until 11p. There is a $200 stipend for this day’s work.

Training sessions have been set up for tomorrow (Sunday) at 9:30a, 11:30a, 1:30p, 3:30p, and 5:30p, at the Manhattan office of the Board of Elections, 450 West 33rd Street, 8th Floor.. Each training is an hour and a half to two hours. If you are interested, please contact matthew.maddox@davispolk.com, nadia.moore@davispolk.com or daniel.kolb@davispolk.com to express your interest.

Edit:  **You do NOT need to be a lawyer to volunteer.  All you need is to be 18, a NYC resident, and a permanent US resident.  Also the date for the training sessions has passed and there were plenty of volunteers.  Thank you all!**

Edit2: If you are still looking to volunteer **and you are a lawyer OR a law student**  Election Protection still needs volunteers to staff call centers that will receive calls from all over the country. At Davis Polk, we will be receiving all NYC calls. We expect a very large volume because of the storm and polling site changes.
It is just a 1 hour training (that can be done remotely) and a 4 hour shift. There are trainings for that today and Monday. If you’re interested, sign up for a training here -- http://www.866ourvote.org/pages/ny-volunteer-training
Then, sign up for a shift here -- http://www.866ourvote.org/pages/ny-volunteer-shifts

After a bad day I got onto the 4 train heading downtown at 14th street in one of the middle, near-end cars. Thanks to the gray-haired lady (with black headphones, a black shirt, leather bag) who handed me a tissue and offered me a beautiful, sympathetic smile. And to the two young men in the Yankees uniforms (one had a white pin-stripe jersey and a backwards hat, the other was wearing a navy jersey, had sunglasses on at one point, and also was donning a cap).  Thank you for offering your seat and a friendly ear, even though if we didn't talk for more than 2 seconds and you had to jump off to get your stop.

I truly appreciate it, and I truly hope that they know that their generous sympathy is refreshing. Compassionate strangers, I hope I can return the favor someday.

I love New York City.

And it's nice you're in the bike lane.  So am I, riding my skateboard.

But can you please take your headphones off?  I mean, you're wearing studio monitor cover-the-ear headphones in heavy traffic.  You're not in a music video, you're doing the most dangerous thing in the city.  You really, really should take your headphones off.

Or get some earbuds.  Then maybe your helmet will fit.


Edit:  wow, some real animosity below toward skateboarders in the bike lane.  Would you rather have us on the sidewalk bikers?  Sorry, not safe for a longboard going 18 mph.  I understand your frustration, but come on, my issue isn't with bikers and I always yield to them...it's with people wearing huge headphones and no helmets.

Edit #2: While nobody seems sure whether or not skating is legal in the bike lane, I will note that I always ride to the far sidewalk side of the lane, and try to get out of the lane altogether when there are no parked cars.  I think skaters should defer to bikes in the lane, and I also think we can share the lane safely.  If we all wear helmets.  With no earphones in.

* $20 All you can eat sushi

* $30 All you can eat sushi and drink (sapporo, wine and sake)

* Every day: 3 rolls for $10

* $1 Wine, Beer, and Sake Monday-Thursday (WHAT?)



That is all.


I invite other redditors to share thier favorite *secret* cheap places to eat and drink in the city.


**EDIT**: I forgot to mention, I brought a girl here for a date last week. 6 rolls of sushi, 4 drinks, soup, salad, and dessert... I think it was $37 all together. Stupid cheap.

**EDIT #2**:

I'm going to add everything people added in the comments... 

**------------------------------------------**

Favorite cheap place: I don't think it's really a secret, but it's a little off the beaten path, so close enough. There's this place called Prosperity Dumpling on Eldridge between Hester and Canal. It's a total hole in the wall, but the 25-cent dumplings are delicious, and I've never gotten sick from them.

**------------------------------------------**

There's a sister Milk-N-Honey bar, right off the 59th street bridge, called: ""Dutch Kills"" in Long Island City tucked away speakeasy. Fantastic drinks and very unassuming. Bathrooms are even with linens. Guaranteed to impress anyone you are with and not super expensive.

**------------------------------------------**

Hmm, a similar place in Flushing is great too.

All you can eat hotpot, all you can drink Budweiser cans, 26 dollars. Obligatory 2 hour time limit.

The restaurant is called Shanghai Tide and it is a block or 2 from the Flushing 7 train stop.

**------------------------------------------**

Dang lai palace on 17th and 3rd, great food and $15 unlimited sake bombs

**------------------------------------------**

This place, Jin has a ridiculously cheap happy hour...EVERYTHING is 3 dollars from sushi rolls to appetizers to drinks. It's incredible I went here with 6 people and I think our bill was like $60-$70 bucks total. It's from 330-7 on weekdays and 1230-7 on weekends!!! It's at 252 Broome b/t Ludlow &amp; Orchard...

My boy and I are stuck in the city this merriest of holidays, and we'd like to host a potluck Thanksgiving for some redditors. New friends! Or whatever.

We are two twenty-somethings looking to give back to the reddit community. We recently went on a big ol' roadtrip, hosted almost exclusively by random acts of reddit generosity, and we want to pay that favor forward. (If you want to read about our adventures and stalk up on us a bit, [here's our on-the-road-blog](http://redditroadtrip.tumblr.com/).) Anyway, he's a musician, and I'm a classically-trained cook.

I'm gonna be making a fancy, delicious turkey as well as some classic sides (bitches don't know 'bout my brussels sprouts), maybe a pie or two. If you can cook something to share, great! If not, that's okay. Just bring the hooch.

We live in Park Slope, off the F/G. We probably can't host more than ten or so folks, so let us know soon if you wanna get diggety-down with us. And what you're bringing, too! No smallpox, please.

**EDIT:** Alright, folks, we're at capacity. While we'd love to put you all up, our landlady would probably be not-so-thrilled. Thanks for all the nice things you've had to say, and stay tuned for more details. Happy Thanksgiving!

Its an exhibit about bioluminescence in the natural world and costs an extra $22. to see. I hate to kick any museum in the teeth but I felt so cheated by this exhibit that I was motivated to post here and warn people not to waste their money. By all means visit the American Museum of Natural History, the finest Natural History museum in the world maybe? But I am here to tell you that if you pay the extra money to view the Bioluminescence show you are going to feel cheated by the very low production value and poorly conceived presentation in the exhibit. Even if it was free to walk through you would still fault the exhibit for its striking lackluster displays and near total lack of actual examples of bioluminescent critters. Imagine you are given one month and $700 to build an exhibit about this subject so you go to Canal street and buy up a bunch of cheep string lights, rubber creepy crawlers and fluorescent paint and you build a tent with black fabric and aluminum tubes. What I’m describing is EXACTLY what you will see if you go to this exhibit. There ARE plenty of written descriptions of the chemical processes physical structures and evolutionary factors that cause things to glow in the dark, but they are poorly arrayed along the dark winding exhibit and I was left feeling that I could have gained a much better grasp of the concepts by simply reading one concise essay. This was without question the crappiest “special exhibit” I have ever seen at a museum in recent memory.",,False,,t5_2qhu2,False,,,True,t3_x4miu,http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/x4miu/i_just_saw_the_the_creatures_of_light_exhibit_at/,

Fine by me, the new construction looks cool, and the memorial opened recently, so we could go to that.

Little did I know that the memorial is apparently such a dangerous place that extensive screening was necessary.

First thing after I entered, I was randomly selected and pulled aside by a security card and asked for ID. I gave him my expired driver's license - he checked my ID, looked at my ticket, looked at me, and then back at my ID. He says, ""This is expired"". Luckily I had my passport with me, so I gave him that. He looked at it for a few seconds, looked at me, and let me in. I thought that was extensive and ridiculous...

Well it wasn't just an entrance, and then you're in the memorial - there's a pretty lengthy walk with barricades and security or NYPD every 20 feet.

Beyond that, we were finally herded into a small building filled with security and police, so we could go through airport style security. So there I was, wanting to see a simple memorial, and I had to take off my jacket, belt, jewelry, empty my pockets and walk through a metal detector. I have a Leatherman multi-tool that I keep with me regularly, which naturally caused concern. I was pulled aside by security who told me to take it out of my jacket so they could inspect it, but luckily a sensible officer told the guard to just let me through, to which the guard said, ""You better not pull that out in the memorial""

Another German couple wasn't so lucky. They didn't seem to speak very good English and were confused about what was going on. They had a little backpack thing, and two officers kept saying, ""We're going to have to scan this or we can't let you in! If you don't scan it, you can't go in!"" The German man didn't really understand, he thought they were taking his bag, so there was a little grappling match.

I stood there looking around, holding up my pants with no belt and waiting for my stuff to be scanned, and just thought that this was one of the saddest things I'd ever seen in my life.

Probably the first time I felt completely ashamed of my country, I was completely embarrassed that people from other countries were visiting and having to do all this.",,False,,t5_2qhu2,False,,,True,t3_ndyog,http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/ndyog/went_to_911_memorial_the_other_day_and_was/,

It used to be pretty easy to do this, since the MetroCard machines gave you a nice round 15% bonus.  However, now that the bonus has dropped to 7%, if you want to put in an amount that happens to come to an exact even multiple of $2.25, you're looking at the LCD of 107 and 225, which is more money than I ever hope to pay to the MTA in my lifetime.  (Note also that you can only put money into the machine in multiples of $0.05.)

Luckily, the MTA rounds faithfully in terms of calculating the 7% bonus.  As a result, you can exploit this by putting in exactly **$39.95**: after the 7% bonus, you get $42.7465, which is rounded up to **$42.75**, good for _exactly_ nineteen rides.

I wrote a program to pump out these numbers; see below for the full list of MetroCard inputs (up to $100) that results in a sum evenly divisible by $2.25.

I am a NYCT Subway Conductor (yes, I am still working here) and about 14 months ago I did a AMA for reddit. While I was hoping to help inform the redditors of NYC about what actually goes on with our job, it seems the ONLY thing that this group took from it was something I said that got twisted around, and I CONSTANTLY get cited on here for saying something that isn't even true when you read it in the wrong context.

When it comes to injured, sick and dead passengers on the train, ""police investigation"" and ""sick passenger"" are NOT specific code words. A ""police investigation"" code MIGHT mean that somebody just got hit by a train, and it IS the code they use for that, but ""police investigation"" is ALSO the code used for a fight on the train, a fugitive who ran into a subway station, and many other, you know, POLICE INVESTIGATIONS. Just because you hear ""this station is closed due to a police investigation"" it does NOT automatically mean that somebody is under a train. I never said that ""police investigation"" ONLY means person under train.....

As for ""sick customer"", that code is obvious. It can refer to someone having a heart attack, a customer who fell down and hit their head on a bar, or someone who dropped dead on the train (you can only be pronounced dead by a medical professional, so an seemingly unconscious/dead customer is treated as an alive person needing medical attention by the train crew). Either way, if that customer is on the train, the train will be held until EMS (or in some cases during morning rush hour, impatient and in-compassionate customers) can remove that customer from the train. So when you hear ""this train is being held due to a sick passenger requiring medical assistance"" don't just to the conclusion that this sick customer HAS to be dead, because I never said that ""sick customer"" ONLY refers to DEAD customers.

Please try to get it right from now on. No, I'm not answering any more questions. I already had my good name destroyed once.",,False,,t5_2qhu2,False,,,True,t3_14xvsg,http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/14xvsg/ama_nyct_conductor_clarification/,

""By failing to prepare you are preparing to fail.""— Benjamin Franklin

**Facts about Irene:**

* Caused $15 billion dollars in damage
* Killed 47 people in the USA

**Facts about Sandy:** 

* Sandy's Current death toll is at 48

* On Saturday, Sandy became the largest storm in recorded Atlantic basin history, with a diameter of gale force winds of over 1000 miles.
 
* Upon landfall, Irene was a weakening storm. On the other hand, besides the fact that Sandy is expected to be stronger than Irene at landfall, Sandy will still be strengthening. 
 
* As a result of Sandy’s tremendous size and strength, a National Weather Service analysis has rated the storm’s wave/surge destructive potential at 5.7 on a 6.0 scale. This is roughly equivalent to some of the most destructive hurricanes in recorded history 
 
**Preparation:**

* Stay indoors during the hurricane and away from windows and glass doors
 
* Keep all your electronics charged and plugged in. (cell phones, laptops ,rechargeable batteries, tablet ..etc) 
 
* Turn down the temperature on your freezer and refrigerator as low as possible. This will buy you more time in the event of a power loss. 24 to 48 hours before will cool the food. Avoid opening them whenever possible. If you are evacuating, probably unnecessary.
 
* Download an application to your smartphone that can notify people where you are, and if you need help or are safe. The Red Cross has a Hurricane App available in the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store. A First Aid app is also available.
 
* If you have a generator, do NOT run it inside or near the house. But make sure you have fuel to run it.
 
* Keep away from loose or dangling power lines and report them immediately to the power company.
 
* Make sure your car has fuel.
 
* Stay off roads as much as possible
 
* Copies of your important documents in a waterproof and portable container (insurance cards, photo IDs, etc.)
 
* A list of medications you take, why you take them, and their dosages

* Doctors’ names and phone numbers
 
* Use flashlights instead of candles
 
* Whistle, Multipurpose tool
 
* It may sound strange, but do your laundry, dishes, and take a shower. Why? Because if you lose power, having as much clean as possible will make a big difference.
 
* Avoid using the phone except for serious emergencies.
 
* Know your surroundings and whether your home is in a flood prone area. 

* Determine where you would go — and how you would get there — if you were 
ordered to evacuate
 
* Listen to the radio or TV for information
 
* Secure your home, close storm shutters, and secure outdoor objects or bring them indoors
 
* Huge items must even be secured in big storms. An engine block was found 40 or 50 feet up in a pine tree in the Homestead area after Andrew. Don't think that something is too big to be moved by the wind.
 
* Have enough food that you can eat without cooking (because you may lose power) for 4-5 days suggested items including: canned meats, canned or dried fruits, canned vegetables, canned juice, peanut butter, jelly, salt-free crackers, energy/protein bars, trail mix/nuts, dry cereal, cookies or other comfort food.
 
* Make extra ice, bag it - this will be useful to use and to keep the freezer cold.
 
* Have enough water for 4-5 days, One gallon of drinking water per person per day
 
* Ensure a supply of water for sanitary purpose such as cleaning and flushing toilets. Fill the bathtub and other larger containers with water
 
* Know power safety - avoid downed lines
 
* Know food safety - what is good and for how long.
 
* Water treatment - whether water needs to be boiled or not.
 
* Avoid drinking or preparing food with tap water until you are sure it's not contaminated.
 
* Check refrigerated food for spoilage. If in doubt, throw it out.
 
* Have a plan. Discuss possible hazards and procedures with your family, decide on a safe room in your house, identify escape routes and memorize emergency numbers

* Have extra cash on hand

* Regardless of whether or not you are in an evacuation zone, if you live in a high-rise apartment building, be prepared to take shelter on or below the 10th floor.

**If evacuating, bring:**

* Before you evacuate, call at least one person out of state to let them know your plans.
* Leave a note to say where you are going.
* Unplug small appliances and electronics before you leave.
* Checkbooks
* Driver's license
* Credit card information
* Birth certificates
* Social Security cards
* Child care, pet care, and other special items

I hope this helps, Stay Safe!

I am a normal, caring single father of a 4 year old girl. I'm in my late 30's. When I was younger I went to an acting conservatory for college. Got out, decided it wasn't in fact what I wanted to do and started working on computers. Skip ahead 8 or 9 or so years. Have a great job working for a major corporation. About a year and a half ago started having some health issues, lost my job and eventually my home and then my wife left me. I've spent the last year or so trying desperately to work things out with my ex for the sake of our daughter but to no avail.

I am currently on disability and will be attending Brooklyn College in January to work on a Computer Science degree.

In about three weeks I will be officially homeless. Although I am looking for a job I can take on while on disability I have been unable to save enough money for a deposit for an apartment for myself and my daughter.

I don't know if there is anyone out there that has connections that might be able to help get into a place that might be flexible on deposit at least until I can either start a new job or I will have a living allowance once I start back to school in January that I will happily cough up to anyone. 

I also may be able to come up with the deposit immediately with the help of HRA I just need someone that is willing to work with me. HRA needs documentation from the landlord of what I would need to move into a place and when i even mention this when looking for a place it's suddenly not available.

Basement apartment, studio, whatever. I have never felt this alone or this desperate in my life. I don't know where to turn and I've seen reddit do so many amazing things I thought that I might get lucky and one right person may stumble upon this that finds themselves in a position to help out. 

And I apologize for failing to make this as concise as I had hoped.",,False,,t5_2qhu2,False,,,True,t3_xjn5f,http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/xjn5f/im_sorry_if_this_is_in_the_wrong_place_but_i_am/,

Some thoughts from a chef on inspections in nyc.",Cheffie,193,27,67,http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/fckqp/i_just_got_an_a_from_the_health_department_some/,"x-post from [/r/KitchenConfidential](http://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/), a new reddit for restaurant workers.

*I'm Executive Chef of a fine dining restaurant in nyc, just so you know my perspective...*

Everyone with any restaurant experience knows that health inspections are extremely stressful.  During inspection, most managers and chefs are freaking out, causing the rest of the staff to do the same.  For good reason too...not a lot of restaurants survive for long after being shut down for health code violations.  

Last summer NYC changed its system from what was essentially pass/fail to a letter grade system: 0-13 points for an A, 14-27 points for a B, and a C for 28 points and above.  28 points (now a C grade) remains constant as the ""fail""-point, requiring monthly re-inspections until the point total falls below 28 or the restaurant is shut down by the city.  The point system, inspection procedure or regulations didn't change at all...what changed was the letter grading and the added rule that the it had to be posted ""where they can easily be seen by
people passing by.""

And it's a critical change at that.  For every restaurant in the city to be required to post a [giant letter grade](http://i.imgur.com/7kKRp.jpg) from the department of health on the front door is no joke.  I've always run a very clean kitchen...for the benefit of sanitation and of staff discipline.  Even I was fucking scared as hell.  

Why soil ourselves so badly?  

Well, having everyone that's walking in or walking by see a letter grade on your front door or window is a big fucking deal.  Even bigger than most think.  It doesn't matter if people don't know what that grade really means (and they don't).  People will see an ""A"" and feel great about going in.  People will see a ""B"" or ""C"" and the reaction would be anywhere from turned off to being completely disgusted.  The nyc restaurant scene is absolutely cut throat, too many restaurants...and no matter what you're offering, someone else is doing the same.  So, for taco restaurants the competition went from all *restaurants serving tacos* to *restaurants serving tacos that have an ""A"" hanging on their door*.  The other places are irrelevant and cannot compete to make real money and/or survive until they achieve the ""A"".

New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene knows this and it is in fact the point of it all.  They’re working to make restaurants take their inspections  even more seriously or risk going out of business.   Which sounds great to just about everyone too.  But there are a couple of major problems here…

**1) The outcome of health inspections are often unpredictable and depend on a number of uncontrollable factors.**

This. Is. Fact. Ever been to the DMV?  Or the post office?  Or the police station?  I'm not trying say people in civil service are all terrible, I'm saying they're super inconsistent.  One day you go to the DMV and the person is an absolute delight...efficient, friendly, helpful with addressing your concerns.  The next time you get someone who couldn't care less about you and doesn't mind letting you know it.  Or sometimes you get pulled over for speeding and the officer lets you go with a warning.  Other times he/she gives you the ticket while looking for reasons for more, giving you a condescending lecture the whole time.  Not sure why but people in civil service seem to be the most inconsistent workforce anywhere.  Maybe it's the hiring procedure, or the candidates they receive, or the nature of the job and their salaries?  Or maybe they're just as inconsistent as any other group, it's just that we expect them to be otherwise.

Well, health inspectors are civil servants too, and are *wildly* inconsistent.  Some of them are strict and thorough, but use common sense and reason to guide their process making them fair.  Some of them seem to be out to find every single violation or hint of one in an effort to inflict the most damage on your business during their visit.  Some of them don't really care about any of it and breeze through the inspection.  I guess they're human, and the worst of them are technically abiding by the rules stated.  So is the cop that adds on a ticket for not using the turn signal while pulling over.  Just saying that the inspector you draw is a huge factor that you have no control over.

Also, **restaurants are fucking crazy.** Huge places filled with food, employees, customers, garbage, chemicals, fire, water and anything else you can think of.  A restaurant is like a living being and to judge it based on a snapshot taken at a random moment is a problem itself.  Again, we got an ""A"" on our inspection, but I'll tell you right now there were days when we wouldn't have.  The day fruit flies just showed up and decided to make a home in our lounge.  The day the street pipes got all messed up and flooded a corner of the basement.  Or when one of the fridges was running a few degrees warm.  Sometimes one of our 80 employees forgets to label something or the steward misses a dented can and puts it on the shelf with the others.  A million things can and will go wrong on any given day, and of course we deal with them quickly to get everything soignee again. But should you be having a bad day and the inspector arrives, all you can do is scramble a bit and pray you don't get points for it.  Which brings up the other thing...

**2) People have no fucking clue what an A, B or C grade really means.  Meanwhile they're being encouraged to make decisions based on them.**

Decisions that affect small businesses.  Small businesses that each employ anywhere from a handful to hundreds of people.  It's not hard to predict a diner's thought process in relation to health department letter grades.

**I'm only going to restaurants with an A!**

*Um, excuse me.  I'm sorry to bother you but...do you know what the grades really represent?  You know, a B grade actually isn't th...*

**I don't care!  A's are better than B's!  Everyone knows that from years and years of school!!  Why would I go somewhere that's not as good?**

And that diner is right.  There's no reason for anyone to go to any restaurant without that **A**.  On top of that, someone sees a **B** and thinks ""Oh, they didn't get an A.  I wonder why?"", and proceeds to think about rat droppings, cockroaches, fight club, etc and runs away disgusted.

But do you know what makes a **B**?  Well we said already it's 14 points.  Points come from violations.  Some examples (each violation's point value has a range, the inspector is to judge the severity and assign the actual points):

Side towel left on counter top - **5 to 7 points**

Refrigerator above 41°F (even 1°) - **7 to 10 points**

Refrigerator missing thermometer - **2 to 5 points**

Any fly (*food and/or non-food areas*) - **5 to 8 points (28 if it's really messed up like Temple of Doom style I guess)**

Aaaaand we're at around 20 points!  Don't forget that these violations' points sometimes stack too. So for instance, if there's another side towel sitting out somewhere during the tour it would add another 5 to 7 points.  That would put us in **C** territory.  On a side note, having a larger restaurant with more employees is obviously a huge disadvantage.

The point is that the letter grade **doesn't actually mean anything close to what is being perceived.**  How about a 13 point **A** vs a 14 point **B**?  Or two **B**s but one had rotten meat on the hot line and the other got 6 points because a line cook was drinking a cup of water in the kitchen? (Yes, that's a violation)

Here's [Grace Green on Huff Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/19/city-inspections-reveal-n_n_810872.html) with a typical clueless blog post.  She gleefully says that Le Cirque and Gramercy Tavern (large, well known restaurants here) received **C**'s, indicating they had over 28 *violations* which is plain wrong.  28 *points* make a **C**, and we don't know how many violations.  Again, you don't know because you can't tell because the letter grade doesn't have that information.  This is someone writing an article on the subject and still has no idea how the system works and what the grades mean.   The hilarious thing is that they don't mean anything until you investigate the violations.  (You can find full details on each restaurant's inspection [online](http://a816-restaurantinspection.nyc.gov/RestaurantInspection/SearchBrowse.do) but I seriously doubt anyone is going to bother to look past the letter grade)

And so these are the grades that everyone in the city are now judging us on.  And it's a shame.  I'm all for strict health and safety standards for diners and employees everywhere.  But the DHMH didn't think this through before implementation.  It's made slipping on a health code a potential death blow to an entire business and the income of its employees.  

I take great pride in the work I do, as do the vast majority of us in the industry.  Like I said, it's competitive, but that's a good thing.  If you're running a restaurant, no matter who you are or where you work...in this town you're battling guys like Mario Batali, Daniel Boulud, Eric Ripert, Nobu, and Gordon Ramsey every single night to get people into your seats.  The criteria should be the product we work to produce, as a whole.  Certainly our health and safety standards are part of that.
 
But as it is, it's about that damn letter grade first.  Just doesn't seem right.


tl;dr Health inspection letter grades are too vague and arbitrary to have the so large an impact on a restaurant's ability to compete and survive.

We pull into the Grand street station and this guy gets on starts blocking the doors, as if he were holding the train for someone. People keep getting on while the conductor, who sounded like he was near tears, begs whoever is blocking the train to please get out of the way of the door. He was about 10 feet away from me but I was too far away to say anything to him. He was surrounded by a huge group of people who were also irritated, but no one told him to get on or off the train. This literally lasted 10 minutes. Finally, he steps in and the train pulls off.

Next stop, Broadway-Layfayette, he does the same thing. It's clear he's just fucking with everyone on the train because he can. Again, no one says anything, and again the the conductor starts begging for the doors to be cleared so that the train can move.

Finally I walk over to him and get in his face and I say 'Get on or off the train, what are you doing?' He rolls his eyes and continues leaning in between the doors. 'Hey!' I say, stepping closer to him so that there is no space in between us. 'On or off.' He swallows hard and steps in. The door closes. 'Do I actually have to teach you how to ride a train?' I say as a parting shot. He is quiet and embarrassed and the rest of the ride happens in silence. 

The thing is, I am usually sort of timid and the last person that would ever confront someone in front of a large group of people. What I can't believe is how long it took for anyone to do this. On a train full of native NYers, a city that is considered by many as one of the toughest places in the country, why was I (a guy who moved here from MN 3 months ago) the one who had to do this?

Bullshit. A few commenters called it out on his post but they got downvoted to oblivion. I'll chalk that up to white guilt and people not wanting to seem on the wrong side of a race argument. Well, you are.

I'm black. I grew up in Manhattan and Brooklyn and I've dealt with my fair share of shit. I also have a lot of police officer friends both white and black, although a lot more friends on the other side of a jail cell. 

That said, the story this piece of shit made up really drives me crazy. How can we expect race relations to improve when we allow nonsense like this to be taken as gospel? You told a cop to fuck off? BULL SHIT! If anyone did that in NYC, white or black or green, they'd write you up on some jaywalking charge and have you in a jail cell, not run off into the night when they see your superhero white friends coming back.

I also promise you that no cop said ""Well this place seems above your means."" That shit makes the front page of the NY Times if they say it. They're assholes, not morons. They know how to legally fuck with you. (Most of the time.) 

You seem like you're some really rich kid with dreams of being a hoodrat so you made up this story to impress your friends while you were having a smoke and said, well if THEY believe it maybe the internet will too! 

You sir, are an asshole.

Its louis here.  I'm clacking this to you on my phone in my dressing room here at studio 8H, right in 30 rockefeller center, in Manhattan, new york city, new york, america, world, current snapshot of all existence everywhere. 

Tonight I'm hosting Saturday Night Live, something I zero ever in my life saw happening to me. And yet here it is completely most probably happening (I mean, ANYTHING could NOT happen.  So we'll see). 

I've been working here all week with the cast, crew, producers and writers of SNL, and with Lorne Michaels. Such a great and talented group of people.  

And here we are in the middle of New York City, which was just slammed by a hurricane, leaving behind so much trouble, so much difficulty and trauma, which everyone here is still dealing with every day.   

Last night we shot some pre-tape segments in greenwich Village, which was pitch black dark for blocks and blocks, as it has been for a week now.  

Its pretty impossible to describe walking through these city streets in total darkness.  It can't even be called a trip through time, because as long as new york has lived, its been lit. By electricity, gas lamps, candlelight, kerosene.  But this was pitch black, street after street, corner round corner. And for me, the village being the very place that made me into a comedian and a man, to walk through the heart of it and feel like, in a way, it was dead.   I can't tell you how that felt.  And you also had a palpable sense that inside each dark window was a family or a student or an artist or an old woman living alone, just being int he dark and waiting for the day to come back. Like we were all having one big sleep over, but not so much fun as that.  

This is how a lot of the city is still.  I know people in queens, brooklyn, Staten Island, new jersey, all over, are not normal yet.  And not normal is hard. 

And here at 30 rock, these folks are working so hard this week.  There are kids in the studio every day, because members of the crew and staff had to bring them to work.   Many people are sharing lodging.  Everyone is tired.  But there's this feeling here that we've got to put on a great show.  I'm sure it feels like that here every week.  But wow.  I feel really lucky to be sharing this time with these particular good folks here at SNL.  

In about 5 hours we'll be going on the air.   I'll do a monologue.  And we'll show you some sketches that we wrote and try to make you laugh.   I'm gonna look really dumb in some of this stuff.  But I don't care. Its awfully worth it. And I'm really excited. 

Anyway.  I just wanted to let you know.  If you watch the show tonight, when Don Pardo says my name and you see me walking out, all the shit in this email is what ill be thinking.  I'm a pretty lucky guy.   I hope you enjoy the show.

Thanks. 

Louis C.K. 

Live.  From new york.  Its saturday night.

I studied it in school and used to be pretty good. I've lost a lot of my skill from having not played in ages.

This morning, I was practicing in a tunnel which connects two subway stations right by my apartment. The acoustics are simply amazing -- and let's be honest -- the extra cash tossed in the case by hurried morning commuters is a good incentive to practice.

So, I'm playing one of my favorite songs which is fairly difficult, ""Paranoid Android"" by Radiohead, when I see a figure standing over me. Usually, that means that someone is fishing in the pockets for some change or a single dollar bill. I was concentrated on the fret board so I didn't look up immediately. Generally, I make a point to look at people and smile. However, this particular part of the song was tricky so I had to keep my eyes on my fingers. 

When I could, I looked up to smile at the observer and realized it was in fact an officer of the law.

I stopped playing.

**Me:** *""Good morning, officer. You a big Radiohead fan?*

**Officer:** *""What are you doing?""*

**Me:** *""You're lookin' at it. I'm not sure what else to say, sir.""*

**Officer:** *""I mean, what are you doing here? -- besides trying to make a little money?""*

**Me:** ""*Practicing and giving the nice people some music to listen to during their commute... and making a little money, honestly.*""

**Officer:** ""*I mean, are you homeless?*""

**Me:** ""*No, sir. I have a nice apartment right upstairs. I have lived there for about six years.*""

**Officer:** ""*You're not homeless?*"" 

**Me:** ""*No, sir.*""

**Officer:** ""*And you live right upstairs, you say?... and you just come down here to practice and make a little extra money?*""

**Me:** ""*Yes, sir.*""

**Officer:** ""*Can I see some ID, bud?*""

**Me:** ""*Absolutely.*""

(I hand him my ID)

**Officer:** ""*Have you ever been arrested before?*""

**Me:** ""*No, sir. Totally clean.*""

**Officer:** ""*Totally clean?*""

**Me:** ""*Yes, sir. I'm a good guy.*""

**Officer:** ""*Well, Mr. SoManyMinutes... you seem like a good guy.*""

**Me:** ""*Thank you, officer. I appreciate that.*""

**Officer:** ""*You know that you're not supposed to be here, right?*""

**Me:** ""*Yes, I know.*""

**Officer:** ""*Okay, well. I'm not gonna bust your balls about it. You've got money in your case so I guess people enjoy what you're doing. Just don't start any trouble, okay? -- 'cause if you do then I'll get in trouble and you don't want that. Cool?*""

**Me:** ""*Totally cool. Thank you, officer. Have a good day.*"" 

**Officer:** ""*You, too. I like your version of that song by the way. Take care, Mr. SoManyMinutes.*""

It was rush hour, about 630-7, and the L train is packed three deep, I'm in the middle holding onto the ceiling pole between a 20-something girl and a 30-something guy. The guy was wearing a coat with his backpack on. As the train starts to go, with every bump his backpack keeps hitting me. I turn around once or twice, before he acknowledges me sayingg ""Problem?"" I said ""Yeah, your bag keeps bumping into me, may be a good idea to take it off"" He says ""You have plenty of room, step forward"" (Indicating to the 4 inches between me and the girl). I said ""I'm sure that would make her feel very comfortable"" and turn back around, figuring he's set in his way. Then he says ""First time riding a train?"" Thats when I almost lost it. I said ""I could say the same thing to you, wearing your backpack on a rush hour train"". He said nothing. Then the train pulled into Bedford and a bunch of people  got off so it wasn't as crowded. Was I a dick? Granted, I had a backpack too, but I always take it off and hold it by my legs to take up less room. And I'm not totally opposed to accidental bumps or whatever because, c'mon, its NYC.

Studios Bottom out at $1500-$1600. LES, Murray Hill, Gramercy, FiDi, UWS, UES are the cheapest places (in no particular order). If you get a place for under $1,600 and there is a chalk outline on the floor, it's probably still a good deal. 

The 1 Bedroom bottom is about 2k. 

A 2 bedroom bottoms at like $2200ish. They will all be either convertible (put the wall up yourself), or already converted 1 Bedrooms. 

The cheapest 3 Bedroom's I've seen have been $3,200 and went in like a day. Again, pretty much all convertibles at this price range. 


If you want to figure out where you want to live, [this](http://nymag.com/realestate/neighborhoods/2010/65355/) is an amazing tool that I recommend a lot. It's outdated by a year, but still pretty accurate. 

Should probably add that I didn't include Harlem in the mix, you could live there well below these prices. 

I hope this gives everyone a better idea of what is actually going on in terms of rents. Also, I hate to advertise myself directly and destroy the integrity of the thread - but if anyone thinks they need help finding a place I'd be happy to help a fellow redditor out, just shoot me a PM. I'd be happy to answer any other questions as well.
