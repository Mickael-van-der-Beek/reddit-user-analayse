It's turning into pictures of high school kids standing around on the field doing nothing cool; pictures of dyed heads; mesh jobs; etc. Some of these things are neat but for the most part they're of no consequence and just make me want to unsubscribe from this subreddit. I was just asked by /u/seductivestain:

&gt;Alright Mr. Cynical, what DO you want to see in this subreddit? I'm pretty sure anything lacrosse related is welcome here.

SO, here's some examples of shit to post in /r/lacrosse that's of interest to the entire community:

* [Lyle Thompson, the first native American player to be a finalist for the 2013 Tewaaraton](http://www.ualbanysports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=70191&amp;SPID=7980&amp;DB_LANG=C&amp;ATCLID=207598760&amp;DB_OEM_ID=15800). 
* [The 2013 NLL championship takes place this weekend between the Washington Stealth and the Rochester Knights.](http://www.stealthlax.com/news_article/show/252928?referrer_id=413927-stealth-news). 
* [Interesting arguments about the need (or lack thereof) of a visible shot clock in NCAA play](http://laxallstars.com/the-one-sided-visible-shot-clock-debate/)
* [The MCLA tournament begins this weekend](http://mcla.us/national_tournament/2013/1/)

There are so many other incredible lacrosse things going on right now. The MCLA and NCAA tournaments are about to get underway, and there's 3 posts about doing an NCAA bracket between the frontpage and page 4. Meanwhile, every other post is ""OMG LOOK AT MY STRINGJOB!"" or ""hurr durr i'm standin' 'round with my pole"".  

So there. Start posting cool shit that pertains to all of us. Stop trying to get that link karma by posting pictures of yourself or your gear that nobody cares about.

I'm proposing a lacrosse IQ thread, where we discuss strategy, tactics, tips, hints, slide packages, offensive sets, strength/agility/endurance workouts, individual/group/team drills, clears, rides...ANYTHING that will improve /r/lacrosse's knowledge/ability to play the game instead of the usual useless, self-indulgent, dormant, stereotype-perpetuating posts. 

Coaches and high-level players are preferred, but anybody/any idea is welcome, whether simple or complex. Let's learn how to play and understand lacrosse better. 

Sorry if I come off as a dick, but let us improve. ",,False,self,t5_2r1ig,1340941832.0,,,True,t3_vs0vm,http://www.reddit.com/r/lacrosse/comments/vs0vm/lacrosse_iq_thread/,

When I was asked to be a moderator of this subreddit about two years ago, there weren't that many subscribers (I'm thinking around 200). Now, we're at around 4,000. Fastest growing sport in North America, indeed.

Spring is lacrosse season, and I know both Prawns and I have been busy. I'm a high school girls' lacrosse coach and a teacher, so I don't get that much time on reddit. Prawns has been a kick ass mod for this sub. He's often gotten to the mod mail quicker.

###If you want to contribute as moderator, use ""message the moderators"" to let us know. 

(A post in this thread would also work, I guess.)

###In your message, be sure to let us know the following:

* If you have any experience moderating a subreddit
* Why you want to be a mod for /r/lacrosse
* How active you can be

###Also consider adding the following optional information to your message:

* How you could contribute, i.e. time you could spend actively moderating on a daily basis, would you be a contributor as well, etc.
* If you have any specialized knowledge on how to tweak this subreddit's style, i.e. CSS stuff.
* What you'd like to see in this subreddit, both in style and content.


We'll also consider post history and community activity. Prawns and I will look through the info and make a selection in a few days.

###Be sure to give this post some upvotes so that the community can see it.

**Pro Tips**

Go to the store. Try stuff on. Most of this is preference, these are just the best suggestions. 

Go for feel, not for looks. You don't want to be stuck with an uncomfortable glove just because it looks cool.

Multicolored heads crack easier than their all white counterparts. Stay away from them if you can.",,False,self,t5_2r1ig,1364741144.0,,,True,t3_13jg0w,http://www.reddit.com/r/lacrosse/comments/13jg0w/sticky_gear_advice/,

&gt;Stance/Set-up:

The correct stance is one of the most important aspects of the face-off. There are many ways you can set up for a face-off, everyone has there own style. But it is important to remember these three tips:

1. Don't put any weight on your hands when setting up, you should be able to lift your hands off the ground when doing a face-off and still keep your balance. Also not putting a lot of weight on your hands allows you to move a lot quicker.

2. Set your hands on your stick the same way for every face off; this way you are practicing proper technique, and it is harder for the other man to read what move you are going to do. Place your right hand on the top of your stick as close to the throat as you can, and the left hand in the middle.

3. Line up as close to the ball as you can

&gt;Reading a Player:

No matter if this player is the best or the worst face-off player in the world he is readable. Some are better at hiding what they are going to do, but it can still be done. The most common changes are in the pressure that he has in his hands, the position of the players hands on their stick, and their wrist position. The left wrist position tells a lot about what move he will do. For instance:

1.If the players left wrist is off the ground he will most likely jump the ball or punch it.
2.If the players left wrist is resting on the ground he will usually clamp.


&gt;Countering:

Being able to counter your opponent’s move is also important for being a good face-off middie. The clamp is one of the most popular moves for the face-off but is also the easiest to counter-act. To counter act the Clamp* you use the jump*. To counter act a move such as the jump you would do something I call the punch*. When setting up for the punch put a little bit of pressure on your right hand, and as soon as the whistle blows make a punching motion with your right hand. This will cause the ball to go forward so be ready to scoop it up, or set a pick so a wingman can get it. 
*Refer to the moves section of the post for an explanation of these moves

&gt;Stick Type/What you look for in a face off head:

Offset or not:
Although many of the sticks made now days are offset, a lot of face-off men still like to use on-set or straight heads because it allows them to get there throat of the stick closer to the ball. Offset does have its advantages because for moves such as the jump you don't have to move the head of your stick as much because of how it’s set up. When it comes down to it, it’s all about personal preference.

Flexibility:
Most players who do face-offs prefer stiff heads. They have stiff heads because they don't want their heads to bend due to the other player pushing on them with their stick and all the other contact involved in a face-off.

Flexible sticks can help in getting the ball out of your opponents stick because it can pinch it self temporarily around the ball. More flexible heads can also be used for moves such as the plunger. The only thing to worry about flexible heads it that they sometimes don't flex back all the right after the face-off do to the pressure you put on it. So if you use more force in your moves go with a stiff head.

&gt;Basic Moves

Clamp:
This is probably the most common and simplest move in the game today. It goes like this. Basically, you snap your left hand forward, so as to make the back of your head come down on top of the ball. You can then rake the ball out to your wing or pop it behind you to pick it up yourself.

Jump:
The jump is sometimes called a reverse clamp due to the fact that you still trap the ball with your head, but you trap it with the face of your head, instead of the back. Here’s how it goes. This move requires a lot of things to go on at once, so it is a slight bit complicated. You use your right hand to pick your head up off the ground, while tilting the top back towards yourself and pushing it forward at he same time. You then bring it back down once you get over the ball, so as to trap the ball. Once again, you can either rake it or pop back to yourself. If you did the move correctly, your stick should be underneath your opponent’s, as this move is used to beat the clamp.

Punch:
Also called a push, this is another fairly simple move; it just takes a little muscle. Here’s how it goes. Using your right hand, you tilt the top sidewall of your head back toward yourself, while pushing the head forward at the same time. This will hopefully push the ball forward, so it ends up behind your opponent. It works best against a jump, but can also work well against a clamp.

Plunger:
This is a really fun move if you can actually pull it off in a game. It goes like this. When the whistle blows, you clamp down half-way. You then lift up on the back of your shaft and put some weight on your head. This will pinch the ball in between your sidewalls. You can then pull it out and flip it to yourself or a teammate. Be careful with this one, though, as some refs may call you for it seeing as it is technically stuck in the back of your head, but the rule is kinda shady on all this, and if you get it down fast enough, most refs won’t have enough time to see that it is stuck in your head.

Two Finger:
Ah, the infamous two-finger… so cheap, yet so effective. Be very careful with this one, as it WILL be called EVERY time if the ref ends up seeing it, and there have been cases of people breaking their fingers from this move. Here’s how it goes. If you know your opponent is gonna clamp, you take you index and middle fingers on your right hand and flip them out, so as to catch his mesh as he clamps down. You then lift up his stick and either rake it or kick it out. This move should only be used but two or three times a game since your opponent will pick up on it pretty quick if you keep using it. And, you must remember to hide your hands from the ref with your body so he can’t actually see what you are doing.

Tips:
-Your three main moves are like a game of “rock, paper, scissors”. A clamp, beats a push, which beats a jump, which beats a clamp. So, reading his hands and anticipating his move is an important tool in facing off.
-When clamping, if you both clamp at the some time, and neither has fully clamped the ball, it helps to push your left hand forward. This will help you get your stick under his. If he does beat you in the clamp, try to get your right foot in the path of where he will rake the ball. This will buy you some more time and possibly give you a second chance at the ball if he is dumb enough to flick it into your foot.
-It’s always fun to mess with your opponent before you go down to face… tell him how much your jock itches, that you had *** fantasies last night, etc. It gets him off his game and you can get a good laugh out of it too.
-After the ref calls set, I always like to clear my throat, whisper “go”, or make some kind of noise, to see if the guy I’m going against has ADD and will jump early at any noise… once again, kinda cheap, but it works sometimes.

-High School Junior starter on Varsity, big deal, I come from a top high school in CT. The team is mostly Juniors and Seniors, with 2 Junior starters. A freshman who made v squad 4 years ago was the first in 20 years, and he is on his way to Colgate. We've had MLL, Big 5 (Cuse, Duke, UNC, UVA, and Hopkins) players most years.  
-Open offers from numerous schools (BU, Providence, Brown, Beloit, Dartmouth, Yale, and Endicott) but I'm waiting to find my status with my #1, Tufts, before I commit.
-8 Goals from Close D as a Soph.
-Was a Captain/Coach my Soph year, where I volunteered to play JV to stick close to my grade, who has few leaders. Offered a scholarship purely on that (to a pvt. HS but still)
-Play on one of the top club teams in the US in the summer, Yale's Bulldog Elite.

This sport is tight.
Play everyday
morning till night.

My favorite part
is a broken heart
from a hopeless shooter
who needs a tutor.

Shooters beware.
You cannot spare
the price of this toll,
for I keep the goal.

Like a sleeper's hold
your body will fold
when I intervene
like a chill in your spleen.

A god I do seem,
demi, in fact,
supplying the team
with a bone to its back.

Play like a boss,
but ghost to the win.
Blamed for a loss
cause we're human in the end.

Look at his sweatshirt in the second photo.

I looked around for him on google and couldn't find anything saying that he played lacrosse. I checked UNH's [roster](http://mcla.us/teams/new_hampshire/2011/roster.html) and he wasn't there. Anyone have any additional info on this? Maybe he was on the team at one point or he got cut?

Edit: http://www.tnhonline.com/mobile/america-s-freshman-1.2789055

Above is a thread that I started asking for some help for my first time playing. Well yesterday was my first game and I believe I played very well for my first time. 

I play defense and got about 4-5 ground balls, and turned one into a goal! I wasn't to aggressive though on some of the checks but it is something I have to work on. 

Thanks one more time /r/lacrosse",,False,self,t5_2r1ig,False,,,True,t3_v9tbr,http://www.reddit.com/r/lacrosse/comments/v9tbr/played_in_my_first_game_ever_yesterday_did_great/,

This is a pretty long story, so before i start i want to say this is nothing like what i have ever seen on this subreddit or ever.  It may not be a big deal over reddit, but in person this was life changing... in a bad way.  Okay, so i play on a lacrosse team for my high school and our practice ended early and we went over to watch the Freshman team's game.  It was a normal game, until one kid on my town's team (a first year) got completely wrecked (lets call him #15) by number 45 on the other team.  They both went down on the turf when #45 gets on his knees and starts crawling up #15.  I shit you not he humped #15 twice and then got up.  The ref blew his whistle at least 10 times, but then only gave him a 30 second penalty for Unsportsmanlike Conduct.  He gets up runs to his bench and calls #15 a fagget!! Our coach (JV) literally screams ""SHUT UP KID!""  
I'll try to update you guys of what happened with #45 and what our coach or the freshman coach says at practice about it.  Just thought i would share this story with some other players.

My college club team has some very serious practice attendance issues. We're a small team, the school doesn't necessarily like us all that much, and adding on people not showing up isn't helping our case. We have about 8-10 guys who consistently show up, even though we can and have had practices with upwards of 16, 17 guys. Nobody cares, and always has an excuse not to come. I want to play. I hit the wall. I show up every day. I love this game too much to let others ruin it. But I can't progress if nobody shows, especially as a pole. 

I've thought about playing at other schools, but I wouldn't ever make lacrosse my only reason for a transfer, especially since I'm already a sophomore. So other than a rant about my team, my questions are:

-Does anyone else have to deal with this sort of thing on a regular basis?

-If so, how do you deal with it, considering cutting playing time for not showing up means not having enough to play?

-Is there anything I can do to help my president/player coach to get people to come other than flyers and talking to the players to get them to come (which has been done numerous times)?

Sorry this has been so long, but I've been dealing with this for two seasons now, I'm sick of it, and don't know what to do.

It consisted of four guaranteed games, with a possible fifth for the champs. In our fourth game, we faced a team consisting of mainly huge beefy dudes. (I'm a guy by the way) I play x attack, and was faced with the largest guy on the team about twice my size, who also had a ponytail. By far this was the dirtiest team I had ever played, and there was no shortage of bad sportsmanship from them when we whooped them 16-2, but of course the worst offender on the entire team was the huge monster I was up against. I was subjected to countless back checks, cross checks, helmet checks, and even a deliberate crotch check. While the ref noticed all these things, he did nothing about it but take the guy to the side about five times and tell him to (actual quote) ""soften the hits a little"". I couldn't understand it! Why would this happen? At this point i was more than pissed, and when he scooped the next ground ball, I drove into him with all I had and knocked him right off his feet. I heard a penalty whistle and was outraged! What the hell! That was a completely legal check on the same player who's been playing dirty all game with no apprehension! When I was pulled off for a two and a half minute non-releasable penalty, he pulled of his helmet, and lo and behold, it was a girl! While suprised, I still could think of no reason why she should get special treatment. As the biggest player on the field, not to mention the strongest, I didn't think she needed any extra protection. So reddit, what do you think? Was it fair for her to be treated differently based on gender?",,False,self,t5_2r1ig,False,,,True,t3_uqcpv,http://www.reddit.com/r/lacrosse/comments/uqcpv/girls_deserve_special_treatment/,

Why can't we talk about how actual games? Why can't we talk about how SU throttled Johns Hopkins in from of a crowd of 6300 people? Why not talk about rankings or how John Hopkins managed to get every single one of there regular season games on ESPN? (monumental move BTW)

I would love to see this thread move beyond just flashy equipment. You can have the coolest looking stuff on the field. You will still be benched if you can't play or understand the game

Shanghai is a very international city with many foreigners studying abroad and expat's working overseas. I was able to be apart of the Shanghai lacrosse organization and watch/help them grow a expat team that hosted a international tournament as well as raise a Chinese national team.

I guess this can be a ask me anything. For me as an chinese american, it was really exciting to watch a couple of expats take a 5 on 5 monday night toss/game and turn it into a 70+ person league.

so.. Ask me anything about it I guess. I'm gonna head to the gym and have a couple of errands I have to run and take care of since coming back to America. Will answer questions later!

The refs advised him that he was then obligated to forfeit the game, and he refused. The two teams then finished the game.

I'm aghast.  This seems completely contrary to what I want my kid to learn playing sports.  Calls by referees sometimes don't go your way, it's part of sports.  I hate the message that this guy sent to our and his own players by refusing to obey the officials on the field.

I've complained both to his community's lacrosse association, and to the overall lacrosse association for our area.  I view this as a serious issue of respect, and a safety issue for all players.  Why should kids play cleanly if their coaches will simply ignore calls that they don't like?

I'm from Southwest Washington and we didn't have lacrosse there. We had it at some of the larger private school in Portland at the time, but it hadn't made it's way up to SW Washington. It was played up in Seattle, but couldn't quite get down I-5 to us either. 

One day, my friend came to me and a few other guys and said, ""Hey, do you want to learn how to play lacrosse with me? There's a clinic going on over at this indoor gym.""

I didn't know it, but that moment would change my life and the city I live in a few short years. The simple question of asking someone if they want to learn to play lacrosse brought 20 7th/8th graders to a clinic to begin building a program in SW Wa. Over the years we had new additions and lost some guys to other sports. By the time I was a senior in high school, we had a total of 4 guys who had been there from the very first game we all played in 8th grade until then. Two of us had been at that very first clinic together. 

During my time there we went from JV2 to JV (in Oregon), to D2 Varsity in Washington, to title contender in D2 Varsity my senior year. After I left, they were pushed up to D1 Varsity. They have continued the 7th/8th team, continued the JV and JV2 team for high school, and they have added a 5th/6th team. The club is getting kids started at a very young age now. The program has grown from 20 kids with rented equipment to a few hundred with a brand new field. 

This year a new team was added to a local high school. They are currently D2 Varsity. They played their very first game and won handily. The sport is growing and I don't doubt that there will be more teams added in the next 5 years to this area. 

And it all started with one question:

1374537133.0,18,self.lacrosse,1iukpe,Lacrosse shaft manufacturing Kickstarter campaign,nozicky,21,3,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/lacrosse/comments/1iukpe/lacrosse_shaft_manufacturing_kickstarter_campaign/,"A while ago, I became curious about what the actual differences were between various lacrosse shafts and how much it actually cost to manufacture them. (This thread from the Inside Lacrosse Forums)[http://forums.insidelacrosse.com/showthread.php?108552-Shaft-Materials-Info-Revised-4-9-12] was a big help to get me started. The engineer in me then went and started looking through product specs from aluminum manufacturers to compare 7050, 7075, 7055, 7068, etc. alloys.

After doing some thinking and a bit more online research into the prices of aluminum pipes, I began to wonder why there are no discount lacrosse shaft manufacturers and thought about starting one myself.

Obviously that would be a large undertaking. However, the most difficult part would be marketing and sales. In order to keep the per shaft price low enough, I would probably have to order a few thousand of them. Selling that many without a marketing budget is no easy task.

I was thinking that the best way to do it would be through Kickstarter. That way the initial fundraising, sales and marketing is done up front and I wouldn't have to find an investor willing to put up the tens of thousands of dollars this will take.

My back of the envelope calculations lead me to believe that I could probably be able to sell shafts made from a high quality 7050, 7055 or 7075 series aluminum alloy for about $20 for an A/M length and $30 for a long pole. Scandium enhanced alloys would probably be out of the question at these price ranges because scandium is incredibly expensive (it trades at around $15,000 per kilogram on the metal markets. That would mean a raw material price of $21 for 1% of a 5 ounce shaft to be made of scandium. Compare that to aluminum which is about 80 cents per pound. None of the other metals trade for more than a few dollars a pound, so the materials cost wouldn't matter much.).

That's a very, very preliminary estimate as it's entirely based on some Internet research and some guesswork and doesn't include shipping costs. I wouldn't want to go much higher than those prices because then it's no longer a discounted shaft.

Before I start doing things like calling aluminum manufacturers to ask about pricing and minimum order size to formulate a much more concrete proposal from which to launch a Kickstarter campaign, I want to try to gauge interest and see if there would be demand for such a thing. US Lacrosse estimates there are about 400,000 youth lacrosse players and 280,000 high school players. Selling even 1000 shafts with a potential market that size is no small feat and to be able to offer them at the $20/$30 price point, it may have to be even more than that.

The plan would be to try to have them in everyone's hands by March of 2014 so that everyone has them in time for the spring season. So my question is basically, would you be willing to back a Kickstarter campaign similar to what I just described?",,False,self,t5_2r1ig,False,,,True,t3_1iukpe,http://www.reddit.com/r/lacrosse/comments/1iukpe/lacrosse_shaft_manufacturing_kickstarter_campaign/,

It's time the tournament caught up with the rest of the sport and changed a bit.

For one it's stupid that all teams aren't seeded. I understand that not seeding all teams allows you some leeway on travel, but come on. Denver is going to have to travel far regardless of who they play, and it's either teams from the east coast or midwest. Travel is hardly an issue.

Beyond that, the tournament totally missed on seeding this year. Notre Dame a 2 and Ohio State a 3? Ohio State finishes the season strong, that's fair if you want to reward them for that. But Notre Dame did the opposite and got a 2 seed for it. North Carolina finishes the season number 1 in both polls, finishes the season strong, and gets a 5? It makes no sense.

Then, if Maryland had won yesterday, Ohio State as the 3 seed would have played the sixth seeded Maryland IN College Park. There are Semis in Indy this year. Send Denver to Maryland. I doubt the difference between Indy and Maryland, when flying from Denver, is that significant. Send Ohio State to Indy.

Plus they have teams playing on different days, which is just unnecessarily inconsistent. Syracuse should have played on Saturday. Ohio State should have played yesterday but be going to Indy. Even if they decide they NEED to have Denver potentially go to Indy, they should have played yesterday and not on Saturday.",,False,self,t5_2r1ig,False,,,True,t3_1e98q6,http://www.reddit.com/r/lacrosse/comments/1e98q6/the_ncaa_tournament_needs_to_be_reworked_a_bit/,

It was a good series of games. We won the JV game and they won the varsity game. 

As demanded by our coach we all showed good sportsmanship even when we were frustrated and made mistakes/committed penalties. 

The Duluth coach however was the most unsportsmanlike, rude, (and many other things I'd rather not have linked to an account of mine online) person I've ever met. 

He:

1.  Yelled at our players on the sideline that were trying to communicate with our players on the field, by telling them to ""shut up"". 
2. Yelled at our managers (volunteers) when they had a minor mistake at the table (Wrong number for a ground ball).
3. Was constantly yelling at the refs who were trying there best (lax hasn't been in GA very long so they had no opportunity to play themselves). 
4. Didn't make his team have a ""RaaRaa"" cheer at the end of the game. (This is standard, at least in GA, don't know about other regions)
5. (This is where it gets ridiculous) Refused to shake any of the players, coaches, or managers hands in line after the game.
6. When our coach started getting upset (understandable at this point) this coach said said ""sportsmanship is a joke"" and proceeded to spout out curse words and racial slurs at our team. (Our school is predominantly black but the team in predominately white, not that we make a distinction) (Plus they had plenty of black people on their team as well. Their best player was black!)

This is just ridiculous to me. I was so duimbfounded when he refused to shake my hand that I didn't have the logic to react. 

I'm more than upset by this behavior as it sheds a negative light on our sport that is shining pillar of great sportsmanship. 

The saddest part about the whole thing to me is that the players were in no way respectful too. They had modeled their behavior after their coach. Is depressing to think that these students are being lead by someone of this character. This team has the opportunity to be a good team in a rising cultural group in the south but when people with these ethics and morals are involved t sickens me. 

I'm sorry if this has no place here I just needed to rant about the most ridiculous and depressing thing I've ever seen in many years enjoying this great sport. Thanks for being and audience.


**TL;DR**: The coach of the team that we played was completely disrespectful, yelling at our players on the sideline,(Unjustly) at the refs, and the volunteers that were running the table. At the end of the game they didn't perform a ""RaaRaa"" cheer and the coach refused to shake our hand in the line after the game. When our coach got onto him out of anger he proceeded to say ""Sportsmanship is a joke"" and called our team many curse words and racial slurs. It just disappoints me that people would act like this in our great sport. 

Needless to say we will ***NEVER*** be playing Duluth again.",,False,self,t5_2r1ig,False,,,True,t3_19dim7,http://www.reddit.com/r/lacrosse/comments/19dim7/im_sorry_but_thats_just_ridiculous/,

So basically what I would like to do is have people comment here telling me what shafts they like and what they have (and your position). I will compose a list of sticks (handles and heads) for each position. From then on people that need to look up what stick they should get as a beginning player can look at one thread.

(X-post for r/womens_lacrosse)",RighteousJelly,21,5,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/lacrosse/comments/1jpuy7/my_mother_is_concerned_and_so_am_i_xpost_for/,"To start off with, I have Marfan Syndrome. If you don't know what it is, then you can read up on it [here](http://www.marfan.org/marfan/2280/About-Marfan-Syndrome) The TL;DR: Affects connective tissue in my whole entire body, including joints and heart.

I'm 14 years old and female. I was diagnosed with it in 6th grade. My cardiologist told me I couldn't do any sports except for jogging and swimming. I hate swimming, so that's automatically out, and track/cross country just isn't for me.

I heard a few of my guy friends talking about lacrosse and how much fun it is and I decided that I wanted to check it out. I watched a few videos on YouTube and it seems like a lot of fun. It's mostly running and throwing, I'm assuming, which is why I think that I would be able to play it even though I have this heart disease. I have a cardiologist appointment soon, which I will be asking him about it, but for now I wanted to get you guys' opinions.

I was a big basketball player in the past, but it really affected my knees. I also played just about every other popular sport (softball, soccer, etc.) and I didn't really have these problems with softball or soccer, just basketball. I'm guessing it was like this because of all the jerking around and quick direction changes that you make in softball. Keep in mind, I played all these sports before I was diagnosed and on medication.

My mom is concerned for a lot of reasons. #1 would be the heart issues, obviously. #2 is the physical contact. I read online that women's lacrosse was not nearly as violent as men's. #3 Would be the lack of protection. This wraps around the physical contact thing, and she's afraid that I'll get hit with a ball/stick. What can I say to her about #2 and #3? #1 is a cardiologist issue, so there's nothing I can do about that.

I'm concerned because of the joint issues. I felt like I had arthritis at 12 years old back when I played basketball. I don't want that to happen again, but I'm willing to do it even if it makes my knees hurt if the cardiologist says I can. My question is, is there lots of jerking around, like there is in basketball?

I really really want to do lacrosse. Ever since I've been diagnosed, which was over 2 years ago, I've become this lazy slob that does nothing but eat, and go on the internet. I'm not fat, because I don't know why, but I'm not. I just want to get out of this habit, and start getting fit and motivated again. I remember how much fun sports were for me, and I really want to be able to do them again.

I can't really make a TL;DR for this because every detail counts, so don't feel like you have to read it all if you don't want to.

Thank you so much to anyone who answers my questions.",,False,self,t5_2r1ig,False,,,True,t3_1jpuy7,http://www.reddit.com/r/lacrosse/comments/1jpuy7/my_mother_is_concerned_and_so_am_i_xpost_for/,

So I started playing lacrosse in the 7th grade, where my old school's team, which was, in all due respect, a joke. I didnt really pick it up until 8th grade, and i played attack then. I knew i was going to switch schools, and that the school i now currently attend was reputed to be among the top 50 in the nation. So i traded my shortie into a pole, and practiced all throughout the summer, and happily enough, come springtime, i made the team.


I was surprised, to come from no lacrosse experience, and through hard work, made the team. (But i still am far from the best)


The team went 13-2 this year, against DC, NoVa, and Baltimore teams. And we won our championship. I didnt play in the championship game, but frankly, i dont really care.



Thanks guys, for an amazing year. Go Bears.

In a continuing effort to clean up (or at least standardise) submissions on this subreddit, we're going to make a push for all Stringing and stick related posts be sent to /r/StickDoctor instead. 

Now, I know there are already existing subreddits for stringing (/r/sdl2, /r/lacrossestringing, /r/stringing) but they never quite took off. Partially due to us as mods of /r/lacrosse not pushing content their way perhaps. Either way, instead of having to pick a favourite, we've created /r/StickDoctor and have invited the moderators from all 3 subs to help run the place.

**So what does this mean for you?**

From now on, we will be removing the ever prevalent ""Look at my stick"", ""How do I string X"" and ""Please critique my setup"" and will be encouraging people to repost their submissions there instead. 

**How can you help?**

Subscribe to /r/Stickdoctor if you like stringing. Post your submissions. Upvote good string jobs and tutorial and help people fix their crappy set ups.

I'm a senior in high school, and I've been playing lacrosse for about seven years now. 

I play attack (specifically X/Crease depending on the set we're using), and I'm wondering.. how can I calm down during a game?

We practice shooting/finishing shots daily on varsity for about a half hour. In practice I usually catch and finish well and make pretty good shots. However, come game time I get nervous as soon as I cut, and in my first two games I've missed multiple shots on the crease (some WIDE open) because I get nervous and I either miss the pass, or don't finish well. 

So I'm asking you fellow laxers, how do you zen out before/during a game?",,False,self,t5_2r1ig,False,,,True,t3_1ah7i4,http://www.reddit.com/r/lacrosse/comments/1ah7i4/tips_for_calming_nerves_before_a_game/,
