All of the other major U.S. cities that truly have excellent or even pretty decent public transit are also places where it gets very cold...NYC, Chicago, Boston, etc. Same thing goes for biking; Minneapolis is well-known for being an incredibly bike-friendly city (and for good reason), but biking isn't much fun when it's -30 degrees out.

So am I right about this, or am I missing something? If you agree that this is the case, why do you think that is? To me, it would make way more sense for there to be robust public transportation, bike lanes, and a walking-friendly culture in a place where it's nice and warm, and being outside is reasonable at most times of the year.

About a year and a half ago, my boyfriend and I lost our fifth damn car (collectively) in the course of around five years. We seem to genuinely just have bad luck...my boyfriends first car was a clunker and literally fell apart within two years. His second car he was rammed into by a drunk driver, totaled. My first car was hit by another driver, insurance paid off the rest of my car. Second car was hit by a teen that was very drunk and high. Insurance also paid off that car. The last car we got was given to us by someone moving out of country (which we were grateful for) and then broke down on the highway in 90 degree weather when our baby was 10 months old. Since then we haven't had a car (about 18 months, give or take). Our setup has been...I carpool to work, boyfriend works at home, twice a week his grandma that lives about a mile and a half down leant us her car to go do major grocery shopping/take kiddo out/run errands/etc. In return we'd pay for part of gas and insurance and do things for her as well (like run errands, clean up her house a bit, mow the lawn,etc.) Recently she said she couldn't do that for us anymore and wants us to get our own car in three months. Fair enough, we appreciated her help for the long time being.


So in the meantime we've been wanting to move to Portland, OR for many reasons. We're just genuinely miserable where we are and don't want our daughter to grow up here. With a car a lot of our savings would be gone, and we'd more than likely have to put off moving for a while. We plan to move in a neighborhood where a car isn't necessary, so we wouldn't need one post-move, either.


After looking into what would be around a +$500 increase in our monthly expenses, my boyfriend comes to me and says, ""What if we aim to move next year, and we don't get a car"". I think it sounds crazy, but I start to look into it. Apparently our towns transit system has increased greatly over the past year. Of course, I wouldn't know, for whatever reason most people treat public transport like a disease around here. But there's a bus stop about a half-block town from our apartment, and most routes run every 25-30 minutes and go most places we'd want to go. There's two grocery stores within a mile or less of us, including the gas station across the street which sells milk, bread, eggs, etc. We already order a few bulk items from Amazon, and after looking around, with planning we could order a lot more of our food stuffs from them. A friend of mine is already going to lend me her bike that is mostly unused so I can get around faster. 



ANYWAYS. I should also mention we live in a town where not owning a car is like having voluntary contact-contagious leperasy (sp?). I'm  serious. I mention to a couple friends that we're greatly considering going completely carless, and they say flat out ""You can't do that with a kid"". When I try to explain the above circumstances that would make it possible, at least until we move, they laugh, roll their eyes, tell me I'm nuts.



Am I crazy? Honestly? The gas prices aren't getting any lower, and what's wrong with a working bus route, and walking/taking a bike and getting in some exercise?...Am I really just some delusional hippie?",,False,,t5_2s5gk,False,,,True,t3_114yjj,http://www.reddit.com/r/lowcar/comments/114yjj/am_i_crazy_for_being_without_a_car_with_a_child/,

Insurance sucks. Repair bills suck. Cops are jerks. Traffic sucks. It's not good for the environment. Etc. etc. 

Honestly, I have no need for a car other then to get to school or work, but that's the probably. Public transit in my part of New Jersey is a joke. Unless you're commuting into the city, you're kind of fucked. My current job is in Basking Ridge, my new job is in Springfield, my school is in New Brunswick.

If you're feeling crazy, go online and try to find a way to get from Bound Brook to those places. You will find literally next to nothing. 

My goal is to eventually move to a more transit-friendly city after I graduate - New York and the surrounding area, Philadelphia, Boston, Washington D.C., San Francisco and Tuscon. 

(Actually, I just found out my new job is very, very accessible via bus....so....woohoo? Maybe I can make the leap to a no-car lifestyle after all. )

Hate it.  With a passion. Unfortunately, my life is such that I drive 50+ miles daily as a suburban mom.  However, I somehow stumbled on this reddit, and am asking myself, could some of these miles be replaced by a bike?

Most of my drives are out and back -- to daughter's school (5 mi), grocery store (depending on which one: 2.5mi - 4mi), park (3 mi).  The park is the location for gymnastics and ballet for my daughters. 

My home city has adopted a bike-friendly attitude.  My neighborhood has posted ""share the road"" signs and 2 foot bike-able shoulders and/or bike lanes that could get me to the park and to grocery stores as well as the library and downtown area (4-5 miles). There are some serious hills, so I would need a granny gear (and realistically, electric assist if towing kids -- I live at the top of a hill).

However, this is my problem.  I'd love to think I could replace the school drive with a bike ride, but as a practical matter, I'm torn.  The general attitude of the populace around here is ""cars belong on the road, bikes belong on the sidewalk"".  With the exception of the weekend warrior types (think thirty plus men in spandex on Sunday morning) 95+% bikers use on the sidewalks (there are no pedestrians -- distances are too great).  The school is located on an arterial road with wide sidewalks on both sides --I have never seen anyone (pedestrian or bike) on these sidewalks. I could bike on the sidewalks (not strictly legal/kosher) and have a 5-6 mile ride (1/2-1 mile on sidewalk), or use back roads (through low-density neighborhoods) and have a 7 mile ride, crossing the arterial road twice at lights and walking the bike on the sidewalk for the last &lt;.25 mi) -- this would the ""most legal"" method.  Fastest? Obviously not. Safest?  Not sure.

 Should I consider the sidewalks around here multi-use? WWr/lcD?",,False,,t5_2s5gk,False,,,True,t3_16jv6h,http://www.reddit.com/r/lowcar/comments/16jv6h/could_i_go_lower_car/,

I broke a cheekbone, lost a tooth and broke 3 others, broke my arm, and scraped my face on the asphalt on my fall. I also suffered a concussion. 
[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/00e8B.jpg)  

I read [/r/bicycling](/r/bicycling) daily, and took to heart all the safety suggestions, but in the end a stupid fuck tried to pass me with too little space last Tuesday. I was wearing a reflective vest and I had 2 bright 7-LED lights on my bike. I was happy to bike home every day, and it gave me a great way to sandwich my day. I am sad to say I'll be purchasing a car soon when this is all settled. 

I don't mean to scare anyone, because if I had to do it all over again I'd probably still ride. But I just want to urge everyone to be extremely careful when riding at night. People get impatient and will not make your safety the utmost priority. I have to say that my gut feeling was that it was unsafe to bike at night and near my college, SDSU. Instead, I sucked it up and biked anyway. I'm not altogether sure that was a good decision. 

I don't know if anything good will come of this, but I really feel pissed. This is a college town--there should be safe alternative transportation for students. I don't know what I can do, but I'm really upset and feeling ragey. If you read, thank you.

A few years ago I sold my Ford Focus, a little car that in two years time I only put 2000 miles on it. It was obvious that I needed to sell that car. Since then I've been getting buy using a car share, but by mostly riding around on my bike, and it's been fantastic.

However, I got laid off and against my better judgement I took a job for shitty pay up in the hills at a ski resort. I thought I might need a car, but found it difficult to buy one since the money I had saved up I intended on using to pay my student loans.

Fast forward a month later. I am working at the ski resort, car free. I've hitch hiked, bummed rides and hitched rides off of co-workers to get food. Great, it works out.

Now here is the problem. I really need to get out of town for a day to give a presentation and take an exam. I thought it would just be easy enough to ride back into town with a co-worker, rent a car, and be back the next day.... no such luck. Every rental places closes before I can get there. If I was planning on sticking it out this whole ski season not having a car wouldn't be an issue. Considering the low pay and some of the harassment I've been receiving from other employees, I've decided that I need to jettison as soon as possible. 

Thus my need to own a car is born. And I fucking hate it.",,False,,t5_2s5gk,False,,,True,t3_131faw,http://www.reddit.com/r/lowcar/comments/131faw/my_continuing_car_free_battle/,

Here's one thing I've learned: to many people, including the teams in charge of gathering data and/or setting standards at Walkscore and setting walking routes in Google maps, ""walkability"" does not include the presence of sidewalks or pedestrian paths. This weekend, I looked at 2 houses that had a Walkscore of over 70-- and was in an area that many people told me was great in terms of walkability-- but had no sidewalks anywhere, except part of the way down the large, main, 4-lane road. Conversely, I looked at a place that had a very low Walkscore, but had wide sidewalks everywhere, as well as a bike lane.

So, back to my question. To me, walkability always includes one important thing: a place for pedestrians to go where cars may not, for the entirety of a given route. What's your view on this topic? Is an area ""walkable"" solely by virtue of being near/sort of near various destinations, even if you have to walk in the street to get there?

Turns out I'm almost completely average when it comes to housing. I'm right in the middle class category, and I spend about 27.7% on housing -- just 1% more than average. Yet, my transportation costs (transit + occasional car sharing) are about 1.7%, which is WAY lower than any of the income categories. Even if you add in the amortized value of all of my family's bikes -- even though they're more for recreation than transportation -- with a pessimistic view of a 5 year lifetime per bike, it works out to 3.5% at the VERY most.

This is interesting to me because the typical argument says that sure, you can save money by living without a car, but you have to pay a lot more for housing in an expensive, dense area. Yet, here I am, with a family of 4, in a somewhat dense but mostly single-family-house neighborhood, with relatively good biking and transit access, and my housing costs are totally average. And it's not because we're super frugal with housing -- we could live in a significantly smaller/cheaper place, and indeed, we did a couple years ago.

How about you? Is this whole ""I need a car for cheap housing"" notion overplayed?",,False,,t5_2s5gk,False,,,True,t3_xip59,http://www.reddit.com/r/lowcar/comments/xip59/how_america_spends_its_money_im_curious_what_your/,

I live in a city where everything is pretty close together and which has a great public transportation system. 

But there are still times that I wish I had a car to leave the city or make a particularly large grocery trip. So, I'm thinking about getting a cheap one.  

My only problem with this prospect is insurance. Since gas is only an as-needed thing, I don't have a problem with that; I also consider the initial cost of the car as a kind of investment (and I have enough saved). But I don't want to pay an arm and a leg every month for insurance when I might use it once or twice a month. Do those of you who have cars and rarely use them find this cost worth it? I'm a 19 year old with one speeding ticket on my record, so it wouldn't be cheap. Do most insurance companies make any reductions based on how often it's used, and if so, how can you prove that? 

I really just don't know a lot about it -- the last time I 'had' a car it was one that my parents owned, and I just payed *them* for the insurance (about $130/month). I've never had to go through an insurance company before and am afraid I'll overpay due to my ignorance.

I've been looking into cargobike type things as a replacement (besides groceries or whatever, I need a good way to take the cat to the vet and those pull-along trailers make me nervous, as do those cheap little metal back-racks, mostly because I don't trust myself to attach something that will hold him).

1296526527.0,15,self.lowcar,fcsjd,What are the best cities in the USA for living a car-free lifestyle? I want to move while I am still young and have less to leave behind.,,16,1,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/lowcar/comments/fcsjd/what_are_the_best_cities_in_the_usa_for_living_a/,"Hello /r/lowcar,

I just recently graduated college, and going from a very walk/bike-able college campus back to my state's normal car-dominated landscape has made me interested in saving up some money and preparing myself to pick up and find a more pedestrian/cyclist-friendly culture. Currently I live in the axis of suburban sprawl in Connecticut that stretches between Hartford and New Haven.

In college I used my bicycle as my primary mode of transportation, but I have found that biking on most roads in my area is close to suicidal. To get from my apartment to work or any basic necessity would require traversing near-shoulderless roads where traffic moves along at anywhere between 40-60 (10-15 above the speed limit is considered the norm on most roads) miles per hour. Walking is also normally out of the question because of a very low density. The only apartments in my area that are located within walking distance of useful amenities are in relatively bad neighborhoods (higher crime rates, roach patrol apartments, etc). Despite it being normal around here, I can't stand the idea of everything I do hinging on my car.

So I ask you, /r/lowcar, where in this country can I go to completely break my dependence on a car? I have read both of J. H. Crawford's books (Carfree Cities and Carfree Design Manual) and love the concept of the reference city he uses, but I gather that there is nothing like that in the US. Assuming that there isn't, I would definitely love to find something that comes close to it. While I am on the subject of a wishlist, something a bit warmer and sunnier than Connecticut wouldn't hurt either.

**tl;dr:** I want to move somewhere in the USA where I can more easily live car-free.",,False,,t5_2s5gk,False,,,True,t3_fcsjd,http://www.reddit.com/r/lowcar/comments/fcsjd/what_are_the_best_cities_in_the_usa_for_living_a/,

Some of you have seen my not-too-subtle posts around reddit lately advertising the virtues of trains (and transit in general) over cars.  To help punch up my point, I've started working on an **[info graphic](http://i.imgur.com/pATtq.jpg)** and I'd like your feedback on it.

It's still pretty rough, but any an all feedback is welcome.  Whether it's on the data or the graphics.  I've got sources for all my numbers, so if anyone is interested in that I can provide it (and plan to have them all at the bottom of the graphic in the final version).  

I don't really know what the ultimate goal for this project is, other than to raise awareness of the issue.  I imagine I'd probably post it to one of the larger reddits eventually, and perhaps submit it to a few blogs.  Thoughts on how that should go are also welcomed.

Thanks!

I realize it sounds that way. I'm just trying to give a detailed picture.

I currently live in a duplex with no garage, shed, or other secure place to park bikes outside at ground level. Therefore, I must keep my bikes inside the house, and drag them in and out the front door every time I ride. I've managed to devote a corner of my living room to bike storage, but it only fits two, so if we want to go on a family ride, at least one bike needs to be dragged up from the basement, through narrow stairs with a 180 degree turn.   Our bikes are also somewhat heavy, as we are pretty practical with them (e.g. steel, cargo rack, kid seat), so that makes them even more of a pain to carry around. The walls and doorways take a bit of a beating. Our front door is awkwardly oriented, plus there's a screen door outside of it (and a few stairs), and I also try to keep the tires and my shoes off of the floor because we have a baby crawling around and licking everything. Oh yeah and don't forget to pump up the tires! This all adds up to an incredibly tedious process of getting the bike in and out of the house. I do it every workday because I've decided that it's not really optional (for health), but if I was less insistent about that, I'd just ride the bus instead. It's a lot simpler. Indeed, up until a couple months ago, I hardly ever rode my bike.

This is kind of depressing when I think back to my more suburban youth, where I'd just open the garage, wheel my bike out the huge, open doorway, and hit the button on the way out. I rode ALL the time. I desperately want to get back to this idyllic setup. Lack of a garage has turned biking from a purely fun thing into a fun thing wrapped in a shell of frustration. We are currently planning to buy a house in the next 6 months and a garage (or at least a decent shed) is one of my top criteria. It's huge. We could all roll out, all four of us, with two bikes and a trail-a-bike, with so much less hassle.

I also wonder about all the other people out there, living in the city, who have a family larger than 1 or 2 people, who would probably bike more if they had a garage they could painlessly roll their fleet in and out of. But I've never heard anyone make the connection between garages and bike ridership. Am I overblowing the hassle of lugging bikes in and out of the home? Or is this really an issue that could be having a big (but silent) impact?",,False,,t5_2s5gk,1349158709.0,,,True,t3_10sz7d,http://www.reddit.com/r/lowcar/comments/10sz7d/the_irony_of_living_carfree_yet_lusting_after_a/,

So, we got our lock (three miles there and back) and went home and made our grocery list. We did a quick check of Google maps to determine the safest route to the grocery store and we were off. 5 miles later, we had the majority of our groceries, but had to visit a second store to procure some specialty items to compete our menu for the week. We dropped our purchases off at home and headed to the next store. After all was said and done, we had ridden ten miles for the first time and gotten groceries for the week without using any gas at all. Of course, we have a 2 year old that I pulled in a trailer which doubled as a grocery getter. I feel great for using my bike to get done what I would have normally used a car for.

I have a trek bike that could be cleaned up and fitted with an eZee or bionx -- I may explore that.  But I don't think it would handle a child very well.

**The Sacred Rac**

An Indian anthropologist, Chandra Thapar, made a study of foreign cultures with customs similar to those of his native land. One culture in particular fascinated him because it revered one thing as sacred—much as the people in India revere the cow. What he discovered might interest you.

The culture that Dr. Thapar studied is called the Asu and is found on the American continent to the north of the Terahumara of Mexico. Though the Asu seem to be a highly developed society in some ways, they are overwhelmingly preoccupied with the care of the rac, which is much like the bull in size and strength. In the Asu culture, it is almost a social obligation to own at least one rac. Anyone who owns none is held in low esteem by the community because he is too poor to maintain one properly. To display their wealth and social prestige, or importance, some members of the culture own large numbers of them.

Unfortunately, the rac can be less than healthy; sometimes they do not last more than five or seven years. Each family invests large sums of money yearly to keep its rac fit. There are rac specialists in each community—perhaps more than one if the community is particularly large or wealthy. These specialists, however, due to the long period of ritual training they must undergo, and due to the difficulty of obtaining the right selection of charms to treat the rac, demand costly offerings whenever a rac requires treatment.

At the age of 16, young people in the Asu community generally undergo a puberty rite in which a rac is a key component. A youth must petition a guardian. If the young adult is successful in the petition, then he or she is initiated into the ceremonies that surround the care of rac and is permitted to have time alone with, or even keep a rac.

Although the rac may be useful in assisting with labor, its prominence in the culture has created some conditions which other cultures would consider detrimental to the life of the society. In the first place, the rac population is increasing at a very rapid rate, and the Asu people have given little thought to curbing this growth. As a consequence, the Asu must build more paths for the rac to travel on, since its love of racing along with other rac at high speeds necessitates that special areas be set aside for its use. The cost of smoothing the earth is too costly for any one individual to undertake; thus, it has become a community project, and each Asu adult must pay an annual tax to build new paths and to maintain the old ones. There are so many paths needed that some people must move their homes because the rac paths must be as straight as possible to keep the racs from colliding and injuring one another.

Dr. Thapar also noted that, unlike the excrement of the cow, that of the rac cannot be used as either fuel or fertilizer. On the contrary, the rac excrement is exceptionally foul and totally useless. Worst of all, sometimes an owner is unable to control a rac which then runs down whatever is its path. Estimates are that the rac kills thousands of the Asu in a year.

Despite the high cost of its upkeep, the damage it does to the land, and its penchant for destructive rampages, the Asu still regard the rac as essential to the survival of their culture.

Fewer tumbleweeds, more cool discussions and sharing of news, tips, photos of bike setups, etc.

Which brings me to my next point. I am simply not cutting it as the sole moderator anymore! I have no concerns about poor comments or submissions or things like that. The issue is the spam filter. It gets filled up with lots of ""low carb"" spam, but then every so often a few (or a BUNCH) of legitimate posts also get sucked in, and I don't realize it until a week or two later. I always feel bad when this happens. **Will you help me?** Send me a message. Become a mod. If the spam filter could be glanced at even once every day or two, it would be a big improvement. It's very easy and straightforward to do -- it just needs to be done more frequently and consistently.

1317683977.0,9,self.lowcar,kzvwh,I recently had to give up my car and I have to say it's the best thing to happen to me in years! ,darkproteus66,9,0,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/lowcar/comments/kzvwh/i_recently_had_to_give_up_my_car_and_i_have_to/,"So due financial concerns I had to give up my car and have been no car for almost 2 months. I'm not going to lie, I was very upset when this initially happened if only due to the circumstances but I had wisely seen this earlier in the year as a possible outcome to my recent financial issues and made the very wise investment in a secondhand bicycle. Now almost 2 months later me having to give up my car has had a very positive effect on my life. Since I have started cycling almost everywhere I have been feeling a lot better not only health wise but also emotionally, I have more energy, feel less beat up all the time and am generally in a good mood almost all of the time now. 

Beyond that this has also had a very positive effect on my finances. My car alone was costing me $20 a month on gas, $330 a month on payments, and $140 a month on insurance. This isn't including all the junk food that I would justify purchasing when I was at the gas station, meaning that every month I am walking away with over $500 dollars extra in my pocket!

I'm not completely car free, my girlfrien who lives with me still has her car that we use for errands, but I can honestly say that 75% of the time I am now getting place to place on bike and honestly don't miss my car.

I'm not saying all this for accolades or karma but as a firsthand story that if you are thinking of going low car, no car, or who is drowning in debt thanks to a stupid car purchase (like me), that getting rid of your car isn't the end of the world (trust me I thought it was at first and I'm happier now) and you may just be healthier and happier without it!

I was living in a city, and for the most part I agree that the majority of the people living in a city and even in the suburbs do not need a car. I got everywhere on a bike and I even did costco runs on a bike.

So I am living in the mountains, on a tourist resort. There is a small store here but it lacks any produce what so ever. The next town is 30 miles away, one way. 60 miles a day was never a problem for me when I was living in the flats but since I am living at elevation and the 30 miles includes a lot of climbing it is not possible for me to make the bike ride an errand/supply run.

This is a seasonal job some I have no intentions on buying a car just to own for a few months before returning to the flats.

I have about 3 days of food left, and during my time here I will be relying of those with cars to help supply me with food. There are not shuttles that go from the resort to the town either.

1334342614.0,6,self.lowcar,s8bpt,Last night I went to a community meeting for a parking benefit district,dkesh,7,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/lowcar/comments/s8bpt/last_night_i_went_to_a_community_meeting_for_a/,"The district is in the West Campus neighborhood of Austin, Texas.  Those in favor were a mix of people who have read their Donald Shoup and believe in ending parking subsidies and commercial property owners who have a hard time finding tenants because their tenants' customers have a hard time finding parking.  The majority of the room was opposed to the new meters, but the major winning argument in favor was that the city would just go ahead and put meters in without dedicating any revenue back to the neighborhood otherwise.  

Toward that end, I find Professor Shoup's idea that parking benefit districts are a good political tool for adding meters somewhat flawed.  The commercial property owners needed no convincing and the residents felt just as rolled by the city as they would've if the city had just come in and set up the meters without the benefit district.

I really felt for some of the concerns that the residents had.  They saw the meters as not only hurting residents, because residents are better at scooping up parking spaces than outsiders are, but pretty much eliminating the possibility of resident parking even off-hours, because if you park at 7PM, you have to go out and feed the meter at 8AM.  Toward that end, I proposed that the city sell monthly passes for something similar to the market rate for off-street parking.  Additionally, there were some real concerns about spillover; because only part of West Campus will become metered, residents of the remaining free zones are very concerned that residents of the metered zones will start using street parking in the free zones as long-term parking.

Don't know if anybody is interested, but I just thought some of you out in carland should know that there are places where these ideas are being implemented; slowly, spottily, and unevenly, but seemingly inexorably.",,False,,t5_2s5gk,False,,,True,t3_s8bpt,http://www.reddit.com/r/lowcar/comments/s8bpt/last_night_i_went_to_a_community_meeting_for_a/,

Advice welcome...,defiancecp,7,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/lowcar/comments/1fcq7s/trial_by_fire_advice_welcome/,"So I'm moving from Little Rock to Seattle, and in the process moving to a much lower car lifestyle.  In little rock, infrastructure to travel using transit is minimal, spotty, and very poor quality, and bikes are VERY unwelcome on most city streets.  So my wife and I had little choice except to each have a vehicle (she had a Subaru WRX, I had a Nissan Leaf).  Our plan was to sell the WRX (done), keep the leaf, but try to move slowly over to relying primarily on transit, then find a nice commuter bike to supplement (I have a nice road bike, but my work doesn't have a particularly good bike parking facility so parking it there seems undesirable).

Bear in mind, I had ridden busses maybe 3-4 times in my *life* prior to our visits to Seattle - so I'm pretty much a complete transit newb.  When we've visited we made a point of using transit exclusively and didn't have major trouble (yay onebusaway and google maps :) ).  I'm also a pretty avid road cyclist, but almost exclusively on trails.  I'm relatively familiar with the laws regarding road cycling, but minimally experienced.


Well, events have conspired to make that plan unworkable - WRX is already sold and the leaf just developed issues, so for at least several weeks I absolutely won't have a car at all....   So it's cold-turkey time with the car :O

Anyway, figured since I no longer have the soft-transition option I expected, I need to ask for some advice!


Here's what we've done so far:  First we got orca cards and $2.25 passes for June.  Figure we'll definitely make enough use of them to justify that.

First priority I figure is commuting.  We'll be living in Seattle, right outside Volunteer park.  Wife works downtown, basically right near the library, and I work in Bellevue, near 2nd st &amp; 112th ave NE...  My wife's work is easy - bus (49) from less than a block from our new home to 5 blocks from her work runs every 15.  So she's 20 minutes out.  Looks like for me the best option to start with might be to ride the 49 to downtown and catch the 550.  Once I get a bike I can ride down broadway a bit, cut over to 12th, and take that the rest of the way to the I90 trail, then on the other side ride up 118th-&gt;114th-&gt;2nd.  Alternatively it looks like I could bike up to the montlake/520 area, catch a bus with across, then hop off and bike the rest of the way.  

With all that said, any recommendations for a bike shop and/or specific bike?  Since this is so time-pressing I hope to find something affordable that I can just buy, rather than dealing with the time needed to vet classified options.  

So that should get me commuting OK, but I guess my big worry is, we're moving in fresh, so no groceries etc.  I figure we'll need relatively big loads of groceries to start with, so I'm having trouble coming up with a way to handle that situation that *doesn't* involve renting a car...

Just to be honest, I was pretty comfortable with all this when I knew I'd have a car to fall back on, but now that's not the case I'm pretty nervous...  Heck, if the only advice you can give is to tell me I need to rent a car and stop whining, or that I'm not crazy and this is actually a solid plan -- anything helps, so long as I go into this somewhat informed...

Either way, whatever advice you might have, it's appreciated.  Thanks!!

For those who have considered the idea of bicycling as a means of transportation, some have an issue with safety. You may have seen cars with [these](http://www.janiceboling.com/lookTwice/images/lookTwice.jpg) bumper stickers. Though the idea is to promote motorcycle rider safety, it can also be applied to bicycle riders.

For strong proponents of bicycling to work, I am suggesting to you that information about safety and accidents between bicycle riders and drivers be shared on /r/lowcar frequently. I do not know any data off the top of my head about accidents, but if riding a bicycle is safer, it would be a worthwhile bit of information to share with those who are considering bicycle commuting.

Again, I am an outsider looking in (for not too much longer) and this is an idea to promote bicycle commuting. Thanks for reading, /r/lowcar.",,False,,t5_2s5gk,False,,,True,t3_1ezrfq,http://www.reddit.com/r/lowcar/comments/1ezrfq/car_vs_bicycle_accidents/,

I also don't have a decent car share where I live, but lots and lots of rental car places. 

I'm also a college student and don't really like driving or fancy paying for some crappy cheap car and dealing with the maintenance so that I can use it every once in awhile. 

I've use rental cars before and find them the be useful for my needs, but I hate paying $30 a day on top of everything else for insurance (I don't have my own auto-insurance policy since I don't drive). I think the rental price would be sweet if it weren't for that. 

If I were covered by my own policy it would be about $300 a year, which is nicer than the rental car costs. If I could just buy some no-car car insurance, or buy some insurance that I could also use to cover my bicycles that would also cover me if I wanted to rent a car, that would be nice. 

If not, then my idea is this: buy a project car for me to mess around with, possibly sans engine, get stationary registration, and insure it under pleasure use, and use that insurance policy on my car rentals too. 

Since I'm a college student I don't necessarily have the money to spend a bunch on working on a car, but I'm going to graduate in eight months, and at that point I could put more effort into the auto project and have a car to use if I wanted. I'd still want to bike commute, which works fine as long as I'm within 20 miles of my place of work. But I'd also have a sweet ride that I could bust out around town sometimes. 

Tell me r/lowcar is this crazy? Unnecessary if I can get transpo insurance policies that aren't tied to a vehicle? Should I just move up to San Francisco and live the dream?

But the question: is there anyone here that, like me, uses only the bike as means of transportation and, so, rides dozens of kilometers every single day? If so, next question:

Any of you use a lot the hands while biking? I use a lot and lot because one of my legs suffered necrose and is almost useless. If someone answered this with yes, the last question follows:

Any of you are having problems of numbness in one or more fingers, possibly the 4th and 5th of the left hands? If so, for how long? Hod did you solve it? 

I got a job recently more far away from home (some 12 kilometers), some months ago, and now my fingers are becoming numb. I am 29 years old and this is something new to me. I would not care about it if it was not for my biggest love: swimming in the lake. It is giving me troubles in the cold water, making it difficult to grab volumes of water.

So, anyone have any experience to tell me?

However, vehicles running on alternative fuels obviously have the same negative effects on cities and culture in general that more traditional vehicles have, and the only health benefit to driving with alternative fuels is the little bit of extra effort it takes to make / obtain your alternative fuel.

So what do y'all think?

I decided I had enough and it is time to execute it. Also, I will soon sell my apartment and I want to use part of the money for something decent.

THE IDEA:
A publicity campaign with 2 targets; first, to spread the conscience that the public streets are PUBLICS, and not exclusivity of noisy, dangerous, polluting private properties. That the public has the RIGHT to use them. That car owners have a gift PRIVILEGE to use them, witch does not override the public right, nor give them rights to put the public at risk. That the public right was stolen by drivers, and that the only way to take it back is with the public fighting for it.
Second, to advertise an internet forum yet to be created, whose objective is not to spread the ideas of less cars, but to give tips, debates, and create local movements to get this rights back. Like there are foruns discussing means to protect drivers from poors, this would discuss how people can protect them selves from drivers, without loosing their freedom to the car terrorism.

This would not be directed at drivers. I have no hope of convincing someone to respect others. Convincing someone that he has more rights then he knew (that he has the right to use the streets) is easy. Convincing someone that he has less rights then he knew (that he is not the owner of the streets) is impossible. People will only abdicate from power by force.

The campaign would only be for here, brasília, brazil. But if with success, others might want to replicate it.

THE MEANS:
I work doing 3d stills and movies for publicity, so I suppose I can create the campaign with a minimum acceptable quality (you can see my work here http://www.youtube.com/user/guismoale ). Also, like I said, I am selling my apartement and therefore I will be prepared to spend some 20 thousand reais or more (that is around 12 thousand dollars). This amount is not huge, but will get to some audience. And, who knows, I might get more money from ongs. But I am prepared to do this alone if I must. If I don't have attitude, how would I ask it from others?

The idea I have, is redoing this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvA-blNvSgY both in still and tv spots (if I can afford them), but replacing the tanks by suvs, other cars and motorcycles, all tank sized and spreading a lot of pollution, where it would read something like ""if YOU don't stop them, THEY won't stop themselves""
And them, maybe a litte explaining text and the forum link in the address. Pherphaps, I would replace the man in suit by a biker in suit.

I believe that, if it works very well, drivers will be much more aware of the danger they are, and that this ""peasants"" are willing to fight for their rights. So, even those that would not fight might get a better life and use of the streets trought the indirect consequences on the drivers. 

The reason I believe this, is that here in brasília we had years ago a governor that reinforced a legislation that allways existed; that if a pedestrian is in front of a crosswalk, the cars must stop, wether or not there is a sign nearby. The pedestrians began exercising this right and lifting their arms to cross and the drivers began to stop. And this city became the first (and almost the only) city in brasil where this is respected even today (mostly).

If it work midly well, there would be groups of people with more freedom, finding ways to use the streets, cross places withouth signs, ride bikes or be respected with new found ways of protecting themselves. Either in groups or alone.



WHAT I WANT FROM YOU:

I consider myself technically capable of doing the ads. But I am not creative, nor do I know much about all that this kind of job would involve. Legally, socially, or any other possible point I am missing. So, I would like you guys to tell me if the idea is stupid, if you have any suggestion, or if you know of any flaw. 

If I get this money I WILL do this. But I want to do this right. This will be a big sacrifice that I will probably never be able to repeat. So this HAS to work. Even if with just few people.

(X-post with r/bicycling),adambelanger,1,0,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/lowcar/comments/o0j3f/looking_for_a_large_tool_bag_that_can_be_worn/,"I'm stumped, and I think Reddit may be able to help me find a solution. I'm looking for a tool bag that I can carry while riding in the city. I'm not looking for a small bag to hold a multi-tool and spare tube. I'm looking for a good sized bag that can be worn messenger style to hold all my tools that I may need during a day of work. We're talking screwgun with 2 batteries and a charger, several different styles of pliers, screwdrivers, utility knife, hammer, a couple sizes of vice grips, an adjustable wrench, two sets of allen keys, small flashlight, scissors, measuring tape, a few rolls of 1"" tape, 1"" and 2"" spring clips and a few other small accessories. The bag should also be able to be set down on the ground and open wide to let me grab tools from it. Something around 18"" should suffice.

Something about this size:

The shoulder strap is poorly placed on that bag though, and is not comfortable to use messenger style. The overall size and wide opening are great but I would prefer if there were fewer pockets on the outside, since I'll be keeping most tools inside (so they don't fly out while riding.)

This bag has caught my eye, but I haven't gotten to see it in person.
[link](http://www.homedepot.com/h_d1/N-5yc1v/R-202017995/h_d2/ProductDisplay?langId=-1&amp;storeId=10051&amp;catalogId=10053)
It seems like it may not stand upright very well, since it has a narrow footprint.

This CLC bag seems like it'd be great. Lots of internal storage, a shoulder strap, good size opening and a bonus of being fairly waterproof. The problem that it's facing though is the far from positive reviews on Amazon, mostly citing the weak fabric and stitching. Has anybody had similar or contradictory experiences with this bag?
[link](http://goclc.com/ProductDetail.aspx?sku=1263)

Surprisingly, this Craftsman bag is quite comfortable on my back. There are several zippered compartments, but it doesn't exactly seem well designed. The pockets on the sides are an odd shape and the main compartment doesn't have many internal pockets. If this is the most comfortable bag I can find, I would have to resort to a tool roll or smaller zippered bags kept inside.

My username is NexusXtremeOne, but you can call me Nex.

I got out of college just when the economy crashed. I'm sure many here have experienced the problems described in the most recent issue of Newswseek (http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2012/07/15/are-millennials-the-screwed-generation.html) Upset, I figured that given a few years, things would return to normal and maybe be even better that ever.

Then I saw this: (http://2wanderlust.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/futurism-got-corn-graph-631-thumb.jpg?w=450&amp;h=368)

From the day we were born, we were fed a metanarrative. A narrative where everything was right with the world, everything would end with a happy ending, and everyone was special. Tyler Durden elaborated upon it:

&gt;*""I see in fight club the strongest and smartest men who've ever lived. I see all this potential, and I see squandering. God damn it, an entire generation pumping gas, waiting tables; slaves with white collars. Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need. We're the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War's a spiritual war... our Great Depression is our lives. We've all been raised on television to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won't. And we're slowly learning that fact. And we're very, very pissed off.""*

Long story short: Our generation and our future is doomed to the same scenario John B. Calhoun created in his mouse utopia.

That is why I am making this proposal. An alliance between subreddits with the aim of finding salvation for our generation and world. The Occupy movement has good ideas, but they're horribly organized and very prone to infiltration.The following are being considered as member candidates for this NexGen Alliance:
