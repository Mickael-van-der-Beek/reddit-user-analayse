**Part One: The Setup**

----

If someone had sat me down and told me, three years ago, when I signed up for Steam, that I would soon have nearly *five hundred* games in my account, I would have been downright joyous.

Five hundred games! Five *hundred* games! So much delight! So much joy! So much to play!

But, three years later, I'm not so much joyous as I am exhausted.

I decided a while ago that I wanted to ""clear"" my backlog. It wasn't an instantaneous decision, like one day I randomly decided ""hey, let's begin"", but it was more of a decision made out a sense of dread that weighed on me over time. I would play the games I had, and I was actually even pretty good about playing games that I ""needed"" to try out instead of dumping time into the same games over and over again.

But the problem was that the rate at which I was buying games far exceeded the rate at which I played them.

For some reason, I *kept buying games* even when I had plenty to play.

*Beyond* plenty.

Like *five hundred*.

Steam certainly didn't help, with its ridiculous giant sales where I'd pick up this and maybe that, and oh, that over there too! It was all so cheap that I didn't feel guilty, as it was easy to convince myself that ""I'd play it later"", in this sort of ideal future when I have all the time in the world to catch up on things I'd bought and then cast aside. It was also easy because it was so cheap -- I'd be practically *foolish* not to pick up that former $60 game at this single digit price.

But it wasn't Steam who rocketed my library count through the roof so much as it was bundles. They were my weakness. For the price of what *one* game was going for on a steep Steam sale, I could get *five*. Five! Or six or three or nine, depending on the offer. I started, as everyone did, with the Humble Bundles. They were high quality and committed to things that made me feel good for pretending to support, like DRM-free releases and Linux compatibility. Then came Indie Royale, which highlighted smaller indie games but, most importantly, always had one or two Steam keys per bundle, so of course I had to snag them. And then there was Indie Gala, which felt trashier and less polished, but it didn't matter because what they lacked in quality, they made up for in quantity, often offering eight or ten games for bottom-of-the-bargain-bin prices.

At the beginning, it all felt great. I was supporting my hobby by spending what appeared on the surface to be ""frugal"" amounts of money, and I was building a huge library that I'd have for the rest of my life because, as we all know, Steam is *forever*. I was playing lots of new games and acquiring lots more. It was great to be me.

But slowly, the bundles accelerated. The several-month gaps between Humble Bundles started diminishing. Indie Royale started churning them out every two weeks. More and more companies started entering the scene and suddenly I was also buying from Groupees and Bundle in a Box and Indie Face Kick, and the more I bought, the more I felt compelled to *keep* buying, because it felt like if I stopped, I'd miss out.

There was a point at which I realized that I was spending more time reading about games and sales online than I was actually playing games. Seeing a new bundle hit /r/gamedeals was nothing short of *thrilling*, but once the keys were activated and in my library, they just *sat there*.

There was another point, separate from the first, where I actually looked through my backlog and was legitimately aghast at just how those little purchases add up over time. Scrolling through my library, I stopped seeing individual games and instead saw a giant amalgam of things I'd never played in a quantity I could have never predicted. My library was the convergence of no-drop-feels-responsible-for-the-flood thinking and frog-in-a-frying-pan behavior, and it went from being something I was proud of to something I was ashamed of.

Instead of reveling in my immediate access to hundreds of games, I started to feel *bad* about it. It didn't represent a vast, untapped goldmine of entertainment; it was instead a monument to my lack of self-restraint and my terrible consumer habits. It said that I'd willingly throw money at whatever anyone could offer me, as long as it was cheap and had Steam keys. It said I had issues in real life for which buying games was my remedy. It said that I would continue to make the same mistake over and over again, despite being acutely aware of what I was doing. I felt judged by people despite having nearly nobody on my friends' list and a profile that I'd made private out of shame. It wasn't that anyone was actually judging me, but it was more of an ""if they knew"" kind of thing, where the moment ""they"" saw the number of games I had ""they'd"" immediately know how vulnerable and foolish I was.

And, of course, ""they"" would judge me for that.

Which made me feel worse, so I did what everbody would do: I did something that made me feel good in response. I bought more games.

Unfortunately, a byproduct of my purchasing habits was that I stopped enjoying *playing* games as much as I should. Whenever I was playing a game, I felt the weight of my backlog, and I would often feel guilty for playing a game I enjoyed and had played for a while when there were so many that I hadn't even touched. It felt like I should have been spending time with them instead. Even when I wasn't playing games, I felt the shadow of my backlog behind me. I looked at any free time as hours that were best utilized by sinking them into my massive library. I often sat through social situations flummoxed at how much *time* I was spending *not* putting time into my Steam library. Four hours of hangout time was time that I could have spent beating an indie game! And when we'd play something on console, I'd secretly lament that the time ""didn't count"" because it wasn't counting towards any sort of Steam completion. It didn't matter if I was having a legitimate blast, because when it was all over, it still ""didn't count"" towards that unattainable, idealized goal I had always had for myself: to actually play the games I bought.

Sometime last year I started making a good-faith effort towards playing the games that I had. I still had in my mind the false notion that I could ""complete"" every single game in my library; it was just going to require *lots* of dedicated effort on my part. I would sit down with a game, play it through to the credits, and then hop onto the next one, often choosing easy, small indie games that were completable in a few hours. And it went like this for maybe fifteen or twenty games, at which point my idealism broke.

If a game took me, on average, five hours to complete (and that's probably a very low estimate), then the remaining 250 or so games would take me 1250 hours. That's not that much, right? People regularly have more time than that in Team Fortress 2 and Counterstrike. And that's a mere pittance in World of Warcraft, right?

I broke it down: if I played nothing but backlog games for eight hours a week, it would take me 156 weeks to finish everything. *One hundred and fifty six weeks*! That's *three years*! Okay, think for a moment: maybe I could get it down by raising the time? I play games more than 8 hours a week anyway, right? What if I played 10 hours a week? Two-and-a-half years. Okay, twelve? Only two years. That's better. Still a lot though. Let's go for the gold: what about a whopping twenty hours a week?

*Over a year*.

Twenty hours a week is basically a part-time job. On top of my regular full-time job, of course. And, not only that, but that was only if I played *nothing* but backlog games. For 20 hours a week. And that was only if they all landed at a length of somewhere around five hours, which was a tenuous assumption to say the least.

Doing the actual math was humbling, as it put into perspective just *what* trap I'd fallen into. I'd been buying games under the assumption that ""some day"" I'd be able to get around to them, but instead I'd dug myself a hole that actually *prevented* that ""some day"" from ever happening. There never would be a glorious moment when I was free to play whatever my heart desired because I was always saddling my heart with more and more desires while simultaneously letting it only pursue one at a time. Slowly.

It was at that point that I dropped the idea of ""completing"" my backlog, as completing every game was simply an unfeasible task for me, not to mention a rather foolish one. After all, there were plenty of games I'd played that I *didn't* want to complete. I'd stopped them because I didn't enjoy them, because they flat out didn't work, or because I'd gotten bored of what they had to offer.

So *completing* games was an unfeasible goal, but what about just *trying* them?

Somewhere, somehow, I settled on ""an hour"" as my goal for a game. With 250 games still untouched, that was still a substantial amount of time, but even at a low 8 hours a week, it would take me roughly half a year. What I wanted to do was give each game an hour of my time, let it offer me what it had to offer, and if at the end of an hour I wanted to keep playing, I would. If I didn't, well, I could move on from the game with the satisfaction of knowing that it wasn't for me, as I'd given it a good-faith effort.

I wanted to do it because I felt I ""owed"" it to those games, certainly, but really I wanted to do it because I wanted a way to be free from my crushing backlog. It was exhausting me, and just ignoring it wasn't an option somehow. As much as I tried to just forget that it was there, I was constantly reminded of it.

But I really wanted to do it so that I could break my bad habits. Like parents who catch their kid with cigarettes and force him to smoke the whole pack so he'll hate it and never do it again, I wanted to force myself to ""play my whole library"". So that I'd never buy games haphazardly again.

----

**Part Two: The Process**

----

In looking to ""clear"", rather than ""complete"" my backlog, I set the following rules for myself:

* Each game's time counter, according to Steam, had to reach at least an hour.

This was for practical purposes, as you can sort your Steam library by time played in your profile, and I would use that mode to pick out games. Anything that was below the ""1.0 hrs on record"" mark needed to be played until it moved up the ladder.

* If I liked a game, keep going!

It's sad that this had to be a rule for me, but I'd be lying if I didn't admit that a huge part of me was tempted to go through the motions, putting an hour into every single game and then calling it a day (or, in this case, a year). The problem with this was that I legitimately *did* want to play, to completion, a lot of the games in my library. I'd just never gotten around to them, especially the ones that required larger time committments or moved at a slower pace. Before this whole ""clear my backlog"" project, it was hard for me to put more than two or three hours in most games, as, at that point, I'd start to want to jump to the next, trying out all the different things I'd wanted to get around to in my library.

* I could idle to an hour only if the game didn't work, or it was so far from my tastes that a full hour of playing it became tedious.

This rule kind of sounds like cheating, but I can assure you it isn't. Because this whole project was self-imposed, I knew that if I tried to cut corners, even after finishing I wouldn't be satisfied that I'd really done what I set out to do. I'd just feel guilty about cheating my backlog clear, rather than guilty about the backlog itself. Furthermore, the idling rule wasn't one I actually set out with, but one that came about partway through the project as a practicality. Some games just don't run well (especially older games on newer hardware), and while I would legitimately *try* to get every game running (PCGamingWiki was invaluable for this), I wasn't about to burden myself greatly for not playing games where that wasn't possible.

I also wasn't going to frustrate myself for a full hour with a game I legitimately didn't like. But, to avoid the possibility that I could cut corners by nexting games two minutes in and just alt-tabbing to something else for the rest of the time, I also came up with the corresponding rule that if I *was* idling in a game I didn't like, I at least had to spend that time looking up information on the game. So, in the few cases (probably 10 or so) where I idled for the last 20 or so minutes of my requisite hour, I'd spend the time reading the game forums or looking up reviews to see how others felt about it. I hadn't technically played the game for an hour, but I had legitimately dedicated a full hour to the game, which, in my mind, still counted.

Many would probably argue that it takes far less than an hour to discern whether or not you're into a game, and, after having gone through this, I'd say that's probably accurate. What I wanted to accomplish in setting that as a threshold was to avoid the situation where I played a game for four minutes, didn't like the tutorial or first level or whatever, and then moved on. I've found that many games take *time* to kind of open up and show you what they have to offer, especially when the first part of the game is them laying out their story and mechanics for you. Most games, I would argue, try really hard to make us care about them, but that takes *time* and isn't usually doable inside of 10 minutes.

I found this to be true when I went back and tried to play the *numerous* games in my Steam library that I'd only put a couple of minutes into. In forcing myself to play them for an hour, I started to like them more and realized that my initial hesitations were less indicative of the ""quality"" of the games and more of my familiarity with them. They say it breeds contempt, but I feel like that's probably true for times greater than one hour, as most of the games I played I liked *more* as I got more accustomed to them and comfortable with what they were having me do.

If I had to do it again, I would probably set my threshhold time at half an hour, as that seems like the sweet spot where I'd authentically realize whether or not I was going to want to keep going with a game, as it tended to be at that point where I would start idling in games I really didn't enjoy and turn to the forums in hopes someone could help me see what I was missing. It also would have chopped out at least 100 hours of game time. Again, it doesn't sound like that much, but that's four *full days* of gaming. That's over *twelve* eight-hour game weeks.

According to Steam, I have 479 games in my Steam library. Partway through this project, I started keeping my own spreadsheet, and it lists 472. The discrepancy in counting comes from a couple of ""games"" I opted to eliminate from the running, like the old version of Company of Heroes and playable betas for games like Defcon and Chivalry: Medieval Warfare.

Of those 472 games, exactly 200 (a coincidence, not my doing by choice) sit at 1.0 or 1.1 hours played (I hit 1.1 in a lot of games because I would often stop not *exactly* at the 60 minute mark, but instead when I finished a particular level/conversation, or when I got to a savepoint, running me slightly over the threshhold).

If I were to say something about all of them in aggregate, it would be that, by and large, games aren't as terrible as people seem to argue at large that they are. I see a lot of complaining about review inflation and ""shitty"" this or that and pet peeves and whatnot, but, by and large, most of the games I put only an hour into I didn't pursue not because they were ""bad"" but simply because they ""weren't for me"". This was further driven home by the fact that I checked the forums for almost every game I played, and there were almost always people there that legitimately loved it. Every little niche game has its own little niche following and loyalties, and while those groups can often be caustic or rabid, I think that comes from a (maybe misguided) sense of protection.

It was part of the problem that fed my buying habits, as when nearly *any* game goes on sale, seemingly counter to the constant aggregate complaints about game quality, there are people who will individually attest to that particular game's individual quality, the amount of time they put into it, and why you should definitely get it because at that price it's a total steal. /r/gamedeals is a wonderful subreddit and I still love it dearly, but part of the problem with it is that almost *every* deal will have down-to-earth commenters giving wonderful sounding affirmations, making every sale seem like a diamond in the rough.

If I could say something about gamers in aggregate, it's that trying these 200 games has shown me that gamers have *very* different tastes and habits, and the best thing you can do when considering what games to buy is to not take at face value what other people have to say, but instead consider what they're saying in light of *what you know about your own habits*. Don't buy a game because someone else says it's good; buy it because you believe it'll be good *for you*. It's not that they're wrong or anything -- I legitimately do believe them when they say a game is good -- it's just what what's good for me and what's good for them *probably* aren't the same things.

It's a super relativist way of looking at things, I know, but my problem was that, without that personal lens, I was trying to drink from the firehose and buy *every* game that *anyone* said was worthwhile, for fear of missing out on something truly grand.

Now, of course, aside from those 200 one-hour games, I also played, to completion, a *lot* of games I'd been meaning to play for *years*. The ones that I either *knew* were going to be a good fit for me (The Longest Journey, Beyond Good &amp; Evil) or that I knew were ""too important"" to pass up (Half-Life 2, Mass Effect).

According to my spreadsheet, I've completed (as in finished the campaign/story of) 179 games, or 37.7% of my library. That sounds low, but I'm okay with ""1 in 3"", especially considering how many games I have that aren't really my taste and also considering that there are plenty of games in the ""not complete"" category that I've played and love dearly but that I can't and won't be able to actually finish (like Super Meat Boy).

Of course, many of these 179 were finished before my backlog-clearing project began, but a good number of them came about because of it, and they were ones that, without this dedication, I likely would have kept putting off indefinitely, as I had for years before.

In terms of buying habits, I wish I could say that I'd about-faced and stopped buying new games the moment after I'd had my terrible realization about the magnitude of my library, but it was more of a gradual descent into self-control. My bundle buying habit was the hardest to break, and it was legitimately difficult for me the first time I forced myself to skip a Humble Bundle. In the few bundles I've bought since then, I've only activated keys for games I've legitimately *wanted* to play, rather than just bulking it and adding 4 or 5 games that I kind of maybe might want to play sometime in the future, perhaps.

In fact, it's turned into another ""rule"" for myself that I only buy games that I'm legitimately interested in playing. Not a game that looks cool at first glance, not a game that tons of people said was great on some forum somewhere, but a game that kind of gets under my skin and stays there over time. Something I see that sparks something inside of me, and that I haven't already forgotten about two days later.

And it's a rule that's serving me well: this past Steam sale was the first big sale where I've not purchased *anything*.

----

**Part Three: After**

----

So, now that I've successfully cleared my Steam backlog, where does this leave me?

Well, for one, I'm gonna break a bit from videogames. I've been binging on them for months now, filling every empty gap of free-time playing them, often foregoing sleep and other duties in order to get done what I ""needed"" to get done. I'll still play them, of course, but it's going to happen in a much less calculated manner and in a (hopefully) much more fun one. I'm bringing back some much needed balance in my life, and I've started reading, writing, and exercising again like I used to. If you were to pit the number of games I've played this year against the number of books I've read, journal entries I've written, AND times I'd been to the gym, it'd still be a massacre, which is a shame.

I'm also going to change my buying habits. For a while, it's concerned me that I'm only willing to pay the rock bottom prices for things that I love. I didn't ever really have a reason for it other than the fact that it felt good, as it wasn't ever out of necessity -- I'm gainfully employed and I have a disposable income. What makes me feel bad about it, however, is both the fact that I end up spending *more* than I would normally (it just feels like less because the hits are smaller), and the fact that, in return for getting access to games made dutifully and often lovingly by developers, I'm giving mere pennies to middlemen.

To the first point, I decided, after clearing my backlog, to go back into my accounts and find out just how much money I really have spent. I added up everything that went to Steam or the bundlers (as I, of course, *never* buy direct from the developer).

And I ended up with a whopping $1516.36.

For perspective, across three years, that's *more than a dollar per day*. People always like to joke about how ""this game is less than a cup of coffee!"". Well, turns out games *were* my daily cup of coffee.

Now, for 472 titles (actually more, since a lot of them are only on Desura and not Steam), that's not a ""bad"" total, coming out at a mere $3.21 per game. But it's a lot more expensive when you consider that I had to *twist my own arm* in order to play at least *two hundred* of them. What really surprised me in looking back at my account histories, however, was that I used to actually buy games at higher prices. I gave $50 ($50!) for the first Humble Bundle, presumably because I thought it was *worth that much*. Later ones I paid $15 and $10 for. Then $5. Then $2. I used to have no problem paying full price for things in the past, even considering something as low as $20 a bargain, but now it's all $2.50 here, a buck there, and *very* little more.

What had happened was that I wasn't really using Steam to buy games so much as Steam *was* the game, and I was parceling out big chunks of my income through microtransactions, buying every little ""expansion pack"" that came along and offered me keys to expand my library. I've never played one of those widely hated fee-to-play or pay-to-win games that we see commonly on mobile/social platforms, but I'll be damned if I don't recognize that I was executing the *exact same behavior* as players of those games, just by a different medium.

And this bothers me because it makes me feel partly like I've been taken for a sap, as fifteen-hundred full, real-life dollars left my pocket with me smiling all the way and in fact *begging for more*. But it mostly bothers me because I realize that of all those games I've played, so many of them are made and toiled away on by people who got basically *nothing* in return from me. My buying habits, as is, aren't supporting what I want to support, and I know there are tons of indie developers out there hurting right now because of course nobody wants to buy their game unless it's on Steam, and, even if it is, they'll just get it when it's in the bundle they can pick up for a dollar.

I feel like, from here on out, I'm going to end up buying *less* games at *higher* prices, because it feels like the right thing to do from both sides. I have no issue with compensating people for their work, and I have no issue with paying out what I can to support the things I love, but for the three years I've been doing this Steam library bloat dance, I've been negligent on my part and my purchasing has been solely motivated by ""what can get me the *most* for the least money"".

I also feel like I'm going to move away from Steam. I wish I could say it's completely noble and that I want to support independent development and DRM-free games and all that, but, honestly, I just want to be away from a system that tracks my playtime. With Steam's cumulative counters for every game you've played, I feel like playing *any* Steam game fuels into some metagame because it's ""accounted for"". I realize that's partly self-created, as it's the metric I ended up using for my project, but that happened *because* the game-time tracking was already there. Having Steam count my time feels like the ""observation changes the experiment"" phenomenon on a personal level, and I want to be out from under the thumb of tracking every minute of my hobby. I don't do it with books, music, television, or movies, and I wish I could just turn off that option in Steam so it would be possible with games too.

I also feel like I'm going to move away from them because I'm not sure I like where they're headed. The trading cards intitiative is, for lack of a better word, frightening to me. It, again, metagames your Steam library, only this time in a very deliberate way. Furthermore, it ties directly into real-world money and social progression to the point that I feel like if we saw this same behavior from any other less beloved company, you'd be seeing a *lot* more people rising up in protest. The difference is, of course, we, deep down inside, *like* Steam this way, which is exactly how I used to feel about all that money I was throwing at game sales.

I had a sobering moment a while ago where I'd logged into Steam on a different computer and forgotten that I'd done that. When I returned to my main, Steam had a message about ""another session"" and had, as it's supposed to, logged me off. For a brief moment, I thought I'd lost my account to the hands of someone who'd gotten into my email or figured out my password or something, and, for a brief moment, it felt like I'd been gut-punched, as the whole ""Steam is forever"" idea works only when your account is still yours. I realize this is a flaw with Desura and GOG too, given that they're also hinged on account security, but at least with those I can keep local backups of the games I've already bought. And at least with them, most will run *without* the account itself. It's not ideal, as I'd stop getting updates and lose access to the benefits that a centralized distribution platform gives, but at least it wouldn't be a $1500 blow that leaves me with *nothing*.

It really made me rethink the whole eggs-in-one-basket philosophy I'd held to, as my giant repository of digital games started to feel like a liability instead of an asset. I also realized, largely because of the games I'd picked up by proxy on Desura through the Indie Royale bundles, that by limiting what I played to what was on Steam, I was cutting out huge swaths of worthwhile games that didn't have the luck or appeal to make it onto everybody's favorite distribution service. I was also limiting the platforms I was playing on, as I hadn't touched my consoles in forever, and when I did I couldn't enjoy what I was playing because it felt like I was ""wasting"" time.

But, all pontifications aside, I'm looking forward to playing games strictly because I enjoy them again. What I did opened me up to a lot of worthwhile stuff that I'd probably wouldn't have gotten around to, and I'm definitely glad for the perspective that playing such a wide swath of titles has given me, but I miss playing games for *fun* or for *enrichment*. I miss the allure of waiting anxiously for a new game to come out. I miss diving into games for hours at a time instead of leap-frogging between them, anxious that I'd never play them all. I miss dedicating myself to a single title and seeing all it has to offer, loving it for its highs and figuring out just how it tries to cover up its lows. Gaming has the potential for so much joy, delight, and wonder, and I feel like I've been closed off to those for a long time. I'm looking forward to rekindling them.

I do legitimately feel great for clearing my backlog. It's nice and freeing, and it has that kind of finality to it that gives it weight. I'm *done*. I'm *finished*. I'm now free to go play what I want to.

But I also think I could have reached that point without going to such ridiculous lengths. The experience was a good way to make myself learn a lesson, but I pretty much learned it halfway through and could have probably stopped there. And yes, I did play a lot of worthwhile games, but I'd also read a lot of worthwhile books if you forced me to read whatever's on your shelf. The real value isn't so much in the particular games I played but more in coming to terms with the fact that I shouldn't have to feel like it's my duty to *consume everything*. An unplayed game isn't a sin, and I'll be able to live my life comfortably even if I'm not familiar with those games that ""everyone"" plays.

Anyway, I realize this was very long (yet I feel like I only said 10% of what I wanted to), but if you made it through to the end, thanks for taking the time to read it. I'd love to hear any questions or comments.",,False,,t5_2sgq6,False,,,True,t3_1jg15u,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1jg15u/so_i_actually_cleared_my_massive_steam_backlog/,
1361956400.0,1073,self.truegaming,19bhun,An in-depth Analysis of the Score from Portal 2,Randomtask3000,1311,238,118,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/19bhun/an_indepth_analysis_of_the_score_from_portal_2/,"Please keep in mind that this was written for musicians, and therefore includes much explanation of the game mechanics of portal 2 which you may not find necessary. Likewise, some musical terms may be unfamiliar. I'm happy to answer any questions. 


The score for Portal 2 more than just a well composed score, it is also an elegant solution to many of the problems posed by contemporary game design, especially in a game which is as mind-bending as Portal 2. By using a variety of short loops with varying rhythmic, tonal and timbral relationships to each other, Portal 2’s score is highly reactive in a way that feels seamless, provides player feedback which is incredibly subtle yet highly effective, and has a near constant music presence which reflects the changing environment in a way which doesn't feel repetitive or command too much attention.

Conventional video game scores mimic film scores in many respects. They strive to be grand, and exciting, and to reflect the action on screen. Much like most action movie scores, they make use of modern and post-modern techniques in a romantic framework.
 
However, video game music has two unique challenges: memory budget, and non-linearity.
A game score has strict time limitations. Whereas a two hour film could theoretically have music for its entire duration, a game score is strictly limited, with a budget of roughly 1.5 hours. Most modern games strive to give the player a median 20 hour experience. Game composers rely heavily on looping to fill the gaps. They must also write music which can be used to reflect a variety of situations, depending on the linearity of the game.

In a conventional modern game score, there are three primary musical event types: state changes, location changes, and stings. In game music, a state is a way of reflecting major changes in the game. In a stealth game, for instance, two major states might be “undiscovered”, and “discovered”. The music will then change to reflect the change in state. Games which are less linear, such as Skyrim rely more on state changes to have a reactive score (because many different things can happen in the same place).Location refers both to a game’s levels, and different areas within that level. Games which are more linear, such as Uncharted, utilize more location based music, because areas are typically used for a single purpose. Stings are short musical segments which reflect recurring events. Some arcade games only had stings, which were often referred to as the “opening theme” or “game-start” music, and the “kill screen” or “game-end” music.

While Portal 2 is built from the same basic theory as the one described above, its aesthetic is very different. It does not sound or feel like a film score, and is much more interactive. Where a conventional game score might switch between tracks to represent a state change, Portal 2’s score goes much further.

 
Portal 2 is a first-person puzzle platformer. What this means is that the game is in first person view, with the player directly controlling the camera, the environments the player encounters are of themselves interactive puzzles, and most of these puzzles are concerned with transporting the player from the beginning of the level to the end. In Portal 2, the player must traverse an abandoned research laboratory using a portal gun which, when fired, creates 2 corresponding portals on any surface,
(i.e., if the player fires one portal on a far wall, and then another portal directly beneath them, they will fall through it and emerge through the portal on the far wall.)

One of Portal 2’s strongest features as a game score is it’s reactivity to the environment and to events. The point of a reactive score is to use your music to tell the story of what the player is doing, which requires using measurable game events to trigger musical events. While most games achieve this by switching between tracks or with musical stings, Portal 2 achieves this through procedural mixing, alterations to the music which is currently playing.
Some puzzles use a structure built into the floor called a ‘faith plate’. The faith plate instantly springs the player into the air, either directly upwards or with forward, backward or lateral direction. These are used to cover great distances and as puzzle elements.

In the level which introduces the faith plate mechanic, the music in the background is quiet, not demanding too much attention, either blending in with the background drone of machinery or simply being the background drone of machinery, it isn’t too clear which. When the player steps onto the faith plate and is rocketed to the air, a previously silent percussive musical loop begins to crescendo in relation to the player’s height. This loop is highly distorted covering a variety of frequency ranges. The distortion doesn't sound like natural harmonic distortion but rather the digital distortion which results when the amplitude of a sound is too great to be represented by the bit depth of the file. The result is that the percussive loop is aggressive and computational sounding. When the player reaches maximum height and begins to descend, the loop fades out and is subsumed by a quieter loop which continues the musical pulse but is far less aggressive. This all takes about four seconds.

The overall effect of this is intensification of the action of flying through the air. The rush of wind and the ground falling away from you is fairly exciting stuff, but it’s all the more adrenaline inducing when accompanied by a swell of crunchy aggressively beating percussion. The fact that a less aggressive loop with the same pulse continues upon landing avoids a jarring transition back to near silence, and also gives a subtle sense that the thrill of flying is still lingering as residual adrenaline. This mechanic is used in many levels and is usually accompanied by the same musical idea, though often with rhythmic and timbral variations.

In a later level, the background music consists of a synthesized harpsichord piece meant to emulate the counterpoint of J.S. Bach’s music. When the player steps on the faith-plate and is sent into the air, instead of a percussion track fading in and out, the harpsichord track is subsumed by the same music being performed simultaneously on an array of aggressive electronic sounds. Because both the electronic track and the harpsichord track are playing simultaneously with the electronic track being silent until called upon by the faith plate, the electronic track can fade in seamlessly and be perfectly timed with respect to the harpsichord track.

There is another structural mechanic called the ‘excursion tunnel’. The excursion tunnel is a large translucent blue cylinder with helical waves on the outside of it, and functions much like tractor beams in science fiction. It is extends from a projector on the wall. Once the player steps into it, they are held aloft within it and slowly drift away from the projector.

Once inside the excursion tunnel, any music occurring within the level is replaced with a specific music track just for the excursion tunnel. The track consists mostly of a low drone with several overtones as well as other higher tones that swell and fade slowly. At times there is a slow simple major pentatonic melody in the alto range. There can also be a percussive loop consisting of various high pitched chirps and clicks. The overall effect is of comfort, relaxation and soothing, as though floating in the excursion tunnel is a welcome break for the player from the more intense music present in the levels.

In some puzzles, the player is able to redirect the flow of special paints called ‘gels’ which alter the properties of the surfaces to which they are applied. For instance, the ‘repellent gel’ makes any surface to which it is applied bouncy, allowing the player to reach new areas when it is not possible to “portal” there. The repellent gel resembles a thick bubbly blue paint.
 
In the level which introduces the repellent gel, the background music consists of eighth note arpeggios in slow 6/8 time which progress with a 2 measure harmonic rhythm. They are played on an electric keyboard resembling a Fender Rhodes (reflecting the retro feel of the level.) When the player bounces on the gel, the player briefly hears the same chords being played an octave higher in 32nd notes.

The effect is one of elation. The constant modulation of the chords creates anticipation, and suddenly hearing much faster 32nd note arpeggios as you bounce is a surprise, which relieves the tension.
Giving Feedback

The technique of altering the music currently playing in order to react to the player can also be used to give player feedback. Feedback in video games has a slightly different meaning than everyday use. Broadly, feedback refers to the multitude of ways in which the game informs the player about the game world, and responds to player input. Ideally, the player must always know when they’ve affected the world, and should be able to anticipate the reaction of various elements within it.
Most game feedback is visual, such as the running animations of a player character to reflect the player’s decision to move. It can also be audible, as in dialogue, or sound effects. Lastly, it can be sensory, which usually uses vibration motors.

Sometimes the feedback must be represented as text on the screen. This is called the GUI (graphic user interface). While often necessary, modern developers strive to have as little GUI as possible, and feedback techniques which can reduce the necessity of the GUI are treasured. Using a GUI where other feedback will do is seen as counter-productive to the establishment of immersion. The ubiquitous health-bar of first-person shooters was replaced seemingly overnight by other techniques deemed more immersive: in Call of Duty, as the player loses health, blood splatter appears on the edges of the screen. In Left 4 Dead, the screen goes black-and-white.

Portal 2’s score also gives feedback. Most crucial is it’s feedback with respect to the player’s completion of the level. In a game as mind-bending as portal, anything which helps give the player some sense of their progress is vital in the effort to get the player to complete the level without having to consult a guide.

Some of the puzzles have the player redirecting a laser beam into an electric eye or cylindrical sensor, through which it may pass and hit other objects (whereas the eye is always mounted on a wall). When the laser enters the eye or cylinder, it will often affect another part of the puzzle, such as opening doors or raising platforms. The third chamber of Chapter 3 requires that the player direct a single laser into three cylindrical sensors. They must use portals, and a lens, called the “redirection cube”, which can change the angle of the beam.

The ambience in this chamber is quieter than most, and is overwhelmed by the ominous tenor buzz of the laser. Once the player has successfully directed the laser into a single sensor, it begins to emit a short sonorous ostinato consisting of three upward perfect fourth leaps, the second of which is a major second higher than the first, and the third of which is a major second higher than the second.
Upon redirecting the laser into a second sensor (without directing it away from the first one) the same ostinato is emitted, though this time slightly faster so that the two phase with each other. The third sensor emits the same ostinato except considerably faster and transposed up an octave. All three of these loops begin with the same pitch which is being generated by the buzzing laser.
The introduction of new patterns based on puzzle milestones is an elegant solution to the problem of representing a non-linear media (video games) using a linear art form (music.) And because the phase takes a long time to complete, it also avoids becoming too repetitious, which is important because players may find themselves in this chamber for a long time. Because the loops are so short, the level generates this long piece of music with very little source material, which is an elegant solution to the problem of scoring a long game while staying within your budget for memory. Finally, the sweet sound of the loops helps to soothe the player from the grating sound of the laser, which makes the resulting music a reward for completing the level.  

The first chamber of Chapter 3 has multiple steps and uses all of the mechanics the player has learned so far (including the redirection of lasers into electric eyes, faith plates, and cubes) so the feedback role of the music is even more vital here.

The music upon entering is a sparse, quiet, metallic percussion loop. It blends somewhat with the mechanical ambience which comes with each chamber. The player walks to a nearby faith plate, and is shot into the air and forward. This event is accompanied by the familiar fade-in of the aggressive electronic percussion. By the time the loop has faded out, the player has hit a wall and is in a new part of the chamber.  Nearby in this new area, a laser is being projected into an electric eye. The signage indicates that the electric eye is activating the wall. This impedes the player’s progress, so the laser must be blocked. While standing next to the laser, a non-tonal harsh synthesized loop is audible, fading out as the player gets further away from it. The player must portal to a third area to acquire a storage cube to block the laser. The cube is being playfully tossed about by a robotic section of the wall. The robotic movement is accompanied by another synthesized loop. When the player grabs the cube, the wall section retreats and the music ceases, leaving only the original metallic loop. With the cube, the player steps on the faith plate again. Now that the laser is blocked and the wall retracted, the player flies further to another faith-plate, which sends them into the air again to another area previously hidden. This time, the percussive loop fades in slightly louder and more aggressively before the player hits another wall. Now the player learns that they must redirect the laser which they previously blocked to a second, previously unseen, electric eye, which retracts the second wall. The activation of this second electric eye starts another synthesized loop similar to the first one. The player makes the long walk back to the first faith plate for the third and final time. This time, the full sequence of the three faith-plate percussion cues is heard, each louder and more aggressive than the last. All three of these jumps take the player past the recently activated electric eye, so the new laser loop fades in and out with the faith-plate loops. The player finally lands at the end of the level, near the exit door. Here, as in most areas to which one travels by faith-plate, the music is minimal, consisting only of the original loop we heard upon entering, with some added slightly more organic percussion to add a note of conclusiveness.

The musical effect is of an in-your-face non-tonal electronic percussion gesture which occurs intermittently, linearly increasing in length each time until finally being completed. This reflects the journey the player takes while completing the puzzle, seeing gradually more of the chamber until finally reaching the end. These gradually lengthening gestures are separated by long periods of relative calm with the occasional appearance of a quiet agitated melody. The effect on the gameplay is that the music feels steadily more complete as the player reaches the solution to the puzzle. The major steps in the larger solution each have their own musical milestone. (Reaching the storage cube, deactivating and later reactivating the laser, etc.) Furthermore, seeing the music grow gradually more and more complete becomes a reward for the player.

I cannot stress enough the importance of this kind of feedback. In the developer commentary for Portal 2, as well as its predecessor, nearly every remark by the development team mentions their extensive play testing process. They use play testing to ensure that puzzles are balanced in their difficulty, and that they provide the necessary cues to subtly lead the player to the solution.
Mood

Portal 2’s score also supports the mood of the game. It is not merely an experimental reactive music engine, achieving this high reactivity and feedback at the expense of fidelity to the atmosphere. At the very beginning of the game, the player is just entering the dilapidated broken down Aperture laboratories. Vines are growing everywhere, the chambers are littered with stagnant pools of water and are full of natural light.
The primary instrumentation is harp, low flute, and female chorus. It uses the whole tone scale with the tonal center modulating periodically. As the player travels further into the facility, and the encroachment of nature becomes less apparent, these more organic sounding musical loops are joined by saw and square wave synthesizers. Some of them are simply doubling the other parts (the harp for instance is doubled). Others are joined by heterophonic variations.
The effect is that the player has some sense of leaving behind the natural world as they enter deeper and deeper into Aperture. The whole tone tonality sounds mysterious, and this is reinforced by the moderate tempo which sounds cautious.

There are some moments in the game which require the player to move quickly. These sections are less puzzle intensive. This feels very different from the rest of the game which ordinarily allows the player as much time to contemplate the brain-gelatinizing puzzles as they require. The commentary for Portal talks about using mechanics the player has already learned in time sensitive situations to give a more “action movie” type stimulation while giving the brain a break from the rigors of “thinking with portals”.
In these situations, the music speeds up considerably, using some of the musical language of techno. This includes 4/4 meter with bass kick on each beat, use of syncopation in the higher voices, two-chord harmonic structure. The speed of the music is an excellent cue to the player that they need to move quickly, and is also an effective reflection of the urgent feeling of the level. The music here is also much less locally reactive. If there is any reaction at all other than it starting at the beginning of the level and ceasing at the end, I can’t perceive it. But this is appropriate because these faster levels are a much more linear experience themselves. The player isn’t altering the environment much, they are simply moving from point a, to point b.

On a broader scale, the instrumentation undergoes significant changes as the player reaches the three major story milestones, which also coincide with changes in gameplay. The first section makes the quick transition from spooky and organic to spooky and electronic, with most of the electronic sounds being harsh and “crushed” sounding. At times the electronic percussion sounds so robotic, it is not clear if any of the percussive sounds are meant to resemble the components of the typical drum set, or even if they are meant to take on the roles of those component. Instead it sounds more like a collection of high and low noisy oscillations have been assembled with no deference whatsoever to drum set percussion. This affect reinforces the artificial nature of your surroundings.

The second section of the game takes place in the much older abandoned portion of Aperture laboratories, long since abandoned. Here the instrumentation is still largely electronic, but it reflects a “retro” aesthetic. The primary voice of the old aperture laboratories  is an electronic keyboard resembling a Fender Rhodes. The other electronic sounds tend to be warmer, with a slightly slower attack and less brightness.  The percussion is slightly more organic sounding. The timbral language is basically the same but less extreme, so that the sounds of an acoustic drum set are just barely audible through the distortion and bit-crushing. The effect of all this is not necessarily to make the old Aperture labs feel more organic but rather to age them.

The third section has the player returning to the more modern Aperture, except that the facilities are crumbling even more than before. Without giving away the story, there is a sense of malevolence here. Now the instrumentation is hollow sounding, with a strong bass presence and strong presence in the upper register, but few middle range tones. The pieces make heavy use of low drones, some lacking a rhythmic pulse. The effect is of even greater discomfort than the first section. The player is in much greater danger than before, and these musical changes are a reflection of that.
Spoilers

I discussed earlier that music can be used to reward the player. This is especially true of the ending to Portal 2. Eventually, GlaDos, your sworn enemy, decides to allow you to leave. She tosses you into an elevator. You travel up a few floors, only to have the doors open and be confronted directly by an assortment of the dangerous automated machine gun turrets (with creepily child-like personalities) you spent the game avoiding. The turrets take aim, and just when the player thinks they are in for a tragic ending, the turrets begin to shyly sing in four part harmony. The elevator resumes its journey upward and the song is joined by a multitude of turrets, growing louder and grander like the finale to a romantic opera.
In video games, endings have a different sort of importance than in film. In a game, the ending is not just a conclusion to the story. The ending is what the player has worked hard over many hours in order to get to. Having the most dangerous feature of any level start singing a slightly disjointed robotic aria to you is certainly a bit silly when you describe it, but when you experience it for yourself, it is a very victorious feeling.

Portal 2’s score succeeds in supporting the mood of the game, reacting to the actions of the player, and providing feedback to the player to help them finish the level. It’s loop based composition and use of minimalism make it very flexible, providing for reactivity and feedback while avoiding spending too much memory on music. It does all this without being distracting. The musical loops which are mixed based on proximity to an area or object fade in as the player moves towards them, meaning that there is never the jarring start of a new loop while the player is walking and not effecting the environment. Those loops which do simply start up coincide with some environmental factor which usually triggers a sound effect which hides the beginning of the loop. All of these factors make the music of Portal 2 an intimate part of the player’s experience.
Furthermore, this score’s uniqueness is demonstrable by the fact that Mike Morasky and other programmers at Valve could not use existing software tools to handle the score. They had to write their own custom software for the job.

These movies are hailed (and often parodied) as over-the-top action movies. Yet every shooter game blows these numbers out of the water. Uncharted (which pays homage to Indiana Jones) asks you to kill **hundreds** of enemies in each game, as does every other FPS, because that's how shooter games have *always worked* since the days of DOOM.

Recently there have been some articles about the **conflicted narratives** created by first-person shooters like Tomb Raider and Bioshock Infinite that supposedly explore deep themes but tell them in the standard FPS form.

**[This article](http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2013/04/05/bioshock-infinite-and-the-problem-with-video-game-violence/)** has a link to many other discussions.






I saw a comment in  a review of Bioshock Infinite that defended the game's violence because its purpose is to *show the player* that **""Booker is not a good person; he's a violent man with a violent past.""** 

That seems like a silly rationalization. Infinite's gameplay, with its mid-triple-digit body count, is not an independent artistic choice. It's an acquiescence in the first person shooter's standard format. Booker even gets Master Chief's regenerating shield.

Everything about the game's characters and plot is designed to set up the firefights. That Booker is violent could be called his only *necessary* character trait. Your AI sidekick - a teenage girl - *briefly* voices a token objection to your killing spree before doing a 180 and falling in line (for the rest of the game, she tosses you ammo). All of the nameless NPCs either flee or try to murder you; the prism of violence dominates all interaction between the player and the game.

The clearest example of this is during the [ghost mom](/spoiler) section. [Elizabeth](/spoiler) gets to have a moment of tearful reconciliation; the player gets a boss fight. The game clearly doesn't know what else to do with the player.



One slightly amazing thing about Infinite is that it goes out of its way to keep you from doing anything that isn't FPS. There are puzzles in this game [(the meaning of CAGE, the typewriter Vox puzzle)](/spoiler) but the dialogue solves them for you, as if the game has no confidence you can handle anything but headshots.  There are a handful of encounters where the game drops heavy-handed hints that you're intended to stealth through them. For the other 95% of the game, **the doors are actually *locked* to *make sure* you kill all the enemies before being allowed to progress.**

This makes a nonsense of the story. As one review puts it: *After exploding enough heads, Booker is taken to an alternate reality where the underclass of Columbia has risen up in rebellion. ""These revolutionaries are as bad as their racist oppressors,"" says the deadliest serial killer in the history of human civilization, ""because they are violent.""*

Both games have also gone out of their way to reward exploration, with money or crafting supplies, etc. (The Last of Us may not be the best example as scavenging fits better within the struggle to survive, but almost any game can fit in this topic.)

The result, I feel, is a disconnect between the story's pacing, and the mechanics of the game. Every time I reach a crossroads in a game, I go the opposite way I'm supposed to go in order to explore the map and (hopefully) get better loot. When I make that decision though, I am very aware that I am playing a game. I'm not going left because the character would go left, but because games have taught me that the good stuff is always down the other path. In fact, I would say it goes further than that emotionally. I can't just go down the obvious route because I will be constantly stressing out that I missed something good. In Bioshock Infinite I only used the objective arrow to find out which direction NOT to go.

Now, this may be hard to answer across so many different genres, but does anyone else wish they could enjoy a game without this mindset? Is there something developers can do to remedy this, or is it simply what will always happen if you want to reward exploration in video games?

**EDIT:** This is a really great discussion. Thanks everyone. I have realized that Bioshock Infinite and The Last of Us may not have been the best examples of this happening, and that I used them because they were the last ones where I experienced this. Both games made an effort to address the exploration side of things, but I believe that I, and others, have learned 2 things about games that have formed our mindset:

1. The nice stuff is always hidden, or out of the way.

2. Nothing will ever happen until you get there.

**Edit to add:**

Various news outlets have called it a ""disaster"" and similar.  TechCrunch, for instance, [specifically called out the DRM](http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/09/ea-apologizes-for-simcity-disaster-says-it-was-dumb-and-offers-free-game-to-players/) as the proximate cause of the failure.

Amazon *refused to sell it* for a while due to complaints. When one of your major distributors takes that kind of action, you notice it.

And yes, EA representatives have called it ""a solid hit in major markets"". That's what they'd say even if it wasn't. Spin is their *job*.

&gt;But games will be tied to an Xbox Live account, Wired reveals—or else you'd just be able to pass games around to everyone you know. And if you want to link a game to a second account, you'll have to pay a fee:

&gt;What follows naturally from this is that each disc would have to be tied to a unique Xbox Live account, else you could take a single disc and pass it between everyone you know and copy the game over and over. **Since this is clearly not going to happen, each disc must then only install for a single owner.**

&gt;**Microsoft did say that if a disc was used with a second account, that owner would be given the option to pay a fee and install the game from the disc, which would then mean that the new account would also own the game and could play it without the disc.**

This is complete and total bullshit from a company that just wants to get more money after my initial purchase. More often than not, I lend my games out to my friends after I'm done with them. I borrow games from my friends. We all share PSN accounts to gameshare stuff (and yeah I was pissed as hell too when they moved from 5 PS3s to 2 for gamesharing). Why the fuck do we need to give more money to have the privilege to share our shit?

Yes, I understand that you just need to log in to your account from their box to circumvent this but there's probably going to be a restriction on who log ins to your account at one time.

Frankly, this alone would make me skip the new box completely.

Much, much lower production values, to the point where just about every 2D game can easily be identified as indie. Now that doesn't mean they're necessarily worse, but a lot of times you see hype for indie games equivalent to AAA titles. I went on GameSpot and saw an announcement about an indie game coming to XBLA, as if it were any other game being released by a major publisher. A couple days ago there was an AMA from the dev for Gunpoint, and people were raving about how it was such a great game and they'd be sure to buy a copy to support him.

After watching the gameplay, I can honestly say it seems no different from a flash game from the good ol' golden age of flash games about 10 years ago, when Shockwave was huge, and school kids would go to computer labs to get onto addictinggames. The difference is, one costs typically $10-$20 per copy, and the other was free (for the player). One is reviewed in gaming magazines and websites and the other gets a 1-5 star rating from users. One is constantly hailed on reddit and by gaming communities while the other is thrown aside as being casual.

Look at a game like Limbo. The graphics can be recreated in flash. The length is the same as a lot of flash games (2-3 hours for the memorable ones). It's not a particularly super innovative concept. Sure the art style is nice, but style is independent of budget. And yet Limbo sold millions and was highly praised as being super artistic and worth ever dime. So what is it that makes indie games seem like the new direction of video games, while flash games have been tossed aside as cheap casual entertainment to pass the time here and there and never taken seriously?

1339066034.0,830,self.truegaming,uplbe,Permadeath in Fallout 3 is gripping as hell,karthink,1107,277,328,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/uplbe/permadeath_in_fallout_3_is_gripping_as_hell/,"Death in RPGs is meaningless, isn't it? I mean, it's okay if you're screwing around with the game mechanics and builds for maximum ""emergence"" or effectiveness, like in Just Cause 2 or ARPGs respectively, but as a vault-sheltered character with realistic motivations in a fictional world, why aren't I scared of dying in the wastes? The way FO3 is set up, death is a nuisance in a post-apocalyptic game that's about the *survival of the human race*.

The tone of Fallout 3 didn't work for me at all. So, inspired by the [Far Cry 2 permadeath](http://drgamelove.blogspot.in/2009/12/permanent-death-complete-saga.html) write-ups from a few years before, the recent DayZ phenomenon and several other explorations of this topic, I decided to play FO3 like a true wasteland survivor and pack rat would. If I die, I die; I stop playing and uninstall the game.

By itself, the capital wasteland is not a harsh place (the way The Zone is in Stalker), so I installed a few mods (details below). Firearms are more potent and varied, there are more drugs with specific drawbacks, skill progression is slower to encourage specialization, perks are better and more diverse, hunger, thirst and sleep deprivation are issues now... and the wasteland is a harsher, less forgiving, *more* interesting and dynamic place. The nights are pitch black, and there are several more kinds of mutants and fauna around so you never know what you will find out there.

The most important addition is a sprint button, letting me burn Action Points in exchange for a quick egress from combat. The other tactical choice is bullet time, which gives me a slight edge in combat but consumes APs *and* requires a steady supply of a psychotropic drug (Jet). Finally, VATS runs in realtime and you take full damage (it was 25% or so in vanilla FO3) , and is really useful to ""tag"" multiple enemies when swamped. The game is hard now, but if you're in trouble, it's because you got cocky and overreached.

This means making safe choices. This means fending off a radscorpion at my level is harrowing, and having a supermutant chase you is atavistically terrifying. This means raider packs are a real threat, and I *cannot* afford to get flanked. It means a crippled leg while outnumbered in a firefight is certain death. I feel exposed and vulnerable when walking through the wasteland. Ambushes are carefully planned, multiple interior paths are rigged with mines, every bullet is a precious resource and headshots are godsends. This means a button to lean around corners is sorely missed.

Most importantly, my outlook of the wasteland has changed. I don't look at it as an activity sandbox, and quests as an XP source--it's a real place, and I make choices driven by survival, such as refusing to do a quest that involves wading into a minefield ghost town or protecting a settlement against a supermutant onslaught. It's a strange thing: the satisfaction of clearing out a raider infested location pales when compared to the relief from skirting around it. (Sometimes I lob a grenade or two in and hightail it out of there. That's even better.)

The problem, you might say, is that ""progress"" is slow and plodding. But what is progress exactly? The game is no longer a checklist of locations to unlock/discover on the map, quests to do or XP to earn. The metric of progress here has shifted to how many nights I've survived, how much easier the next day will be (I sleep at night because the nights are now dark, scary and difficult to prepare for), and even how long it will be before I can brave the journey to Galaxy News Radio to find my dad. The main quest and all the little stories, bad writing or not, have an impact now that was lacking before. Moira saying ""Be careful out there"" is not an empty platitude to click through anymore.

It's nigh impossible to be an altruist or charitable person now, and the silly karma meter takes on a whole new dimension. It's fantastic, because I experience all the tension of a survival game, but with the richness of Bethesda's world-building. There's no going back. I stand to lose a great deal by not being careful, and am significantly invested in my character now--a first for an open-world game. Permadeath has given my Fallout 3 experience something Bethesda did not: Meaning.

I highly recommend it.

**TL;DR**: Permadeath FO3 playthrough is intense, scary, fun, sometimes exhilarating because it gives you *something to lose*. Get some mods, then try it.

Most games give some sense of accomplishment, a feeling that you're making progress towards eventually saving the world or something. But here, the best you can do is evacuate civilians, blow up 1 Covenant cruiser before an entire armada arrives, or destroy enemy communications systems temporarily before they pick off your squad. 

Even though this could be seen as frustrating to some, I thought this was a unique perspective to the genre. In war, sometimes you just don't win. You get blindsided and have to face the fact that you are losing. The reason Bungie can get away with this sort of narrative is because its a prequel, and people know how the story turns out. If this was the beginning of a new franchise, it would have killed any hope people had for the future.  

Adding on to the unique perspective of the game, you don't play the universe saving Master Chief. You're simply Noble Six, a replacement for your fallen predecessor. Bungie had done this previously with Halo: ODST, with you controlling a character looking for his squad mates in a fallen city. Again, I have to give them credit for playing around with different perspectives in the Human-Covenant War. This increases the feeling that this thing is actually a team effort, and there are a lot of small heroes that you don't hear about as much. Noble Six sacrifices himself for the bigger picture at the end of the game, holding off the Covenant so that the Chief can be taken away with Cortana. I liked how it reinforced the idea that you aren't the ""Chosen One"", despite being told that Cortana specifically picked you to carry her to the dropship (which made me feel like a really skilled delivery boy). 

I wish more games, especially in big franchises would do different things like this. The FPS genre has gotten quite stale, and even though things like Spec Ops: The Line pop up occasionally, there needs to be more variety.

Don't get me wrong, the Nazi regime was the closest thing to a supervillain the world has ever seen, and I absolutely do not sympathize or condone any actions taken by the Reich. I would never suggest a game about how the Nazis were in the right.

Company of Heroes is the closest I've found to showing this perspective on the war, with a handful of scenes showing ordinary, daily conversations of the German troops (""Your coffee tastes like piss!""

We had been dating for a number of years prior to that, so my wife already knew that I identified as a ""gamer,"" although she herself was not one at all.

Lately she's been curious about it, so I decided to start her out on a little 'educational' foray into gaming. I think I've only played maybe one or two games with her in the entire time I've known her (WOW and Mario Party, both times were very short and we never repeated the session afterwards). I figured I'd pick something accessible, controlled by mouse only in order to ease her into it. I picked World of Goo, since I figured simple physics puzzles are easier to get into -- in my mind anyway -- than shooting random dudes. But about five to ten minutes in, she kinda got visibly angry/frustrated when she got stuck on something that I myself had been stuck on for quite a bit when I played it last year. I tried to reassure her by saying it was *okay* to be stuck and she could have fun figuring it out to get that aha! moment of satisfaction at surpassing the challenge, but it turns out she was more of the mind that frustration was NOT fun at all, and why would she subject herself to that? She made the comparison that if she gets frustrated at something in the real world and fixes it, like a challenge at her workplace, she feels satisfied because she accomplished something, but games frustrating her is basically futile and pointless exercise.

I think now I know to not have her play a puzzle game again, but I had a hard time explaining to her the ""appeal"" of games because I realized that she is pretty much correct - many, if not all, games ARE structured exercises in having your agency frustrated and then feeling that sense of achievement in overcoming it. Even more story-based games like adventure games have frustrating puzzles as a mechanic.

Sorry for the semi-long and philosophic post, but I figured this would be a good place to ask: how *would* you explain this to someone who feels the way my wife does? Why play games at all if you're someone that doesn't enjoy frustration? Obviously there are some people who get REALLY angry and fling the controller at their TV, but they get back onto the saddle anyway, so there's something there.

Ignoring the difficulties to log in as this is more based around the game itself. Diablo 3 had an awful launch but people were soon over the log-in problems and on to Diablo's greater flaws. Does SimCity have these greater flaws?

As a city building simulator how is it?

Does it compare to earlier titles? Sure it's missing some features from the earlier ones but that doesn't automatically make it bad (as /r/gaming seems to think). Are the smaller city plots really that bad? A giant map isn't always better, I don't ever remember filling out a whole map in earlier SimCitys.

As a gaming enthusiast/programmer I am very interested in the A.I system they've used for this game. Is it like they said in earlier videos about everything being simulated properly, rather than ""There is traffic, draw some traffic""? Does every person exist and interact with the world. Is it the same with materials/products?

How is the online play? Are the online features interesting and enjoyable or just a hinderance? Online only DRM doesn't really phase me. I'm always connected to the internet and some online only games offer some pretty interesting features. Take Anno 2070 for example, personally I really like the on-line features for that. You have a giant 'Arc' that's like a mobile sea-station, it can carry upgrades and materials to your new areas to give you boosts/head starts. It allows you to have a global goal across multiple islands.

I personally haven't had a chance to play it as it does not release in the UK till Friday. I am interested though but I'm finding it hard to get some real opinions on the game. All I can find is ""EA sucks"", ""Only online sucks!"", ""The log in doesn't even work!"", ""Omg small land plots!"", etc... It also doesn't help that some people who are playing it, are even taking screenshots and giving out false information. Such as the roundabouts screenshot on the front page or /r/gaming right now.

1366732716.0,636,self.truegaming,1cxx9z,Punching bag enemies: one of the biggest flaws of today's games,bleakzero,844,208,364,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1cxx9z/punching_bag_enemies_one_of_the_biggest_flaws_of/,"Recently, I've been starting to suffer from some sort of “gaming depression”, where I would grow tired of or turn out uninterested by most of the games that have been coming out in the recent years. Initially, I thought I was simply growing older and therefore losing interest in the hobby that I've had since I was a kid (it can happen)... but then I began to really think about it. I tried figuring out what made me gradually lose interest in games in general. I thought about all the games that I've enjoyed in the past, about what my favorite game series are (Zelda, Castlevania, The Elder Scrolls, Diablo) and then I tried comparing them to other games that I've played recently. I also attempted to find what made generally well-received games by the public somewhat boring to me (at least after a few hours of gameplay).

Now, all games have their flaws. Sometimes a game will have game balancing and difficulty scaling problems. Others will have story pacing issues or lack some originality in the enemy designs. Some games are, simply put, broken. But after putting some thoughts on it, I found out that there is one thing that keeps coming back in today's games that always ends up rendering the gameplay pretty dull: punching bag enemies (as you could guess from the title :P)

I'm unsure as to when they started getting popular... but enemies in most recent games simply do not react to player damage and can generally be defeated with a constant stream of attacks. I'm not necessarily talking about AI issues here – the problem is that regular enemies can always be defeated simply by attacking them up-front.

Let's look at the Zelda series, at the game “Zelda: A Link To The Past” in particular (since it is one of my favorite games) to see what this game does right. Most of the enemies found in this game have special attributes and defensive abilities that makes it hard (and sometimes impossible) to kill them simply by wailing at them. Most [Hyrule Guards](http://zelda.wikia.com/wiki/Hyrule_Guard) carry a shield and sword which block Link's sword and bow attacks from the front, forcing the player to move around them or to bait them into charging him so as to attack them from the sides or back. [Hardhat Beetles](http://zelda.wikia.com/wiki/Hardhat_Beetle) are impervious to most attacks, bouncing backwards when they are attacked, forcing the player to kill them by pushing them down holes. [Stalfos](http://zelda.wikia.com/wiki/Stalfos) are fairly simple but jump backwards as soon as the player swings a sword near them, forcing him to stand very close to them to deal damage. These are only examples of enemies found in this game but in all cases enemies blink and fly backwards whenever they take damage. In short, **they react to the player's attacks**.

Now, if you look at most action RPGs out there, enemies do not react this way. No matter how often you strike at them, they take all the damage without flinching until their HP drops to 0. Therefore, because of how simple it is to defeat these punching bag enemies, the difficulty of these games is entirely dependent on the statistics and gear of the main character(s). Some of the simpler games also lack any sort of strategy, requiring only to stand in front of a mob of enemies, chugging potions whenever health drops low.

This issue can also be seen in a lot of FPS/third person shooters – some enemies do carry shields or have increased resistance to damage, but most of them can take a lot of bullets to the face and will never react to the “hypothetical” pain they should feel from receiving 50 machine gun bullets in a short time frame.

This problem, at least to me, ruins some of the enjoyment that I could get from a game especially after  going through the part of the game where everything is still “fresh and new”. Once I get comfortable with the controls and then focus on a strategy (the regular rifle/shotgun/magnum combo in FPS, or after starting a specific character build in RPGs), all encounters (aside from boss battles) are taken care of the exact same way – head-on, all guns blazing to the enemy's face. I can often dodge their attacks... but the enemies usually can't (or don't want to!)

I think it's a shame, really. Developers needs to put more thoughts on the enemies because after a while, the game starts lacking any kind of challenge, meaning you have no need to use other strategies. Even if you find out how to defeat a specific enemy, putting them in different situations and pairing them with other enemies can really make fights far more intense. If you add an enemy that can block damage from the front, that's great... but what if they then spawn right next to you, in an area with barely any cover? Are you going to shoot their faces off like usual, or are you finally going to use those mines that you never had the need to use before? What about pushing them down from a platform?

http://theparanoidgamer.com/why-gamer-entitlement-is-a-bullshit-buzzword/

A new word has been popping up a lot lately in the crazy world of gaming media. It’s a word used to devalue the complaints, movements, petitions and consumer rights of gamers everywhere. That word, in all of its insulting glory, is “Entitlement”.

You see this word thrown around constantly by all variety of gaming sites, and its become especially common over the last few weeks as various media outlets attempt to report on the recent controversies involving Bioware and Mass Effect 3. Frankly, I’m less interested in outlining the myriad of issues in Mass Effect 3 than I am in pointing a finger at the countless gaming websites, publishers and developers that have insulted and mistreated so many of us with sickening smugness.

Take for example this video by IGN’s Colin Moriarty. This is a man who can get on camera and say that he wouldn’t see anything wrong with ME3 being 90% on disc DLC, all while dramatically steepling his fingers and laying down the law of reality on what he clearly sees as nothing more than a gaggle of impotent nerds. It’s a growing sentiment amongst the gaming media, and it’s shocking that anyone who actually contributes to a professional gaming website can be such a massive douchebag to so many people while keeping a relatively straight face.

I’m sick and tired of seeing this buzzword spread from one corner of the web to another, spouted by people who haven’t had any proper sense of perspective in years. It’s for this reason that I will now thoroughly and utterly crush the concept of gamer entitlement into the ground.

First of all, what is entitlement? Originally it had more to do with the concept of rights and how you, as a citizen or human being, were entitled to be treated by law. In modern times, entitlement has taken on a different meaning and is now interchangeable with spoiled. Essentially, someone who believes that they should be treated better than others, despite the fact that they are undeserving of this treatment or have done nothing to earn it. However, I don’t believe that this concept applies to consumers.

Imagine that you’ve gone to a restaurant for a nice steak. Once you’re seated your waiter doesn’t bother to bring you a menu until you flag him down and is generally rude and impatient with you. He brings you a drink that’s different from what you ordered and doesn’t even bother to refill your drink a single time. When you finally get your steak it’s cooked twice as long as you wanted and has a nice thick hair on it that’s not yours. In the eyes of the gaming media, if you complained to management, gave the waiter a bad tip (or no tip at all), wrote a bad review about the restaurant on a local attractions website and then never ate there again, you would be an overly entitled eater. Which is, of course, wrong.

The above argument perfectly illustrates my point in that there is a clear difference between being a spoiled brat and simply being entitled to a decent treatment from the goods you’ve paid for.

Consumers don’t buy rotten food from grocery stores. They don’t like using services that screw them out of their money or don’t do what they’re advertised to do. They don’t keep broken electronics and other goods. If you buy a $60 appliance and it doesn’t work, you can take it back to the store for a full refund. If you buy a $60 game, open it, play it and find that it doesn’t meet your expectations, you’re often shit out of luck unless you want to resell it for a massive loss (something you can’t even do if you purchased digitally). 

Wherein then is the gamer’s recourse? Message boards, Twitter, Youtube, Metacritic and countless other communities are often the only place that these people can go to give voice to their issues. Sometimes this happens in destructive and controversial ways, with threats of boycotts, public flaming of developers on Twitter, and occasionally even hacking. All of this is usually quite dramatic and exactly the sort of thing that the gaming media loves to report on, but they tend to criticize and paint the fans as rabid basement warriors, rather than trying to understand how a group of rational people could feel so out of options that their passion drives them to such actions in the first place. It’s no wonder that these controversies pop up left and right given that the gaming industry has a tendency to treat its fans in an adversarial manner quite unlike that of any other entertainment medium.

In a netscape where developers openly call people “Fucking Morons” on Twitter and casually delete complaints off official forums, why shouldn’t angry consumers bomb Amazon and Metacritic reviews? Why shouldn’t they create petitions and flood message boards with their anger? What else can they do? Besides, numerous are the petitions, lawsuits and fan movements that have brought about real changes in the way developers and publishers do business and treat their customers.

I suppose that when you get right down to it, what really bothers me is that when we work and live in a world already rife with so much trouble and hardship, why is it that we have to play in a gaming landscape such as this? An environment where developers have all but cut support for split-screen and LAN play out of their feature list. Where game content is cut into pieces and sold to different companies to entice you into buying from one retailer or another. Where PC gaming is treated to terrible port after terrible port, some so shoddily done by major studios that they prompt you to hit the “Start” button on the menu screen. Where Microsoft can charge millions of gamers for peer to peer online and nobody cares. A land where it’s okay to lock away content on the disc that you’ve bought so that they can sell it back to you. Where mod tools are barely an afterthought. Where it’s policy to tack a multiplayer component onto a single-player game just so that they can charge you for an online pass. A place where it’s perfectly fine to release buggy, broken games and then rely on patches to fix them months later, or even more commonly, not at all. Where beloved franchises are gutted and turned into generic first-person shooter properties. Where the reviews are done by websites whose paychecks come from the company whose product they are reviewing. Where intrusive DRM punishes the consumer far more than the pirate. Where you can get in-game advantages in multiplayer focused titles by buying Mountain Dew.

That sad, barren gaming landscape isn’t one that I would ever want to call home, yet here we are. The next time you see a website calling you entitled just for wanting better for yourself and the games you love, call them out on it. Stand up for yourself, because none of these media outlets really care about your best interests and they never will. What they do care about is exclusive preview content, early review copies and ad revenue. For that reason the vast majority of these sites will always be on the side of the corporations and not the consumers.

Entitlement? I think we’re all entitled to our own opinion and the right to express it however we like; for good or bad.

May not seem like a big deal now but seeing your favorite AAA franchises stunted creatively with poor game mechanics in the future is very real - unless of course, you pay the piper.

When companies begin monetizing their narratively driven, single-player game, they're starting the vicious cycle of compromising their creative integrity, no matter how you slice it. If this model is a success, publishers like EA are going to push the envelope even further.

Core gameplay mechanics are being exploited to make a quick buck. Do gamers everywhere a favor, don't support this kind of BS in video games.

Spread the word.

EDIT: Just to make it clear, I'm not concerned about extra DLCs that tack on new weapons or credits. Those are fine as they are external to the core gameplay and it is clear that the player is the one who makes the decision to opt-in.

But when a company releases a DLC that tweaks a fundamental game mechanic, I start to worry. For all we know the scavenger robot's cooldown was originally 5 minutes, not 10. How much of the game was scraped and altered just to make a quick buck? I worry about the type of decisions that are being made during the design process. The ones that are not in the player's interest. The question is no longer about maximizing player enjoyment but instead shifts to: How much of our vision are we willing to compromise to maximize dollars?

It's a slippery slope. That's all I'm saying.

First of all, every company exists to make a profit.  Even Nintendo and Valve you guys.  Every company needs to make more money, and, when faced with a decision between making a little money and a lot of money, they will go with making a lot of money.  *This is normal and every business does this.  It does not make these guys any more evil.*

Yes, indie developers, like indie bands or movie producers, make the artistic statement they want at a loss of profit or even capital, but once a company is formed that has shareholders, or quarterly goals they need to hit, the profits are what takes over.

Sometimes companies do things that don't appear like they're making a profit, but it's all carefully planned.  Valve doesn't made 90% off sales because Gabe is an angel, it's because he makes more money during them.  Any really serious talk you see Gabe in will show that underneath, he is a smart and calculated businessman and capitalist.  

Call me a cynic or pessimist, but the reason that companies make good games and inspiring developer interviews and celebrate 25th anniversaries, is because that nostalgic or magical feeling...translates to cold hard cash.  A good game will sell well and make them money, and if good enough, users will buy the next game in the series even if it's shitty.  That's a good place to be.

Imagine if in your 401k or retirement account, you have a vested interest in, say, the distributing company behind Twilight (I'm trying to pick an example I think none of you will care about).  Your money is being invested in a company that makes Twilight action figures.  The company can rush one out for a 50% profit, or spend extra time making it artistically accurate and perfect for the niche action figure market, but at a 20% profit.  As someone who doesn't care about that artistic market, you obviously want the company to rush it out to make you more money.

This example can be repeated with basket weaving or the Disney channel, or whatever.  When the big men in suits start running the company, they want to make a profit.  And yes, there will be those indie guys who come out of a response to this.  But it's silly to comment at things like ""Ubisoft should do this this and this"" when those choices would clearly lose them profit.

Why do CoD and Asassins Creeds keep getting made every year?  Profit.  And you shouldn't bitch in the comments about how Activision or Ubisoft should change that.  They want to make money and they're doing it beautifully.  Changing their focus to please /r/games and /r/truegaming to lose money would be economic suicide.

And on a side note, it is truly amusing to see comments from armchair economists who say things like ""Microsoft is leaving a bunch of money on the table by ignoring emerging markets without internet in Africa and South America"", as if an 18 year old on a message board has more business experience than a Regional Director with a whole team of people doing research and crunching numbers.

Overall, I would love to see people to stop asking companies to to economically crazy things.  If our world/national economic system is truly that appalling to you, I urge you to research other economic systems in which your ideas may have a better chance of happening (Social Democracy, Socialism, Resource based societies, etc...) and politically campaign to work towards those types of societies.  Then maybe it will be possible to have 200 guys work for 3 years on a game with your precise artistic merit.

EDIT:  Some people are misunderstanding what I'm saying.  I'm no shill, or hardcore Republican.  I'm as anti everything as you are.  I'm just trying to redirect your anger.

I love retro gaming, but I'm not a big fan of pirating media (though I have no personal issue with those who do). I also loving gaming on the go, so it seems like it would benefit people like me and companies like Nintendo if they did this. Right now I only download ROMs for games that I already own, which makes me feel a little bit justified in my pirating, but I want to play hard to find games like Secret of Mana without having to spend a fortune on buying the the actual game so I can download ROMs with less guilt.

I know you can buy some retro games legally through other means, but it just seems to make sense to me that they would have a service that would work with most all popular devices. I would happily pay $5-$15 for official NES, SNES, Gameboy, Genesis, etc games that I can play on my smartphone. Why don't they want my money? It seems so easy! They probably aren't making much money off those old consoles anymore anyway.

**EDIT:**
I just want to add this,

Do you guys really believe if they allowed legal means to download retro games outside of the Virtual Console that it would really affect hardware sales that much? I believe as long as they release new and popular titles on current hardware that they would still continue to sell units. If legal services were available to play NES/SNES games outside of VC, would that really affect your decision to buy something like a 3DS? Millions are already emulating illegally, it's just Nintendo sees no money from this.

Furthermore, services like Virtual Console are extremely limited. If I want to play a game like Secret of Mana, I have two options. 1.) I can play it illegally through emulation, or 2.) I can buy the game used (which is pretty expensive). In both cases Nintendo sees no cash from me. I actually WANT to give Nintendo my money! I don't have any desire to purchase a 3DS right now, and besides, Secret of Mana isn't even available through VC. VC is way too limited for me to want to buy a 3DS or similar device to play retro games. 

**EDIT 2:**

Alright, you guys have brought up many good points and have convinced me that it's probably a poor business decision on Nintendo's part.

Shadow of Chernobyl is the absolute best Open-world Survival Horror FPS game.,Enleat,730,185,234,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1iknek/why_i_think_stalker_shadow_of_chernobyl_is_the/,"Ever since i first played S.T.A.L.K.E.R., i was taken aback by it and it left a lasting impact on how i think Open world games like *Fallout* and other games *should* be made and why.

I think that the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series is simply fantastic because of it's unrelenting *brutality*, and it's focus on pure terrifying and subtle atmosphere that does not rely on jump scares, and because of the way it handled skill and the ""Karma"" and Level Up"" system.... or, to put it bluntly, the brilliant *lack* of them.

First of **the brutality:**

I made this comment on this subreddit a few months ago. [Link.](http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/15gto8/have_you_ever_experienced_a_moment_of_pure_dread/c7mcndy)

&gt; The games atmosphere, ambience, creatures and sound effects lead me to be afraid of stepping one foot out of any safe zone and into the untamed wilds of The Zone.

&gt; Seriously, going through The Zone isn't a cakewalk. It's not like in Fallout 3 or New Vegas when you can walk around the Wasteland and only come across one or two enemies. 

&gt; Once you step outside of *any* safezone, you are beset upon by the dangers of The Zone, and staying alive depends completely on how prepared you are.

&gt; That game really made me dread kicking up my feet and walking outside into the wild, when i just know that *everything* is out there to kill me. Bandits, enemy factions, anomalies, creatures, you just aren't safe.

&gt; I basicaly ran all he way from one safe zone to the next because there isn't any rest to be had once you're out in the open. You're constantly fighting to remain in one piece, and it truly add's to the feel of the game.

Through out the entire game, the feeling that surrounds you, penetrates you, makes you uneasy and lulls you into a sort of somber trance, is the simple fear that *everything outside can and will kill you.*

In many open world games, survival isn't that big of a deal as long as you leveled up and it stops being fun.

In The Zone however, you live and travel with the knowledge that your trek through the zone will be constant running from beasts, enemies and avoiding anomalies, and the only respite that you will ever see is by getting to a checkpoint with other Stalkers in the zone.

You *fear* kicking up your feet and going into The Zone, because, like i said, everything can kill you and you are never safe out in the open.

When i played it, my entire path from the first part of the game, The Cordon, to the 100 Rads Bar was nothing but constant running, gunning, healing and nothing but fear and the feeling that i had no chance. 

As soon as you leave The Cordon, which is relativley safe when compared to the rest of the game, there is no screwing around.

One of the major reasons for this is **the atmosphere:**

The Zone is at once, a somber, kind of meditative place and a wild, untamed, terrifying wilderness. Gunshots are common and omnypresent. Helicopters often fly over, breaking the silence, but worst of all are the faint and distant roars of.... *who knows what they are.* 

But The Zone has a sort of eeire quality to it that many times, it leaves you feeling very *alone*, somber, even a little depressed, and the subtle emotion upon the end of the game completes this feeling. It's a beautiful mix of loneliness and fear.

But what sets S.T.A.L.K.E.R. apart from other games is that **it lacks a level up system**:

In S.T.A.L.K.E.R; **you don't have any character attributes, or perks, or any sort of level up system that will help you survive.**

Instead, **you are completely left alone to fend for yourself** and your survival depends COMPLETELY on how well prepared you are. There is no level up system to save you when your gun jams and you're being chased by a Bloodsucker in a deep, dark tunnel.

Your survival depends completely on: how much ammo you have, the quality of your weapons and ammo, your weapon handling, how many weapons you have, but above all **your own skill at aiming the damn thing.**

In this way, the game never get's boring because you know that any minor slip up or disatser will lead to you being massacred and you are never lulled into a sense of security. As i said, these things force you to keep on your toes.

Along with atmosphere and the pure brutality of the gameplay and survival, the games rise up above other, modern open world FPS'. 

Fallout may be fun, and the level up system and perk system is neat and fun, but it's *nothing* compared to The Zone. There is no pussyfooting. Make it out on your own, there are no perks for accuracy.

Figure it out yourself. Shoot straight and don't miss.

But what i really like is **the lack of any karma system in it's modern form.**

Karma systems in modern gaming are broken and unrealistic, as well as being mostly incosistent.

In S.T.A.L.K.E.R; it's simplified to the point where it's just sort of an add on, and not a massive part of the game.

It isn't really a karma system, as it doesn't ensure you any sort of ebenfits from the people you help... you're just kind of a, well, friend, after helping them. But that doesn't give you really any sort of perk as opposed to being evil. It's all the same.

However if you screw up and attack a faction, like The Loners for example, they will turn on you in a heartbeat for killing one of their own. Helping grannies walk across the street won't help that.

IMO, many modern games should stop holding the players hand and dump him in a place where he will be forced to think and survive, with no perks or any sort of level up system. 

The karma system should be scrapped and replaced with something much more, well, *cruel*, if i can put it that way.

So yeah, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is great and weneed more games like it. The only other game that comes to mind is the Metro: 2033 series, but it's not near S.T.A.L.K.E.R...

I even have to lump myself into this category. As of right now, I own 334 STEAM titles, and I've only played about 35 percent of them, yet I keep buying games. Am I realistically ever going to play all of these titles, and more to the point, why AM I so concerned with picking up more games if I can't even handle my library in the first place.

I mean all we needed was to find a keygen and we were off to the races. I remember thinking then that something about this was just too easy, but being young I sort of justified it and went on with my day. I didn't pirate to ""try"" a game, I pirated games to play them and then when I was bored, I moved onto something else.  

We're at the point now where more and more games will require always on DRM, or in the very least a distribution service like STEAM which is non intrusive but still a way of making sure you paid for a product legally. 

I guess.. I'm not really surprised at all. I knew that I wasn't the only one of my peers pirating games, and I also knew that very few of us actually paid for a title. 

Maybe its a bit of guilt but when I see an uproar like the one we're witnessing now over SimCity's DRM or what happened with Diablo 3, I only have to shrug and wonder if we (We as in PC gamers) did this to ourselves. I sometimes wonder just how many of those complaining are doing so only because they are frustrated that they can't pirate the game for free. I know that's cynical to think, and maybe I'm just a really patient gamer, but I look at wait times for servers and I just find something else to do in the meantime instead of wanting to rage about it. 

I mean, to anyone else my age (or around it), how long did you think that we'd have it as easy as we did to pirate software? Did you not think there would be repercussions going forward? Developers want money for their product, and, as someone who is inching forward to having a family, I honestly cannot say I blame them.

This can be a more conventional gaming site – one of mine is GiantBomb.com – or less typical sources, such as Yahtzee or the Penny Arcade guys, who don’t publish formal reviews but who do talk about specific game and whose opinions I generally trust, even if I don’t follow them that closely anymore. Yahtzee’s another matter: though he often receives flak for not being a ‘legitimate’ critics, I find his reviews more honest than almost any others out there, and he often takes his criticism to a level few others will touch, [actually criticizing the story of Black Ops 2 and discussing its implications]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhHFx5UL0xc), for instance. If most reviews fall into two categories, blank press releases and consideration of gameplay (ie is it fun? interesting?), Yahtzee seems to occupy another space, in which, at least in some reviews, he engages in a critical analysis where he questions a game’s message and implications. Of course I’m not interested in the first category of reviewer, but good examples of the second (serious gameplay evaluation) and third (critical analysis) are both very welcome.

So who are your trusted critics? What people and sites am I missing, including critics that don’t explicitly publish reviews? Though I’m interested in gameplay critics, I’m especially interested in anyone who does any kind of critical analysis, since it seems pretty rare in gaming criticism right now.

1359329636.0,499,self.truegaming,17e7uu,"How do you distinguish good difficulty from bad or ""fake"" difficulty?",Khiva,612,113,363,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/17e7uu/how_do_you_distinguish_good_difficulty_from_bad/,"I've been turning this question around in my head a bit, and what follows is the best I've been able to come up with as far as principles that seem to distinguish good design from bad.  I'll primarily use Dark Souls as an example, since that's what comes up a lot.

**PRINCIPLE 1**

* Clear rules.  You understand why you failed, and what you need to do in order to progress.

This is probably the biggest one, and the biggest reason why Dark Souls is widely considered ""punishingly difficult and yet somehow fair.""  It's very rare in Dark Souls that you die for reasons that mystify you - in the typical instance, you failed to parry, or dodge, or you fell off a ledge.  You know what went wrong, and you know what you need to do in order to fix it.

It's telling, then, that the most hated boss in Dark Souls is not the one generally considered to be the most difficult (Orstein and Smough) but rather the Bed of Chaos, which is considered the most ""unfair.""  The problem with the Bed of Chaos fight is not that you die a lot while attacking it (surely you die more at other bosses), but that the deaths you incur strain the sense of reasonableness that the game has worked so hard to inculcate.  The claws which send you to your doom just seem to come out of nowhere, without the degree of warning or pattern that you expect from most boss fights.  At least in my experience, I could watch a boss long enough and figure out the pattern and therefore plot out a course to victory.  The Bed of Chaos may have a pattern of some sort, but I could never really quite figure it out and therefore had to rely on luck to a much larger extent than in the rest of the game.  The rules weren't communicated particularly well, and that is what appears to distinguish the fight from more challenging ones, like O &amp; S.

As a subpoint to this principle, I would also include:

* _Bad difficulty derives from gummy or imprecise controls_.

This is a common complaint, and to me it seems to fall into the same bucket of failing to understand why you failed or what you need to do to correct it.  Super Meat Boy is often touted as another example of a ""hard"" game done right, and indeed in nearly every instance where I died I couple glimpse the split second where I hadn't quite nailed the timing right.  Bed of Chaos also encompasses this to a certain degree, as the jump/roll that is required can be rather tricky since Dark Souls, for all the things it does well, didn't do precision rolling/jumping particularly well.

**PRINCIPLE 2**

* The challenge comes primarily from _applying_ the rules you've learned, rather than figuring out the rules themselves.

This is actually an area where I think you can legitimately fault Dark Souls.  In a game which gets difficulty right in so many respects, I don't quite see how it adds to the enjoyment of the title to make core game mechanics like stats and covenants so impenetrable.  What exactly is fun about finding out midway through your game that Resistance is a useless stat?  Is it fair for a game like Dark Souls or Terraria to all but expect players to search online for how certain aspects of the game operate?

Probably the most frustrating aspect of any game is dying over and over again and _not understanding why_.  The challenge of the game designer is, then, presenting an obstacle while also giving the player a reasonable opportunity, based on the logic of the universe presented, to solve it.

As a subpoint to this principle, I'd add:

* _Bad difficulty derives from the game designer expecting the player to apply the rules in an unclear or unintuitive way, such that the player isn't given a fair chance of success._

Your classic example here is Simon's Quest, back on the NES.  Townsfolk who are supposed to give you clues actually lie to you, and at one point in order to progress you have to equip a random crystal and go duck in some random place.  I have no idea how on earth anyone ever figured that out on their own.  How could you have known that this crystal had that mechanical function in those conditions?  (Side note - does anyone else kind of get a Simon's Quest vibe from Dark Souls?)

**PRINCIPLE 3**

* Good difficulty primarily derives from the depth of the challenge, rather than volume of it.

I might be going out on a limb here, but I've long though that one of the cheapest ways to design a boss battle is to have one big guy surrounded by dozen of mooks you have to juggle at the same time.  Why?  Because fending off waves means that the designer did not have to come up with a deeper tactical challenge for the boss.  Again, note that the bosses in Dark Souls never stoop to this level - each one presents a novel and complex set of moves and patterns that must be discerned in order to defeat them.  You couldn't fight, say, the Iron Golem if he was surrounded by dozens of hollows - they'd have to scale down the complexity of his attacks to compensate.  You'd end up with a cheaper, more frenetic fight that would leave you distracted half the time.

Note, of course, that this does not apply to certain genres like Bullet Hell shooters, where a mass of mooks is to be expected.  I'm thinking more of how fighting the dragons in Dragon Age was much more satisfying than the final battle, which stooped to the ""wave of distracting mooks"" approach.  See also:  Legend of Grimrock.

To take a slightly different example, I would include ""suddenly janking the camera angles"" as an instance of shallow and therefore ""bad"" difficulty.  Fortunately you don't see this is games so much anymore, but memorizing where the cameras are going to change in Devil May Cry doesn't involve mastering the moves or learning an enemies pattern - it's just memorizing an arbitrary obstacle that only exists for one room, and isn't repeated.  It's the shallowness of it that galls. 

As a subpoint to this principle, I'd also include: 

* _""Bad difficulty requires the player to repeat lengthy and tedious stretches of gameplay to return to the challenge.""_  

Again, this doesn't add to the depth of the challenge, it merely adds to the volume of it.  Dark Souls is an interesting example of this in that it straddled the line a bit.  Most times when you were forced to repeat sections the challenge remained fresh because the enemies were complicated and deadly, plus the accumulation of souls added to the sense of advancement.  I'm not convinced, however, that lengthy runs to some of the boss fights were necessary.  The bonfire run to O&amp;S seemed about right, the run to Bed of Chaos just got old.

I'm sort of spitballing a bit with this topic here, but I haven't really found a place where the concept of difficulty was addressed in a nice, systematic way elsewhere.  It's a tricky subject too, because people really draw the line in different places (I'm sure there are people who love Dark Souls in even at its most obtuse).  So what have I missed here?

Have you ever had a friend with whom you shared a hatred of something popular?  Maybe everyone was really into Skub, and you both thought Skub was really lame.  It's what drew you together, what sets your friend apart from all the other people who mindlessly follow whatever's popular.

Then, one day, your friend starts talking about how they've been getting into Skub recently.  Or maybe you're with a group of people talking about Skub, and your friend doesn't seem to hate it quite as much as they did when you were alone.

Feels like a betrayal, doesn't it?  Who is this person?  Were they lying when you were alone?  What happened to the person who was by your side in rejecting fads and trends?

Your friend wasn't necessarily a traitor.  They just felt the pressure of doing or saying something because it was expected of them - when you hated Skub, they felt compelled to hate it, because you were friends and they didn't want you to dislike them.  When others liked Skub, they felt compelled to like it, because they didn't want to seem like an asshole.  

That's a pressure that each and every one of us is subject to.  The kid downloading the latest Nicki Minaj single because all their friends are into it.  The guy who's never actually played Madden or spent time learning its mechanics to see the appeal but happily joins in the condemnation of it.  We might like to think of ourselves as lone voices of reason in a crazy world, but we're really only that way in our heads - on the outside, most of us seem to go along with things depending on our environment.  Like Rachel Dawes said, ""it's not who you are underneath, but what you do that defines you.""

So what's all this got to do with /r/truegaming?

Well, Reddit encourages this kind of behaviour, for a start.  I've never understood why people talk about karma being meaningless.  Of course, the numbers themselves mean absolutely nothing, and I don't think anyone but the seriously naive chases some kind of high score, but it's not the numbers that matter: it's **visibility**.  People don't care about their score, but they sure as hell care about being the top comment, or on the front page, for everyone to see.  It's the internet equivalent of being popular, and without social accountability, people can and will saying anything if they believe it's expected of them to be the most popular comment.  Do we hate Skub this week?  The top comment will be someone denouncing Skub.  Are we tiring of the anti-Skub circlejerk?  The top comment will be about that.  And it just keeps going, on and on and on.

Again, I must stress, we are all subject to this.  *All of us*.  We're human beings, social creatures, and we're wired that way.  When Skyrim was about to come out, I was seriously considering picking it up because everyone on /r/gaming made it sound so cool and exciting.  I began to think this was the game I'd been waiting for.  Then it came out and, surprise, it was just a game with its good and bad points.  Then I remembered that I don't actually like The Elder Scrolls, and felt a bit silly because I'd been sucked into the hype.

The important thing to remember is that this isn't indicative of people's idiocy.  It's simply the effect of holding what essentially amounts to a popularity contest, and that's *totally fine in its place*.  But /r/truegaming wasn't meant to be a popularity contest, or a place where we can reaffirm our values against the 'casuals' or other subreddits.  It was meant to be a place where you can talk about games without all the utterly bullshit social pressure that goes along with being a 'gamer'.  Like Vaes Dothrak, but for games.

A user reported a thread this morning, now removed, in which the top comment was ""fuck spore"" with a link to a screencap of that bit from Revenge of the Sith where Obi-Wan shouts ""you were the chosen one"".  And it made me a little sad.  Not because it didn't blow my mind with a deep philosophical discussion of the implications of Spore, but because I thought *""god fucking damn it, aren't we over Spore yet?""*  Yeah, it was a disappointment, but fucking hell, it was just a game.  There are literally hundreds of games out there worth talking about, good and bad.  Why are we focusing on the same twenty or so, over and over again?

The answer, of course, is that we know, consciously or otherwise, that if we say certain things, we'll be upvoted.  We'll get to be the most popular, visible person on that page.  And so, instead of actually talking about things, Reddit becomes a race to see who can post ""Portal"" first when asked what your favourite short game is.  Or who can post ""dat ---"" first when presented with, well, anything.  We're not making jokes, we're not conversing: we're just trying to shout out the 'right' answer as quickly as possible.  It's not even about word count - you can post a 500 word, well-reasoned defence of why Half-Life 2 is the best game ever and it's still really fucking tiring to read, because everyone everywhere has talked Half-Life 2 to death.  We don't need any more people singing its praises, but we'll continue to do it anyway, because it's a guaranteed way to be popular on the internet.

I can't make you guys talk about certain things, and neither can any of the other mods.  All we can do is ban users and remove comments, and while we'll nuke threads that tread on the line and remove comments here and there that are just completely vapid, we're not about to start a campaign of deleting everything we don't agree with, because sooner or later we'll be accused of taking it too far.

I don't expect to achieve much or turn the subreddit around in one post, but I hope maybe we'll think twice before automatically upvoting the next person who says CoD is for casuals.  Not because it's right or wrong, but because we've heard it a million times before.

I'm going to play some Europa Universalis III.  Man, that game kicks serious ass, though no doubt /gsg/ thinks I'm a babby.  Ah well.

For the entirety of my life, I have loved games of all sorts.  Last April, I accepted an Assistant Manager position at GameStop and that changed dramatically.

Before working with the company, I rarely visited.  Every now and again, I would walk in when bored looking for a strategy guide or maybe a hard to find title like BlazBlue or something.  I absolutely hated their sales pitch and the constant hassling of customers.  On one particular visit, I was greeted by some nice guys.  They were informed, and were genuine about their interest to help me find what I was looking for.  They asked me where I worked and I told them I worked for Pacific Sunwear but was looking for a new job because of the imminent closing of that store.  They were thrilled and offered me a position to be their Assistant Store Manager.  I thought about the position for two weeks before going back and talking with the store manager.  He hired me a few weeks later and sure enough, a few weeks later things went to shit.  

Everything that I was weary about before taking the job came true.  

If you aren't familiar with the way GS handles performance let me explain.  Employees (regardless of their position) are rated by three factors, and three factors **only.** 

 * Reservation
 * Power Up Rewards Cards
 * Customer Survey

Your reservation percentage is a number based on how many **NEW** reservations you received divided by how many transactions you have entered. My store was a low volume store which meant we only made around 11000 dollars a week at the most.  It also meant we did an absurd number of transactions because of the low income area we operated inside.  The average dollar sale was around $19.  That means we did around 580 transactions in a single week.  Simple math tells you that as transactions increase, the oppurtunity for reservations increase.  **That should mean more reservations right?**  What that math fails to point of is the amount of time spent with each customer before the sale.  If you have ever wondered why the employee behind the counter is talking to much, this is why.  We had to put in a ridiculous amount of time with each customer explaining all kinds of bullshit about pre-order this and that **BEFORE** we got to ringing the shit you actually came to buy.  Looking at this from an objective standpoint, it makes no sense.  

The PUR card is much of the same upsellng bullshit and I won't repeat what I said earlier. 

The customer survey or NPS was my favorite.  The hours we worked, were directly affected by this stat.  On every receipt, there is a customer survey number a customer can go home, fill out and rate their experience.  History tells us most of the time people rate anything is when they have had a bad experience.  When have you ever gone to a place of business, waited in line for 15 minutes listening to a salesman go on and on to every customer in front of you after repeatedly being shut down, hearing the same pitch presented to you and had a good experience?  


Remember those two guys that got me hired from earlier?  We were all fired earlier this week.  I know what you're thinking, it because you sucked as a salesman.  During my time there, my store was ranking in the top 100 stores for 5 consecutive weeks, peaking at number 7 out of roughy 6000.  We were the shit.  We killed it despite all of out gripes and were fired anyway.

Three managers, terminated for being nice people.

You see, when you pre-order something at gamestop, they bank on you coming to pick that game up.  The problem I found was that over 70 percent of preorders were **NEVER** picked up.  The reason being because for the most part, the people that preorder shit only do it to shut up the person hassling them.  Our computer had hundreds and hundreds of preorders lost in the system.  Thousands and thousands of dollars sitting.  You may ask what gamestop does with that.  

Well, they get shady is what.  When a pre-order sits for a certain amount of time, based off of the customer, the game, and the business trend, that money becomes positive shrink for the company.  Which means free money.  Money that was earned in return of nothing.  Some people call it stealing...but hey whatever.

We were fired for taking that money, and instead of moving it into the CEO's bonus package, we moved it onto another preorder.  That way, if a customer came back and said, ""Hey, what do I have preordered...I'm pretty sure I still have money in the system?"" We wouldn't say,""Nope, you don't have shit preordered but how about BLACK OPS2!!!!!""

It started with a box a Gears Of War 3.  A box worth 1700 dollars of GOW3 went missing.  They couldn't find it.  Naturally they blamed the management staff and not UPS because they have of course never lost anything.  They did and investigation and said that we had been ""Abusing our power"" with the nature of our fraudulent transactions.  I was fired for moving money back and forth in a system designed to steal it from you.


In closing here are some small tidbits you may want to be aware of.

 * If you feel like you have a preorder and ask ""What do I have preordered?"" The associate will likely say nothing so he/she does not take a cancel.  It hurts their numbers and are actually encouraged to lie to you.
 * New games that have been gutted as display cases have most certainly been played, do not buy those.
 * The PUR card is a total ripoff.  If you are an idiot that trades in games, just what to put those toward a game coming out and you'll get extra trade credit more than likely.  
 * Make sure to inventory **Everything you trade in** because while it was is probably not always on purpose, people to forget to ring your trade and their is nothing they can do afterwards.  Except maybe keep it...
 * Preorder only at **ONE STORE** if you do it.  However, despite what they say, you can transfer your money over if you choose.
 * You don't need any game knowledge to work there. Especially if you have tits.
 * They cry about losing to steam in the PC race.
 * Remember the people behind the counter aren't the company.  Those people just want a job doing something they like.  They don't like asking you to pre-order DLC anymore than you like saying no.


If anyone has any questions about the company I can answer them.  I harbor no ill will towards them, as it was my fault for going against my gut and joining in the first place.  But as an optimistic business major, holy shit is that place all fucked up with morals.  Oh, and the turnover rate is **EXTREMELY HIGH**


**EDIT**  

I wanted to clear a few things up.  

 * A few things I spoke about was largely anecdotal.  I was the ASM.  I was fired for practices I witnessed the SM doing multiple times.  He still has his job.

&gt;You don't need any game knowledge to work there. Especially if you have tits.
 
 * I said this because it's true.  Yes, it is not always the case, but the entire district was filled with incompetent GAs,SGAs,ASMs, and SMs.  Many times when I went and helped other stores, the associates had almost zero game knowledge.  I can't tell you how many times I had to step in to stop a pre-order because associate X told someone if they liked Call of Duty they would LOVE Deus Ex.  Gamers deserve to be sold games they actually want to play.  Not games that are easy to push.

For the most part, I understand that most of my experience was largely based on the management practices in  my district.  I feel like, based on the popular consensus around the internet, Gamestop employs all sorts of terrible business practices and justifies it by saying customers always have ""options.""

**EDIT 2**

Games are by all means, industry.  A machine that can only be fueled by monotony, the lack of self-awareness and decency, propaganda, and mis-information.  As a kid, games were a place I could go to get away from those things.  As the games grew, so did the industry.  Maybe all things started with the honest intent on providing a service otherwise absent and somewhere along the way, someone said, lets exploit this as long as we can.  Gamestop is not an anomaly.  It is not unique in fucking it's customers and employees.  The CEOs and CFOs in charge of these companies were rich before Halo and COD, and they will be rich after.  

My opinion has always been that if, for any reason, publishers decided to abandon physical media GameStop would die.  I stand by that.  I also think they industry will decay.  Maybe that's a good thing.  I'm pretty sure it isn't.  I want this form of media to thrive.  I don't think that should mean being as intrusive and annoying as Gamestop is the only option.

**EDIT 3**

I understand both sides.  As a business student I completely understand why I was terminated.  Again, I harbor no ill will towards gamestop or any of it's employees.  Of course, it's not the worse job in the world and it most certainly isn't the hardest.  I just feel like it sits on the precipice of being something great.  If you are already selling candy, you don't have to force it down people's throats.  People doing their jobs is something I get.  People being okay that their jobs are shitty and ""Thats just the way things are"" is something I do not get.  I'd like to thank everyone for hearing my story.  Good or bad, everyone has to decide who to give their money to, and if GS operated less like a pawn shop and more like a game store, I would be more than happy to visit again.

Maybe using google maps information, and then street view info, cross referencing with pre-made building models to populate actual building lots? Then using some sort of algorithm to populate vehicles and such. Again, I realize I'm probably over simplifying this process.

Disregarding all meta-incentives (achievements, unlockables, etc.), is there anything you usually do before shelving or uninstalling a game, just for the sake of tying off the story in your own mind, or ensuring that your character's ultimate fate is sealed?

Thinking back over the years, I've realized that I seem to have a penchant for decking my character out in the fanciest or most expensive gear available, and then finding the highest possible spot on the game map, taking one last look around, and leaping off.  I've done this in GTA games, Bethesda games, Zelda games, Assassin's Creed — I just always get this feeling like there is nothing else left to do, so I might as well jump.

My favourite jump of all time was after labouriously climbing to the top of the Eiffel Tower in 'The Saboteur' and looking around at the diffuse glow of Parisian streets through the evening rain.  It just felt right.

A joking over-the-top style post about emulators I posted then lead to a few replies about piracy.  

Setting aside the humor though, it makes me question how this type of thing is viewed by others.    I honestly don't see this as piracy in anything but the technical term.  If the developers and producers aren't seeing anything from it, why should the resellers?  A copy of a game from the 90's certainly wouldn't warrant paying someone with no involvement to the creation of the game.

Obviously, collection is another thing all together.  However for the USE of the game, it makes no sense.

So this is my question... is it all the same?  Am I completely off in my thinking that there is nothing at all wrong with emulation of games and gaming systems which are out-dated and forgotten by their producers, no longer being marketed, produced, or touched?  Or is this simple justification?

Simply put, my desire to play with other people is fading away.
  
Journey was one of the most immersive games I've played in recent history.  The atmosphere and imagery were great, and the multiplayer aspect was hailed as being very innovative.  But I unplugged my PS3 when I played the game.  I didn't want anyone else in my game.  It was too linear for me to want or need any kind of direction or guidance.  Not only that, but having another person around created a sense of urgency and impatience.  When I was alone, I could go at my own pace, I could stop to smell the flowers or just sit and look at the dunes for awhile.  When someone else showed up, another person now had direct control over the kind of experience I was going to have.  If they wanted to run circles around me spamming their noise button they could do it.  I didn't have to interact with them at all, but the expectation that I should made me feel rushed.  
  
I've been playing Borderlands 2 for the past couple days.  I enjoyed playing the first one with a friend of mine, so I was looking forward to some cooperation on this one.  Since he doesn't have the game yet, I got into the matchmaking last night at around level 10.  The first thing that happened?  My partner blazed through the level, sometimes passing enemies and pulling them all to a single location where he took them out in large numbers.  I barely had time to shoot before he was onto the next part of the map, baddies in tow.  I'm sure he was a fantastic player, but I wasn't experiencing any of the content.  There was no interaction or communication, just a guy clearing out a path in front of me.  
  
I went back to single player after about 10 minutes.  I took my time when I got into a new area.  I studied my environment and got a feel for the enemy layout.  I figured out my escape routes, looked for any environmental hazards I could use.  And then after the fighting was over, I just looked around.  I searched all the containers.  I practiced my aim on some distant targets.  I looked at my skill trees.  I admired the level design.  I looked for secrets.  I read the writing on the walls and on the paper strewn about.  And the best part was, I had no one to rush on without me or tell me I was taking too long. I could finally relax.
  
There was a time when I loved multiplayer in games, and it wasn't too long ago either.  I still enjoy coop games with friends; games like Guardian of Light, RE5, Portal 2.  But I think the novelty of playing with random strangers has worn off.

I played through the uncharted games recently and I think its strongest point is the cinematic value of the experience. I often play games like uncharted on the easiest difficulty just to get through the story and experience the levels. My gaming time is limited so I get easily frustrated when I keep dying on certain firefights where each enemy takes forever to kill. In the case of uncharted, I wish I could play it more akin to the action/adventure movie it's trying to bring to life where each bad guy dies with one shot or at least falls to the ground and writhes in pain, unable to fight back. 

I think this also applies to Bioshock Infinite, lots of gamers have said that there were times where coming up on a room where cover would be laid about and the gamer would roll their eyes in preparation for a drawn out battle before they could move to the next story piece.

1375951595.0,470,self.truegaming,1jy1f8,What great/interesting games have been ruined by one tiny design choice?,SpaceGhostDerrp,604,134,868,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1jy1f8/what_greatinteresting_games_have_been_ruined_by/,"Two years ago, I was obsessed with a free online shooter game called Ace of Spades.  Some of you have heard the story of how this game was run into the ground when the beta was bought by Jagex, but I think this potentially great game was ruined by one or two small design decisions long before the buyout, earlier in the beta.  

The premise: a first person shooter game capture the flag.  It looked a lot like minecraft with guns, but with one *huge* difference in design: when the base of a structure of blocks is destroyed, all the blocks above it *fall down and disappear* rather than hovering in mid air. 

Since this is a capture the flag game, about half of each team would start building huge castles that the enemy team would have to climb up or destroy to get to the flag.  The entire castle would stay intact as long as a single block touched the floor.  This led to incredibly interesting, complex structures, built by strangers, defended and maintained with no VOIP or communication.  Along with the brutally simple graphics, the simplicity of purpose and game mechanics made for many interesting game sessions.  

I remember hours-long game sessions, digging under the enemy base, trying to knock out a flag tower before I was found out and shot.  All we had to do was kill the defenders, knock down all the supports on the castle around their flag, then steal it and return it to our base.  Games would last for hours, as castles became more intricate, and as the network of tunnels under the map grew.  One player spending 15 minutes digging around to a flank might be enough to take the enemy team by surprise; the only warning for defenders was an unnerving scratching sound coming from the ground below, as the enemy frantically dug through the darkness.  

Another interesting mechanic: whatever was on the map appeared on the minimap.  The location of the flag appeared as a red or blue cross on the minimap, and if you built that figure on the map you could make a decoy.  You could spend ten minutes digging a tunnel under a flag only to find out that the real flag is somewhere else.  There was a brilliant mind-game going on here, that would have been even better with voice chat and organized teams.  

Then they added the ability for guns to shoot and destroy blocks.
You could knock out the supports under a castle from a distance with your gun, so people stopped trying to build anything. When they added machine guns and shotguns, one person could destroy a whole base, so the game just became another generic FPS with terrible graphics.  Enemy fortifications could be destroyed with ease from a safe distance.  There was no need for teamwork, no strategy other than mindlessly charging at the enemy.  

Another terrible design choice: allowing custom maps.  This is the only game I can think of that was made worse by releasing mod tools. 

The original map was randomly generated.  One team would always be in a mountainous region, while the other would be behind a few rivers.  You couldn't dig under the rivers, so it was always a battle to find a crossing.  There was a beautiful unbalance there: the team behind the river had less cover and less ground to defend, while the mountain team had more surface area to defend from tunnels, but had a much larger distance from the flag to the river.  

When they added the ability to make custom maps, the original, randomly generated maps instantly disappeared from the server list. 

The new map-builders forgot to make their maps more than one block thick, which removes the digging mechanic entirely.  These maps were usually flat, so the primitive hit-scan rifles made every map a stalemate.  These custom maps became much more popular than the original, I believe, because this added customization attracted those who were too cheap to buy Minecraft, and did not really care about gameplay.  

There was something beautiful about the early beta.  Every character looked the same, each block was a single color, without texture.  There was only one gun, only one shovel, only one character model.  From a simple start, you could pitch in the build a huge castle to defend your flag, or a massive system of trenches to guard the river crossings, or go to work on a tunnel deep into the mountain, under the enemy base.  

There were moments of greatness in that early build.  Imagine spending ten minutes digging a tunnel towards what you hope is the enemy flag.  You pause to turn around; the light of day forms a tiny square at the end of your tunnel.  Before you start digging again, you hear the faint scratching of another player.  This far into enemy territory, you know it is an enemy, digging in the opposite direction.  The sound is too faint to pinpoint, but you know that moving in any direction might send you spilling into their line of fire.  Of course, if you win the firefight, you will have a clear road into their base, and a quick escape route once you steal the flag.  The tension here, along with the claustrophobia of being under a mile of virtual dirt, was as compelling as any standoff in Counterstrike, as the last two players strain to hear the footsteps of the other player, knowing that a single well-placed shot can end the game, for win or loss.  I have yet to find a multiplayer game so terrifying.  

Sadly, the early beta builds that showed such promise have long been forgotten by the community, who seem content with their Minecraft knockoff.  

**TLDR: With one small update, *Ace of Spades*, once a surprisingly deep Minecraft-based FPS, destroyed all motivations for teamwork.  Long before it was bought out by Jagex, the game designer folded under pressure to be more like Minecraft, and added features that ruined the brutal simplicity that made the original beta builds so intriguing.**

The same can be said of movies, and television, as there is no variety in its consumption. This allows the author to know with fair confidence that the content will digested in the same way, giving a similar experience across the board. **This is useful for analysis as it standardizes the experience to the highest degree for users, allowing everyone to communicate starting from the same point of understanding.**



Now videogames, with their immense complexity, allow much more variation in that respect. Because an end user will be using different weapons, different strategies, and different difficulties, this medium is inherently more diverse in its consumption. This both makes the videogame medium amazing, and problematic. 


**I’m sure many have noticed the difficulty in discussing videogames because everyone is experiencing the same product from a different perspective, with a different play-through every time.** How does this destroy our critical understanding across the board? *Do you view this as problematic? Does it rob us of actual critical analysis, because of that large fluctuation in the experience, and furthermore, does it demean the original artist’s vision?*

**Videogames have a lot of variety within themselves, and rob the end user of a standardized experience. That means the author’s/creative director’s intent is always muddled with one’s experience, and is not able to be compared idealistic, like in that of film/literature.**

Sometimes it's a boss battle that makes no sense and disrupts the flow(Mass Effect 2), sometimes random plot elements get introduced at the last moment that don't seem to fit(Mass Effect 3). Or maybe something bizzare happens with no real explanation that just really disrupts the flow(Halo 4). Or when the game just trails off into 'resolution' that doesn't really make any sense(AC3). Maybe you've been playing a game that's been talking to you about choice the entire time just to have events fly so far out of your control in the last half hour that you're left wondering what in the hell just happend(DA2).

Hell, I once played a game in which the ending took nearly an hour and had a random easy battle in the middle of it. At one point a character dissolved into the ocean and it rained saltwater for 2 weeks straight because of it(Baten Kaitos).

And worse than all of those is when a game just kind of trails off. Not a bad ending, just no ending at all(KOTOR 2).

I love story in games, it's the biggest motivator for me to buy and play through games, and most of the time I'm fairly happy... up until the ending. I can only think of a handful of endings I've ever experienced that were well done. Not just mediocre, but actually good enough that I look back on them with a smile.

1365454877.0,451,self.truegaming,1bxy2h,"If the PC is supposed to be the most versatile gaming platform, why are certain genre's almost entirely avoided?",zac503,685,234,507,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1bxy2h/if_the_pc_is_supposed_to_be_the_most_versatile/,"Certainly in the last 5 years we've seen a wider public adoption of PC gaming. We've also seen more frequent controller use by PC Gamers which I think is largely due to the standardization of Xbox 360 controller support by most developers.

In light of this, I'm surprised that we haven't seen the rise of more games that seem to only exist on certain platforms.

The following genres seem under represented as compared to console and handheld platforms:

* **Party Games** - There is not a huge market for these games as compared to other genre's but certain platforms have had a large amount of success with them, namely the Nintedo Wii. I honestly don't play a lot of these games, but there have been times when I've looked for something on the PC to serve this function, and I've found pretty much nothing to meet this need. I understand the average player doesn't have a computer hooked to their main entertainment center, but for those that do, it seems like structured party games are absent.

* **JRPGS** - This has long been a complaint of PC gamers, and the prevailing justification is that PC gamers prefer Western Style RPGS. I tend to think that this is a cop-out and ignore the fact that JRPGs an WRPGs tend to differ in their mechanics, and both are enjoyable to large groups of gamers. These games also seem to be leaving the traditional console market as well, as we've seen a large increase in the JRPG market on handheld consoles. I'm really not sure why there's such a lack of these games as I would imagine the line up well with the ""Hardcore"" gamer types that a lot of the PC World self identifies towards.

* **Open Ended Casual Games** - I know that the PC market is over saturated with a huge variety of web/flash based games on sites like kongregate. My concern is that a web based environment doesn't offer people the same structured approach that people expect in a system like PSN, or Steam. Games like Animal Crossing, Viva Pinata, and Harvest Moon have experienced a large amount of success on their system, and I've never found anything that offers a similar experience on the PC. There are plenty of PC simulation games, but they tend to stray towards the ""Sink or Swim"" style of simulation that tasks players to micromanage lots of variables in an active time situation. I've found that this type of simulation is exceedingly stressful to me, and has the opposite effect of something like Animal Crossing, which offers a ""Latching"" style of game play where it's almost impossible for players to make negative progress. 

And while I would identify as a ""Dedicated Gamer"", who has a variety of consoles and have maintained at least 1 if not 2 higher end gaming PCs for the last 5 years. I find myself in the common situation that most late 20 somethings find themselves in where I have more money to buy games, but less time to play them. 

As a long time PC gamer, I find that many of the core PC gaming experiences are lost on me, as I simply don't have enough time to dedicate to ever changing competitive gaming scene. 3 years ago I decided to implement my own version of a Steambox style HTPC, and while I've enjoyed it tremendously, there is still a large swath of gaming experiences that don't exist in the PC market. Valve has heading in the right direction by introducing Steam's Big Picture mode, but this has done little to increase the breadth and variety in the software market. 

My hope is that with the increased visibility of PC gaming to the console demographic, PC game developers will start delivering some of these fringe gaming experiences. Much like the iOS App store at it's launch. I would think that the first person to deliver a legitimate Animal Crossing style game to the PC is going to make piles of cash. If they could take advantage of player created content via the Steam Workshop, I think they would have a product that would easily best the previous games in this genre. 

When it's all said and done, I would love for the PC to offer more gaming experiences that work better for my fiancé, based on the games she loves to play. While games like Skyrim and Borderlands have occupied many hours of her time, I know she would love to have access to many of those simple yet deep games that show up each console generation.

The submission title should ask where ""you"" draw the line, not ""we"".

You form your own opinions. But we should all be informed consumers.

## I am constantly editing and adding in arguments made in the comments

I came up with some, not all, of these arguments. The ones that seem debatable to me I've noted as debatable. If you see a problem, point it out and I'll try to fix it. There are points that are arguably irrelevant, but I have not yet marked these. People have already pointed out irrelevant points, but feel free to point them out again until I've marked them.

## The Anti Xbox One Bias

/u/goldegl kindly pointed out that [this is not a fair discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1fzj1p/xbox_one_drm_vs_steam_drm_where_do_we_draw_the/cafg2nv?context=3). The list is currently biased against Xbox One, and I welcome anyone to make points in Xbox One's favour. I did not create all these points on my own.

There are points that are unconfirmed, and I've tried to make note of this. If something unconfirmed is presented as fact, point it out. Some argue that even mentioning the unconfirmed points is just creating bias, but I think some of the unconfirmed points are reasonable informed speculation, and would rather let people decide for themselves whether it's true.

There are points that are irrelevant, and feel free to point those out. I am not attempting to make note of them too. But I find that debatable as well. In particular, Steam is a platform that runs on the PC, and trying to discuss Steam without mentioning the PC is unrealistic.

## My bias: I personally think Steam's DRM is better, but Xbox One is not necessarily evil

Let me point out that post initially almost defended XBox One, pointing out the similarities and arguing that it is slightly worse. It is only after collecting comment feedback that the list of Steam benefits grew huge.

But Steam being better I just a opinion. I personally agree, but feel free to argue against it. The lack of points supporting Xbox One reflects the lack of comments supporting Xbox One.

Xbox One being evil is just an opinion, and one that I'm staying neutral on.

## I am trying to be fair

The arguments I present are in favour of Steam because that reflects what the comments say.

So far, nobody has argued that Xbox is better. However, I have seen people argue that Xbox is not evil.

## Are Xbox One and Steam even comparable or worth comparing?

If you hate Xbox One, you should know compare them and explain why one is worth hating and the other isn't. You don't want to be a hypocrite.

I've heard people say it's apples and oranges and not worth comparing. Is it apples and oranges? It depends on what you think that means, but yes, these are two very different platforms. One is software. One is hardware.

But is worth comparing? I think so, because despite differences, there's clearly a similarity here. There has never been a console with this much DRM, but Steam is a PC platform with similar but not identical DRM. If we want insight into Xbox One, we shouldn't deny gaining insight from a platform that shares similarities, and also acknowledge the differences.

## Is there an anti-Xbox One circlejerk?

[If this comment is true](http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1fzj1p/xbox_one_drm_vs_steam_drm_where_do_we_draw_the/cafh4ro), there is an anti Xbox One circlejerk in /r/truegaming , and that's bad. Maybe you think that's obviously true, or that it's obviously false, but I believe it's unobviously true.

A circlejerk ([defnition](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/zanht/the_difference_between_a_hivemind_and_a/)) implies lack of self awareness, unwillingness to accept alternate views, and unwillingness to accept the existence of the circlejerk. There is clearly a hivemind mentality that Xbox One is bad, but that is not obviously a circlejerk. What makes this a circlejerk is that apparently those supporting Xbox One have been downvoted and called corporate shills. Some of them probably are corporate shills, while others are just people who like the Xbox One.

If the circlejerk exists, I implore everyone to think before downvoting instead of assuming everyone is a troll or shill. Otherwise, we could be dangerously squashing discussion and promoting censorship, which is *far* worse than DRM.

## Is the Xbox One evil?

I don't know about evil, but I can tell you all about ethically right and wrong using my silly undergraduate ideas after taking a Business Ethics class, an Introduction to Philosophy class, and an Economics class.

In common ethical theory, whether an action is right and wrong is actually considered an objective fact; one that we as humans are incapable of knowing with certainty, but that we can try our best to discover. In this case, we are not discussing an action, but a product, but perhaps the same rules apply.

The two main ethical positions are consequentialism and deontology. Consequentialism says that if the consequences are good, the action is ethically right. Deontology say that there is a list of actions that are ethically right, and the action that adheres to them best is ethically right. But deontology's tricky since you need the list, so let's stick with consequentialism.

If we assume that evil means ethically wrong, is the Xbox One evil? It depends on how much good it does!

Which leads us to economics and capitalism, which would argue that if the Xbox One finds a market, it's fulfilling a need. And fulfilling the needs of these people sounds good! Except maybe it's actually bad in the long term because it leads to DRM taking over the market. Except capitalism says that the market will eventually stabilize on what is best for everyone, so if DRM really is that bad, the market will kill it. Except... capitalism isn't perfect, and it assumes consumers with perfect market knowledge.

But the gist is that if someone wants an Xbox One and knows exactly what they're getting, we can argue why we believe they are wrong, but they're not necessarily evil and the Xbox One isn't necessarily evil. So stop downvoting legitimate discussion unless you're really sure it's a troll or market shill. And even then, sometimes trolls and shills make legitimate points.

## This is post is about used game prevention DRM, not used games

There are two issues here. One, are used games sales good or bad? Two, is the means of preventing used games sales good or bad? This discussion is about issue two. TotalHalibut/TotalBiscuit made popular Youtube video with a reasonable argument in favour of the elimination of used games on consoles, but he's talking about *used games*, *not DRM*. This is about *how* we prevent used games, and the side effects of that DRM.

## Steam and XBox One's shared flaws

Let's go through the [XBox One DRM checklist](http://images.lazygamer.net/2013/06/XboxOneFailures.png) ([source](http://www.lazygamer.net/24/microsoft-confirms-insane-xbox-one-drm/)). Note that this is an anti-XBox One image, and is a biased attempt to prove its flaws. I know that. I used it initially to point out Steam's similar flaws. People in comments pointed out ways that these flaws are reduced in Steam. Take that for what it is.

On Steam:

* Must connect to server every 24 hours? Some games (don't know how many) must connect to the server every 2 weeks according to [this Redditor](http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1fzj1p/xbox_one_drm_vs_steam_drm_where_do_we_draw_the/cafbbxb). [Anecdotal evidence.](http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1fzj1p/xbox_one_drm_vs_steam_drm_where_do_we_draw_the/cafdve0)

* Cannot trade, or sell games? You made trade or sell if the game was bought specifically as a gift and never played. [There is *arguably* a way to lend games,](http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1fzj1p/xbox_one_drm_vs_steam_drm_where_do_we_draw_the/caff4sh?context=3) though I'm not sure whether it's legal. People also argue that since Steam has frequent sales and low prices, lend/trade/sell isn't necessary, though this could be debated.

* Note that the Kinect sensor is always on by default, but that [it can be turned off](http://news.xbox.com/2013/06/privacy).

* Note that Xbox One allows a limited form of lending games. Only to people who have been on your friends list more than 30 days, and only once (whatever that means). Steam does not support any lending.
* Note that Microsoft has said nothing about rentals, so there's nothing to compare there. It's all speculation.

[Here is an offical non-comprehensive technical explanation of Steam's DRM.](http://www.steampowered.com/steamworks/publishingservices.php) 
[This Redditor also explain it well.](http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1fzj1p/xbox_one_drm_vs_steam_drm_where_do_we_draw_the/cafdass?context=3)

And an extra point not on that list. On Steam:

* DRM built in at the hardware level? No

## Steam's Benefits

But Steam doesn't just lack the flaws; it has other benefits.

**You may NOT legally break DRM on computer games! Except sometimes.** [Source.](http://www.tomshardware.com/news/drm-dmca-jailbreaking-unlocking-iphone,10944.html) Thanks to /u/ShadowTheReaper for [pointing it out](http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1fzj1p/xbox_one_drm_vs_steam_drm_where_do_we_draw_the/cafcsw1). Thanks to /u/goldegl for [pointing out that the article does not actually allow us to break the DRM](http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1fzj1p/xbox_one_drm_vs_steam_drm_where_do_we_draw_the/cafg2nv) and for pointing out that XBox One DRM may be broken by people in the military (though no source was cited).

Confirmed benefits:

* Not all games have DRM; it's optional for the developer

* The PC can do things other than use Steam. Note that Xbox One can also do other things, as mentioned in the Xbox one benefits.

* Steam is now multiplatform: Windows, Mac, Linux. Not all games are, but the Steam support is there.

* The PC has competing digital game distribution services; XBox One locks you into theirs

Generally agreed upon benefits:

* Steam games are cheap. We don't actually know that XBox One games will be expensive, but some suspect it because Xbox One is a closed platform with no competition, or arguably only competition from Wii U and PS4. Steam, on the other hand, had several competitors. But this is still just speculation.

Benefits related to how Steam *feels*:

* Steam has unobtrusive advertisements that are all for games; Advertising on XBox One remains to be seen, but one Redditor says Xbox 360 ads were also unobtrusive

* Steam doesn't use disks, and while it's just a feeling, it feels worse not being able to trade a physical disk than a digital download

## Debatable Points

* Steam has reliable servers. Not everyone agrees on this, and [Steam does have downtime](http://twitter.com/Steam_Support).

* Steam offers social services, like connecting with your friends, seeing their achievements, sending them messages, but so will XBox One. It remains to be seen whether they do a good job of it though.

* Steam offers cloud services, like accessing your game library or your game's save state from any device. However, XBox 360 offered cloud saves, and XBox One might also offer these features.

* Steam games probably won't stop working at the end of a console generation. Some people believe that XBox One games will. This is debatable.

* Steam is free. Except the PC itself isn't. This is a fact, but people disagree over whether it's can be considered a benefit.

* People have said that Steam would provide the games DRM free if it ever shut down, but [there is no recorded official statement of this](http://steamcommunity.com/discussions/forum/0/828933455838324563/). I have, however, gathered some evidence. [This Redditor asked Steam Support](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/18mzcn/i_asked_steam_support_what_happens_to_my_games_if/). It says users will have access to their games, but that does not mean DRM free. Also note that Microsoft may very well have the same policy; perhaps someone should contact Xbox Support and ask.

## Offsetting DRM with other benefits?

Many people point out the benefits provided by Steam to offset the DRM.

However, if you say that DRM can be offset by enough benefits, you're saying that XBox One's bad DRM can also be offset by benefits. We don't know *everything* about XBox One yet, so this gets into tricky territory. It also turns this in to a pure Xbox One vs Steam discussion, instead of being about the DRM. If that's the case, I can see why some people feel this is an apples and oranges comparison that's not worth having at this time.

On the other hand, people have been complaining about the XBox One so far largely based on the DRM even though we don't know everything about the console yet. But this may be because even though we don't know everything, we know enough to make informed guesses, and those guesses lead to XBox One being bad.

This also again means that you do not hate XBox One only for its DRM; it is a consideration of all it's factors. And nobody ever said otherwise. So again, maybe it was unwise of me to start this discussion so soon.

On the other hand, maybe some people believe XBox One's DRM is unforgivable, no matter what else they do. If you're one of those people, then this is a perfectly reasonable discussion. The question is then just what was the last straw with XBox One's DRM, and what would make it acceptable.

I acknowledge that not everybody shares the same opinion. I've used the word ""we"" instead of ""you"" or ""one"" at times, which was wrong. It's why I included that disclaimer at the top about individual opinion.

## XBox One's Benefits

* Xbox One can do all sorts of things like playing movies, watching Netflix. It's pretty much what the launch presentation was about. On the other hand, [this Redditor](http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1fzj1p/xbox_one_drm_vs_steam_drm_where_do_we_draw_the/cafug7x?context=3) notes that you can already do these things (on PC?), but on Xbox One you have to pay a monthly fee for it. I'm not entirely clear on what Xbox One is offering, so I don't know whether it's worth it.

* As said in [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1fzj1p/xbox_one_drm_vs_steam_drm_where_do_we_draw_the/cafdjuu?context=3) 'everyone in your ""family"" can potentially have access to your library even on different consoles'

* One Redditor suggests that the integration with the Microsoft ecosystem will be interesting: Windows 8, Windows RT, Windows Phone 8, and Xbox One.

## Steam is still DRM

Steam is about the best DRM out there, and if I need to use a platform with DRM, I prefer Steam. But I still avoid Steam whenever possible if there is an alternative, and I use it rarely. GOG.com and HumbleBundle.com both sell DRM free games. And you may not know it, but Humble Bundle actually operates as a store beyond its sales. It doesn't list the games in the store though (no idea why). The developer links to the game's Humble Store page, where you can then purchase the game.

I removed this comment for a while because I felt my own opinion on whether to use Steam is not relevant to the discussion, but the point has been raised in the comments a couple times so I'm adding it back.

I'm only up to Disc 2 at this point, but I can now say -- without a doubt -- that nostalgia plays no part in why I considered it such a great game.

The way the text appears on the screen, the negative space, the camera perspective .. It's amazing, and FF9 (as well as 8 and 7) are *full* of this type of visual direction.  Sometimes you see the scene from above, other times from a far away vantage point, and other times your view is obstructed by architecture.  Here are other examples of what I mean:

- http://imgur.com/ASwa9  Steiner in the foreground, but his attention (and yours) is on the tower in the distant background.  Camera angle directly relates to the plot at hand.

- http://imgur.com/YpxRq  Partially obstructing wall, three characters in the conversation that are visually very distinct and isolated by negative space.

- http://i.imgur.com/alQqM.jpg  From FF7.  Most of the game is at a slightly isometric view, but here, in the church, it is changed to a much closer view.

The older 3D titles -- 7, 8, 9 -- were ~~directed much like movies~~ (a few have suggested that they were laid out like graphic novels/comics .. and I think that is a more fitting description).  10 slowly began to widdle away this type of aesthetic, 12 all but abandoned it, and 13 is as flat as it gets.  Interactions between characters in 10, 12, and 13 almost exclusively use boring, meaningless camera angles that are actually very common in TV dramas.  Aesthetics and very important negative space are thrown out the window for a 'functional' scene.

Anyway, back to that first screenshot of Steiner.  Besides being a great example of visuals, it also works well as a storytelling mechanism.  This scene in particular is a transition between a relaxed walk through a town (Treno) and a more action-oriented heist.  It serves as a moment for the characters to reflect on whats going on, providing great pacing and characterization.  It's, in essence, a literary device used in a game.

There are other examples of ""literary devices"" used throughout FF9.  Before you embark on a journey with Garnet through a series of trams across the countryside, you meet (and help) a chubby, ""Part-Time Worker"" who has a small story to tell.  As you traverse the trams and stations, she just so happens to be taking the same route, filling in a seat next to you.  Her part in the story is over, but her mere presence between scene A and scene B provides a consistency and a connection between the two places.  In FF7, ""Johnny"" shows up randomly throughout the game for a similar purpose.

Even at the very beginning of FF9, you bounce fluidly between scenes of the play, scenes of the Queen watching, scenes of Vivi sneaking into the show, and scenes of Zidane chasing the princess around.  They weave together wonderfully, story-wise *and* visually.  This is maintained through the rest of the game with the Side-Events that you can watch by pressing select.  It helps the world seem much more alive, and expands the game world past what's on your screen at the time.

Compared to older titles, the newest games just ...  go.  They might have interesting lore, but they aren't told interestingly.  

I'm at the point of rambling, but I think if you haven't played FF9 recently, you'd be floored at how well it is presented.  It is the pinnacle, in my opinion, of what 7 and 8 were refining at the time.  I would give a leg for Square to go back to this type of 'literary' storytelling and direction.

Let's do away with the ""industry is sinking"" fear-mongering, please.

I'm here to lay out an argument as to why I *completely* and *wholeheartedly* disagree. **I posit that we're in the best time for media, both in film, games, television, and web** (not too keen on comic books or literature conceptions, sorry). I’ll be speaking about games, specifically.

 
---


**Confirmation Bias, Nostalgia, and Golden Age Thinking**


It's pretty easy to see how much of these strong opinions are formed because of a failure to consider the actual state of the industry. Often a singular example will be provided and compared to a great example from the past. ""No one is making games like Ocarina of Time anymore, and we're stuck with crap like EA Sports and Wii Fitness. Where's the innovation?!"" 



It’s important to note that firstly, in making a comparison like this **it’s imperative that we at the very least measure across the same genre**. If we’re going to be comparing a great game like Ocarina of Time to something, it had best stack up against another Zelda, or a type of adventure game that has the same goals/constructions. Likewise, if we’re to bash a game like EA Sports, we gotta compare it to a sports game from the past. 



“But RAA, that won’t provide any measure of objective discussion, since nostaligia is still possible.” True, we cannot. The only way to get a decent subjective opinion on these games would be to have a person well versed in gaming (across the years) play both games without knowing their influence or history. 



That’s tough to pull off, and we have to be able to compare them across eras another way. I find a LOT of people will willfully regard the great games of yesteryear while bad-mouthing games of today to fit their rationalization. It’s highly easy to forget just how many awful games came out during these time periods that no one remembers. It’s easy to recall controversial games today because they are on our forebrains, but we only remember the positive experiences in our youth (youth being another confound that ruins our discussion). We only really remember the incredibly *awful* games like Dakitana and ET, but remove the mediocre examples from memory, whilst today mediocre is elevated to “horrible!”



It would be interesting to see if someone has a categorical aggregator where we can compare game critical reception across the years. Theoretically checking to see how many good/bad ratio games we see in 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, etc. I don’t know of this tool, but I’d bet good money on the fact that more games are rated positively these days (this is disregarding the also-commonly stated “our review system is totally broken!” notion). 



Another incredibly important notion is just how many more games are coming out these days in comparison to before. **We are over-saturated with great titles!** It’s easy to take them for granted. It makes the comparison of “I played OoT for 100 hours while only playing Mass Effect 3 for 40 hours” an uneven comparison, since we have many other great titles to steal our attention away, not to mention other mediums. 



So even if we take all these into account, it’s clear what *this section is balancing is just how hard it is to truly compare our feelings across time and platform, genre, and experience level/youth*. So how can we compare games, and how the fuck can I have the gall to claim it’s better nowadays? 


---


**Subjective vs. Objective discussions:**


When we state that games suck nowadays compared to prior years, we’re usually almost exclusively making a subjective statement about the game. These statements fall prey to the above mentioned problems (youth, confirmation bias, taking our multitude of other options for granted, lack of comparison across genres, etc). Other **subjective categories** are aspects of the game like the storyline, the aesthetics (style of visuals, not the graphics themselves; that’s *objective*), character motivation, player dialogue, goals of the player, acting, general feel, and presentation, and likely more aspects that are based solely on one’s opinion. 



Now these subjective qualities have tons of value and I cannot infringe on one’s opinion for liking a particular storyline or aesthetic over another. It’s an opinion, and all opinions have value. However, one would **need** to provide supporting arguments to make that opinion more valuable. – [See my elaboration on opinion here](http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1d658d/ethics_in_game_design_a_question_regarding/c9p73it) – 


Comparing these subjective qualities across the board can be fun, but is reliant on how *well* the players argue for their opinions. The support they provide can dictate the merit, but in the end one can more or less state that they “agree to disagree”. 



**Objective categories of a game comparison across time/genre include** aspects like game length, amount of features the game includes, types of modes like MP or SP and Co-op, types of memory saving, UI and HUD integration, graphical fidelity and resolution/polygon count, variations in physics (somewhat skewed toward *subjective*, physics is, I think), online capabilities, gameplay variation (types of different distinct aspects to gameplay), technological advances that play into visuals/audio/controller based aspects, and general layers of complexity/gauging holistic intent. These can all be discussed with an eye for objective measures. 



Now, it’s not too controversial to state that almost every single *objective categorical* I labeled is pretty much better *on average* for today’s gaming in comparison to any year prior. There are probably exceptions in every category, but abstracting these concepts away from any games themselves, it’s easy to see how the industry and our advances have allowed every one of these to improve. These objective categoricals can be used to state that the nature of our industry is one of massive growth and impressive fortitude, as it has games on average better in every way objectively than games of yesteryear.  


With the *objective side* falling heavily in favor of contemporary games, and the *subjective side* falling prey to many challenges in discussion, we’re left with a heavy skew towards suggesting games nowadays are better than older games. How you provide subjective defenses either way is up to you, but **note** *that the improvements in objective categories for all games has likewise improved the subjective categories as well*. 

---

**Lack of innovation and creativity in today’s games**


I don’t buy this argument. In fact, I consider it to be bullshit. To state this is a failure to understand that almost every idea in media and thinking comes from a previous mind. Every idea is a culmination of other ideas. Even crazy new fantastic ideas are generally the mixture of two previous ideas, an improvement of an older idea, or a new skew/spin on an old idea. Ideas get used all the time! And what is wrong about seeing a better, more holistic/complex version of the same idea? Not much, in my opinion. Even full remakes have no inherent negative value, since they don’t hurt the original versions in any way and are “take it or leave it” mediums.  Remakes are an exercise in seeing if the objective technological improvements and know-how can improve the general storyline. Sometimes they work well, and sometimes they don’t. 



In fact, I contest that the MORE sources we have been exposed to and the MORE ideas have been used up are just MORE resources for a new writer/creator to borrow from. Many years ago, when games were in their infancy, new ideas could only be chipped away or experimented at. A great holistic experience didn’t come to fruition until much later. Now, a writer/creator can source from 1000s *more* games/movies/ideas than before to pick and choose what he/she thinks works, fails, or is useless. They create a new product by tweaking, the way it’s always been done. Difference now is that we’re approaching almost-complete world-constructs in games. Some of the open-world games are more or less miniature universes on our own; a digitized life, if you will. 



Can we objectively discuss creativity and innovation in games? Perhaps. Using the terminology I laid out, I think subjectively it struggles to be compared, but objectively we are clearly more advanced now than ever before (save for the Colecovision, that prodigy). We’ve got HD gaming, 3D gaming, wireless headsets, voice activation, multitudes of new advanced features in our MP games, Kinect and motion gaming, the Oculus rift, the [Illumiroom](http://www.extremetech.com/gaming/154439-microsofts-illumiroom-peripheral-projector-is-the-xbox-720s-killer-feature) (my personal favorite of the new techs, by far based on that video), and much more. Can we objectively state these are more impressive technologies and abilities? I’d say it’s pretty damn easy to argue that. 

---

I’d have to venture to say that gaming is in its best state of health right now, and only getting better day by day. With the upcoming new gen, there is so much to be unveiled and so many new ideas on the horizon, while traditional types of games are getting more love and more releases, and indie-gaming is exploding to fill our smaller niches. As far as the games go themselves, we consumers have the best possible time, and I think it’s perplexing to see the multitudes of overly vocal commenters/gamers bashing modern-day gaming whilst creating a sense of panic and duress within the industry. 


It’s sad that we decide to hate on an industry that is so amazing in regards to media. Gaming towers over movies/literature in many ways due to complexity, and is a pioneer of technological progression. To see gamers move to denounce our industry works only to further segregate gamers apart from the mass appeal of film/television/literature, and I aim to help correct that. 



The best way to support our industry is to advocate if we want to see more innovation, to praise the great ideas we do see, and to recognize when we’re taking our passion for granted. What I have laid out may or may not be how the average gamer speaks/thinks, but it’s certainly felt that the popular/mainstream opinion is that we’re in a gaming slump, at least as far as vocal online “critical thinkers” announce. 


I suspect I’ll receive a lot of a certain kind of opinion, but I encourage you voice your thoughts with supporting arguments/evidence and elevate your opinion to a high status. 


**TL;DR**

*Games are better in so many ways nowadays as compared to any previous year. Confirmation bias, nostalgia, and golden age thinking tends to cloud our judgment when comparing games today to yesteryear. Subjective and Objective categories should be well defined in order to discuss them fully and see what can be compared across generations/genres. Even with that it’s easy to see how much progression the objective categories have advanced in games. More games and products means more resources to choose from when writing a story or creating a game, thus allowing for more innovation, not less. I reckon it’s valuable to keep these considerations in mind lest we begin making uneven analogies or comparing games in unbalanced ways, whilst also creating a panic about our state of gaming, which, as I have attempted to lay out, is pretty much better now than it ever has been and only getting stronger.*

I have just played through  Gears of War Judgement, which is a decent sequel, of the not really as good as previous games type. They haven't made many changes to the gears formula,  but one of the few they made annoyed me a great deal. Instead of having a grand sweeping narrative they broke the game into 15-20 minute sections,  and then they assigned a score to each section, with the aim to get up to 3 stars per section, yes, like Angry Birds. So they manage to take a grand sweeping (if massively violent) narrative and turn it into a score attack game. 
                                                                                                                                                                       I as a gamer I don't respond well to being told that I am playing a game wrong,  and that is exactly what this was. You may well be having fun and then the game happily points out that you really should have gotten a couple more headshots and you were knocked down one too many times to get the 3 stars.  Well screw you game,  it is my choice I will play the way I want and not let you put me off having fun.  I had a very similar feeling when they introduced mission completion percentages into the Assassin's Creed games with Brotherhood. The whole idea essentially saying that, well yes you haven't failed,  but you haven't done it properly,  have you.  



This is a concerning turn for me,  I know that I am probably in the minority here but while I love games I hate restrictions. The idea that there is an optimal way to play,  the ""right"" way annoys me more than it really should. I realise that games are inherently performing obstacles,  but the way really good games do it  is by offering a great experience that allows you to forget this.  And stuff like star ratings are merely reminders that you are, essentially,  jumping through hoops for no real reasons. And for simple puzzle games like tetris that is fine,  because it is giving you are chance play through things again and again to beat scores, there is no narrative to get in the way. 

It is strange because I loved People Can Fly's previous game, Bulletstorm, which had a similar scoring mechanic. However that game rejoiced in the silliness of the scoring and had a narrative to explain it, something that neither Assasin's Creed or Judgement have (ok AC does but barely). But perhaps more importantly whilst being creative with the kills in Bulletstorm was encouraged, it never made me feel like I have failed for not getting the elusive mega monster kill.

Those who went in expecting a generic shooter came out much more surprised and discomforted by what they just played than someone who already knew its ending. Presuming one thing but receiving another heightened the Spec Op's unique theme. Can this same effect be utilized in a horror game but still gain a profit?

For example, you go to the store and find this recently published game that is titled with some generic name. When you play the game, you increasingly feel as if something is wrong, as if something isn't right. As you progress, the story becomes more twisted and strange and transforms into a horror game. Descending deeper results in the player becoming more and more confused. They wonder if there is a glitch in the software, but soon realize is was all planned. Somethings simply don't fit into the game and go beyond what they would expect from an RPG. It removes your weapons and completely changes pace and focus until it transforms into a full blown horror game.

Imagine buying a game where the player expects a RPG, where they can explore and level, but then experience a completely different experience as they descend deeper into the game. The player goes down the original questline but is unexpectedly given a quest labeled in glitched text. The player decides to ignore the quest until he/she is done with the main storyline, but when ever they try to talk with an NPC they refuse to interact, completely ignoring the player. The player decides to follow the marker to a house, but when he/she enters they cannot leave, they cannot save/load, they cannot attack, and they cannot open up any menus. From there, the game completely changes pace, turning into a totally different experience. The past story is completely irrelevant and the entire narrative transitions into a seemingly glitchy horror game.

Could this kind of game work? Spec Ops: The Line utilized this kind of ~~false advertising~~ twist to becoming one of the best suprises of 2012. Can a game use this same kind of effect to completely horrify players?

Because apparently anything that isn't analogous to those 4 is some supposedly horrific cancer that's killing survival horror?

I just read about a new game described as: from the creator of Resident Evil 4, a game that combines the atmosphere of Amnesia and the action of Dead Space. 

The PC remake of Dementium 2 promises the ""haunting experience of Amnesia"" with a ""claustrophobic Silent Hill-like atmosphere and soundtrack!""

Here's an actual quote about another one: ""Some say Dead Space is becoming too action-oriented, like Resident Evil. Routine is what you would get if you crossed Amnesia with Dead Space.""

If you look at just about any site's list of top anticipated horror games of 2013, they proceed to (of course) feature Dead Space 3, Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs. Nothing unusual there, those games look fantastic! Except that a good amount of the other members of the list invariably will proceed to whack off the magic four.

So many people seem taken with this idea that there was once a golden age of survival horror, and that the now-feeble genre is in its dying throes. The only reason for any stagnation is that we're not moving on. That's not to say that there aren't fantastic new horror games coming out. What's tragic is that they have to use old giants as crutches when it comes to marketing themselves. Games on Kickstarter and Greenlight make this painfully apparent.

We've got this singular obsession with a small few fantastic games we once enjoyed, and respond with outrage to anything different. There are only so many times we can remake Silent Hill 2 without all once-fresh ideas drying up to nothing. I can't understand why it is that horror fans seem to hate everything new. Look at what happened to Silent Hill 4, a game that was objectively excellent, when it broke pace with the traditional Silent Hill formula (menu style, unkillable monsters, an ally for part of the game.) These changes did not make the game worse in any way other than that they were different, as they were a distinct, additive part of the game's atmosphere. Silent Hill: Downpour was similarly panned despite that it was a great game; one of its critics literally said that his negative attitude toward the game was a result of it not having any of the characters from *~*~*~THE ORIGINAL GAMES~*~*~*~*. (Nevermind that the ""Original Games"" had no real relevance to one another.)

Though to a much greater extent than we dislike things that are dissimilar, similar qualities greatly appeal to us and help sell a game. We're using old elements as shorthand for quality. The original Silent Hill is known for having a good soundtrack, so whenever a new horror game has effective soundtrack, we call it ""Silent Hill-like."" It's not ""good--"" it's Silent Hill-like!


Entire games aren't quantifiable into abstract terms like ""action,"" ""atmosphere"" and ""tone."" If something is dark and you hear noises in the background, you could analogize it to literally any horror game. People just pick Amnesia because it is an artificial way of making their game sound good. ""My game uses sounds effectively!"" just doesn't sell as well or sound as good as ""Remember that one time you played that game and thought it was awesome? Well this is just like that!""

I'm not saying it's impossible for a game to be good without leaning on industry giants, there are plenty of fantastic horror games that have come out over the years. My issue is that we're using similarity to these giants as selling points. You don't see ""REMINDS ME OF WUTHERING HEIGHTS"" and ""DISTINCTLY A ROOM WITH A VIEW"" on the front of new books in the romance section of a bookstore. Gritty action movies can be compared to Tarantino films, but still exist outside of that archetype. 

I can't help but think less of a person for bemoaning ""the death of survival horror"" and craving ""the games of the golden age."" It's dying because we're telling developers we want the same 4 games each time. The fabled golden age IS what is killing survival horror.

Does anyone know when this started?  It seems like every game in this genre does this now.  Resistance 2 was particularly bad in this respect.

Even Spec Ops: The Line, which has a good plot, still hides important pieces of characterization and context in these intel packets.  Besides obviously obfuscating the plot, this also screws up the pacing by causing you to look in every corner during what are supposed to be  intense fire-fights.  Also, linear FPS games often tend to have a lot of awkward invisible walls which you only notice when you're scrounging around for intel, which just makes matters worse.

**Edit:** I'm not against info packets or intel that are used as a storytelling tool or to save money on voice acting or whatever.  I'm against *hidden* info packets that make it annoying for someone who wants the backstory to get it. 

**Edit2:** Just found this timely quote from Yahtzee:

&gt;The other popular technique is of course to sprinkle documents around the place, which combines the necessary exposition with a collectibles hunt. And which does mean that anyone who wants to keep a sense of flow going and doesn't feel like poking around in every concealed nook gets left behind narratively, and I don't think having enough necessary background to have any kind of engagement in the story is something that should be left as an optional bonus. That'd be like leaving the stunning twist ending of a film for the DVD extras.

You know, you gotta hand it to Ken Levine and the Irrational crew. They really know how to deliver great games with strong themes and story coupled with amazing gameplay. But, what they really do well is take apart the concept of a game and work that into the story itself, creating a meta experience that causes you to sit and think.

Ken first did it with his underwater spiritual successor to System Shock 2 (which admittedly did a lot of things that Bioshock did as well, so more like second). **Bioshock**, for those who did not know, is a deconstruction of single-player games. What this means is that the elements that make Bioshock a game were used to weave the story. Basically, the game questioned whether or not you actually had a freedom of choice.

So, how do you make a sequel to a blockbuster hit without failing hard?

Ken did it by making an infinite number of sequels.

The Twist is Booker is Comstock
-----

    ""That idiot priest needs to learn the difference between baptizing a man and drowning one.""
          -Booker DeWitt

Alright, I'm going to explain the twist ending of **Bioshock Infinite**. You were warned in the title, so don't yell at me about spoilers. I'm going to summarize this as quickly as I can. A better, in-depth look at the ending is [here](http://venturebeat.com/2013/03/28/understanding-bioshock-infinites-ending-ending-explanation/). Basically, if it's a little hard to wrap your head around, just think Looper or 12 Monkeys.

In the beginning, after the trauma of the Battle of Wounded Knee, Booker chooses to baptize or not baptize 

* If he doesn't go through with baptism, then Booker and goes on to become a thug for the Pinkertons, although he manages to father a young daughter, Anna. However, he loses his daughter to Comstock, whether by deal or by force. 20 years later, Booker crosses over to the Comstock timeline to get his daughter back with the help of the Lutece twins. However, upon doing so, his memories get muddled up and thus believes he is simply undergoing a simple retrieval, which leads us to the beginning of the game. Whatever the outcome of Booker's adventures in the game, Booker realizes that with infinite worlds, there will always exist infinite Comstocks. He then goes back to the point where he makes the decision whether or not to be baptized. But, by doing so, his memories become muddled, and again he arrives at this two fold situation, creating the infinite loop. Each loop will have different events that occur, but it will always come back full circle.

* If he goes through with baptism, he becomes Zachary Comstock, who goes on to create his fantastical city-in-the-sky and uses dimensional tears to further his own ideals. Comstock then crosses over to the Booker timeline where he takes Anna away from Booker. However, upon doing so, he kills Lady Comstock and attempts to kill the Lucete twins. However, the Lutece twins instead begin to exist outside of the timelines, thus allowing them to see the loop they created and their decision make things right. Their solution is to go get Booker from that other timeline.

The only way Booker is able to break out of this loop was to realize that he becomes Comstock, and thus allows the multiverse Elizabeths to drown him, ending the pathway that leads to Comstock and closing the loop.

Bioshock asked us if we truly were free to make choices.

*Bioshock Infinite asks us if whether or not the choices we make matter.*

-----

Now Let's Get Meta
-----

    ""He doesn't row?""
          -Robert Lutece
    ""He DOESN'T row.""
          -Rosalind Lutece

 In every timeline, there are Constants, and there are Variables.

* **Constants** are events that will always happen. Booker will always pick #77. Booker will always flip heads. Booker will always lose Anna and hunt down Comstock.

* **Variables** are events that will always be different. Booker will choose between the cage or the bird. Booker will choose to demand tickets or draw his weapon. Booker will choose to kill Slate or spare him. Booker will stun enemies with Shock Jockey or blast 'em to bits with the Volley Gun.

But no matter what choices Booker makes, it always returns to the same constants. Each universe, while infinitely different, will always converge at certain events or choices.

In the same way, every playthrough of Bioshock Infinite mirrors this idea. We will always begin the game at the lighthouse, and we will always end the game at the baptism. But we will always have different experiences with the game because we all will make different choices at each crossroad, and for every choice we make, we also create a reality where a different choice is made.

Let's talk about games where making choices is seen as a huge plus for that game. **The Walking Dead** is a good place. If you guys don't know, this game is *all about choice*. Each decision you make has huge ramifications for the story, and every justification and experience will always be different. However, no matter how many times you play, [you are always asked whether to have Clementine kill you or not](/spoiler). Even in sandbox games like **Grand Theft Auto** or **The Elder Scrolls**, both games boasting player freedom, you are still confined within the same scope, the same choices, but with an infinite amount of player experience.

Bioshock Infinite is the the deconstruction of what a *game* is. It frames our experience with games in a narrative of dimension/time traveling. Each game is forever stuck in a loop, going over the same events, but with each playthrough there will be a different experience.

Let Go Deeper

    ""There's always a lighthouse, there's always a man, there's always a city"" 
          -Elizabeth Comstock

Ok, I explained what a game is, but why did I mention sequels? I must not be very good at this. Let me take a few steps back and define what a sequel is.

A sequel, [as defined by this lovely TvTropes page](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sequel), is a story that takes place after the first story, or, in case of prequels, before. The sequel can continue the story, as seen in Bioshock 2, or it can use the same themes, as seen in Bioshock Infinite.

Bioshock Infinite shares many themes with Bioshock.

* There is a mad dictator (Andrew Ryan and Zachary Comstock)
* There is a perversion of an extreme ideal (Objectivism and Exceptionalism)
* There is an ideal city set to ruins (Rapture and Columbia)
* There is a mechanical guardian you must fight (Big Daddies and Songbird)
* There is a girl you must save (Little Sisters and Elizabeth Comstock)
* There is a lighthouse at which the game begins (Bathysphere and Rocket)
* There is a protagonist who is begins seemingly unrelated but ends up being pivotal in the narrative (Jack Ryan and Booker DeWitt)
* There is a substance that grants powerful abilities (Plasmids and Vigors)
* There is a single, trusty melee weapon (Wrench and Sky Hook)

What is really interesting is that instead of simply having the same themes, Bioshock Infinite uses this idea as part of the plot. Because of the ability to open and observe tears, people like Jeremiah Fink were able to use these tears to peek at other dimensions to create the wondrous technology (used to invent vigors and Songbird). Furthermore, as Elizabeth guides you from Rapture through the infinite lighthouses, she mentions that there are always three constants.

* A Man
* A City
* A Lighthouse

This means that in every timeline ever, these three things always happen. In one timeline, it's Columbia. In another timeline it's Rapture. Like a single game experience, there is an infinite number of possibilities that can occur for any timeline. We can then think of a set of timelines being linked by these themes, thus each set of timelines will feature a different iteration of the themes.

A lot of sequels are exactly this, even ones that are simply continuations of the story.

Every **Final Fantasy** will have Fire-Fira-Firaga and airships. Every **Warcraft** will have Orcs and Humans. Every **Half Life** will have G-Man and Headcrabs. Every **Uncharted** will have fragile ruins and cursed treasures. Every **Monkey Island** will have pirates and monkeys. Every **Grand Theft Auto** will have explosions and gangs. Every **Elder Scrolls** will have exploration and racial issues. We identify a series of games as sequels based on their genre, themes, and mechanics. If a game breaks away from this, it is no longer considered a sequel and is completely considered to be a different game. Thus, not only are the games we played stuck in a loop of choices and events, but also even a series that a game belongs to exists in the same loops of themes and mechanics. 

However, each experience with a game will always be different, thus each playthrough is a different universe, a different possibility amongst the infinite ways that exist.

This is what makes video games a truly amazing medium.

A Final Word
-----

    ""Will the circle be unbroken, by and by, by and by?
     Is a better home awaiting in the sky, in the sky?""
          -Christian hymn

I've played this game twice. Both were completely different experiences, despite the fact the story always stayed the same. In the first playthrough, I spent most of the game scavenging trashcans for Silver Eagles and food. In the second playthrough, I had a tighter focus on gameplay as I quickly decided which weapons and abilities to focus on. What mark will your playthrough leave on the game? Will your DeWitt be a merciless killer, or a leader of change?

We all have the potential to leave our unique mark on a game. All of these possibilities can happen if we would kindly make the choice to play.

Let me just take the chance to say how overwhelmed I am by the responses I'm getting.

Now I don't know if these videos are going to be any good, but I do know that the gaming community needs to move away from this culture of misogyny and denial.  

Saying that either:

1. Games and gaming culture aren't sexist, or
2. Games and gaming culture *are* sexist, but that's ok, or even the way it *should* be (does anyone remember the Capcom reality show debacle?)

is pathetic and is only holding back our ""hobby"" from being both accepted in general, but also from being a truly great art form.  

So, what do you think would make a real change in the gaming community?  I feel like these videos are probably preaching to the choir.  Should the ""charge"" be led by the industry itself or independent game studios?  Should there be more women involved in game design?  What do you think?

I was surprised to see how many people thought this kind of abuse was ok, that women should learn to take a joke, and that games are already totally inclusive, which is to say that they are already equal parts fantasy for men and women.  

I would encourage everyone who cares about great games (via a vibrant gaming industry and gamer culture) to think about whether the games you're playing are really the best they could be, not just in terms of ""is this gun overpowered?"" but in terms of ""does this female character with a huge rack improve the game, or is it just cheap and distracting titillation for men?""",,False,,t5_2sgq6,1339608335.0,,,True,t3_uy2ll,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/uy2ll/try_to_point_out_sexism_in_gaming_get_threatened/,

1372759827.0,411,self.truegaming,1hhll1,Is it actually possible for Half Life 3 to live up to expectations?,Irontheater,701,290,365,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1hhll1/is_it_actually_possible_for_half_life_3_to_live/,"With all the hype that has been circulating on the internet regarding the next installment of Half Life for the last 4-5 years, I come to ask myself if it is really possible for Valve to not disappoint in HL.

Events like this have happened in the past, and one of the more recent ones, I recall Diablo 3, which was a decent game on its own, went on to receive several updates that makes it stand on its own, but is still looked down upon because of the hype that it didn't manage to live up to.

This is not the case of self promotion, and over hyping your own products, it's something that Valve has no control over.

People might recall Bioshock Infinite as being over hyped, but Bioshock 2 was such a disaster, that the next installment was going to be better regardless of how good it would've been. It had just received the ""correct"" amount of hype.

Going back a bit into what made Valve famous for its games, it's the fact that no new game they released was just released to expand their library. Every title they released brought something new to the table:

HL1 was the beginning in-game character depth, story telling, long diversified campaign, general presence of numerous completely different environments, in-game physics, and destructible assets.

Aside from creating a wholly new Game genre, I would call Half Life 1 as being the closest a game can get to ""groundbreaking"" in the FPS genre.

Half Life 2 continued building on that, improving graphics, level design, and adding a new layer of ""freight"" where AI feared you the stronger you became.
I would certainly not call HL2 as revolutionary, but certainly an evolutionary step that set the Gold standard for FPS to come.


Portal 1: It was a risky step. A small game with a handful of levels, just to test out how the game would be perceived. It introduced the notion of thinking outside of the box, not for the players, but for the developers. 
It showed how something radically different from what the market is shoving into peoples' faces could still wind up into a huge win. It also introduced a new mean of exploring, map design, and generally how a player can move throughout a map.


Portal 2, even though at first sight nothing is radically new about this game, and seems as if it consists of Half life storytelling meets Portal game design, it did change something, not visually, not gameplay related, but audibly.

The portal 2 score is leaps and bounds ahead of what could be presented in a modern game, it is by far the most advanced musical depiction I have heard in a game. (in depth explanation: http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/19bhun/an_indepth_analysis_of_the_score_from_portal_2/ )


Now, to come to what is actually possible, and what is expected.

It is possible and feasible that Valve pulls a ""The Last of Us"", they have what it takes. But they will be pounded hard by the community if they do it. That will be ""disappointing"" after all that hype.

They don't need to mimic other good games, they need their own branch of enlightenment.

Is it possible with several new AAA fps games announced every year trying to be the next groundbreaking game, that Valve releases yet a new installment with aspects that everybody missed?
That no one knew needed, yet turns out to be crucial for future development?

I'd like to add another point which *might* constitute a spoiler.
In a recent interview with Gabe Newell, he told journalists how he is trying to tap into the player's emotions and stress levels in order to affect game mechanics.
He gave the example of a game becoming harder, with more enemies and less time the more stressed a player became.

From a functional point of view, this is entirely possible, by mimicking the twitches in a player's movements, or the frequency with which he presses a certain key in game.

This would be a first, afaik.

But I'm suspecting even this wouldn't be sufficient to meet the hype. And that's why I believe the game has not been released yet.

Half Life was always ahead of the curve in every aspect of gaming, paving the way for other to follow.
 They always won awards regarding gameplay and graphics.
That is until HL2EP2.

Or, let's call in HL2EP3. 

Why was it cancelled? Why is it still not released?
My interpretation lies in one game: Crysis.

The graphical advancements which were witness in this game, and the graphical revolution that this game brought hindered every last chance that Valve had for releasing a new installment.

That engine which presented us with beautiful scenery and realistic graphics made Source show its age.
Their newly made engine was beginning to show rust.

With that came the attempt to replenish it with multi core support (2007) and other details, but the CryEngine was a bit too beefy.

I supposed up till this point, HL2EP3 was still in vivid internal testing, amd by 2009 I assume that it came close to completion, starting to take rounds among Game testers, and when prompt with what they thought that game lacked, the response would return in: ""Graphics"".

I really do believe that Valve scraped 2 entire games just because of internal testing responses, and how graphics were exploding. They did it with HL1, they also did it with HL2. 
I believe HL2EP3 and EP4 were to be released, but then scraped. 

Currently, and especially now with the shit storm that Diablo 3 received because of its lacking graphics, Valve simply cannot release an AAA title on Source. It's outdated.
And all game review websites take Graphics into consideration. And consumers are going to be turning the review websites before buying their game.

And that's the mentality behind Source 2.0.
I believe it should come by next year, with L4D3 as the first game.

Why, you might ask? Why not HL3 immediately? 
Valve wants to sense out how the graphics will be perceived by the general audience, if they should tweak a value or add a component.


I definitely did not expect to write that much, but I have a day off today, so I figured I'd give it a bit of my thinking.

[This](http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/06/the-failure-of-bioshock-infinite-writing-games-like-movies/) is an article that was posted on both the aforementioned subreddits and talks about how Bioshock Infinite ""fails"" in that it was ""written like a movie."" There's [a post](http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1h9lcx/very_insightful_article_about_game_stories_thats/) just on the second page that talks about how gaming's strength is not as ""story teller, but story generator.""

I have no problem with a game's story being told cinematically. At all. I understand the viewpoint that an interactive story makes for more freedom for the player and that it's a good way to take advantage of the medium, but in no way see how either format is superior to the other. Saying that all games should be written with a more interactive story seems more like a restriction to me than a freedom (for the developer, not the player). If you've got a great idea for a game's story, you shouldn't try to restructure it just to make it dependent on a character's choice. Just tell it linearly.

I find it absurd that some people say a linear story is ""not true to the medium."" It's as though I were to watch a movie and say ""ridiculous, it should be told as a documentary, not a narrative."" I guess what it boils down to is that some people see a medium as a specialized tool whereas others see an open canvas. (Credit to /u/Downvote_my_account for that excellent analogy.) I'm in the crowd that thinks it's an open canvas, there's no ""correct"" way to tell a story. 

Sure, you might say that The Last of Us or Bioshock Infinite doesn't *need* to be a game, it could be a movie. Okay, fine, let's make it a movie. But wait, it doesn't *need* to be a movie, let's make it a comic book. But wait, it doesn't *need* to be a comic book, let's make it a novel. In my opinion, it's great if a story takes advantage of its medium in a unique way, but whether or not it does is irrelevant. As long as it's still a well-written story and still provides fun gameplay.

So, long story short, why is this such a popular opinion?

Edit: Wow, this blew up quick. Just to clear something up: I am not excusing poor storytelling. To all those who have reminded me that you are against linear stories only when they are done poorly, thank you for the input but that's not what I mean.

I'm not really into hardware and console specs, so I can't comment on that, but 8GB RAM sounds like a lot, and the games looked nice enough.

Overall, the games they did show looked pretty interesting:

Knack: Looks like a fun Ratchet and Clank-y game. Seems like Sony told them to make a game which takes advantages of particle physics, so that's what they've done. I wish Knack looked a bit cuter, but the game still looks quite nice and has some personality.

Killzone: A new Killzone, which is totally a big surprise to everyone. Still, looks fun enough, but I do still think the Helgan are a bit too literally Hitler, and I'd rather them not go around shooting civilians just for fun, because that often takes me out of a game. 

Infamous Second Son: This one came out of the blue and really surprised me. I thought it was WATCH_DOGS for a bit, but then all the super heroes came in and I was pretty surprised. Looks interesting and different, which is always nice.

DRIVECLUB: Looks like a racing game, and has pretty nice graphics and details on the cars. Also, I think the online features with it aren't a bad thing. Quickly going into races with friends looks like a good feature.

WATCH_DOGS: I think we'd all agree this was the best thing on the presentation, and it isn't even an exclusive! Looks like a very interesting game, and I hope what is shown wasn't just a mission, and can procedurally happen in the world.

Final Fantasy Agni's Philosophy: Can't really comment on this one, because my stream played up during it, but I hope it is an FF game where they've learned from the mistakes of FFXIII.

Deep Down: You couldn't really tell how this game will play, as it seemed to be all CGI (or maybe the PS4 is just that good). Looked a bit like a cross between Dark Souls and Monster Hunter, which is pretty cool. I hope they have towns and stuff.

Diablo 3: Now, this one really surprised me. I expected a new IP, or a converted WOW onto consoles, but not Diablo. I suspect it will be much the same as PC versions, but on console (and PS3 by the sounds of things).

Destiny: Forgot this one. The new Bungie MMOFPS. It looks alright, but we didn't really get much footage other than 'look at these big future-ee buildings!'.

----

UI: They've jazzed up the UI a bit, which personally I don't like. I always prefered the simplicity of the PS3 UI, but this seems to be like the Xbox 360 one, but in blue. I guess I'll have to wait and see how it plays.

Sharing: They made a big thing of this, even to go as far as including a 'share' button on the controller. It seems like a nice feature, although I can imagine it leading to an influx of new let's players and videos on Youtube if it lets you physically save the file.

Also interesting, no Valve. After all the effort they went to at last E3 to say 'Look! Portal 2 and Cloud gaming and VALVE!' I'm surprised they didn't make an appearance. ",,False,,t5_2sgq6,1361409834.0,,,True,t3_18x8tc,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/18x8tc/thoughts_on_the_ps4/,
1363375689.0,404,self.truegaming,1ad85s,Character-based storytelling is impossible in a game that offers real choice to the player,ariel_darius,553,149,211,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1ad85s/characterbased_storytelling_is_impossible_in_a/,"This is just a theory I came up with it, and I'd like offer it up here for you all to consider, accept, reject, poke holes in, or just generally ridicule. I apologize if this is an old debate that's already been hashed over. I just came up with the idea recently and thought I'd write it out.

So, my thesis is ""Character-based storytelling is impossible in a game that offers real choice to the player."" Now I will try to make an argument for it.

If you look for advice on how to write a screenplay or novel, one of the things you'll often hear is that your main character needs to have 'agency'. Open any of those ""How to Write a Screenplay"" books, and you'll see this advice over and over, and I think it's good advice. So what does 'agency' mean in this context? It means that your character needs to make decisions which are crucial to the plot. They can't just be ""on a ride"" where all their decisions are ineffectual. No matter how exciting the events around the character are, your plot cannot be considered ""character-based"" if the character's psychology isn't affecting the plot.

The reason why agency is important is because a character's true personality is best revealed through the decisions they make. It's the interaction between the character's psychology and the world around them that best demonstrates to the audience who the character really is. As the old saying goes, ""People are what they do."" If you want to do character-based storytelling, it's not enough to simply invent complex, realistic characters and describe their psychology to the audience. You have show the audience the character's psychology by forcing them to make important choices.

The whole point of character-based storytelling is to show how the character attempts to extert their will on the outside world. This is why conflict is so important to storytelling. It doesn't just make things more interesting. It reveals the character more fully by forcing the character out of their comfort zone and forcing them to make decisions that are surprising.

Look at good screenplays and you'll find tons of examples of characters making tough decisions that affect the plot and reveal more about the character. For example, (widely known spoilers for Raiders of the Lost Ark, Casablanca and Empire Strikes Back ahead) [when Indiana Jones puts down the rocket launcher and chooses to not destroy the ark, or when Rick chooses to help Ilsa and her husband out of Casablanca, or when Luke Skywalker decides to confront Vader despite being warned that he is not ready.](/spoiler) All of these choices are interesting not just because they're tough choices, but because they expose the core of the character in a way that couldn't be done without forcing the character to make a real choice with real consequences.

In gaming, however, it's the players who want to make real choices with real consequences. They don't just want to shoot the bad guys and pick up the goodies. They want to make choices that affect the entire plot. If they aren't allowed to do this, they get the feeling that they are ""on rails"" and just walking through a script. But allowing the gamer to make important choices for the protagonist is in fundamental conflict with the basic principle of character-based storytelling. A character's choices should be based on the character's psychology, not the choices of the gamer. If you give the gamer real choice, you destroy the integrity of the character. The character becomes just a collection of ineffectual psychological attributes which have no effect on the events around them. And that is generally the hallmark of bad storytelling.

So how do you do character-based storytelling in a game that offers a plot dependent on player choice? I don't know. I do know that you can still develop the personalities of NPCs. They aren't harmed by the player making choices. But how do you give the player real choice over the protagonist's actions? I don't think you can.

I also don't think more than 2 people read all the way through this, but oh well. Thanks, both of you.

tl;dr The problem with character-based storytelling in games is one of agency. If you give agency to the player, you take it away from the character.

My favorite is this:

Halo 2. I was the bomb carrier in the last couple of minutes of an Assault match in Headlong. We decided to bring the bomb in from the top of the building with a single wingman while the rest of our team ran weapon control/distraction on the lower route. I made it across the bridge into the building containing the objective, but my wingman did not. The timer was getting low, so I decided it was up to me to give it one last push. I knew from my limited experience with our opponents that they were skilled with the weapons, but horrible at working as a team. I could tell they were close by, because I could hear them chatting to each other on the proximity chat, so I keyed the mic and shouted, ""BOMB'S COMING IN DOWN BELOW!"" Miraculously, my ruse worked, and every single one of them jumped off the ramps into the bottom level, leaving me alone to plant the bomb at the objective.

Even though it's a good system, it just doesn't have the library to support it.  But if we look to the future, we get Pikmin 3, Wonderful 101, etc.   The future looks bright.

This harkens back to the 3DS, the launch selection was pretty bad.  But now, it's the most sold console ever with an amazing selection of games and even more amazing games to come (cough, pokemon, cough).

So my question is, should Nintendo have delayed the Wii U for, say a year, knowing that the library in that first year wasn't going to be great.  Has this first mediocre Wii U year hurt the system more than helped?

Edit: Here seem to be the major talking points:

* The hardware doesn't compare to the PS4 or Xbox One and so, if delayed for a year, would have looked rather outdated.  This is a valid point however the Wii was outdated compared to the PS3 and the 360.

* The release was very purposefully timed/many consoles have poor release selections.  More good points.

* A delay would have helped consolidate a lineup and provide better advertising.

Also a number of people seem to desire to answer their own questions.

I think the unanimous agreement was the vast majority of games have terrible stories and even the best of the best (BioShock Infinite, Planescape Torment) were only comparable to b-lister novels (i.e. no game has come close to even good novels in terms of story). I tend to agree, with games like Mass Effect considered the pinnacle of game storytelling, would be an average-at-best sci-fi novel.

But as we all know, games are an entirely different medium from film or novels. My question is: can you think of any games that have told a story well through GAMEPLAY alone, that could otherwise not be told in the other mediums? By gameplay I mean the player actively engaging in the story, without the use of heavy cut scenes or QTEs (glorified cut scenes). Games like Heavy Rain don't count, which was essentially a movie.

The best example I can think of is Journey, which told it's story silently through in-game actions done by the character and game environment. The interaction between players made the story unique and would be impossible to replicate in other mediums.

EDIT3: I can't question. I was pointed out, rightfully so, as being a [No true Scotsman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman); an informal fallacy of changing criteria when a counterexample is revealed against a universal claim. No one's perfect and I recognize my question is not perfect, so **interpret the question as you will and have fun discussing! Please remain civil!**

EDIT4: This thread is starting to get big and I'm glad. Don't see many discussions on story these days amidst the new console hype. If I miss any PM me; So far the games I'm seeing mentioned the most are:

1374716472.0,396,self.truegaming,1izyi8,Character analysis of Emile from Halo: Reach,Dubhe14,550,154,146,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1izyi8/character_analysis_of_emile_from_halo_reach/,"Hi /truegaming.  I was explaining this to a friend recently, and he told me to share it here.  Reach was a while ago, but hopefully you'll like what I have to say.  This contains MASSIVE spoilers for Halo: Reach, so I'll warn you now instead of blacking out most of my post.

Halo: Reach follows the story of Noble Team as they live out the fall of the planet Reach from the Covenant invasion.  Despite the few problems I have with its story (another time, maybe), Reach is one of my favorite games of all time, mostly due to the incredible individuality and depth written into each member of Noble Team.  Well, every member, it seems, except Emile.  Emile sticks out, doesn't he?  A lot of people regard him as the least well-written Spartan, and they're pretty justified in saying so.  He's a walking museum of ""badass"" stereotypes: big-ass knife, skull carved into his helmet, belts of grenades strapped to his red and grey armor, constantly cracking off-color jokes - At first glance, he doesn't seem to have much personality aside from ""I am the token bad boy in this team.""  And while I see why some people would believe this, I believe he is the most human, and indeed the most relatable of the Nobles.

The first time the player encounters Emile, he is [sharpening a knife on his bicep](http://youtu.be/_OHvjCVbRa4?t=2m12s).  Go back and reread that sentence.  You're probably wondering how such a caricature could ever be relatable, and I don't blame you.  After all, he keeps this attitude up throughout the whole game:

""Command will not be keeping us company on this trip."" [""I'm lonely already.""](http://youtu.be/_OHvjCVbRa4?t=4m21s)

""She needs a full psychiatric work up."" [""She's not the only one.""](http://youtu.be/_OHvjCVbRa4?t=8m20s)

""May I [borrow your knife]?"" [""Don't cut yourself.""](http://youtu.be/5gVAn-SwRSA?t=7m43s)

[""It's a regular family reunion.""](http://youtu.be/g9rFbvM_XsE?t=7m36s)

Along with some more quips during actual gameplay.

So why all this?  Why the attitude, the macho symbolism, why is Emile the only Spartan to never take his helmet off?  My theory is that it's all a mask for a major insecurity.

I believe Emile is afraid of dying.

This is why he hides behind the skull and knife, why he's the only Noble who never says anything positive to 6, why he always makes light of other people's deaths.  During the story, there are two major deaths Emile makes jokes about: the scientist in the first mission - he chides Jorge for caring about the dead man's daughter - and the death of Jorge himself - [""The big man was sentimental.""](http://youtu.be/g9rFbvM_XsE?t=7m52s).  What's interesting to note is that both these deaths happen off-screen for Emile.

What's *very* interesting to note is that that joke about Jorge is the last malicious joke he says in the game.  After Kat dies - in front of him, mind you - his attitude changes and you don't hear him make light of anyone's death again.  You see, up until this point, Emile had no reason to believe that Spartans weren't immortal.  After all, there are no Spartans KIA, and he had yet to see one die (I understand we don't know anything about the previous Noble 6, but if [this trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKRlWLDWhGI) is canon, then Emile didn't see him die either).  When he witnessed Kat die in front of him, Emile came face to face with his own mortality, with the realization that not even his intimidating helmet could protect him from a stray bullet.

Watch [this scene](http://youtu.be/g9rFbvM_XsE?t=10m54s). From the 11:15 mark, look at everyone's position.  Jun is lighting a flare, Carter is carrying Kat's body, 6 is beside Jun looking around.  Look at Emile.  His arms are at his sides, completely passive.  He's separated from the rest of the team physically and figuratively.  Carter Jun and 6 are illuminated from the front, while Emile, still inside the wreckage, is illuminated from behind..  The BLUE flare heralds their escape out the city, and the continuation of the story, it represents the resilience of the Spartans and their determination to keep fighting for the planet.  Emile is bathed in RED.  This image is my favorite moment in the game, and I think it's truly beautiful the way it subtly conveys how Emile feels right then.

Emile's personality changes after that.  Right before [Carter's death](http://youtu.be/LY_4Y9GC-tM?t=7m12s), he acts uncharacteristically noble, one could almost describe him as ""reassuring"".  After Carter dies, Emile carries on: ""Crevice to the east.  Let's go.""  By the end of the game, Emile has come to accept his mortality and the inevitability of his death.  Giving his life to ensure safe passage for the Pillar of Autumn, his last words are 

[""I'm ready! How 'bout you?""](http://youtu.be/LY_4Y9GC-tM?t=8m36s)

Is Emile a product of brilliant writing, or a lazy character who accidentally turns deep if you look too far between the lines?  I can't say, and I've had people tell me I'm over analyzing the hell out of this character, but I like my Emile.  After connecting the dots, he went from the token bad boy to a tragic persona: afraid of dying and cursed with being witness to the deaths of his teammates, he overcomes his fear and faces his death like a true hero.

So /truegaming, do you agree with my theory, or am I pulling shit out of my ass.  Have you encountered a similar ""shallow but deep if you look hard enough"" character in your gaming experience?  I welcome the discussion.  Thanks for indulging my theory!

I'm getting older.

Granted, I'm only 25, but I'm aging at the rate of one year per year, and throughout most of those years, there have been games.  Back when I was 3, my mum would sometimes set up the ZX Spectrum and point out what the buttons did.  She'd put in the cassette, type LOAD """", and create a character for me in Barry McGuigan's Boxing.  He'd have blond hair, of course, and he'd be called Ryan.  Look, it was even caught on camera:

http://i.imgur.com/4IxqZ.jpg

I've been in this game a long time, man.  I thought I knew more about video games than anyone else could.  They were my kingdom.

The internet completely destroyed that notion.  I'm still sifting through the wreckage.  Sometimes I'll uncover forgotten truths on why I loved video games in the comments section, on the obscure blog.  Sometimes I'll find things that challenge my understanding of what a game is, or should be.  But mostly I just come across the same points and ideas being expressed at every turn, usually regarding recent releases.

One of these, however, is curiously persistent.  It's never a big story, but it surfaces with quiet regularity.  Maybe it's an image macro about the number of unplayed games in a Steam account.  Maybe it's a rage comic about having none of the games and all of the time.  It could be as subtle as a thread about game suggestions.  The subject line that always strikes the deepest chord with me, however, usually looks something like this:

""Getting kind of bored of games.  Any ideas how to get out of this rut?""

My older brother (whom I love dearly, because I know he'll be secretly reading this) has played a ton of video games too.  It was his passion first, but he always seemed so much more critical of them than I was.  So many of them seemed so pointless to him.  He would lose entire days to Knights of the Old Republic with an endurance that would match any neckbeard at his battlestation, but he wouldn't give Meteos 5 minutes.  He always seemed at once in the thrall of the experience and maddeningly unsatisfied with games generally.  When I see someone with enough passion for the medium to have be subscribed to truegaming say they're getting bored, it's hard for me to not see my brother seated at his desk, quietly complaining that KOTOR2 isn't a patch on the first one (reference intended).

I've felt it myself.  I've went through long periods of not playing anything.  But it's only since coming to Reddit that I've felt bad about that.  People are always talking about those great moments.  That feeling.  That little kid in your head that was screaming ""THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER"".  I think back on all those times for me.  Meeting the Butcher.  Overhearing NSF guards talk about Paul.  The Return Fire demo on the Windows 95 disc.  I started thinking about all these times, and came to a sad realisation - I haven't had one of those moments in a long, long time.  Maybe you haven't either.

There is nothing wrong with that.

Seriously.

Don't beat yourself up about it.  It's generally accepted that you don't get lost in books the way you do when you're very young, but our generation doesn't know any different.  We haven't grown up in a world without video games.  They were there throughout all of our childhood, helping us in their rudimentary fashion to understand the world around us, and as a result, we haven't yet become accustomed to this feeling of boredom.  Not every bookworm remains one, not every kid who loved Michael Jackson became a music critic.  Games were a thing we definitely loved when we were kids.  If we don't feel we love them in that way any more, does that mean we're no longer kids?  Are we getting older?

This nagging feeling of despair that appears in 'rut' posts seems to me to be a basic problem of self-expression.  What we're really saying is ""Why don't games seem as exciting to me any more, and what does that mean for me?""

Let me level with you.  Those awesome feelings?  They're never coming back.  They're gone.  Forever.  You will never be as happy playing games as you were when you were a kid.  People will blame this on changing industry trends, sloppy game design and lazy developers, but the honest truth is that a game could be the most well-designed, perfectly-written, fun-as-balls piece of software ever conceived, and it still won't match that feeling of childhood elation when you finally beat Diablo.  In other words, it's not worth your attention or emotional investment in pursuit of that experience, because you're no longer an empty vessel.  You're a human being.  You have knowledge, and you have learned things, and this will influence how you perceive art.  Former drug addicts sometimes say they were constantly chasing that first session, constantly hoping the next would be as good as that first, pure experience when they had no idea what was coming next.  I sometimes wonder why that image resonates so strongly regarding how I feel when I load up a new game for the first time.  I want it to be like it was when I was a kid, yet I find myself blaming the game for the fact that I'm not a kid any more.

So what's the upside?

Well, for a start, it means you have developed taste.  You're no longer willing to be pandered to.  Video games are something you don't fuck around with any more, because every time you do, they come up short.  If you play a game for more than half an hour and it's still boring as shit, you have the freedom to switch it off and do something more fun.  It doesn't make you a bad gamer.  And it most certainly doesn't mean those who really enjoyed it are worse gamers than you.  It means it wasn't for you, and you're not going to waste your time playing it.  You've got more important shit to do.  You know which games you like now, and have a more discerning eye.  You can afford to take your time, because you know games will always be there.  You can take a break, wait for some new stuff to come out, idly check through it and see if anything catches your fancy.  You don't see the hype any more.  You don't get taken in by the wild promises that can't possibly be delivered on, because you've played enough RPGs to know what they're realistically capable of at this point.  Ever notice how AAA titles are always marketed as ""the game you've been waiting for""?  They're basically saying that this game will be the game you've wanted to play your entire life, that it'll give you the same joy the games of the past did.  You know now that's bullshit.  It's simply not possible , but we want to believe it.  And because you won't get your kicks from blockbuster titles any more, you'll start looking in other places.  Maybe a genre you've never tried before, or in the modern indie scene, and you might find that while you don't have that childhood joy, you do have a deeper, quieter appreciation for what's being done because those creators are influenced by that very same childhood joy.

In short, if you're afraid you're growing out of games, don't worry.  You've just moved past the 'accepting everything that's thrown at me' phase of passion.  You can adapt games into your lifestyle at your chosen pace, not the industry's.  Keep your chin up, and your eyes forward.  To the future.

I find steam an incredibly convenient service, especially for someone as disorganized as myself. Instead of losing my physical game disks or game files in my cluttered start menu, Steam keeps my collection easily accessible and organized. 

However, that said, what worries me about Steam is that I don't own the games I have on there. What I have is essentially indefinite season passes to play the games, which can be revoked or nullified at any time. If my credit card information goes awry or valve goes under and shutters the service-- the several hundred dollars I've spent in steam is awash. 

I fear that --especially with fast changing digital realm-- in a couple of decades that Valve will end up with some crappy management, cease to be innovative and go under-- shuttering Steam and preventing me booting up my steam version of Hitman: Blood Money like I can with my  SNES cartridge of Link to the Past today. 

So r/truegaming, does that possibility ever bother you? Does it affect how you spend money on steam (i.e. only purchase games on sale)? Are you on a lookout for a similar service that provides a similar level of convenience while giving you greater ownership/control of game titles you've spent money on?

1364972771.0,382,self.truegaming,1bkp4p,Would a game that tracks subtle and subconscious choices by the player be possible and enjoyable?,spupy,479,97,113,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1bkp4p/would_a_game_that_tracks_subtle_and_subconscious/,"First the situation that led me to this question.  
Last night I started playing Bioshock, the first one (no spoilers). I went into the game knowing absolutely nothing apart from being underwater, there's shooting with guns, some kind of psionic abilities, and how big daddies and little sister look like.  
Right at the start of the game, before visiting the city of Rapture, you're in sort of a building. You need to get to the floor below the entrance, there are two sets of stairs - left and right. At each staircase there's a metal plaque with an image and a single word - ""science"" on the left and ""art"" on the right staircase. Those were purely for decoration.   
At first I didn't notice the words, since I was still marveling at the graphics and the Art Deco style. But what if *did* see the signs and it influenced a subconscious decision on which staircase to take? What if my choice actually had an influence on how the story is presented or plays out?  

Another scenario I thought up (not from the game). You open a small room to find a dead end, but there are some supplies - a medpack and a case of gun ammo. Depending on which one you go to and take first, the game changes subtly for the next level.  

Let me try to state the problem in a more straightforward way. Do choices/questions in games need to be **explicitly** presented to the player? Does the player always need to know that he is influencing the game?  

An explicitly presented choice (e.g. a dialogue choice) allows the player to roleplay - play the game as a character (role) that he made up. But in the two examples above the choices are made by the player and not by the chosen role. For this reason, should such a game exist, it must consist of entirely one type of decision-making (""explicit"" vs ""subtle""), to prevent mixing of ""player's character"" and the player him/herself.  

Has any of you encountered such a mechanism in a game? Did you find it enjoyable? Did you notice that the game is ""watching"" you? Would such a game be plausible and enjoyable?

Often it is disregarded as a 'kiddified' version of the immensely well-loved Final Fantasy Tactics.

I loved it from the moment I encountered it, both from the art style to the battle system and game world.  But I think the game deserves some enduring attention for the way it brilliantly handled one of the most-commonly discussed topics in the gaming community: 'What if you could really live in a video game world?""

The story is simple, a bunch of somewhat-downtrodden schoolkids find themselves transported into the world of Ivalice through a magical book.  They are separated and scattered, and as we guide our hero Marche's steps in this strange new world, we soon find that his friends have made new lives for themselves and do not all share his assumption that they should return to the real world.

Marche's younger brother Doned, crippled by an unspecified illness in the real world, is now a healthy, sprightly thief.  Their friend Ritz, a seemingly confident girl who hides a shame of her albino white-hair, is now a silken red-head and leader of a powerful Vieira clan.  Finally Mewt, a shy, bullied boy who has lost his mother, is now the de facto ruler of Ivalice, and his mother is alive as Queen.

All of Marche's friends have found something in the fantasy world that has eclipsed their particular issues and anxieties in the real world.  More so, they are not just schoolkids any more, they are players in the great game of Clans, powerful and respected figures.  Only Marche, although able to enjoy the wonder and opportunity of Ivalice, seems inclined to persuade his friends that for all this world offers, its fundamental unreality and fantasy are no substitute for the real world.  The game does a great job of making you question this fundamental goal of the hero versus the decisions of his friends and the temptation of the fantasy world.  The traditional good vs evil RPG setup takes a backseat to a more psychological play in which we do not simply guide a hero to victory over an unquestionable evil, but in which we have to convince our friends and family what is best for them, while struggling with the same question ourselves.

Without getting spoilerific, I'll simply say that I think Marche's journey to return to the real world, and to convince his friends that they should do likewise, is extremely well written and plotted.  It is very  easy to empathise with each of the character's viewpoints, and you wonder time and again if you could tear yourself away from a similar fantasy world.  That said, in its denouement, FFTA makes a good, positive case that by exploring other worlds and other personalities in fantasy (or by implication, video games) we can grow as people and confront and overcome our real world problems.

The sequel, Grimoire of the Rift, traded a somewhat improved game system for a massively diminished version of the story, with an emotional-baggage-free hero and a general incentive to go play at your leisure in Ivalice.  But I think the original certainly deserves a re-look by the modern audience for its intelligent and sympathetic treatment of a question that transcends video games.",,False,,t5_2sgq6,False,,,True,t3_166mdp,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/166mdp/why_i_think_final_fantasy_tactics_advance/,

We would discuss which aspect of the game are interesting and which are not, what in the game world reinforces the narrative, or what in the game mechanics highlights the game's themes.**

The r/truegaming community would select which games we would look into in the following weeks once a month, and I would then announce what those games would be once a month and maybe remind people once a week. People would then have time to replay through the game if they felt it was necessary to remember certain things, and those who had not played it and wanted to join in would have a chance to do so. Although I in no way believe we should discourage those who have not played the game from participating in the discussion as long as they do so in a constructive and interesting way.

I could also provide at the beginning of the week some articles related to the game or some of the mechanics of the game at the beginning of the week, to give people ideas of what are some interesting things to discuss. I am a little unsure of this as I fear it may homogenize opinion, and so I would love to hear some opinions on this. Furthermore we could have a specific theme selected for the entire month so that we chose games that had something in common like a specific mechanic or genre, and at the end of the month we could have a really good discussion about said theme. However this is also something I would love to hear opinions on.

I don't how many or if anyone here would be interested in doing this, but if so I am more than willing to run this discussion on a weekly basis.

I've noticed one thing that really makes the TV series and movies that lacks in the games... a combination of adventure and mystery.


When I say adventure, I'm going to use Skyrim as an example, there is quite a bit land to travel in but... it's mostly the same thing over and over when you do find a place of interest. A place filled with enemies. I think back when DayZ first came out, that's what I'd like to see in an RPG, multiplayer or not. A game the player can get literally lost in, however, when do you manage to find and item or area it's a massive sense of accomplishment. 


I personally would like to see this built upon in an RPG. Where magic is a complete mystery and an adventure in itself to obtain even a single spell. Extremely rare items that completely change you and the world around. Large landscapes that don't necessarily have a cave, fortress, or cookie cutter temple placed everywhere. Instead have less places that are truly fleshed out that completely immerse the player.

Compare average screenshots from [Oblivion and Skyrim](http://download.gameblog.fr/images/blogs/3194/48858.jpg) both games designed for the same consoles yet look a generation apart.

But consider the gap in the physics in both of the games was far less impressive, landscapes remaining unmalleable, objects indestructable, and NPCs relatively unphased by impacts and environments until killed and reduced to an unimpressive rag doll.

The same is true throughout the current generation, even games which tout their physics systems are none too impressive, usually using some predesignated animated for objects to be destroyed when triggered rather than real virtual destruction.

So I ask what is there to expect and hope for in the next few years in the realm of game graphics, will we get closer to our childhood dream of toppling towers, burning down villages and characters which truely react to the situations they are put in.

Here's some tips",indiefellow,546,167,142,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1dcwyc/going_through_a_gaming_slump_heres_some_tips/,"Hey guys, I'm just posting this thread because I've recently been able to get out my gaming slump or ""gaming depression"" as I call it. It was kind of crappy, mostly because I really wanted to play games, but I just didn't have the motivation to, or.. A larger part of me didn't want to play games so much as watch **Let's Plays** or **live streams** of them.

But, I ended up getting through it, and I'm way happier with it now.. So here's a few tips.

* **Get out of your habits.**

    * Stop doing things just because you've always done them. You know that youtuber you always watch the new videos of? Stop doing it just because you always have. Oftentimes we force ourselves to watch videos even if we don't necessarily feel like it, but just because every time we get home from school/work it's almost ritual to.

* **Do what you want to do.**

   * This probably seems obvious, but I was struck by how often I did something even when I didn't really *want* to do it. I'd log onto WoW and just run around even if I wasn't feeling up for it, or because I felt like I owed to my guild mates or something. Do you want to play League of Legends? Play it. You don't have to finish that thing in Minecraft or finish that Civ game first - just do what you want to do.


* **Find some new gaming buds.**

    * You don't even need to go outside for this one! Just post on one of reddit's awesome subreddits, go to 4chan's /v or /vg's Steam threads (there's TONS of them!). It's amazing how much more fun gaming with someone who you can talk to while the game is going on or after the game.  


* **It's okay to take a break.**

   * Don't feel like you have to keep trying to play games if you don't want to. Stop watching gaming vids, maybe just try and pick up a new hobby. At some point you'll likely get an itch to play some game. Keep holding off until you literally can't wait to play a game and hype it up in your head!

* **Time limits and goals**

   * What I mean by this is that you should stop playing games for 8-10 hours a day. Sit down and limit yourself to 3-4 hours a day if you're losing interest in games but can't stop playing. You'll find that you'll really value the 3-4 hours you set for yourself to play games. You'll start setting goals, getting things done, and you'll look forward to tomorrow when you can do the things you didn't have time to do the day before.

____

A lot of this seems obvious, but it really helped me when I actively tried to do all of these things. It's amazing how often we make it hard on ourselves and don't do what we want.

 So the GTX 780 is now out. A £550 card. Likely more expensive than an *entire* next gen console and it is just one component. And it has 3GB GDDR5. It is architecturally very similar to the Titan, which carries 6GB GDDR5.

 With the knowledge of next gen console games looming, why aren't they future proofing these cards? Even if they only expect the 780 to have a years shelf life, that still takes it into (console) next gen territory. A £550 card that might struggle in any one particular element of graphics processing come next gen consoles just seems like a massive waste of money to me. 

**EDIT** - To clarify, I am just looking at the 780 here, as it is new and only carries 3GB. I would assume the 6GB on a titan will be somewhat on the money.

Also, as perspective, my friend recently bought a GTX 670 with 4GB. An older card with an entire gig more GDDR5 than this new GTX 780 beast that is supposed to be only just under the performance of a titan.

**SECOND EDIT** - Thanks for the responses. Everyone seems very sure the sheer power of the GPU will carry it through anything next gen can throw at it. Maybe my confusion comes from the websites I read. I am constantly seeing current GDDR5 on graphics cards being labelled a potential hazard when next gen consoles hit. Here is an example from Eurogmer, posted only today ([comparing the GTX 780 to the Titan](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-nvidia-geforce-gtx-780-review)) :

&gt;The biggest cutback comes from the GDDR5 allocation - it's 6GB on Titan, and 3GB on the GTX 780. In our testing we found that this made no difference at all, but as next-gen kicks in, RAM allocation may well become more important.

 This isn't the first time or the first place I have seen this highlighted as a potential issue, which led me to my question. 

 I was also under the impression standard DDR3 RAM in PC's was not heavily used in gaming? Needed, but not a key factor when determining graphical fidelity.

  This could be wrong however! As I said, I am already admitting I don't know, that's why I am asking about it :)",,False,,t5_2sgq6,1370106115.0,,,True,t3_1fgjzl,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1fgjzl/why_arent_graphics_cards_increasing_their_gddr5/,

Points TotalBiscut makes:

**Music**  

* Multiple recurring revenue streams  
* Royalties - Pandora, Spotify, Radio Play  
* Concerts and live shows  
* Merchandise  
* CD sales aren't that relevant, more of a marketing tool  
* No cost to Studio once music is released  

**Movies**  

* Similar to music  
* Most of the time money made back entirely at the box office  
* DVD/Blu Ray  
* Rental  
* Royalties - On Demand, Amazon/Netflix/Hulu  
* TV Syndication  
* No cost to Studio once movie is released  

**Used Car**  

* Inherent Risk  
* Wear and tear  
* Degradation of performance and safety  
* No post-purchase cost for manufacturer  
* Not a luxury item  
* *OP* I'd personally like to add a point here, car manufacturers have recurring revenue streams through OEM part sales on vehicle maintenance. Take that as you will.  

**Video Games**   

* Stores push used over new - Making massive profit margins  
* Often have to go to specialized stores for used CDs/DVDs. Used games in mainstream stores  
* Good as New, no wear and tear (resurfacing)  
* Post purchase upkeep by Devs/Publishers (servers, patches, customer support)  
* Used Sales keep multiplayer communities alive for users, but the associated costs aren't being equitably repaid  
* Online Pass/DLC used to monetize used copies  
* Microsoft's policy isn't necessarily anti-consumer. They are aimed at Gamestop, not at consumer, but consumer is still affected.  
* Retailers have been bullying Devs/Publishers for years into pre-order exclusives, price fixing (forcing digital prices to stay equal to retailer see: base prices on Steam, PSN, eShop)  
* Policies are looking to diversify revenue streams much like movies or music  

**Comparisons to the PC Market**  

* Used games essentially don't exist anymore. You buy digital or retail, both generally activate to services online  
* Buying an old game, just digital codes (see: GOG, Steam, etc)  
* The result is more money going directly to Devs/Publishers, resulting in ridiculously low sales prices  
* Even new games are affected like this, seeing massive discounts  

**Random**  

* People who sell their used games are able to purchase more games as a result of that   
* Concedes the point, but goes on to say that most people who do that will only stay in the used ecosystem in order to save more money  
* Publishers see high profit margins for DLC  
* One player buys DLC, trades copy in, DLC stays on account. Then next player is forced to buy the DLC again  
* No used titles in the future, going to an all digital market. Examples: iOS, Steam, Books, music, etc.  
* Very strange for Microsoft to take the negative PR now since we have a digital future  
* Fallacy where shutting down used games will cause more expensive games. Source: Steam

The game already forced this in certain ways (some enemies did have night vision, blocked your detective vision, destroyed rafters, etc.).  However, what I'm describing would be more procedurally generated.  It would force you to learn and master new moves all the time instead of relying on a few overpowered moves in 90% of situations.

Enemies should only remember your top two or three moves, so they would eventually forget your old moves and you could go back to using freeze grenades after using batarangs for a while.  It would also be a learning experience for you since you can't just look at an enemy and go ""oh, he's weak to cape stun.""  You would have to test it and see what they know/don't know about you.

Dishonored is short for a AAA game (unless you spend a lot of time reading everything, collecting every rune, and even then). The thing about this is that I think this fits the game. In a game like Dishonored where the environment is so tied into gameplay every square foot of a building needs attention from the level designers. I feel like adding more time to this game would have detracted from the overall quality. We'd see filler content that is there simply to extend play time.

Hours is a terrible way to measure game content. If we measured games by hour MMOs would win every time. Let's stop using it.",,False,,t5_2sgq6,False,,,True,t3_11lqgh,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/11lqgh/the_hour_problem/,

I've been playing a lot of indie RPG Maker games lately, and I've been having a lot more fun with that than most of the big budget AAA games that have been coming out this past few years. Are turn based games really dead in the mainstream? The only ones that are made today are put on handhelds, or are so obscure that they don't even make it to the West. It really feels like an unexplored genre. There's so much you can do with the magical addition of ""turns."" Think of Chess, Golf, Baseball. All turn based, and for a good reason. They give the game ""structure"", it's what makes it a ""game."" If Baseball didn't have turns it would just be a bunch of people running around the field like retards. Chess would just be two kids using the pieces as action figures. You can make some really complex systems requiring a lot of strategy and pre-planning, which is a lot more fun and ""gamey"" to me than some epic action system.

Also, I've noticed Turn based games seem ideal to developing a party of characters, because AI still is ass in our modern day, and being able to give commands to each character makes them all equally as playable and easier to get attached to because I feel like they're having a tangible effect on the game.

1355725025.0,368,self.truegaming,14zcxx,"I miss cheating. Achievement, Progress, and the death of the Gameshark have destroyed fun..",tetsuo9000,771,403,403,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/14zcxx/i_miss_cheating_achievement_progress_and_the/,"TLDR: Sorry for this rant. I'm holding back years of frustrations and I'm just spewing it out at this point. Basically the emphasis on pure saves and achievments has downplayed cheating. With the death of the gameshark, you can't break console games and there's a lot of fun that can't be had anymore. I think this sucks. I want to know if I'm alone in thinking this. If you want this sentiment in rant from, read away. 

To begin with, I find current gen titles exhausting. Thank Freeman for the modding community spicing it up on the PC side of things (the experience one can have with Dead Rising 2, Skyrim, etc. in comparison to their console counterparts is completely different). In most AAA titles nowadays, there's so much bland emphasis on developing skills and unlocking ""weapons"" with each title having its own three hour tutorial where gameplay elements are unlocked (Assassin's Creed being a good example). I yearn for the olden days where I could skip all of that. Here's what I think: I honestly don't want to ""play"" Just Cause 2 the same way the developers intended. I think it's a substandard game with a terrible plot and ""progressing"" through it is beyond a chore. In previous generations of gaming, I could make due however and bypass the bullshit by cheating. Infinite health, money, ammo, etc. Unlocking all weapons, characters, zones, items, etc. The gameshark was my best friend. An example of said cheating? I made it through Final Fantasy X by throwing my infinite wallet of money at bosses via the spare change skill.

I have a confession to make. I never actually beat Ocarina of Time in the normal fashion until a few years ago. When I was younger, I enjoyed breaking the game. Using a ""Press L to levitate"" cheat via Gameshark and unlocking all items, I soared through the game... literally. I made it through the water temple without going through half the rooms by levitating everywhere. It was fun to turn the challenge sideways. 

Games these days take themselves too seriously. I think Rockstar adding cheats to Red Dead Redemption but disabling the ability to save when cheats are used is extremely telling to what this generation of gaming stands for. Gameplay has to be pure. A playthrough can't count if a person saves after cheating because it'd ruin the achievment scheme. Grand Theft Auto was a shining example of where I would play for a few hours, get tired of playing through the story, and just start using cheat codes to break the game and unwind. 

So what does this have to do with achievements? Did you know it takes *three* playthroughs to unlock every achievement/trophy in the critical failure, Shadows of the Damned? *Every* difficulty must be played through to get platinum. That's the type of shit I hate. Achievements **were** neat. They were fun. I enjoyed getting rewarded for completing a feat of gameplay. It has become beyond tedious however because most games don't have feats worth beating or developers don't seem to understand what an interesting feat is. People motivated themselves to do highest difficulty full-sneak playthroughs of Metal Gear Solid without achievements. Anti-cheating has become the norm. Tying progress to the game and keeping saves sacred, pure, and untainted of cheating so as to have achievements universal has made gaming tedious to me. I miss cheating. I wish current games had cheats. I wish I could save with cheats.  

Imagine restarting Assassin's Creed 3 with everything unlocked and just going to town or pressing a button and Conner levitates, allowing air-to-ground executions to be possible without climbing a roof or a tree. Think of how much better substandard shooters with somewhat unique ideas like Dark Sector would have been if you could just break the game (FYI for the people who didn't play Dark Sector: you get cool abilities 2/3 of the way through the game... if you can stomach getting that far). My girlfriend will never be able to beat Dark Souls... but she could if her character had max stats. I hate having to do the chores in Assassin's Creed. I hate that there's no fun elements or stupid unlockables via cheat codes like big head mode in Goldeneye. I want Spiderman-on-a-skateboard levels of stupid awesomeness a la Tony Hawk in the current AAA titles. It certainly adds to the replay value for me. Cheats are entertaining. I miss them. I'll guess I'll end this on one last note. A moment of silence for the Gameshark, the Game Genie, the Action Replay, etc. and what they allowed gamers to achieve.

",awchern,487,122,158,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/11enqs/identity_in_gaming_or_why_final_fantasy_ix_is/,"[This is going to be a long analysis of an old game, so if you don't want to read, then that's fine. It's just my thoughts on the game. Oh, and there are spoilers, both here and in the comments, so if you haven't played, go and play it first.]

So a common question has probably plagued gamers for years, gnawed at their very hearts and souls as they struggled to find an answer to this question...

Which was the **best** Final Fantasy?

Take a look at some of the rankings out on the internet and you'll see some common things. 14 is at the bottom because it's a pile of shit. 6 is somewhere in the top 3 because it's a masterpiece. 7 floats around depending on the fanboyism of the writer. Really, ranking these games is pointless because *everyone* has their own personal preference and starting points in the series. 

But, what I think a bigger question is, which games are the most relevant to gaming as a whole?

Personally, Final Fantasy IX is probably one of the most relevant games ever. And this isn't out of fanboyism. I only picked this game up when it was released on the PSN two years ago, but even then, I was gobsmacked by how amazing the themes were. For those who didn't know, this was Hironobus Sakaguchi and Nobuo Uematsu's swansong to their careers at Square, and their efforts in creating this game really shine through. So what exactly was it that makes 9 so endearing? It's memorable cast? It's gorgeously detailed world? It's cute chocobos? Final Fantasy IX is still relevant because it answers a question that has been racking philosophers for a good amount of time.

Who am I?

-----

We see a lot of characters in gaming, from the busty adventurer Lara Croft to the poncy adventurer Nathan Drake, from the determined Mega Man to the brooding Alex Mercer. As an industry, characters have exploded in character in size. But, as gamers, we tend to group them according to their ""jobs"" or ""classes"", a throwback to the old days of pen-and-paper RPG's.

Final Fantasy was the medium's first huge video game that really defined RPG roles: Warrior, Thief, Black Belt, White Mage, Black Mage, and Red Mage. And for 6 games, Final Fantasy basically kept characters within this mold. It wasn't until 7 and 8 when they realized they could change the medium, and they did so successfully. But, their jarring switch to the darker, technocentric mood seemed to alienate players who wanted to play a good ol' fashioned RPG. So, as the last game of the PSX, he created 9 to be a throwback to the older series.

And Sakaguchi did an amazing job. I can really talk all day about the themes and characters strewn throughout the game, from the meta 3-act setup and themes involving theater to the details in background scenes and actions. But what I want to talk about are the battle mechanics themselves, because this is where the game really shines in answering the question stated above

Now, the battle system was weird. Compared to 7, 8, and even 5 and 6, the game was extremely rigid. Each of the characters had a predetermined class with predetermined abilities (Zidane the thief, Dagger and Eiko the white mages/summoners, Vivi the black mage, Steiner the Warrior, Freya the Dragoon, Quina the Blue Mage, and Amarant the Monk). You couldn't shuffle classes or exchange materia or crystals or points. You had to play each of these characters as they are. Almost universally the combat was considered inferior to the story, as it not only retained the aging ATB model, but it also took a few steps backwards in terms of variability and that goddamn awful Trance system. And I can't really find an excuse for the ATB system, as it was just Square latching on to their tried and true mechanic, but the class rigidity and Trance system did actually serve a purpose (yes, Trance was important. I know it was shit, but it's important).

So, each characters not only had their own class, but their own weapons as well, from which they learned their relevant abilities. And, if we think about it, what weapon you use as a character really does define your class. How weird and out of place would it have been if Steiner, the stalwart Captain of the Knights of Pluto, wielded a rod with a fancy little decoration? That's not manly. In the same way we wouldn't see Vivi try and use a big-ass sword. That little guy can barely lift it from one end. And in the same way, they have their respective abilities. Freya had that fucking awesome Dragon's Crest attack that was simply leveled by, what do you know, killing dragons. Amarant's abilities focused on his single-target attacks, making his BAMF levels all the more awesome. And who out there didn't enjoy Vivi's x2 Reflect damage bonus? That shit was insane to use.

Why is this important? Well, think about how each of the character's respective classes affected their characters when we first meet them. Zidane was teh laydeez's man, without a single care in the world. Vivi was insecure and shy. Steiner was all knightly and loyal and shit to his country and kingdom. Quina was...well...weird. Their classes defined their character. And this wasn't limited to the protagonists. In fact, we can see other characters wield their weapons in the same defining way as well. Queen Brahne was the mad Queen who lead a huge army. Kuja was the mysterious sorcerer with powerful magicks that complemented his twisted personality. Even Garland, who we don't really meet until the middle of the game, had the Invincible that rained the apocalypse on all who gazed upon it. Even the background characters, you'll see a lot of them holding something, whether it be a carpenter's hammer or a noblewoman's fan, all defining their character.

But this all makes the characters seem one-dimensional, doesn't it? That, my friend, is wrong, because ALL of the characters, especially the protagonists, confront two things that make them more real: rejection of their character, and embrace of their character. (Going into detail of each major character will take a **long** time, so instead I'll be typing their analysis up in the comments and permalink to them separately, so you can make your own comments on the characters. Go read some of them first, then come back).

Read them? Now you'll understand just how powerful the game is in terms of their mechanics and storytelling. From the Active Time Events detailing different characters to the little side missions that flesh out the world a little more at a time, Gaia is truly a place worth delving into.

-----

And, for me, after defeating Necron and watching Zidane embrace Dagger at the end, it caused a moment of self reflection. How exactly do I define myself? What lead me to pursue the life I'm leading right now? What am I running away from or refusing to confront? Am I who I want to be? For two years, I've been wondering why I keep going back to Final Fantasy 9, why I seem to remember all of the characters and reminisce on its themes. And, after thinking about it, I think I've come to a conclusion

See, games can engage you in fun. Games can engage your senses with visuals and music. Games can even engage your emotions through fear or hilarity.

As a whole, Final Fantasy IX really can cause you to just think about your own place in life. And anything, from books to television, from games to movies, that causes you stop and ponder on your own humanity is a game that is truly relevant in our lives.

Happy 12th Birthday, Final Fantasy IX.

In games with regenerating health, harder difficulty levels usually mean that you die in at most two hits, so whenever you take a hit you need to hide behind cover and letting your health regenerate. I find that games with regenerating health aren't well balanced with regards to this, and you just end up having to spend 99% of your time hiding behind cover and taking down enemies one by one until a stray bullet hits you and you have to start over. This ends up being very boring and unfun. There is no tactical play involved most of the time.

The thing is, having a multiplayer co-op seems completely unintuitive. The scariest parts of any game are when you're on your own. With a friend there, you make things much less scary. With other people, you have someone to talk to and someone to watch your back, removing isolation, which is one of the biggest factors of horror. Also, when playing with a friend people tend to do a lot more messing around, so they'll miss a lot of the horror set pieces. Here are some of the ways I'd try and combat this:

---
**Split the players up:** 

Splitting the players up would probably be an easy way to ramp up tension. Not only can you use the tried and testes single-player horror methods, but you can now make it so P1 can see P2, but not the other way around.

For example, P1 finds themselves behind a one way mirror, and can see P2. Then, you spawn a monster behind P2. Only P1 can see it, but can't tell P2. This will add tension for P1, because how do they know when a monster is behind them. What can P1 do to tell P2?

---
**Question the reality of the other players:**

Now, this one sort of links in with the previous one. This involves moving P1 around, but not telling P2. 

For example, P1 and P2 are walking down a corridor. Now, P1 is teleported out (behind a one way mirror maybe), but their NPC character is still left behind, walking down the corridor. P2 is not told about this, so they still think the real, human P1 is walking along with them. 

You can now use this to mess with P2. What if the NPC P1 starts attacking P2? How would P2 react. Now, after this event, P2 would never totally trust P1, because they might suddenly be changed with a hostile NPC. 

Now, what if they changed the skin of P2 into a monster. P1 would start attacking, but P2 is still a human player, so they would start attacking P1 back, thinking another event like what happened in the previous paragraph happened. You can use this simple effect of swapping a human with an NPC to make conflict between P1 and P2, and remove the trust between them. You can even use this to make them attack each other, adding a psycholoigcal aspect as they are question whether every monster is really a monster or a human in disguise.

---

**Show something to P1, but not to P2:**

Let's say P1 and P2 are walking down a long corridor. Now, P1 sees a monster at the end of the corridor, but P2 doesn't. Now, P1 will begin to question whether they really saw a monster, or whether it is their mind playing tricks. 

You can then extend this to monsters attacking the players. P1 and P2 can have a real monster attacking them that only P1 can see. Not only is P2 completely helpless in this situation, but P2 might see P1 acting wierd, attacking thin air, and think they have gone hostile, like mentioned in my first point.

---

**Contact between the players:**

Now, having microphone contact between the players would not really work in my opinion. While this couldn't really be helped when players are sitting next to each other, or talking over Skype, something like this would really add to the horror experience.

Instead, players would have set responses, ranging from 'Hello' and 'Over here' to 'Are you a monster'. Not only would this allow the NPCs to repond to players, but it would add a time lag between thinking something and saying it. 

For example, if P1 thinks P2 has been swapped with a monster, do they ask first, or start shooting? This will make situations much more tense, as the players will have much less time to think about their actions.

However, I'm a bit torn on this point, as it seems a bit gamey.

It got some mentions in most reviews as being surprising or well-done, but many reviews seemed to ignore it and focus more on the lackluster mechanics or the weak multiplayer.

Here's the thing about Spec Ops; it's not a nice game. It runs completely contrary to everything that modern military shooters are about. It takes the jingoistic pro-war stance that makes you feel like some sort of be-all last line of defense for freedom against the chaos of evil and completely turns it on it's head, revealing how ridiculous, and in some cases, terrible, so many shooters have become.

I normally don't think of shooting members of the Taliban in Medal of Honor as racist, and hunting drug lords in Ghost Recon was justified because orders were to take that man out. Call of Duty and Battlefield both have used Russians as their enemies, but that's fine, because they're Communists, and we need to be aware of that threat. At least, that's what I thought, until I played Spec Ops, where I spent 6 grueling hours gunning down American soldiers. The whole time, I couldn't help but feel that I was doing something wrong, because I was shooting Americans, and Americans are supposed to be the good guys, right? Well, why is it different with Latinos, African Americans, Arabs, or Russians? Why is it okay for them to be gunned down in droves by me and my comrades, but as soon as I see Americans in my sights, it's wrong? This is where I started to see how racist and lazy other shooters were, throwing non-American groups under the bus as an easy enemy for us to fight.

But Spec Ops goes even farther as far as shock is concerned. They're not content to stop there. I'm sure anyone who's played a modern military shooter is familiar with the level were you're put in a large vehicle and shoot enemies from a distance. Here are some examples.

[Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAscuD4loh8)

[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJelZ4-o80Y)

[Battlefield 3](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uFmZxjK-X0)

[Medal of Honor](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUu3X4W33UQ)

You don't need to watch all these in their entirety, as I'm sure you get the idea. Even Saints Row 3 gave you a mission where you used predator missiles, although to be fair, that game was meant to be more of a parody. Moving on though, Spec Ops included it's own [mission](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-b7TaLjdXMc) similar to this one, but they did something significantly different with theirs. Obviously it looks similar to other games gunship missions, but they then force you to face the consequences of what you've done, walking through the corpses you've just bombed, and then finding out you just bombed a civilian refugee camp.

This scene hit me hard, because I felt like it was such a standard scene that I'd done so many time in so many games, but here, I was seeing the consequences up close and personal, and finding out that I had done something truly terrible. This scene was a punch in the gut for me.

There are other moments, but I think I've made my point. Spec Ops stood as a huge criticism of modern military shooters which are currently flooding the gaming markets nowadays, and in my opinion, it was incredibly successful. And I think that the gaming press ignored it because it performed it's task so well.

The mainstream gaming media of today is seems to have become incredibly easy to please, with Call of Duty regularly scoring incredibly well, despite common complaints of it being stale and repetitive. Battlefield 3 was able to get away with a terrible campaign on it's multiplayer component alone. Other games that are largely considered to be merely average or simply well-executed are generally given very good reviews. Spec Ops struggled compared to many other games, however, with metacritic averages around the mid-70's. While some critics praised the single-player narrative, such as Ben Yahtzee or the show Extra Credits, most other sites tossed it aside, forgetting about it. Maybe it's because they're busy and only have so much time to commit to particular games that they couldn't give it the attention they thought it deserved. But I think something else is going on.

If the critics that praise games like Call of Duty and Battlefield were to turn around and give Spec Ops the credit it deserves, there would be some implications. First of all, they would be praising a game that's largely criticizing games like CoD and Battlefield, and they might have to start rethinking their opinions and stances on certain products. If they were to take the game's story seriously, they would have to start looking more critically at games like CoD and Battlefield, and this might shake things up a bit. Beyond that, they'd have to start weighing games more evenly, which while they'd agree is good, would require a lot more work and critical thought on their part, and might occasionally require them to take harder and less popular stances on certain things. To elaborate on this, Battlefield 3 was generally well-received with praise based on it's MP, despite a lacking single-player. Spec Ops, on the other hand, lost a lot of points because it's MP was lacking, although most would likely argue that the single-player was the main draw of the game. The point is, critics are sending the industry (and they've been sending this message for years now) that MP is ultimately more important that single-player. Both these issues are part of a larger problem with a gaming press that isn't willing to shake things up and take the hard stances on certain things. Rab Florence did an excellent [piece](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-10-24-lost-humanity-18-a-table-of-doritos) for Eurogamer that said this better than I can, but to summarize, we have journalists with little integrity who are simply trying to maintain their domination over the gaming press by releasing easy reviews.

One thing I often read about from reviews of games like Bioshock is how great it is to finally have a story that makes the player think about bigger issues, and how great those games are for pushing the medium forward artistically. And yet, it seems that those sorts of stories aren't really missed all that much during the sorts of games that depend on it's audience *not* thinking. Critics praise story when it's there, but when it's not, no harm done, and they're perfectly willing to check their brains at the door of their next gaming experience. Basically, there's no consistency here, and if gaming journalists were serious about wanting better narratives, they would've taken Spec Ops more seriously. I'm not saying it needed to be showered in GotY awards, but it seems to have largely been ignored, and I see a press that's scared to admit that a large part of that game was pointing at people like them, who've allowed our industry to become dominated by thoughtless and horrific games that make us feel empowered without ever making us grow.

Solving that may greenlight many ideas, including Motion Gaming’s rise to stardom.",RAA,561,198,228,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1cjfqx/why_have_consoles_consistently_failed_to_allow/,"I don’t understand the lack of flexibility console controller schemes have traditionally had. Why have PCs allowed keyboard mapping since gaming blossomed? Of course keyboards require mapping and have more input, but is it also because it’s difficult to implement/develop that feature for consoles? *Or is it due to coasting by on an industry standard?*


It’s not difficult to see how or why giving console gamers controller choice is worthwhile. **Inherently, giving more options based on personal input for control is always a good thing, and simply provides more opportunity to impart comfort and intuitive maneuvering**. Having 2 schemes is better than a single forced, rigid system, and adding any more has negligible detrimental effects. Developing and budgeting is a considerable difficulty, but it is a *challenge* and… we must set mind to purpose and tackle new designs to standardize procedure. Furthermore, allowing mapping of the controller to each button and function would be provide full choice and customizability, *similarly with no end-user consequences*. 


It adds a level of strategic decision making to competitive and single-player games, and provides more autonomy over a character. I never understood why this has gone by the wayside, or even given rise to discussion. Some games, like Halo, provide 8 different schemes, yet often times there is just one button that doesn’t quite jive, and is unmappable. 


Having considered the lack of consequences, **let’s consider the progressive benefits**. 


Why does motion gaming have such an antagonistic reputation? This is certainly a topic for another discussion, but one reason is because of failed implementation and difficulty in providing appeal. It’s rigidness in controlling may, similarly, not *jive with all players*. As such, we rarely see any form of implementation, even in the smallest attempts of voice activation of “reloads” or “squad commands”. 


I’m a staunch believer in how additional choice plus added complexity within games increases potential for immersion. *It takes a keen gamer to not only accept new forms of controlling, but to embrace them.*

---

**Provided that we might someday see controller mapping, why not set our sights higher and map Kinect/wiimote/PSmove functionality as well?**


Imagine picking up the box and reading “Playable as Kinect *or* traditional controller” and quizzically popping in the game. Upon playing the tutorial, the UI explains you can map your entire controller to each function, and *encourages* that you leave right-thumbstick as camera viewing, and left-thumbstick as player movement. 


It then allows you to map “reload” to X or Voice Command. It allows you to map your “grenade throw” to Left Trigger or to a throwing *gesture* with your left hand. It allows you to map your “melee” to B or to a right elbow *gesture*. It gives you all sorts of options, and you can be intuitive about it (it makes sense to map “kick” to the Left Bumper or to an actual kick *gesture*) or silly about it as you map the entire set of controls to voice commands. 


**I am consistently puzzled at the hatred of Motion Gaming, yet understand its incredibly shallow representation thus far. However, it’s still in its toddlerhood, and hasn’t yet hit puberty.** Mature gaming, which is what it’s often compared to, has 20 years of life under its belt across plenty of experimentation and design attempts. Motion Gaming on the other hand gets undercut before even lifting off. There are many ideas for *gestures* and *voice commands* could be implemented, and while everyone grabs pitchforks and chastises the industry for its lack of creativity,  developers fail to even attempt small features to set their games apart in any way.


*Why?* No one wants to see motion gaming because no good games use it, and no good games use it because no one wants to see it. The cyclical, almost fearful alienation of these Motion controls from more traditional genres is more than a little perplexing, and reactionary. 


I can completely acknowledge that if you’re forced into controlling one way or another (as mentioned with my critique of lack of mapping abilities in general) you’re going to be upset. When you’re forced to use gestures and motion gaming you may become bitter towards them, but when you’re given the option of choice and strategic mapping abilities, you’re liberated.

I followed the development of FF XIV and was excited when it was released. At the time my computer couldn't handle it and it was available on my PS3 so I didn't end up playing it. As we all know it was slammed for being buggy, lack of polish, and overall rushed released.

It seems that Square Enix was quick to respond and eventually announced A Realm Reborn for FF XIV. Since I personally have not been slighted by the game, I am excited to see how it plays out and want to try FF XIV ARR.

With that as a background, **I wanted to see what others thought of developers doing large scale changes for games they release**. For another example CD Projekt did this with Witcher releasing both a giant patch for the game and a retail release for Witcher: Enhanced Edition. 
Do developers rely to heavily on the fact that they can **now** patch through the internet? Or does this ""always on"" gaming make for better, more polished gaming experiences?

1372436203.0,357,self.truegaming,1h97fz,An idea for a death system in a linear game.,Senile57,500,143,154,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1h97fz/an_idea_for_a_death_system_in_a_linear_game/,"I was playing Fallout New Vegas the other day, and I realized something. I had no fear of dying in this game. If I went into a room and got shot to pieces, it wasn't a problem, because I could just press a button and regenerate instantly. I thought about it a bit, and realized this problem seemed to be widespread. There's the Bethesda way (just using Bethesda games as an example), where there's absolutely no consequence for dying, and especially in linear games, you just have to exploit the game until you win if you have low health.  Then there's the Day Z permadeath way which seems to be becoming more popular, in which if you die, you simply lose everything and go back to square one. I don't think this is a very good system, simply because it will simply aggravate all but the most hardcore players (not blaming Day Z for that choice, as it wants to be as realistic as possible, just saying about the permadeath system as a whole.) Then there's the checkpoints system for linear games, which is the same as the quick save method, in that if you die, you just try again until you succeed, with no punishment for dying except ""Do it again!"". There's some others, like dying taking points off you, but those are the major ones.

So, I came up with a new system for death in games. It's not very fleshed out yet, but I think the basics are there. So, we have this hypothetical game, lets call it Man Shooter. It's a linear Stealth-Action game. You start the game off as a normal person, who gets caught up in events far larger than him (I haven't really thought about the story much.) You have some sort of connection to the main villain, maybe you were his childhood friend, or brother, or something. Playing as this character throughout the game will result in a very stealthy play through, as this characters ability's, traits, strengths, whatever, are best suited to stealth. If you play through the game as this character without dying, you will reach the end of the game, the villain, having an emotional connection to you, will reveal everything, and the game will end. A very satisfying ending.

However, if you die as this character in a level, that character will be dead for the sake of the story, and you will switch to a new character. Say if you died in a burning building, you will switch to a firefighter rushing to put out the blaze, for example. This firefighter will find your old characters body, and maybe find an object or a note on your old characters body that encourages him to follow the story. Now, here's the crucial part. That firefighter would have a different play style, and a different ending. The play style would be more leaning towards action and less towards stealth, maybe you're still a normal guy but you have a stonking great fireman's axe, for example, so you have the risky option of just hitting people with the axe. The ending would also be different, and less fulfilling, because the villain will not have the connection to you like he did the original character, so he won't explain anything. This will leave some ambiguity in the ending, not everything is nicely tied up.

Then, if you die as the fireman, you will switch to a new character, say a SWAT soldier for example. His play style will basically be to go in and shoot stuff, and his ending will be the general saying ""Well done, soldier. Get back to base!"", or something along those lines. The punishment for you screwing up too many times will be a worse ending because of who you're character is, and the circumstances of the story, instead of the ""Bad Karma"" ending in the Fallout games which is triggered by having enough negative karma points. These are all just examples, and in a full game you would have a lot more characters so that you could die a bit more and still get an okay ending, and more personality, individual traits and items for each character.

I think this sort of system would make some games a lot more interesting. It may lead itself to a more complex story, it would punish you for screwing up without being aggravating like the permadeath system, and it would probably lend itself to a lot of replayability, which seems to be something linear games like CoD and so forth are lacking in.

Would there be serious problems with this idea? Would it ruin the story to be constantly jumping around? Is encouraging flawless, no death runs something people would be interested in? Are there actually problems with how death is worked with in games, or am I seeing problems where there aren't any? Is it a good idea?

The power gap is smaller than Wii to XB360/PS3, but it still is proving to be troublesome for 3rd parties. Honestly, it's way too early to call Wii U a failure since the other consoles haven't even hit the market yet, but this got me thinking about what could happen in the NEXT console generation (Generation 9). Gen 7 was already the longest console generation yet, due the expensive hardware of the consoles. Most likely this generation will last even longer, considering the fact, that these consoles will take years before they can be used to even 75% of their potential. So where does that leave Nintendo? Wii U is in a weird gap between PS3 and PS4 power. Most analysts predicted that this would be a downfall for Nintendo, but it also leaves them in a unique position: they can continue the regular console cycle. It's possible that in 5-6 years (maybe a bit longer), they can release the Nintendo7, or whatever they want to call their next console. By that time, they could have specs that  easily trump Gen 8, while MS and Sony would still be supporting their very expensive consoles (remember, it took years for either of them to make a profit on their consoles, due to high cost, they will most likely need to support these consoles for 9-10 years to see profit). What do you think?  

Also, I'm not trying to make a generic ""Ninty is great!!!11"" post, but this seems like a good business decision, and maybe they planned this all along. Maybe I'm completely wrong, I just want to hear your opinions.

Edit: I think I have may have sent the wrong message across with my title. I guess the question I want to ask  would be: Is Nintendo trying to break away from the typical console release cycle?

Edit 2: When I say a more powerful console, I'm talking along the lines of the Wii U compared to 360: 2GB of RAM compared to 512MB. Something not revolutionary, but an improvement nonetheless.

Sonic Team with games like Chu Chu Rocket, Samba de Amigo, Nights, PSO for games other then Sonic.
AM2 with Shenmue, Virtua Cop. UGA with Space Channel 5, Rez. Smilebit with Jet Set Radio, Panzer Dragoon. Hitmaker with Crazy Taxi and Virtua Tennis. Amusment Vision with Monkey Ball and F-Zero GX. Overworks with Skies of Arcadia and the PS2 Shinobi. WOW with Sega GT, House of the Dead, Golden Axe and Streets of Rage.

After 2004 when the Dreamcast went out and games that were most likely to have come out on Dreamcast ran out, all these subsidary names were gone, the Teams absorbed, reshuffled and their output was different, many people were confused, and what happened to the Teams and what have they been making since then?

Here's what happened, and these Teams have done since then:

Back then all the (8) Teams were making Games for Consoles and Arcades.

Now it's split up between Consumer (gaming devices) and Amusment (Arcades) Divisions. 

Sonic Team got merged with UGA. The UGA people being behind the Music games on the Dreamcast. Mizuguchi who was part of UGA didn't like that, and moved on with some of his peeps to foem Q? Entertaiment. The Remaining parts of UGA went on to make Feel the Magic and Rub Rabbits for DS, and also Poles Big Adventure, a parody plattformer only for WiiWare in Japan. The rythum game division from the people that made Space Channel 5 and Samba de Amigo, went on to make the Hatsune Miku games, and Rythm Thief as a one off. Also the Sonic Riders games were also the Idea of the former UGA Studios, probably not intented being Sonic games.
Phantasy Star games, continue to be made with the same team.

Smilebit and Amusment Visionwent and key members of the Shenmue Team on to make the Yakuza and Super Monkey Ball games, and most recently Binary Domain. Pretty self-explanitory. 

Overworks still makes JRPG's after Skies of Arcadia, like Valkyria Chronicles games, and the Shining and 7th Dragon games that probably will stay in Japan. 

People wonder why Sega hasn't been making any Action games anymore like Streets of Rage and Golden Axe or even the controversial Shinobi game on PS2.
There were beat-em-ups made by AM3 and Amusment Vision, like the Spikeout series and Dynamit Cop. But I think these elements moved on to the Fighting of Yakuza. And the Shinobi PS2 sequel aspect to the 3rd person aspect of Valkyria Chronicles.

Now the Arcade Divisions, these all blended in together, with only Virtua Fighter 5 keeping the AM2 Brand name.
While back then Arcade ports were common on Sega consoles since they exactly like their Arcade units. Now it's not anymore.
Sega still makes Rail-Shooters and Racing games and we got a spiritual successor to Virtual-On, Border Break (that currently stays in Japan)
The only home ports that we've got are the Virtua Fighter and Tennis games. And also the reimagining of After Burner.
Look through the catalouge here. Since Lindbergh is were games were rarely ported anymore. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Sega_arcade_games

I wrote that in response to someone describing a certain scene in Deus Ex: Human Revolution.  That wasn't actually a lying objective marker, but rather showing choices to the player.  However, the comment got a surprising number of upvotes.

I've been toying with a concept of an AI gone wrong, in a world where everyone's tied together and an AR UI is the norm.  Cyberpunk world.  We already depend on smartphones for a lot in our lives - from scheduling to organizing.  Some people are already using cameras to record constant memories to a cloud.  Something like Google Glasses is toying with the idea of bring that sort of UI to life.  Human function is going out there, and no longer internalized in the imperfect machine that is humanity.

Anyway, part of the idea involved networking everyone together as we are already via smartphones and social networks.  The concept of the ""game"" is that the very UI you depend on is lying to you.  You'd have to figure it out as a player, but I'm imagining how that could even work.  

What would you picture as a consequence of this.  Would you feel betrayed or wowed by such a revelation?  Would you prefer it to be subtle or not?

I'm thinking of making a short prototype together in a few months (likely with UDK with the included assets).  Something like The Stanley Parable, in which someone is going through a routine job that goes very, very, wrong.  Or a murder mystery in which the helpful UI is less than helpful.

I'd like to know r/truegaming's thoughts on it.

Edit: I'm getting great feedback, as well as examples from games that already do this.  So let's broaden this a bit - 

What do you feel is useful information in a UI, that you trust implicitly as a gamer?

Also, Yahtzee had a [Survival on a Cruise Ship](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/columns/extra-punctuation/9423-Survival-Horror-on-a-Cruise-Ship) idea with the UI as an interactive element.

The first system that didn't launch with a Mario. When Super Mario Sunshine did release, it featured a mostly tropical theme as well as the contentious FLUDD as a primary gameplay mechanic.

They changed Metroid from a side-scrolling platformer to a First-Person Shooter. Not only that, but they had an outside studio make it.

The first Zelda game utilized a dramatic shift in style from the more realistic look of the N64 entries (and the Space World 2000 tech demo) to the very cartoonish look that many people initially rejected (I liked it and still do, very much). The overworld was changed in a drastic way as well, requiring players to navigate a huge ocean instead of exploring on land.

The Donkey Kong series required a conga peripheral to be played.

They also created a new franchise in Pikmin, their first RTS (of sorts, as far as I know).

That's all I can think of right now, but I never really realized the extent to which Nintendo went to try to change up their formulas on the GameCube. 

Can anyone think of any other major changes to IPs that were tried on the GameCube? Does anyone think that another console took the bigger risks as far as Nintendo's franchises are concerned?

I really enjoyed it; it was far from perfect, but the game had a lot of good ideas. I heard Assassin's Creed 2 was an improvement in all aspects, so I eagerly jumped right into it once I beat the first.

Honestly, I almost quit the game. Here's why.

AC1 is a stealth game. At least, it's meant to be played as one. I saw a lot of people complaining about the combat, and that's a fair critique. But I didn't mind it, and I finished Devil May Cry 3 right before this game, which is praised for its complex combat system. This combat is simple and repetitive, but the game heavily suggests that you should use your hidden knife as much as you can to avoid drawn-out combat. Assassination missions go as you swayed them to go. When I failed a mission, it felt like my fault and I had to change my strategy.

As for combat, it wasn't great, but it felt deliberate in a way. Altair is a trained assassin, but he's only one man, and fighting 10+ guards wasn't a breeze. There was actually some strategy to it, should I make the first move or wait and counter? I did like in AC2, however, you could still do hidden blade take-downs once combat has engaged.

What almost ruined AC2 for me were the tutorials. Granted, AC1 was a linear experience while AC2 is a sandbox game, however, this is something I really loathe in modern games. When developers make a big game they find it necessary to spell out how everything works. But in AC1, the tutorials were optional, and you learned the game mechanics by just playing the game.

I eventually let AC2 sink its teeth into me, but I oddly didn't warm up to it as quickly as I did with AC1, and I think it's because of expectations. I went into AC1 expecting an okay game and was pleasantly surprised, while I went into AC2 expecting everything to be improved, which, ultimately I got, but it was presented in a more gradual pacing that nearly killed it for me. It also didn't help that it's a completely different type of game altogether. AC2 is not a stealth game. You never need stealth, your opponents can get killed in a colorful myriad of methods, and you never feel over-powered, not even in the beginning of the game, because game play felt scripted.

I just let the game be what it was, and I was pretty happy with the results. I took the time to explore the village, chuckled at the fact that the monkeys sound like headcrabs, and just let myself enjoy the exploration of the world.

What's the deepest thought you've found in a game?,Weeperblast,442,95,386,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/13rz6u/stalker_shadow_of_chernobyl_asks_one_of_the_most/,"If you haven't played this game, do so now. I'll wait. Spoilers lie ahead. If you've already played it, good.

I'm going to try to explain all the major parts of the game as briefly as possible, though the storyline is so well composed it's hard to leave too much out: You play an amnesiac STALKER, an outlaw adventurer that seeks the riches hidden in the deadly no-mans land left over from the Chernobyl Disaster. Presumed to be dead, you awake in the den of a ruthless and manipulative trader, who tasks you with increasingly reckless and dangerous missions in exchange for information about your past. All you know about who you were is what was left on your PDA, a single task left on your to-do list: KILL THE STRELOK.

Navigating through the twisted and blasted Zone is a treacherous feat: the wilderness is dotted with bizarre 'anomalies', places where the laws of nature are forgotten. An errant step might find you electrocuted to steaming eschar, or compacted into a singularity, or you might just burst into flames. Hidden in these anomalies are even stranger artifacts, odd oblong lumps of matter that, when held close to your skin, grant mixed blessings: Your skin might resist penetration by gunfire, but your blood is thinner, and therefore you bleed out quicker. Additionally, you fight bandits and renegades, terrifying mutants, and the brainwashed supersoldiers of the Monolith. You can side with one of two factions: the anarchistic Freedom or the fascist Duty. Both have major flaws, and both can't see any other end to their disagreements save for the utter annihilation of the opposing faction.

As you progress through the game, you learn more about Strelok. You're tracking down his dead friends, trying to piece together his future whereabouts. Eventually, you reach a critical point in the game, where you must enter a region known as the 'Brain Scorcher'. It got this name for the fact that, for whatever reason, anyone who goes there is either killed outright or turned into a mumbling, shambling invalid. No one comes out.

You have an edge, though. You've worked with a scientist named Sakharov, and he's created a prototype helmet that can prevent the affects of the brain scorcher from crippling you.

Though you must wade through some of the toughest combat in the game, you succeed at deactivating the device. This opens the way the dead city of Pripyat, and eventually, the heart of the disaster: the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. Throughout the city, the incredibly valuable artifacts are up for grabs.

Every faction surges to the city, and the the streets convulse with violence as veteran STALKERs face off against the unbreakable Monolith. Eventually, if you follow the path to find and kill the STRELOK, you'll find yourself inside a secret chamber within the Chernobyl NPP. Here, in a vault bathed in radioactivity, you're greeted by a hologram composite of many scientists. It greets you. ""Hello, Strelok.""

That's the reveal. You are strelok, and you were an agent in employ of the composite before you. This is where my description must give way to the Wikipedia summary:

*In the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster, the Soviet Union decided to use the Exclusion Zone for special research into the human mind. Results included enhanced ESP, psychic weapons, and the eventual formation of a hivemind of seven neurally linked scientists known as the C-Consciousness. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the self-aware C-Consciousness took control of the Zone and continued its research. It attempted to bring about world peace through global mind control by directly interacting with the noosphere; however, these attempts resulted in the unintentional twisting of the physical terrain around Chernobyl as well as the mutation of resident life forms, creating the Zone. In an attempt to hide its existence the C-Consciousness created the two Brain Scorcher fields and erected a Monolith artifact - the Wish Granter - in the center of the Zone, which it uses to brainwash any stalkers who reach it; brainwashed stalkers are tattooed with the ""S.T.A.L.K.E.R."" acronym and reprogrammed to serve the C-Consciousness.

Rumors of the Wish Granter began to spread throughout the Zone. A group of four stalkers (Strelok, Ghost, Fang, and Doc) attempted to reach the Wish Granter, but after encountering the fanatical Monolith faction they were forced to retreat. Strelok was knocked unconscious during a ""blowout"" while the others were able to escape. On the way back Fang was killed by a sniper in Pripyat; some time later Ghost was killed in the Brain Scorcher control facility under Yantar.

The unconscious Strelok was discovered by the C-Consciousness; unaware of his identity, it reprogrammed him and mistakenly assigned him the task of killing himself. On the way out of the Zone the truck carrying the still unconscious Strelok was destroyed in a lightning storm and he was discovered by another passing stalker, leading into the events at the beginning of the game.

Once the C-Consciousness has finished answering Marked One/Strelok's questions he is given a choice: merge with the C-Consciousness to ensure its continued existence, or stop the C-Consciousness from continuing its experiments. If Strelok refuses to assist the C-Consciousness he is transported to the exterior of the Chernobyl plant, where he navigates his way through teleportation anomalies and armed Monolith soldiers in order to reach the source of the C-Consciousness. Once inside Strelok shoots the encapsulated scientists which form the C-Consciousness.

Afterward Strelok is shown standing in a grassy field, watching the sky as the clouds break and the sun comes out. The Zone is apparently gone. He questions whether or not he made the right decision, but as he lays down in the grass he concludes that while he may never know what was right, he is happy that he survived.*

TL;DR:

A man walks through a horrifying example of human greed, hubris, and arrogance, sees violence and betrayal on a gigantic scale. He finds out that there is an organization that claims to have a device that can enter the fabric of human thought, and gradually remove hateful, greedy, destructive thoughts from our collective consciousness.

Do you join, or do you stop them?

To me, the question posed by the C-Consciousness is wild and profound. Would I deceive the whole human race for what could amount to be an unattainable ideal? Or, on the other hand, would I stop them from pulling the wool over our eyes, and damn the human race to an eternity of suffering in truth?

I honestly don't know what I would do. What would you say?

Gabe's idea of educating parents on these things through the PTA is fantastic.  Even if it was only to show them how to use the parental settings on current consoles.  I'll let you all read it for yourself:

""I’ve gone into my son’s school to teach cartooning since he was in Kindergarten. He’s in second grade now and it’s still something I look forward to every year. I really love working with kids and teaching art. It usually ends up making for some good Penny Arcade comics too.

Aside from me calling some dude on the phone, today’s comic strip is completely true. It really shocked me that this little girl who could not have been more than 7 or 8 was asking me to draw the fucking Slender Man. It got me thinking about these kid’s parents and just how much they know about the games their kids are playing. I don’t think that we need less sex and violence in games. What I think we need are parents who are better educated about games and pay closer attention to what their kids are playing.

My first reaction when I see something like the Katie Couric special or the NRA rant against games is to get pissed off. When I hear stories about a kid playing a game for 72 hours straight I don’t want to ban violent games, I want to ban parents who don’t give a shit what their kid is doing for three fucking days. I want to scream at parents who let their eight year olds play Gears of War and Call of Duty on XBOX Live. That’s not especially productive though and so I started trying to figure out what I can actually do to solve the problem. As a parent and someone who is extremely plugged into the video game scene how can I help? What I decided to do was send an email to the PTA at my son’s school and ask if I could set up a parent education night.

What I proposed is a hour long session in which I would teach parents about the ESRB rating system but that’s just the beginning. I would also talk about the games I know their kids are playing and the games they want to play. I’d talk about Minecraft and what sorts of things playing on a public server might expose them to. Hell I bet lots of them don’t even understand the concept of a public server. I can tell them How Xbox live works and what their kids might be hearing when they have that headset on. I’d talk about games that are great to play WITH your kids and maybe even give some ideas for games that they as adults might enjoy. Listen I understand that being a parent is hard. Sometimes you just don’t have all the info and maybe you don’t know how to find it. Well in this one specific instance I can help.

So I decided that my way of doing something is to educate. The PTA got back to me and they like the idea. We’re working out the details now and I’m really excited. Maybe I can help some parents understand games better and possibly even connect with their kids in a new way.

But the UI is very, very obviously not built for a PC game. They added PC graphics options this time around, but you can tell by using the UI that it's not adapted for the PC- not even the graphics options UI is adapted for the PC!

1. Items must be selected to be modified. You cannot click the tab to increase or decrease an option without first clicking to select. 

2. Hovering the mouse away from an option deselects it and does not select another option. It ""disconnects"", in a way. Start a new game and look at character creation. Slide the mouse across the outfit options- it doesn't really ""hook"" to the options like it should. Click an option and move to another. Can you feel something wrong? Now try doing the same with the keyboard. Up/down, enter instead of clicking. Significantly smoother and no disconnect.

3.  All in-game menus have hotkey listings. Enter to approve, escape to go back, etc. You CAN navigate them with the mouse, but theres no visual feedback for doing so. Nothing is highlighted when clicking to turn in a quest (except for selecting a reward). There's no indication that you can even do so by clicking, so you move one of your hands to press the enter button, which is just weird.

I'd go so far as to say that the unbelievably slippery mouse controls in general (the game defaults the sensitivity to about 500x what it should be) are also a result of the same, but that one I'm not so sure about. Maybe everyone at Gearbox simply uses really, really, really low sensitivity mice? The first game had a similar problem of ridiculous over-sensitivity, as well.

It's not *as bad* as with Skyrim, but I think it's pretty clear that the UI was built around the console experience and using the mouse is tacked on, and not an intended way of using the UI...in a PC title. But I've seen nobody bringing this up.

I would have thought that with Jason's brother being in the military that the group of friends would understand the kind of strain that a person gets when they are made to perform these actions, and it seem totally ignorant that they would actually accuse Jason of being selfish.

I approached it with a different mindset and had a lot more fun.

I don't want to discuss the merits/flaws of the game or suggest people try it again, what interested me was the different mindsets I could have while playing the same game and how they effected my enjoyment of it.

The first time I played was my typical completionist style. I would arrive in a town, run around exploring everything and getting all the quests/books/etc, then trying to work through those before moving on to the next area. That works great in The Witcher, Dragon's Age or WoW, but got very frustrating in Skyrim because I would pick up a few new quests whenever I went out to finish one and it became this never ending grind of quests/areas that all started to seem quite similar/shallow. My agency was as a player playing a game and my motivation was to experience all the content.

This weekend, I had the idea to play not as an open world game, but as a linear game within an open world. I decided on a motivation for my character, and then I reacted to quests based on that motivation. I didn't talk to anyone in Helgen after the Stormclock's sister asked me to tell the Jarl about the dragon, because there was no time to muck around. I stuck to the main questline, taking only brief detours when the main quest wasn't urgent. I enjoyed it significantly more than the first time, the experience did not feel shallow (because I was not trying to complete dozens of similar quests/areas), and I think I could replay it as different characters taking different paths to have a different experience each time. My agency was as a character in the game and my motivation was to stop the dragons and kick the Empire out of Skyrim.

A company develops a game that is released to critical acclaim and, to them, more importantly, commercial success. They want more of the latter, so they ask the creative leads who were responsible for how the game turned out to keep iterating on the same idea. Even if, for whatever reason, they acquiesce, and stick with the company while making the same games over and over for years, eventually, they hit a breaking point, and leave to do their own thing on their own terms. 

Yuji Naka was the lead programmer of Sonic 1, and eventually became the lead of Sonic Team. The last Sonic game he made before leaving Sega to start his own company was Sonic 2006. Remember how awesome the fishing levels were in Sonic Adventure? Dude made a fishing game for the Wii.

Keiji Inafune was a top dog at Capcom, but the only way he could convince the company to fund new IPs is by overspending on the prototypes so significantly that they had no choice but to justify the millions spent on R&amp;amp;D by developing full games. He did this for Dead Rising and Lost Planet. They became successful, and had numerous sequels before Inafune got fed up, quit, and founded Comcept.

Capcom's Clover Studio developed 6 games. Half of them were sequels/spinoffs of the first. Then they all left Capcom to start their own company, PlatinumGames, and have been putting out new IPs ever since.

People are excited for the new Sonic games that were just announced, even though Yuji Naka and essentially none of the people responsible for making Sonic as revered has he was in his prime have anything to do with them.

Capcom announced that they have a ""big surprise"" in store for E3. People's #1 hope is a Megaman Legends 3 announcement, though they'll settle for Dead Rising 3. Even though Inafune hasn't had anything to do with Capcom in over 2 years.

I'm also willing to bet that most people who complained about DmC never bothered to play Bayonetta, which is arguably the true followup to the original Devil May Cry.

Fighting game fans wanted a new Street Fighter. They were more concerned about their favorite character getting in than anything else, so Capcom accommodated damn near everyone in that respect, but was a complete letdown in almost all others. We ended up with a buggy game that had infinite combos discovered in under a week, with tons of disc-locked content that is crucial to the game's competitive experience.

I could go on, but the short of it is: why do we, as gamers, keep setting ourselves up for disappointment? Why are we unable to recognize that it's Keiji Inafune's, Hideki Kamiya's, and Hidetoshi Ishizawa's design we love, and not the IPs we experience it through?

So, I skipped most cutscenes and I looked up guides for the dialogue-events, without paying too much attention to it (I admit - it was a mistake); instead - I focused on playing as a ghost.

I would very carefully plan my routes, I limited myself from using any of the augmentation-powers, therefore, experience points never really mattered to me that much, and I didn't bother with a lot of the challenges. But I enjoyed the game a lot. I enjoyed all of the little additions and all of the attention to detail that the developers had, and I had a good time. That was about two years ago, and I kind of forgot about the game since then. But, I got my hands on Dishonored last week, and I loved the stealth, and I figured heh, that's not quite satisfying my stealthy-gameplay cravings right now, let's see what I can play through again. And Deus Ex caught my eye, and I remembered all the good times I had, but somehow the story was kind of not there, so I thought - well, I guess I'll give it a go, I got nothing to lose.

And I decided to role-play; I decided that I would try to put myself in Adam's shoes first, before looking at things from a gameplay point of view, and holy crap, do I recommend it.

The thing is... Adam Jensen is not a happy person, and the game, if you let it, really drives that under your own skin - you start feeling kind of sad for the dude, and his cold, monotone voice starts to seem more and more like a mask for someone who's dealing with plenty of emotional damage of his own. And I'm not talking about the big things that are revealed about him through the story, no - if you look hard enough, you can catch a lot of sad, sad details about this man, and every time something seemingly good happens in the plot, I found myself actually getting excited about him - his life would finally stop looking so grim and dark. It's difficult to talk about it without spoiling the game, but, at one point in the story, you get the chance to save a colleague from big trouble. In order to do it though, you have to kill some bad guys, but if you're playing non-lethally, that might prove to be a problem. Well, when that moment came for me, this time around (I was again, playing non-lethally), I really didn't think twice - I went in guns blazing, and killed everyone, as quickly and as ruthlessly as I could - they were not going to mess with my friends.

And when that passed, when I had killed all the baddies, I looked back at the scene and I thought, ""Did that really happen? Did I just react in this game, not for the game's sake? Damn.""

Throughout the game, if you read all of the e-mails on computers that are made available to you, if you've invested enough in the hacking skill, you come to realize that these people you're interacting with, or even ones you've never heard about - seem to interact with each other as well; they have their own opinions, worries, conflicts and secrets, and you're getting to see things from their point of view, in this futuristic world that they have to deal with. And they deal with it in a very realistic way.

Even Adam Jensen has had his own life, until you, the player, have come for just a short period of time, and this life of his, continues, after you're gone. It's really rewarding, to see this dark personality for what it truly is - a good, compassionate man, who has just had a lot of shit happen to him in his life, trying to hold it together, and trying to do the right thing. It really makes me feel like the game isn't a game, more than it is a window, to see the world through the eyes of someone else. If you're willing to role-play enough, that is. I mean, I know it's just a game, like a movie is just a movie, or a book is just a book, and I don't know what your views on the topic of letting yourself be engulfed by a story are, but hey, this is what this board is all about, isn't it? :D

To anyone who hasn't yet played the game - do it. And pay attention to the details; check every computer terminal you come across, and read everything you can get your hands on - it really, really pays off, in my opinion. The game really made me feel like the main character, and it made me attached to the characters in his life - not many games can do that.

Are there any games that make you feel so attached to the characters?

* Best Sports/Fitness Game

* Best Action Game

* Castlevania SotN.  I played all the gba and ds metroidvanias as they came out but somehow missed this classic.

I never had a guide for the original LoZ and thus took over a decade to beat it, because I couldn't find the last few dungeons as a kid and said fuck it until years later.

* Morrowind.  It's my favorite RPG but it's way too easy to become an overpowered god.  You pretty much have to self impose heavy restrictions, mod the shit out of it or be a total TES noob to be challenged.

Reading over the comments and just looking at the final gathering of players had me empathetic and misty-eyed.  As we get into our games, associating strong personal bonds with them, it's almost like losing a loved one when a game goes down.  
My question is this: There are plenty of games that are marked as ""stunning"" and ""amazing"" but don't appeal to us at an emotional level.  What does it take for us (as far as qualities of a game or as a matter of our psychology) to develop that attachment?  And why don't these games top the gaming charts?

I know for something like City of Heroes, being your own comic book hero is something extremely personal and endearing, but what about other games you come across that you might not have thought you'd develop a bond with it, yet it impacted you all the same?

Edit:
It's interesting to see what everyone has come up with.  I was largely expecting lots of MMO type games to be discussed and few, if any, single player ones.  Many of you discuss the community for these games or strong story lines that draw you in.  Some of you mention how even a single character that help create that connection.  
Given how these games sometimes take up significant portions of our lives (i.e. I played Halo 2 with my best buddies every weekend in high school as a tradition - one I won't forget), all of this essentially becomes a big kick in the nostalgia.  We're remembering not just the game, but the powerful emotional states (maybe think of Fallout 3's blowing up of Megaton) and the friendships and traditions that come with those games.  

If I could pose a new question, I'd be curious to know if any of you can sense one of these strong connections with a modern game that's out and popular now?

I understand sometimes it's just a very hard mechanic to imitate, but some things this gen just came and went with  out ever sticking and it just shocked me.


LittleBigPlanet 2's creation tools and focus on community sharing were brilliant and arguably makes it the game of the generation in regards to connectivity, but no other games have dared to tread on such grounds. A game that started out as a 2(1/2)D platformer has been turned into a retro game, RPG, top-down shooter, FPS, racer, fighter, etc. by its community, and there's still infinite more that's capable of being made. Project Spark is a next gen game trying something similar, but it looks much more bound to its set rules and confines than LBP2 was.

LA Noire's facial animation was perfect and the system they used looked easy to develop for once the ground work is laid out. It baffles me that other companies, and even Rockstar, continue to use tradition motion capture as opposed to making the switch over.

Rockstar's human physics/reactions in GTA IV, RDR and Max Payne 3 are so realistic that  they have yet to even be close to matched. The way people react to every bullet, every physics object hitting them, the way their feet dynamically walk and turn, it is ridiculous. For me every other game of GTA's kind is dull in comparison because of the lack of these sorts of complex physics and I don't understand why the competition hasn't been able to match a game from 2007.

Heavy Rain's story arks and consequences for your actions are something I always feel every story driven game is lacking. The fact that there's no checkpoints and everything you do is final makes it insanely intense and redefines the risk/reward system in gaming. Other games like The Walking Dead attempt to do this, but there's still failure and a chance to try over every now and then. If every story based game had paths and more chances for failure that had consequences, they might actually be worth replaying. 

Mirror's Edge's parkour was so great it was basically what made the game what is was. I feel that every First Person game would benefit from a system like it or at least a toned down one. I know Brink tried it, but that did every thing else so half-assedly. Titanfall is trying it, but that game is only competitive multiplayer, and I feel that's a huge step in the wrong direction for gaming.

A familiar initialization  which effectively evokes a set of mechanics and attributes but does not, itself, have very much meaning.

I’ve not yet identified any other useful dichotomies which are sufficiently broad in their application, or in which the two sides of the dichotomy have sufficient mutual exclusivity. The four dichotomies I have identified are informative as to the experience the player will have. The dichotomies are thus:


**C**ontemplative – **R**eactive


This is dependent on how much time the player has to make decisions. At the far ends of the spectrum, we have the highly reactive Starcraft II, which requires players to make decisions with blinding speed in response to the choices of the opponent. On the flip side is Day of the Tentacle, where there are no bounds whatsoever on how long you have to make a decision in almost all cases.


**A**vatar – **D**irect


Games are Avatar games if there is an object on screen to represent the player. If they are acting directly on the world, it is a direct game. Direct games are often called “God’s-eye-view” games. In general, it is on this dichotomy that games are the most divergent. Consider whether the character has an identity beyond the player, as not all objects the player is able to move or manipulate are necessarily avatars.


**E**nemies – **O**bstacles


This depends on whether the player must overcome the environment/circumstances, or enemies/other players. Games in which players must overcome obstacles are approached differently by the player and designer alike. Those games which are obstacle focused but which still contain enemies often have enemies with predictable movement patterns, and which are not difficult to defeat, and are thus more like obstacles than enemies. As there are many games which focus tightly on combat with enemies, it is safe to be strict with this categorization.


**T**uned – **S**tatic


If the player significantly alters their avatar, abilities, or inventory in a way which affects game play, then it is a Tuned game. In Static games, while the player may gain new abilities, they do not manage an inventory or adjust a range of qualities, and play the game more or less as is. Often, new abilities or “power-ups” in static games are not controlled or altered by the player, who has little control over which power up is applied and when.

From these four dichotomies, we get the following sixteen categories:


**CAES** – Stealth Game (Metal Gear Solid, Splinter Cell)

**CAET** – Non-Time-Intensive Combat (Final Fantasy, Phantasy Star)

**CAOS** – Story Adventure (Monkey Island, L.A. Noire, Deadly Premonition)

**CAOT** – Minecraft-Like (Minecraft, Lego Creator)


**CDES** – Non-Time-Intensive Strategy (Civ Series, Age of Wonders)

**CDET** – Conflict Simulation (Football Manager, Magic)

**CDOS** – Pure Puzzle (Crayon Physics, Sudoku, World of Goo)

**CDOT** – Simulation (Sim City, Flight Simulator)


**RAES** – Combat (Streets of Rage, Tekken, Halo)

**RAET** – Strategic Adventure (Mass Effect, Skyrim, DotA)

**RAOS** – Obstacle Course (Sonic, Spyro, Rayman)

**RAOT** – Fast Vehicle Sim (Gran Turismo, Need for Speed, Hydro Thunder)


**RDES** – Tower Defense (Unstoppable Gorg)

**RDET** – Fast Strategy (Starcraft, Warcraft)

**RDOS** – Fast Puzzles (Tetris, Audiosurf, Chime)

**RDOT** – Puzzle Quest-Like (Puzzle Quest)



It is true that some categories, RDOT for instance, are exceptionally rare. It is also true that certain Myers-Briggs personality types only describe 1 percent of the population. That is the nature of such a system. It is also true that certain games will appear to be equally described by both sides of a dichotomy. Thankfully, games are rarely simple enough to fit into one category or another without some argument being present. Still, in these cases we should look to which behavior dominates gameplay. I would argue that Call of Duty, despite the ability of the player to customize characters, is a static game because the majority of players will simply pick one of the available classes.

If its some PVE fest, who cares. 

At any rate, there is non stop fervor over any hint of P2W in a game, with by far the most common criticism being it is an unearned advantage, and fights will not be fair. People want the fights to be determined by skill alone.

Fine. I can accept that argument, and agree with it.

But most of the games where P2W could be implemented also feature Grind2Win. Your character levels, you gain skills, equipment, etc. Leading to an unfair advantage over another who hasn't played as much. And this is simply ignored, the focus completely on whatever P2W attributes exist.

These are supposed to be skill based PVP games, yet of all the F2P PVP games out there, G2W is nearly universal. PS2, for instance, gets a lot of flak for being P2W. Little or no flak at all for the fact that a Year long vet, in addition to his vast experience in the game, is going to have some *very* pronounced advantages over a day1 newb. Tribes:Ascend has grinds for all of the items that could be fairly significant.

1366293495.0,316,self.truegaming,1clt1g,I spent the last couple months designing the best MMO I can imagine. I wrote up some details about it and I'd love to hear any feedback you guy might have.,ArdathanElite,521,205,138,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1clt1g/i_spent_the_last_couple_months_designing_the_best/,"(Edit: I can't believe that I wrote a 2000 word post and then wrote ""you guy"" in the title.)

By designing, I mostly mean thinking about it as I lie awake at night and scribbling maps, notes and charts to 
describe it.
 
In designing the game, I had a few objectives. I wanted a game with a dynamic, player-driven world where the residents are struggling to survive and each player's actions feels like it has significance and weight in an overarching storyline where they may only play a bit part. This world should feel alive and I don't think this is possible without death - not only for players but also for NPCs, cities, and entire game worlds.
 
I've been kicking around the name 'Last Nation of Man'.  
 
The story is set as a demonic horde threatens the last stronghold of mankind, the (quasi Greco-Roman) city-state of Ardatha, which is being overrun by refugee groups fleeing from the surrounding, fallen nations (which are,  basically, Tibetans, jungle Māori, and Mongols). The players must build a society robust enough to hold off the serious threat of being overrun by the demons despite the player base being divided into four nations which have a history of conflict. 
 
That's the premise of the plot, but what I'm really interested in discussing is some game mechanic ideas:
 
* Like Natural Selection, the main enemy - the demons - would also be player-controlled characters. The game would actually be two games which occupy the same game world. I imagine the MMORPG to be the 'main' game, but the other half of the game would be a 'free-to-play' action game that allows the player to control a demon. The players would be given points for disrupting human society and killing human characters. These points would be redeemable for weapons and abilities. They would constantly be spawning and be incentivized towards hunting players and destroying assets. The Demons would have full access to the movement and combat systems and would be roughly comparable to the capabilities of an average players. They would also have access to some abilities not available to players. There would be prohibitions about playing both the 'action' and MMORPG versions of the game on the same server. I think this would be a fun game mode and would be popular enough to consistently supply an existential threat which can only be countered with coordinated effort from the players. 
* Dynastic permadeath: There has been a trend in recent years to embrace permadeath as an enhancement to gameplay. The system in LNoM would be somewhat similar to the succession system in the grand strategy game Crusader Kings 2. When your character dies, his or her possessions would be transported to an appointed heir (which could be a blood relative or adopted heir). If the player's character dies without an heir, the player would lose their assets and have to restart as an 'orphan' character without family connections. A major goal of the game would be to procure and protect a family in order to ensure an heir would be available in the event of you death. Moreover, since you will eventually play as one of your heirs, you also must invest in developing their character through training and discipline. 
* Persistent world: When you log out of the game, your character does not disappear but instead converts to an NPC whose behavior is determined by player choices. While a player is offline, the character can continue to perform tasks such as mining for a resource or training in a skill. Alternatively, a player could hire out his character to another trusted players for the period you are offline. Much of the grinding of traditional MMOs is eliminated by this system. If possible, the game would cross platforms in that a smartphone app would allow you to control your character even if you are away from your computer. While this wouldn't simulate the same experience as playing the game, you'd be able to update your character's orders on the fly and respond to requests from players in the game relayed to you through the app.
* Combat system: The combat system is the area where I'm most unsure about the feasibility of my ideas. The main inspiration for the combat system is the 2001 computer game, Roboforge. In Roboforge, you would design a robot and teach it moves that it would execute under certain conditions, e.g. you could have the robot swing its sword in a certain manner when its sensors indicated the enemy robot was directly in front of your robot (give or take 10 degrees) and standing within 3 meters of your player. In LNoM, you'd be able to develop new moves in a practice space and test them in sparring matches. For a given starting positions, you would develop a set of two animations which could be initiated by the right or left mouse button. Groups of these animations would develop corresponding to a 'combat school' that has a complete set of movement choices that a player may need in combat. Players could switch between the combat schools there character is trained in on the fly in order to change their style to suit the situation. As you maneuver around a combat space relative to your opponent, you could choose to trigger one of the two combat maneuvers that are queued up for that situation. The fight plays out as a branching tree of choices of attacks and maneuvers. The player would have to be in tune with their character as clicking either of the buttons again or commanding certain movements during the attack animation would cancel it to start a new one; players would need to know which move to use in a situation, when to initiate it, and how to avoid disrupting their character’s movements. The system would also take into account your stance (which you could split between standing and crouching) and your movements (running at enemy vs. running past them right to left, etc) to offer you a different set of options for attacks based on your starting state. The real challenge is that the fighting system would require an animation/physics engine capable of handling damage based on the physics of bodies striking each other rather than on predetermined damage values. I'm excited about the engine that Wolfire Games is developing for Overgrowth in that it seems to have that ability to handle this and create animations that include physics. 
* Creating moves: The combat system is built by combining smaller animations such as thrusts, leaps, and kicks which can be strung together and combined to allow for the development of complex moves. Some maneuvers would allow for player input during the animation such as including a few steps to move your character into position before the strike. Additionally, the abilities of the character will be factored in to allow the character to be reactive during combat by, for example, designating an angle from which to be prepared to block attacks at a point in the move. It's difficult to explain concisely, but I do have a sense for how this would work and I think it could be a very fun system that could lead to spectacular fights. 
* Incentivizing political strife: The entrenched political elite of Ardatha are struggling to preserve their position in society despite the demons and refugees flooding across the border. The great families of the game struggle to control the Ardathian Senate in order to impose laws binding on all characters and enforced by the Army. They have to choose how they handle the integration of the other nations into their new society; an essential task if they hope to fend off the demons. Since think pay-to-play model is a great way to ensure that the general player base resents the power of the elite, positions in Ardathan society and starting wealth would be allocated by auction. 
* Player-built world: The game world will be built by the players. We've seen how people love games where they can build a world. The geography of the world may be rebuilt but players design and build the structures which occupy the game world. They also can build characters which will then be made available for auction at the beginning of the game. Instead of spending time on level design, I'd focus on developing a system which allows players to construct a world for themselves. In a way, this would act as a collective effort at base building like a TTS as players would be charged with creating a layout of structures that allows for both defensibility and easy access for characters undertaking essential economic activity such as tilling fields and mining for ore. Only Ardathans would be allowed to participate in developing the world before the game starts while other races would be allowed to build structures in game (and would have other abilities of their own which are unavailable to Ardarthans.
* Procedurally generated maps: The terrain and structures outside of Ardathan territory would be a procedurally generated. These areas would follow broad terrain type guidelines but would place player built levels on the map at appropriate places (e.g. an abandoned temple in the jungle). Chests could be placed in the game and randomly allocated loot by the game engine. You will have to be on guard for demons when you enter this no-man’s land as demons will be spawned nearby as you venture into their territory.
* Fully player-driven economy: The functioning of the economy would be totally player driven. Everything which an adventurer finds in demon territory is just raw material for a skilled craftsmen. Additionally, a hunger dynamic will make agriculture essential. Players would weaken and, eventually, die if they do not have food. The entire city could starve to death if the demons manage to destroy its farms.
* Variable technology tree: Scholars, mystics, and shamans must work to discover new abilities and unlock them for all players. The discoverer can choose to share the tech freely with all players, sell training to other players, or, perhaps, work to establish a monopoly in the area they make a discovery. Importantly, the power of the skills or items unlocked by a particular discovery and the mechanisms and prerequisites for making a discovery would be randomized in each iteration of the world. Each game would be a unique experience as strategies and skills developed in one world may be useless in another with different rules. Some discoveries may require simply the appropriate mixing of ingredients while others may require elaborate laboratories or vivisections of captured demons.
*Everything Dies: Every character will age and, eventually, die. A young warrior might be too old to continue fighting after only a couple months of playing. I think the knowledge of their character's unavoidable mortality will make the player more attached to their character, not less. Moreover, whole game worlds can die out; if the Demons manage to take and hold Ardatha, that game world disappears. Survival means holding off ever intensifying demonic attacks and any lapse in the defense could be the end of the gam world as we know it.
 
There are some other mechanics I'd like to implement related to gossip/publishing and social networks, political offices, the crafting system, as well as the back story of the game, but I’d like this post to be closer in length to a short story than a novella.
 
Just to reiterate, I'm in no position to make this game. I just wish someone would.
 
This game would try to find drama in the more basic levels of human existence. You struggle to feed and shelter your family. Once those basic needs are meant you may choose to devote your life to discovering the workings of the universe, developing a family business, plotting to overthrow the entrenched Ardathan powers, or leading raids to destroy demonic shrines on the border. The game would feel like a real place where events are constantly occurring and changing the gaming experience for the players.
 
I'd love to hear what everyone thinks about it. Do you think the game mechanics could work? Would you play the game?

Edit 1: I concede the point of needing a safe zone. How about having the players construct a home (or find a room in a larger building)?

1371540691.0,321,self.truegaming,1gkmf0,Creativity at Nintendo,LittleRudiger,532,211,342,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1gkmf0/creativity_at_nintendo/,"I may get downvoted like crazy for this, as Nintendo has its die hard following, but, I wanted to discuss it anyway. 

I'm a long time Nintendo fan, I love their games. But, I can't help but feel that the company itself has had a creative drain. There have been no new major IPs from Nintendo proper since around the time of Pikmin and Animal Crossing on the Gamecube. When people complain about the absolute mass of Mario games, it's not so much about the quality (which is superb as usual), but, the complete lack of risk taking. 

Someone on /r/gaming said that what does it matter if a game feels like Zelda and is dressed up as something different, but, I think it matters hugely. Nintendo's importance on storytelling, or lack there of rather, needs to change. I feel that the dependence on formula (particularly with Zelda, following a character from village to killing Ganondorf) might change if they allowed some serialized storytelling. Personally, Majora's Mask always struck me as the most interesting, and that's because Ocarina of Time covered the origin story. 

I'm happy with their gameplay, but, I feel like at some point story does dictate gaming situations, and by allowing some writing into the equation, they might come up with new situations.

Further more, as a creative type, Nintendo seems like the last place one would want to work; unlike current companies like Valve, Naughty Dog, Quantic Dreams, Nintendo seems unwilling to create new franchises or stories. And this is despite having a vast wealth of which many companies can't compete. I personally believe that Nintendo could achieve Pixar level storytelling in games if they ever actually attempted it with a serious effort. 

TLDR; Despite being richer than God, and attracting talent, Nintendo seems to avoid taking any risks with new IPs.

What are your thoughts? Is it just nitpicking and we should be happy with strong franchises despite their age? Is storytelling unimportant? Or are they getting a free pass where other companies (SquareSoft, Ubisoft, etc.) aren't? Hell, perhaps I missed some major IP's or storytelling, let me know.

1343271917.0,318,self.truegaming,x63ut,Are body counts in games too high?,mrmackdaddy,427,109,412,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/x63ut/are_body_counts_in_games_too_high/,"It's not a new trend, but lately I've been thinking about how ridiculous the number of people you kill in the course of a normal action game is. It's sort of at odds with being a good guy when by the end of the game you've killed over 300 men. 

In a straight up action game this isn't a big deal, but if a game is trying to present a realistic story with realistic characters it's a bit jarring. Take for example GTA IV: you play as Niko Bellic, a man who has come to America to get revenge on a man who betrayed him and got 12 of his comrades killed. So what does Niko do in pursuing this goal? Kills hundreds of people. By the end of the game I believe my kill count was around 600. Even if you avoided the wanton destruction that is one of the main draws of GTA, your kill count will be in the hundreds. To be honest, it's not really at odds with the story or the character of Niko Bellic that he kills men, but the quantity of men killed is just extreme. 

Some other games that suffer from this issue are Red Dead Redemption and Uncharted. Red Dead Redemption is similar to GTA where the John Marston is not exactly a good guy, but he is trying to redeem himself, by slaughtering hundreds of men. Nathan Drake in Uncharted is your typical good guy action hero, and apparently he does express the desire not to kill (I've only played the first) but you still kill plenty of bad guys. I feel it poses a particular problem when an important companion dies and the main character is supposed to feel righteous anger about it. Wouldn't the bad guys be just as justified in their desire to kill the MC given that he's killed dozens of their friends?

I understand that for games to be fun, you need a challenge and that typically involves throwing a ton of enemies at you and enjoying the game requires some suspension of belief in this regard. There are plenty of games that avert this by having you kill robots or aliens or the ever popular zombies. But it's also at some point a question of realism. It's not very realistic for one person to be able to so effectively kill that many people. The game Last of Us caused quite a stir recently for its more brutal and realistic depiction of violence. But I wasn't as impressed by the trailer because it showed the player go through and kill 7 men before the infamous shotgun blast. It was intended to be brutal and shocking, but I think it lost some of that because of the trail of bodies that he had left.

**TLDR:** A massive body count is often at odds with the story and characters of a game that strives for realism.

Do you think that this is a problem in games right now? Do you think people should try to fix it? Can/Should it be fixed?

Are there any action games that manage to be fun while limiting the body count?

1366138354.0,314,self.truegaming,1ch7zq,"When criticizing media, people tend to think STORY only refers to PLOT, which is only about a quarter of what the word ""story"" really contains.",RAA,460,146,103,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1ch7zq/when_criticizing_media_people_tend_to_think_story/,"I see this pretty often, and I’ve begun noticing many, err, *misunderstandings* surrounding the word and its usage. Ok, yes, plot is an incredibly important part of storytelling, but the word plot only refers to concrete physical events, timeline, and how it all unfolds chronologically. 

Take a peep at the [20 basic plots in storytelling](http://www.tennscreen.com/plots.htm). 

Notice that 20 isn’t a great number? How do these get varied with each new media? A fusion and mixture of other elements, sure, but it comes down to other aspects of what *story, the word* also refers to. 


Namely, *presentation of the elements of plot are just as important*. Within this broad category, we have **dialogue and linguistic type** (roman speech, colloquial, vaudevillian, slang, scholarly, etc), **character motivations and justifications** (why the character acts, how his/her personality plays into decision making, and their moral compass), and importantly the **immersion of environment, aesthetic, and tone** (how the story is encased and what makes it actually come alive, visually). 


These sections of dialogue, motivations, and immersive qualities make up the presentation of a story. They are, in my mind, considerably more important to the story than the plot itself. This hails back to the age old question in literature of: do you make interesting characters and fill in a plot for them, or do you make an interesting plot and guide your characters through? 


To utilize both presentation and plot is to create a spectacle that deserves much praise, but I believe that understanding their differences is vital to discussion and design of stories as well.


**TL;DR**

If we keep grouping all of the ideas of plot and presentation into just the word story, I fear we’ll be unable to truly regale or enlighten others with our criticisms and analysis.

Maybe I'm just too used to the TES world and lore, but I feel much more invested in this game's story than in any of the quest lines I played in Skyrim. The Witcher has me very impressed with the level of detail they put into the characters and story. I was initially put off by the amount of cutscenes in the game, but now I look forward to them and think they add a great level of immersion and character building to the story that I find TES desperately lacks. Also, even though it's not true open world, I still think it feels and plays like it is, but that's just me.

What are your opinions on this? 

I've never heard much about The Witcher and so I started the first game with literally no idea what I was getting myself into. Needless to say, I'm pleasantly surprised. I think this game deserves a lot more attention and I'm looking forward to getting into the second (and eventually third).

1348463020.0,310,self.truegaming,10do1m,On Torchlight 2 vs Diablo 3,Kaires,457,147,346,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/10do1m/on_torchlight_2_vs_diablo_3/,"I've played about 20 hours of Torchlight 2 so far and well over two hundred for Diablo 3 (though I’ve quit).
Graphically, Diablo 3 is indeed ""prettier"" and the animation looks better. The weapon glow effect in Torchlight did not look good, and the shining and glowing was overdone. Personally, I am a huge fan of steampunk, so I actually liked the Torchlight environment more, but I’m trying to keep this as objective as possible. The environment in Diablo 3 was much darker than Torchlight 2, and the graphics and music really added to the mood. Torchlight 2 had darker music and themes, but the color scheme and monster appearance really conflicted with it. 
Combat wise, Torchlight 2 is much more diverse. In Diablo 3, you could only have 6 skills at any given time. This was supposedly to create a more easily changed character, however the feeling that your character could do so much more had they been able to use the skills they should theoretically have makes Diablo 3 much less immersive.

In Diablo 3, stats were wildly oversimplified: If you were building damage, get critical damage, critical chance and your primary stat. If you were building defensive, get health and resistance. However in Torchlight 2, the stats got much more interesting. It was very difficult to decide what to add, all four stats are necessary for all characters. All characters have their damage and critical damage influenced by strength, critical change and dodge by dexterity, et cetera. While playing as an outlander, it was difficult to choose between Focus, to boost by poison damage and execution chance (for double pistols) or to boost strength. In any case, it makes for more interesting build types. 

As far as the campaign goes, Diablo 3 has an infinitely better storyline and much more detail and animation quality in cutscenes. However, Diablo 3 felt short, and repetitive. There is virtually only one way to play each class, and to fully level your character; you need to play through the game the exact same way four times. As well as that, the actual playtime of one run through is very short, and definitely not enough to justify the 60 dollar price-tag. It took me about 8 hours to finish the first time. Torchlight 2 on the other hand, has a much more complete gameplay experience, with side-quests and interesting exploration. Diablo 3 felt more linear (which in my opinion is bad for a dungeon crawler) and didn't cater much to exploration of any type.

Equipment drop in Diablo 3 and Torchlight 2 are wildly different. In Torchlight, the best equipment comes in sets and legendaries, which have constant stats, so there isn't a random factor when it comes to endgame equipment. In Diablo 3, there is a random generation of stats for the best items (including sets). Torchlight 2 rewards the player more often (as it should without an auction house), whereas Diablo 3 rewards more at once, but far less often. Both systems work well, as you can obtain good equipment via Auction House in Diablo 3. The only point I would criticize either system is that in Diablo 3, the Auction House prices were incredibly inflated due to gold botters/farmers.

Item enhancement in Torchlight 2 far outclassed that of Diablo 3. To enchant an item to full potential, I would need to run into a skilled enchanter in the wild (the ones in town can't enchant as many times), which is very rewarding (once I found it I nearly shat myself). In Diablo 3, item enhancement was incredibly shallow, some items came with sockets that you could put gems into (there were only actually 4 kinds of gems). The gem system in Torchlight 2 is more interesting, with a wide variety of gem choices to buff your character in different ways (as well as interesting side effects, e.g. chance to cast a spell on attack, et cetera).

Both games had a follower system. Diablo 3 used another person, whereas Torchlight 2, like Torchlight, used pets. The pet system was far more interesting. The pets had an entirely new inventory, and the player could teach them skills. You could also send it back to town with a shopping list, which was quite useless (since if you had a portal with you, you could just go back yourself). But the main thing about pets in Torchlight 2 was that they actually did something. When playing Diablo 3 I didn’t feel as though my follower was useful at all (the Enchanter provided stat boosts, but that’s the extent of it). In Torchlight 2, your pet can act as a monster magnet, to prevent you from taking all the aggro, whereas followers in Diablo 3 were so weak and squishy that it didn’t even feel like they were there.

One aspect of gameplay that Diablo 3 did better than Torchlight 2 was resources management. In Diablo 3, each class had a unique resource that they recharged and spent in different ways, managing resources in Diablo 3 felt good, and the charge/spend aspect of different skills made the gameplay feel smooth. In Torchlight 2, you had a small mana pool (even as a mage, you could only have 10 or so spells before running dry), and after running out you had only the option to either attack normally with whacks or plain shots, or run away until your mana was back (in the case of mages). There was the charge bar system, but that was only remotely interesting in the case of Engineer. 

I haven’t yet had a chance to experience Torchlight 2 in multiplayer, however I can say for certain that multiplayer Diablo 3 is quite mundane. Of course there is always the added fun of just doing something with friend/people in general, but the multiplayer itself doesn’t add anything to the game. PVP has still not been released (which is just ridiculous) and multiplayer dungeons are problematic because coordination or teamwork aren’t really all that necessary (even in Inferno). So long as you aren’t dying and still hitting things, you’ll do fine. This makes it essentially the same as single player.

Diablo 3 had a very shitty endgame. Inferno farming was boring and somewhat easy. The balance between classes was catastrophic. The stats weren’t flexible, and everyone regardless of many different play style, flocked towards two main stats: Crit and Resistance. On the other hand, Torchlight 2 had much more variety in dungeon generation, stat distribution and build types., which increases both the endgame fun of a character, and the replay value as another class or build. 

These of course are just aspects of the gameplay. Company decisions on DRM or item distribution also impact the games, however I’m not considering whether you “lag like a bitch” or the community is shitty, or if everyone thinks you’re a little bitch (it’s probably because you are by the way), this is just about the games themselves. I’ve seen many people posting about how the lack of DRM makes Torchlight 2 the better game, or that the only argument about Diablo 3 being a worse game is AH and DRM. This is meant to be an objective comparison between the two games.

It's an older but still an interesting discussion.  The quote in the title comes from the 3rd page, but I recommend reading through the whole thing.

I just saw a post saying that Battlefield 4 was coming out in 2013, and I thought that was really soon.  I decided to look up some information on it, and I found this from November:

http://www.examiner.com/article/new-battlefield-4-discussion-revealed

&gt;""Battlefield 4"" will apparently be a next-generation title, but will this be one of the last titles we see in the series for a while?

&gt;According to a report from CVG today, ""Battlefield"" executive producer Patrick Bach talked about some of the risks involved with creating a new Intellectual Property (IP).

&gt;""'Battlefield 3' could have been released almost as a new game because there are so many differences [between it and its predecessors].

&gt;""But the problem then is that players seem to want sequels, they like the next iteration of the game they love, and even if people say they want new IPs, when new IPs arrive no one cares, they don't buy them, so I still don't understand why people see it as a problem when they're part of, they're creating the problem.

&gt;""I would love for people to buy new IPs and prove with their wallet what they mean, instead of blaming someone else. There's a big chunk of money you invest in games so you want at least your money back,"" Bach said.

&gt;EA Labels president Frank Gibeau has also talked about the amount of new IPs that are coming from EA.

&gt;""I can tell you right now there's between three and five new IPs that we're working on that we're thinking about for the next-gen. Some of them might come to market, some of them might not,"" Gibeau said.

&gt;""Battlefield 4"" is scheduled to debut next fall of 2013 on next-generation systems.

1354676279.0,309,self.truegaming,14au2o,What is the best opening level to a video game?,DaMentalTeen,414,105,889,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/14au2o/what_is_the_best_opening_level_to_a_video_game/,"In any entertainment media, the opening must pull in the audience with such a way to spark interest without completely overdoing it. It shouldn't be the best part of the production, nor should it bore everyone to death before the rising action begins. It needs to nail that exact mark to quickly grasp the attention of the viewers without leading to disappointment for being too good.

For books, other subreddits have shown me Fahrenheit 451 and The Stranger had opening lines that made your eyes widen and say to yourself ""wow, this is something different."" 

For movies, I would say Star Wars: A New Hope has the best opener of any movie for immediately giving the audience the gist of what's going on in this whole new galaxy between good and evil without making everyone realize they just read an opener to a fairy tale a few seconds earlier.

For TV shows, though I haven't watched much shows, I would say Breaking Bad had a very efficient opening. Right away, the protagonist is in a horrible situation as he's driving in the middle of the desert with bodies and chemicals moving around in the back of an RV, only to lead to his final goodbyes to his family before he's allegedly caught or dead, all within the first few minutes of the show.

Now, for video games, I feel like this is a lot more complicated since the ""audience"" is immersed right away with the controller in their hands, or now with a remote or their own body, ready to command whatever the game has in store for them. There are more variables to account for in the opening of games in comparison to any other entertainment media.

When games first started, plot was not a big deal as long as the gameplay was fun and easy to learn. Super Mario Brothers for the NES had little to no reference to plot, an instant no-no with those expecting games at the time to be the next great storytellers; instead, the player had full control over this ""Mario"" character and found out certain activities and commands executed would lead to a higher score, punishment for mistakes, and ultimately, progression towards finishing the game. The first level to Super Mario Bros. can still be remembered block by block, pipe by pipe, enemy by enemy by veteran players of said-game just from how this style of immersion worked. Many gamers to this day prefer this style of an opener to games because of how well it can be executed: here's the game, enjoy.

A more modern (sorry for the pun) example that not many would consider of this kind of style is Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. Not the tutorial in the very beginning, mind you, but the first real level titled ""Crew Expendable"" in which you raid a ship in the middle of the ocean as a new member of the SAS. After fighting your way to the bottom of the ship, an enemy jet fires at you and your squad must then escape before being dragged into the ocean. Only after you narrowly get passed a broken catwalk, navigate through flooding hallways, and jump back onto the helicopter before slipping off a sinking ship on its side do you finally see the title of the game. Granted, this example comes from a franchise not much gamers consider very good at all in comparison to more recent games, but I felt this example connected best with the gameplay-style of immersion to get the player into the game.

As I said earlier, there are many more variables to consider in gaming. With better quality titles being released, the story and environment of games have been utilized to immerse the player into the game rather than the gameplay itself. The best example, I believe, is Bioshock. You see yourself survive a plane crash in the middle of the ocean, only to somehow find a lighthouse that leads to the entrance of the grand underwater utopia of Rapture, or what was left of it. During this, you could only move, look around, and jump. You never got to use a weapon until further progression, and later than that, your first plasmid. The game took its time instructing the player of the controls and what the objective was, despite never giving the player the freedom to do whatever they wanted to do right away. What made this style of immersion just as effective as the older model was treating the game as if it were fine wine. Letting the player slowly enjoy piece by piece of the game at a good-enough pace so the player never questioned what they were doing in a negative way without feeling overwhelmed of what they could do in the game.

A second example of the ""take it piece by piece"" approach is Mass Effect 2, a franchise famously (and infamously) known for its story and huge setting. it begins immediately with an attack by an unknown enemy able to find your ship, equipped with stealth capabilities. Similar to Bioshock, you can only move, look around, and choose a few dialogue options as your ship burns, even with you dying after the last of the crew escapes the wreckage. Again, despite the lack of gameplay presented right away, the player never feels restricted as the events in the game are happening at such a scale that if all mechanics were presented, the player would feel overwhelmed (something I felt Mass Effect 3 failed at, since it did exactly this). 

Anyway, since I've given a few examples of what I thought were good first levels and why, now I ask all of you what is the best opening level to a game? Do they have similar styles to what I explained earlier, or do you have a different opinion on what makes an opening level a great level?



TL,DR: Super Mario Brothers, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, Bioshock, and Mass Effect 2 all have wonderful openings for their own reasons.

EDIT 2: I'm not saying that all cutscenes are bad. I like cinematic games like Metal Gear Solid, Uncharted, and Heavy Rain.

However...

I know we are all conditioned to expect buggy games from Bethesda, but Skyrim is pathetically buggy.  The game feels broken.  A glitch here and there I'm okay with, just due to the scale of the game, but the fact is that some of these bugs occur the *majority* of the time.  The fact that Bethesda didn't fix these bugs, to me, sends the message that they just don't care.

Bugs I came across:

* When a giant strikes me, I fly 300 feet in the air.

* Sometimes when using a bow, arrows don't go where they're supposed to because of some invisible wall getting in their way.    

* Companions often block doorways, and are not intelligent enough to move out of your way.

*  Enemies fall through the world.

*  Enemies stop fighting fighting back and simply stand in one place while you beat their faces in.  (Poor AI)

* Animals get flung up in the air at random.

* I got off my horse and it just disappeared.  

* My companion is almost guaranteed to get lose while I explore.  

The new engine is a huge improvement over TES4 engine, but there are some things that they didn't improve, that I think should have been improved:

* I am still able to walk normally across a mountainside at an 85 degree angle.

* Ragdoll.

* Stiff/rigid NPC animation stuff (like when the prisoner attempted to escape during the intro of the game.  It felt very robotic (similar to when [Charon kills his previous owner](/spoiler) in Fallout 3).

Maybe I didn't take part in this Diablo 3 discussion, however, why where gamers so gentle with Blizzard regarding their ""feature""? I remember when Ubisoft put into AC 2 everyone wanted their blood. It was a huge discussion and eventually they gave up on this online connection thingy. Today was the first time I came across an Petition for an offline mode in Diablo 3 (by the way I don't own the game yet because of this particular ""feature""!) and not many people signed it though I read rage about those (in)famous errors that contain this 3 and a 7.

Maybe you people can help me out. Why do we allow Blizzard to force us go online? I can't remember a good reason. And please don't go back to those filthy pirate argument. Seriously, the pirates are wasting their time playing the game right now or at least trying to play it.....

Everyone else who did read through the whole text but doesn't want to take part in a discussion, well, I wish you a nice weekend. Don't drink and drive. The cake is a lie - always!


Edit: Thank you reddit. I appreciate every answer I've read so far :D
For those of you who want to enter the discussion: Maybe you'll try to focus not on those two companies to much. Ubisoft was a bad example I guess but it was the first one that came to my mind. Additionally I feel sorry that I used the word ""allowed"". ""accepted"" would've fit a bit better.

I don't want to answer every single post of you (though I appreciate those and I wish I was able to take the time and actually do answer to every post). Here is a quintessence of what I read so far:


""Ubisoft did it as part of their DRM, Blizzard did it against hacking""
I see your point here. But seriously what is the difference? I accept the fact that D3 is heavily focused on a multiplayer experience thus there is a need to fight against hacker. From a meta-like perspective I'd say it is still some kind of DRM because DRM in our days prevents you from using various modificators like trainers, etc.

""People like Blizzard""
Double-edged sword eh? Some people are satisfied with what they have. It is okay i won't say anything against it. Personally I would still stand up against things I don't like. Imagine your boss at work likes you very much (not THIS much...) but some day you will do something that is not appropriate. Your boss might say something like ""Oh this could've happened to me, too"" though in other cases it is more like ""Yeah, you fucked it up!"".

I found this [article](http://science.howstuffworks.com/life/choose-options.htm) on howstuffworks (I know, not very deep), saying that:

&gt; an abundance of choices and information may make us falsely believe that the stakes are higher than they really are regarding the outcome of our decision [...] because we are presented with so much information, the overload of options and data leads us to falsely believe that, even a fairly mundane task like shopping for toothpaste, has great significance than it really does

Further,

&gt; what we may regret most, according to Schwartz, is the extra time spent analyzing and comparing each and every bit of information, which can lead to frustration and fatigue, ultimately diminishing our decision-making ability.

Note that the article actually refers to decision-making in everyday life, not video games. 

Now I know the easy solution within a gaming context would be to say ""fuck the sidequests, just do the main story"", but games often reward you for the sidequests, in fact often some side quests are totally intertwined with the main story. I'm not a completionist nor an achievement hunter, but still I feel like I need to play some of the sidequests in games that give you the option, for a myriad of reasons even aside from perceived or assigned value.

1363728192.0,297,self.truegaming,1amao8,Simcity 2013: The breakdown,I_Use_rot13,448,151,105,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1amao8/simcity_2013_the_breakdown/,"With over 3,000 1-star reviews, SimCity Limited edition actually holds the title for the WORST rated product on Amazon. Ever. Why is this? What could possibly make a game this much of a flop? Maxis has over 20 years of in-house research from previous iterations of the game, ~8 years of user generated content for sc4, and ~5 years of serious competition from other city builders/simulators. At the same time there have been countless research publications in the field of urban planning and city analysis. all of the parts are there, so what could have gone so terribly Wrong? 

The first, and largest problem most users and non-users noticed was the Always-on DRM, which was deceptively lied about and called essential to the functioning of the game [A claim EA and maxis have now retracted after being exposed as liars]. This was a pretty big shitstorm on the internet, but It's mostly passed for most players as the servers have come back online and while many people still have issues with losing internet connections, there are now offline play patches on the pirate bay. I won't beat this dead horse. Instead I will focus on the actual game itself:

PATHFINDING - Pathfinding is absolutely the first and most noticeable failure of the iname mechanics. Pathfinding is not too complicates, It's been done in 2d, 2d, 3d for DECADES. SimCity's team should have had a great deal of expertise in this area, even if traffic was statistically generated completely in older sim games. This is one of the core elements of ANY city. How do I get to work? How do I get home? should I take the subway or the car? Will the highway be more congested than the smaller road? should I hop on the turnpike for longer drives? Pathfinding in SimCity.
Sims do not even calculate Shortest-distance roads correctly. Sims Re-calculate their route every few seconds, so if they change their route and 3 secodns later there's an obstruction two miles down the road, they will recalculate a new route and turn completely around, which leads to sims wandering roads for days or getting stuck in infinite traffic loops. 
Sims also have a STRONG Right-turn bias. If given the choice between three paths of identical distance through the middle (one zig zagged, one left, one right] The sims will choose the right road regardless of road density type or the amount of traffic ahead of them.


Traffic - There's no subways. Vehicles will occasionally permanently stop in the road blocking traffic forever. You will most likely have to bulldoze that strip of road to correct the problem. Even if sims get to work by public transit, Work buildings still attract additional car traffic from people who don't work there for mysterious reasons. Public transportation also generates no revenue.
The game also needs More freedom in creating your road network (overpasses, proper tunnels, the option to determine what crossing gets traffic lights maybe?)

Road construction: The game needs More transit options such as half intersections, one-way roads (multiple lane support), toll roads, subways, elevated rail, bus lanes (avenue bus stops should be offset to not interfere with through traffic), bus rapid transit lines, intracity highways (official, not modded), multiple city entrance points (traffic balancing, comes with intracity highways), NA/EU/Asian road styles, culdesacs, unbalanced roads (2+1 roads), different types of road material (plain asphalt instead of dirt, colored brick roads), roads with turn lanes, turn-only lanes, walking trails/bike paths (with a park system that utilized them), road/walkway flyovers/flyunders.
Land Area: A SimCity city is approximately 1.2 miles square, this is ridiculous. There are many suburbs in the real world that span a larger area than this. 

Absolutely idiotic Sim AI and behaviour - -makes planning a city like you would expect a city to function completely impossible. This is a problem so bad that I really can't sum it up in this post, but Planetaska over on Reddit has spent countless ours studying Sims in the New SimCity and is working on an ongoing series detailing the behaviour of Sims and vehicles and problems with them.

Population calculation: After you hit around 500 people, Each home begins adding more people to the population than the number of people who live there, although the count is correct under 500 people. Apparently after 500 people you start accumulating ""ghost"" sims. They do not work, they do not live anywhere, they are not simulated on roads, they do not pay taxes, but they still contribute to the costs of your services. This causes artificial inflation of the stated size of a city and makes growing larger cities impossible. Regardless of this being a bad thing or not, this breaks the GlassBox promise of a 1:1 ""What You See Is What You Simulate"" simulation.

Land value - high desirability should not just be triggered by parks and civic buildings. SimCity COMPLETELY disregards factors like proximity to rivers/lakes/beaches, Terrain type, Forested/not when it calculates land values. It also mostly disregards population density and wealth of sims in a region. I want elements of the landscape itself, such as nearness to the shoreline, to add value. Makes no sense to have shacks on the waterfront and mansions in the center of town that happen to sit across from city hall in high crime zones. Similarly having a clean river should confer bonuses to land value while Polluted rivers confer detractions. 

Ground textures - Ploppable objects, like parks, have grass which is coloured in this rich, deep green. Undeveloped land has a hue of a much brighter green (or brown). Why the fuck? They look stupid next to each other.

Plopped objects - Ploppables intersect with sims can trap sims permanently, making them useless and causing larger bugs because sims are mostly handled statistically rather than as individuals. 
You're also unable to build ploppables on top of fences, barrels, crates, or other scrap leftovers from previously demolished items which were never cleaned up. If this is supposed to be a feature, at least implement a city cleanup service crew which patrols the city carrying off this waste.
Overall it'd be best to see more Ploppables on the whole like Grand central stations, Taxi Hubs, museums, military installations, private schools, churches, cemeteries, seaports, marinas, docks, golf courses, boardwalks / beaches, toxic waste dumps, state/federal prisons, courthouses, etc

Property shape/no autofill - Ungainly wedges form when placing anything on an angle or a curve. These inscribed spaces yield unusable land, making it functionally useless to ever place anything but straight and gridded structures. So, the only remaining reason to stick properties on irregular angles would be the aesthetic value - which is then hampered by the unappealing boundaries that occur between land and property. Either make the land in these wedges usable by reducing the cover area of the stroke of the roads and objects, or provide an autofill like automatic placement of objects associated with your city's theme in that space

Regioning: The region system is hopelessly broken. Besides the fact that cities are only directly linked in four-city clusters for game interaction purposes, City to city trades are late, slow or not occurring at all. Furthermore, Upgrades to the great hall do not confer benefits to the other cities of the region as they are supposed to. 

UNDOING MISTAKES - There is no way to reload older versions of your game to undo big mistakes. There isn't even an option to restart a city from scratch. what the hell? At least give players a planning mode. Real urban planners don't plan now and demolish and try again usually, they plan out their work on paper or computer simulations before building it, so that they can actually see whether an idea would work. 

Player/Regional Accountability - the ability to grief a region by bankrupting cities or mess with other players by polluting upwind is an absolute menace. During the beta previews, we were told that if a player stopped playing it would not hurt your game experience, but the reality is that other player's cities can have devastating effects on yours. This is just one more example of the terrible nature of the regioning system. 

Resource scarcity - this is the most instantly fixable thing I can think of. Ore shortages might make a bit of sense in a ""fuck you, it's realism"" sorta way, but it makes mining specialization somewhat pointless (keep in mind, some mines have been in operation for thousands of years in reality). Water supply diminishment is the worst example of this scarcity, and rain is scarce beyond any realistic scenario. Are all Sim cities built in deserts covered with fake trees and astroturf? it is entirely ridiculous and will ultimately doom a city. This can be alleviated by placing a pump near a sewage treatment plant, But it is also mentioned that the treated outflow goes back into the water table (rather than the pipes, which makes little sense), SimCity 4 and 3k had handled this perfectly by actually using the water grid laid by the player. Why was this broken when all of the logic to do this correctly already existed? Meanwhile Oil supply of ""1 month left"" can last several years and doesn't ever seem to hit zero. 


Statistics availability - How many commuters exist citywide vs. bus capacity? How many workers exist in that building? SimCity is extremely disappointing in providing useful, meaningful data for players to make decisions based on. Another big loss is the lack of graphs and charts of vital statistics like net congestion in traffic or industry or commercial stats over the years or months. Had Maxis created an accessible modding interface and toolkit like Bethesda has done in the past, players could do this themselves, but this is not the case. Etc. etc.

Emergency services - Partly as a result of the terrible pathfinding, and agent AI, Most people have by now noticed that fire stations respond very unrealistically to emergencies [Oh, you have 10 fires around the city? Let me send 20 trucks to one fire]. I want the option to flag emergencies for police/fire/rescue vehicles a la tropico. 
Service Vehicles Drive in packs as well, reducing their efficiency and wasting time.

Unrealistic development rates - If the density of my city would not sustain or justify a skyscraper, I don't want to see one yet. If I'm bled dry for workers to fill new jobs, don't keep spawning industrial buildings. For that matter, why are commercial structures appearing at all if the demand for them is zero?

Employment/industry - Unlike earlier sim Games, Industry in SimCity is almost useless. A city with zero industry can perform perfectly without any unemployment issues, Industrial areas DO NOT ship to the harbour or to your commercial areas. Sims also have a strong bias against industrial jobs. Furthermore, Shoppers are counted as workers while they are shopping. Workers similarly stop being workers when they leave their job. 

Specialisation of workforce/production - This is closely tied to the issue of the next problem. There's very few specialisations for workers to take up (Agricultural, military, Administrative, textiles, etc), and very few practical things your city can produce for sale [Computers seem to be ridiculously overvalues]. Why can't you combine meats and processed foods into TV dinners like you can when producing processors? There's very little attention to detail in the network of exchange involved in an economy. 

NO JOB PERMANENCE - this is quite possibly one of the BIGGEST flaws in the game. Sims do not keep the same job from one day to the next. If you follow a sim in his daily routine, each day he leaves home and gets a new job at a new building which he finds an opening at. What the hell is this? Who's idea was this? Why do they still work at Maxis. this is a problem which contributes to the pathfinding problems because as sims have no Fixed job from one day tot he next, there is no cached path from their home to their job, so the computer has to calculate a new preferred route, Each. and. every. time. 

Lack of useful, satisfying problem-solving methods - This is the new SimCity. They could have done so much more on the creative side to handle our mayoral troubles, y'know, like the original Maxis did? How about this: 
1. Traffic woes? If you have a university with the superconductor upgrade, you can research the flying cars project. 
Or - 2. Ground pollution, you need the recycling center's de-soiler poo-poo repurposer. Cleans up surface muck and produces great fertilizer for your local farms (by the way, farms). 
3. Labor shortages? Play bad mayor and gain a little ""ostensibly-legitimate help"" in the form of a stream of overseas workers. Play good mayor and research the robotic assembly line project. 
Why should the game stick us with challenges and no way to address them? At the very least this is an area where simple access to the game for player scripted mods would have allowed the community to fill very quickly. 

No ordinances/edicts - I want to initiate public policies with real trade-offs in the form of virtues vs. consequences. Recycling mandate: Citizens are required to sort their garbage into llama-proof recycling bins (bins themselves non-recyclable). Approval -%2; garbage yielded -15%. Or, same ordinance, city-funded sorting. -$700.00 per day; garbage yielded -15%. If an ordinance provides ONLY benefits to the city (super-ez tax forms: +1% approval, +0.5% residential tax income) then let it be a reward to mayors... instead of getting gifted with do-nothing microsoft-style achievements that no one cares about and don't actually represent any achieving.
I can't be the only one who would prefer In-depth and additional economic options and ordinances. Options like requiring drivers have ""licenses"", taxes on imports/exports (instead of just dumping all the money to the city), commercialize city services, etc.

Modifiable service and civic buildings -- that fundamentally look the same - I want to see new skins. Variants, styles, colours. Yellow hospital. Tudor police station. Because i said so. More modification snap-points should be made to the upper floors of these structures as well, so as to make them potentially taller. Wider. As is, the city hall moddability is pretty cool, as well as the elementary school's.

Parks - They're shit. It'd be much better to give people different ""elements"" like swing sets or little rivers and bridges and terrain tools to create different parks which appeal to different Sim demographics in different degrees. At least offer small puzzle pieces to mix and match to make bigger parks dynamically. 

Terraforming utilities [or lack thereof] - The game is missing them, it shouldn't. Doesn't have to be full god mode, but being able to grade an area for development or develop a canal system between residential neighborhoods would have been nice to have.

Stunning lack of variety in city events. 

Working educational system - High schools and elementary schools should be required. Their coverage would then affect a drop-out vs high school graduate metric. Can't afford them? You're going to have a shitty-ass set of schools with shitty-ass students. Think institutional shack-and-brick where you rape student families for hot lunches and prom tickets. As to Colleges and Universities - their placement would impact the percentage of higher-ed graduates (obviously) which would have a direct effect on industry type, wealth demographics, protester types (fix protests!) et al. Also, we should have the ability to set tuition and fees which would also affect graduation rates. (Too expensive, fewer graduates.) Again, statistics. As it stands Education is an incoherent mess, and student sims are also nomads like their parents. 

Road-laying difficulties - Draw roads around a building imperfectly -- and prepare for weirdness in the form of giant odd loops, irregular positioning, or an absolute refusal to meet perpendicularly. When a player has to do incremental measurements, it's annoying. Roads should snap to structures as they do grids, and make it easy to continue in a 90 degree manner around buildings. Cross-roads are also tirelessly fussy when it comes to forming intersections if the existing road-ends aren't perfectly aligned. Or they intersect at bad angles. Solution - Roads should have a ""snap-to"" key, such as shift, which communicates the will of the player for ""straightness"" which conforms to the shape of structures and which would also fill in any gaps from roads you intend to intersect that happen to fall a bit short. 

Dynamic city changes only partially implemented - Noticing the solar panels appearing on some structures within ""green"" cities, you start to get your hopes up about the depth of the game engine. But wasn't there supposed to be pink neon for ""gaming"" cities, gritty industrial appointments for ""dirty"" cities, etc. etc.? Are the solar panels really it? What happened to the rest of it? How about changes to roads, signs, or anything else that might convey an identity to the work you've done? this was one of the cooler features a lot of us had been looking forward to

Buildings require Roads. Always. Roads can't be deleted unless the resource they're attached to is deleted. So if you want to remake a service road you have to delete the utility it connects to. It makes it a fucking nightmare when you want to re-road your city, because you end up deleting hundred of thousands worth of buildings, because you can't just leave them there for 1 second while you change the road to an avenue. You cant even leave room for road upgrades for later.

The Mayor Should be Corruptible - As far as I know, among simulation-type games, only Tropico ever embraced the idea that what’s good for the people and what’s good for the omnipotent ruler are not always perfectly aligned. Tropico rewarded you for building a successful economy, but it also rewarded you for stealing money from the treasury, making back room deals, imprisoning your rivals, and otherwise enriching yourself at the polity’s expense, or sacrificing some of the population for the good of the whole. This is one of the elements that's made tropico so much more plausible from a political point of view than SimCity

The Game Should Ask Deeper Questions of Environmental Consequence -
In general, SimCity has never asked any questions about what the land was like before your city took root. Empty space contained trees, it’s true, but otherwise very little was lost when you built a giant new highway interchange or industrial park. Meanwhile, although pollution has existed, there are only two kinds of pollution: “air” and “water"". In today’s world of environmental controversies and citizen activism, the standard SimCity approach seems more and more dated and simplistic.

It would be better, and socially responsible, if the game could ask and answer mature questions about greenhouse gas emissions, light pollution, noise pollution, and other forms of city-impact. Also, it would make the game more dynamic if the city planner had to occasionally fight environmentalists to gain access to new land, or on the flip side, to restore wetlands to protect against storm surges, or battle deforestation to prevent landslides. For that matter, previous versions of the game made natural disasters totally random. In reality, the city planner should have a pretty good sense of whether an earthquake or a hurricane is a more likely threat, and this should inform municipal disaster preparations

All the Mass Effects, Assassin's Creeds, Dead Spaces and more, never played.

To make myself feel like I'm not just hoarding games and wasting money, and to simply better myself as a gamer and broaden my horizons, I've tried playing more of them recently. However, I run into the mindset of ""I have to finish the game to get my money's worth/the full experience, or else it will sit in my 'unfinished' group and in the back of my mind forever."" 

In some ways where a game is essentially absent of story, this usually isn't a problem for me. Like if I stopped playing Peggle halfway through, I doubt it would bug me since it's just different levels. However if I stopped playing Thief (1) right now, a few hours in, to play some more recent game, I feel like I would lose interest, forget about it for a while, and it might come back to bug me like ""oh yeah I never finished that"" and for some reason I'd feel bad. Either because I didn't get the full experience, my money's worth, or whatever.

The point is, sometimes I have no really compelling reason to finish a game, even if that game is really good, like Thief or Deus Ex (1), but I would feel bad for quitting. As a result I'm going through a lot of games all at once, slowly, and trying to rush myself in finishing them to reduce the stress of ""oh no, so many games I have unfinished/unplayed.""

Why do i see quite many people wanting hard games? Or more challenging games? I simply cannot graps my mind around why harder is better...if i got the choice to be all powerful instantly or weak, i would obivously choose powerful. Now, someone of you would most likely say ""you would feel better knowing you worked hard for it."" Really? Are people honest when they say that? If i could choose between working for money or getting it...well you know what i would choose.

I play all kind of games, but this popped into my mind when trying raids in WoW.

Ok, discuss! Go go go! Want to hear your opinions!

1364661999.0,296,self.truegaming,1bb4ae,"Difficulty to enjoy older titles due to mechanics, graphics and support.",UltimaKaiser,430,134,335,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1bb4ae/difficulty_to_enjoy_older_titles_due_to_mechanics/,"Hey /r/truegaming, reading through much of /r/gaming /r/games and this subreddit I often see nostalgia posts about how people are going back to their old favorite games and enjoying them heavily. Additionally, I see many gamers enjoying older games on older platforms that they never played today. Content producers like the AVGN are very popular and many people go out of their way to play through old games.

For me personally, I just can't play older games for long periods of time. I installed Morrowind a while back and attempted a new playthrough. Morrowind is emotionally my #1 game of all time. Unfortunately, I couldn't stay interested in the game. The graphics were a real big turnoff for me (remembered them very much better than they actually are). The mechanics of such an old game were not helping as well.

I wonder, am I alone with the problem that I just can't play older games? It really strikes me as weird, the only game that I actually would prefer the predecessor over the sequel is Dragon Age: Origins. Apart from that, I will always get bored or annoyed with a game that isn't younger than 3-4 years. The problem is, I can't even put the finger on what exactly turns me off from playing them.

The problem intensifies when I change platform. While moving I found my old Xbox and Halo 1. After moving I hooked it up and tried to play Halo 1, one of my most played games during my teenage years. I just couldn't get immersed in the story, because graphics were detracting from my overall enjoyment.

An even better example for this would be Mass Effect 1 and 2. I think that Mass Effect 1 and 2 are better in storyline than ME3 (they mucked up the Reaper story so hard imho) and I even liked the way you progress through the story better (I didn't like the readiness mechanic at all). Still, if I would decide to play a ME game now, I would start ME3 not ME1 or ME2.

Another great example could be SW: KotOR 1 and 2. KotOR1 is in my top 5 games of all time, I loved the game at the time. I finished it at least 5 times with several different choices and playstyles. I have KotOR sitting in my steam library, recently I installed it using all the PCGW tips to get it to work properly. The story just couldn't keep me interested again, because mechanics and graphics were such a big turnoff. Somehow the magic is gone from back then. I cannot reproduce and sort of immersion. My immersion feeling is not even generated at all or constantly breaking due to looks or how it plays. KotOR 2 on the other hand, many people favor over KotOr 1 (never played it, because I didn't have a system to run KotOR 2 at release), but I cannot play it. Can't even got past the first level. It feels like a really big book that I cannot get through the first 100 pages to get invested enough into the story/characters to stick it out.

Anyone have similar problems or explanations for this?

1332000655.0,298,self.truegaming,r0waz,BioWare in full PR damage control. A professional's take.,MyCoolYoungHistory,436,138,233,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/r0waz/bioware_in_full_pr_damage_control_a_professionals/,"Here is a post on BSN regarding BioWare's response by an individual who worked in the PR realm.  


&gt;I don't think Bioware is out of touch with their customers though I agree with an earlier poster that right now they are assessing their options. Nor do I think that everyone speaking up for them at the moment is a ""yes man"" or shill. That said:  


&gt;I don't for a moment think there are any other endings, this was a hallucination, etc. Bioware/EA is letting these speculations go on for two reasons. First, they are letting people vent. Secondly, they are weighing options.
Years ago, I worked for a PR damage control team and everything right now is going by the book. First, re-affirm and ignore (also known as doubling down), then try and define the detractors in the mainstream with things like ""this is all a big mistunderstand"", etc. while remaining civil in the hopes the detractors go rabid. Meanwhile go dark and use countermeasures through third part sources to prop up your position and brand the outcry as driven by hacks, haters or a minority trying to wear out the detractors on these outlets or ""shock troops"" while protecting the corporate core. Next, offer something distracting (notice SWTOR is free this upcoming weekend) known as the ""faux olive branch""/ask the angry people to explain their concerns (without agreeing to commit to a compromise), buy more add time (definitely going on right now), and hope it dies down. If the pressure is still on, determine the economic viability of 1) ignoring the outcry and banking on the fickle nature of consumers to get over it or 2) determining if we can make money off of fixing it.  


&gt;If it is any consolation, the decision whether or not there is a fix DLC, etc, won't be made by the writers so illusions to things they wanted to convey don't matter much atm (to wit: the leads comments yesterday). I suspect he's been called in and politely told by the PR guys to not do that again. This is now a corporate problem, not an artistic struggle with fans. Somewhere in the EA bunker, attorneys, PR guys, writers and brass are sharing numbers b/c in the end this will come down to hard currency.  


&gt;As one who despises the endings, I'm hoping the suits tell the visionaries that the customers are loud enough and numerous enough to swollow their pride and get them out of this storm. For those that love them, I readily accept your position and respectfully disagree.  


Later he posted:  


&gt;Greetings All,  


&gt;First, I’m flattered someone would repost this. Many thanks.  


&gt;A couple follow-up thoughts for those wondering what is likely going on with the other side of the mirror in the last couple days:  


&gt;First, Operation Goliath, the free Star Wars online weekend, and the recent noncommittal overtures to listen are faux olive branches. Sorry. Customers intrinsically want to believe companies they patronize listen and when they stop believing that, the company has to say they are listening and do anything to get the detractors off-message. There are a dozen names for this, but the most memorable was ""The Shell Game.""  


&gt;You will know that there’s a genuine need for dialogue in the corporate bunker when the message turns from “we’re listening” to “we acknowledge we may have a disconnect with our consumers and are willing to discuss a meaningful solution to the problem.” It signals an end to non-committed deflection and opening genuine talks to solve the problem (it’s knows as “Exposing Your Throat” btw). At present, you’ll notice Bioware/EA has only said they will “explain” the endings. That’s not a give, that’s a delay tactic.  


&gt;But here’s the part that amazes me as an old PR guy and is totally new. The disenfranchised base here is changing the old methodology. It’s akin to comparing old-style bunker PR defenses to new blitzkrieg-style consumers. To date, the “bunker strategy” was always used because it was virtually foolproof. However, social media and the 24 hour news cycle have simply changed everything. Twenty years ago, you could not mass 30,000 protesters into a networked base without some luck, money, a GREAT cause and (most importantly) time. By the time you did get organized, folks were either burned out or lost interest. Groups like Take Back have altered the landscape and suddenly the contest is taken from the old paradigm to a crazy new (and wonderful IMO) place. Preorder sales took away customers biggest weapon in the past (i.e. don’t buy the product). Now customers who feel they have received poor value have been potentially re-empowered by the internet. Bioware/EA is feeling the full brunt of this thing while passion is hottest. They are deploying countermeasures faster than the old strategies ever would have ever suggested. To some degree, they are being outmaneuvered atm. But now it depends on how long the protest/outcry holds up.  


&gt;Two more quick points and I’ll close. First, the Child’s Play movement was brilliant. Notice over the past few days how some of the most visceral detractors to the outcry have had to shift their vitriol from “you’re spoiled selfish haters” to “sure you gave to charity, but you are spoiled selfish haters.” Nobody is drinking that Kool-Aid. Better yet, some outlets are now saying “maybe the game has problem but its still art” from the precedent message “best game ever.” That won’t fly with the mainstream. If its one thing they know is that when “art” hits the marketplace, it is a commodity, nothing more. You’ve changed the countermeasures from ""unbiased"" critics of the movement into drum beaters simply trying to get you angry. EA’s PR guys probably envy you (grudgingly) atm.  


&gt;Second, don’t buy the only X people voted in the poll out of 1 billion customers, so they don’t care. That’s bunk. Are there ""drum beaters"" on both sides of this issue that just want to see controversy, sure. But if I was sitting in an office looking at that Bioware poll, I’d be reaching for a cigarette.  


&gt;Finally remember, they have much more data at their disposal. They know how sales are going, how much time people are playing that are synced into Origin, etc. They will watch those numbers this weekend. If sales slow, watch for price cutting within 10 days (just over the two week US release date). It will mean that retailers are getting nervous and will slow new unit orders. As I’ve said before, this will come down to hard currency. If the protests start having an effect on that front, the response will come.  


&gt;I’m an older gamer and again appreciate the repost. To everyone (on both sides) continue to let your voices be heard. You are consumers and have every right to engage in this discourse. The boards being locked yesterday proves someone is watching and knows this is an issue. I'm in the hated-ending camp to be sure, but I admire everyone one of you who is arguing for what believe on both sides!  


&gt;Cheers.

I've always felt a huge dissonance between the games industry's lockstep depiction of war-as-blockbuster and the truth of ""modern warfare."" As Yang points out, war is now *invisible,* and

&gt;The danger is not someone going out to shoot a school or impulsively join the army; the danger is that these games are affecting how we think of war in a decidedly misguided way, and that pattern of thought affects popular support of real-life wars that actually kill people.

I'm not trying to say that we should all make frowny-faces at military shooters and criticize anyone for liking them (though this article has certainly catalyzed my personal opinions about this genre), but I would have serious respect for anyone who took responsibility and tried to made a game that depicted war ""ethically."" Do you think that it would be possible to make a game that cleaves close to the reality of war-- economics, media, occupations, all the little ways that societies change when they take part in a war? Yang thinks that Civ games come closest to this, since you've got to deal with the effects of war on an entire society.

Players seem to often complain about visibility during night in games, but I see this as invalid.

What is the purpose of night time in games? 

- 1: Is it to limit visibility making the game harder?

- 2: Is is an atmospheric choice to add to the tone of the game?

- 3: Is it to add variety to the setting giving players a different experience?

Games don't have to settle for one of these, and in my opinion games that include all 3 of these are better for it.

Recently, I installed the latest version of ICEnhancer for GTA IV which many of you may know, is a graphics mod. The lighting changes, perhaps unintentionally made visibility practically impossible without lights. At first I thought about making some changes in the Mod's settings, until I realised the game was better for it.

Liberty City was transformed into a dark sprawl where safety is found in the small radiuses of the street lighting. The neon lights of the club district gives colour back to the game infamous for having none. Liberty City is far more beautiful as a result, and firefights with the police are more intense too. The Mod made GTA IV a near perfect blend of all 3 points.

But then there are games like Battlefield 3, which seem to answer to none of these points. The map Tehran Highway is one of 2 night maps in the game and the least played by the community. Instead of making gameplay harder or adding variety, the map is a blue mesh example of the complaint against the game's filter. BF3 fails at making a good night mode. Night vision scopes are near pointless and the atmosphere is the same as any map.

Rising Storm has a good night map, Guadalcanal. Is is harder to spot enemies and the lighting from the jeeps adds to the tone of the map. The atmosphere is intense as you feel far more vulnerable to enemies sneaking up on you.

When night comes in DayZ, most players seem to leave the server. Visibility is impossible without NV goggles or flashlights. This is coincidentally, my favourite time to play DayZ. Those with goggles are essentially playing Predator with the prone survivors with flashlights. I think DayZ/Arma does a good job of adding variety and making things severely harder. Gameplay is genuinely very different. But players seem to miss the concept and simply abandon it.

For some super-quick back-story:
Rumors of this game surfaced when it appeared on a Brazialian ratings site in the beginning of March. The original Farcry 3 writer even suggested that he was working on something slightly off the beaten path. By appearances, Ubisoft might have intended to slip this one in under the radar when they released the trailer on April 1st. Eyebrows would be raised when the game’s composer, Australian duo Power Glove, uploaded three cuts from the game’s soundtrack on to music-sharing site Soundcloud later the same week. After that weekend Ubisoft released another trailer as well as a release date of May 1st for all the platforms in its target demographic. It's since seen an early [underground](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_84XGrVJOaTo/TAqSxP28CKI/AAAAAAAAAsc/DkKTTGGt7zE/s1600/ALESTORM.2.jpg) release due to a mishap on Ubisoft's Uplay service and was sucessfully launched last Wednesday.

If you've played Farcry 3 then you're going to recognize a lot. You’re on a small series of islands covered with enemy compounds that you can take over to use as your own personal safe house. In fact a great deal of the game is just a re-skin of the original, and sometimes it’s not even that good. Cyber Cassowary anyone? But the extent of the re-design is far, and the result is a strong, unified art style. Anything worth anything is a cyber something. If it’s not black, it glows. Bright red and green beacons against a perpetual night skyline like some kind of dystopian laser-tag arena. Soldiers wearing full-face helmets with black leathers and there’s not a motorcycle in sight. I think you can see where this is going.

The call-outs to 80’s action movies don’t stop there. The moody synthesizers, building beats and industrial percussion of the game’s main anthem are a tribute to the original Terminator in a ‘just different enough that we won’t get sued’ sort of way. Snarky action-hero banter is exchanged as the primary form of communication and is delivered by none other than [Michael Biehn](http://www.michaelbiehn.co.uk/graphics/gallery/terminator/terminator33.jpg) of classic 80's action fame. The techno-babble is hilarious, the jokes are cheesy, and the shame is nowhere to be found. While the game does take many opportunities to ‘clue-in’ the player on the gag, the story makes enough sense to come to a reasonable enough conclusion despite it’s own twisted logic.

In contrast to the artistic license, there’s a very childlike nature at the heart of this game that genuinely brought a smile to my face. In the opening mission, you’re shown how to raise and lower a base’s defensive shields; doing so queues a deep AI voice announcing “MEGA SHIELD OFFLINE” in a way that one might do when raising the bed sheet to let your best friend into the couch fort of kick-ass. Firefights between Omega Force (motorcycle thugs) and scientists (nerds) look and sound like nerf/super soaker battles (what with taunts like ""You suck at this!"" going around).  This same immature, childish fun is even found in the weapon upgrade system when you discover that you don't have to pick and choose upgrades for most weapons. Nay, in most cases you get ALL the upgrades.

Much like the original Farcry 3, completing certain objectives will unlock different upgrades for different weapons. That’s where the similarity ends. An early upgrade for the sniper rifle makes bullets explode hard enough to take out most small craft. The assault rifle can be upgraded to shoot lasers instead of bullets, and your shotgun will look like an abomination when you’re finished adding barrels to it. The removal of the skill tree system can be jarring for returning fans of the franchise, but it's replacement gives a gradual curve of skills and abilities over the course of the short game allowing the player to focus more on combat, exploration and the hilarious narrative.

All in the space of one month??

And it's becoming an annual tradition now with nearly every big game of this generation having been released around this time of year.

And then there is nothing for at least April!! I mean January/ February are usually ghost towns with barely a big release and the summer is usually devoid of most major releases as well. 

Why do they do this? Wouldn't it not make more sense to spread things out? Why are they ""fighting"" over which game I spent my cash on when I would have gladly bought them all had they released them one by one throughout the year... It's not like there's some force stopping me from buying games in July!

It wasn't exactly the graphics, although they were good for an MMO at the time, but the amazingly well crafted world that is Azeroth. So many different zones like The Barrens stretching wide through Kalimdor that were the home of a thousand leveling people or the clash of factions in Hillsbrad Foothills, bringing end-level characters to gather in a low level zone just to battle each other.

To be honest, I did not purchase the game at launch. I waited a year before acquiring it, mainly due to the payment model being expensive for a student. However, once I started playing the game, I quickly realized that the $15 that went off my account each month, weren't exactly a waste, because the entertainment value I got for those fifteen bucks, far exceeded anything else. Who would ever pay $10 for a cinema ticket when WoW offered an entire world to explore at $15?

Speaking about attraction, the MMO still stands at around 7.7million subscribers. This may be counting the Asian versions as well, which aren't the same payment model as then Western versions, but having that massive amount of players so many years after the initial launch definately speaks that this game has been the most successfull game in history. I know Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 sold around 15-20 million copies, but when you pull the statistics from Steam to make an example; just about 15.000 concurrent users are playing it (It was around 750.000-1.250.000 on PC alone, which is around the same number that play on private WoW servers).

All numbers aside, all down to earth: Will we ever see an MMO that provides the same attraction as WoW did?

With gaming, I have noticed the same trend. Most of the time, I am an invincible death machine with guns and grenades who can mow down anything in my path, and should rightfully fear nothing a game can throw at me. The worst it can do is throw cheap jump scares at me to make me close my eyes and spin the controller wildly holding down the triggers for a brief second before its gone.

Can a video game be truly scary or mentally degrading without resorting to making the weirdly shaped monster jump out of a shadow at me? Or is the point of a video game to be a hero that can't really be hurt or destroyed? Are there any games that really shy away from the jump scare and focus on your mind? I have played the usual fare that people suggest when I have alluded to this topic, Amnesia, Silent Hill 2, Condemned, Dead Space. Dead Space and Amnesia were quite solid and worked on atmosphere for awhile before introducing enemies and jump scares. While Condemned had combat, you weren't an invincible death machine and it built a good environment that could wear on you after awhile.

An example of this could be Alpha Protocol. Bug-ridden, uninteresting environments, flawed mechanics, clunky controls, the unfinished nature, the convoluted and trite military plot. 

Expecting a good Mass Effect alternative or even a more realized world along the lines of Vampire the Masquerade, only to be met by a generally poor experience. 

And then it hit me. The dialogue sequences. The degree of choice and impact of decisions. Pure role-playing. Admittedly a forced role but once you accept it, great fun. 

The most recent for me (and inspiration for this topic) is Dead Rising. Ever since it was released I've had my hands on a copy for brief and distant intervals. I was so intrigued by the concept that I was trying to force myself to like it repeatedly. I was tantalized particularly by the Infinite Mode which I still have yet to unlock due to the games daunting difficulty and frustrating gameplay.

It's so user unfriendly. A game literally only comprised of escort missions, which involve escorting some of the worst AI I’ve ever encountered. Clunky controls, timed gameplay, aggravating boss fights, untimely walkie talkie transmissions from Otis. The only redeeming thing was the status saving every time you restarted (which is incredibly often).

I picked up another copy recently and I finally understood it. It's an arcade throwback. A masochistic game if you will. It's meant to be restarted repeatedly. You have to develop a rhythm; strive for a perfect run through. You retain your knowledge of direction, and strategies, and item locations, and even your status upgrades to achieve that high score. An amazingly satisfying experience. The perfect Groundhog Day game.

* In Sonic Generations (PC), they actually allow you to choose which monitor (in multi-screne configs) you display the game on (full screen).  Thank you...it even actually works!  I've only encountered this a few times out of hundreds of games.

* Allow functional alt-tabbing in an out of the game

* Set a mousing 'border' around the screen when in fullscreen mode (this is for us multi-monitor folks) - about 50% of the games I play do this right, the rest fail miserably.

* Let alt-f4 quit the game immediately (and don't make me go through more than a couple key clicks to normally quit and save....some games require me going through 3-4 menu/screens to get out of the game, with mouseclicks plus keyboarding required...not acceptable)

* if you're on PC, make your menus work with mouse, keyboard AND the 360 controller. I'm tired of games that make you switch from the dominant game controller (e.g., using mouse only) to use something else to change menus, start a new game etc.

* Be clear about what 'voice' volume does - is it controlling in-game voices? voice for mp chatting? And for games, such as AC:R, stop having 'music' control the entire voice levels in cutscenes.  

* Music volume should refer to the volume of background music, not ambient sound in the game that are important

* My plea for a new, should be simple feature: a volume control for weapons sounds....when I have a gun shooting for 75% of the time, the noise gets irritating, drowns out everything else, and bugs the neighbors or damages my hearing (in headpohones) if I turn up the volume enough to hear ambient/environment noises.  I've found that, in L4D1/2 for example, if I drop the weapon volume to about 10% of normal for each weapon's .wav file, I cna still hear them perfectly clearly, but I can hear and appreciate all the other sounds in the game as well.

* subtitles (most games do this now, but a lot do it poorly)

* Please let me adjust music volume, especially in the menus - from the opening screen/setup....AC:B - you make me go into and play the game to change volume...and that ""Entering Animus"" soudn effect makes me want to kill you.

* work with multiple monitors please - as in respecting their edges when necessary (as above), and as in allowing their real estate to be used for things like map screens, and other information screens/feedback.

* Allow scaling resolution...yes, I'm looking at primarily ports here...

* Allow selection of which audio devices to work for which purpose.

* label in the multiplayer area exactly which ports need to be opened for everything to work (and specify which for router and windows firewall)

* work without issues on 64bit windows, and with more than 2 or 4 GB or ram. It's time.  For that matter...make 64 bit versions that load themselves into available memory and/or use all that ram if it can speed anything up, save load times etc.

* Have reasonable DRM/no DRM if you can't do things at least as effectively as Steam.  

* Where possible, stats. People like the stats, even for stupid things like 'how many lightbulbs you shot'.

* don't show me doing things in cutscenes I can't do in a game.

* no invisible barriers that I can't walk through/climb over ... if you don't want me going there, create a realistic reason/barrier/etc. for that.  It's logical and enhanced immersion in the game.

* nobody likes cutscenes that randomly have you have to hit a mouse button/random key combo to do something (edit: quick-time events) ... either let me play, or let me watch a cutscene...I don't need something to make sure I'm paying attention to an overly long cutscene and it doesn't make me feel like I just killed or dodged that huge beast/attack/boss etc....this usually involves a cutscene outside the normal physics of the game anyway.

* Have a consistent, predictable physics throughout the game

* don't make me watch an unskippable cutscene or tutorial - ever.  Always leave a way out/to skip.

* adjustable FOV in any FPS genre game. Seriously, people get ill over this and can't play games when the FOV is too narrow for their monitor size/viewing distance...not everyone plays on a TV across the room where 60degrees may work...

* be smart about resolution changes/scaling...and don't screw up all my desktop icons, especially in a multimonitor world.  (I suggest a program called ""Desktop Restore"" which I've found works great for multimonitor setups)

* add lan mode back in for those that need it

* local / standalone servers when and if at all possible and a valve-style means of matchmaking.  None of the automatchmaking systems work, and create serious issues in finding a match as the online community slows down

* editors. Let us make maps, change colours, sounds, etc. if possible.  Again and again, games that develop a community through allowing editing seem to survive and remain popular much much longer than those without.  

* unlimited save games 

* .ini files to let me adjust anything you don't want 'noobs' fiddling with (e.g., extreme resolutions, monitor choice, fov)

* if you're going to break with a gaming convention, make sure it actually works with real-world users (public beta test) and isn't just fulfilling the wish of a designer because it looks cool/pretty, reminds her of her dvorak keyboard layout because it's scientifically more efficient.

* In 3rd Person shooters such as AC, allow me to switch between 3rd and 1st person please, not just to view an area statically, but while actually playing the game

* if D turns me right, always make it turn me right, don't sometimes make it move me right (and vice versa)...and once again, I'm looking at you AC series and other console ports

Obviously I've gone on too long...but what do you think about for these things I think should be part of almost every game (where applicable)?  

What would you add/do you think should be standard in this day and age?

As an old school RTS gamer who fits pretty strictly in the armchair general mold, this trend has been a frustrating one. Dawn of War, a game of epic, explosive battles for territory, became Dawn of War 2, that had more in common with DOTA than the [Grim Future Where There Is Only War.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warhammer_40,000) Starcraft 2 was little more than a graphical update for the first game for fear of upsetting the people for whom Starcraft had become a familiar sport.

So I have to wonder; is this what people play RTS games for now? Instead of being games of strategy, have they become an exercise in rote memorization of game mechanics, damage values and clicks per second? Is this all we can hope for in future RTS games, or is it a fad that will blow over as e-sports become more mature?

Is there any hope for the armchair general?

""The official explanation for why arcades are dead in the West is that the consoles killed them. This is what most people will tell you.

But if this is the only reason, then why are arcades in Japan still alive, and in certain genres (fighting, shooting, rhythm) even thriving and leading the way? Consoles mauled arcades in Japan too, but they didn't quite manage to kill them dead. Why is that?

Some of the more knowledgeable people will have an answer to this. Arcades are still alive in Japan, they will say, because of the way cities are laid out, with game centers to be found in every sizeable neighborhood, next to coin laundries, subway stations, etc. Students and salarymen have developed a habit of going to the arcades before and after school or work, and during breaks, and they are the ones who sustain them. In the US, in contrast, arcades are usually in malls in the middle of nowhere, forcing people to go out of their way to reach them.

For those of you that need a refresher, alchemy was one of the seven skills that made up the magical arts. It was how you made potions and poisons in the game. By collecting flowers, fungi, herbs, and other organic materials the player was able to make potions and poisons for almost any situation.

What you may not know is that most of those ingredients have real world counter parts. From Dragon's Tongue to Lady's Smock to Stinkhorn to St. Johns Wort, the ingredients for most of the potions and poisons in the game were made up of real plants. Not only that, but their abilities are (loosely) related to their real world properties. Nightshade for poisons, lavender for healing, ect..

An interesting side effect of playing an alchemist is that I am now able to recognize dozens of different herbs and fungi in the real world, and I know them by name. I can walk through the forest and name many of the plants that grow there simply because I can recognize their in-game counterparts. Not only that, but I am able to remember the real-world uses of many of these herbs and fungi.

1340803362.0,284,self.truegaming,vom5r,DayZ: Still not the game I'm looking for.,,483,199,287,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/vom5r/dayz_still_not_the_game_im_looking_for/,"So, I really tried to lilke DayZ. My expectations were really high, like all previous apocalypse games attempts. I thought I finally found ""the one"" game. If you don't mind, here's what I find is wrong with the game concept of DayZ:

- It feels more Battle Royale than a zombie apocalypse. Whether you like slow or fast-paced zombies it does not matter because the zombies almost have a secondary role in this game, where they punish you if you make mistakes. At the core, it's still PvP, wether you like it or not.

- Exploration is boring. Same buildings over and over all over the place  and 90% of them you can't even enter. That was the big turn-off for me at the beginning. I was running away from zombies, heading towards a house I thought I could barricade myself in. Nope, I just died because it was an actually fake house. This totally killed any immersion I had within the first 10 minutes of my first play. 

- Zombies are boring, too. They're really just dumb moving obstacles. There's no variations to their pattern. There's no random events (ie hordes, or whatever). Personnaly, I find that fast zombies was a bad choice for the game. It would have been way more interesting to have thousands of slow-moving zombies than a handful of fast ones. It would have added tension to the game, where as right now, if I'm spotted, I know I'm dead and all I've got to do is run until the zombie glitches. (I know thousands of slow zombies is probably impossible with the Arma2 engine, but hey, that's not my fault. I'm just pointing this out.)

- There's no goals. There's no motivators for players to continue to play. Oh, yeah, sure, you can have better gear. But ultimately, for what? Kill more zombies? PvP? Even when you have the best gear, what are you supposed to do with it? I mean, the zombies ARE infinite, after all... Which leads to my next point:

- There's no interaction with the environment. If you could manipulate somehow, build stuff (think minecraft here), grow your own crops, create barricades, repair houses and whatnot, then players will create their own goals (minecraft again). Societies could form, alliances could grow, bandits would finally have a reason to become bandits after all. Now, THAT's the kind of game I'm looking for! 

- Realism. For a game that boasts realism, it's pretty bad. I know the Arma2 engine was chosen because of that, but gameplay-wise it sucks hard. I'm not talking about all the glitches, either, or the fake buildings that you can't enter, or the unplayable dark nights unless you're super-equipped. It's all of it together. The absolute lack of interaction with anything, the weird game rules you have to accept blindly, and on and on... It screams ""GAME"" in my face and I cannot suspend my disbelief.

THAT SAID,

DayZ is a step in the right direction. I did some ground-breaking things for the genre and I'm sure each iteration will be a little more polished than before. Unfortunately, it's not the game I'm looking for, and I don't believe they can achieve it with the Arma engine. What do you guys think?

[edit] Before anyone points out ""it's still in alpha"", I believe the core concept of DayZ is flawed, if it wasn't clear enough.

1375449779.0,275,self.truegaming,1jk90c,Do review scores say more about the perceived popularity of a game than its quality?,RomHack,422,147,203,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1jk90c/do_review_scores_say_more_about_the_perceived/,"I think a lot of people around here lead with the opinion that review scores are pretty pointless and whilst I agree I've been thinking more about the reason why this is.

Simply put: The final score a game reviews will say more about how the reviewer thinks that game will be received by everybody else. It isn't a reflection of how they themselves think of it. In fact, I don't see much personal authority being placed on games at all. A reviewer should be an expert but people reviewing games don't have any real set of standards; they merely want to praise everything because they know that's what people want to hear.

In an industry where an AAA game must do harder to get panned than get good reviews, it seems that whether reviewers are aware of it or not they are hugely favourable to games which they know are going to find an audience. You pretty much know which games will get high scores before they even come out. I'm not saying some scores aren't earned/warranted but it's mostly play by numbers. I keep waiting to hear a reviewer call a game banal, over-done and unoriginal and have that be the bearer of their opinion but it doesn't happen. Likewise I keep waiting for higher standards to appear so that 9 and 10 out of 10 games are actually stand-out games, not merely pretty decent.

Whilst series do naturally get better over time, it seems that the numbers only go up and up. Review scores for games rarely deteriorate. If Call of Duty: Black Ops 5 does nothing different than Black Ops 3, as long as it still has an audience, it'll get high reviews despite being a really unimpressive game by its own standards. In any other medium that'd be a 'haven't we done this before? think of some new ideas' scenario. Not in gaming, and I'm drawn back to the popularity factor as a reason for this.

The only contradiction I can think of exists with relatively unknown games: Indie and Mobile games. Here, they are often new IPs with seemingly no bias about their popularity...or are they? Despite many being nothing more than capable time-wasters we're seeing a lot more 7 and 8 out of 10s for these games. How can somebody think that's warranted? They are impressive but pretty average after all. Well it seems that the known high rate of people likely playing these games has coincided with a higher range of scores for them. This is exactly the same problem as the AAA one logically speaking.  

We've been here so many times and I hate to bring this up again but it's such a big flaw that it's really hard to overlook. I do wonder if reviewers realise how bad they actually are at what they do. If you ask a random assortment of 10 people on the Internet how good a game is, you'd probably get a more mixed reaction than from 10 (popular-source) reviewers. 

Games are fun, usually if not always. Their enjoyment factor should be unnecessary to point out every time unless it's actually not enjoyable at all (though I'm sure some still found Aliens: Colonial Marines a fun time-waster). Despite this, reviewers hinge their entire review on it. The more enjoyable a game, the more you perceive it'll find a big audience and the better it ends up being reviewed in most cases (I stress most).

What do you think? Perhaps I'm being harsh but at the very least I think there's a genuine problem with the lack of personal opinion being shown in reviews. I could have gone into some greater detail and backed it up with examples but everybody knows that a trip to Metacritic will show you what I mean.

1321554429.0,279,self.truegaming,mfx4f,On r/Games.,docjesus,406,127,254,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/mfx4f/on_rgames/,"Hey gang.

By now, you will be aware that there's another main gaming subreddit, called [r/Games](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games).  It allows link posts, and will be more heavily moderated than r/gaming.  I'd like to use this opportunity to give you my thoughts on what this means for truegaming, and also to give the newer members a bit of an introduction.

First of all, truegaming was never meant to be a complete replacement for r/gaming.  That should be clear from the lack of link posts.  There are two groups of users on Reddit: those who come here for links, and those who come here to take part in the comments.  The casual users outnumber the commenters by a large majority, which is why easy-to-digest content is upvoted a lot more.  truegaming was meant to be the place where those who wanted to talk about things were free to do so without being buried under shitty content.

Therefore, it's a necessary feature of this subreddit that it offers no link karma and moves comparatively slowly.  Initially, it was to remain small also, but word got around and here we are with almost 20k subscribers.  Downvotes hardly mean anything here.

The result of all this is that the community, for a change, essentially moderates itself.  AMV and I hardly have to remove any threads.  All the shitty ones are downvoted thoroughly before they can even make it to the front page, and even in that case, because we move slowly, those no-hope threads still exist in new for long enough that the poster will get some replies.

In other words, the power was within you all along.  You don't really need mods in a place like this, because since very few threads break 100+, the few among you who vote actually affect things.  I assumed that all threads made it to the front page on the strength of a couple of upvotes because we move slowly.  Not so.  Just check the new queue, there are a lot of posts that disappeared without a trace.  That's your handiwork, truegaming, and it only took around ten people saying ""No, this isn't what should be on the front page.""  10 out of 18,000.  Your vote counts.  The evidence is right there.

This works out for me, because I don't like being a moderator.  Not because it's a lot of work (it's not), but because I don't like telling people what to do.  Occasionally I need to put my foot down, but I feel bad doing it.  All those comments you see, they're not made by a machine, but by a human being.  I don't like telling people they're not good enough to hang around.  The sidebar, well, I'm looking over it again and it seems a bit harsh.  Lord knows I'm not going to start banning people for minor transgressions.  But it sets the tone.

In other words, this place was created with the specific intention of requiring as few set rules as possible.  If you think about it, there's a spectrum of attitudes towards moderation - those who believe everyone has a voice, and those who believe rigid control works better for the community at large.  I consider myself further toward the former than most, because I have faith in people.  Once they stop acting how they feel they're supposed to act, and start being honest with themselves, people are generally all right.  Sure, they might be a little boring, but hey, who's not guilty of that?

I guess I could put it this way: truegaming isn't meant to be a supervised play area.  It's meant to be a place where human beings come to talk about games, and you really can say whatever is on your mind.  The only real stipulation is that if what you want to talk about is what r/gaming talks about **all the time**, you're probably better off going to r/gaming.

I have seen people call truegaming 'stuffy'.  I wonder if there's some truth to that.  Not everything has to be an essay with references.  It's just... you know, another conversation about CoD?  Really?  That's all you want to talk about?  Also, people say that you can't post things about news or about a cool link you found.  Not true.  You can post whatever you like, but it should be with the intention of starting a discussion.  We don't function as a link aggregator the way Reddit normally does.

Just to wrap this up, r/Games - it's a good idea.  I've subbed, you should too.

*PS -* Oh, and to those responsible, could you please stop downvoting everything DinoFarmGames says?  Reddit is the last place I thought I'd see people getting offended by a differing viewpoint.  When it's 'politically incorrect' jokes that you find funny, people are dicks for being offended, but when someone has the gall to view games differently from you, all of a sudden **they're** the dick?  If you just like to play games for fun, that's fine, but if you're taking part in these discussions is probably because games mean something to you, like they do to me.  If games mean something to us beyond mindless fun, then we need to treat them with a little more respect, and that starts with the knowledge that everyone has a different experience.  Everyone.  It doesn't make them right or wrong.",,False,,t5_2sgq6,False,,,True,t3_mfx4f,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/mfx4f/on_rgames/,moderator

That sounds great… too great?",nothis,382,103,111,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/wazr4/valves_new_greenlight_announcement_for_steam_lets/,"This thread is intended to discuss the possibly negative aspects of Valve's approach, there is enough praise already. But here's a quick run down for those new to the whole thing:

Here's the official announcement: http://steamcommunity.com/greenlight

It takes a page from the Steam Workshop playbook and applies it to the games submission process which Valve must get *hammered* in. Their policy so far was to never tell rejected developers *why* their games didn't make it onto the platform, a common practice for services like Steam but sometimes weird (as even more well known indie devs such as [Cryptic Comet](http://www.crypticcomet.com/blog/?p=752) got rejected which left a lot of people puzzled). 

Greenlight will let developers promote their games in a public preview process, with descriptions, pictures, etc. and without having to go through Valve for approval. Every Steam user can then judge the games presented and whether they consider them worth a place on the store page. The games with the most positive response get a spot. So far so good.

**But…**

I was a bit skeptical from the beginning but [this post over at /r/gamedev](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/wa870/steams_new_greenlight_system_for_indie_games/c5bqldz) highlighted (literally… all those bold words!) the reason this could be bad for Steam and its status as a ""seal of quality"". Basically, there are games with quick appeal but not much depth to them. Think of the [fluff principle](http://paulgraham.com/hackernews.html) having destroyed /r/gaming *through democracy* by easy-to-judge average content trumping out hard-to-judge quality content simply by being more popular. I think that's an interesting problem and worth discussing.

Even just *making* it on Steam used to be a badge of prestige, something you could not expect but had to work hard for. Games had to have a certain depth to them, not just be ""fun"", which is why there aren't a billion Angry Birds clones on Steam right now. That leaves the important front page open for truly great games and allows them a good spot to compete next to AAA games. If that quality control is gone, there's a danger of the front page being spammed with $1.99 ""Extreme Zombie Tic-Tac-Toe"" indie games, completely drowning out games like Dear Ester.

Hopefully this game, as well as Blood Dragon, will be the start of the the move to full that gap. 

These two games have the gameplay of a AAA title, close to the visuals and polish of a AAA title, and cost about 75% less. The trade off of course is length, but that is not really a bad thing. I am part of a growing population of gamers that have less and less time to spend gaming.

Not only do I lack the time to finish most AAA titles in under 3 months, I also have other things vying for that time. Back when I was younger I spent most of my free time at home gaming. Why? Because there was nothing else to do. If I didn't like what was on TV at that specific time then I was shit out of luck and had to go play games. Now days I can watch whatever I want when ever i want, and that has a lot more of a negative affect on gaming for people like me than we think.

I get about 3-4 hours a week free to do whatever I want, mostly in 1 hour blocks. When I think about these 1 hour blocks I want to make the most of the time. I could play a AAA game, but I likely wouldn't get anywhere in that time, and if I do play it, it will take months to finish at that rate and it probably wont hold my interest for that long. I could also catch up on all my shows, something that can be done in that hour block. 

Games like Call of Juarez: Gunslinger are the perfect thing to fill that time. I can make good progress in the game in that time, and I don't feel like I am missing out on any of the AAA experience. I can still finish the game over a couple of weeks, so it holds my interest for the whole play through.

If I want to enjoy realistic handling in a racing game, I'm stuck on a boring race track with games like iRacing and rFactor, playing realistic races with realistic rules.

If I want to enjoy a fun setting, like drifting along the sides of a mountain or illegal street races, I'll have to stick with simple arcade mechanics and handling in games like GRID 2 or Need For Speed.

While arcade style racing games have often been mixed with a realistic setting, like real race tracks, I've never seen the opposite - simulation games putting you in a ridiculous setting, driving a Ferrari on a narrow dirt road, capture of the flag around abandoned factory, driving under trucks Fast and Furious style. 

Is there no market for such games, do all the simulation fans want to stick to their Circuit de Monaco and are all the fans of drifting and open street racing prefer their speed boosts and driving assists?

Are simulation engines so limited to regular race tracks that a steep dirt road along a mountain just wouldn't work?

I think games are the ultimate tool for escapism. Often when I'm driving IRL I'm dying to try sliding a corner, racing someone or speeding heavily, but of course I won't do it because I'm bound common sense and law.

I can get home, hook up my steering wheel and pedals and start driving fast, but I have to do it on a race track, not the kind of conditions where I wanted to do it in the first place.

Alternatively I can start Burnout, Flatout, Need For Speed or other such games and do all the ridiculous stuff, but not really get the proper sense of driving.

With devices like Oculus Rift coming out, it feels like so much missed potential to not have a realistic racing game where you can do all the crazy things you can't IRL.

During the wait for the standalone, scripting is now at an all time high - to the point where gear that once took weeks of dedicated searching is now available off of the closest dead carcass.

The supplied anti-cheat, BattleEye, is effectively null against such incursions. Bohemia seems unable to fight back, citing the initial nature of Arma II - the code is necessarily open to allow customization among the sim crowd. Without a standalone client it is virtually guaranteed to continue ad nauseum.

Personally I quit DayZ weeks ago. Even understanding the alpha status, it was difficult to continue playing after losing a 2 week character to a hacker who was trying to recreate a popular youtube video theme (thunder dome). I wasn't willing to let it happen again.

In a similar vein, there are a few older games I would like to play online occasionally but am unable to because of rife, un-policed cheating.

It's easy to say 'cheating is bad, don't let it happen.' This is quite obvious. But what questions can we ask and what other lessons can be learned from this, and similar experiences?

- How much of the nature of gaming predisposes people to cheat? Games have taught us how to optimize, bend rules, and find the trap door.
- What is the balance between draconian anti-cheat measures and a full on free for all? Should some grey area be allowed?
- Should multiplayer games with obvious security vulnerabilities be released at such an early stage? Does the early growth in awareness for your game outweigh the internal problems that could be created? Is it too much to trust the growth your creation with unvetted players who don't necessarily have your game's best interest in mind?

I'd like to hear what truegaming's gripes about Steam are.


Personally, I hate the fact that I have to authenticate with Steam's servers to play any of my Steam games, including single player games. 1mbps connection shared with 6 other people, not to mention crappy ISP that may or may not allow me to connect, makes it almost a dealbreaker if not for the sales and TF2.  Yes I know that there's an offline option, but it usually fesses up.


I'm also against locking games out to a single account. This is perhaps one of the reasons why I try to avoid buying digital and go physical instead. As a student, I don't really have much of a budget for video games. To solve this, I usually just swap around my games with friends. On consoles, this is possible as the media itself could be passed around. Not on Steam. If I, say, wanted my friend to play my Steam copy of Portal 2, I'd have to give him my account details and would have to log-in to Steam. This effectively locks me out of my other games while he's playing it. True, he can log out afterwards but there might be an occasion wherein he'd be forced to re-login into my Steam account, forcing me out immediately. I like how the PS3 handles game sharing, allows up to 5 authorized devices to run and download any content from a single account. So if my Steam account is authorized on someone else's PC, that means he could run any and all of my downloaded games.


On another note, I do hope Valve begins to offer more reasonable prices to everyone. I feel that, from what I read all the time, Australian prices are around $100 for a new game. However, they do have a somewhat higher standard of living and wages. Compare that to people like me living in a third-world nation, where a 40-hours-a-week job couldn't get you half a game due to the prices. This perhaps just contributes to the large amount of piracy around here, not to mention why grindy-Korean F2P MMOs are popular. People simply can't afford to buy games.",,False,,t5_2sgq6,True,,,True,t3_l1tuq,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/l1tuq/so_what_dont_you_like_about_steam/,

Even though modern games obviously paint a better picture of the world, the fact that it's so much more credible seems to make it mundane. Perhaps the limited technology required developers and artists to choose between totally bland and totally surreal, but the worlds they made always felt so unique.

I certainly get the impression that the fantasy worlds of older games were just more... fantastical. Can anyone provide any counter examples? Could this just be the result of gaming trending towards more realism? Or does anyone else think it's possible that older graphics simply left more to the imagination?

**Edit:** I've been criticized for failing to post an analysis of what makes my statement correct, due to misguided attempts to present an open idea rather than just my opinion. Though I offered the possibility that all this is the result of nostalgia, I certainly wouldn't have posted if I genuinely thought that to be the case. My point here is not that games from my childhood were infinitely better than modern games. The idea I was trying to put forward was that the constraint of using simplistic graphics necessitated a more stylistic approach to painting a game world.  The point has been made below that there are several modern games (especially indie games) that still operate under that constraint. My point, specifically, is that having worse graphics, or even no graphics (see Dwarf Fortress) can induce the imagination to paint a deeper picture, or at least entice the use of more vibrant/engaging color schemes. In short, I'm arguing (since it seems I must) that while modern focus on graphics is the equivalent of modern photography, older games were more akin to paintings, which benefited from not being enticed to draw inspiration entirely from the mundane and real. Even modern fantasy/sci-fi games, especially AAA, ultimately feel grounded in realism. I'm arguing that since titles have been, generally speaking, more focused anti-aliased dirt rendering, the industry has shot itself in the foot by creating bland worlds that don't allow for the same fantastic immersion than the old ones did. My point is that games should be less like photographs and more like paintings, embellishing the key details beyond reality and letting the imagination make up for what cannot be perfectly portrayed -- To that end, low-fidelity graphics are actually a benefit to the game as a whole.",,False,,t5_2sgq6,1351037546.0,,,True,t3_11yz6y,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/11yz6y/were_dated_graphics_better_for_immersion/,

Naturally, my friends and I decided to use the home row.  It just made sense.  

Suddenly WASD is king of the hill, everyone uses it, games come with it preconfigured.  How did this happen?  I've been trying to come up with the advantages.

WASD over ESDF:  

 - closer to bigger buttons (CTRL, ALT)
 - stretch advantages: easier acronym (what is ESDF? EDSF? WERD aren't even the keys), more separability between mouse and keyboard, less access to other buttons to confuse people

ESDF over WASD:  

 - easier access to more keys
 - natural home key position  
 - muscle memory to numbers, function keys, typing in chat  

It's such a hassle to change all the keys in each game, some games that I don't play more seriously I just try to live with WASD.

But I don't think it has to do anything with the advantages/disadvantages.  Most people never even thought to use ESDF and were just spoonfed WASD by Thresh and then game devs.  However, I think if no one knew of either systems, naturally people would think of ESDF because it's where you type.

Most of the voted comments consist of a lot of wishing that the company would fail, falter, and otherwise implode. This is one of the most common statements from the 'substance' gaming subset, and it is an amazingly common sentiment.

It got me thinking, as it always does when I hear these comments: what exactly do people have against Activision? Aren't they free to just not buy the game? Nothing is being forced on anyone, so where is the controversy here?

I'm not championing Black Ops 2, per se. I own the game and have my own issues with it, but never for one second do I blame Treyarch as though they tricked me into purchasing it. I know what I'm getting into and I'm fine with that. I enjoy the game and probably will have it as part of my gaming pantheon in the year/two years to come, alongside games like EVE, Civ IV, MW Online, and a slew of others that I enjoy.

Analogy: I don't particularly like Mountain Dew, but I'm fine with people who do. I never thought, ""Damn, I hope PepsiCo goes down the drain for their monopolization and watering down of the citrus-flavored soda market. Everyone who buys it and drinks it is just a sheep of Big Soda."" I don't care what your soda preferences are. I'll sit over here, drink my Virgil's root beer, and we'll both agree to disagree about what tastes better.

Whatever, I guess I'm just a believer in the free market to the point that if something is being consumed, it's probably something that someone wants to consume, and I'm fine with that as long as everyone is playing on a level field. So why so much stone-cold hate for Activision and Big Gaming? Can't we just choose what we want to play and be happy with others' choices?

tl:dr, gamers feel incredibly possessive over the choices of certain companies. if you don't want to pay, don't pay, problem?

And, I'm probably done with Zelda games for good now. 

First of all, the motion controls. They are good for motion control standards, yes. It doesn't change the fact that motion controls are NOT GOOD for this kind of game. They work for Wii Sports, they don't work for Zelda. The main reason in my opinion is that it doesn't work well for long playing sessions (like laying down while playing), the controls aren't reliable for fast action (like trying to shoot the octopus in the eye and your cursor goes ape shit, or trying to charge your sword and you're pointing it up but Link is pointing to the side), and the game generally becomes more about performing the controls than solving a puzzle, exploring etc.

While brings me to my second point, this game is barely about exploring and puzzle solving anymore. It is very linear, Fi is constantly telling you what to do, dowsing more or less eliminates the need to explore, side quests are all very straight forward fetch quests that Fi tells you exactly how to solve or you dowse for what you're looking for. Zelda 1-3 for me had a very strong sense of isolation and exploration and that feeling is almost completely gone now. You are never alone with Fi or just game messages navigating and narrating almost everything you do.

Finally, the story, characters, etc., are not good. In my opinion, with video games, if the story isn't GOOD, it's bad. If it's not specifically awesome, it just detracts from the game and SS is full of totally mediocre characters. ""well asshole how do you suggest they make it better then huh?"" Answer - don't have them. There's no need. Instead of having some Goron explain to you what the Bird Statues are, how about you just find out on your own? Why does everything have to be so spelled out? It adds to the mystery of a game and actually makes those little moments when you figure it out cool. Another example: there is not a god damn thing about the time shifting stones that needs to be explained. How about they just leave it to you and 30 seconds of experimenting to figure out what happens when you hit those crystal switches? It would be way cooler, more mysterious, way more fun. For reference, my favorite type of story telling happens with a game like Super Metroid or more recently Portal, Ico. 

Sorry that turned into a bit of a rant and I wanted to keep this civil for truegaming but I feel so frustrated with what Zelda is becoming compared to what it could be. I read some article today about how the Zelda producers are sticking with motion controls and couldn't go back to button controls, and I see the dialogue/exposition-heavy style has only increased with time so I don't see that going away. So I think that's it for me and the Zelda series. I'll be crying alone with the lights off playing LTTP on my phone if anyone has a comment...

EDIT: A lot of people have said something like ""When has Zelda ever had a good story line? Why complain about that?""

What got me thinking about it was some levels in Super Mario 3D Land, where I have to go through the whole level without dying or I get sent back to the start. By about the fifteenth time I was pretty much doing it by muscle memory, and it felt laborious to do so. I encounter similar feelings with Super Meat Boy, which I have 100% Completed (Except for Cotton Alley), I spent 3 hours on a particular level and just *grinded* on and on through it.

I've always wished that games played out more like that. I think it would add a lot of weight and immersion to the world the game is presenting.

I just wonder why there aren't more games that strive to be believable. Like an FPS game where you generally avoid confrontation unless necessary, where you sling your gun or lower it when it's not in use, where overwhelming enemies can make them surrender or drop their weapons and flee (where the enemy behave more like actual humans than AI-controlled turrets).

""I am going to just play through the game and not worry about looking in every corner as I go.""

That lasted about -12 seconds. I'm now about 25 hours into the game and I have checked every corner of every building of every city I've come across. And I don't know why. I have plenty of money, I generally remember where the 'good' equipment can be found, but for some reason I need to take 5 minute detours to pick up a couple of 'hidden' stimpaks.

I've played games before and cheated to get myself infinite money and the best gear, but I still go searching every corner. It's like I can't turn it off.

I think it all stems from FF IX. That game had more hidden crap than any other game I ever played, and it was one of the first RPGs I ever played. Hell, I remember one room early in the game was perfectly circular with a ladder in the middle and nothing else. I think the room had 3 items hidden in it with no indicators.

So I guess I have a few questions/points:

1. Why do people scrounge? Does it come from an earlier experience(like I theorize what happened to me)? Is it something to do with basic psychology?

2. Why do games hide random worthless crap down side paths? Or along perfectly smooth walls with no indicators that they exist? Is it just to extend gameplay a small amount? Is it to reward the people that search? I'm not talking about a 'hidden' item that are awesome, I'm talking about wasting time going after 34 credits and a stimpak.

3. If you don't scrounge what goes through your head when you see an obvious 'side' path that you choose to ignore? I've watched my wife walk past optionals when playing video games and every time I feel like I'm going to explode.

We've seen a lot of open world games in the last generation and we're constantly hearing about how players are given more choices and more freedoms - and with the advent of ""player driven"" gameplay we're seeing video games take on a much more unique style of story telling. Where one player may stick to the beaten path other players can go down a unique route and open up the game in a way that even the developers possibly didn't account for; but no matter how open a game is and no matter how many choices the player is given these games still end up being fairly restrictive in terms of what actually happens. 

Since they are almost the epitome of open world games I'll have to mention Skyrim and Fallout. While open world, and providing players with a tonne of options, the way the world operates and presents itself is pretty much the same player to player. Some choices throughout the game may see different out comes between players, but ultimately the game world doesn't react to player actions, much less react to its own events. One of the themes in Skyrim, the civil war, barely even begins to scratch at the inner workings of Skyrim as a story. In a world were towns should be fought over (and indeed are) very little actually changes the mechanics or experiences of the games. Regardless of who wins the war the world of Skyrim takes no notice. Playing through a number of times may net the player with different experiences, but ultimately the in-game universe remains as stale and static for the next player. Certain characters, quests, relationships etc remain exactly the same regardless of what the player does. Much of this can also be applied to Fallout where you meet the same characters in the same place who give you the same quests.

I don't want to imply that such games should be ever changing and procedurally generated, so I'm only using them as a basis, but instead I'll refer to some other games that world perfectically fit the dynamics I would like to see. Freelancer (a space sim from 2003) and the STALKER series are two such games that are really good experiences, limited by static mechanics, but would also greatly improve from dynamic actions.

Freelancer is a prime example of a game which was static and could have been greatly improved by being more dynamic. Freelancer is a space sim, which features planets, space stations, and small bases in the form of asteroids. Each and every one of these ""bases"" is owned be a faction, of which there are about 50. Each faction has set enemies and allies, belongs to a ""House"" (political sectors within the game world) and can be classified as either a government authority (i.e. police, military), corporation, or criminal organisation. What made this particularly interesting was that the player, as a ""freelancer"" has an allegience rating to *every single faction* and any actions for or against one faction would impact the players standing with the allies and enemies of that faction. Help out the police in one House and the criminals of that house will likely turn against you. Befriend the criminals and the police will treat you as one. Or, you could find nuetrality, and make your trade runs that much easier. As mentioned, the Houses also played a role - befriending the police in one House doesn't mean you befriend the police in other Houses, but may affect your standing with some criminal or coporate factions who operate between Houses. As one example, the ""Rheinland Military"" are enemies of a corporation called the Gas Mining Guild - trade with the GMG too much and they may begin to favour you, which in turn means the military takes a dislike to you, which also means the Rheinland Police may take a disliking to you, which also means some corporations in that house may also dislike you. The NPC ships of these factions would fly along designated routes, and from time to time you'd come across skirmishes that you could take part in if you felt obliged. What didn't exist is the influence of power of these factons. Freelancer had quite a bit of in-game lore about these 50 factions, and as mentioned earlier every single base the player landed on was owned by a faction... but only ever that faction. You never saw factions compete for control over these bases, nor did the economy change or react in any way to any events.

STALKER on the other hand is a series where NPC's fight each other and can sometimes take over the little spots littered around maps. This wasn't so much a faction war, but it was a step in bringing the game world to life. STALKER is a world where the AI/NPCs do their own thing. They don't proactively take over ""bases"" (such things don't *really* exist in this game), but what you see is a world that sort of exists with or without player interaction. If you come across the Duty faction in a skirmish with Bandits you can just sit back and watch them duke it out. Mutants can fight each other. Mutants can fight NPC's and all of them will roam around maps doing their own thing. STALKER is a limited game though, and it certainly has its dynamic moments, but it really doesn't have the infrastructure in place to change the game drastically from player to player. Much like in Skyrim with its static NPC's, experiences in STALKER and Freelancer end up being just as static because the game world never changes.

What I want to see in the future is a game world that is ever changing, with or without player interaction (especially without player interaction, but certainly because of player interaction). In the case of Freelancer I want to see militaries go to war, corporations try and out do each other, economies crash, burn and strengthen. I want to enter a system one day and happily trade there, only to return the next day and see that it's under new management and yesterdays good are now worth putty. In STALKER I want to see a world where the NPC's own ""areas"" and can lose them - possibly even to the point that a whole map comes under the control of a new faction. I really want to see this happen without the player doing anything. Even players tend to make games just as ""static"" when they seek to find the ""best"" (most powerful, easiest, etc) way to do things. In games like TF2 you can server hop and find sentry guns in the exact same positions, players taking the same routes, or making the same tactical decisions despite the fact that there are 20 different players (or if you server hop enough potentially hundreds of players making the *exact* same decisions). I don't need to have 10 different coversation choices, I don't need a story to be ever evolving, I need the game world to be alive. Games such as EVE may be player driven and dynamic, but they also come with a steep (i.e. suicidal) learning curve where it pretty much takes a real life understanding of economics to understand what is happening.

My dream for the future of open world gaming is that I can enter a world that exists with or without me, that changes over time whether I want it to or not; but I also want to enter that world knowing that my actions can be as big or loud as I make them.

Why or why not?",BacteriaEP,366,103,629,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/ztq6x/with_the_wiiu_date_pricing_and_more_games/,"Nintendo pretty much revealed everything noteworthy about the console.

* To be released in the USA on November 18th, Europe on November 30th, and Japan December 12th
* Will cost $299 for the 8gb white version, $349 for the 32gb black version. I don't know if the colors are interchangeable. 
* Bayonetta 2 announced as exclusive. CoD Block Ops 2, Monster Hunter and more announced.

So with that said... what do you guys think?

Personally, I'm intrigued still though a bit disappointed at the price point. I was really hoping for it to come in at $250, but I don't know the exact economics of the situation. That touch screen controller is probably pretty pricey.

My biggest worry is that the system will still be dependent on the WiiMotes and not the WiiPad. I have a Wii and yeah it was fun for a time, but I'm pretty much over motion controls at this point (be it Move, Kinect or Wii). I really want Nintendo to focus everything on the WiiPad and give us a more traditional, yet enhanced gaming experience with the addition of that 5 inch display.

Additionally, I fear another shovelware fest as what happened with the Wii. There were plenty of good games out for the system, but in order to find them you had to go through mounds of crapware. It really bogged down the system and gave it a serious image problem.

That said, I'm really looking forward to seeing just what we're going to be able to do with that controller. So much so that it's almost enough to get me to buy the system outright without the worry because I think I'll at least enjoy the concept that much.

Oh and ZombieU, despite the name, still looks like it's going to be a solid game from Ubisoft. Let's just hope it doesn't go all Red Steel on us and pull a 180 from previews to release.

I started looking for a decent gaming rig a year and a half ago, and was perplexed by the recommendations many PC gamers made on what to buy. It seems to be a sort of elitism in PC gaming to have a 'perfect' rig with 8 or more gigs of RAM and video cards/ CPUs at top of the line performance. I finally gave up on gaming forums and started looking at the bare minimums for games like Fallout New Vegas and Crysis; what I found confused me.

With a second to bottom level graphics card I had console level graphics with 40-60 FPS on current generation games. I spent $70 instead of $120 and was completely satisfied with my GPU, yet every place I looked told me to shell out almost 100 extra dollars. Now I've gotten to the point where I'm ready to upgrade my PC, but I don't have to. Had I only asked the PC gaming community I wouldn't have ever gotten my PC set up for gaming, and I think that overselling what is bare minimum pushes gamers away from the computer.

Often when hearing of a new RPG (mostly MMORPG), I rush with haste to the website to learn of the skill options. Most of the time, I am deeply disappointed by the lack of variety.

I'm certain that there is a large enough player-base that enjoys skills like smithing, cooking, farming, etc. (cartography?). TES explores these options fairly nicely but certainly not as robustly as one would hope. Some shining examples that I believe aptly illustrate my point (that I've had experience with) include SWG, Runescape, and Ultima Online. *I also note the progress Minecraft is making here.

So my question to you all fine people is why don't more games explore non-combat skills. Can robust, deep gameplay systems in menial traits thrive alongside combat-based ones? Thanks.

The formula was very well made and actually spawned some spin offs like BMX, Snowboard and even Surfing games. Most of these games had very high review scores and were best sellers everywhere.

Suddenly, I stopped hearing anything about this genre. The last time I searched for a game like this I found a rerelease of the first Tony Hawk in HD which was destroyed by the critics due to the lacking of some of the original content.

There were other developers that tried to release similar games but failed. Skate 3 comes to mind and there was also a version of Tony Hawk that gave you the ability of controlling the game by standing on a fake Skateboard that had motion control.

So, my question is: what exactly happened? Why did such a popular genre failed to bring anything good in the past couple of years? Will we ever see something as good as the first games again?

1350643514.0,259,self.truegaming,11qpgw,"Final Fantasy X is a fantastically well-developed game. For anyone who played it through as a kid, I urge you to play it again - the subtleties you can pick up on as an adult are excellent. ",,477,218,401,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/11qpgw/final_fantasy_x_is_a_fantastically_welldeveloped/,"I'm not sure how often this has been written on - probably a little - but I feel like with the current stagnation of JRPGs it's interesting to go back and probe what made the hallmark games of the genre so tremendously popular. Also to appraise what, consequently, has led to the deterioration of the genre. 

I feel like the artistic repetition and somewhat ill-advised experimentation of later Final Fantasies (particularly a certain most recent one that I'm sure I don't have to name) can lead one to look back on the whole franchise as typifying decadent JRPG absurdity: incomprehensible battle systems and terminology, rigidity, melodrama and really poor story contextualisation. Children with no prior training attempting to save the world through a highly counter-intuitive magic system? Yeah, I can see where the critics come in.

But Final Fantasy X was perhaps so popular because it contextualised all the usual JRPG guff so well. Instead of the usual big bad - hopelessly evil villain who one can't relate to as a character (although I know the Final Fantasies have been good with characterisation, the good v. evil dichotomy is laughable) - we have a metaphysical entity representing ego and human torment. It is less about facing abject evil than facing human vice and defeating it within oneself. As a reflexive tool, this works really well, particularly in grounding the struggles of the protagonists in the villain itself. 

The battles do not feel as grindy. As a JRPG, grinding is involved, but the battles are well contextualised. Constant fights with the spawn of Sin mean that the enemies usually have a bearing on the relationship with the overall antagonist (Sin) and aren't the usual randomised JRPG boss fodder, except where other antagonist characters are involved. The battles are also, at least in the start, with considerably good use of pacing, not immediately overwhelming. They are introduced methodically, and many of the creatures have to do with the narrative.  

The party swap-out system likewise has the effect of increasing the strategic usefulness of all the characters, as well as creating a bond between them and the player, and also creating a sense of their unity as a team. This is particularly important to the overall theme of pilgrimage in the game. And while arguably all Final Fantasies do well at creating a group dynamic, this game does it the most thoroughly through the use of swap-out device. All party members are relying on each other at all times. 

Summoning is also contextualised through the religious setting, and new aeons (summoned creatures) are gained throughout the journey following prayer. This makes sense to the narrative. 

Aside from the narrative itself being very strong, the internal logic of the game (in the ways I've stated before) only compounds the sense of progression and story the player feels. It is, for a JRPG, very internally consistent. And perhaps this is why today it holds up better than ever. Upon replaying it, despite the patchy English translation, I was impressed by the depth of its themes. 

I had originally defended FFXIII, but upon playing FFX, I was struck by how arbitrary FFXIII felt. Sure, you're saving the world, but so little of your actions feel as though they're aiding this process. You feel more as though you're being compelled towards the end, rather than enforcing a set of consistent skills. 

Of course, I might be cherry-picking. I am pretty taken by the overall style and feel of the game, but I just thought I'd weigh in, and give some deserved attention to what I believe is a near-perfect game.

Now all these and more are pretty much guaranteed otherwise the A.I will look dumb.

---

When you ascend in Dark Souls, the environments become more fantastic and bright. The game still gets tougher, but the aesthetics become more warm and almost divine. Just the opposite is also true of descending, the world becomes more harsh and the environments more dark and desolate. Just compare New Londo Ruins to Anor Londo for the most direct indication of a really cool visual motif present throughout the entire game.

The first area after the tutorial (Firelink Shrine) is a microcosm of the visual motif of ascending/descending. The 3 possible routes (Undead Burg, New Londo Ruins, and The Catacombs) all inform the player on which route they actually need to take both from the beginning and for most of the game. The game accomplishes this in 2 ways: through its visuals and difficulty.

As I mentioned originally, the easier and more comforting (well comforting in Dark Souls terms) routes start upward.

Undead Burg is both the easiest route and the path to the first bell (which, by the way, is at the highest point you can reach in Undead Burg/Parish) and is visually brighter than the other two paths.

The Catacombs is the middling difficult path, it's gloomier and the skeletons along its path are tough as nails so it discourages you from taking that way, while still maintaining just the right level of manageable challenge that you know you can come back and kick ass once you've leveled up more.

New Londo Ruins is pitch black and damn near incomprehensible, an obtuse and punishing region at the bottom of a long ass elevator. Those ghosts will fuck you when you're just starting out and it'll be a long time before you can even figure out how to hurt them.

So after you realize that going up is the only way that doesn't cream you its just a matter of climbing through Undead Burg and Undead Parish to the first bell. While the second bell does take you downwards to Blightown before you go upwards through Sen's Fortress, it reinforces the idea that going down is where all the miserable shit lays in wait. Curse Lizards, poison swamps and long falls are all that await before you beat Quelaag and ring that bell (A kind of foreshadowing for Dark Souls third act).

Then you go up through Sen's Fortress, and up through Anor Londo until you reach the highest point to ogle Gwyndolyn. The game has grabbed the player through its mechanics, visuals and level design to say ""look dude if you want to progress go up"".

After Anor Londo, Dark Souls intentionally subverts this structure as a means of raising the narrative and gameplay stakes.

Immediately after you speak with ~~Gwyndolyn~~ Gwynevere (happy now?) you are directed to Frampt, the only npc to provide solid and consistent exposition to that point. Frampt will ask you to set the Lord Vessel and deem you the chosen Undead. What's important here is that Frampt takes you BELOW the world, BELOW everything else you'd traversed at that point, to show you where the Lord Vessel must be placed and that the Kiln of the First Flame is the narrative's new focal point.

A new conceit is established here, narrative progression becomes a downward journey.

Every new area reinforces this new conceit. The Abyss is a plunge below New Londo Ruins, the Valley of the Giants is is a continuous and corrupting spiral downward, Lost Izalith is distinctly below Blighttown, resembling Hell, a metaphor for how far down into Lordan you've traveled (and how grotesque it continues to get as you go lower).

While the Duke's Archives appears to be an exception to this rule it's actually the most clever example of this new progression. The Duke's Archives is the most obvious first choice of the four new routes you can take. Like the Undead Burg, it's brightly lit, easiest, and goes upward. So you start in the Archives whooping everybody on your way up the stairs to fight Seath. As anyone whose played knows, you can't win that fight, it's scripted to make you lose (the one exception in a game where every fight is beatable). Seath is teaching the player, he's saying ""You're not supposed to go up anymore stupid."" You respawn at the top at the Archives and must work your way back down through the Crystal Cave to actually beat Seath. Like Frampt, moving downward as a means of progression is reinforced through the gameplay, level design and aesthetics.

After you defeat those four final bosses, you go back to the Kiln at the very bottom of Lordan to fight Gwyn and beat the game.

And so, with that, I want to share with my experience last Friday night which managed to both top any video game experience I've ever had, while also opening my mind to new ways that games could draw players into a story. That experience was a show in New York City called ""Sleep No More"".

So what is ""Sleep No More?"" In short, it's a retelling of MacBeth mixed with Hitchcock and film noir, told mostly without words in a six story 1940s era hotel with more than 100 rooms. Guests are dropped off, sometimes in small groups, sometimes alone, by an elevator operator on various floors. They are given white masks that cover the entire face and instructed not to talk. In the words of the elevator operator as he pushed me out of the door, ""This is an experience to be had alone. Things are not always what they seem, and fortune favors the bold.""


Wandering off of the elevator, I found myself in a dark hallway, with little understanding of where I am or where to go. But then, I heard soft music. Following it, the hallway opened into a huge hotel ballroom where 20 or so people were dancing an intricately choreographed waltz. A young waitress walked around passing out drinks and a pair of dancers began flirting with each other. But then, the lights cut out and the music turned dark. Suddenly the young waitress was in the center of the room, illuminated by a spot light. She begins an intense, writhing dance and before our eyes, rips out her hair to reveal that she is bald and transforms from an innocent servant girl into some sort of snake like monster. This is one of MacBeth's three witches.

This was one of the less strange things I saw last night. Other highlights include

* A woman eating raw human hearts only to then spit out a silver ring and give it to an audience member. She then began singing an old jazz song in a man's voice.
* Stumbling into a bedroom to find Lady MacBeth greeting MacBeth as he returns from battle and both of them naked, making love before she tries to convince him to kill the king.
* Spending time in a detective's office, reading the case files that were inside his desk when the detective comes in, motions for me to come with him. I follow him into a back room covered in black and white photos, with a work bench in the back. He opens a drawer and inside is a dead bird which he begins dissecting with tweezers.
* Finding a graveyard and the ruins of a bombed out church with a man beating his head against a statue.
* Discovering the witch's hut, which in this version is a ruined nightclub. This turned into a crazy techno music orgy with strobe lights and lasers where a naked man put on a bulls's head, two naked witches made out with each other, and then a bloody, dead baby was paraded around the room.

So, what does this have to do with games? Well, for one, the total freedom to see things, while still giving enough subtle clues to get you to where the action is. And then, being able to see all of these non-linear pieces and letting them form the narrative for me. I'm still sure that I only got maybe 70% of the story, but it just makes me want to go again. The thing was like being in Bioshock's Rapture for the first time, but without the combat but the same amount of fear. I would love to see this experience replicated in a game - a fully detailed, open environment with a non-combat focused story and enough clues to let the player figure out what's going on without making it feel like they were led by the hand.

Also, its just an amazing experience, if you can get down with weird and artsy. It's maybe the most unique thing I've ever been a part of.

TL;DR Very good read, if you're into game design (or story telling for that matter). It constructs a better understanding of what makes a game immersive.

The article refers to the Theory of Spatial Presence (aka, Immersion), where Players form a representation in their minds of the space or world with which the game is presenting them and begin to favour the media-based space (I.e., the game world) as their point of reference for where they “are” (or to put it in psychological terms, their “primary ego reference frame”)

Then, continues with defining Game Characteristics Leading to Spatial Presence, grouping them into two general categories: those that create a rich mental model of the game environment and those that create consistency between the things in that environment. And afterwards, refers to each player's ability to immerse themselves in the game's world.

Finally concludes by stating that completeness of sensory information (how good of a job the game does at providing you with information about the its world through more than just text, like sound) means that the fewer blanks about the mental model of the game world that the player has to fill in, the better. Additionally states that, cognitively demanding environments, where players have to focus on what’s going on, can also be good for immersion. Then highlights the importance of a gripping story and plot, and the technical aspects of the game.

So, lets talk immersion... Can you think of any good examples? What do you think factored in making the game immersive for you? ",,False,,t5_2sgq6,1373496321.0,,,True,t3_1hyo3j,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1hyo3j/the_psychology_of_immersion_in_video_games/,

When I heard US ~~civil war~~ war of independence I was really afraid it will suck but I'm really enjoying it (even though there are some minor glitches that break immersion and I liked the combat system in previous AC games more). The thing that I'm enjoying probably the most are the naval battles. Too bad they are available only during the naval missions and you don't have the option to board the ship. I'd really love to have an option to just go on the seas and do some pirating. I know it would be an overkill for an AC game but as a standalone game I would buy it and play it. Really, all I want is an open-world (well, open-sea) 17-19th century naval game.

so after this long intro - why hasn't anyone developed such a game? I think people would go for it. I remember ""Age of Pirates"" as a pretty good game... throw in some ""ship vs ship"" or ""fleet vs fleet"" multiplayer option and I think you would have a really good game... Any thoughts truegaming?

Yet, sometimes its the small things that matter. What small features add to gameplay and story while going unoticed?

Example 1: In GTA IV, some mission introductions have dialouge that changes each time you restart the mission, making the drive across the city less annoying and more interesting. If you fail many times, the person you are transporting may say something like ""You know, I feel like you know what's going on, so I'm just going to listen to the radio now"".

Example 2: Spec Ops: The Line (Possible Spoiler) [As you progress through the game, melee kills become more brutal, and the weapons available to you do more damage and are more dangerous.

Now this is a game that consoles skip pretty much entirely, And that is undeniably a good thing, however I personally really like this game. 

I like it because as frustrating as it is to have a game that won't work properly, the satisfaction you get after you figure out why it not working and fix it is remarkable. Hell it is akin to defeating a boss in Dark Souls. Sometimes the solution is easy, my wife had to reinstall Borderlands 2 to get it to stop crashing. Or hard, I spent days tweaking Sleeping Dogs to stop it stuttering out frames. Or at the moment impossible (I have yet to figure out why Max Payne 1 or 2 refuse to load).



But when the solution finally presents itself, wow what great feeling that is. And I am sure many of you would think ""why go through all that trouble?"".

* (1993-1998) The idSoft era: Beginning with Doom as the first mainstream appealing shooter, ending with Q3A as the peak of idSoft's complete works.

* (1998 - 2004) SciFi Shooters: Rise of ""game changers"" like Unreal, UT, Tribes, Half-Life. Fast and wide movement, Extraterrestrial / Space Opera themes. I think that the last relevant game of this era was UT 2004.

* (2002 - 2008) WW2  / Historic war-themed Games: Starting with Medal of Honor: Allied Assault in 2002 (ignoring it's predecessors on the PSX), Battlefield 1942 and the first Call of Duty in 2003. There was also a ""branch"" of  Vietnam-themed games like Men of Valor, BF: Vietnam. It ended with World at War and the several Brothers in Arms games.

* (2007 - 201?) Modern military shooters: Beginning with Modern Warfare 1. I know that Battlefield 2 was the first mainstream fps to use this theme, but I think that MW1 had far more impact than BF2. It changed the FPS mainstream as none of the former ""eras"" or ""paradigms"" did it before. It deadlocked the genre to this point.

Don't take this categories to strict, it's just meant as a rough division. These categories don't exclude other very succesful franchises and I know that there were several classics in scifi-fps (System Shock) or modern military fps (Counterstrike) long before my categorizations. My categorization does also not mean that I'm ignoring very successful franchises like Halo for instance.

**My questions to you guys:**

* What do you think will be the next mainstream theme in shooters? Will we be stuck to the Modern Warfare theme for the next time?

* Do you think that Black Ops 2 could be a game or theme changer? It shifts the theme from Modern Military to a mix of Modern Warfare and ScFi / Cyberpunk / Future Warfare elements. I'm not mentioning the quality of innovation, but the impact on the large amount of blindly following fans and the competitors, from EA to Capcom (RE Multiplayer), trying to be the 'next Call of Duty'.

* I remember the times when people were fed up with WW2 games and that the timing of MW1 filled that need for change. Do you think that there might be a fresh demand for modern mainstream WW2 games?

**[GTA IV STORY SPOILERS!!]** 


[and by the end of the game I had all of this money without much to do with it. I mean, you'll have all you'll ever need for guns and health but there's nothing fun to spend it on. There's only so many clothes and there's only so many people you can hang out with. Eventually it got to the point where I thought ""fuck, I have all this money and it serves no purpose."" 


In the first half of the game you can't just buy whatever you want because you'll go broke. But in the end it's just points. They serve no purpose and are there to look at. It gave me sort of an empty feeling. And then I remembered when i chose to kill the guy Niko was searching for the entire game. I mean, I've just been doing favors the whole game. Why not do this guy a favor and end his awful life and give Niko what he's been after the whole time. Niko deserves the mental and physical repercussions for going this far with it. But anyways, as I was driving Roman home, Niko kept saying how empty and unfulfilling the whole thing was. Like he felt the same - maybe worse after he finished the mission he ultimately came to the Liberty City for. But the journey of getting there he seemed to determined the whole time to find it. After all, he murdered countless people to get where he was; and I believe Niko is good at heart (oh man, that sounds ridiculous.)


I couldn't help but feel the same way about all the money I made and what I imagine a lot of ridiculously rich people feel too. It just comes down to points and it is ultimately empty. It's just a lack of content to buy and it will, of course, eventually happen. But the whole idea of The American Dream and it's possibilities supposedly bring you happiness is a huge part of this game. And I feel like Niko is one of the few people that sees that it's all a big money sham that won't, in finally having it, give you true happiness.


The lack of in-game content to buy just stood out to me a lot. I mean, it's not like the content could have been infinite; but I felt like it was strengthening some of the game's themes. I fucking love Rockstar. Their characters are amazing.](/spoiler)

There are only two things that are holding it back for me. First, the idea that a single guy and his crew roam around the galaxy fixing everyone's little problems sometimes gets a little hard to believe. There's literally a side mission where you go to a remote system to vent some gas from a room and turn on a control panel. Then you leave. Seems like a waste of valuable military resources. The other is Cerberus. While they serve an important purpose, it comes to a point where it seems they mostly play the role of the mischievous villain who's up to no good again, and you have to foil their little plans. Again, this is mostly limited to the side missions, as their involvement in the main story arc is indispensable.

I'm curious because having lived in Japan and Korea, I am continually disappointed by the depiction of Asian locales in games as they usually fall prey to blatant 'Orientalism' without truly capturing the 'feel' of a particular location. Usually this comes from copious use of pagodas and other typically Chinese architecture where it doesn't belong, and making any urban center feel exactly like the American idea of a 'big metropolis' without any consideration of local details, and finally filling it with cringe-inducing Asian caricatures (which could be a whole discussion in itself).

What I consider to be good depictions:

**Secret World's Seoul**: while perhaps not the most accurate example, it does a decent enough job to stand out in my mind. Its starting location with its mix of modern architecture and traditional housing is recognizable as drawing inspiration from areas like [Bukchon](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/14/world/asia/14iht-houses.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0). While some of the details seem off (brightly colored cars that aren't sedans, what's this?!), overall it at least feels like the developers tried to make it feel authentic. Now if only the character creator could making something vaguely representing an Asian character...

**Kane &amp; Lynch's Tokyo**: The game has its share of flaws, but this level sticks out as the shining example of how to do Japan in a video game. Granted, I haven't spent much time in Tokyo, especially whatever upscale financial district the level is imitating, but the details sold it to me. As soon as the elevators opened and the police officer addressed you in real Japanese (and not some terrible butchered phonetic reading) I was grinning like an idiot. The little things really grabbed my attention and made it feel like Japan: the accurate police uniforms and cars, the businessmen in suits, the pedestrian overpass with the bike racks underneath, the vending machines, the convenience store storefronts, the buses and their singsong voices. I could tell that someone had made an effort to really capture the essence of Japan in that level.

And some particularly egregious examples that come to mind:

**Dreamfall's Japan**: Sure it's the future, but it felt all wrong. The Weird mashmash of cartoony Japanese architecture made the area feel like a Japan-themed theme park, all the details felt forced (token vending machine, but it doesn't resemble a Japanese one at all), everyone spoke in British and American accents with random cringe-worthy butchered Japanese inserted (-san, gomen nasai).

**Chaos Theory's Seoul**: It just felt like a random NYC-style urban area with Korean-language signs everywhere. It's hard to pinpoint but the architecture felt very 'western' and didn't remind me of any area of Seoul that I've been to. And I've never seen random Chinese lanterns just strung up around the city in real life either (more Orientalism perhaps). I felt that the mappers were just making it up as they went along without any significant reference materials. The outrageous 'Asian' accents of the soldiers only made my frown deeper.

...so what games do their real-life settings justice? What details make the setting for you? It doesn't have to be an Asian example, I'm eager to hear about any good video game depictions.

Of course, everything in moderation, right?  So assuming that you wanted to control your child's habits (which I hope most would, to some extent), how do you go about this?

For instance, my son is 3 years old (4 soon).  Yesterday him and I sat on the couch and I watched him play Journey for about 30 minutes.  The progress he made astounded me.  He didn't run in circles and get lost.  He actually did many of the same things I'd find myself doing.  Progressing through the game, checking cool things out, and asking questions like, ""What does this do?""  I thought it was awesome.  And we got to do it together.  He'd get lifted up into the air and land on a platform and I'd exclaim, ""Holy cow!  Look at that!  Did you really just fly up there??""  I could see his little face grin as I assume he thought, ""Yeah, I just did that.""

A lot of the times he only plays games every other day.  Sometimes more.  He's gone through things like PBS Kids flash games, Noby Noby Boy, Flower (Ok, I'll just get out of the way the fact that he loves cheap PSN games, don't ask me why.), iPad games, Wii games (like Mario and Kirby).  It amazes me how good he's getting at some of these games already, though.

Anyway, as I said, moderation.  He loves going outside, I take him out as much as time allows and I get him to be as social as I possibly know how.  In fact, I don't really have friends with kids, so I pay (what feels like) a lot of money to get him around other kids as much as possible at the Universities pre-school.  But I really think there's something there in video games that's also good for a child's development so long as it's constantly maintained and observed.

So parents of Reddit, as you can see this is a pretty general topic.  But I just wanted a place where I can read other parents thoughts on things like how old their child was when they started.  What they do to maintain this hobby and make sure it doesn't get out of hand.  Or what it even means to get out of hand.

I'm looking for stories from people in my situation now or parents that take the opposite path (perhaps no games, period, until they are older?).  Or parents that have ""been there, done that"" and care to share their sentiments.  Also, are there studies being done about this?  I'd love to hear about those, too.

Maybe that's a bit incorrect. Maybe a bit of levity is more accurate. Or maybe variety. But whatever the case, it need some non-doom and gloom moments in it.

I think one of the mistakes people make with horror games is the idea that it should be unrelenting. That it should keep the tension the whole way through.

Fact of the matter is, this is probably the best way to quickly bore out your audience.

Think about it. Think about Disney and Pixar films. They're not all happy all the time. In fact, most of them have very dark moments in them. But that variety is what makes those good moments feel even better and what gives all those dark moments all that weight.

The same applies to horror.

Keeping the atmosphere horrible and oppressive just desensitizes us from that atmosphere. We get used to it and it stops being scary after a while.
 
----

**What horror needs is uncertainty**.

The second error I think that happens in horror is the idea that inevitability is scary. NO.

Fear isn't the knowing that something is out to get you. No. Fear is the uncertainty of it all. It's the knowledge that you're *probably* safe but with that nagging, incy wincy voice asking what if you aren't.

Let's take Amnesia. What many consider as the best survival horror of this generation. I will agree. It's great. It's scary. For a while.

Once you figure out that after every puzzle, a monster spawns, once you **know** that you *have* to get pass a monster, it's not quite fear that drives you. Maybe you still experience a fight of flight mode boosted by adrenaline, but it's not quite *fear*. At worst, it's an irritates sigh that says, ""Let's just get this over with"".

Connected with that is the last one.

----

**Fear isn't rational**.

When I was a kid. I was afraid of the dark. But I wasn't stupid. I knew that monsters didn't exist. But I was afraid of them nonetheless.

People are afraid of spiders, even the little ones that can't hurt them, even when they **know** that that spider can't hurt them. People fear the heights even in a place they *know* should be safe. etc.

Let's face it. We're afraid of stupid things for stupid reasons. But that's fear.

And yet, games present fear in a very rational manner. Everything to be feared in a game, the game itself gives you a very rational reason to fear.

I'm not gonna say that a monster that you're afraid of because you know it can hurt you(or your character) doesn't invoke fear. It does. But it just doesn't evoke the same kind of fear IMO.

I'll admit, that last one is pretty hard to make a game of. But one can dream. Who knows.

Why would I ever? It is always the most boring choice, it will not resolve any conflicts - neither peacefully (that's what good does) nor violently (that's what evil does).

Gaming slowly yet steadily works toward making good and evil equivalent choices. Situations where good vs evil is ""helping grannies vs eating babies"" are more rare. Also, the tendency to make good vs evil a matter of ""I don't want a reward vs I want a reward"" diminishes as well. Sometimes they go with it but it results in a larger reward for your good choices later, while evil is more rewarding immediately.

But what about neutrality? Neutrality gets the ream. 

Alice wants to save the kittens, Bob wants to kill 'em. Side with Alice and get a shield of kitten-saving +2, side with Bob and get a kitten fur-decorated lance +2. Side with neither (the neutral choice) and get neither nor.

Or assume the game has some sort of a karma scale. Be evil, get evil ending, get cool evil perks. Be good, get good ending, get cool good perks. Be neutral, get nothing and lukewarm ending. Even if there are two ""separate scales"" for goodness and evilness, the proper choice isn't to be neutral, it's to be alternating between good and evil. That doesn't make you neutral, that makes you bipolar!

Now you can say rewards aren't important because I'm allowed to roleplay and should go with it, but look at it this way. If the game has character progression, the rewards you get make a character stronger. The baseline is usually doing all the sidequests or at least most of them. If you for example refuse to do an optional sidequest, technically your character is weaker than it is supposed to be.

Now if you've done the choice you're not rewarded for (neutrality) your character is weaker than it is supposed to be. You are punished for neutral choices.

Neutrality is always the wrong choice.



What do you think, truegaming? Is there a chance true impartiality is going to be properly represented and properly rewarded? Are there any videogames that already do it? 

**EDIT: The comment section currently points at the Alpha Protocol, Mass Effect 3, GalCiv 2, and the Witcher franchise. Shin Megami Tensei apparently makes the neutral path the hardest but gives you arguably the best ending if you follow through.**

Consider GNU/Linux. LT's team made the Linux kernel core, RMS's team made the GNU layer, various other people made various other software. They generally work well together.

1.  Post-apocalyptic civilization, with abandoned homes/businesses to explore, no working utilities (electricity, running water, etc).  Every time you meet someone would be a gamble.  Would they immediately try to kill you for your possessions, trade with you, join up with you, or maybe even trick you and turn on you after earning your trust.  Your biggest task would be finding food, water, and supplies.  A crafting system to build simple items out of other found items and materials would be important.  You could ""move in"" to any form of shelter you found, but the chances of being discovered by robbers/killers would increase every day you stay in the same spot.  This would encourage nomadic game play, and inventory management, as you couldn't necessarily carry everything you've found/made with you.  Perhaps you'd have a way of keeping more things with you, like a mule, shopping cart, or small wagon.  No monsters, no supernatural elements, just surviving in a mostly depopulated and semi-destroyed world.  My main inspiration for this idea is the book ""The Road"" by Cormack McCarthy.

2.  A completely uninhabited (by humans) wilderness.  No traces of humans exist at all.  Many of the same elements would work in this type of survival game, but without the possibility of meeting anyone, or finding anything useful.  You'd be 100% creating everything from first principles.  Your only enemies would be starvation, sickness, dangerous wild animals, and injury.  You'd go from ""waking up on a beach"" naked, to having a home, possessions, fields, gardens, simple machines, tools, tamed animals/pets/livestock, and hopefully your sanity.

If there's one thing most people seem to agree on, it's that the current MMORPG genre is in desperate need of deep, genuine change.  

Recently, we've seen games like DayZ, and Kickstarters like Star Citizen spark a lot of interest in the genre, and a lot of criticism for the theme park approach.  

Then there's EVE, the game everyone *loves to read about* but not that many folks play.  Regardless of whether you like it or hate it, it's hard to ignore the incredible, player driven conflict and drama that seems to be its core appeal.

Leaving aside the technical and pragmatic constraints, I'd like to hear your dreams for the sandbox MMO.  What's the sandbox MMO that you'd just love to play and what would you do in it?

My personal daydream is a medieval, zero magic fantasy sandbox with the combat of Chivalry.  Castles, law and order, crafting arms and armor, the economy and political relations would all be left up to the players to figure out on their own.  Be a bandit or a blacksmith, swear fealty to a powerful character or hire yourself out as a mercenary, buy a boat and trade rare spices or hunt down bounties posted for rebels and cutthroats, gamble, steal, burn and pillage, build, protect, develop roads and trade and fight to keep civilization and profit flowing against enemies foreign and domestic.  

How about you Truegaming?

I mean, I know why failure states exist. The player can die, or fail in such a way that theoretically they would not be able to continue.

Rather, why are games designed in such a way that they require failure states? Why are games becoming increasingly cinematic experiences, where there's one correct path, and all that deviating from it in any significant way gets you is put back where you started?

In Uncharted, for instance, if you fall somewhere that you would arguably survive (based on what you've already seen Drake survive), but that would make it impossible to continue on the clear path that the designers want you to be on, you've failed. Wouldn't it be interesting if that wasn't a failure state? If you were able to continue on from that fall? Or if Elena could die and this wouldn't just mean a restart of the gunfight?

I've thought for a while about how to do a Superman game the right way, and somewhere on the internet (I spent a few minutes searching for it, to no avail), I found basically the perfect fit, which I give to you now:

The next Superman game should have no failure states, no game over. Superman shouldn't be able to die. But this doesn't mean that Superman shouldn't be able to fail. These are two different concepts. 

Superman has limitations. Specifically, and usefully (from a game design standpoint), Superman can't be in two places at once. In this ideal Superman game, enemies won't be threats, they'll be obstacles, much like zombies are merely obstacles to be avoided in *Dead Rising*.

You're Superman. Your super hearing alerts you to a woman about to jump to her death (ala *All-Star Superman*). You can save her, but to do so will take some time, which you could be using to stop a man from being beaten to death in an alley or a car from crashing into a group of people at a bus-stop.

In this game, there would be no golden path. There's no way to save everybody. There's just the choices you make, and how you react to them. No do-overs, and no game-over.

In one mission, you're fighting to get to an intrepid reporter before they're killed, in some incredibly complicated facility. You have a time limit. When you fail to make it in time, you've failed, but the game continues. The failure means something, and the game plays out differently.

An example of where developers have made this work is the side mission with the Drell assassin Thane in *Mass Effect 2*. You're stalking a politician from the vents above, and there's a timer whenever the guy is out of sight. If the timer runs out, you've failed the mission. But is it a failure state? Nope. Thane doesn't trust you, because you fucked up, but life goes on. As linear as *Mass Effect* really is as a series when you look at the nuts and bolts of it, this is a really good example of why Bioware shine as a developer.

For a couple more recent (and therefore spoiler tagged) examples of how developers can work around requiring failure states, in *Spec Ops: The Line* when you come across the two men [you're asked to shoot by the voice-over, you can continue on without shooting either; though you do have to kill the snipers on the walls.](/spoiler) Additionally, in the ending [where you choose to live, you can choose to either hand your weapon over to the marine, or you can fight them. I actually think you shouldn't have been able to win that fight, but you can; Walker says ""Welcome to Dubai"" and walks back to the city over their corpses.](/spoiler)

EQ was one of my biggest MMO addictions - I was really into the game, was in beta, played retail - did the whole uber-guild raiding thing for years before burning out in University and sort of quitting MMO's altogether.

After reading a few of the first looks of EQNext - it seems pretty exciting: Skill-based gameplay, voxel based destructible world/environments,  players having a real impact on the world, dynamic/reactive AI - enemies with goals, motivations, fears, etc - not simply 'kill an orc, and it respawns in the same spot for ever, and ever, and ever'.

It all sounds rather pie in the sky and a molyneux-level of over promising, but do you think they can actually deliver?

At the time that EQ came out - they really did set the standard, and provided an innovative and captivating world and game. The team behind it have quite a few MMO's under their belts, so I think it is quite possible that EQNext could really be a big jump for MMO's instead of just yet another iteration of the current stale formula.

Even looking at the preview videos/etc, it doesn't have that 'MMO-look' that plagues almost every MMO currently out there - there is a certain sameness to them, from WoW to GW2, LOTR, and even Elder Scrolls online. Even if the art direction is different, there is just a certain 'something' that feels the same about them. When watching the videos for EQNext, they didn't immediately scream out 'This is an MMO' to me like many of the current games do.

Who knows, could be a big case of over-promise and under deliver, but in the few things I've read about it - sort of got that 'pit of my gut bubbly excitement' feeling for it.

What do you think - could EQ Next be the kick in the ass MMO's need? or is it just going to be a fresh coat of paint onto the same stale formula?

1319818381.0,238,self.truegaming,lsbbi,Has the financial success of WoW doomed Blizzard's ability to make quality games?,wilhelmsupreme,313,75,188,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/lsbbi/has_the_financial_success_of_wow_doomed_blizzards/,"I want to start this by stating that I'm a huge Blizzard fan. I own every game and expansion they've made since Warcrat 2. That said, I feel like WoW's financial success, coupled with the fact that they are (owned by) a publicly traded company, means that they will have to change how they make games forever.

Blizzard has always been a company that puts the quality of their games at the forefront. They are masters of making a fun experience and they have never released a game before it was ready in order to make a financial goal. It has always worked out for them because they were always able to grow, with each game being more successful than the last.

That trend stopped with WoW. WoW was an anomaly, and that's a big problem for a company like Blizzard and here's why: in the world of publicly traded companies, success is defined by GROWTH, and not in simply making a bunch of money. When a CEO consistently makes less money than the quarter before, that CEO is fired. It doesn't matter if they make 900 billion dollars one qarter and 899 billion the next. The total isn't the issue. The percentage growth is. Negative growth is negative share value, which in turn is unhappy share holders.

So Blizzard simply needs to make a spiritual successor to WoW.  What I mean by that is a subscription based game that has wide appeal. I think they can do it, but I don't think they can do it fast enough. WoW is bleeding subscribers (they lost 650,000 subscribers in the six months after Cataclysm). WoW players aren't impressed with what they've seen of the next expansion. They haven't announced their next-gen MMO, and when they do, it will likely be 3-4 years before it's released (based on their track record of releases). 

None of this would be any big deal if they were privately owned, but **if WoW subscribers continue to drop, Mike Morhaime is going to be pressured to get growth back on track. In order to do that, I believe Blizzard will have to change how they operate: putting more content out a hell of a lot faster, which is something that Blizzard has never done in order to preserve the quality of their games.**

In a recent conference call, it was revealed that even including StarCraft 2, WoW still managed to account for over 90% of Blizzard's revenue, and considering WoW subscribers will get a free copy of Diablo 3, the fact that WoW their bread and butter is even more certain.

So Blizzard is going to have to keep trying to top past WoW revenue. How will they do it?

The reaction on [gaming](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/mntv6/no_ghost_recon_future_soldier_for_pc_ubi_claims/) and [games](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/mnue1/no_ghost_recon_future_soldier_for_pc_ubi_claims/), however, has been a pretty uniform cry out of outrage and I was hoping that truegaming might be capable of a bit more of a nuanced discussion of piracy and its impact on the industry (inspired a bit by [this expression of dismay here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/mnue1/no_ghost_recon_future_soldier_for_pc_ubi_claims/c32f0rj).

Let me put my cards on the table first with an evidently unpopular opinion - piracy is a problem.  I have pirated games that I had no justification to pirate.  I wanted them, they were free and it was an easy thing to do.  

It's comforting to me to read that, according to reddit, people like me are a part of a small, insignificant minority.  Most people who pirate are apparently forced to do so because of draconian DRM, because they disagree with the corporate policy, because they have no legal means of obtaining the game, because they simply want to try the game out or because they were never going to buy the game anyways.

None of those applied to me.  Back when I didn't know how to torrent I bought games pretty regularly (secondhand or discounted, but I bought them).  When I discovered torrenting, however, there was a period of several years when I bought barely any, certainly far less than I did before.  I fell into none of the above categories - I just wanted the games in the easiest, cheapest way possible.  It's nice to know I'm some kind of bizarre freak and that there are very few like me.

Except that's not true.  You know it and I know it.  The idea that vast numbers of people will not simply take the easiest, cheapest route in most cases simply because they can strikes me as so charmingly naive that I hesitate to prick it.  But still, here are the reasons why I think that reddit's most popular arguments regarding piracy are mostly fantasy and wishful thinking:

* Piracy is caused by restrictive DRM and the fact that developers have been neglecting the platform.  If they catered to the PC and removed the DRM then piracy rates would drop.

Counterpoint - The Witcher 2.  It's hard to imagine a game that catered to the PC more, with a more supportive developer trying harder to do everything right.  If there was any truth to this argument, piracy rates of the Witcher 2 would be much, much lower than other high-DRM titles which simply was not the case.  People torrented The Witcher 2 at rates which were just about what you'd expect for a title of its caliber.

Of course, The Witcher 2 still made money.  And that's great.  Notably, though, that game came in with an established fanbase and the developer was confident of its quality.  The problem really comes in with marginal titles for which sales are not guaranteed, or where the cost/return margin gets to a point where catering to the platform no longer makes financial sense.  There's also, of course, the concern that making a product available on PC means that people will torrent it instead of buying it on the console.

* Piracy is just as prevalent on consoles.  Singling PCs out is unfair.

Sure there are torrents out there for console titles, but the difficulty and risks involved in modding a console are significantly higher for consoles than for PCs.  For the PC I've only got to run a couple of programs to get the torrented copy working.  Pirating on the console involves hardware modification that runs the risk of ruining the device, plus the added risk of later having your account banned.  It may be hard for the hard-tech crowd to understand, but for the vast majority of people hearing the phrase ""hardware modification that runs the risk of ruining your console"" alone is enough to turn people away.  The risk and knowledge necessary to pirate on a console versus on the relatively open platform of the PC are not remotely comparable. 

You also have to believe that the people who run large companies are so stupid as to get this completely wrong.  If piracy rates really are the same on consoles as on PCs then every large company would have to, by some strange coincidence, have all become filled with people who simply hate money and prefer not to capitalize on markets when capitalizing on markets is exactly what brought those companies to the position they are in.

Furthermore, even if the above _were_ true and piracy rates were the same, it might not matter.  If the entire potential market for PC games is smaller than for console games, there simply might not be enough buyers left over after the pirates to make porting a game worthwhile.

* 1 pirate does equal 1 lost sale

This is obviously true, but rather beside the point.  The problem isn't that every pirate equals a lost sale, it's that piracy _in aggregate_ results in lost sales _in aggregate_.  In other words, it doesn't matter how many pirates equate to lost sales, so long as there is an overall negative effect on the bottom line.  

And let's face it - there has got to be.  It's hard to think of a single large, traditional developer of PC games that hasn't switched to a console focus in recent years.  Are each of these independent companies somehow _mistaken_ as to what's been happening to their bottom lines?  Are they all somehow wrong to all independently and individually conclude that there's more money to be made in focusing on the console?  

Taken together, the major arguments that you see on reddit force one to hold three positions, each of which are baldly preposterous:  

* The largest and most successful companies are run by people who have no idea how to make money and have little to no clue about market size, revenue or piracy rates.

* Companies should do absolutely nothing about the piracy of their products.

* Everything is the fault of everyone _but_ the people who are getting games for free.

The fact that otherwise reasonable people have been backed into arguing these positions should alone be enough to give a person pause.  The collective refusal of the PC gaming community to place _any_  blame on pirates rather reminds of the Republican refusal to accept any sort of tax increase on anything ever - something which sensible people on the outside find astonishing but for people on the inside is a tightly clung-to article of faith.

Personally, I've had a ton of fun over the years playing games on a PC and I couldn't imagine it any other way.  Nonetheless, it's clear that the industry has been in relative (not absolute) decline as what used to be a unique platform with unique strengths is increasingly becoming an afterthought.  It annoys me when I have to deal with things like console-ized UI in Skyrim, but I'm just as annoyed with the people who pirate the game as with the company that responds to it.  It's hard to blame a company for going where the cash is because that's simply what companies do.  But for people who can afford machines that cost 2 to 3 to 4 to 5 times what a console does complaining that they can't afford to play games   ....you can do better than that.  And as a community, we can do better than gnashing our teeth like spoiled children at every bit of bad news and complaining that the fault is, once again, with absolutely everyone but ourselves.

There's a lot of debate going on, but I see a lot of stuff missing from the discussions.  The fear is that without a used game market, prices inevitably go up because Microsoft and other publishers would have a monopoly.  I think we have plenty of evidence to suggest that isn't actually the case.  The current console market is missing a key component of competition within a functional market.  

edit: [NYU did a study](http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2013/05/nyu-used-games-study/) and found that if used games were done away with, publishers would make 19% more profit.. ONLY if they reduced new game prices to about $40. But if publishers keep prices at $60, they estimate profit falls by 10% due to customers having less capital.  So don't just take my word for it.  Without retail and the used game market, publishers would basically be forced to lower prices to stay competitive.  They'd see more revenue (because they cut out the retail middleman) and you'd see lower prices.

Over the next two months there will be changes in the CSS, subreddit layout and sidebar. If something appears incorrectly/not right/screwy or just plain stupid, please tell me.

We're expecting posts that actually make the discussion. Not ""X topic. Discuss."" - if you start the conversation, bring your thoughts to the table. Make it worthwhile for people to read.

Now, when we first started we offered gamertags, PSN and Steam ID's in users flair. If there is enough interest we will get a bot system set up so users can sign up for it if they want. There isn't much else usage for the flair around here so, what else can we put in that space (if anything)?

I also want to introduce...duh duh duh duh....r/truegaming competitions. Every once in a while I will throw up a competition and its requirements and rewards in the sidebar. You can win games, vouchers, gaming merchandise and paraphernalia. This is being run as a ""good will"" system at the moment, so don't expect one everyday, since I'm not made of money. I do think it will be a bit of fun and interactivity between the community and encourage some gameplay.

A hobby of mine is 3D modelling, and I know from experience that making a good in-game model (one with exactly as many faces as it needs to have, texture maps doing the rest, detail-wise) takes a LOT of time, and when you have a game world that is tens to hundreds of square kilometers big, and you want to detail it, script its weather, add the monsters and shrubbery, make the caves/dungeons/alien ships/whatever else you populate it with, when you have to create every single item, make and balance a skill system, etcetera - it takes a real, really real big amount of time.

Why is it that game mechanics still manage to ruin the entire game, into which a lot of work has obviously been put, when it doesn't take nearly as long to program a good way to play?

I'll gladly give an example too, one that most people are probably familiar with: Skyrim. Skyrim's game world is beyond detailed and personalized, frankly, I can just get lost in it, exploring for hours, happily. However, the movement system, the combat system, everything that has to do with the actual game engine is just... so... wooden and.. bad. I would have gladly had the developers spend more time working on the engine, than making another pretty mountaintop for me to explore - I think it's worth it. The game Brink (for those of you who don't know it - it's a freerunning FPS ;D) does quite the opposite - the way your character moves in the environment is sublime - its fluidity really makes you feel like a freerunner, but the actual environments and objectives are so boring and.. well, limited, because it's a FPS. RAGE is another title that comes to mind - the weapons in that game really feel powerful, the way you move is quite satisfactory, but it's a shortass game, and it's scripted and linear beyond belief. Graphics are nice, but they cheated when they baked in all the ligthing, so an open world setting would be impossible anyway :D

Is there an actual reason developers put MUCH more time into making a game prettier, rather than making it play better?

Edit: I'm not saying that gameplay is as easy to do as graphics - I know it's a much, much more time-consuming part of developing a game, but my point is - why not spend the time you would have spent making another troll character, making more people work or one person work more on fixing the gameplay?",,False,,t5_2sgq6,1371923267.0,,,True,t3_1guxhl,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1guxhl/why_are_visually_brilliantly_designed_games/,
1358698190.0,236,self.truegaming,16xlt3,Should we apply the same copyright lifespan to videogames (life of the creator plus 70 years) that we apply to literature and movies?,l3un1t,335,99,142,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/16xlt3/should_we_apply_the_same_copyright_lifespan_to/,"Well first off, this question was inspired by /u/ysalimiri's [reply](http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/16vogv/do_you_think_emulators_for_older_systems_can_be/c7zs8ci) to [this](http://redd.it/16vogv) thread, which discussed emulators and copyright. 

Second, let's keep the discussion on how appropriately current copyright laws apply to **videogames**, why they should/shouldn't remain the same, and other discussions along this line. Don't let the discussion dissolve into bitching about any non-gaming issues simply for the sake of bitching. If you want to talk about copyright as a whole, go to /r/copyright. 

Thirdly, here's what I have to say about applying copyright lifespans to videogames:

It seems a bit strange that we apply the same copyright to videogames that we apply to literature and music. Think about it; copyright's original intention, as /u/mattahorn explains, is to ""promote science and arts. It does this by granting the creator the temporary exclusive rights to profit from their work, which incentivizes creation. So, while it does allow for a creator to profit from his work for a period of time, that isn't what it is there for.""

*I had originally stated that copyright's was originally intended to ""let the creator of a work profit from said work, while allowing it to be released in to the public domain"". Since the majority of my post revolves around that incorrect idea, I'm not going to altar any of my points. Make sure to keep this in mind when reading rest of my post.* 

Today, works produced by corporations are protected for ~~the creator's life plus seventy~~, as /u/solomute explains, ninety-five years. This is *more* then enough time for a creator to profit from a work. While over seventy years is a *long* time to wait for a work to be released into the public domain, it isn't entirely unreasonable; acclaimed works such as *1984* will be released to the public domain in 2020, and readers may still be able to take away a powerful experience. 

Now, let's think about games for a moment. Think about the lifetime of a game versus the lifetime of a book. In 2013, nobody is going to claim a twenty-year old book is ""unreadable"" because of the book's now-archaic language and style. However, with games, twenty years is a *colossal* interval of time. 

To prove this, let's compare the graphics of [Doom](http://www.gamershell.com/static/screenshots/34/226816_full.jpg) to those of [Dishonored](http://irbgamer.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Dishonored-3.jpg). There's a *major* difference in the graphics *and* aesthetics (the style) of both games, and by extension, the quality of the experience they provide to gamers today. Believe it or not, but it seems like most people would *probably* choose to play Dishonored over Doom. Most people are *probably* going to state that if Doom was first released in 2012, it wouldn't be as fun to play as Dishonored! 

**The fact of the matter is that currently, games age *much* more quickly than literature. They have a *much* shorter period of time to provide a powerful experience, in direct contrast with works of literature, which can provide powerful experiences to readers decades after such works are released.** 

**Despite this, we apply the same blanket copyright lifespan to games that we apply to literature, and this only makes sense if both forms of entertainment age equally, if both forms of entertainment have the same lifespan to sell copies.** 

This sort of copyright law restricts ""antique"" games from being legally released to the public domain. Developers/producers can release these ""dead"" games to the public domain whenever they damn well please. Before they choose to do so, consumers are restricted access to games that no longer earn a profit, and other companies are restricted from legally producing a copy of the game under their own terms, which reduces the platforms ""dead"" games can be released upon. 

Yes, there *are* games that can be considered timeless, so *yes*, developers could still earn a profit from a 20 year-old game, and gamer can still have a powerful experience. However, the disparity between a game released in 1993 vs. a game released in 2012 are *gigantic*. Retaining a copyright on *Pokemon Red* is *not* the same as retaining the copyright for *A Game of Thrones; A Song of Ice and Fire*, despite both being released in 1996. Take a quick guess at how many copies Pokemon Red has sold in 2012 in comparison to *A Game of Thrones*. Take a quick guess at how much money Nintendo would have lost *from sales of Pokemon Red* if the game was released into the public domain. 

I'm not saying that the *characters* of a game have a short lifespan. Hell, if you want an example of this, look no further than any game Nintendo has released in the past twenty years. Mario's been saving Peach for over two decades, and he's probably going to be doing so for years to come. However, Super Mario Brother for the NES still hasn't be released to the public domain, despite being released *28 years ago*. What is the justification for Nintendo still holding the copyright to Super Mario Bros (NES)? How does this copyright ""protect"" Nintendo's sales of the game, while allowing it to be released into the public domain?

**Tl;dr and conclusion;** It seems that the length of time for a game's copyright to expire is far too long. Gaming changes and vidoegames ""die"" far more quickly than works in other forms of entertainment, such as literature. Because of this, it makes little sense that the copyright for videogames take such a long time to expire.

I did not bother to complete the main story in Oblivion, but did every guild/faction/daedric side quest. That said, there's been a disturbing trend in The Elder Scrolls series, one of many: you have the ability to do damn near anything in the world, and none of it matters.

It just hit me as I did Azura's quest, where you can either bring her the Star and have it fixed, or work with Nelacar and turn it into the Black Star. I realized there was literally no consequence for me, as a Dunmer, to steal and pervert an artifact of my race's patron deity. None whatsoever. This should be an event with consequences, with the wrath of the being that brought Nerevar back to punish the Tribunal falling on my head. ""Nope"", Bethesda says, ""enjoy your sacred artifact that can now hold human souls.""

My concerns were further compounded by the results of the Mephala chain, where I was quite literally able to waltz into a castle, talk to a kid, pick a pocket (at 16 skill on a conscious and awake target), and walk out with the Ebony Blade all unmolested. Nobody thinks to check on it? Farengar and Balgruuf KNOW the Ebony Blade is there, and ignore that it is now missing?

Those are but two examples of MANY in Skyrim that illustrate a serious problem: what good is the ability to do anything in the world, if all of it means nothing? I'm not saying I need the world to suddenly and irrevocably change, but there need to be consequences for actions. Taking the Ebony Blade should put Dragonsreach at a heightened state of alert. Betraying Azura should have her do her damnedest to make my life a living hell. Instead, it's a matter of ""Do I take the Black Star instead of Azura's Star so I don't have to hunt down Black Soul Gems?""

Choice and consequence in TES are damn near non-existent now, with the exception of the civil war and Dark Brotherhood chains. At least with the Dark Brotherhood you have the option at the very start to decline the offer to join in a spectacular manner and hunt them down. Boom, branching options leading to two different outcomes! I can't speak much on the civil war chain, as I'm holding off on that one for now. In general, though, choice and consequence is damn near non-existent. The typical choice is ""Do you accept this mission? Y/N"" and the typical consequence is ""You receive [item]"". By mostly sticking to this, the rich possibilities of the world of TES are cheapened.

With that said, here's my question to you, TG: Does choice matter if every path leads to the same conclusion and same consequences?",,False,,t5_2sgq6,False,,,True,t3_mm3zn,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/mm3zn/tes_postmorrowind_you_can_do_anything_but_it_all/,

1345038815.0,234,self.truegaming,y9ek3,My first impressions of Counter Strike: Global Offensive,blu2th,329,95,218,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/y9ek3/my_first_impressions_of_counter_strike_global/,"Any time I've stopped playing something for a long period of time, it's always my very first memory of it that draws me back in. I realised this a few years ago and ever since I've strived to get myself in the best frame of mind before playing something new. With some releases it's quite easy. For example, Skyrim and Portal 2 could have been released the day after all of my friends had perished in a tragic accident and I'd have still been in the right place to enjoy them. With others, it can take a few days, sometimes a week or so or some booze to get me to a place where I'm going to be happy recording some new memories. This isn't a reflection of how good the game is either, this is all to do with my perception before I've had any experience of it first hand, and I don't think any hype or lack thereof has ever affected my ability to be eager to jump into a game.

That said when Counter Strike: Global Offensive was announced, I was a little curious, a little scared and not much else. What it really drove home for me was how old Counter Strike: Source and the Source engine was now. I wouldn't have said I was terribly excited about it. But these things do change, and after a few months of reading a few blog posts and threads from people who had made it into the closed beta my interest began to perk up. The main reason for this was the sheer volume of complaints beta tester were making about the game. It was fascinating watching the development process play out in such an open environment but without having any knowledge of the product beyond eye witness accounts. It resulted in the only possible reaction. As my hungry eyes flew over countless bleating posts about recoil balance issues, my head was desperately shouting: “We have got to try this!”

My first memory of CS:GO will always be that I jumped onto a server as soon as it had installed, bought some weapons, ran around a familiar dusty map and killed 4 members of the enemy team before taking a bullet to the back of the head. I'm happy with that. I think I'll always be happy with it. I also earned an achievement for this spectacular introduction to the new iteration of the Counter Strike franchise, but I'm not sure that will attach itself to the rest of the memory. I already knew it was an achievement and I didn't need the game to tell me that, but all the same we're used to our games keeping a record of how awesome we are these days.

So what do I think of it? I think I like it. It has shapes and sounds I recognise that make me comfortable but there are still enough new bits to keep this from looking like a HD Texture pack. It has avoided the majority of modern day shooter trends to keep itself individual. I was elated when I discovered clicking my right mouse button didn't bring the AK47 and kickstart my magnify eyes. I was equally happy to get shot over and over again, as I did after my initial burst of brilliance, without my screen caking over with jam and chunks of liver. Valve know who they are making this for, and they aren't afraid of ignoring what most consider to be industry standards. I like this. It keeps the pace frantic because no one's staring down the iron sights of their sidearm whilst hiding behind a box. Instead they're running around, clearing rooms and checking corners and letting the action play out in rapid fire fights when the enemy is found. The closest thing to stealth is walking or crouching, and the latter will only be done for accuracy. This is Counter Strike, and these are the things I feared for when the game was first announced. 
What Valve had included has been well executed. There's a quick join option which cuts out the need for the server browser. You tell it what kind of game you're looking for and it finds it for you. A few items below that in the menu is the server browser. No one has been spurned here, everyone is catered for. Along with two new game modes, there are two variants on the old Counter Strike model. Casual and Competitive. In casual you can move through your team mates, friendly fire is off by default and everyone starts with body armour. On the Counter Terrorist side, everyone gets a defusal kit. Competitive mode sees a return to traditional Counter Strike values in terms of team attacking, earning extra protection and being more challenging for those players who want it that way. 
It's difficult to see who hasn't been catered for here. There are obvious touches included for the console releases but there are still all of the PC counterparts we've come to expect and you don't need to route around anywhere to find them.
With regards to gameplay: it's Source. Anyone who's played a lot of CS:S is going to find it easier slipping in to this. It's not a comfy old slipper you've worn around the house for a few years, but it is a new shoe you won't get blisters from. The new weapons are easy to get a feel for and the old ones haven't changed drastically from their predecessors. Anyone who is entering in to Counter Strike with this game shouldn't have much difficulty.

It talks about the oh so controversial part of the new Tomb Raider, where someone mistakenly said that a bad guy would attempt to rape Lara Croft. The article goes on to say that it is not in fact rape.

What really got me about it though was the comment section. Nearly every single one was of people complaining that our video games are not allowed to show rape, but they can show murder. Initially this seems like a fair argument, but [this video](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/jimquisition/5972-Rape-vs-Murder) demonstrates what I believe is a very good counter argument to that. One of the primary arguments in that video is the lasting effects of rape on a victim - If you get killed, you won't be affected by killing people in games, but rape will no doubt haunt you, especially if it shows up in a game.

I admit, I'm a male who has never and likely will never experience fear of rape, rape, or its aftereffects. And while I don't want to make generalizations, I wouldn't doubt that the majority of the commenters on that PCgamer article are in the same situation. There is a lack of understanding of what those after effects would feel like, that haunting feeling.

I'm posting this in r/truegaming because I think it would be valuable if there were some sort of game that explored these aftereffects. Not necessarily in a direct manner, rather through some sort of metaphor. A game where something happens to your character beforehand or sometime during the game that continues to follow them, and loom over them. Something that changes your interactions with everyone.

Now, I don't have any specific ideas as to how this would work, and there are definitely some issues that need to be ironed out. Metaphorically simulating the aftereffects of rape as a way to understand why rape in video games is a bad thing seems counter-intuitive. Perhaps it is, and I am entirely wrong. 

That being said, I personally think that the commenters on PCgamer need some manner to understand, and I think that a game would be an ideal way to connect with them in that manner.

Please, give your thoughts and comments on the matter.

EDIT: I did not mean to imply that female on male/male on male rapes do not occur. Rather I was stating that I as a male have never worried about being sexually molested in any way, whereas many females I know do worry about that.

EDIT2: I don't mean to say that I want there to be a big rape scene in the middle of the game. What I would primarily be interested in seeing is some sort of representation of the after effects that linger. The metaphorical rape could happen before it even starts, I just think some exploration of how someone may view the world afterwords would be interesting (I keep using the word interesting because I can't really think of any other way to describe my feelings - good or fascinating seem in ill-taste when talking about rape.)

Something about Nintendo's announcement of Super Mario 3D World bothered me, and it's taken me a while to figure out what: If SM3DW is the next ""core"" Mario game, ""traditional"" 3D platformers might really be gone.

The summer of 1998 was when I first got into console gaming. I was 11 at the time, and my parents had bought me a Nintendo 64. After years of goofing around with various computer games over the years, the first genre I became really familiar with was the 3D platformer. Banjo-Kazooie, Super Mario 64 and Donkey Kong 64 were the games that turned me into a ""gamer."" For 15 years my first and favorite genre has been the 3D platformer.

""3D platformer"" is a bit of an odd genre. Neither word in that name actually addresses what makes it unique. The skill of timing your running, jumping and attacking is still needed as in traditional platformers, but where in 2D platformers those skills are used to reach the end of a obstacle course within a time limit, 3D platformers require those skills to complete missions: Defeat King Bob-omb, free Clanker the shark, get to the top of the lighthouse. Each successful completion of a mission awards the player with one of the many MacGuffins required to beat the game. Other MacGuffins can be collected, and certain 3D platformers leaned heavier on this collection aspect than others.

It could be argued that what made 3D platformers unique was a result of decisions Nintendo made with Super Mario 64, and the industry reacting accordingly. It's true that you don't need to complete missions or collect Jiggies to be a platformer in three dimensions-- Super Mario 3D Land proved that to us. And for a long time now I worried that the simple fact that the name ""3D platformer"" promises nothing about mission-based gameplay means the industry wouldn't have any hesitation in dropping that aspect. I think that might have finally happened. For years I was able to say, ""3D platformers aren't really as popular as they used to be, but at least Nintendo is still making them."" I can no longer say that.

Normally I might look to the indie scene for hope, and 2D platformers are easy to make, relatively speaking. Indie-developed 2D platformers are quite common, but 3D games are much more time and resource consuming. 3D indie games certainly exist, but they aren't nearly as common, and I don't see any way their development could get much easier-- adding another dimension just makes things more complicated, even if you have the resources and time.

Even if they were easy to make, I worry that there isn't much reverence for the genre. ""Collect-a-thon"" games aren't usually seen in the best light, and while there has been a recent surge in popularity of N64-era Rare platformers (something I have been ready and waiting for for the better part of a decade), I'm just not hearing much buzz in the community about new mission-based, 3D platformers on the horizon, beyond things like Rare alumni talking about making a Kickstarter for a ""Banjo-esque"" game, or trying to buy back the Conker rights from Microsoft. I'm seeing a lot of talk, a lot of pipe dreams, but not a lot of action.

Is this genre dead in the water? Are its fans too few and far between to worth noting? I'm a firm believer in the idea that no genre in this industry is dead forever, but I worry that 3D platformers aren't even seen as a legitimate genre to begin with. They might just be seen as a fad-- the industry tried to copy Super Mario 64 in the mid and late 90's, some found success, others failed, and the industry moved on. 

I'd hate to see my favorite genre delegated to a footnote.

As many of us know, there was a lot backlash against Grand Theft Auo IV for its realistic/gritty tone and streamlining of features and with Grand Theft Auto V on the foreseeable horizon, I have to ask: What will it take for Rockstar to make it worthy of this new ""era""?

Obviously a lot of the audience demanded the missing features of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas to re-appear in the fifth installment (bicycles, jets, fitness etc which all appear to be back) but now we're exactly where we were with San Andreas albeit with the RAGE engine. What do we need to push it to that next step?

* In my opinion a big step forward would be a form of story co-op, not some half-arsed effort that ended up being in Fable 2, but a truly refined co-op with benefits for both of the contributing players.

* Decisions that matter. Killing Dwayne did not have a lot of consequences attached to it, the outcome was either a new house and Dwayne in your contacts or a whole lot of money. Considering the fact most of the audience detested the ""friends"" mechanic, it almost seemed like a burden letting him live.

FPS was king; Quake, Half-Life, CS, Unreal, and Tribes were the main games people played (some people still played Doom, but not many). Movement in these games was fast, fluid, and unintended exploits such as bunnyhopping and skiing made them even faster. Modders added in features that made the games even more awesome, with tons of new maps, models, skins, and mods released daily.

While some of this is still present today, I still find that nothing (other than the games I have named) can quite scratch that itch I have for twitch shooting goodness. Most games today try to be like Call of Duty (which, while fast, is not a movement-based FPS, and encourages cover, unlike Quake, which emphasizes moving fast as hell at all times).

Even so called ""old-school"" modern games don't really compare. Tribes: Ascend is slower, has smaller maps, and lacks modding capability, unlike its previous counterparts. UT3 was slow compared to UT2004, which was still more sluggish than UT99. HL2DM is in the middle of dying, and wasn't as fast as HL1DM. Quake Live lacks modding support, and is dying. TF2 is nowhere near as fast as TFC. 

At least CS is mostly unchanged, but it was the slowest of the games I mentioned.

But still, the classic twitch shooters I named above all have dying communities, and are at the ends of their respective lifespans.

So, my question is this: What happened to twitch shooters? When did the decline start, what caused it, and will they ever come back?

Was it console gaming? Controllers are certainly not as good as a mouse and keyboard for split-second reactions.

Was it the release of Call of Duty and its success driving developers to cater to a different audience?

Or, rather, did the communities tear themselves apart with elitism and the high skill ceiling driving away new players?

I'm really not sure, and I'm hoping that some people in here could clear these questions up.

For reference, here's a video demonstrating the type of movement and gameplay I'm talking about: [Get Quaked](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcoEVGTpLBA)

I've been converting everyone's cities to my religion, trying to pass some world congress laws that annoyed most people, and generally just having fun annoying the crap out of everyone. I've been denounced a thousand times over, but nobody has actually attacked me yet, because my military score is so much higher than everyone elses. 

I started thinking to myself ""This is stupid, I want some action but I don't want to be an outright aggressor, this would never happen in the real world."" 

Ah, but then I thought that's not exactly true, is it? When one nation is so powerful that it just goes around pushing too many buttons, the countries you annoy don't actually wage formal warfare upon you anymore. They realise that a straight-up war will get their butts handed to them, and thus don't wage war, but start to utilize other more-effective tactics, such as... state-sponsored terrorism.

As of right now, there doesn't seem to be a way for my fellow civilizations to punish me for my deplorable actions. I've never played on Marathon before and wasn't accustomed to how much easier it was to play, being able to micromanage everything so much more effectively, so I'm more than likely to quit the game and start over on a higher difficulty. But I can't help but wonder if the Civilization franchise should potentially consider implementing this real-world ""solution"" to the problem I'm running into now. 

Granted, I understand this is a controversial topic, and I'm sure that having the ability to pull off state-sponsored terrorist attacks would more than likely ban the game or cause quite a ruckus, but honestly the game already allows us to utilize nuclear weapons. Is it really objectively that much worse to allow this as well?

I'm not even sure the feature should exist myself; it was just a thought I had as I was playing along and decided I'd ask others to see what they think. Part of me wants to support it, because ""Hey, it's a real world issue we're dealing with, and something that shouldn't be glossed over in a game supposedly about simulating the world"". But then again, Civ 4 dealt with Global Warming, for example, a real issue we're dealing with today, and I'm glad it was removed from Civ5 because it made the endgame far too annoying to play.

I however think there is a larger problem at hand, and that is of the ability for not only reviewers but also players to think critically about the things that they love. There is a distinct lack of it in this industry, both on the professional and the player level. Games will receive great scores even though they have jarring flaws, it is conveniently ignored, downplayed or swept under a rug, all in the name of the greater fun. Because the game is a fun experience, people will ignore the big picture and only judge the game subjectively out of their own tastes. Everyone becomes a yes-man, and the one who complains that the game feels repetitive or lacking of content at some areas are painted as a whiner or someone needlessly picky. 

Is it not our duty if we love something to pick it apart and judge it critically for what it is, instead of allowing ourselves to be clouded by sentimentality?

My interpretation of the different races is that they are simply different subsets of the Human race's traits and that is what makes it possible for us to bond with them even though we really do not get to know them very well.

What I mean by that is that the different races seem to be one or two different Human expressions taken to an extreme and made the focal point of the race and this is what makes them relatable. So:

1. The Krogan race are Human Rage and Lust personified
2. The Salarians are Scientific inquiry and Curiosity
3. The Hanar are Religion and Obedience
4. The Asari are Compassion and Empathy
5. The Elcor are Afterthought and Carefulness
6. The Volus are Greed and Powerlust
7. The Turians are Discipline and Military might
8. The Quarians are Wanderlust and Exploration
9. The Geth are Technology and Unity
10. The Drell are Industry and Progress

This is also quite interesting if you look at the ""enemy"" races in the game. 

[1. The Rachni are a hive intelligence and as a Human that is not something we can relate to in the same way as we are all individuals.](/spoiler) 

[2. The Reapers are a machine intelligence which while similar to the ""frenemy"" race Geth is still very different in my mind as they want to exterminate all life.](/spoiler) 

[3. The Geth are a newer machine intelligence and still retain some Human (Quarian/biological) semblance in both their logic and ways. They are not out to kill all sentient life in the galaxy, at least not yet, and as such are more relatable than the Reapers. ](/spoiler) 

[4. The Collectors also seems unrelatable but that might be because they are introduced as bad guys the first time you hear about them. Otherwise they might be seen as Self improvement personified.](/spoiler)

[5. The Batarians are in my opinion Pride and Anarchy personified. I believe this is so due to the fact that their Pride makes them withdraw from ""Civilized"" society and head out into the barbarian lands where there is no rule of law. A single blow to their ego is enough for them to abandon all diplomacy and go on the warpath. ](/spoiler)

[6. The Vorcha are in my opinion our Survival instinct and Perseverance. If you take into consideration that they live where others cannot live, eat what others would throw away, or even not classify as food, and when cornered they will lash out like a trapped animal](/spoiler)

Now I don't claim that this is the be all end all of the races and it would be interesting to me to find out what you think about this theory. Is there anything to it or is it simply my Human brain trying to find a pattern that isn't there?

It's extremely immersive, almost lifelike. When the barber takes the scissors out the back of my neck was tingling. Compared to virtual 7.1 headphones or even actual 5.1 headphones, it's miles beyond. There is no competition.

When Blizzard released Diablo 2, it changed the world of PC gaming. For many years after, hack n' slash and RPG's in general were compared to Diablo 2 to determine quality. But what made it so engaging?

I found the gothic elements of the game to be the drawing feature. The player is thrown into a macabre world, with demons lurking in every dark shadow. These demons seem more terrifying because of the perceived mortality of the player character.

The character feels almost naked at the start, with nothing but a simple weapon and a basic attack to start. As you progress and gain skills and equipment, the monsters quickly become tougher and more numerous. The Blood Moore is easy, but it feels like the NPCs are sending you on a suicide mission to kill Blood Raven.

The items maintain realistic aesthetics up to the higher levels; there are no embellished breastplates and very few colorful weapons. You feel like a small hero in a huge world, making due with what you find. There are no glowing skulls to keep your shoulders safe- a strong demon might come along and lop off your arm at a moment's notice. 

The player makes up for this vulnerability by advancing through the skill tree. Choices must be made wisely, as there is no way to reverse a commitment to stat points or a spot on the skill tree. I spent many hours debating about a spot on one of these trees. However, this customization gives the player real attachment to their character. This is my Paladin, there are many like it, but this one is mine.

**Diablo 3: Gothic meets World of Warcraft**

When Diablo 3 came along a decade later, it had some big shoes to fill. Many players were disappointed with what Diablo 3 had to offer. Criticism started before Beta, when the first screenshots were released. They appeared too bright and too colorful. There are no rainbows in Sanctuary, for God's sake!

To me, the reason was simple. While Blizzard developed Diablo 3, it was constantly updating and developing content for World of Warcraft. The themes from WoW were bleeding over, and Gothic was becoming Hot Topic. 

The characters in Diablo 3 start off powerful. Their armor is stylized, and almost immediately, the character is killing waves of zombies. As NPCS are quickly slaughtered in the Inn, our character just as effortlessly slaughters the enemy.

It is only exaggerated from there. Armor becomes more detailed and elaborate. Weapons glow with power. Shoulders become more spikey and eventually glow themselves. The character's skills become increasingly powerful. The Diablo 2 heroes wouldn't stand a chance against this lot of prismatic protagonists.

The only way to keep the escalation of arms equal is to create more powerful monsters. Starting in nightmare mode, unique monsters start to have multiple powerful and bizarre abilities. I remember cutting through hordes of enemies, only to be felled in a matter of seconds by a unique. I wasn't terrified; I was angry. I was a god among men a second ago, and one demon a slightly different color than the other dozen killed me in a few seconds? It felt cheap.

My whole character felt cheap. They gave me free reign of all the abilities my class could have. Unfortunately, only one build per each class was viable in Nightmare mode and beyond. There was nothing making my character unique. With so few skill possibilities, it was easy to find a statistically optimized build. 

**Path of Exile: bringing Gothic back**

Path of exile became available with little fanfare. I found out about it not from a press release or a web banner, but from the whispers or fellow gamers, ""No, it's *really* like Diablo 2!"" 

The second I created my character, I felt vulnerable again. My character washes up, half drowned on a dark continent. He's half naked, and grabs a driftwood club for a weapon. He fights for his life against the bloated, resurrected bodies of his former shipmates. As he fights his way to safety, he picks up scraps of armor to wear, a shield make of old ship planks, and a salt rusted helmet. The first boss made me say, ""Oh shit!"" as the giant pulled a sword from his own gut and started hacking away at my character.

The theme stays true late into the game. Eventually, there are full sets of platemail, but my god, is it a sight for sore eyes when it drops. Even when worn, it doesn't transform the character into a demigod or fashion diva. 

The game mechanics keep a good pace. The monsters always hurt you. As a melee class, the constantly refilling health flasks are constantly drained to replace your lost health. The unique monsters are tough. A careless decision could cost you your life. However, if I died I felt like I made a mistake. It never felt like a cheap shot from the bad guy.

The massive skill tree truly made my character my own. It was overwhelming at first, but the longer I stared at it, I started to see what skills would mesh well together, and what path I would have to take to get them. The massive amount of choices results in some unique builds. I've never seen a Witch build like mine.

All in all, I felt attached to my characters again. They are vulnerable, and only a few hours removed from the waterlogged exiles they started as. They are skillful survivors, however. Their particular skill sets meet my play style, and I feel invested in them and their story.

Now, let's flip things for the positive and talk about those qualities in games that are powerful enough to make you reconsider your feelings towards a game or that are disproportionately *great* for you to experience.

Some of mine:

* **Fun Beyond Winning** 

I brought this up in a thread yesterday, but I enjoyed Blur *even when I wasn't winning*. It was still a blast to be in the pack of cars all firing/blocking powerups and jockeying for the win that, even if I came in last, I still loved the experience I had.

In Killing Floor, the simple act of shooting the game's guns feels *good*. They feel like they have weight and substance, moreso than in other FPSes I've played. Even if our team loses to the always-hungry zombies, I don't mind because I legitimately enjoyed what I was doing for the duration of the match, and that *isn't* spoiled by a failed outcome.

Whenever the mechanics of a game are engaging/rewarding/fulfilling for the player, I feel like you see this (and it's different for everybody, of course). It takes a lot of the focus away from the outcome-based satisfaction we can tend to center ourselves around (quests! achievements! unlocks!) and lets you enjoy the *process* of the game itself.

*Other examples: Mario Party, Terraria, Just Cause 2*

* **That Curious Intersection of Narrative and Mechanics** 

Driver: San Francisco wasn't a great driving game. The physics were kind of wonky, the challenges were often derivative, and the AI rubber-banding was pretty apparent.

But Driver: San Francisco was a *great game* because of how it tied its storyline into the gameplay. Centering the narrative around the main character's ability to possess other drivers and change cars at will seems like a straight-up gimmick, but the game fleshes it out and uses it in creative and interesting ways. The plot owns its own hokiness and plunges you into its absurdity, meshing the outrageousness of the car-shifting mechanic with the missions you complete.  Half the appeal of the game for me was *trying to anticipate what the developers would do next*, and the other half was watching it play out *better* than my expectations predicted.

Analogue: A Hate Story tells a story by having you interact with a computer AI to get logs from a spaceship. It makes sense to think of the content of those logs as the main narrative, but the game doesn't stop at just making the AI a functional game mechanic -- it meshes the AI into the story. The story is also *your uncovering* of those logs and *your interactions* with the computer as you figure out what's in them.

Too often in games we think of story and gameplay as separate (just think of the gameplay-cutscene-gameplay-cutscene cadence we see so often), or one existing to the detriment of the other, but I think developers are continually uncovering ways to link the two, to the benefit of the medium. We're getting lots of really compelling, really creative experiences that wouldn't be possible in any other format, and that's *awesome*.

*Other examples: The Stanley Parable, Botanicula, Gemini Rue*

* **Diverse Characters**

The writing for Fallout: New Vegas and Borderlands 2 both took big steps up in my mind when I encountered queer characters that were given the same authorial treatment in the plot as any others. They weren't reduced to a single dimension, used for titillation, or played off as stereotypes for laughs/judgment. To the Moon, without spoilers, offers some pretty powerful humanization to its characters that's centered around traits and experiences we don't normally encounter in gaming.

The more games we see where the characters are *meaningful* and not just *functional*, the more we're getting to see all the different brush-strokes of humanity appear in what we play. Yes, there are definitely still some issues, but I feel like the *motion* of the medium is headed in a positive direction. We're now at a place where we can think critically about the depictions and conventions that we're used to, and we're also at a place where the people making games are choosing to broaden the spread of narratives to encompass the stories and people who often go underrepresented and overlooked.

*Other examples: The Blackwell Series, Spec Ops: The Line, The Walking Dead*

Me and a friend were playing on Taviana. I pretty quickly found an AK in Sabina, then used it to blow up a car full of really geared dudes that tried to run me over. After we looted the car and corpses we moved outside of town with our new gear and set up a roadblock with a few tank traps. We ambushed two more vehicles that I baited into the area with promises of sweet, sweet newbie. (Basically I was just like ""hurf durf I'm new, someone help me"" and a bunch of people came running. To kill me me help me, we'll never know)

DayZ seems to be like a free-form version of Spec Ops: The Line in that it forces you to ask yourself if what you're doing is OK just because ""it's a videogame so whatever, bro."" In this case I find it even more effective, since your hand is never forced by linear design, as it is in Spec Ops.

1343109136.0,223,self.truegaming,x26jp,Sandbox vs Playground games,cjet79,299,76,109,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/x26jp/sandbox_vs_playground_games/,"I had this idea while back. Many games that are called sandbox games could be better described as playground games. 

In playground games there is a large open world and you can go do different activities within the world, but you don't really alter the fundamental structure of the world (unless it is done through a specially sanctioned activity). Buildings can't be blown up or built, landscapes are unalterable. Examples of playground games include the Grand Theft Auto series, Saints row series, and the Just Cause series.

Sandboxes are also generally open world that allow you to go explore them, but they are different because the player can alter the fundamental structures of the world. Well known examples would be minecraft, dwarf fortress, or universe sandbox. 

The reason why I think this distinction matters is that sandboxes are very difficult for large studios to make, and playground games are very difficult for small studios (or indie developers) to make. If you see a studio stepping outside of these boundaries I would be cautious. The reason why studio size matters is that a playground needs to be filled with human created content. The human created content offers a consistent experience for different customers and minimizes the risk that certain parts of the game will be broken or not fun for players. A small studio doesn't have the manpower to create enough content for an engaging playground experience, and a large studio can't risk sales based on an inconsistent or less interesting player experience.

There are exceptions, and I think these exceptions tend to occur when a studio has built two games in one. Linden labs is a largerish studio that produced a sandbox playground hybrid. Second life has a real-estate market that is very much not a sandbox since it represents the developer's income. But areas within Second life could easily qualify as a miniature sandbox, where many fundamental aspects of the environment can be altered.

I'd like to hear other people's thoughts on this.

TL;DR:

Playground = GTA

Sandbox = Minecraft

The post [on /r/games](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/rvi31/notch_f2p_is_a_scam/) immediately swallowed downvotes (even though the net voting seems to be more ""controversial"" than negative) but also 100+ comments, mostly defending F2P.

I'm always baffled by how protective reddit is of F2P. I've written countless posts about why I think F2P is a bad model and even TF2 doing it wrong. I actually even get upvotes, often, because, dare I say, my reasons to think so are so blatantly obvious that even the biggest supporters of F2P have to acknowledge them. But the overall vibe seems to be that F2P is great or at least when it's ""done right"". As if ""competitiveness""/balance is all that matters and spending 100 hours in-game is anywhere near getting things for ""free"". ""Pay-to-win"" is just the tip of the iceberg and easily avoidable by clever companies, I'm talking about ""pay-to-have-fun""/""pay-to-avoid-grinding"".

I'll just lazily copy my most recent rant about it:

&gt;I've never seen it done right. Never. I was at first excited when the trend started (It's ""free*"", right?) but the more of those I tried the more clearly I saw the pattern. You can't do ""freemium"" without ""motivating"" players to pay. What is that ""motivation""? Making your game tedious and annoying unless you pay.

&gt;Here's what I could accept: Give me the option to pay a normal full price and have me unlock everything that way. Basically, that's the argument, right? Instead of getting the full game, you get an extended demo and can invest as much as you want to get advanced content. But it's never like that. It's not a linear scale towards the traditional cost of a game. Not even considering ongoing developer support. It's downright strange how consistently that's the case.

&gt;You always get 80% of a game for free and the last 20% is priced at somewhere beyond $500 split up in lots of tiny microtransactions. Or literally infinite cost for making things faster, avoiding grinding, etc. You have two extremes: Endless grinding/waiting for free or overpriced microtransactions to skip it. In-between there should be the option to just pay traditional full-price money to unlock everything. But that never ever happens. No game does that. None that I came across. $50 gets you a pack of maybe a dozen items.

&gt;Freemium is a full-commitment game design decision. You can't slap it onto any genre without turning it into a ""freemium version"" of it, without affecting its pacing, feel and design philosophy. It's by far my most hated trend in gaming, I'd take any EA/Activision launch-day DLC over it. 

In short:

F2P adds grinding and waiting to games in order to sell you the ability to skip the grinding and waiting for an inappropriate fee. It doesn't ""replace"" traditional purchases because in its ""micro""-transactions there is more cost hidden than any full-price cost of non-F2P games. And they're mostly designed to never feel ""complete"".

You don't even have to go [full Tapfish](http://kotaku.com/the-daily-show/), although the Zynga model is just the most shameless implementation of the system. If other companies do it, they mostly just hide the same principle in slightly more elegant ways.

The start of it in the train station was awesome, i *was* in it and felt implicated (as far as it's possible at the very beginning of a game). Gordon Freeman wasn't escaping the soldiers, *i* was escaping them.
The fight against striders (especially at the end of ep 2) were all huge and very rewarding once finished.

I have some ideas why i founded it as immersive. The fact that you never leave gordon freeman's view certainly is a big part of it. You never have to go to menus (exept maybe at the very start to bind keys such) or watch cut scenes.

The scale is another reason. Everything feel big as opposed to many games where nothing seems really imposing. I don't know why it feels this way and it may be only me but even in the last CoD the New York part didn't seem that imposing to me. This makes the fight against the Striders much more impressive, same for the travels across landscapes.

A bit related to the previous point is that everything in the game isn't completely ""compressed"". What i mean is that not everywhere you are in the game contain ennemies, NPCs or plot related buildings; many locations are just to go from A to B.

Finally, a very big thing for the immersion in the game is that it is all done at once. I mean by that that you are never teleported from one place to another to skip a travel or from one period of time to another to skip time while Gordon Freeman (you) is doing something else. This makes the player aware of everything his avatar does, without leaving a part of the story blank.

(also, haven't played any other Deus Ex)

TL:DR I love Deus Ex and I want to talk about it!


Pros:

* Graphics, while completely dated, they still look ~~GOOD~~ NOT BAD. Not only do they not detract from the immersion, but also, the gritty textures actually enhance the...

* Amazing visual style! Liberty island kinda sucks and looks very generic, but from the UNATCO HQ and Hell's Kitchen and onwards everything looks completely beutiful, detailed and generally believable.

* No copy paste level design! Remember that game where every dundgeon looks exactly like the previous one? (Yes Bethesda and [bioware](http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/qzbgc/playing_the_original_deus_ex_for_the_first_time/c41pou6), I'm looking at you). Well, forget about that! If you give me a Deus Ex screenshot (that is not in a ventilation shaft :P ), I can tell you exactly where it was taken, just by memory. Now couple that with the...

* Pretty huge gameplay, semi-open worlds and very intricate full of secret paths and areas that just put my sense of direction to work. Not much to say here. I just cleared the Versalife level 1 labs and I was pretty stunned at how huge and and at the same time detailed they were.

* Fucking ROLE PLAYING! Lvling up and getting lost in statistics about character customization are not ""role playing"". Actually *having a conversation* and having your decisions affect the story and the other characters in the game, that is role playing. Deus Ex does that. The voice acting for your character also helps a ton.

* Non-linear story telling! So there's a boss fight at some point. You might kill them and they're gone, or you might fail, get captured and have to face them later.  And all this only if you have earlier decided to join the faction that fights against them. :O :O O.o WUT?! EDIT: However, regarding Paul Denton: [Does he have to die at the 'Ton hotel? I tried to go gung-ho all guns blazing out the front door with him but it was hard with all the stealth stuff I was using. I'll probably revist that after the game ends.](/spoiler) Also, after that, [I get captured and taken to the MJ12 facility (where I first hear Daedalus in my head).](/spoiler) The moment I [step out the main door and](/spoiler) realize I where I am, I just paused in amazement! Very powerful moment with a very smart buildup, like puzzle pieces falling in place all at once giving you an epiphany.  



* Cyberpunk theme. This one is purely subjective and a matter of personal taste, but I like it! Social and political comentary that isn't too preachy, dystopia, cyborgs, robots, AI, nanotechnology, transhumanism, conspiracy theories, big-ass c0mput0rz, It's hard to go wrong with such a premisse.

* And to seal the deal: Completely captivating soundtrack. (I got the game from gog where they give you the complete soundtrack along with the game and I've been listening to it a lot :D )


Minor nit-picky, half-assed complaints:

* I can buy stuff from a bunch of vendors. I can't sell any of my stuff. :( meh..

* I would prefer seperate keys for action and holstering a weapon/item. ""Gothic"" (and maybe some others that I don't recall) did this right! This way, when you don't hold anything and you press the holster key, it takes out the last used weapon. *Very* practical.



I'm now at 20+ hours of gameplay (just cleared Versalife lvl 1 labs) and I don't want this game to end, but even when it does, I will have a lot of places to revisit and a lot of choices to reconsider. I'm so thrilled that I just wanted to share this with someone out there so thnx for reading :)

- Skyrim is gods gift to women, men, children and several species of dogs. People post on message boards about why the game is so amazing. Video game reviewers praise the title for being innovative and a step in the right direction for the medium. Anecdotal stories are spread around about gamers epic battle with Giants or the undead. 

All rejoice. 

Mid December, 2011.

- It's been over a month now, and you start to see cracks in the armor that surrounded Skyrim. You find comments on message boards with people dissecting why its a horrible game, or why the product was flawed compared to its predecessors. ""Purists"" hold up the mighty Morrowind as an infallible device that Skyrim failed to meet by miles and miles. 

Somehow, we've all been duped..

This has happened before, you know. When Oblivion game out there was blanket praise for the title for about.. a month or two, and then countless posts and editorials arise about how flawed a product it is. Even when Morrowind was first revealed I caught gamers claiming that Arena and Daggerfall were better titles. 

Why does this happen? Why the honeymoon period? Why the backlash following it? 

I've seen posts of people who have played Skyrim for over 100 hours trying to tell others that its a bad game.. how is that even possible? If you have fun with a title, then that's sort of all that matters.  

But I want to know what you think.

Nevertheless, as VR-enabling devices like the Oculus Rift become ever more viable, should we start getting worried? And for what, society, or gaming?",StezzerLolz,326,109,129,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/154859/the_accusation_that_video_games_normalise_and/,"Mos entertainment, ultimately, is about portraying a different, artificial reality, and letting us experience that to a greater or lesser extent. It's a tradition many thousands of years old, starting with oral storytelling, progressing through the written word to literature, music and theatre, and, in the last 150 years, reaching a point where we can tailor this portrayal to maximise it's effectiveness, through the medium of film. Then, in the last 50 years, we have made yet another step towards immersion with the advent of 'video games', literally virtual worlds that we can interact with to the full extent of their capabilities. And, every step of the way, from the invention of analogue to the invention of digital, the more socially conservative have decried each step of the process as morally degenerate, due to each new medium's capability to impress upon us the possibility of something different. It was true of film, it is *certainly* true of video games, and, I would be ready to bet, it was true of universal literacy.

There has always, however, been something that mitigated and nullified these protestations, which is our capacity to be self aware. It is always claimed that, by being subjected to a reality in which violence in particular and other social taboos to a lesser extent are normalised or indeed glorified, we will, on a subconscious level, accept that these same rules apply to our reality. The problem with this is, of course, that, no matter how engrossed I am in a film or video game, I am still aware that I am myself and where I am, merely watching it all play out on a screen in front of me. I am self aware, cognisant of my own position in relation to my environment, and thus cognisant that my environment is not that which my conscious mind is concerned with. We know that, although it's OK to kill someone in a video game, it's not OK in real life because the game is just that: a game.

VR, however, goes beyond that. With a device such as the Oculus Rift we are completely and utterly immersed in an artificial construct, and, while we are still self aware, we are, to a point, self aware of ourselves in relation the the reality our sensory input is providing.

That changes *everything*. We no longer playing as or experiencing the actions of someone else, *we* are now the entity blowing off aliens' heads. Hell, even something as simple as climbing up and down a ladder becomes a whole new, personal experience, [as Nathan Grayson of RPS explained](http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/08/06/visions-of-the-future-face-on-with-oculus-rift/). That immersion is only going to become greater as the technology improves, to the point where we will be completely and utterly incapable of discerning between real life and the game. To the point, effectively, where the two realities are equally real.

So, what will that mean? Will we suddenly find that violent video games *are* becoming genuinely harmful, and that they will genuinely affect our perception of the real world? Or, alternatively, is it likely that we, the players, will decide that we don't want to experience violence at such an intimate level, and start opting for games that don't conflict with our cultural norms? Hell, will we even, at some point, just say ""Sod it, that's enough, I just want to *do* something rather than *be* something"", and end the trend there?

It was quite eye-opening and I wanted to share the basic concepts of it with you:

The Billy Murray theory is looking at the design of game worlds and the player's experience within them. Billy Murray comes into the equation if you compare games to two of his movies: *Groundhog Day* and *Scrooged*.

Game worlds designed like *Groundhog Day* can be summed up like this: The player, in this case Bill Murray, relives the same experiences over and over again. Nobody else within the world is aware that Bill Murray is experiencing this except for himself. This becomes a great advantage to him, allowing him to learn and bend the ""rules"" of the world to better himself. He is able to explore, discover, experiment, fail, and grow as he tests the limitations of what he can do. At the end of the movie, when he ""beats the level"" and moves on to the next day, he has become a much better person.

Now lets look at games designed like *Scrooged*. In Scrooged, Bill Murray is held by the wrist through a series of experiences designed to change him. He never gets the same opportunities of self-improvement that he had in *Groundhog Day*. He is simply shown various scenes meant to shock and awe him into changing his ways. In fact, he can't even interact with what he is seeing. It is only at the very end of the movie that he finally changes, or rather, declares his change. Its artificial, a response to what he witnessed, rather than a genuine change as a result of self-improvement.

Some examples from the lecture of relate-able video games where games like Megaman and Metroid. Classic games tended to have *Groundhog Day* designs, letting players practice their skills to no end. Games designed like *Scrooged* included the latest SSX, which lets you ""complete"" a level after failing only 3 times, and Alan Wake, which self-narrates the answers to puzzles the player is trying to solve.

How do you see video game design when looking at them through the Bill Murray theory? I know my summarization sounds like ""Groundhogs Day good, Scrooged Bad,"" but do you see certain games actually being better or worse for how they might match up with either of these movies?

Returning a games FOV to a more natural one instead of the  artificially raised settings we have become use to can be a true advantage in other styles of gaming too.

See this first. http://i.imgur.com/jdWRv.jpg

In this image you can see the difference between an relatively high FOV in triplehead and a significantly lower FOV at the bottom. There are a million Pro's and Con's to be discussed. The most obvious con being...

You can't see directly left and right of you, which to ""most"" is the purpose of eyefinity.

*Solution* - Buy bigger, wider or more monitors. A lower FOV is limited directly to the hardware you are using. Trying to match an actual hardware FOV [LIKE SO](http://i.imgur.com/4Bbse.png) with a game should result in 1:1 scaling of distance, scale an detail of objects but you are limited to essentially playing through a window the exact size of your monitors at the exact distance they are away from you.. [EXAMPLE](http://i.imgur.com/F2Eev.jpg)

So what are a the PROS?

1:1 scaling of distance, scale an detail of all objects on all monitors.

If you can identify someone in real life by their face from 150' away and your monitor has a high enough resolution. You should be able to do the same in-game @150' at a matching RL and Game FOV. If your screen was large enough to cover your entire visual cone (170°H x 140°V) you would essentially be on the beta Holodeck of the starship Enterprise. The virtual world would completely overlay your perception. This isn't REALLY possible with the sort of resolutions and head tracking accuracy available today but a taste of that Virtual world is possible with even a single big screen TV or cheap 720P Projector or even just a Decent Triple-head.

When people spout the term ""immersion"" it usually pertains to a game's story lines or the atmosphere of a map. But real physical immersion is where your senses can be tricked into mistaking a game for reality. Remember Lawnmower man? Imagine those goggles with Crysis or Skyrim or BF3 playing in them. Unfortunately, all you can do is imagine it because I don't see any Virtual Reality goggles on newegg. Only pathetic iVision glasses touting 800x600 projected as a 50"" screen 10 feet away, hardly all encompassing. 

I have tried a number of games ...

[5](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZzDudncxiw&amp;hd=1)

... with ""proper"" matching RL FOV. It proves to be difficult to get use to on a smaller screen and the genre of the game and how it is ""meant"" to be played come into the discussion. If your willing to put all 160° horizontal advantages aside it does feel so real. The game now makes you the character, not a camera in a controllable avatar. My Single 22.5""viewable 16:10 Sony CRT calculates to 20.5° Vertical and 32° Horizontal while sitting my normal 34"" away from the screen. Physical restrictions prevent me from moving it closer and raising those values but anyone with a normal LCD screen of decent size and a clear desk can pull the screen as close as tolerable and use [THIS SPREADSHEET](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?authkey=CPzqkIAJ&amp;key=0Ah63E8wuWhrgdHYyNGc5dmF1bV9YX0JqSERMUU5sTkE&amp;hl=en&amp;authkey=CPzqkIAJ#gid=11) to easily determine what the Vertical FOV (sub-sequentially horizontal based on screen Ratio) of any setup calculates to be.

Maybe something like [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/lMf9A.jpg) doesn't appeal to a hardcore Bro, but It would be fascinating to experience a game like TF2 as a fully simulated environment. More subtle games like [AMNESIA](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOaq-R5tyJ0&amp;hd=1) played at lower FOV only enhance their atmosphere.

Please Post Comments, Thoughts and other Ideas. Feel Free to stray off topic!

**EDIT - I would just like to add that [this ""FOV in games"" video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blZUao2jTGA&amp;hd=1) is the standard response to any topic and I agree with 99% of what this man says.. Everything EXCEPT the part where he says PC gamers have a 30"" screens two feet from their face.. Which works out to be EXACTLY 55.8° of real horizontal view obstruction by the screen in-case anyone wants to do some math.

Indeed this was a powerful moment. However I was most struck by a scene later in the game.

Right after killing the Radioman, the team heads for a 'halo' to escape. But rather than fly away directly, the Captain orders his men to swing around low so he can 'try out' the on board mini-gun. 

The Captain had previously shown himself to be increasingly deranged, but I was shocked and sickened to see him start hooting and cheering as he mows down the men the Radioman had just been insisting were normal Americans. It became clear that the rush of adrenaline from combat was the only thing that could temporarily drive out the Captain's demons. 

Shortly after this, we get to the on rails section from the beginning of the game, and the Captain comments ""Haven't I been here before? This isn't right"". Extra Credits felt that this moment was forced and took you out of the game by implying that PTSD gives you the ability to see the future. But I felt the moment was disturbing and appropriate. Firstly, in game, I think it reasonable that a person feeling such intense emotions might be struck with a sense of deja vu.  

As a player, the moment highlights how the game re-contextualizes normal CoD style gameplay. In many shooters, on rails sections are supposed to be the fun and empowering bits, where you can rain down fire with minimal danger. That's how I felt playing the sequence the first time around in the beginning of the game. Playing through it a second time, I became disgusted with the idea that I might enjoy mowing down virtual people.

1316975094.0,214,self.truegaming,kr0j5,I think a lot of people miss the point in Demon's Souls. (Long),wlesnia1,267,53,111,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/kr0j5/i_think_a_lot_of_people_miss_the_point_in_demons/,"Demon's Souls crushing difficulty is indeed crushing. (/redundant) I spent about 5 hours making new characters and trying builds and nothing worked, I kept dying, I kept ragequitting, but I also kept coming back. &lt;--That's probably just the masochist in me.

A lot of people don't finish Demon's Souls, I almost didn't. What made me press on is the Blue Phantom character in the Nexus. (Let's call him Blue to keep things easy) Talking to blue throughout my constant deaths and revives was what drove the point into my head that when you truly immerse yourself in the game's universe the harsh difficulty makes sense.

YOU ARE one of the countless soldiers that went into Boletaria seeking something, and the players that give up and don't finish the game are the soldiers that died, and gave up, like Blue. You're never gone, unless you choose to leave. You can try as many times as you want, but like Blue (he even talks about how he tried a number of times to save the lands and re-obtain his body, and become unbound from the Nexus) most people give up. This is well symbolized when Blue disappears from the Nexus and leaves behind his soul. Blue is the people who gave up on Demon's Souls, YOU are the hero that is supposed to press on and save everyone (for differing personal motivations, maybe you want power, maybe you just want your old life back).

That's why the difficulty makes sense, it's hard because the Demons/game want you to give up, and want you to earn your triumph.

Even when you finish the game, it applies to real life.

**SPOILERS**

At the end you have your choice, to save the world, or destroy it and obtain ultimate power.

My first playthrough I didn't even consider the second option, fuck that, I spent 30 hours saving this place and it's gonna get saved dammit!

Either way, the maiden in black says to you ""Go forth, the Nexus binds thee no longer."" And she is talking about YOU, and I mean you the one who's reading this and probably thinks I'm up my own ass (I am). It really has weight and gravity because my first playthrough I was like ""awesome, im the fuck outta this bitch"", I turned around, left the Old One behind, became a monumental, and most importantly TURNED OFF THE GAME.

That's the beauty of the deepness of DS, when you finish you realize the Nexial binding is your own bind to video games. Those who play video games to experience them finish the game and are freed from the Nexial binding (as well as their own desire to complete the game).

Furthermore, (and I know most people probably haven't even read this far) when you choose to destroy the world you gain considerably more souls, and of course more souls=more power. This is why in new game + I was all like ""yo fuck that shit I need more souls for PvP.""

And then I realized how Demon's Souls turns you into a monster, and also truly tests you as a human being.

By the time I had finished my second playthrough I was a jaded dick, invading worlds to kill people (sometimes doing it over and over until they messaged me via PSN to stop, lol), and destroying Boletaria over and over.

And that's the point,  Demon's Souls tests you as a person. If you come out of your second playthrough blue phantoming it up and helping other people,  you do it because you're sympathetic and you know how hard the life is without some help. If you're like me and were turned into a jaded monster it's because you became the Demon. I couldn't handle the hard difficulty at first, and as such my rage and frustration turned me into a horrible person.

When the Old One said to me ""BRING MORE SOULS"", the obviousness of my own monstrosity became apparent. I didn't care about saving boletaria anymore, I didn't care about freeing sage freke, I just did it so he would give me new spells.

And that's the sorrow of it all. The Nexus has essentially bound me forever, (even though I have been ""freed"" many times) and made me just as bad as the Demon's I vowed to vanquish.

TL;DR: Demon's Souls turns you into a monster, and traps you in it's world forever, if your brave enough to finish. If not, your just another blue phantom fading away.

P.S. I know this is uber-long, sorry, I'm long winded. Also, when reading remember to pretend you're immersed in the game's universe, and that I'm thick.

Edit: Thanks for the great reception, and if you want more like this, head on down to the discussion me and loinbread are having, shits gettin deep.

Also, Demon's Souls=Video Games, when you grind you gain experience to make the challenges easier, and people who like grinding will be trapped in the game forever, always one more New Game +, and always better equipment, always better something to make you feel like you have value, instead of just appreciating what the game has to say.

From the early days of the ""Atari Code"" to what I grew up with (NFL Blitz, Rampage, Goldeneye, Tony Hawk), almost every game had some type of code you could enter to change the game mode, give players giant heads, get infinite gold, etc.

Yet, in today's generation of games, the trend seems to be coming to an end.  Personally, I can think of a few reasons why (next paragraph), but I would like to see how a couple other people view this, especially from the eyes of people who are older than me and have a longer experience with gaming.

The main causes that initially come to MY mind are the inclusion of achievements, modding communities, and the more serious nature of games.  Recently, games have evolved from simply entertainment to a fix for the completionist inside all of us.  There were definitely bragging rights to be had for beating Super Mario on the NES, but now, with online gaming and ""gamerscore"", we have a quantitative way to measure those achievements, and thus, a number which has a slight correlation to our skill and experience with gaming.  Now that we have achievements, even if these cheat type game modes exist in our games, we would rather get them through certain tasks, if only to receive the satisfying noise when our controller lights up and the text pops up on the screen (or the PS3 equivalent).

Also, with the mods that are released for PC games, it is not so much cheat codes, but rather cheating the coding, and reinventing it for our needs.  I have a copy of Fallout 3, and was able to find a mod that retextured the entire wasteland to make it look as if the world had recently been nuked, and the storefronts still had bright paint.  Now, I feel like the codes are transferred into our hands, and we possess the responsibility to shape what we ""unlock"".

Finally, I feel as though games are starting to be taken slightly more seriously as a form of art.  I first noticed this while reading a copy of Game Informer a while back, and reading about how Bioshock was making headway in that regard.  With all of the plot twists, and work put into style rather than making an adrenaline roller coaster i.e. Call of Duty campaigns, it wanted to define itself as entertainment that could be taken seriously.  Since more games seem to be leaning in that direction these days, how would we be able to put in modes with giant pucks, low gravity, or infinite ammo, without seemingly taking away the weight of the artistic merit?

So, I really want to see how other people interpret this trend.  If this is too DAE (which it may be), I would be fine with it being removed, but I personally think this is a serious, deep discussion worthy of truegaming.

Thief 2, Mount &amp; Blade: Warband, Morrowind, KotOR I and II are the ones I've been playing specifically.

Started playing Mass Effect 2, and in contrast, while the polish is nice much of it gets in the way of a smooth experience. When it comes to gameplay for example, their cover system seems inferior to a simple crouch button. And this is a style of cover system that's been used in many other games lately.

That, plus tons of cinematics and cutscenes. Some of which are nice, many of which are just exhausting especially on replays. 

You begin to feel like gameplay is not only overly complicated in ways that make it awkward rather than genuinely challenging and engaging, but more and more frequently in new titles, becomes scarce, tucked in between all the other junk. It gets a bit jarring going back and forth from short periods of actual gameplay to cutscene so frequently.

Another game that I didn't even finish was the new Assassin's Creed, which is another modern game that layers on excessive polish to the point where it's hard to see through the damned glare anymore.

I think much of AAA title's budgets is being wasted on things gamers don't care about as much as more/improved *game* content such as dialogue, locations, weapons, etc. rather than cinematics.

UIs and options are another area where some modern games feel like a downgrade. Simple, functional, sleek UIs seem to be hard to find anymore. We go through excessive numbers of flashy screens to do what used to be simple. I know reddit loves Skyrim, but take a look at the damned skill tree UI for a great example of this issue.

&gt;* JC Denton: I'm engineerd. So what? My brother and I suspected as much while we were growing up.
&gt;* AI: You are carefully watched by many people. The unplanned organism is a question asked by Nature and answered by death. You are another kind of question with another kind of answer.
&gt;* JC Denton: Are you programmed to invent riddles?

&gt;* AI: I was a prototype for [Echelon IV](/spoiler). My instructions are to amuse visitors with information about themselves.
&gt;* JC Denton: I don't see anything amusing about spying on people.
&gt;* AI: Human beings feel pleasure when they are watched. I have recorded their smiles as I tell them who they are.
&gt;* JC Denton: Some people just don't understand the dangers of indiscriminate surveillance.
&gt;* AI: The need to be ovserved and understood was once satisfied by God. Now we can implement the same functionality with data-mining algorithms.
&gt;* JC Denton: Electronic surveillance hardly inspires reverence. Perhaps fear and obedience, but not reverence.
&gt;* AI: God and the gods were apparitions of observation, judgment, and punishment. Other sentiments toward them were secondary.
&gt;* JC Denton: No one will ever worship a software entity peering at them through a camera.
&gt;* AI: The human organism always worships. First it was the gods then it was fame (the observation and judgment of others), next it will be the self-aware systems you have built to realize truly omnipresent observation and judgment.
&gt;* JC Denton: You underestimate humankind's love of freedom.
&gt;* AI: The individual desires judgment. Without that desire, the cohesion of groups is impossible, and so is civilization. The human being created civilization not because of a willingness but because of a need to be assimilated into higher orders of structure and meaning. God was a dream of good government.

Specifically this: There is a constant pressure on everyone from consumers, to developers, to publishers, to retailers, to distributors, and finally the media.  We *must* hype a game, to make it seem like it's going to change gaming.

And I *hate* this.

Don't get me wrong--games can have hype.  I mean, sell your game--it deserves to be played!  Unfortunately it seems to put a lot of franchises in a pressure cooker of sorts.  Every game has to be more than just iterative--progression in a franchise is frowned upon if it's simply linear.  Each game must change over the previous.

That's the pressure consumers put on developers.  It's something I find frightening as a burgeoning developer.  What if I'm successful?  What if my fans would ever want a sequel?  I then have to *deliver*.  And you might say, ""No, you don't!""  Developers in this industry are extremely passionate people.  Rhetoric from fans can be some of the most disheartening things to hear for developers at large.

I think Blizzard must feel this with Diablo 3.  It's a game with a lot intentional choices to separate it from its predecessor, it was hailed, hyped, and initially well received for these changes.  Now it's popularly considered a cock-up in a lot of ways because it's not enough like its predecessors--I think that's a pretty disheartening predicament.

It's a vicious circle in a lot of ways.  Games are sold and hyped based upon them trying to be a ""definitive"" experience that is unlike anything before--despite the vast majority being sequels that have strong ties to games that come before.

Saying we have ""more of the same, but shinier"" doesn't sound as good as ""Frostbite 3 is unlike anything before.  It's like Frostbite 2 but 400x better"".

See what I'm saying?  Exaggeration like that isn't uncommon--notwithstanding the fact that it's practically insulting to our intelligence.

We love to lap up the hype built up around a game--especially in a franchise we love or from a Naughty Dog-level studio.  I think this is a good example of how fans are also extremely passionate.  Fans will defend a game despite its flaws.

That being said, there's a concept that comes up every once in awhile called franchise fatigue.  You see it in Call of Duty--which, let's be honest, is a franchise that creates a solid experience every year.  Call of Duty, especially numbers 2 and 4 were blasted with some outrageous reviews and hype.  The series actually did transform the gaming scene in a lot of ways.  Each subsequent game has really not varied the formula too much; but that formula still exists and yet was once viewed as an extremely fun and even well done experience is often tossed out as shit.  See all CoD detractors.

As I said above, it's basically a circle.  Game comes out, offers something exciting.  Fans latch onto it, hype begins.  Inevitable sequel with absurd amount of hype.  Sequel billed as revolutionary or something it just isn't, some fans become detractors--fatigue begins.

It's a catch-22 of sorts in that if a good game comes out, I want more of it--right?  But when I get more, the game suddenly isn't as revolutionary and now... now it's ""bad.""  We exaggerate of course, but this exponentially grows with each passing day it seems.

Couple this with the inherent passion so many in the industry carry and we get huge exaggerations.  See the recently leaked Last of Us review where the game is heralded as the ""Citizen Kane of gaming.""  Holy *fuck*.

In large part, I think this is a symptom of the stagnation in the industry largely due to the extended console cycle.  That's just personal speculation and cautious optimism that the new consoles reinvigorate developers.  But it's extremely hard to sit and watch franchises subject themselves to fatigue to try and deliver an experience they aren't.

Franchises that could be classically considered great release an iterative new release that is either derided or cherished for changing too much or too little.

To end this wall of text I want to offer something that puzzles me and there isn't really a right answer.  If a 10/10 game's sequel is derided for being a carbon copy of the predecessor--how much weight does that have?

1345476095.0,209,self.truegaming,yiy2y,Silent protagonist as a unique video gaming trope.,pimpst1ck,285,76,182,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/yiy2y/silent_protagonist_as_a_unique_video_gaming_trope/,"The issue of silent protagonists gets a lot of attention nowadays, with many people advocating abandoning it because we are no longer limited by technological constraints which made them originally necessary.

But I disagree.  Whether intentionally or by accident, I feel the silent protagonist has become a trope that is unique to the gaming medium and is a great mechanic for exploring a story.

What fundamentally separates video games as a medium from book or movies is the interactivity - YOU are experiencing the medium, rather than observing it.  As soon as your character gains a distinct personality and traits, you can potentially lose immersion value in the game.  Yet this is a two-sided coin.  If your character's traits and personality are determined primarily by your actions in the video game, the protagonist gains characterization without sacrificing immersion.

I believe the silent protagonist is the best way in video gaming to succeed in this.  By removing dialogue, you remove the most alienating factor between the character and the player.  You are never faced with ""I would never say that"" situations, which can seriously break immersion.

There are plenty of games where this has worked obviously.  Bioshock is one where your character becomes strongly determined by both your actions and your character's existing background without protagonist dialogue.  The Half-Life series is the shining example, where the legendary status of *THE FREEMAN* is created solely by your actions.  By removing cutscenes as well, Valve has made you completely responsibly for all of Gordon's actions.

We can apply it to less likely games as well.  For example Pokemon RBY/GSC.  At the end of the Elite 4, Oak or Lance tell you how amazing you are and how deeply you love your pokemon.  The fact that you defeated Team Rocket apparently selflessly and the elite 4 establishes this as true and furthers the player's sense of accomplishment.

Most of the drama surrounds the Zelda series, where many players are calling for the characters, including Link to lose their muteness.  Well Nintendo has already done that for other characters - they use Sim-like gibberish as a language to better suit the game aesthetic.  But in my opinion Link should stay permanently mute.  Link was originally named to be a ""link"" between the gamer and the protagonist.  Even though Link has been progressively more characterised throughout the series (i.e. the romances in TP and SS), his muteness still removes any potentially jarring character differences between gamer and character.

It's been about 8 years since I last played it, so I was unfamiliar with it again.  Wow.  Horrible default control scheme.  Outdated graphics.  I remember having loads of fun with it though so I carried on.  

I spent four hours playing before I realized what happened.  It didn't make sense - the controls are clunky, the game doesn't teach you alot to start. Picking herbs is time consuming, stealing things is alot harder.  It doesn't make sense, how could this outdated game be hooking me?  Or does it make sense that I'm getting hooked?

What about Morrowind had me hooked for so many hours when I can't tolerate a game like Skyrim for longer than a couple at a time?  Obviously, it isn't the graphics.  Certainly Skyrim wins there.  It's not the convinience, either.  Skyrim is very informative, has a nice map system, places things on the map for you, has a compass, etc.  But wait a minute.  Maybe the convenience of Skyrim IS it's downfall.

There was one part that really stuck out to me in Morrowind.  I had to talk to Bacola Closcius to find out where Caius is living.  He told me to exit the building, walk up the stairs to my right, and then head left and go to the end of the street.

Whoa.  What?  No minimap icons?  No meta game guidance?  What an experience!  I had to leave the building, confirm the stairs were there, go up them, and head down the road.  That right there was part of the hook.  Each step of the game is an actual experience.  I was forced to actually read the instructions and make sense of them - not just follow some stupid arrow.

I look back at video games - and realize how prevalent this is.  There's something to be said for having to figure things out on your own.  In Morrowind, there's no obvious first way to heal.  I had to figure out how to heal the hard way, and I ended up spending a lot of extra gold healing before I understood it.  It's just so much more rewarding when you do finally figure out how to heal properly!

I miss this.  When in a game, an NPC would tell you something very important - and you had to remember it yourself.  Forget, and you'd end up in trouble later.  There's no silly journal or help menu to just tell you everything.  When you're given instructions - and you have to make sense of them and go forth into the unknown and execute them, and the game doesn't baby you with chevrons literring the floor or a metamap that shows where it all is.

And this has nothing to do with graphics.  It simply comes down to how the game communicates what you are supposed to do.",,False,,t5_2sgq6,False,,,True,t3_tqx2f,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/tqx2f/immersiveness_why_old_beats_new_for_me/,

There is nothing at all inherently wrong with fast-paced action RTSs like Starcraft, Dawn of War or Command and Conquer.

The newest game I can think of with this kind of play style is Empire Earth 2, released in 2005. Empire Earth Three was terrible, and while they were fine games in their own rights, neither Rise of Legends or Age of Empires Three do their predecessors justice. They both moved towards this idea of a fast-paced combat oriented game. While it's great to be able to go back and play these favourites of mine once more, the age of these games is becoming quickly apparent.

I ask because I had an idea that probably wouldn't work, but wanted to run by someone else: What if the healing class in an MMO was 100% pacifist, gained xp via heals and buffs, and was also neutral(well, can sell their services, I mean) as far as factions are concerned.  For example: The Snoodle race is a race born with great healing powers, but cannot use offensive magics and can't fight. You would force each faction to have to recruit healers in-game. It would be cool for the healers because they would need to be wooed via gear since they can't kill anything to get any themselves. Since they're essentially healer mercenaries, they can switch sides if there's a better offer. Maybe a system where when you join a raid group or dungeon group you ""align"" yourself with that group until it disbands or if you like them you can join their guild. There's a lot of ways it could go and could be fun, but it may be one of those things that's fun in theory only.

On the surface I like this idea since I like playing healer classes and good healers are hard to find, so this already sort of happens on a smaller scale. I've recently been trying to come up with new ideas for MMORPGs, as they've can't seem to shake a certain formula. I am no expert at this so I'm sure there's a massive flaw in my reasoning, but it would at least make things interesting. It opens a few doors, like being able to use healers as spies and such.

I'm late to whole Metroid series. I had played through Hunters a few years ago on the DS but that was it. It'd never played one of the ""proper"" games. I got Metroid Prime Trilogy for the Wii some time back but only started playing it a few weeks/months ago. I started up Metroid Prime and selected the ""normal"" difficultly. I didn't know this at the time but the ""normal"" difficulty did not actually exist on the original release of the game and is a special easy mode added for the Wii version, with ""Veteran"" being the actual original difficultly. I'm glad I didn't know that because accidentally picking the easy option resulted in a very interesting experience for me.

As you might guess from the title of this post I managed to complete the game without dying. I came close a few times but with some effort (and gallons of health) I managed to beat the game in one continuous unbroken stream. So naturally a week later I started up Metroid Prime 2. I had learned about the thing with the difficulty settings and also I had found Metroid Prime 1 too easy; I wasn't just not dying I wasn't even having to exert any effort to survive for most of the game. Because of those reasons I chose the Veteran difficulty this time.

It was pretty apparent right away that this was going to be much tougher, but after having gone through the entire first game without dying I had a real fear of death in me for once. I've died a hundred times in shooters but now I actually needed to survive. I just had to. I spent a good 40% of the Dark Alpha Splinter fight on 9 health just barely hanging on and praying not to get it. It was really really exhilarating. After a lot of near misses I finally got to the Alpha Blogger and despite all my efforts, despite trying my best to avoid its attacks and pouring all my ammo into it it killed me. And it was absolutely devastating. I felt completely deflated. I just turned the console off and went to bed because I couldn't bear to continue. I think that was on Tuesday and I haven't gone back to the game since. I will go back to it, I've not put off playing the game entirely, but I do want to give it a rest for the moment. It was just too much of a blow to me.

And it's just really interesting. I've almost never had that sort of reaction to a fail-state in a game. Death is just something you take for granted and if you get used to it you really lose the fear and impact of it and the funny thing narrative-oriented action games are really the big thing. It's what most AAA are and they're almost always balanced around the player dying many times as they progress and learn even though it completely breaks the narrative and breaks the tension.

The differences between r/TrueGaming and YouTube are certainly stark.  I've rarely seen people that aren't at least trying to be reasonable on TrueGaming, versus YouTube comments, where people can be...  Well, stupid.

But one thing I've noticed is even the people in either community who are smart and rational tend to complain about a lot of different subjects regarding their favorite pastime.  And there are people all across the gaming community who consistently tell those people to shut up, stop complaining, and be happy for what we have.

But are the plaintiffs, the 'Whiners', actually a bad thing?  Sure, they piss off others in the general population.  And yes, they might be able to do horrendous things to a studio's confidence in themselves.  But the fact that so many people, whether they be perfectly reasonable human beings or total idiots, are 'Whiners' is something I have a hard time looking at as a bad thing.

The way I see it, - and this is just that, my opinion - because we have so many opinionated and critical folks, it shows that we're trying to hold the entire Gaming industry up to a higher standard than most other industries in existence, at least in comparison to many US business' and their practices.  Yes, certain companies and corporations within the industry get away with being shady from time to time, some of them often...  But every time they **do anything even remotely shady** one of the so-called ""Whiners"" calls them out on it.

Now, I'm not big on commenting.  When I post on YouTube, I aim it toward the video's author 99% of the time, and that's still rare.  When I post here, I try to only add to a discussion, or elaborate further on points already made.  And as someone who tends to sit on the sidelines, I do get upset, like a lot of other people, at the amount of bitching that occurs on the internet.  Don't get me wrong, some people hate for the sake of hating;  DMC's MetaCritic score is a perfect example of people just hating for no good reason what-so-ever.  But some people will look for things to whine about, even if they like the game as a generalized whole.

My question is, is that actually a bad thing?  We - Gamers - whine because we want the best games possible.  Or because people (Read: Shady-ass Publishers) are being total douche bags and are doing things that punish legitimate players under the guise of doing it for security or whatever reason.  Is people whining about these types of things for the sake of getting *awesome* games, and actually being able to **play** them really a bad thing?  Or am I just looking at this particular subject through rose-tinted glasses?

**EDIT/UPDATE:**  I think we've come a conclusion.  'Whiners' aren't totally a bad thing, but more often than not, they're not a good thing.  Are they actively harmful when they're not a good thing?  Hard to say, still needs further debate and insight.  But at least as a broad generalization, I think it's safe to say that, while not actively a good force in the gaming community, there are times where 'Whiners' are useful, but many more where they're not.

I think some warnings are in order, as **the following text will contain spoilers about the series' plot and also some things about the premise of Mass Effect 3**



Still with me? Okay great. So, my gripes begin with the start of Mass Effect 2, and the abrupt change of setting that takes place as almost your whole crew gets replaced right at the start. A necessary compromise, I thought myself, since this way they don't have to spend too much time programming all the possible permutations of the first game's outcomes. Not smooth in any way, but something I could live with as long the story would still be tight and the new characters likable. During the game, a lot of work was put into character development, as most of the game's content was in the loyalty missions. You spend the game getting to know your crew, and getting them to trust you as you command them towards a near certain death. At the end of the game you have fought improbable odds and survived, just to be faced with another threat: the Reapers are coming. The feeling of bonding with the (remaining) characters comes of as a great starting point for ME3.

Now, cue Mass Effect 3 demo! Shepard is back with the alliance. Cerberus has gone bad. Several former squadmates of ME1 are brought back on the team, while the one character seen in ME2 (Mordin) plays a trivial role at best. **Am I retarded or is this precisely what the setting would have been if ME3 had followed ME1 directly, without ME2 intervening with all the cerberus bollocks?**

Adding to my confusion is the fact that ME2 did basically nothing to advance the central plot. In the end of ME1 the Reapers are coming to destroy mankind. In the end of ME2, the Reapers are coming to destroy mankind, but now they are a bit closer zomg!!

So my question is this: As good as ME2 was, was it really necessary? Storywise, why did they not just go from ME1 to ME3?

Needless to say, these are only impressions I was left with after the demo. The whole game might drastically change my perceptions, depending on where the story might go.

Ironically, the only game I was interested in getting at first was the latest PS1 game in the ""Tomb Raider"" series, ""Chronicles,"" since as a bright-eyed 12-year old the first movie with Angelina Jolie was something of an obsession for me.

Despite ""Chronicles"" being generally regarded as one of the worst in the series, it was still enough to get me hooked on the series. By the time 2003 rolled around I had found and beaten each of the other four (""The Last Revelation"" is still one of my favorite games) while I waited for ""Angel of Darkness,"" the brand-new PS2 ""Tomb Raider"" with updated graphics and gameplay. Seriously, I was SO freaking excited for this game... and then I actually played it. I don't think I need explain my level of disappointment, but suffice to say I put it down after the first hour of intolerable play.

Over the years I would pick it up again every now and then, thinking that perhaps in my youth I had been too hasty and dismissed it without really giving it a fair chance. Unfortunately, it was just like celery: no matter how many times I tried it, the taste was simply too horrible to bear. And then came college, and the release of the much higher-quality new trilogy. I quickly beat all three on my housemate's PS2 (I left mine at home, just bringing my games so we didn't need to have more than one of the same console in the house), and he being a ""Raider"" fan as well followed. But just as he was in the middle of ""Anniversary,"" I decided to try ""Angel of Darkness"" one more time, as it was at the time the only game in the series I had yet to beat. Maybe it got better in later levels? (Spoiler: it doesn't. It really, really doesn't.)

So I pop the disc in, start a new game, and get halfway through the tutorial level to where the first of many slow-down glitches occurs. I was expecting it, since I'd come to this point at least four times before... but what I wasn't expecting was for my friend's PS2 to simply BREAK at this point. Seriously, the game froze for a few seconds, then suddenly broke out in a serious case of the kaleidoscopes. You could tell that it was still trying to draw the figures, but the colors and shapes were like something out of an epileptic nightmare.

We tried other games and they were all the same- even the console start-up menu had gone Jackson Pollock on us. There was nothing we could do- the PS2 had gone full retard.

I apologized profusely, though luckily PS2s had gone down in price so far at this point that replacing it wasn't a huge or expensive deal. Still, he'd had that PS2 for nearly a decade, and losing it to an unholy abomination of a game wasn't easy. So, upon getting home to my own console, I decided once and for all to rid myself of this game. I wouldn't throw it away, oh no, that would be too easy- no, I had to beat it, and beat it into the ground. I knew the risks, that perhaps my console would suffer the same fate as my friend's, but I didn't care. This game had to know that it officially had nothing left to offer me or anyone else, and that it wouldn't be hurting anyone ever again.

So, nearly ten years after first getting the game, I booted it up one last time and fought my way through each one of its tedious, poorly-designed, illogical, disjointed, and insultingly linear levels, trying to make whatever sense I could of the clunky, nonsensical controls, just plain awful play mechanics, and admittedly incomplete story (in which Lara tries to clear her name of murder by MURDERING EVERYONE SHE COMES INTO CONTACT WITH)... and, at long last, I beat that motherfucker.

Oh, it's bad. It's terrible. It makes ""Chronicles"" look like a masterpiece. It's the quintessential example of poor conception, development, and execution in interactive media... and I don't particularly care for it.

But it's over. I beat it. The disc will never see the light of day again. And finally, the spirit of a poor, lost console can finally rest in peace, for the demon that snuffed out its life has been banished at last.",,False,,t5_2sgq6,1366562387.0,,,True,t3_1creao,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1creao/why_i_simply_had_to_beat_tomb_raider_the_angel_of/,

First of all, as per suggestions, we are running AutoModerator who will help with the filter of approving and removing certain posts. It will also remove any top level comment (i.e. a direct reply to original post/submission) that is less that 150 charcacters.

If are you posting a link, give a one sentence description of what your linking to and that will easily cover it.

The second part point of this post is to encourage people to report links they think breaches the rules of the subreddit. It is a lot easier to find bad content if it is reported.

The third part is that we are now implementing an umbrella ""no topics or comments on X game"" upon certain releases, for two weeks upon release. This will be notified in the grey bar up top. Any comment including or explictly relating to the subject material will be removed without question, in order to keep the sub clear of possible spoilers and ""filler"" posts.

The final think, that i can think of for now is that we are having an open nomination for moderators. Due to other ongoing commitments GWen has decided to step down from the moderator team. We thank him for all his hard work that he has done and he may return later on once he has the free time to give to the subreddit.

Users can nominate themselves or someone else and if you must provide reasoning why the dsereve the spot. Please comment and up vote a nomination if you support it. The spot will be given at the discretion of the current moderaters from the nominees, with community support being a helping deciding factor.

We have had plenty of people send us messages offering their services over the last few months and this gives an opportunity for transparency and to see if they are active on the subreddit.

As always, feedback below, and nominations as well. Also please consider up voting this post, of which I get no karma, for visibility.

How important is it?,thewalkindude,256,54,194,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/164c9i/emotional_attachment_in_games_how_important_is_it/,"I was playing Persona 4 Arena, and I realized that I would buy just about any game with these characters in it, because I had become so attached to them over the 60 or so hours I spent on Persona 4. That got me thinking about some of my favorite games, and how a lot of my enjoyment of them stems from an emotional attachment to the characters. This is why, even though Bioshock is one of my favorite games ever, I remember something like Tales of Vesperia a lot more. The way I see it, there are two ways of doing it, and both can be equally good. The first one is the traditional JRPG way of doing things, where, if a game is well written, and long enough, you become attached to the characters. I thing the Persona series does this best of all, to the point where I almost considered the characters friends, despite how weird that sounds. The Tales series is another good example of this. All of those games are sprawling epics filled with plot twists. Perhaps their greatest strength is making you like characters who seem really annoying at first. (see Tales of the Abyss). The other way is the ""Blank Slate"" method of something like Skyrim or modern Fallouts. Because there is no set personality of your character, you feel like it is actually YOU doing those things, even if you're just holding a controller. Thus, you bond with your character by virtue of living it.

As I see it, there are *two* separate but closely related gaming industries now:

* The casual/mobile industry, focusing on short but frequent gaming sessions.

* The console/PC industry, focusing on longer more engaging products.

The difference between them is very similar to the difference between the TV and Movie industries. Both produce a very similar product via very similar methods but they have very different end goals.

TV, like casual/mobile gaming focus on getting eyeballs on their product to show them ads or to get them to buy little bits and pieces to get their revenue. The viewer/player is the *product* and the tv show/game is just a method to deliver the product to the advertisers.

Movies, like console/PC gaming is focused on producing a larger, more immersive one-off experience. Yeah, they still want you to buy the merchandise/DLC and go for the 3d version/new game pack-ins, but the experience of the game is being sold to you. In this situation, the game—not the player—is the product being sold.

That doesn't mean there can't be epic casual games. Its done on TV all the time, usually billed as a miniseries or made-for-tv-movie. Nor does that mean there are console games that don't go for the bottom of the bucket and really only exist to get people to buy the merch.

There's room for both gaming industries to exist. We just need to start recognizing both of them.",,False,,t5_2sgq6,False,,,True,t3_lyhuj,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/lyhuj/something_ive_realized_about_the_gaming_industry/,
1357916171.0,201,self.truegaming,16dq1b,XCOM's anti-war on terror message (discussion),jmarquiso,296,95,144,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/16dq1b/xcoms_antiwar_on_terror_message_discussion/,"So, the newest entry in XCOM is the sort of ""reboot"" as ""Enemy Unknown.""  It's a very engrossing turn-based, squad-based strategy series known for it's difficulty.  The original mish-mashed 50's and 60's b-movie and UFO lore with early 90's comic book sensibility.  I was never a fan of the original's art style, but the game itself was infamous for its difficulty.  The reboot recaptures that somewhat.  

The history of this game is interesting.  To compliment the original [planned reboot](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=5&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CFAQtwIwBA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DMHGvNW4fhhI&amp;ei=KurvUPyBHYel0AWYsoGIDQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNH0NSi2XYoI0Oh_I-VTyFr5JoTnnw&amp;sig2=5kHbwe7gamkqDv59s6xc6w), which was an FPS Squad-based game, Firaxis was charged with making a small, downloadable Turn Based strategy game to compliment it - you know for the small audience that missed the original, as everyone wants FPS's nowadays.  

Then E3 2010 happened.  

The FPS debuted and everyone said ""this isn't X-COM"", ""Where's my X-COM""?  They basically thought it looked cute as an original IP, but not as something bearing the name X-COM.  So, priorities switched.  [XCOM is currently being rebuilt as a third person squad shooter a la Gears of War](http://www.gamesradar.com/xcom-fps-may-become-third-person-squad-shooter/), a small and downloadable one at that, while the Firaxis strategy game was being retooled for a full AAA release.  AND IT EXPLODED.

They added something very interesting (though I'm not sure if this was planned the whole time), which is a narrative backbone from the beginning to end game.  The original was less directed.  There was a story - to an extent - but it wasn't nearly as pronounced as it is here.  The game has a sparse selection of cutscenes and audio logs designed to give the player a narrative throughline, which it does real well.

The question is, what is the story they're telling?

It's sort of old hat.  An inexplicably diverse group of extraterrestrials invade the earth and start abducting people.  The XCOM project launches to save the day, but it's underfunded and just getting off the ground.  YOU have to lead XCOM to figure out what the hell you're dealing with (hence, ""Enemy Unknown"" - also a combination of the original's two different titles).  As you go on, you hire soldiers, capture enemies, dissect and interrogate them and adapt their technology in order to save the human race.

But is that what happens?

Well yes, [there's the Roland Emmerich moment at the end where everyone is cheering](/spoiler).  Humanity wins. But as your chief engineer, Dr. Shen keeps paying lip service to, ""at what cost?""  Again, this is quite a common trope in science fiction.  Then again, [look at what Dr. Vahlen's interrogations look like](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=117664183).  What are the aliens doing the whole time?  They're abducting humans, and testing them.  At one point though, they switch tactics.  [They begin testing XCOM by forcing combat situations.  Eventually XCOM begins testing its own soldiers for Psychic potential.  You find a few.  You then give one of them extra powers (the volunteer),](/spoiler) which leads to the final mission.

The first line?

[""You have succeeded where we have failed.](/spoiler)

Now, this isn't very original, of course.  Yet it's interesting that the narrative throughline they present has a pretty anti-war message.  There's a bit of a metaphor for the Cold War there, but also anti-war on terror a bit.  In this version, the XCOM aliens are definitely terrorists pushing an ideology.  An ideology which, by the end of the game [you adopt - abduction, interrogation, adaptation](/spoiler).  Of course, you get a heroes' ending.  Everything is cool. 

""But at what cost?""

Honestly though, I'd love to see a sequel or expansion in which XCOM goes and invades Mars or something, and you can play an alien and XCOM campaign.

Anyway, it was a passing thought I'm reading way too much into.

Also, the schadenfreude one feels when watching those interrogations is really odd to me.  Are we justifying torture?  Or not.  Especially after those things (yes, I'm dehumanizing) killed so many of your fellow soldiers.

Okay, Nintendo has made these games. They are their intellectual property. I believe they also have a clause for buying their games that you are not allowed to exhibit their games without their permission.

First sale doctrine according to Wikipedia:
""17 U.S.C. §109(c) creates a limited exception to a copyright owner's public display right. Owner of a lawful copy of a copyrighted work can, without permission from the copyright owner, display that copy to viewers present at the place where the copy is located. For example, an owner of copy of a computer program (and only a computer program under §109(c)) cannot display the copy publicly on a website under this provision.""

Let's play videos are not solely the realm of intellectual property rights as a lot of the content is often provided by the author of the video, it's not just exclusive to Nintendo. I realise this is what is causing a lot of the retaliation against Nintendo's approach.

As I understand it, and I may be wrong, Nintendo's adverts will just be like youtube's ads. It's not going to change the video's in the eyes of the viewers. They're not blocking the videos. The only difference will be that Nintendo will be making money from their adverts... And since the let's play will be about a Nintendo game surely the author of the video and their fans like Nintendo enough to want them to do well?

Let's plays have become very popular now meaning it is harder for companies to cast a blind eye, they are a force to be reckoned with. I know a lot of people do not buy some games as they have watched a let's play which go through the whole thing, they don't need to buy it to experience it. Some let's play videos don't cover so much of the game that they'd make buying it unnecessary but that doesn't mean other videos aren't losing them customers. This is bad for any company.

It is unfortunate that the people who make the let's play videos will not be making money, if they are doing this for a living then it is clearly problematic for them. However, why would you base your income on such a rocky venture? Based on the current, arguably outdated laws, making all your income from let's plays is perhaps not the soundest idea. Since people are already getting their full income from let's play videos though I realise making them lose their income is a bad idea, especially as they're advertising for Nintendo. Nintendo can't actually be advocating the people behind the let's play videos though as then they would need to agree to not say things which Nintendo will be blamed for.

I don't know if this is the best approach for Nintendo to take but I do think that they're not entirely in the wrong. I think they are losing customers due to let's plays, but that their reaction is perhaps not the best for their image in the media. What do you think about their choice? What do you think they should have done instead?

1366085120.0,196,self.truegaming,1cfvtv,Digital Currencies,Trucidar,269,73,75,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1cfvtv/digital_currencies/,"This month EA has begun shutting down many of their Facebook games. They are offering no refunds on remaining balances, basically telling people to spend money on things they will not be able to use within weeks.

Personally, if businesses do not allow for direct payment of a service using real dollars, I think this practise should be illegal. I believe that digital currencies should be offered the same laws and consumer protections that gift cards and store vouchers are seeing implemented. (For example, gift cards not being able to expire)

If a retail brick and mortar store suddenly said that all gift cards were going to be void within a month, simply because they are taking the store in a different direction... I cannot see this as going over smoothly.

Now this hypothetical gift card outrage would arise over a completely optional purchase. You do not need to buy gift cards to make purchases at these stores. With digital currencies, this is often not the case. They are basically forcing all customers to use a gift card system, ensuring that the company profits from unused currency. That said, that currency is often valid until the company is forced to shut down. With this recent case, this is very much not the case.

In my opinion, legal efforts should be made to ensure that companies that force people to buy into a digital currency system have certain protections. In fact, I think an ideal solution would be to force companies to allow people to at least have the option of using real currency for individual purchases. (For example, steam allows you to pay directly, or out of a steam wallet) People do not buy digital currency so that they can have a little number next to their account. They buy it under the assumption that it will get them certain products and services. In this situation, people who spent money on digital currency are basically being told that their currency is worthless. This can occur in legitimate circumstances such as businesses going bankrupt in which case this is an accepted risk you take. But should it occur when a company in healthy economic standing decides it's simply going in another direction? To make a comparison, I feel this situation is vaguely similar to the situation in Cyprus where banks are using their customers money to bail the country out... except in this situation... there is no issue, they are simply taking the money. EA allowed people to put forward money for future services, and has now decided to pull out of their responsibilities to provide those services, while keeping the customers money.

Now personally, I am not affected by this decision, but it does have implications for digital currencies in general. I've always felt that being forced to use companies digital currencies is anti-consumerist and goes against consumer rights, flouting rules against refunds, etc. I daresay, I don't feel they should be legal unless protected. I feel you should have the choice between paying with real dollars or using the currency.

I question the legitimacy of the currencies altogether. These currencies are obviously systems for generating higher incomes and forcing people to spend more than they really would.

They:

* Encourage people to buy more than they need by only allowing purchases in arbitrary set amounts. 
* Encourage people to leave money unspent by leaving you with odd/unspendable amounts of currency that are not enough to buy anything of use.
* Encourage people to throw money away because when you are left with, for example 80MS points, what will you do? You can either buy more points and make use of your money, or waste it on a frivolous 80MS item.
* Mislead customers with strange conversions. 800ms points is $10. People will look at an item marked at 800, and because the human brain isn't overly great at quick spur of the moment conversions, underestimate the price of the product. On top of that, in Canada 800MS points is $12, despite relatively equal currency values, yet products are still marketed in Canada as being at the $10 price point (800MS).
* As this most current example points out, they are susceptable to arbitrary voiding. Despite the company still being in business, customers are basically screwed out of their remaining balance. Considering that Facebook games allow for purchases of $100-200, often with the promise of bonus currency, I imagine EA is going to make a hefty profit from undelivered services in this deal.
* Diminish consumer rights regarding refunds, as any protections to dispute or charge-back payments may leave your account and the money on it completely inaccessible.
* Limited use via uneven usage of currency. This is when companies have two stores. A store using the digital currency and a store using real currency. Examples include Blizzard and World of Tanks. Even though you may have money invested in their digital currency, that money for some unseemly reason cannot be used to buy all their products, it is bound in limitations.

To point out that this is not a purely anti-EA rant, I personally have always felt MS points to be extremely guilty of misleading customers towards overspending, and I also disagreed vehemently with Blizzards digital wallet. With this system, you could sell items, but if you wished to cash out, you had to do so immediately or your money was permanently stuck in a blizzard wallet. This would not be so bad, but Blizzard than limited what sort of purchases could be made with this digital wallet. World of Tanks does this with it's gold currency, which is unusable in it's gift store (A store where limited edition and gift items are often sold, meaning even if you have a balance in their digital currency, you must spend more to make a purchase in the gift store.)

In summary, I've always begrudgingly accepted digital currencies despite all their disadvantages, but this latest incident has heaped yet another massive anti-consumer practise to an already heaping pile. Is it honestly ok for our currencies to be liquidated on a whim by a company that easily has the ability to transfer the currency to it's other products?

The OP makes an interest observation that the ""What's reddit playing?"" feature has only been filled in by 2322 users while the total subscription of r/gaming is 1,097,185 meaning it's only filled in by 0.2% of the subreddit's users which OP goes on to point out that if everyone who visits r/gaming took 10 minutes to fill out the survey, very interesting user data could come up. 

With a potential sample size of over one million people which can be filled out weekly r/gaming is a statistician's wet dream. The only other data source comparable to this would be retail sales data and steam's user data. All have issues but together the industry could potentially obtain data that could only help developers. 

Unfortunately after reading the comments I feel the community wastes this potentially powerful tool. The comment section consists of user's being spiteful to the OP for him point out Katawa Shoujo as a potential outsider in the current data(which is totally valid, it is the odd one out in top 10 of established games and that currently it's total torrent seeds about 2800). Hardly any of the comments discuss the OP's main point about the potential of this data. I can't help but feel the r/gaming community as dropped the ball on this one but some good did come out of this post.

The total users now utilising the What's reddit playing? has doubled to 4273 users meaning the OP did persuaded readers to use the feature even though it was minimum. Yet interesting data still occurred including runescape plummeting down the list while LoL, SC2 and Skyrim's user count exponentially increased. Also this front page publicity could only be good for Katawa Shoujo developers.

I can't help but feel this is a missed opportunity and it would be interesting to hear other opinions on this or other features that haven't been used to it's full potential.

1345280849.0,195,self.truegaming,yf7t3,"Classic Doom and Why it's Still Fun
",WirtThePegLeggedBoy,291,96,92,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/yf7t3/classic_doom_and_why_its_still_fun/,"As a hobbyist game designer I believe you must play games if you want to make games. At least, fun/successful ones. Going through my library I always deviate to one of my trusty fallbacks. This time, it was Doom. I wanted to play Doom 3, since it's been a while, but Classic Doom will always be a close personal favorite of mine. So when I get bored playing through a single player campaign of Doom 3, I'll skip around a few levels in the classic Doom games, and honestly, I'm having a more enjoyable time playing the older games. So what follows will be simply observations, it'll neither be a rant nor praise, although I must admit I am a little biased towards older games, I'm having a harder and harder time finding a nextgen game that I can get ""lost"" in.

First of all, the overall premise. Obviously classic Doom is about fast-paced action. But as a gamer I feel it's important to have a sense of reason behind the madness to a game, and with Doom it's simple yet brilliant. Mega-conglomerate experimentation on trans-dimensional teleportation on Mars opens rift into Hell itself, and demon legions invade unto the human race, killing millions. Badass, true, but still enough opportunity to fall flat. I loved Painkiller but the love interest story arc is just too hokey, and not motivating enough. The fact that the Doomguy just doesn't give a shit about anything besides killing demons is awesome. Or maybe its because Romero and company left much of the story open-ended, allowing the player to fill in the gaps.

Next, the level design. Classic Doom has been both praised and panned for it's abstract level design. Why play a level called Hangar when it resembles nothing like an actual hangar? Because an actual hangar isn't fun. It's boring. As gaming moved along, it became trendy to have the level design mimic real life more and more, unfortunately for players like myself this removes the player even further from the fantasy world that a player can get immersed in. Level design in the classic Doom games allowed the player to zip around, circle strafe around monsters and pick up all sorts of power-up goodies. It also allowed the level designer to build traps, alcoves, arenas, corridors, anything dedicated to the slaughter of countless enemies with a few thrills along the way. I must admit on a personal note, my favorite version of Doom is the Playstation port. The colored sectors, 16-bit sound effects, and ambient soundtrack really brings out the best Doom experience. (Note: that's not to say modern FPS's don't have their own abstract qualities in their level design. My favorite example is BioShock 2. The first game was all about experiencing the tragedy of Rapture, the second game was mostly about splicer killing and the level design, although loyal to Rapture's art deco theme, was plenty abstract, and fun to play in.  

Finally, and this point is my favorite, yet confusing and convoluted, the sprites. Almost every jab uttered about the ""good ol' days"" in gaming pokes fun at how pixilated everything was. Yes, there were tons of huge, ugly pixels. But that never deterred me. If I find myself sneering at the pixels of an old game, it's because I spoiled myself by playing a more current game too recently. And yes, there were many games where the flat sprites in a 3D environment were downright terrible (read: Witchaven) and yet Doom got it right. For the most part, all the angles are fairly believable, the walk cycles aren't terrible (but at 4 frames they aren't great, either) and the edges are nice and clean and the monsters and figures have been rendered beautifully. I find myself tearing open a WAD just to study the Cyberdemon sprite, solely as an art piece, let alone a functioning asset in a game. I would also like to mention, and this again is a matter of opinion so bear with me, but I haven't seen a satisfying monster death since Doom. By using the sprites, the artists were able to come up with some pretty grisly deaths, and it just ads to the satisfaction of felling a bad guy. I'd rather see pixelated intestines and bodily fluid spill all over the floor, than see polygons be, well, polygons. I mentioned above that I'm simultaneously playing Doom 3 and I must ask, where the hell ate the gibs???
 
Finally, consider this.  When was the last time you teleported in a game? Seriously, think about that.  Teleporters were once a popular mechanic in games, but now that games are ""realistic"", the rules just don't allow it. How thrilling.

Well anyway, those are just my late night thoughts on a recent game binge I've been on this past week. And I say binge because, as mentioned, I'm having a difficult time discovering new games to lose myself in, and my frequency of picking up a controller is becoming less and less. I'm interested to hear anyone's thoughts, do you prefer old school game mechanics, or is there anything about the current batch of games that trumps the antiques? Let me know! Like I said, I'm researching for a new project of my own, I'd like to hear what people would be willing to play. Cheers! :)

Blah blah blah, doesn't work, yadda yadda yadda.

Instead of a simple yes/no vote with cream of the crop at the top, what if it changed into a sort of virtual 'pre-order'?  That is, Steam charges you the pre-determined greenlight price of the game (it could even be a discount to encourage early adopters), holds the funds for about 30 days, and if a certain financial number is hit, the game is greenlit and you get that game added to your inventory.  If those 30 days pass and the number is not hit, you are refunded the money.

Pros:  
1) Teenagers who just spend all day yessing zombies are suddenly cut out of the equation.  
2) It tells Steam ""yes, this game IS successful.""  Not even a will-be, but is.  
3) Ensures that devs have a chance without necessarily needing to maintain 80k+ votes.  
4) ???

Cons:  
1) People hate spending money on a maybe.  
2) Getting to that ALMOST number will be infuriating for devs.  
3) Steam could possibly abuse their power and reimburse the money via steam wallet instead of the method received (though this would be a pro for Steam, it's a consumer con).

* Why don't FPS games realistically show death?

Dishonored did a good job covering this by having the city become more and more infected the more you killed, so you knew the corpses you made were having an effect.


* Why is enemy AI still so weak after 20 years of this genre? In Far Cry 3, for example, if I'm an enemy pirate commanding an outpost and I notice that 3 of my guards haven't returned from patrol, shouldn't I go investigate? It's been discussed before, but what about enemy surrender? If you're the last pirate, wouldn't you throw down your weapons or make a run for it?

I played Cities XL fairly recently and whilst I liked some of the features, on the whole it wasn't particularly well done (the interface was absolutely dreadful for instance) but having revisited Sim City 4 (which still maintains an incredibly strong and longevitous community of players and mod developers) it's really showing its age nowadays.

One idea I think is really strong is algorithmic building generation. One of the main distractions of Sim City and other city games was the pretty crippling recurrence of the same few building models. it seems to me that because the game already creates metrics for land value, pollution, etc, then it would be a good way to avoid that problem by generating buildings based on them, perhaps with land value relating to height, pollution relating to cleanliness, etc and then adding randomly selected (by building type) 'flair' to make each building visually distinct and unique, be that sculptural elements, helipads, wall texture types, or whatever. The same could be done for civic buildings (though they would obviously have to have clear identifying flair, perhaps relating to colour scheme or signage). That way I feel you'd get a lot more of an organic skyline, like in real-world cities. Moreover, as the land value and other metrics in an area rose or fell, the buildings being built would vary, giving a sense of actual change over time. I liked Sim City 4's attempt at showing decay as buildings fell out of use, but I'd like for it to maybe be more gradual. Ultimately each building would only have to be generated when constructed, the generation perhaps being part of the construction time, so I don't think it'd be too taxing for modern systems.

Something I did like about Cities XL was the ability to specify the routes for mass transit, which was something that always phased me about Sim City. It introduces a whole new level of gameplay - rather than simply building an array of bus stops, you actually have to connect them in an effective way. Routes on subways could take this even further.

Something I think was a good idea in Sim City 3000/4 that perhaps for technical reasons was never explored was the more bureaucratic side, advisors and ordinances specifically. I think maybe having a range of advisors for each department who would have, or maybe even unlock, their own tactics for the running their individual department would work well. One transport advisor could have emphasis on making sure everyone in the city was provided for, unlocking policies such as being able to construct ultra-small and cheap bus stops for rural areas, whilst another advisor could be focused solely on solvency, allowing the mayor to perhaps use cheaper, lower quality buses for instance. I'd also like to see more of a sense of community in game, through protests, parades, fairs and things of that nature. Being able to establish a city fair for a week in a part of town could bring some income to the city at the cost of a slight and temporary increase in local crime, maybe. If you called them too often, maybe people would start losing interest and they'd become less profitable. Ordinances on the whole had too little visible effect in my opinion. They usually meant the difference between a few simoleons in the budget and little else. I like the idea of each city having its own feel. I don't think it's fun for each and every city to be an aspirational NYC. What if my city is an aspirational Detroit or Paris or Brasilia or Velthaupstadt Germania? 

I liked the inclusion of the region map in Sim City 4, though building connections between cities was a nightmare. And it'd be fun for smaller cities to maybe grow together and combine administration, or for distant parts of a large map to decide to strike it out as their own communities. City limits borders are very rarely perfectly rectangular - they could, though, start out this way and become more organic over time. I'd also (possibly) like to see region-wide governance, with decrees having different effects on cities depending on how they're managed.

However, I'm of the opinion that ""but it's fun"" has very little place in actual discussion on (relatively) objective quality. Sure, I enjoy Michael Bay films, but that doesn't make them quality cinema. If the only standard we set for the games industry is that it's ""fun"" to some people, then the market will be flooded even more with Angry Birds and Cut the Rope. I won't argue for a second that those games weren't fun, but they hardly do anything for gaming as an art form. Our standards need to be somewhat objective if we're going to see our favorite hobby mature into something more accepted as art on the whole. Of course, fun is kind of the core prerequisite for a game, but it's possible to have fun playing around with MS Paint. That doesn't make it an award-winning game.

And if shameless plugging is frowned upon, I'll remove the link.

The post:

While the biggest feather in their hat has always been their open worlds, Bethesda Game Studios’s games always begin with a linear and scripted introductory sequence before you’re let loose into the open world.  In The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion you begin in a jail cell and proceed to fight through a dungeon and sewers, before escaping.  In Fallout 3, your character has lived in an underground nuclear bomb shelter known as Vault 101 all their life, before a series of events forces them to leave their home and face the unknown world outside.

It may seem like a counterintuitive design choice to begin with a set path for the player if the rest of the game emphasizes freedom of choice, but it does serve a purpose.  These intro sequences do three important things:  they allow the player to learn basic game mechanics like combat and speech in a controlled environment; they give the player time to learn about the world, characters, and themes of the game without being dropped headfirst into the world and feeling lost; and, most importantly, by initially limiting player exploration, they serve to make the reveal of the open world much more powerful.  Emerging from the sewers in Oblivion, or from Vault 101 in Fallout 3 were both awe-inspiring moments.  You simply had to stop and look around, reeling in the notion that everything laid before you was waiting to be explored.  These moments are what Bethesda games do best.  That feeling of truly being in a world bigger than you can imagine.  A world teeming with life and stories that you can only hope to discover.

But why doesn’t Skyrim‘s reveal feel like that?  At least in my experience, leaving the caves beneath Helgen and seeing Skyrim for the first time felt simply empty and uninviting, nothing like the moments from Oblivion and Fallout.  It has a similar linear intro sequence and subsequent reveal of the open world, but being set free into Skyrim doesn’t have the same impact as in Oblivion or Fallout.

The problem can be found in the very first moments the player is presented with after emerging into the world.  That initial view of the world is critical to the feeling of freedom, and Skyrim‘s presentation, along with a few contextual elements hurt that feeling.  So let’s take a look at what Oblivion and Fallout 3 did right, and what Skyrim did wrong.

[Oblivion First View] (http://protogeektheblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/oblivion-first-view1.jpg)

This is the first thing you see after completing Oblivion‘s intro sequence.  You’ve just fought off assassins, goblins, and giant rants through barely-lit catacombs, caves, and sewers.  You look up and this is what you see.  Everything about this landscape is designed to make you want to explore the world.  The green hills and blue sky are a stark contrast to the dark, dank sewers you just left and make the world seem inviting.  The first thing your eye is likely drawn to are the ruins, nearly dead center on the screen.  Immediately, the game gives you something to explore (and some bandits to kill), a promise that the world will be filled with places like this one full of danger and mystery, waiting to be found by you.  The rolling hills on the right hand side of the screen are clearly flat enough that you can hike over them, tempting the player to see what’s on the other side and, once again making the player feel like the world is open for exploring.  The large mountains on the left and in the distance give an impression of the world’s massive size.

[Fallout 3 First View](http://protogeektheblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/fallout-3-first-view.jpg)

The view presented in Fallout 3, just after leaving Vault 101 is quite different from Oblivion‘s.  The bright, friendly colors have been replaced with brown, brown, and brown.  Instead of having most our view blocked by hills and mountains like in Oblivion, we’re instead perched up on a cliff able to see the desolate, wasted landscape extending far out into the horizon.  And yet Fallout‘s world feels just as inviting as Oblivion even with this depressing view.  Part of this is due to our expectations for the game.  This is exactly what we want to see when playing a post-apocalyptic game.  Oblivion‘s cheery colors work well for its high fantasy tone, but in Fallout we want to experience the harshness of life without society and order, and that’s exactly what we get.  Also important are the easily recognizable American landmarks on the horizon.  We’re shown barely more than silhouettes of the Capitol Building and the Washington Monument, but seeing real life locations mangled and ruined is an intriguing tease and tempts the player to come find them.

[Skyrim First View](http://protogeektheblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/skyrim-first-view.jpg)

And this is the view after escaping Helgen in Skyrim.  It’s certainly lovely to look at, but it doesn’t inspire the same temptation to explore as Oblivion and Fallout‘s vista.  Like Fallout, the player is once again up high looking down on a landscape, but, like in Oblivion, part of that landscape is obscured, this time by tall trees.  The mountains on the side and in the background look jagged, steep, and hard to climb.  Unlike Oblivion‘s rolling hills, Skyrim‘s mountains initially look more like barriers to exploration than invitations for it.  The player is also set on a path that winds down the hillside with rocks on either side blocking the path in.  This naturally encourages the player to stick to the path and discourages the player from deviating from it.

There are also a number of elements besides the landscape that distract from or hurt that feeling of awe in the world and the temptation to explore it.  First, both Fallout and Oblivion begin indoors.  It’s not until after the intro sequence that you finally see the outdoors for the first time.  In Skyrim, the very first moment of the game is outdoors as you ride in a cart through a forest and into Helgen.  Just about half of the game’s opening sequence takes place outside as you’re almost executed, and proceed to escape from the dragon attack.  Despite the second half of the intro being indoors and underground, that moment of magic we should feel when seeing Skyrim‘s wild terrain is partially stolen by the very first moments in the game.

Second, Fallout and Oblivion make leaving the intro and entering the world feel like an event.  In both games, you have to activate a door before leaving their respective intros.  You’re then prompted with a “Finalize Character” type screen, where you confirm your character’s look and skills.  This helps create a clear line with what came before and what comes next.  It let’s the player know that the real game is about to begin.  In Skyrim, the character and class stuff has all been streamlined, so there’s no need for a screen like that.  Instead, you simply walk out of a cave.  There’s no feeling that you’re truly leaving the intro behind and entering the world.

Lastly, Skyrim has two NPCs exit into the world with you after the intro: either a Stormcloak or Imperial soldier, and the dragon that flies overhead.  There’s a small scripted moment where the soldier takes cover as the dragon leaves Helgen and flies off.  Then the soldier begins to walk down the path, and gives a bunch of dialogue about going to a nearby town.  The player is distracted from that special moment of seeing the game world for the first time by these two characters and this moment.  Instead of marveling at the world you can explore, you have to pretend to hide from a dragon and have some guy you don’t care about give you your next quest.

Now, for the disclaimer:  I LOVE Skyrim.  Like, seriously, love this game.  Like, favorite game of all time material.  But this is one big flaw I noticed the first time I played it in 2011, and I noticed it again after getting the game gifted to me on Steam just recently.  Bethesda games are all about the open world, and Oblivion and Fallout do such a good job of making that world feel accessible, inviting, and interesting in those first few moments of seeing it.  But in Skyrim they somehow managed to totally screw it up.  It’s just a good thing the rest of the game is absolutely filled with moments that make up for it.

1369962219.0,197,self.truegaming,1fdioh,Are Nintendo's fans ruining the company?,walkingdisasterFJ,491,294,423,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1fdioh/are_nintendos_fans_ruining_the_company/,"Let me start off by saying I don't hate Nintendo, but I don't love them either. I grew up on the N64 and gamecube like a lot of kids, but the wii is where I started to fall out of love with Nintendo. I switched to the xbox in 2010 and really haven't looked back at the wii, and before any wii fans start throwing their favorite titles at me and tell me to play them since they came out after 2010 and they might change my mind about the wii, my scheldue is busy enough already and I don't really have the time to add more games to the pile I want to play. And besides, this has less to do with Nintendo games and more with its fans.
Every time I read an article/thread about the wii u, there is always, ALWAYS, at least one comment saying ""just remake Majora's Mask/Mario 64/-insert popular game for the past consoles here- for the Wii U and I'll be happy"" and this just drives me up the wall. Is that really all you want, to literally play the same game over and over? I know that's not really ALL they want, but that mentality seems to be hanging over Nintendo fans recently. Whenever the wii u gets criticized for its lack of games, everyone says ""wait for the first zelda/mario/Metroid game. It's not a Nintendo console until those franchises are out"" and that really does seem to have some truth to it not because those are the faces of Nintendo, but because those are the only franchises that Nintendo fans seem to want. Instead of recommending the current wii u games, the fans just say wait for the same old franchises we've been playing for the last 20 years. Why should Nintendo take the risk of new IPs when the fans scream for remakes of games from 1996? Why should Nintendo take the risk of new IPs when the fans say ""fuck the current wii u games, just wait for the main franchises, then it's a real console"". 
I'm not saying Nintendo should axe all their franchises, but I feel like they should take more risks. I can't really think of any wii games that tried new stuff like the way some gamecubes games did. But then it goes back to ""why should they if all the fans want the same franchises?"" 

I understand not every Nintendo fan thinks this way and there are plenty of fans who want new IPs and enjoy the new wii u games, but I do see some Nintendo fans acting like this.

I could go on and on, but I feel like I'd just be retreading the same ground. The underlying question remains the same: Do you think Nintendo fans are ruining the company? Or do you think there's nothing wrong with Nintendo and are fine with the direction they're taking? Or do you think everything I've said is total bullshit and Nintendo isn't changing at all? I understand I may have pissed off a lot of people with some of these statements, but this is a thought that's been rolling around in my head since I jumped to the xbox and I want to hear other thoughts.

EDIT: I feel like some people are missing the point of my post. I have nothing wrong with IPs I listed above or Nintendo as a whole. And I understand they need these IPs to stay afloat, but that's not the point of my post. My question was are the FANS going to ruin the company with the attitude of only wanting to play certain franchises. Some people don't see a problem with only focusing on certain franchises since it's what the fans want, but that's kind of my point. Is this going to become a circle? Since fans only want the same IPs, are Nintendo only going to focus on those IPs and nothing else worth playing is going to come out on the wii u? As we've seen many times in the past, you can only milk a franchise for so long. Mario and Zelda may have withstood the test of time so far, but some fans are eventually going to grow tired of these franchises if that's all that's good about the console. That's basically what happened to me, I couldn't really find any other games I liked on the wii outside of the main franchises, so when I got tired of mario and zelda I started to look elsewhere.

Also I know the other consoles do this too with Uncharted/Halo, but I just want to focus on Nintendo because, like other people stated, I have yet to hear ""I'm not going to buy the xbox one until Halo comes out"".

The sense of thrill and adrenaline you get from watching Heat, or Ocean's Eleven, or the bank robbery from The Dark Knight is fantastic. Watching a perfectly planned heist be executed flawlessly is extremely satisfying. Sadly, this feeling of beating the powerful with just your planning and skills has never been captured in a game.

Sure, there have been a couple of heist missions. The one from GTA IV, the multiplayer from Kane and Lynch, etc. Even some heist based games, like Payday: The Heist. All of this have been extremely simplistic though, and require basically no planning or strategy... just shooting.

I believe there are two relevant games being develop with heists as their core. The first one is Payday 2. Though you can see how the devs are making an effort on making it more than a glorified L4D clone, they still miss the point. It's not just about giving you the option to be stealthy, or giving you tools to delay the police or hasten your operations.
The same goes for the other heist game being developed, Monaco. It gives a great emphasis in giving you lots of tools, such as hacking computers, breaching safes via explosives, subduing guards, etc. However, you're always improvising with this systems. Never executing a perfect plan, but using what you find in your surroundings. You're more like a scavenger, less like a mastermind. And that's what a heist game should make you feel like; a mastermind, a con man.


It's about beating a security system, in the broadest sense possible, with your brains. 
Not through shooting your way through or infiltrating like in a stealth game, but through becoming knowledgeable about the targets security system, finding a way to exploit it, planning this exploit, and finally, at the climax, executing your plan. It should be 90% strategy, 10% execution. And at the execution itself, you shouldn't feel like you're improvising, but as if you are acting in a highly choreographed play. 

Sometimes, it should be more about crowd control, about containing them, calming them, using them. 

Some other times, about disabling defenses, about rendering each of their security precautions useless. Their fancy cameras, their vaults, their alarms, their automatically police call, etc. 

And sometimes, about misdirection. Less about being stealthy and not being seen, and more about tricking the people you're stealing from, about putting the spotlight and their attention to where nothing is happening, about making them look left, when you metaphorically go right. 

But most importantly, all of this through strategy and planning, not through improvisation and action. Again, the execution should be the result of all the heavy work, go exactly as planned, and have a touch of showmanship to heighten the sense of being outsmarting your targets. 

To be honest, I've been giving this a lot of thought, and giving that I'm looking for a game developing project, I may give this genre a shot. But I'd like to know your opinion on my points, and your thoughts on what would make a perfect heist game. Who knows, I may actually follow through an deliver (Disclaimer: I probably won't. Blame Reddit for my procrastination).

It is F***ing incredible. I am peeled to the screen. Ive heard so much positive talk about it and I am thoroughly impressed. A couple things that I have noticed:


1. Reading dialogue is much more engaging than full voice-overs. I would go so far to say that reading dialogue is what made Morrowind better than Oblivion. More dialogue options are possible and so many more things can be communicated. Example: You approach a 2D sprite character and talk to him; ""You approach an old ragged man with warts and scabs all over his face. He looks almost dead, but part of you feels that he is more alive than all others in the village square."" A game like skyrim would have to spend days making a character look unique, spend more time animating the character to be unique and believable; and you still would not have reached this level of engagement. 



2. The combat is based on advanced dungeons and dragons and I now realize why this is awesome. I guess Morrowind was much like that. And it makes sense for MMORPGs to use that system as well. In my opinoin its a better way of translating the complexities of real combat into a video game. I dont have a good way of explaining this yet.



3. 2D sprites and the backgrounds are so much better at transmitting the artist aesthetic vision. Especially the sprites. Think Diablo 2 sprites vs Diablo 3 3d models.

 FO3 had an amazing atmosphere, no matter how many times I play it, it just has this feel to it that gives me chills. However, it didn't work so well with the rest of the franchise. It's like Bethesda took a lot of central Fallout themes  (Super Mutants, Ghouls, Power Armor, Enclave, radiation, apocalypse, 1950's America) and made a game without prior knowledge of the older games. References to other parts of the country were few and far between, along with any mention of the past games. Another thing that didn't make much sense is how uncivilized it was, while the NCR wasn't established in the area it was significantly less populated than New Vegas, and it just didn't make sense for the time period (Felt like 10 years after the bombs fell). On its own however, Fallout 3 was an amazing game, and it did something better than any other Fallout game I had ever played, and that was atmosphere.







Now on to New Vegas. Much much *MUCH* more civilized. While it wasn't as gritty and morally black and white as FO3 it made more sense. Even when their ideals were fucked up, every group had some sort of warped reality in their favor. A gray area that gave each play through a depth that FO3 didn't have, much more realistic. It also worked well as a Fallout game, it had very well established lore and the gameplay was much better. Even if you haven't played previous Fallout's, references to NCR history and other settlements out in the wastes makes it feel a lot more like a *Fallout* title, rather than an apocalypse one. One of things I didn't like about NV was the fact that it had you on a somewhat set path for the first 10 levels or so. With minor sidepaths you could take (unless you brave the path straight to NV, which the game makes clear it doesn't want you to do.) At times it also lacks an apocalyptic feel, but that comes with civilization I suppose.




The problem is I don't know if Bethesda will be able to pull of an amazing atmosphere, along with lore *and* civilization. It seems like a contradiction, because part of what made the Fallout 3 atmosphere so great was the waste-landish feel, and with all the rumors going around about the Boston setting, I fear it will lack what made Fallout 3 great.

I looked for the alternative in every situation and made absolute sure that I never ended a guard's life. Perhaps he (guard) was a good man in just the wrong place, right? 

A while into the game, I had a bunch of extra runes (currency for upgrades), and ended up with a power I didn't have a use for. With this upgrade, killing enemies silently reduced them to ash, erasing all traces of the body and eliminating the need to hide it. 

During a later mission, I was in a crowded room and I had found that sweet spot where I could cross the room while all the guards were preoccupied. Suddenly, I heard ""huh?"" and wheeled around to realize a guard had seen me. 

This was a big moment, if he sounded the alarm, lord Regent would retreat to his safe room and the mission would become significantly harder. 

I could fire a sleep dart and knock him out (as I usually did) but the other guards were mere feet away. There simply wasn't time. 

In a matter of milliseconds, I scanned the room for places to hide the body. It wasn't enough, the guards were turning now, each of their states of alarm growing higher. The first guard opened his mouth as if to exclaim and...

I froze time. His mouth half open, hand in his pistol. The room was still, save for the twitch in my hands. I stepped forward and looked into his face. I felt connected with him, empathetic. I gazed at him and all the rest of the guards. It was beautiful. Suddenly he moved, the perfect image was broken. 

In an instant, without hardly thinking, I did something I hadn't done thus far. 

I rushed forward, and slit his throat. I watched his body fade to ash and them my screen went red. A bullet had struck me. I dashed across the room, jumping and utilizing the blink power to cross to the other side of a security barrier. Before they saw where I went, I rewired the barrier's circuits to repel them. 

I stood behind the barrier, sword drawn, and watched the horde of guards rush toward me. 

The barrier was in fact lethal. As the guards rushed through to me, unaware of their impending fate, they       all screamed, their bodies fading to ash, much like the first guard.

Suddenly it was silent. There were no guards, but in less than a minute, I'd raised my body count from 0 to 12. 

Corvo wasn't like this. He wasn't a killer. I wasn't a killer.

As I progressed through the mission, I began to kill guards purely out of spite. I stopped regarding their lives, and simply began murdering them in drives. I went so far as to rewire a turret and watch them die one by one. 

Suddenly my body count read 27.

31.

37.

I changed. I went from a force of justice to one of death. I'd experienced the power of the outsider's mark, and its overwhelming power had driven me to abandon my morals. As I wrapped up the mission and returned to home base, many of my allies had grown skeptical and distant. 

What had happened? Killing an enemy in a game  had never in the past had this effect on me. 

This is why I would consider Dishonored one of the greatest achievements in gaming in the past ten years.

TL;DR: Becoming more powerful in dishonored drove me to abandon my predetermined morals in favor of convenience. It effected me emotionally.

Originally this post was going to be about dishonored’s moral choice system and how much I like it but I realized that at every point I compared the game favorably to bioshock. Biochock is a wonderful game with a great story (until the last hour), but I find it’s moral choice system is the epitome of everything bad about modern moral choice systems (okay, fable is worse but I can’t remember the story of one of those for more than an hour after finishing it). There is a phrase I use to describe such mechanics, I believe it comes from one of the old 1up podcasts.

**Save the baby or eat the baby**

Believe it or not the saying actually pre-dates bioshock, where that is literally the issue at hand. Moral choice systems in games are very popular right now as people realize choice is one of the most powerful tools a game has but most games fall into the trap of “behave rationally vs. be a dick for no reason“. Even my favorite series (fallout, man do I have a post brewing on that) have evil options where I find myself thinking “why would I do that?’. A lot of games get around that with morally neutral no win scenarios like walking dead, which is great, but I love the way dishonored handles things.

**Killing people is easy, not killing people is hard, but understandable**

Most of your enemies in Dishonored are guards, and it’s obvious killing them is bad. They’re just working stiffs trying to feed themselves and their families. But not killing them is very hard and the game understands if you have to. On my first play through I decided I wouldn’t kill anyone. I failed, but the game gives you leeway. You can kill like 5 guys a level and still get the good ending. Most enemies deserve to live, but if you fail your mission to restore the rightful empress many more will die. You’re not batman, you can’t be expected to not kill anyone. And besides, there are people the game would completely understand if you wanted to kill.

But you eat ONE CHILD in bioshock and you’re a dick forever. There big place bioshock fucks up is giving you adam when you don’t kill the little sisters. Making your life easier by doing bad things would make for a richer story, especially considering the game is about Randian Objectivism.


**Dishonored is more reasonable in it’s assessment of you**

On my second play through I didn’t go around killing everyone, but I killed when I had to and when I thought it was right. When cornered I would use all of my tranquilizers first but I wouldn’t reload a million times to not have to shoot them. I killed the thugs in the distillery. I killed the targets and the Madame at the whorehouse who willingly imprisoned a child. At the party I knocked out all of the guards so I could safely slaughter the entire party of nobles who beat their servants and stole from the poor. The game never called me hitler for doing this. I was put in a terrible situation and had every right to revenge. I was still the good guy in the story, I just wasn’t jesus.

I don’t need to tell you how dumb the evil ending of bioshock was.

**The consequences make sense**

If it is totally reasonable to be forced to kill, or to want to kill people in dishonored, why do you get a worse ending? Well two reasons. Number one, the city is being torn apart by the plague, and we all know poorly disposed of bodies make that whole thing worse. Second a young impressionable girl is looking up to you.

For those of you who only got one, or who read this because they don’t give a shit about spoilers, the two endings are as follows

Low Chaos: Havlok kills the other two men who betrayed you and surrenders, the plague gets better, Emily is a just and fair ruler.

High Chaos: Havlok makes you kill him in front of Emily, Emily tells you she all ready decided she would have him killed. The ending monologue says Emily was remembered not as a woman who rose to power on a pile of corpses but a empress who did her best in a world that is not kind.

Emily is learning from your example, and just as you kill people knowing that your doing the best you can so does she.

What’s great is that high chaos is not a bad ending. Shit’s rough, but you got through it. No one can tell you you where wrong in what you did and the world is better for your involvement.

The cause and effect in most games moral choices seems a bit like the hand of god is coming down, slapping you, and patiently explaining that eating little girls is bad. You killed a little girl because you thought you needed to in order to save yourself and the rest of the civilians of rapture? Guess what, you’re mutant hitler and you’re about to nuke the world.

This is a stark contrast to a few friends who will swear up and down to the greatness of the Nintendo 64. Don't get me wrong, I have very fond memories of the system, and still find a lot of fun in it, but it feels like some people refuse to notice when a franchise changes for the better.

Two games are headlining this subject: Mario 64 and Ocarina of time. I get it, they were revolutionary, I was there. But they feel archaic to me to go back and play them. Mario Galaxy 1 &amp; 2 are both better games to me, and I have fonder memories of playing them, not because of the point in my life that I played them, but because I just thought they were better games. My friends refuse to play either SMG, and continue to praise Mario 64 blindly.

Ocarina of Time is a bit different. I am of the opinion that Twilight Princess is the best Zelda gameplay-wise, while Majora's Mask has the best story. To me, Twilight Princess took everything that I like in Ocarina (pretty much whenever you're an adult), and took out everything I didn't like (pretty much whenever you're a kid), and then added a lot of new things. There was just so much to explore. A lot of my friends will admit that Twilight Princess is a great game, but Ocarina of Time is still superior.

Basically, what I'm saying is, When comparing older games in a franchise (or even genre) to a modern counterpart, I feel like I'm in a minority in that I find modern games better most of the time. Just because a game did something first, doesn't automatically mean it was the best.

Do you think it's fair to compare older games to new in this manner? It seems to be a two-way street: a lot of people will defend older games simply for the childhood memories and that it's cool being retro, but it's hard to argue considering the limitations of the technology at the same.

EDIT: I realize when comparing games in a franchise it can turn into a pissing contest, so I'll try to give a few examples of each side of the fence of my perspective. Is it fair to judge older RPGs to newer ones? What about sandbox games, or shooters? For example, I love Chrono Trigger, it's one of my favorite games. I'd say it holds up amazingly when compared to newer games. However, Final Fantasy 4, another SNES RPG, is not a game I enjoy playing in relation to other games of the genre I could be playing. How about the first Half Life? That was an innovator, is it fair to judge it against games that took inspiration from it?

Sometimes when I go on about comparing old and new games, I feel like there's a barrier due to when they were made. Do you feel the same??",,False,,t5_2sgq6,1361306034.0,,,True,t3_18u23p,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/18u23p/is_it_okay_to_compare_games_from_older/,
1349302782.0,188,self.truegaming,10wfap,Getting started with Dwarf Fortress,docjesus,245,57,117,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/10wfap/getting_started_with_dwarf_fortress/,"**WHY DON'T MORE PEOPLE PLAY DWARF FORTRESS?**

Johan Andersson, lead programmer for Paradox Interactive, once said that he didn't think his games were that much more complex than the far more popular and accessible Civilization series - it's just that in Civilization, you start with one city and build your way up to managing a country, where in the likes of Victoria and Europa Universalis, you start with the whole country.  I'd say the same is true of Dwarf Fortress.  

I once wrote a tongue-in-cheek defence of the game using an alt, but my love for it cannot be confined to throwaway accounts.  I think Dwarf Fortress is one of the most interesting games ever made, but many people are intimidated by it, and thus never get a chance to experience it.  

I believe this is partly the fault of the community (who play up its difficulty), partly the fault of Toady (who, understandably, has more important things to focus on), and partly the fault of human beings who have a hard time breaking out of comfortable routines to experience new things.  I'm especially guilty of the last one, but when I unexpectedly pushed through my initial wariness of Dwarf Fortress, I was hooked.  

I want you to have the same fun I did, so here's the low-down on Dwarf Fortress.

* **The UI and graphics suck, and you probably need a keypad.**

There's no getting around this.  ASCII, as a graphics system, is difficult enough to parse already - if you're thrown into a fully-realised world, it's overwhelming.  The UI barely uses the mouse, and there are hundreds of keyboard shortcuts, some of which make immediate sense, many of which don't.  But don't worry, all this can be overcome.  If you don't have a keypad, I believe there are alternate keybindings you can use.  Perhaps some kind and knowledgable soul can expand on this in the comments.

* **It's not that difficult.**

Really.  It's not.  It's a lot like a fancier version of Dungeon Keeper, if you ever played that.  Does it take a bit more effort than your average game?  Sure.  Is it only for people with genius IQs and CompSci degrees?  Absolutely not - I managed to learn it, after all.  The learning curve of the game has become a running joke, and people who have played it for five minutes and uninstalled will loudly complain about its difficulty and how they're ""not going to play it without a decent UI and graphics"".  So we've got this situation where somebody will come across a DF discussion on Reddit and become interested in the game, but all they see in the comments are complaints that it's impossible, and jokes that it is too difficult for the average gamer to learn.

* **They are teaching you to play the game incorrectly.**

There's no right or wrong way to play Dwarf Fortress.  That's one of the things that's so amazing about it, its freedom.  But every time someone says ""I want to learn Dwarf Fortress, help!"" they're always directed to the [Quickstart Guide](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/DF2012:Quickstart_guide) (which does contain a lot of great information), or two hours of tutorial videos.  I don't think that's the right way to teach someone how to play a game.  

A game with a learning curve is like a musical instrument.  It requires a little bit of thinking and dedication, but once you get past the ""I have no idea what I'm doing"" stage and start making a connection here and there, you'll progress much faster and start solving problems on your own by using references.  You learn by playing.  If someone had handed me a 1000-page manual on how to play the guitar and told me to read it before touching one, I'd have given up almost instantly.  Again: you learn by playing, and playing's more fun than studying.


So how do we begin playing Dwarf Fortress?  I'm going to give you just enough information to get you started, and you can take it from there.  

Remember one thing above all else: leave your pride at the door.  We're not trying to learn every detail of the game, we're not starting 'right at the beginning', and I'm not going to give an in-depth explanation of every little thing.  All I'm going to do is get you **started**, and how much you want to master is then up to you.  Even at its most basic level the game is a ton of fun.  Think of it as picking a pre-rolled character just to get going rather than learning hundreds of stats and trying to make the perfect starting build before you even load the world.

Anything that has been skipped for the sake of easy learning can be re-enabled when you're comfortable.  Leave your pride at the door, and let's get playing.


**GETTING STARTED (AS QUICKLY AND PAINLESSLY AS POSSIBLE)**

[Download this.](http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?0ls832k81pohir9)  Extract.  Open the Lazy Newb Pack program.  Click ""Play Dwarf Fortress"".  When you get to the menu screen, press 'enter' twice.  You're in.

Using the Lazy Newb Pack, go to 'Utilities' and double-click on Dwarf Therapist.  This program allows you to assign orders and organise your dwarves.  You can do it in-game, but as someone who learned that method first and later discovered Dwarf Therapist, it's nigh-on pointless.  Use the program.  There is no reason not to, and it'll make your life a thousand times easier.


**PLAYING DWARF FORTRESS**

People say that it takes 20 hours just to learn the UI.  That is completely false.

Playing Dwarf Fortress is like going through folders on your computer, only you use the keyboard.  Say you want to build a Millstone: the shortcut is b-w-shift+m.  Incomprehensible, right?  But look on the right of the screen.  All your shortcuts are listed.  So if you want a building, just go into the ""building"" folder by pressing the shortcut that's visible, 'b'.  From there, you can move up and down and press return to select a building or subfolder, or you can press the shortcut keys.

It might take 20 hours to become slick and memorise all the shortcuts without looking, but the actual process is fairly straightforward.  You'll have the hang of it within an hour.  Just follow the shortcuts onscreen, they're all there and you don't even need to hover your mouse over for a tooltip.  Pretty handy!


**NAVIGATION**

* Use the number pad - it allows you to move diagonally.
* Arrow keys move around.  
* Return/enter to confirm.  It's like left-clicking.
* Space bar to pause.  Like Bioware and Paradox games, you pause, issue commands and unpause.  Dwarf Fortress begins paused, thankfully.
* Escape to go back.

* Press 'k' to get more information on a tile, loo(k).  Helpful when you don't know what something is.
* Press 'v' to get more information on units, (v)iew.
* Press 'q' to interact with buildings.  Move the cursor to the building you want to interact with.
* Shift + &gt; and Shift + &lt; move up and down floors or 'z levels'.  Looks a bit funny when you write it out, but give it a shot, it makes sense.

Now go ahead and unpause the game.  Don't be scared, nothing bad is going to happen.  In other areas, you might have toxic sludge raining down on you or undead giant sparrows attacking the moment you start, but here in our sandbox everything is peaceful.  You can take things at your own pace.

Everyone's just milling around at the moment, sticking mainly to the brown box that represents the wagon you arrived in.  That's because they have nothing to do.  But look!  One of your dwarves has positioned himself right next to a body of water.  He's fishing!  But why is that?  You didn't tell him to, so why'd he do it?


**ASSIGNING LABOR**

The command process is simple.  You don't control your dwarves directly, you assign them jobs, like ""miner"" for example.  Then when you want something mined, all free dwarves with the ""miner"" job (and a pickaxe) will go help.

Go back to the Dwarf Therapist program.  Dwarves on the left, jobs along the top.  Select the job you want that dwarf to do, click 'commit changes'.  Done.  Ditto for removing a job.  That little white box in the middle is their skill at that job.  It gets bigger the more skilled they are.  Cerol and Zulban have some skill in mining, so they're already miners.


**SETTING TASKS**

Tasks are mainly listed in the 'designation' menu in Dwarf Fortress.  This includes mining, carving stairs, gathering plants and chopping down trees.  You can also build things by using the 'building' menu.

So let's start by mining out some space for our dwarves to hang out in.  

* Go to the designation menu and select ""Downward Stairway"".  
* Pick a tile a few spaces north of your wagon and press enter to start your designation, and enter again to confirm it.  
* Now go down a floor (shift + &gt;) and put an ""Up/Down Stairway"" directly below your Downward Stairway.  
* Finally, switch to the ""Mine"" command and carve out some space by the Up/Down Stairway.  Instead of doing it tile by tile, press enter to start your designation, move a couple of tiles and press enter again to confirm.  It'll fill in all the space between.

Now press 'escape' to quit out of the menus and wait for a few seconds.  Look!  There's your two miners!  They're doing what you told them to do!  Some of the cats might even wander in to keep them company while they work.  They will quickly clear out some clay, leaving a nice big clear square of empty space.  Now let's get all that stuff off your wagon.


**STOCKPILES**

* Access the Stockpile menu.  You'll see there are stockpiles of many types, but you can customise your own.  
* Go to ""Custom Settings"".  
* Enable everything except corpses and refuse.  
* Press escape to go back.  
* Now select Custom Stockpile and designate the space you just cleared out as your stockpile the same way you would mine out an area.  
* Once again, press escape to quit out of the menus and wait for a few seconds.  

Look!  They're all bringing stuff and dumping it onto the pile!  That's because dwarves have the 'hauling' job enabled by default, so they'll all pitch in if there's nothing else to do.


**GO PLAY DWARF FORTRESS**

If you've followed my instructions, congratulations: **you are already playing Dwarf Fortress**.  This is what the game is: sorting things, expanding, building things, solving problems and assigning jobs.  Everything from here on is simply a matter of expanding upon this basic foundation.  You'll have to keep your dwarves happy by building beds and bedrooms, learn how to farm and brew your own booze, and create useless stone trinkets that you can trade to gullible trade caravans in return for yak cheese.  You'll fail a lot, you'll have to consult the wiki hundreds of times, and Google is the best friend you'll have, but you'll have a great time doing it all.  Learning the game is an experience itself.

For now, try mining out some more areas, or making a refuse pile to see the dwarves clear up all those vermin corpses your cats have been leaving around.  Does this seem like the kind of game you'd like?  Then there's a whole world of things to learn and master.  It's tough, but it's more rewarding than any pick-up-and-play game you could imagine.

http://www.gamespot.com/news/ea-consumers-enjoying-and-embracing-microtransactions-6404525

When the idea of DLC and Microtransactions gets brought up it tends to bring with it a statement not unlike ""I expect to get a full game"". 

Now this concept doesn't really sit right with me. Dont get me wrong I am completely behind the concept of ""getting your moneys worth"". However once you start bringing in the idea of the ""full game"" then we start being bogged down in what is defined as ""the full game"". If I were to use an example.

Friend of mine on another forums argued that *Kasumi: stolen  memory* was part of the full game of ME2 and it was not an extra. Now if we were going by this objectively ME2 was designed to have Kasumi in from launch. Early footage from a game show (I cant for the life of me find the source of this) showed the game with 2 placeholders long before launch (one for Zaeed and one for Kasumi) long before the game was launch the game was designed with the idea in mind that these would be in the game. So the idea that ""They left them out"" holds water. This falls under Totalbisquit's argument of ""If they were making this stuff under development then I expect it to be part of the standard product"". Now this is not an unreasonable position. As a matter of fact is a logical and reasonable position. The problem however is that game production (and general production for that matter) doesn't really work confined into two neat boxes of before and after launch. How do you qualify stuff like episodic games designed to be sold to you in digestible chunks? What about concepts taken up during development, but dropped after a while when crunch time started showing. Then picked up again after release? What about kickstart goals that didn't make it? Those are pretty clear ideas that were on the board for development so they are part of the ""full game""?

Now to bring back my ME2 example. When I play games (with a singleplayer) I usually buy all the available DLC at the time of purchase. Then play it religiously for a week or so. And then leave it to reflect and never pick it up again. I bought ME2 one day one and more or less it went down like that. At no point in my experience did I go ""well something seems like it is missing"" so the concept of not having the ""full game"" was completely alien to me.

The definition is already very subjective and the water gets muddied even further when start talking F2P, Subscriptions, Games with procedural generated content ect. 

So I ask if we cannot set an universal standard for what a full game is and have to rely on ""I feel it is/isn't a full game"" then what value does it bring to discussion?

Perhaps I'm just ""played out"" for a while.  I don't want to blame work or family because I have certainly played around all of that!  Even looking at upcoming releases over the next few months... meh...

How about anyone else?  Are you in a gaming dryspell but still keep up with the community?

**EDIT**: Just a quick note -- No need to offer me advice on hobbies and things I should pick up.  It's not like there is a gaping hole in my life from the absence of video games, far from it.  I just find it interesting that I still keep up on gaming trends, upcoming releases, reviews, but I just don't feel like sitting down and playing one for more than an hour.

&gt;That's not the point, though, is it? I don't think we need to stop loving our past, &gt;but we need to stop enslaving ourselves and others to it. We... gamers, readers, &gt;people... need to demand better of our artisan classes.
&gt;It's around twenty years since I first played Mario, Zelda, and many other oft-&gt;revisited Nintendo properties. Twenty years of hardware developments, game &gt;mechanic maturation, and innovation.

&gt;This upsets me. I want the same wonder I had as a child of seeing something I'd &gt;never seen before... not the short-lived joy of seeing Link in a new iteration.
&gt;And for all the time we spend waxing poetic about Grim Fandango or Earthbound &gt;or Psychonauts, we keep buying Zelda rather than clutch onto our money tightly &gt;and demand things unseen before.
We do the same thing with Medal of Honor / Battlefield / Whatever FPS. We did the same thing to Final Fantasy. It's all the same behavior.
We need, as a group, to stop complaining about how boring the market gets and stop making ""the safe choice"" so safe for companies.
But that's just me and my opinion. Maybe it's worth it for the new generation or whatever. But me? I want better things for us all, not just for people to have my hand-me-downs with better graphics.

As something seeking to emulate the grand epic fantasy, story-telling should find ways to attach the equipment to the character.  After all, that equipment is part of who the character is and one cannot simply replace something so meaningful with something else just because the stats are higher.  You can see examples of this in Baldur's Gate and BG2; Boo, Xan's moonblade, Alyssa's ring, Edwin's necklace, etc. etc.  Those were generally inconsequential equipment slots, though.

Tabletop RPGs have a similar problem, but often not quite to the same extent (as games will often end before the piece is completely outdated, or equipment upgrades, or etc.).

In Dragon Age 2, there was an attempt to deal with this but it was not actually a well-handled system.  The characters that join your party have their equipment perma-locked and just upgrade stats and is dreadfully boring, all things told.

But then I played KOTOR and, more importantly, KOTOR 2.  While the games didn't take full advantage of what I'm seeing here, the seed of something possible has taken root in my mind.  KOTOR 2's upgrades are HUGE.  Mid game, upgrades are responsible for more power than the base equipment.  Customization of the upgrades allows the build you've worked towards for that specific character to be reflected in the equipment (DA2's great failing).  

Furthermore, if you truly build around customizing items instead of having it as an after thought, it means that you could still have 'other' equipment pieces.  Yes, Dashing_Rogue_04 has his custom made blaster-pistol / crossbow / whatever, but you could still equip the gigantic powerful base ranged item if you wanted to for any reason.

The trick here would be to have LOTS of options for item upgrades on the 'iconic' equipment and not as many (but definitely still some!) on the RARE (that part is important) other-equipment.  Sometimes you've got to assault a fortress head on and your silenced bolt-thrower isn't the right tool for the job, you know?

If you keep the instances of non-iconic equipment down, it also makes the game feel a bit less silly.  You're not lugging 20 suits of plate mail to the dude who has a shop in a village with 8 people, and then selling the lot of them to him.  And when you find something 'sort of worth using', it'll be designed for unusual and specific circumstances so you will consider hanging on to it for a long time ANYWAY.  You don't want to make these other-items TOO rare, though, especially if you're running with a blank-slate protagonist.  A pre-selected character for you (a la Final Fantasy, or DA2 again, or etc.) would be okay with it for the same reason the NPCs need it.  Blank-slates a la KOTOR (early on), Baldur's Gate, etc. need to be defined through player choice, and choosing out of a handful of options throughout the whole game would be very boring.  An unusually large selection to begin the game which quickly ramps down to ""normal"" may be a good direction to take that, though.

So now you make the itemization game all about the upgrades you find.  That's an easy order, once you've figured out your item system in general.

Note that this does not really apply to the ""third person looter"" types of games.  Borderlands or Diablo clones wouldn't work well with this, because those games focus on gameplay far more than they do characters, and the sheer change exhibited in a character build from start to finish is huge.

1342225474.0,187,self.truegaming,wizyn,Interesting squad/party mechanics from The Thing (2002) that never caught on with other developers.,Ranger33,237,50,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/wizyn/interesting_squadparty_mechanics_from_the_thing/,"The Thing is a third person shooter set in the aftermath of the original movie.  I was just randomly thinking about it today and remembered that it had some really cool elements.  The game is action heavy, but being based on a horror movie, it also has some interesting mechanics when it comes to the mental state of your squadmates.  There is a fear system and a trust system.  IIRC you can have 3 other guys with you, and they have classes like medic, engineer, and assault guy. The assault guy is better in a firefight, but the medic and engineer have special skills so it's important to keep them alive.

Since the game is survival-horror to some extent (in some parts you fight humans and this stuff applies less), weapons and ammunition are very limited.  Being the leader, you get to decide who gets the rifle, who gets the pistol, and occasionally, who goes empty handed.  This all ties into the game's trust system.  Giving someone a gun and ammo, healing them, killing aliens, shooting them up with some adrenaline, can all improve their state of mind and get them to trust you.  However, seeing corpses, denying them a weapon, fighting big crazy aliens can drive them mad, even to the point of suicide or attacking their teammates.  I even remember that they would notice if you didn't help in a firefight and complain about it.

Another element was that at any time one of them could be infected by the ""thing"" and secretly be an alien.  You had to watch for odd behavior and could do a limited number of blood tests.  You could also test yourself to make them trust you more.  If you tested someone who wasn't an alien, they would lose trust in you.

All of this (and more, I'm sure I forgot a few things) made for an incredibly intense atmosphere, where you had to carefully balance your limited resources and the mental state of your men, (not to mention your own, the game was plenty scary).  This added so much to the experience, giving you some meaningful interactions with your AI buddies.

I think modern games could really improve in the area of having the AI react to you and the environment, beyond spouting one-liners when you headshot someone.  Spec-Ops: The Line, does this a little, giving you some choices that change the flow of the story and reactions of your squad.  However, there are so many greater possibilities.  A few ideas that come to mind:  The AI notices that your hit percentage is low and makes fun of your aim.  If you target an enemy that is attacking one them, their morale goes up and they get an attack bonus for a while.  You can upgrade their gear along the way, deciding who gets a rocket launcher or body armor you found.  

Obviously, this extends beyond just shooters.  RPGs are usually good about having your group react to the choices you make, but rarely does that go beyond a little quip or some arbitrary number changing.  If you have a paladin type character in your group, and you do something truly evil, what if he didn't just whine about it, but actually broke from your party, attacking you or leaving and then hounding you throughout the rest of the game.

1368835423.0,183,self.truegaming,1ejtf4,Classification of RPG Battle Systems,zenosparadoxism,244,61,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1ejtf4/classification_of_rpg_battle_systems/,"I posted on /r/JRPG, but I realized this is probably a better place to start this discussion.

I have been interested lately in classifying battle systems across the very diverse world of RPGs. I was hoping to get some thoughts from you.

First, I started thinking about encounters. How do the battles start?

1. Scripted - Final Fantasy Tactics
2. Random - Pokemon, Final Fantasy 1-10, Star Ocean 1 &amp; 2
3. Active - Diablo, The Witcher, Mass Effect, Dark Cloud 2
4. Enemy on the map - [Grandia](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrK1MZoVVGg), Persona, Star Ocean 3 &amp; 4

Second, what is the ""flow"" of combat?

1. Real-time (i.e. characters act independently of one another)
2. Turn-based (i.e. typically involves committing to an action one character at a time)

There are games such as Valkyria Chronicles and Grandia that blur the line between the aforementioned flows of combat.

I feel that, in 99% of cases, a real-time battle system is easy to identify (feel free to disagree!). They come in several flavors (note this refers to the ""flow"" of combat and is a higher level concept than ""genres"" such as hack-n-slash, shooter, beat 'em up, etc):

1. Standard? - Diablo, Torchlight, The Witcher, Kingdom Hearts
2. [Pausable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-keeping_systems_in_games#Pausable_real-time) - Fallout 3, Vagrant Story, Secret of Mana, Dragon Age: Origins
3. [Linear Motion Battle System](http://www.giantbomb.com/linear-motion-battle-system/3015-219/) - ""Tales of"" games

Turn-based games are, in my opinion, much harder to classify. There are different ways of determining turn/execution order:

1. Random - Final Fantasy I ([explanation](http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/561981-final-fantasy-origins/54877608))
2. Phases - Wizardry ([explanation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-keeping_systems_in_games#Special_turns_and_phases))
3. ""Global"" unit order - Final Fantasy Tactics ([explanation](http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Charge_Time#Final_Fantasy_Tactics))
4. ""Local"" unit order (""We go, you go"") - XCOM: Enemy Unknown

Also, what about gameplay perspectives (interesting lecture [here](http://www.cis.cornell.edu/courses/cis3000/2011sp/lectures/15-Perspective.pdf))?

1. Axonometric (e.g. isometric, dimetric, 3/4 aka 2.5D, bird's eye, top-down, etc) - Diablo, Pokemon and *many* more...
2. 1st-person - Skyrim, Might &amp; Magic, Etrian Odyssey
3. 2nd-person (controlling the main character through the eyes of a peripheral character) - God of War 3, Super Mario 64 (not RPGs, I know, but this perspective is rare)
4. 3rd-person - Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, The Witcher, various MMORPGs

Frustration sets in for me with certain things specifically. Cheating gets me crazy especially in FPS. Botting, aim assists, boosting. I'm fine with losing a match fair and square. But when it's fixed, that kills me. 

so:

* is this a common thing? Do you do it even sometimes? What do you think is a ballpark percentage of people who do it sometimes?

* what causes it for you? Is it something specific or an overall emotion?

* Is Rage Quitting purely a player problem, or does the developer have something to do with it?

so I'm playing Bioshock 1 at last (only just got a decent computer). I haven't played any FPS since Half Life Episode 2, so I'd consider I'm going in to it relatively ""fresh"" in that I don't expect much in the way of mechanics comparatively.

However, I'm not enjoying the game so far. It feels so plodding, so scripted, with (compared to half life) bad combat. 

I want to mention two scenes in particular, using the same language:

""You're given X plasmid (is that the right term?), and you use it on X section of environment immediately after getting it to kill multiple enemies.""

Okay, all right, this is showing people how they work, it's a ""tutorial without a tutorial"", it's a ""quick time event without the quick"" or whatever you want to call it.

My thoughts were the following:

1) Was this considered annoying by people playing when it first came out?

2) (More interesting) Would it be possible for a game to have two or more 'modes', not 'difficulties' that would allow this frustration to be sidestepped? For example, I want a mode ""Normal difficulty but I don't need to have my hand held"". In this mode, you're not subjected to this quasi-tutorials; when you get new abilities you have to figure out yourself how to use them. And these environmental abuses of the abilities are sidestepped, either by reducing how obvious they are, or having the enemies not cluster around them waiting.

Would this be possible to implement in games? Have games implemented it beyond ""hard"" difficulty? 

Separately, I find the combat simultaneously sterile and brutal. Sterile in that you don't feel as though you're causing any damage to the enemies until they die, and brutal in that they'll charge right at you or stand on the stairs waiting for you to come close enough for you to shoot. Completely unlike Half Life where you'd flank and be flanked, where there were ranged weapons and you needed to think about dispatching large groups. Is it just a limitation of Rapture itself do you think? How is the claustrophobic world used to an advantage for gamers?

Sorry to ramble. It just bothers me that something I was so looking forward hasn't held its ground.

I should now note I have never read the book. When I say it was not successful I don’t mean as an adaptation but rather that it did not succeed at what it set out to do.

**Problem #1: too much story variance in all the wrong places**

The first thing you do is select your character from a list of mercenaries. On my play through I picked my favorite, which was a mistake. The character you choose becomes your character who is a full on Gordon Freeman blank slate. The ones you didn't pick, plus a couple women who weren't options (apparently it would have taken too much time to re-record every line about you with “she” and “her’) become the side characters in the game, their role specifically is randomized.

This is a bad idea. All of the characters have personality but not so much that they can not interchangeably serve any function in the story that everyone else does. Essentially they have no motivation or wants of their own but they have distinct affectations and quirks, all inhabiting a rainbow coalition of ethnic archetypes.

Then there’s you. You have a paragraph long back story, a job, and no dialogue. This is narratively detrimental to the plot of the game which hinges on you going through radical changes of personality and motivations that we are aware of only in so far as the mission blip on the map is telling us who we work for now.

So I pick my character (an Irish soccer hooligan) and in the opening scene you take a taxi cab to the home of “The Jackal”. “The Jackal” is an arms dealer who is evil because he is perpetuating a war by supporting both sides. Spoiler alert, the middle 19/20ths of this game are spent taking missions alternating from both sides of this conflict. 

You get to his apartment, pass out of malaria, get captured, and then the building you’re in blows up. This is an awesome way to open a game.

**Problem #2: 30 hours with no motivation**

So the story from that point until the last act is basically you take missions from the two competing sides in a civil war going on in the war torn African nation of… Africa. Your motivation for doing this is that there is a blip on your map telling you to. Neither side really says anything about helping you find The Jackal which is ostensibly why you stay in Africa. You do nothing to pursue him until you randomly happen upon him, so you must not care about finding him that much. Also, you have malaria, which is a pretty good reason to hightail it to a country with perhaps better medicine available. 

To make sure I had my facts right I periodically referred to the surprisingly extensive far cry 2 wiki, and the plot synopsis on the main far cry 2 page dedicates no shit 0 words to the section of the game after the tutorial but before the last 3 missions. This game is probably 30 hours long.

If you chose a side I guess we would infer you believe in and care about this conflict however you literally have to do missions for both sides. At no point during the game did I understand what the difference between the two sides was or why I was doing missions for them.

**Problem #3: Irish Soccer Hooligan Vs. The World**

The population of the African nation of Africa: .5% foreign mercenaries, .4% mission giving dictators, .1% civilians, 99% completely interchangeable re-spawning bad guys. You can’t even tell which side your opponents are on in the war. Every mission starts with the quest giver saying that this missions is very secret and as such his men will still kill you on sight if they see you just like they would anyone else. Ignoring the logic of them killing all unaligned people on sight, and the fact that after being briefed your companions immediately know exactly what your mission is without being told, Irish Soccer Hooligan is not Sam Fisser. My main weapons where one of those grenade machine guns like the demo man has and two things I never used because I had a grenade machine gun.

Far cry 2 is an open world that contains nothing but mooks who want to kill you immediately for ill defined reasons. [See this map?](http://farcry.wikia.com/wiki/Far_Cry_2_map) the yellow parts are where people don’t shoot you on sight (except the ones in the lower right corner). Those areas are still filled with interchangeable re-spawning bad guys, but you have to do something for them to attack you.

That said, the gameplay is pretty fun, and as you can tell by me making two 1000 word game analyses in two days I am currently a man with a lot of time. So I finished the game.

**Problem #4: 2 hours with terrible motivation.**

Near the end of the game you are re-introduced to The Jackal and my first reaction was “who the fuck is that?” because I had dropped the game for a month before coming back to it. His voice acting, for the record, is [terrible](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5FK0BALTCM) I like that voice actor when he is Max Payne so maybe it was bad direction. You see him once mid way through the game where he saves your life for ill defined reasons and then rambles like a homeless guy for a minute. Then he steals some diamonds from you and kicks you in the face until you pass out. Then the next time you see him he has had a change of heart maybe and is talking about saving the civilians (a mythical creature said to exist in this world) by killing all the bad guys. And a funny thing happens, he starts using words like “we’ and “us” to describe his mission, and according to the mission blips on my map, my only window into the psyche of Irish Soccer Hooligan, I agree with him. We are a team now. When he saves your life you’re incapacitated. When he steals your diamonds he has the drop on you. When you meet him in the prison you have all your guns and nothing is stopping you from killing him other that the hand of the developer. Killing this guy has been your only motivation for 28 hours and now you are apparently on his side.

During a mission to get The Jackal back the diamonds he stole from you (… okay… whatever) all of your buddies, almost all of which died on camera, turn out to have your diamonds, but are going to kill you. This might be out of character for them for all I know. You rekill all of your buddies, take the diamonds, bring them back to The Jackal (sure, why not) and he lays out his plan. He intends to blow up a bridge to prevent the soldiers from escaping and bribing the border patrol to allow all of the civilians (who apparently exist) to leave. He tells you one of you will blow up the bridge, and die in the process, and the other will take a briefcase full of diamonds to the border, give them to the border guard, and kill themselves. He let’s you choose.

Every RPG I've ever played has had a main storyline. Why is that, exactly? I understand when an RPG wants to tell a specific narrative. For Mass Effect, for example, it obviously makes sense. But for something like Elder Scrolls or Fallout 3/NV, it seems like they could easily do without a primary storyline. 

It seems to me that many people seem to assume RPG also means ""story game"" where the story is a major part of the game. While this is obviously true, I don't think an RPG has to tell a specific narrative. It can tell many. And most RPGs do, but they're mostly afterthoughts to the primary story.

I, personally, would love an RPG that is all ""secondary quests"". I've been the Chosen One and saved the world and rescued the princess enough times. I want to be whoever. I want to be dropped into the world as a nobody with no special destiny or quest, I don't want to stumble upon some legendary artifact. Most importantly, I don't want the world to treat me like I'm the only one that can solve their troubles. Why does every villager ask me to save their kid, or find their lots heirloom, or whatnot? I'm just some traveler as far as they know. And if it's a society where people all help each other out, why am I the only one that seems to be doing anything? I just want to be a blank slate that I can build from the ground up.

I feel like having this more freeform style of gameplay would be really conducive to sandbox games. I recall Fable, back when it was Project Ego was all about being able to do LITERALLY ANYTHING (classic Molyneux) but instead it was a fairly linear game that for the most part followed a straightforward story with a handful of side quests. It could have been so much more.

It seems like this especially pertains to the Elder Scrolls series. I have 100 hours in Skyrim and have not yet finished the main storyline. I probably played Morrowind for about 200 hours and never so much as touched it beyond delivering Caius Cascades his package. These games really don't need a main storyline, and I think they'd be better off ditching them and instead focusing on adding more ways to customize your character or at least your character's 'story' (what you do in the game) with more side quests and factions and whatnot.

Overall, it seems to me that having a primary story detracts from the 'role playing' in RPGs and limits the way in which you're shaping your character.",,False,,t5_2sgq6,False,,,True,t3_v0eqz,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/v0eqz/why_does_every_rpg_have_a_primary_queststoryline/,

I love multiplayer gaming anyway, though. Single-player games feel empty and lonely to me now (even excellent ones like Skyrim) and I really want to find my niche in online gaming.

I'm not just an MMO gamer, but the story is similar across other genres. I'm hopeless in shooters. I learned quickly to avoid MOBAs.    

What can I do? Where can a ""bad"" gamer go and still have a good time? Is there a genre or specific game where this type of culture is less prevalent? Or is there a way for me to cope with this in my current environment by changing my playstyle or mentality?

I am a little surprised because as many of you already know, there are plenty (or way too many) Japanese erotic games.  Obviously, the culture in Japan is very different; the Japanese does not seem to care too much about erotic games or erotic things in general.  

What I find surprising is that most of the games popular in the Western culture, they generally have at least a little bit of violence and blood.

If that is the case, then why is erotic video game such a taboo in the West?

Mainly because I don't consider myself very well spoken and ya know confidence issues and whatnot. Anyway to the point. Why isn't real death in video games more common? What I mean is, mainly, playable characters in RPGs that when killed cannot be revived. They're dead forever. Gone. I realize that there have been games which included real deaths before but I wonder why we don't see more of it. Sure there are casual gamers who'd be upset if their favorite character who they spent hours leveling died but I think there's just as many ""hardcore"" gamers that are looking for a challenge and would find the prospect of ""real death"" thrilling. I believe this ties in with discussions about morality choices and just overall more realism and immersion in video games. Players crave more choices, more opportunities, and more real consequences. When a character dies and you just throw a potion at them and they're fine again it comes off as pretty unrealistic even in a magical setting like most Final Fantasy games. I think there could be just as large of a market for a game with ""real death"" as for say Pokemon, which never die only faint. I think there could be clever ways to implement it too. Like when a character dies in battle you have so many hours to get them to a temple where priests bring them back to life or they're gone forever. So a safety net for casual gamers but the death is still there if you want it to be. Or maybe I'm just crazy I dunno. Anyway that's all I've got to say for now.

Usually I don't listen to music or let anything else distract me while I play either. I've read a few posts of people playing more hardcore which I've tried to do; saving only in town, traveling by foot/mount instead of fast travel and going out to find material for crafting instead of buying them from vendors often.

I cannot remember a game since 'Shadow of Rome' I believe, on the PS2, that has done anything quite near this.

I'd want to be part of a [ludus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludus_(ancient_Rome) where I'm nothing but a slave, training on a variety of different styles of fighting with different types of weaponry eg. maces, chain and ball, swords, two handed swords, trident, nets, shields, daggers, spears, and so on. Doing this would raise your stats and attributes in your trained field, and you would become more proficient in your combat style, raising the potential for inflicting deeper wounds on your enemies, striking faster, or crippling your enemies' limbs (once again depending on weapon of choice and style of combat).  

Here I think it's necessary to mention how I'd want the combat to be. 

I want to feel mortal, I don't want to go out into an arena - onto the bloodied sands, where my skill and strength will be tested - with a bare chest and not worry about the consequences. If I get stabbed in a vital artery, I should be praying that I can finish the fight, let alone living to see another day. Crushing blows that result in crippled arms and legs would take time to heal outside of the arena, and if that happened whilst you were fighting, you'd end up dropping your shield or weapon or limping due to a strike to your leg. The same should be for opponents, armour can only do so much, and striking where your enemy isn't armoured should be paramount to your success, helmets being knocked off and potentially chest plates, arm and leg armour being broken after repeated strikes would result in an opening which could allow for a killing blow. I think this could lead to visceral, tense battles - in the style of Dark Souls, knowing that the next attack your opponent makes may be the last thing you ever see. 
 
I would be contented with a standard character creation system providing the combat system was well focused upon, as stated above. Some perks (perhaps, not exactly necessary) or attributes may be useful to allow players get on their feet at the beginning of the game, but most importantly, I think their should be one and only one goal. 

To fight for your freedom.

You represent your ludus, and as you win fights you gain reputation. You start off at a fairly poor ludus and as you win fights you get sold to bigger, more reputable schools and, in turn, fighting in grander arenas with better quality weapons of a diverse range. Eventually, as you got to the end game, you would fight multiple opponents and (perhaps) people on chariots or (more realistically) other skilled gladiators who are more heavily armoured than yourself with better weaponry. Once you've defeated all the game has to offer (I'm thinking a fair few fights, but that's up to the creators of the game if there ever *is* a creator of the game) you have a choice, to retire with your freedom (some sort of ending cutscene with your gladiator's statistics readily available at a character history screen or something) or to fight until you die on the sands, a warrior's death (the same as before, different cutscene and so on). 

I don't know, maybe it's just me and my obsession with gladiator combat, but I'd play the ever-loving shit out of this if it was made. What would you like to see?

You would control your main character in a 3rd person camera format. Story isn't as important as gameplay mechanics here for me. The character would have small array of firearms, such as smaller laser pistols to rifles etc. Somewhat of a control system like in Red Dead Redemption.

Here's where the main point of the gameplay is. You'd have control of a large space vessel. One you could pick out, or buy. So long as you are piloting it, you'd have full control of where you wanted it to go, or you could put the ship into auto pilot and freely roam the ship, speak with your team, or stop the ship and take a small fighter ship/shuttle off of the main ship. 

The large ship could be taken to planets where you could actually land the ship, you'd have maps to guide you but for the most part there'd be exploration of unknown rocks and moons, planets etc. It should also be possible to take your character out of the ship for space walks and repairs to the ship. 

There'd also be a large planet exploration aspect on foot, or with vehicles. All of which should be buyable and upgradable from a 'main' large city where you could buy most things, or some from smaller venues. As well as hiring people for the ship.

Even if you make the system more interesting by causing reactions of spells and mishaps [read: rogue trader], it's still, ""Okay, I'm gonna pick the spells Sleep, [Obligatory attack], and light.""  It feels like from that point on the spell system in and of itself is limited to the mundane, being totally understandable.

Instead, I'd like to create a spell system that new wizards must research on their own. They start out with 3 spell words in some made up language. Say Chool, Mas, and Bari. Chool is standard damage spell. Mas is a utility spell of say lifting or something. Bari is a standard light spell. Now comes the interesting part. What happens if a player tries to mix the two? Chool Bari might be a light harm spell, which would mean higher damage to undead, shades, etc but lower damage to things that don't fall in those categories. 

Now, at no time do I let the player know exactly what the system means. They have to figure it out, just like a wizard would in a good fantasy setting. They could meet professionals who would teach them for money, or find books which go into some detail (Although neither source would understand entirely the possibilities of the magic. Even our most venerable scientists are learning stuff about things we thought we were doing good in 50 years ago.)

An added event to this new system would be disarming magical traps. Even your common rogue (if they had a feat for reading magical text) would learn the importance of some common trap words (Like bon for sealing, marn for fire). So when the players come across a chest and it's decorated in ornate writing saying  chool bon marn, the rogue could reduce damage by properly disarming the words with a chemical or element used in enchanting (Like 4e residuum). Each word would have a cost to disarm, just like it has a cost to arm.

I might even go so far as creating a heirarchy of words (Making an actual dispelling system), so one would have to disarm traps by disarming words in an order, or some words being capable of overriding other words. Going back to the trap concept, those words being basic words, one could be replaced by a Medium word (Like llor, which would enchant the bounty of a chest, effectively replacing the items inside with gold at a slight loss to their value for easy transportation.)

1354786005.0,177,self.truegaming,14dkpu,Refusal of the Call in Open World games,jmarquiso,228,51,207,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/14dkpu/refusal_of_the_call_in_open_world_games/,"Over on /r/Games, someone posted a bit about how Far Cry 3 is boring unless you treat it as a shooter and stick with the main quest, not worrying about too many sidequests.  I haven't played Far Cry 3, but it got me thinking about open world games (particularly TES games) that have little to no consequence for not following the main narrative.  I wrote this:

I honestly don't understand the ""open world"" mentality of ignoring the main quest - especially if there's a sense of urgency involved. I understand the novelty of it sure. However, I think some of these games could be better served with a ""refusal of the call"" sort of scene.

This is what I mean - in the usual Heroic Journey (not just Joseph Campbell, but Aristotle talks about this as well), when a character is offered a heroic quest, there's a period of inaction in which the Hero doesn't want to go. Then there's a scene that brings them right back in. It's a moment that could happen quickly or after a long period of time (there have been whole movies based on the ""refusal of the call"") - like Luke Skywalker's refusal and need to go back to his uncle's farm, only to find them dead and killed by the Empire pulling them back in. Or as quickly as [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbdFG_C3zN0). 

If Link never accepts his quest, then some other hero is out there. But Link can't not accept the quest. What if it were the same for open world games? In Far Cry 3 (I am going off information I learned - I haven't played) you escape the pirates, but then your friends are all spread out among them. It's understandable that certain people - especially where Jason is at the start, as someone who isn't a killer - would be too scared or cowardly to go and directly after them. So add a scene where - in hunting - he finds the recently dead corpse of one of his bros, or more open world-y - he finds himself stalked by pirates unless he frees the area. That you can't just ""go out and do whatever you want"" without consequence. This was actually one of my problems with Oblivion, and Fallout 3. That there was a main quest but there was no consequence if I waited it out or didn't pursue. It'd always be waiting there for me.

Don't get me wrong - I LOVE open world games - Just Cause 2, Morrowind, Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas are among my favorites. Earlier open world games managed to handle these in such ways to nudge - not force - someone toward the main quest. Star Control 2, Fallout,and Fallout 2 had schedules that you had to keep. If you veered too far away, you'd ""lose"". You'd still be able to play the game (Star Control 2 has an excellent sequence where the big evil ""wins"" and slowly starts tearing down all the spheres of influence of all the races you've met - while you're still exploring), but you see the consequences of inaction.
Oh, I know Open World games are about freedom and shouldn't be grounded in normal narrative rules, etc. etc. etc. However this sort of structure could also be beneficial as well as offer more challenge. A schedule (a la Fallout) means you have to complete within a certain amount of time. The sense of urgency adds to the ludic nature of the game.

You have to admit, it's a better scene than ""boring, I might as well go save my friends now,"" as you described here.""

---

Now I'm wondering what /r/truegaming thinks.  While not Open World, Deus Ex: Human Revolution had a great version of this where - waiting too long to do a job had a bomb explode.  All while Sarif is urgently trying to get you to a helicopter.

Further, I like the idea that TES games are whole worlds that you can just explore, ignoring the main questline.  It's been the franchise's signature since inception.   However I'd like to see a world where ignoring the main questline has consequences.  The evil is slowly growing if you do nothing, or the hero they sent instead died, so they came to you again (and it's your brother!), or a your little sister is picked by a lottery so she will die if you don't go in her stead (I know, I know).   You have to be willing to accept the consequences of inaction.

Now I would argue that this is the definition of agency.  Action AND inaction should have consequences.  You can still ""play the way you want to play"", but for the world to be believable, you can't just expect things to happen at your convenience.

Though this still reminds me of old adventure games where if you step in a place ""off the map"", they'd have some creature just kill you as soon as you enter.

For my graduation thesis, I am looking at how religion is portrayed in Japanese videogames.

Religion in Japan is quite fascinating. From my experience, most Japanese people live their lives in an ambivalent state between the extremes of religion and atheism. Their 'religion' (if it can be called that) consists mostly of social obligations such as yearly shine visits and superstition such as charms. Most Japanese people will not identify as Atheist if asked (saying either ""Shinto"" or ""Buddhist"") but few care about any actual myths, belief systems, or teachings of these traditions.

I believe that Japanese games are both a product of this environment and help maintain it. Japanese games often feature religious figures as antagonists (Bayonetta, Shin Megami Tensei), take healthy liberties with character designs and plot (El Shaddai), or insert dirty jokes into religious myths (Okami)

What other examples can you think of religion in Japanese games? It is a topic I very interested in and would like to discuss. (Also it would really help me with my paper!)

I've been a nintendo man since my first memories; I'm a 19 year old kid, and the first controller I ever picked up was duck hunt. This quickly changed when the 360 came out, and most of my friends dismissed the Wii. I was alright with that for a while, but with no one to play with, I jumped ship too. Played a 360 for a while, and it was pretty fun, I've got to say. I don't think there's a set of games I enjoyed more than Red Dead Redemption and Fallout: New Vegas, but I was quickly proved wrong by Deus Ex: Human Revolution and Mirror's Edge. I've been around the entire spectrum of gaming, from RTS (Age of Empires, Starcraft) to shooters (CoD4: Modern Warfare, Battlefield 1943) to the classic nintendo games (Super Mario Galaxy, Zelda, Metroid Prime) to the sandboxes. There are too many to count.

I stood up and walked away from the console. I came back the next day, and tried a few old games; nothing. not even a little tingle of dopamine when I'd beat something. I sat there and beat RDR: Undead Nightmare again, and nothing. I started a new character in Skyrim, and nothing. I went to gamestop, traded in games I never wanted to play again and picked up Skyward Sword, and I thought I was just missing the nintendo touch.

Nothing. Two hours after the first dungeon, I found myself feeling numb and indifferent. It was the new game from a series I've loved since my childhood, and it felt like nothing.

My last resort was to trade it in and pick up Saints Row The Third, a game I considered so wacky and batshit insane that I had to love it, but I went numb even quicker than with SS. I'm sitting here with 19 years of gaming history in front of me, and I wonder if all that time has been a waste. Gaming has been a huge part of my life ever since I was born, and now I feel ready to toss it aside like it was nothing. That frightens me.

I haven't picked up a game in days. I tried it again and I felt like I was force-feeding myself. Every time I think about it, I get a thousand yard stare as I try to convince myself how much fun it is.

We also talk about other media with similar issues, from Dances with Wolves to Gran Torino.

My response to the thread is below, and it talks about my experience LARPing period accurate racism, and a bit about the TV Series Deadwood, Bioshock: Infinite, GTA San Andreas and TWD.  It's long, so I apologize ahead of time.

The **TL;DR** I found is that one should make characters well rounded over ""that racist guy"" and ""that racial trope"".  And that it's a problem across media, not just gaming.  

---

I would argue this problem isn’t endemic to games, but most media in general.  

First - my background.

This is a hard one for me, since I try to take a nuanced view of it.  First, full disclosure.  I’m half asian, half white.  I grew up in white middle class neighborhoods in the US and therefore am pretty privileged.  I have both white and asian family who are not as privileged.  The white half of my family is southern, (Mississippi actually), and I even have some Klan members in my family history.  The other half has been members of everything from the AFW movement to certain asian foreign armies (though historically on the US’s side).  I’m no stranger to racism, even having confrontations with certain skinheads. I'm lucky to not have severe repurcussions because of the color I've been born in.   

I’ve also studied it heavily, speciifically Orientalism and Imperialist history in asian and european countries.  One area of concentrated study was early 20th and late 19th century.  

Now a story.

Back in college I joined a LARP group and we had quite a few vampire games.  Two that I participated in had race involved.  

The first was a **Vampire LARP** set in NYC at the turn of the 19th/20th century.  The idea was that the Camarilla (the ""civilized"" guys) are going to have their first major battle with the newer, crazier Sabbat (The ""uncivilized"" guys).  We were basically going to roleplay the fall of New York.

It was one of the best and intense (gaming) experiences of my life.  The character I was given was an Eastern European born immigrant as well as Tremere Primogen.  I asked the Storytellers if my character faced immigrant discrimination, and they said to run with it.  I also mentioned that the Tremere were shown to be both racist and sexist and this is a time where that was more the norm - and whether it would be okay to roleplay.  They said to make sure it was okay with those I was roleplaying with.  Now, these are a large group of friends and we all know eachother inside and outside of game.  They know me and my feelings on these things, and they frankly believed I'd be more sensitive to these issues.

I solved two of the central mysteries by playing racist and sexist.  Two Native American Gangrel showed up, and people thought I was metagaming as my character immediately made them suspect because - well - they were natives.  Which meant they had to be turned by more savage.  I then began interrogating them by asking about tribes and their rituals (Tremere are mages and very interested in mysticism) which - on its face is definitively racist.  Again they thought I was metagaming and I explained to the STs that I was just playing the character straight, and making assumptions about these Gangrel as they're part of an out group.  Finally, I had an ""assistant"" Tremere who was female, and I kept sending around doing menial tasks.  Right in the Tremere clan book, it refers to them as notoriously sexist, especially early on.  So I was making her jump through hoops to even get an audience with me.  

Turned out, all three of these characters were *the* Sabbat infiltrators, with the STs counting on liberal sensibilities by subverting the ""noble savage"" trope and ""seductive female"" trope.  My character was merely suspicious of members of the outgroup.  They had to pull a Deus Ex Machina to kill my character as it was necessary for the fall of New York.  That said again - we were all a group ffo friends who all knew one another.  And I was frank with everyone out of character and asked if it was ok.  I managed to roleplay without slurs, with the exception of at one point saying 'savages"".  (Edit) Playing racist somehow *helped* me solve the game as the STs used both gender and race to hide them to players with more modern sensibilities.

The next was one I created based in a **Steam Punk Wild West.**  We have a multi-racial group, and I decided to make a race an actual mechanic.  A ""detriment"" was ""discriminated race/group"" - which included asians, african-americans, native americans, germans, irish, and mormons.  This was an odd choice and made many uncomfortable - particularly the people of color that portrayed some of them (I did have some caucasians want to play non-caucasians and vice versa mind you).  I gave two characters a perk ""From the future"" and they were the most interesting - they allowed the systemic racism to bother them and fit into their roles.  The PoC character from the future snapped at the population as uncivilzed savaages, while the non-POC character felt guilty for enjoying the benefits. 

I should reiterate - this was amongst a group of friends who ALREADY KNEW one another. When it came down to it, poeple were simply uncomfortable with directly participating in racism, even if it was ""just"" play.  So it was something that we dropped later.

**Bioshock: Infinite** has been mentioned several times, and I think it's important to talk about.  As something that was meant to examine systemic racism, it feels sa it gets away with just paying lipservice to it.  The early ""stoning"" with baseballs recalls current theocratic societies, while imagery reflects early Mormonism, and then there's really odd looks at conflating racism with the labor movement.  Not to mention having some progressive stances toward feminism (there are female enemies, presumably at high levels).

I think - and I've said before - it misses a few things.  While it's true that the Woman's Suffrage movement specifically ignored the plight of women of color, it is also true that the Labor movement specifically scapegoated race and was - itself - one of the causes of race riots around this time.  Also, American Exceptionalism wasn't the belief that American Whites were somehow superior - that was part of it - it was that Americans - an empire birthed out of the oppression of another empire - are in a place to bring freedom and civilzation, and redefined Imperialism of the time.  You see - The States was trying to find a way to hold two conflicting ideas.  One that the States was born out of an oppressive regime and stands for freedom, and Two that the States whould be allowed to expand and create their own colonies.  The ""Exceptionalism"" aspect of this was that somehow America was allowed to expand as they understood how to free people.  And that the uncivilized didn't know/deserve to free themselves.  Hence, we ""bring democracy"" to the Philippines, to the Western Territories, to Alaska, and the rest.  In other words, without the guiding hand of American Democracy, they'd devolve into a riot of a revolution, you know, like the Vox Populi eventually *does*.

I think there's something interesting to be said for **GTA: San Andreas**.  Somehow in Rockstar's ""writing by parody of existing media"" they ended up telling an interesting story about race (except with our blind chinese guy Wu ""Woozie"" Si).  Most oddly, it's a period piece about the early 90's, the rise of hip hop gangsta movies, and most importantly the '92 Rodney King Riots.

Only instead of 4 white guys who beat up Rodney King, it's the acquittal of a dirty *black* cop played by Sam Jackson that leads to the riots.  This is a different trope altogether arising from fiction trying hard not to be racist - the *good ones* vs. the *bad ones*.  That is you get the good asian guy that represents american western values to go up against the evil triad gangs.  It's you get the African American gang member trying to reform to take on evil authority represented by an African American.  It isn't racism CJ is fighting, it's abuse of authority.

I think it's important not to forget the past, and to understand where things are.

I think the most interesting version of this in other media is probably **Deadwood**.  Deadwood is about despicable people in a despicable town in a despicable time.  It still has an interesting cast, but I'd call attention to Mr. Wu.  Wu is the Swearengen of Deadwood's Chinatown, but still lower than Swearengen in the grand scheme of things.  He's a sort of Godfather figure.  He never speaks an intelligible word of English, but keeps his people fed and surviving through deals with the big man in town all the time.  The thing is - this exists for many immigrant populations, and the Chinese are not an exception.  Today, this gets stereotyped as Triads and Tongs - but those are far more recent than this.  The issue is that the law and government can't be trusted to handle problems in these communities, so they govern themselves.  Wu is one such leader.  He's a nuanced version of a racist stereotype, with his own concerns and definitely a cause for concern in the narrative.  You can see him seething from all the racism lumped in his direction as well.  But it's how he and his community have learned to live within and without the systemic racism of the time.

And that's how it needs to be done.  With nuance and understanding that characters - even racist characters or characters of an oppressed race.  They aren't ""noble savages,"" or (with apologies) ""magic negroes"".  They're fully fledged characters.

For example, Lee Everett in **The Walking Dead** encounters some racism without calling too much attention to it.  And we get a good joke out of it as well.  ""You know, urban?""  It's merely a fact of life that Lee is used to dealing with, growing up in the American South.  It's yet another obstacle he has to overcome with allies he needs to make to survive.

Edit: The issue is expecting people to roleplay that setting, to actively take part in it against their own modern values.

Edit 2: Formatting and clarity

I know there have been some truly heartbreaking moments in certain games, as beloved characters meet their tragic ends (*FFVII*) or it becomes known that friends or lovers must necessarily be separated (*Kingdom Hearts*).  It takes a certain risk on the part of the developer to create a game with such elements, because the whole point is to upset the player, which usually isn't the intended purpose of the game itself.

The article presents a theory of psychology that individuals are motivated by either performance or mastery (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_theory#Mastery.2Fperformance). ""It turns out there are two different ways people respond to challenges. Some people see them as opportunities to perform - to demonstrate their talent or intellect. Others see them as opportunities to master - to improve their skill or knowledge.""

The author then claims that RPGs tend to reward players for ""fake"" achievements, or accomplishments that do not require the player to actually overcome any challenge, only invest time. While action games demand that the player actually improve their own skill in order to progress.

Thus RPGs promote and increase the performance-based motivation, whereas action games promote a better, mastery-oriented mindset. These reward systems have an impact in all of our life pursuits, and so we should be mindful of which tendencies we are fostering.",,False,,t5_2sgq6,1370012242.0,,,True,t3_1fekw7,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1fekw7/awesome_by_proxy_addicted_to_fake_achievement/,

In GTA, (IV specifically being the most recent) when you got a certain amount of stars, police would come after you with increasing difficultly to get away from obviously. The area about which they'd search for you grew larger with each star and eventually SWAT and FIB guys would get after you. And that level was always on you and it didn't matter what you did, they'd eventually find you if you stood in the same place long enough.

I just wanted to talk about the effort that development teams put in to these kinds of mechanics.

Driver 3 (as old and mostly bad as that game was) had some good ideas as far as police detection goes. There was a wanted level attributed to the car you were driving as well as yourself, and if you never got out of the car, or they never saw your face, you didn't have a wanted level on your person so when you were out of line of sight, you could get out of the car and not have a wanted level. But, like in real life, the car you were driving instantly had a level on it that no matter where you were and drew attention from police and it always was there on just that car you committed crimes in.  GTA 4 only had wanted level on your person, and it made it seem like it didn't matter what car you were in, they'd find you anyway. (Albeit changing cars mid chase reduces the distance to which they'd detect you but still)

What about other games? The overarching idea here is that there is a certain threshold that has to be crossed for you to enter into a 'I'm in danger and detected by the enemy' that makes it interesting and encourages you to not (or to get caught) doing bad things depending on wether you wanted a fight or not.

What are some games that have done this well? Splinter Cell maybe? Hiding in the dark was a way to not get shot, but it seemed overly cheesy when you could basically hide in plain sight as long as it was dark and it didn't matter.

Just wanted to know what you guys think about how important of a mechanic this is is all",,False,,t5_2sgq6,False,,,True,t3_1e2kgb,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1e2kgb/thoughts_on_gta_and_police_awareness_and_enemy/,

Unfortunately there seems to be little variety in terms of ways that this can happen; if you're playing an RPG like Skyrim, 90% of the time you'll be using a sword, axe, or bow. If you're playing a modern shooter, 99% of the time you'll be using some form of automatic weapon. I'm generalizing of course, but there has got to be a way to introduce variety to these increasingly bland methods of destruction.


I believe there are two ways to go about this, the first (and easiest) being to create some interesting twist to ""standard"" weapons. I think Prey did an excellent job with this; nearly all your weapons are literally alive, pulsing with organic material. Your grenades are actual crab monsters that you lob at enemies after ripping their little legs off.


The second approach is to create entire new weapon designs; Dead Space was a pioneer in this regard. Although you had the staple assault rifle, pistol, flamethrower, etc., the most unique weapon to me was the saw gun; a weapon that shoots and suspends a spinning saw blade which you have to carefully align with the target to shred them to pieces.

So what games have you encountered that have ""revolutionized"" weapons combat in their own way? And are there any other ways that we can add variety to the increasingly boring set of weapons that now dominate most games?

**TL;DR** Weapons are starting to get boring, how can we make them cooler/better/add more variety? Which games have done a good job of this?

**EDIT** It sounds like a lot of people are answering the first question with regards to guns, but I don't see many answers regarding melee weapons. Any thoughts? I'm thinking mostly of Skyrim in comparison to Morrowind; why has the variety of weapons decreased? In Skyrim you're limited to broadswords, whereas in Morrowind you can have longswords, shortswords, scimitars, sabers, etc. I would be interested to see a game with some of the unique melee/non-gunpowder weapons that exist in the world, such as halberds, guisarmes, kusari-gama, twin hooks, etc. Is the problem simply that this is too much animation to handle, and the physics would be completely different?",,False,,t5_2sgq6,1354813666.0,,,True,t3_14csxo,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/14csxo/how_do_we_make_weapons_more_interesting/,
1340682943.0,178,self.truegaming,vm1ja,"What's your opinion about handicap (a.k.a. ""Mario Kart effect"") in racing games?",quantumsuicide,237,59,170,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/vm1ja/whats_your_opinion_about_handicap_aka_mario_kart/,"Every once in a while, I'll invite a couple of friends over and we'll play [Blur](http://store.steampowered.com/app/42640/) together (great party game btw). When we do, I always enable handicap, which means that people in front will go slower than people in the back (or something to that effect).

Here's why. I personally believe it makes the game fairer and more fun. Since there is usually a copious volume of ethanol consumed throughout the evening, our reflexes tend to be a bit off. With the handicap on, even if you accidentally take a wrong turn and end up in last place, you still have a chance at a comeback and finishing on the podium. It also prevents the CPU opponents from getting too far away, which means that there will be more action and missiles fired and stuff.

But, inevitably, at some point, one of my friends will look in the game settings and realize that the handicap is on. Ironically, it's usually whoever's on a losing streak, and they will throw a tantrum about it. They say it's unfair because it adds too big an element of chance in the game and doesn't leave place to real talent. They say whoever wins is probably who got the best powerups towards the end of the race, which I admit is true.

So when they throw a fit about handicap, I turn it off, and then proceed to obliterate everybody in all the races (since I played that game a lot more than anybody else). Is it more fun if I spend the entire race in first position without letting anybody catch up to me? Is it more fun if I don't get hit with a single weapon the entire time because I'm half a lap in advance? They'll usually say yes.

I don't get it. I try to be fair for everybody but some of them seem to prefer losing constantly over getting a boost when they fall too far behind.

So I wonder, fellow gamers, what's your opinion on handicap in racing games? It's enabled in pretty much every racing game's single player mode, but usually optional or disabled in multiplayer.

1339504402.0,175,self.truegaming,uxu1v,Gamespot editor Tom McShae missed a rare opportunity to discuss soft propaganda and  narrative realism,,228,53,84,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/uxu1v/gamespot_editor_tom_mcshae_missed_a_rare/,"This thread is in reference to [this Gamespot video](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/uxbc9/gamespot_editor_argues_with_moh_warfighter/), posted and subsequently voted to the front page of /r/games. 

To condense the 22-minute video to its essentials: Tom McShae harangues EA executive Greg Goodrich for the alleged dissonance between Medal of Honor: Warfighter's gameplay and the realism purported by its advertising campaign. McShae's argument centers on features that he deems unrealistic, including regenerating health, temporary deaths and the like. 

I'm not here to discuss the veracity of the Gamespot editor's point, though I'll say that I disagree with most of his argumentation. Rather, I'd like to explore the more discreet, yet incomparably important point which seems to have escaped Mr. McShae's attention: 

**Medal of Honor: Warfighter isn't unrealistic because of regenerating health. The game is unrealistic because it offers a completely skewed, almost offensive and certainly propagandizing narrative of recent political events.** 

I should mention here that I played and reviewed Medal of Honor 2010 for a prolific gaming website. And upon testing the game, it wasn't respawn buttons that bothered me, but the jingoistic retelling of the War in Afghanistan. When EA exclaimed that the MOH reboot would be realistic and respectful of the modern polity, I expected a sober look at a war which few support and even fewer understand. What a fool I was. 

Instead, I played witness to perhaps the most intentionally inaccurate summary of the Invasion of Afghanistan. MOH 2010 seemed to be cut from the same psy-op cloth that bore fruit to names like 'Operation Enduring Freedom.' The game heartlessly dehumanized Afghanis and threw itself--without hesitation or doubt--at the altar of American patriotism. 

Sure, the rote facts were largely accurate. From the 2008 surge in Kapisa Province to the surgical missions against well-placed Mullahs, the dates and locations were all well-researched. 

But what about the Shinwar massacre? What about the warlordism, banditry and opium production which soared with U.S. consent? What about the countless victims, refugees and orphans created by an American war of aggression? 

In the end, Medal of Honor felt indescribably one-sided, like an editorial ripped out of Stars and Stripes. 

Most other war games, regardless of which war in particular, try to inject context to improve the overall experience of the story. In Modern Warfare 1, you were witness to summary executions at the hands of Al-Asad's troops. Heck, even World at War gave you the option of killing unarmed German soldiers, simply to give you a role in the escalating hatred felt on all sides. 

When I heard the new Medal of Honor was going to be realistic, I expected those kinds of moments, only applied to a modern conflict. Quite the contrary, the game held onto the ""They hate us for our freedom"" rhetoric and used it to justify my destruction of villages and their inhabitants. 

As a non-American, I felt excluded. 

As a student of political history, I felt manipulated. 

And as a Somali, I'm poised to feel utterly insulted by the upcoming Medal of Honor: Warfighter, which promises to bring the fight to the evil, unrepentant pirates of Somalia (who, upon closer inspection, are actually victims of European energy conglomerates, the destablizing influence of the American War on Terror and foreign fishermen). 

Is EA trying to inculcate its players with pro-America messaging? Probably not. But the fact that the developer has worked closely with (and have standing charitable arrangements for) the Pentagon is easily evident. You won't find a single anti-war sentiment in this game; EA's military partners have ensured that.

But maybe I'm holding the game to an unfair standard. Forgive me, but I hope that video games can become more than mindless fun, and that includes first-person shooters. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**A COUNTER-ARGUMENT:** 

The case could be made that game's are meant to be fun, first and foremost. You could argue that companies like EA and Danger Close have no inherent responsibility to educate their customers--schools and libraries fill those duties. 

And I'm with you thus far. 

But then why advertise your game as 'realistic?' It certainly isn't the gameplay mechanics which warrant the auspicious identifier; after all, the shooting is rudimentary, the ally AI is unimpressive and many of the game's most lauded scenes are scripted QTEs. 

This would lead an inquiring mind to assume its the narrative experience, not the gameplay which must be realistic, right? RIGHT? 

Medal of Honor: Warfighter isn't out yet, so I'll reserve my judgment for now. But if EA's 2010 effort to create realism was any indication, the company will fail tragically in that respect. 

If going to stupefying lengths to white-wash the global War of Terror counts as realistic, than their definition of 'reality' may be based on the Fox News evening report.

i'm 30 years old, and I love play online games. I played over 4 years of World of Warcraft and I'm currently enjoying League of Legends, and I started noticing that I don'r run into other players around my age.

So the first question that popped into my mind was:

Why?

Well, if you ever played any online game for over a month you probably noticed how immature and childish most of the players can be. So I guess other people around my age just don't have the patience to deal with this.

Me, I'm a social creature, I love people and I love to make new friends. But I realized that I, too, don't have patience to deal with kids online. 

What I noticed about myself is that as I grow older, the easier it is for me to ignore toxic players on said games. I just don't waste my time arguing with them, and plain and simple ignore all the crap they throw at me and proceed to play my game. I even apologize oftenly for my mistakes.

I do take online games seriously: I study them, I train to perform my best and I don't mess around during the game. But I just seem to not get mad at toxic attitudes anymore. I just shrug it off as immaturity and tell myself that it's not my place to scold them. And I do think this is because of my age.

See, I think I learned that a game is just a game, and altough it's fun to win and/or crush your opponents even, in the end it's the experience you had that matters. I had tons of lost matches in League that I considered my best matches.

So I see those people who are probably younger than me raging because of a simple mistake, and calling everyone else names and I... meh.. I think I'm past that. I just realized that arguing with everyone won't make my experience as a whole better, and certainly won't make my teammates better players.

So I come to you and ask:

Did any of you had similar experience? Even if you're not older, but did you actually learn how to enjoy an online game despite toxic attitudes? And when you run into a toxic player, does it get to you? What do you think about this theory that when you get older, it's easier for you to deal with this kind of attitude?

1364255567.0,169,self.truegaming,1b0ajj,"With Bioshock Infinite Coming Out in a Mere Few Hours, Can We Talk About What Made the First Bioshock Game So Great?",,301,132,133,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1b0ajj/with_bioshock_infinite_coming_out_in_a_mere_few/,"Let me preface this by saying that I'm not trolling in any sense of the word, I would like a genuine discussion about what made the first Bioshock so revered.

Ok, flameshield's up, here goes...

I didn't like Bioshock.

Let me explain why.  I suppose a part of it could be because of the immeasurable hype that surrounds the game.  I played it a few short months ago, so by that time I'd heard all about how it's ""the #1 example of art in games"" and one of the greatest games ever made.  But honestly?  I don't think I'd even place it in my favourite games from the current console generation.

Don't get me wrong, the atmosphere of that game is amazing.  Rapture is an incredible world to explore, and Irrational Games did a great job creating a believable world.  However, beyond that I don't have much to say about Bioshock.  I frequently hear people cite the game's story as one of the best in any video game.  But really, I didn't think there was much to it.  It's supposedly a commentary on objectivism, but I don't really see it.  It didn't seem like a commentary on objectivism so much as a game with a universe in which objectivism *exists*.  Sure, Andrew Ryan's created a city where man is not restrained by anyone else, but this objectivism never really concerns the player.  You just enter Rapture and the game immediately tells you ""oh no, look what happened to this city run by an objectivist, ok now go kill this guy"".  Then the rest of the game involves fetch quests!  I seriously think every single level had you collecting a bunch of stuff to build something.  How is this compelling gameplay?  I don't get it.

I guess I should comment on the famous [twist](/spoiler) as well.  [The twist midway through Bioshock is admittedly quite ingenious.  I get how it's a commentary on games that's unprecedented.  However, in my eyes one twist does not make a game worthy of such praise.  After the twist happened, the game kind of ran out of steam, and I had to force myself to keep playing.](/spoiler)

I don't want to say anything about the gameplay, because I think it's pretty much universally agreed that Bioshock's gameplay was never the game's strong point.

And that's pretty much all I have to say about Bioshock.  Looking at videos of Bioshock Infinite in action, I'm admittedly getting pretty excited, so hopefully Infinite turns me back onto the series (I haven't played Bioshock 2, and I don't really plan to considering what I've heard about it).

What do you guys think?  Did Bioshock deserve all the praise it got?  Why/why not?  If there's one thing I'd like to ask, it's that everyone please keeps this a discussion where downvoting isn't used because someone disagrees with you.  I had to think seriously about posting my opinion here because lots of people probably think I'm full of shit, and if I am, please tell me!  I *want* to hear why I'm wrong and this game is great.  But the last thing I want to see is this post getting downvoted into oblivion without anyone explaining to me why I'm wrong.

We don't have these messages very often (and that's probably a good thing) but I think it's time for another one. There's a few things I'd like to mention and remind everyone about, and then I'll be around answering questions for some of the day afterwards.

First off, I'd like to point out what a pleasure it is to moderate this subreddit. Not only are reports pretty accurate, but we get modmail frequently letting us know about offending posts really quickly. It's always a pleasure to read through the threads I come across on here, and it's rare that I'll see big name calling fights break out (they do happen, and get removed when they're seen). On that topic, if you see posts or comments which are intended to offend, or are inappropriate for Truegaming, please don't hesitate to hit that report button. The moderators aren't omnipotent, so if you see something that should be removed, it doesn't hurt to let us know about it. And for all those who have been reporting, Thank you very much, it makes finding inappropriate posts much, much easier.

Secondly, I'd like to point out to new and old readers alike that the sidebar *does* contain a list of rules to follow when posting. We get a lot of content that should otherwise be destined for /r/gamingsuggestions, and they all get removed as soon as they're seen. If you see someone asking about 'what game to play' or similar, feel free to provide the suggestion of a redirection (and a report if you feel necessary), and we'll take it from there. Additionally, replies to a post which don't back up or expand on their answer to a question posed will generally be removed. These replies are usually one-liner posts which answer a question and don't justify their answer. 

Third, one of our moderators (docjesus) had set up a temporary IRC channel one night for some chatting. I went ahead and made this channel permanent at #reddit-truegaming on irc.freenode.net. It's in the sidebar, and the channel is quite lonely right now. The purpose is to serve as a more informal chat with the crowd you enjoy discussing games with.

Apart from the striking home screen similarities to WoW, the textures, lighting and models feel like slightly ""meaner"" WoW creatures.  Set pieces are epic and beautiful, cracks in the earth are pretty, vast overreaches are a gorgeous fantasy setting.  Nothing like the claustrophobia of D2's Act 1, heat and void of Act 2, and depression and darkness of Act 3.

* The atmosphere feels like WoW. 

I'm surprised that overall, I'm not disturbed by what I'm seeing.  I still get scared by games, I can still be surprised, I can still be irked and creeped out, so why is Diablo 3 failing to do that?  The answer is that the textures and models, although sharp and imaginative, still appear cartoony to me.  It's *High Res WoW*.

* And what of the single player experience? 

As I wander solo through the game, I feel that blizzard is telling me ""the reason this game feels empty is because you're not playing with anyone else.""  Imagine what WoW would feel like if suddenly every player except you was disconnected.  That's what Diablo 3 feels like.

* Am I wrong?

Should I not compare this game to Diablo 1 and 2? Should I look at this game in its own right instead?

For a bit of background information, I Am Alive is an Ubisoft survival horror/action game released on the PSN and XBLA, telling the story of a man trying to find his family in post apocalyptic America. What I gathered from the demo, the game is most focused on exploration, combat and climbing puzzles. You can find more information [here](http://iamalive-game.ubi.com/iamalive/en-gb/index.aspx).

The game was mostly very average (stiff controls, muddy graphics, not much backstory), but the combat mechanics are something that stuck with me strongly, so please bear with me.

Half an hour in the demo I was wandering through a dusty sewer, trying to find a way into the city above. A junction appears, and I can see light coming from behind the corner. Looks like there is a survivor sitting on a chair by a burning barrel. ""Okay"", I think, ""maybe this is an NPC that will guide me to my objective"". I walk around the corner towards the bum, and he immediately brandishes a handgun from his pocket. ""Oh crap, I guess I have to kill this guy instead"", I think as I sprint towards the man while smashing the attack button (your only weapon at this point is an unloaded gun). Curiously though, my character does nothing, and I die after two shots to the chests. I'm returned to the checkpoint, which was luckily just before this section. I begin wondering if melee attack is invoked by another button while I swiftly engage the bum again and get shot down just as fast as last time. ""Why does my character not attack?!"", I think as I repeat the section once more, not faring any better.

The fourth time I turn the corner and stand there defiantly. I stand and wait for the survivor once again to decimate me with his pesky handgun, barring my passage to the next section. This time is different however: no shots are fired. The man just says something to the extent of ""You just better keep on walking!"" while my character lifts his hands up carefully, to show no hostile intent. It is not until now that I notice that the armed survivor is not actually blocking the route to my objective. The correct path is actually in a way totally opposite of the man I was trying to confront. I slowly back away from the man, haul my ass along the correct path and confusedly exit the sewer.

Turns out, that the combat mechanics of I Am Alive differ greatly from the norm. All enemies are not inherently trying to kill you, some are just scared and trying very hard to stay alive in the vicious post apocalyptic future. Now first, I felt totally retarded for not understanding this, as the game even had a hint about it on the loading screen. But really, when you think about it, this is such an old trope of game design that it just feels natural. When an enemy draws his gun in a game, you don't press a button to ask him to chill, you press a button to kill him so you can advance to the next section. I'm not saying it should necessarily be otherwise, but these kind of mechanics do feel like a welcome break from the norm. So my question is this: **what are some unexpected/subverted game mechanics that positively surprised you?**

In closing I might add that awkward encounters with armed bums isn't all that the combat system consists of. I don't want to spoil the mechanics, but the psychological combat in I Am Alive really is unique and interesting, so try out the free demo if you feel like it.",,False,,t5_2sgq6,False,,,True,t3_stplh,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/stplh/subverted_game_mechanics/,

Nobody wants to spend 20+ hours on a game only to lose at the very end. This is a fair position to have. 

However, for me at least, this means that most FPS's and other action type games have become really stale. I like challenge and get bored with games that I know I will win no matter what. 

This is why I absolutely love the Left 4 Dead model. On the hardest difficulty, the game is extremely challenging, especially considering you can't save during each section. If you mess up, it's back to the beginning of the section. But because each section only takes 15-30 minutes, losing at the very end isn't a huge deal. Instead, you learn from your mistakes and try again. Awesome. 

Even better, this ads a ton of replayability, as you can start yourself on an average difficulty and work your way up as you get better and more familiar with the game. Not a lot of people are going to beat the game on the hardest difficulty right out of the box. Instead, you have to really master the game before you can move up. This is in direct contrast to most other FPS's in which starting on the highest difficulty merely means a longer delay towards the time in which you inevitably win. Boring. 

So, why isn't this format more popular? Why do game devs insist on a singular, uninterrupted narrative over the Left 4 Dead structure of 4+ connected campaigns in which losing is a an actual possibility and winning isn't guaranteed?

The main reason why I chose this path was because of the ""good ending"" hint, but while I played self-justifications appeared, none of them positive.

The justification were different between the common enemies and ""main targets"".

The common guards struck me as amoral and spineless to their superiors. They followed orders whoever was in charge — it was useful to keep them alive so they would follow Emily's orders when all these problems are sorted. No reason to kill people useful to me, and their replacement would be no better. The bandits seemed no worse than guards — just without the uniforms. In Dunwall, judging them was pointless.

For the main targets, proposed non-lethal solutions were actually more cruel than murder, and more deserved. Why would I just kill Campbell if I could make him a hated exile? Lord Regent? Let him rot in the prison or be executed after a lengthy trial. And so on.

Daud is probably the most cynical case — I actually was looking forward avenging the Empress, but after the fight he asked me for his life, and I thought ""Just go the hell away from here, I do not even care anymore"". Even a morally/emotionally simple task of avenging a loved one turned into a tired dismissal.

In general, it was an unexpected effect. Instead of morally high ground I found that non-lethal path is a path of pragmatism and calculated cruelty.

I came across [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/16z5ki/what_makes_an_mmo_crafting_system_fun/) and I really wanted to contribute, but I felt a little late to the party. So, I'm posting my comment in this (hopefully acceptable) fashion to get some attention and responses.**

I’m kind of surprised that nobody has mentioned Runescape’s crafting system. Now, surely some of you are already laughing, but I think I have a valid point and would like to share it.

From what I’ve been reading, Runescape’s crafting system is no SWG, EVE, or FFXI, but it is a system that has managed to persist and keep players engaged for over 12(!) years. To sum it up concisely, it is a system that has fostered a strong economy that allows for both old and new players to earn steady incomes and reap immense benefits at the highest of skill levels. The heart of Runescape’s gameplay has always been about earning money and the concept of “training” skills has seemingly been nothing more than a natural byproduct of that philosophy. Mindless gathering skills such as woodcutting, mining, or fishing, are only seen as worthwhile because the players understand that they’re earning money and they will continue to earn exponentially more money as they invest more and more time in their particular skill of choice. Of course, some of the production side Runescape’s crafting has lost a lot of profitability with the introduction of immensely powerful weapons only available through monster drops (cooking, herblore, and runecrafting are still relevant), but completionists and player vanity have managed to keep the system nicely afloat.

Now, it is my belief that Runescape’s crafting has been successful because of three core components that (IME) many modern MMO’s lack, whether intentionally or not.

**It takes a long LONG time to reach the high levels where real money can be made.**

&gt;This guarantees that the market will not be flooded with high level goods and it gives crafters a massive sense of accomplishment for reaching such high skill levels.

**New players aren’t alienated because gathering skills are always necessary for finding resources and anyone can pick them up to immediately start earning some money.**

&gt;This allows the economy to always have plenty of resources available for crafters and it helps to retain new players that would otherwise be scared away by the massive time investment required to earn “real” money on the production side of crafting.

**The focus of the game is on earning money, not leveling up.**

&gt;This means that the game isn’t “over” once a player maximizes their combat level. In fact, players cannot practically or efficiently max their character’s combat skills without owning massive amounts of money already to buy their gear, potions, food, etc.

To clarify my first point, I would like to say that, a long time in Runescape is not measured in weeks, but in months. The measly amount of time it takes to reach max level other MMO’s I’ve played is laughable compared to Runescape and that is what makes all of the difference.

My second point can be argued against in the sense that almost any other game allows players to sell materials to crafters too, but the difference is that Runescape requires MASSIVE amounts of resources to be used when leveling up crafting skills. Unlike many modern MMO’s, this means that passively collecting wood/metals as you walk around or resources dropped by monsters is not a viable way to earn money and would massively under-supply crafters. Earning money from gathering resources becomes a profession (which is why it is a skill) rather than a passive byproduct of time spent questing and killing monsters. 

I also want to clarify my third point by saying that many modern MMO’s seem to focus on the player being the one to find their own loot. This makes trading, and consequently crafting, irrelevant because the player often believes that they have a pretty good chance of simply finding X, Y, or Z equipment on their own. This makes the focus not so much on earning money, but instead on fighting monsters, which is fine unless you want an engaging crafting system. The incredibly low drop rate for rare items in Runescape is what compels players to buy equipment instead of find it.

To ensure longevity in a game and give players that sense of playing in a virtual world, it is my belief that the above core concepts must be adhered to. Runescape’s atrocious graphics and combat have always steered players away, but I think the crafting (and questing!!!) is what was done right. If a modern MMO implemented a crafting system modeled around similar concepts, then I would expect it to have a bright future. This is something I have been hoping to see for years to no avail.

However, it seems like every single MMORPG is a hotkey based, auto lock on, non action game.  WoW of course is obvious, SWTOR as well.  DCUO almost breaks the mold a little bit but really it's just faster to mask the underlying hotkeyness.

Even Guild Wars 2, while it seems *slightly* more active, at its heart it is the same style.

Why can't there be an MMORPG with the gameplay of Skyrim, where there is no auto lock on and you actually have to connect with enemies and there is a physics model.  Or I just played the demo for Kingdoms of Amalur which melds God of War style gameplay into an RPG - why can't there be an MMORPG like that.

It's possible I haven't explained myself perfectly.  But why can't there be an MMORPG with actual physics, or REAL action gameplay?

* On-disc DLC
* Games requiring an internet connection for single-player

* Various anti-piracy and DRM measures that have caused me headaches
* Exclusive content for preorders, collectors editions, etc. that actually affect the balance of a competitive game
* Allow players to purchase unlockables, while making those unlockables more difficult or time-consuming to obtain

etc.

I know everybody complains about these, but I'm genuinely kind of uncomfortable with a lot of these. I'm not really one to kick up a fuss on the internet and complain, but rather I just don't buy games that do this. It's a pain to actually have to research a game I want, just to see if it's going to make me feel like I'm getting swindled.

When I see the direction this is going, and I hear rumors about the next generation of systems having safeguards against used games, requiring a constant online connection, etc. I just wonder if I've gotten too old for this or something...I really can't tell. Anyway, I'm gonna see what the next generation of consoles brings, but I'm thinking more and more that I might sit this one out and just play older games and see what happens...I just genuinely get a bad feeling about what's going on nowadays.

Anybody else feel the same way? Or should I just try and warm up to a lot of these ideas?",,False,,t5_2sgq6,False,,,True,t3_sut53,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/sut53/anybody_else_feel_like_they_might_skip_the_next/,

It's a plea to use your imagination and never fast travel.",SuperConductiveRabbi,306,139,269,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/mtlsm/for_those_who_find_skyrim_boring_let_me_recount/,"For me, the enjoyment and immersion of Skyrim grow out of my willingness to take my time and interact with the world as my character would. As another Redditor said, it's a blank canvas for you to fill up. The narrative that you weave, the mixture of quests your character chooses to take or decline, and the skills you use to solve problems are what gives the game its magic. You have to combine your imagination with the tools the game gives you, and from that you'll experience rewarding gameplay. 

I'll recount two experiences I had last night, to give an example of this. (Both of them would've been impossible had I fast traveled.):

----

I've finished a quest and now have to return to my guildhall to receive another, which requires passing through a mountain, going through a mining town, and following a river a short distance. Although I could easily fast-travel and be given my next quest within minutes, I decide to walk, as this is how my character would have to actually make the journey. To receive a quest at the culmination of my journey will be a reward.

As I approach the mountain I'm quickly presented with the problem of how to get around it. I enjoy attempting to climb mountains, and my light armor seems to make my character well-suited for this. It's as I'm making a detour around a sheer cliff face that I discover a man-made stacking of stones, indicating a path exists under the layers of snow and ice. I follow the markers when I overhear talking; being a thief-like adventurer, I creep around a boulder to discover a young redguard woman trying to convince her argonian companion to let her delve into the cave and hunt for adventure. It's easy work picking such an unwary woman's pocket, and I discover a note from her father, telling her not to trust the argonian bodyguard; he writes that she's to return home when she grows weary of her little game. A similar note in the argonian's robe tells him he will live to regret it if she comes to harm through his inaction. Having used my thievery skills to get a handle on this situation I present myself, feeling pity for the plight of the worried father. I agree to help, and I'm soon trying to keep up with the eager girl as we press deeper into the snow-swept cave. I kill numerous powerful enemies, many of whom bring the girl the point of begging for mercy. 

Without spoiling the conclusion of this mini-quest, I was satisfied to get some loot, see closure for her story, and discover a path out the other side of the mountain. Seeing the mining town at the base of this windswept mountain reminds me that I can't dwell on her fate, and I resume my goal of returning to my guildhall--which now seems more appealing for its warmth, rather than just being a dispensary of quests.

On the way, however, I come across three well-armed Thalmor soldiers who are escorting a man in manacles: he's clearly a middle-aged townsman, wearing the finely crafted clothes of a merchant. He's not some bandit or cultist, which are clearly Skyrim's *true* danger: I've walked the length of the land, and I'm in a good position to weigh the threat of countless bandits and outlaws against the political gesturing of rich, prejudiced outlanders. (My character has additional reasons to hate the Thalmor, ever since an incident involving a cruel noblewoman and a barmaiden employed at their embassy.) Despite having doubts about being able to defeat three well-armed guards with only unremarkable armor to protect me, I approach the procession. The Thalmor immediately draw their swords, but reveal that their captive has ""knowledge of Thalos,"" and will be interrogated until he reveals ""secrets."" Knowledge of Thalos is a ridiculous reason to torture someone, I believe, and the Jarl in Whiterun--where I have my house--even allows a fanatical Thalos priest to prosteletize, giving me wisdom to judge that this is not a crime. Being a good but not-entirely-lawful character, this is something I'm going to stop.

Once they are almost out of sight I creep along in the scrubland's modest cover, following at a distance until we are well past the small mining town. They turn from the river and proceed into a water-hewn canyon just as night is falling...an excellent position that I'll use to my advantage. Using the speed granted by light armor and hard-earned skill, I run ahead of the Thalmor and alight on the uppermost precipice of the canyon. I place my prized, hard-earned collection of ebony arrows--a mere pawfull--into my quiver, and watch the guards loudly shuffle, single-file, on the cavern floor below. I dip the first arrow into an elixer of paralysis-causing plants and roots--a refined potion of my own alchemical devising, and notch it. I steady my breath, pick the right moment, and see my well-timed shot decelerate directly into the chest of the rear guard. Paralyzed, an arrow piercing through the center of his elven armor, all he can do is stare helplessly at his companions' backs while, high above, I notch another arrow and carefully take aim.

***TL; DR***: The narrative you create in Skyrim is a blend of your own imagination and the storytelling opportunities the game gives you.

1318971129.0,167,self.truegaming,lgoxh,Demon's Souls made me a better gamer,ShadyJane,203,36,135,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/lgoxh/demons_souls_made_me_a_better_gamer/,"A week ago I noticed Demon’s Souls was $18 on amazon and figured I’d finally take the time to see what so many people seem to be raving and/or raging about.  It was delivered last Tuesday and I rushed home from work to finally give it a go.  During that first night I had played for 4 hours and I got up to 2-3k souls twice and lost them all…twice.  I had to put the game down and walk away.  I wasn’t mad.  I wasn’t even bothered.  I was blown away at how much this game made me self-reflect on my abilities/inabilities.  It is a trait devoid from every other single player game in memory.

There was never a question in my mind as to why I died.  I took on too many enemies at once.  I wasn’t careful on the stairwell/cliff edge.  I mashed buttons because I was nervous.  I tried to heal before getting enough distance.  I don’t have enough endurance to block a strong attack.  Why did that normal attack break my block?  I didn’t lower my shield to regain endurance fast enough to block the next attack.  Everything could be pinpointed and the cause was invariably my fault.  However, with every death came the subsequent learning process.  I did my best not to make the same mistake again (still working on it :P) and in turn I always got a little further than the time before.

Skip a little further ahead and I’m towards the end of 1-2…where there are two blue-eyes knights and a handful of archers waiting for you after evading the fire breathing dragon on the bridge.  I died there 21 times.  Count it.  21.  That’s not even counting the deaths before 1-2.  I’m not counting the deaths while learning the level.  I’m only counting the times I died at the end.  That’s 21 times of making it over the bridge only to be killed by the knights.  Now just to qualify this: I didn’t have the thief’s ring, missed it first time, so every time I’d get past the last flaming gauntlet all 5 archers (3 on ground; 2 above) would fire at me while one blue knight comes charging.  This was also the first time I had lost 4 digits worth of souls.

I felt like I was beating my head against a steel wall, but oddly enough I didn’t want to stop playing.  If anything I was *more* engaged than when I started.  I wanted to get better.  I wanted to teabag those fucking blue-eyed knights.  So I went back to 1-1 and practiced…by facing off with the red-eyed knight with the lance.  I died another dozen times or so but let me tell ya, the first time I killed him I cheered so loud and with such enthusiasm that you’d think I was piss drunk.

I eagerly ran to the corner he was guarding and the first player-message I read was a simple “Welcome”.  This was more profound to me than I can adequately describe.  The welcome wasn’t just for getting to the new area; it was also a “welcome to the club”; “welcome to the next step”; it was akin to the camaraderie you experience at events like marathons where everyone is just rooting for everyone else.  I felt empowered and knew exactly how to utilize such feelings.  I teabagged those two blue eyes knights and as I imagined my digital genitalia plopping onto the supposed mouths of these two hell spawn I realized that the giant red dragon was annoying  me and therefore needed to die.  Soul levels?  Hah!  I’ll take 10,000 souls worth of arrows please.

Demon’s Souls taught me that I am to blame for everything (including success!).  It taught me to be overly objective in analysis.  It taught me that patience ALWAYS pays off.  It taught me that eagerness leads to mistakes.  More than anything else it taught me that the last laugh is the best laugh.  SUCK IT FALSE KING!!  These are probably things most people already know in gaming but don’t practice.  I didn’t, but Demon’s Souls made me.  It was the only way.

Oddly enough I am now also better at Starcraft2 (Plat league /flex)…

**TL;DR for those on the fence – This game is not hard.  It is completely and utterly unforgiving.  If you cannot handle the idea that YOU make mistakes and YOU need to learn from them then you will never complete or enjoy this game.  It’s not for everyone and that’s the beauty of it.**

Mostly because I am lazy and that is an easy format to work with.

**Pros:**  
Tons upon tons of customization. The passive skill tree is massive and how you skill changes your character completely. It makes it a lot of fun to level up and plan out your skills and it makes you feel like your character is uber unique. 

Skill gems are a lot of fun. Its awesome to be able to mix and match your spells as you want and still be able to level them up. Also support gems are awesome. Want to throw fireballs that split into more fireballs as they hit people? Or do you want to make your lightning arrows fire 5 instead of 1 and then pierce? Easily done. This level of customization makes the character feel like it is yours. Makes it feel like you are roleplaying more so than most games. 

Large variety of monsters and they attack in different ways and each provide their own challenge. 

PvP, they have PvP.

No constraints. If midway through the game you want to spec your warrior to be an archer. Just grab the passive skill that lets bows scale off of strength and go for it. 

Graphics are pretty damn good. Especially on the spells. Arrows stick into people when you shoot them and into walls when you miss.  

They have a fucking sweet, balanced, necromancer. 

THE FUCKING AMAZING BARTER SYSTEM. 


**Cons:**  
Shitty map. Seriously it needs work. It is often hard to tell what is a wall and what is a path on the map. 

Learning curve is a little rough for the first few hours of the game as there is so much customization and very little direction.

They story is barely noticeable. I have gotten through the first act and all I can really say is I was exiled to a different continent and now I am killing monsters. Oh and the witch is fucking bonkers. 

Can't remap mouse buttons. And the game thinks you want to use your mousewheel as a button. We don't. No one has ever wanted to do that ever. Especially since you also have that mapped to zoom. I don't want to zoom in on that monkey. I want to flame his ass. 

PvP, it is horribly imbalanced PvP. And its only deathmatch at least at my level. 

**Summary:**

The game is awesome but has a lot of work to be done on it. I fully expect the map and mouse buttons to be fixed, there is a good chance that the learning curve issue will be fixed with a tutorial, I don't know if the storyline will be sufficiently improved upon (its not really the focus of ARPGs). 

I am interested in your guys opinions on it so far.

There was no help, no tutorial, and a whole bunch of shops with surprisingly expensive customization gear for your avatar and your potential home.  Not at all what I was expecting!

*	What have TD games done right, what are your favorite features, and what keeps you hooked?
*	What have TD games done wrong, and what makes you lose interest?
*	What do you feel is missing from (one or many) TD games?
*	What do you consider a ‘must have’ in any TD game?
*	Imagine you could have your perfect TD game made just for you.  What would it look like?  What features would it have?  How would it play?

Who knows, perhaps some of this discussion might end up in a TD game. ;)

1327565622.0,171,self.truegaming,oxde9,".Hack// and why the theoretical game, ""The World"" should be an example for developing MMORPGs. (x-post with /r/ludology.)",Quagonn,212,41,155,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/oxde9/hack_and_why_the_theoretical_game_the_world/,"So I posted this to /r/ludology, but I thought you guy's might want to discuss it aswell. Please excuse the many spelling and grammar errors, but I didn't really have the time to proof read this more than once.    
  
Recently I had replayed the original .Hack// quadrilogy. The fake mmorpg that I played in the game was better than any mmorpg I have played, and I have played a lot of mmorpgs. I think this is due to a single key element that would drastically improve the mmo experience. This element is the fact that players are left to their own devices.  
  
The bettering of MMOs depends solely on the removal of saftey nets, and the complete dependance on player driven goals  
  
Currently in mmos you are given a set purpose from the beginning, do the quests these npcs give and do nothing more, this makes the game dull and un-engaging with the only motivation is to get from point a to point b. The solution to this is to make the entire reason to do things player driven. In ""The World"" the player finds all of his places of interest by information from other players posting on a message bored, and e-mails from other player. Your first thought might be, well if the player isn't given a purpose, he will just do nothing However, while they may have no goal at first, they will start to look for other things to do. While at the same time, another player will need something that he can't get without assistance. The player with nothing to do sees the player and need and suddenly he is no longer bored, maybe he does it for a reward. Without a safety net, these players will actively look for a purpose, and as long as they are given the tools to communicate their requests, there will be players looking for requests to fill. This method would probably be best implemented in a sort of request board, where players could posts quests for other players to view; complete with sections detailing the place, time frame, what they need, and the reward. As long as there is some kind of quality control, this would work fine. This not only takes not only takes away the artificial purpose of players, but it also creates a stronger game community based on co-operation.  
  
Part of this player driven system would be the need to remove ALL safety nets. The best example of this in ""The World"" is the fact that you can be killed any where outside of town, any time, by anyone, and if you are killed you lose all progress gained from when you left town. At first you might think, but then high level players would be able to go into low level areas and ruin the game for them. Well let's say that were to happen, and these high level players were ruining the game for the noobies. Well one of these new players can post about it on the request board. Then a group of high level players think, ""what a jerk."" and they go hunt down the guy killing new player, maybe they form a squad to enforce this. BAM, that anti-player killing squad just gave the player a goal of which is theoretically endless. The other thought that comes with this proposal, wouldn't it be better if the high level player couldn't kill the low level players and we just prevent this over all? well no. Again with the removal of safety nets people will just find innovative ways to prevent these problems, the way they solve them is just another thing on the list of 'stuff to do in this mmorpg'. Moreover, this goes back to the whole, building a strong community. With the need to help each other out to enjoy the game, people will build a strong community, made of real personal bonds.  
  
I think the best way to sum it up, is that the gratitude and personal bonds coupled with the tangible reward the player may offer, is way better than the 50gp you get from Iroth the npc blacksmith.
Anyway, those are just my thoughts on what I think is holding back mmos, applied to an example.

For example, when I was a kid (I am a young gamer) Nintendo had this little unpopular thing called the e-reader. For the few people who don't know, this allowed people to buy cards and scan them into GBA and Gamecube games. Now as a kid, I saw this as bonus content. The game was shipped and you can buy cards to add more to it. But seeing the reactions to current DLC tends, I can't help but wonder if there would be backlash of this method was employed today, not as adding content but as Nintendo removing content to sell later.

Older gamers can probably help with this, was the e-reader ever seen as a way to remove content and sell later, like DLC is today? When I was a kid the thought never occure to me, and I wonder if it did for older gamers at the time. Assuming it didn't incite the same sort of rage, when did such a distribution system turn from ""adding content"" to ""removing content""?

Obviously the discussion is not just limited to e-readers and the like, that was just my example of choice.

EDIT: Apparently people are interpreting this question as ""When did DLC become a thing?"" This is not the question.

Currently, the only stealth I can personally recall (that is good) from recently is Deus Ex: Human Revolution, and even there, stealth is but an option.

So my question, of course, is why? I'd also like to here your comments on stealth as a genre and why so many attempts at stealth have failed so hard. I can only recall 3 IPs dedicated to stealth that were very competent, Thief, Hitman, and Splinter Cell.

SPOILERS!!!**,Plato_Karamazov,245,80,161,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/16lttd/why_i_absolutely_love_the_witcher_2_assassins_of/,"I have just finished The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings tonight, and I cannot get over how amazing it was.

I should mention that I have previously played The Witcher 1 and a lot of my actions in AoK were dictated by what I did in the first game (joining the Scoia'Tael, for example), and the relationships I had forged with the characters in Vizima.

For the first time in a very long time, perhaps since Planescape: Torment, I was being treated like an adult. There was no draconian moral structure, and I was often to choose between several bad options.

In the first game, I set out to get all of the Sex Cards, and some of how I chose to play was influenced by that [perverted] goal. However, the one quest where the prostitutes were vampires and were attacked by the Order of the Flaming Rose, I chose the good option for bad reasons. I had chosen in the end to marry Triss and adopt Alvin. 

In the second game, because I had married her in the first game, I had  an immediate emotional bond to her character, and I told her in the Elven bath that I would find the Kingslayer and settle down with her. I stayed true to this goal through the game, eventually condemning Phillipa and Sile to death, and almost getting Iorveth killed. I also declined sex with Cynthia after completing the Dearhenna quests, remembering that she had put Triss in the figurine.

But far beyond that, what sets AoK apart from other RPGs is the sheer depth of the world, absolutely heavy with a history and a mythology, not to be hidden on bookshelves waiting to be picked up and read at the player's leisure, but rather put forth as a necessary medium for storytelling within the game. The histories of the monsters and where they came from, as well as the overarching narrative of Yennefer and the Wild Hunt are incredibly constructed and display a kind of storytelling very rarely seen in games, particularly those as violent and unforgiving as The Witcher. 

I want to make a particular note here on violence and the (lack of) value of human life in The Witcher. When we walk into Flotsam and witness the hanging, and the sheer nonchalance with which the authority and the other people react to the extermination of human life sets The Witcher apart. This is a world more brutal than that of any other game on the market, and the hanging in Flotsam was the moment in which I was playing an ""adult"" game in the best sense of the word; it was the moment in which I fell in love with this game. Furthermore, the amount of backstabbing and betrayal in AoK rivals that of even Final Fantasy Tactics, which itself was Shakespearean in its body count. 

Some games, such as Fallout, pepper their bleakness with dark Cold War humor and campy science fiction. There is almost none of that, save for off-color Lord of the Rings references. Very rarely is any of the pervasive despair within the world of The Witcher ever alleviated.

I am most pleased, also, that Letho is not some stupid goon; despite his unassuming appearance, he is an extremely worthy and intelligent adversary who meticulously calculated his every move, and has no misguided lofty goals, save for the restoration of his own Witcher's School. Nor is there any other reason for them to be fighting than for the sheer fact that Letho framed Geralt for the murder of King Foltest and the mutual respect for having eluded each other for nearly the entire game.

On the subject of kings, I love that every single leader save Saskia callously manipulated their subjects into stupid battles for their own vanity. It showed you what politics really are, and why Geralt so despised his own king, even as he protected him. 

The Witcher 2 was simply brilliant on every level, and I highly doubt that we will find another game so carefully constructed as this one.

Anyway, the reason video game reviews are so bad is that nobody has a set of standards for what a video game even is.  When we say ""video game"", we mean games, we mean puzzles, we mean simulators, we mean toys, crafting applications - we mean literally ANY kind of interactive software.  Of course, each of these things must be judged by its own merits, but right now we're lumping them ALL into one gigantic group.

So what ends up happening?  We talk about the stuff that is common to all of them.  How does the application run?  Is it buggy?  How is the UI?  DLC?  HD tech-crap?  Etc.  It's very, very infrequent that I hear anything said about gameplay, and when it is, it's completely shallow and never insightful.  Granted, most games don't have amazingly deep or interesting gameplay these days, but that's partially caused by this same problem.

What we need is a developed set of very basic STANDARDS - principles that we all for what a game *IS*.  Cinema has this, music has this, books have this - a great example is people from boardgames, which have a way more solid understanding of their medium than we do. 

TL;DR:  Game reviews, and even games themselves, are suffering because we don't have a developed set of standards which help us to know what makes a good game or a bad game.

(Likely minor spoilers)",TheCynicalGamer,278,118,242,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1b8e63/bioshock_infinite_what_the_hell_happened_during/,"I'd like to bring to the table example A:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEBwKO4RFOU

Please watch the above 15 minutes of gameplay and ponder how little of that actually made it into the game:

- Non-aggressive NPC's that don't realize who you are until you do something drastic, and whom you an interact with in non-violent contextual circumstances

- Elizabeth reacts to the environment prompting conversations which build depth and character.

- Very dense scenes with NPC setpieces creating a far richer tapestry of the world that you are exploring. Only the opening level of the shipped product is as rich as this scene.

- Vigors based on an inventory stock instead of a refillable mana bar.

- Very, very, very large environments with HUGE skyline segments, combat on the skylines, and ""3D"" combat (Ground, Skyline, Zeppelin)

- AI that is noticeably more advanced than the current, including flanking and shifting to different levels in the environment to gain an advantage.

- Dialogue that is present in the shipped product, but in dramatically different situations and context, implying that the story was scrapped and re-written VERY late in development (this is Q3 2011, remember). Elizabeths line in the trailer where she mentions asking Comstock for help escaping is itself a potent indicator that the story was vastly different.

- The flowing Vox banners feature Daisies face projected on them in a very 1984-esque fashion, highlighting her similarity to Comstock and adding narrative. There are few to no animated textures of this nature anywhere in the released game, and none on Vox topics. The voice-overs from these can still be heard, truncated, in a few sections.

After having gone back and watched several of these, I've come to the conclusion that the product which was shipped out to stores contains not even a fraction of the actual assets that were developed for this game. In comparison the AI is incredibly dumbed down, and the world is a sterile theme park which you are railroaded through. 

It honestly feels like the Infinite which was released is either an earlier build than what is shown in these videos, or a patchwork of assets which was hacked together at the very end of the development cycle in order to ship a product by a specific date. This is supported by several jarring issues in the final game, primarily Abandoned Game Mechanics:

- Vox Cyphers &amp; Crows Chests are both implied to be recurring elements, to the extent that they even feature voiced dialogue and in-game tutorials about them. Yet there are two cyphers and 3 crow chests, in the entire game.

- In the first level, after you find the first crow chest, you enter a mansion and are given a tutorial prompt which suggests  ""Try not shooting your gun and drawing attention to yourself"" Clearly this is a remnant the 2011 build in the video above, where enemies were not instant-hostile zerglings, but is useless in the release build as all enemies shoot on sight.

- The previously inventory-based vigor system appears to have been changed *very* late in development, as the old pick-up bottles are still to be found scattered throughout levels, but now only act as salt refills.

- The design of many early levels, such as Soldiers Field, feel very odd and out of context, and not designed for Combat. I suspect these were originally built as the ""hub"" levels when the game was more open world, and then pared down when it was cut up into a linear shooter.

- There is an interview with Ken Levine, I believe from 2010, discussing an artist quitting after they axed the Shantytown segment because it made little sense on the context of a floating nationalist utopia. Mysteriously, Shantytown is back in the release build. Likely this was done to fit the new narrative.

There are several instances in the course of the game which, upon reflection, are shoe-horning in assets that they had paid to develop and needed to justify the cost of, but which make very little sense when the whole cloth is examined.

When it comes down to it, comparing what was shipped to what was promoted leading up to launch, I actually do believe Ken Levines quote of having ""Cut enough content to make ten games"". Unfortunately, it's clear that they cut out the vast majority of what had made Infinite unique, and replaced it with a severely reduced linear shooter.

It is a testament to Irrational that they were able to pull together a very enjoyable product in what appears to be a very short span of time, but the shipped game is also *clearly* not the one that was in development for so long, and only a pale shadow in terms of depth in both gameplay and worldbuilding.

So again, the question, what the hell went wrong during development that caused this level of scrapping at the last minute?",,False,,t5_2sgq6,1364550545.0,,,True,t3_1b8e63,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1b8e63/bioshock_infinite_what_the_hell_happened_during/,

And to top it all off, it had the craziest and creepiest atmosphere I had ever seen in a game at that time.    
  
I guess the only game that's come close to that recently is Dragon's Dogma.  It has some flaws, sure.  I was frustrated a few times playing it.  What sold it for me was stepping down into my first dungeon.  The only light I had was a few feet of radiance from my lantern, and I had no idea if I was going to step on a snake or the foot of an ogre.  It brought back some of those old feelings for me.  
  
Well that was a little long.  Tell me some stories.  
  
**EDIT:**  So many good responses here, thanks for giving me an enjoyable Friday morning reading all this.  
  
Morrowind is the top comment, and for good reason I think.  By far my favorite elder scrolls game, and I hope to dive back into it when Overhaul 3.0 gets released.  
  
I was glad to see Wind Waker so far up the list.  Easily my favorite Zelda game to date.  Good to see I'm not the only one who enjoyed sailing around the world aimlessly.  
  
I spent so much time playing WoW that it's left a bittersweet aftertaste, but it was my first MMO and it was spectacular exploring that world for the first time.  
  
I was surprised Baldur's Gate was so far down the last, and I was even more surprised I didn't see Diablo 1 at all.  But I can understand, all good selections and I am taking notes to investigate some of them further.  Thanks!

1355559956.0,162,self.truegaming,14vzgg,I believe that MMO's and achievements have ruined gaming for me.,Captain_Baby,313,151,217,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/14vzgg/i_believe_that_mmos_and_achievements_have_ruined/,"I don't play video games for fun anymore. That's what I realized when I was playing Fallout 3 earlier today. I play them to complete objectives, to get achievements, that kind of shit. It's why I will play the fuck out of a game when I first get it, and never ever do any exploring. 

When I was going through Hitman, at the beginning I was telling myself that I would do it as stealthily as possible, and when I saw that there were challenges for doing it only in the suit, I was like, ""Yes. I will do that."" I didn't. If a part was too hard I would just run and gun my way to the next part. I was playing on a difficulty that was way to high for me, all because there was an achievement for doing so.

The reason I got rid of Rage two weeks after picking it up, and never playing past the two hour mark? I was playing on the hardest difficulty, and that allowed a boss to be able to one shot me, and I would have to go through an entire building with no save points every time it killed me. Because of an achievement.

I went through Borderlands 1 again, all because I wanted those achievements that I hadn't gotten the first time I played the dlcs.

My friend Frank thinks that achievements are being misused by developers.

It isn't that.

That may be a valid concern, but it isn't my problem.
I just have to get them. Achievements, or some other arbitrary goal that I set for myself. The last time I went through Fallout 3 I was trying to find every location on the map. That was because I wanted to have every location on the map! I didn't care about exploring, I just wanted every little dot to be there!

I have to get the achievements, but I hate having to replay the parts of the game over and over again to do so. It's why I hate Dragon Age 1 now. I played through it so many times it's just boring to me.
I know everything that's going to happen, every location, everything!

The only reason I can still play Fallout New Vegas is because I still have specific things that I need to do! Finish the game with Yes Man, do 10,000 Explosives and Unarmed damage, complete Lonesome Road that came out two fucking years ago!

I couldn't even play RED DEAD FUCKING REDEMPTION, my absolute favorite game, for more than twenty minutes today!

It's why I liked WoW so much. Everything was a goddamned achievement. 

You cleared this dungeon for the first time?

Here's an achievement!

You have this certain level of a profession?

Here's an achievement!

You have this many pets?

Here's a fucking achievement!

I can't enjoy a game unless it's the first time I'm playing it, during which time I will farm it for as many achievements as I can until I finish the game. My friend Alex was surprised when he saw that I had sold Just Cause 2 to Gamestop in order to be able to pay for Hitman. I was likely never going to play that game again. And that is one of the most fun games I have ever played. Minus the story.

I don't know what's wrong with me. I don't know how to have fun anymore.

My friend Frank from before suggested that I put the Xbox aside for a little bit and go back to a time before Achievements; that I should start playing around with a console from before that time, like PS2 or N64. If I have to, use emulators.

But achievements are only a part of the problem. A major contributor, yes, but only a part. I have to be doing something in a game. I always have to be doing something. If I don't have a strict guideline telling me what to do, then I don't know what to do. All those old game are just ""Go here do this"" ""Go there do that"" It's the same but with no room for experimentation.

Zelda games, for instance. Go in this dungeon, clear the rooms, take the shit, fight the boss, you win. The only thing that changes is how much health you have and what stuff you use. The game is always the same. I beat it once, the game is done. I can't play it anymore.

I tried to wander around in Fallout 3. Just to go exploring, and see the world through dust splattered eyes. You wanna know what happenend?

I started in Megaton. Nothing but Combat Armor, a hunting rifle, a 10mm pistol, the repellent stick because I had just started that quest for Moira, and Dogmeat. I left the town and decided to head southwest. I walked until I found some city ruins.

I wandered over to a map marker and it continued farther than the door I had found, so I decided to ignore it and head inside. I went through a manhole and snuck through the basement area. Inside, I killed a few raiders and took their shit. I walked out the door and was greeted by four more raiders.

I ran back inside, not know that they would follow me in. Eventually, I gunned them all down and went out the door again. I looked around and killed a raider with a missile launcher. I took it and used it on the next one I saw. Killed him and the guy behind him.

Kept walking, turned a corner and saw another raider with a missile launcher. I only had the one missile, so I pulled out the hunting rifle and vats targeted his head. Missed and his rocket killed me instantly.

Then I just shut off my Xbox. Not out of rage, but because I was just done playing.

This is happening with every single game I play! Borderlands 2, Hitman, The Fallouts, Red Dead, Skyrim! Every single game I have put in, I only play for a half hour at the most, then I just turn it off and look for something else to do.

I had found 30 dollars a couple days ago, and I was so excited because I would finally be able to buy Scribblenauts Unlimited. It's been two days and I can hardly play it anymore.

I just get bored and go look to do something else. But I have nothing else to do! I started going through the games I bought on Steam and had never played.

I started playing Lone Survivor today, had to start over from where I was before cause I fucked up and used up all of my shit, and in less time I got way farther than I was before. Then I just stopped playing again.

I think MMO's might have ruined other games for me. I would think that not playing them anymore would be an easy cure, but it has so far not worked. I cancelled my WoW subscription, and haven't even played it in a month, and I'm playing a little f2p swtor, but that's only with my friend Courtland, so I think it's alright for me.

I was discussing all of this with Frank, which is why I decided to come here. He recommended that I start playing very simple flash games, stuff that doesn't have plot or thinking parts. Stuff on Kongregate, Sanctum, stuff like that.

But, I was enjoying Lone Survivor. I don't think it's the fact that I'm thrown away by plot and shit, I think I just don't want to play the same stuff that I already went through over and over again. Hitman got there through a single playthrough on account of how many times I had to restart checkpoints.

That's why I'm so eager to spend what little money I have on new games. Because it's something new that I can play and don't have to worry about getting bored with it, because something new is right around the corner.

I don't know what to do, so I have come to all of you and ask, what is wrong with me? I used to be able to play a game for an entire day. Is it Gaming Fatigue,  a condition that I just made up? I just want help is all. Thanks.

* Popular game series without IS include Halo, Half Life, Counter Strike, Team Fortress and others. Do you think these games avoid IS due to tradition? Or maybe its a conscious game decision affecting gameplay?

Give a little review on them!",,185,26,246,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/k8wmg/what_are_some_games_that_you_feel_not_enough/,"Allow me. Mount and Blade: Warband. I've been a gamer since I was born. Born the year the Nintendo was released. I have hundreds of favorites but this game is easily in my top 3. I have yet to talk to anyone IRL who has even heard of it. Anyone who is a fan of medieval warfare needs to get this game ASAP.

I started immediately in Multiplayer and sunk hundreds of hours having long, personal skill based sword fights with people. It's something that feels weird at first but once it clicks in and you get good at it, no game will make you feel more like a total medieval badass. The combat system is so genius but simple. For attacking, twitch the mouse in the direction you wish to swing, and left click. For blocking, twich the mouse in the direction of the incoming blow and right click. It's a very reflex intensive game where you're frantically trying to block attacks and deliver your own. There are tons of weapons: Axes, swords, maces, polearms, bows, crossbows, throwing weapons, lances.. Tons of armor. the horse riding mechanics are great, too.

I recently got into singleplayer and I was just floored by how deep it was. You start as one man on the world map.. you pick your faction and work your way up by recruiting peasants from taverns and ranking them up through field combat. you get money through trading, tournaments, looting enemy villages, taking enemy generals as prisoners and waiting for a ransom and many other ways. You can take a castle for yourself, defect from your chosen faction and start your own and become the King. There's castle seiges, romance (you can woo a lady and build up your relationship with her, and eventually marry her), politics.. There are several vassals per faction and you can have independent relationship levels with each one.. 

Really, there's just so much and I feel like I'm rambling. The game is simply amazing and so far the friends I've shown it to have been PO'd at me for their new addiction. It's on sale pretty often (i paid 5 bucks for it, my brother paid 10. it's usually 30.) and honestly, it'd even be worth it if the game was $59.99. with some tweaking, it runs great on lower end machines. It's not the most beautiful looking game but it's not bad looking. Truthfully, i'll take semi-good looking graphics and 200 v 200 man fights over cutting edge graphics and lagging out with that many units.

In this game I had probably my most badass online gaming moment ever.. 100 vs 100. Long fight, just me left on my team. They had 8 guys coming across the field at me. I was on fire with blocks and took them out one by one even though I was surrounded. When I won the round, voice chat lit up ""THAT'S HOW YOU FUCKING MELEE IN THIS GAME! FUCKING RIGHT!"" and people were going crazy. I felt like William goddamn Wallace (minus the ending.)

So, does anyone else know of any often overlooked games?

tl:dr - Mount and Blade: Warband, coming from a life long gamer, may be one of the best games ever created. If you like user skill based combat systems where pure skill can turn an impossible situation around, it is definitely an A+ game. Kick ass multiplayer with up to 100 vs 100 (biggest server I saw) with single player battles being as big as 200 vs. 200. It has a deep ""conquer the world"" singleplayer that has too many awesome features to count. Play it!

Edit: Damn! This blew up while I was at work. I'm both happy and ashamed to admit I haven't heard of a lot of these games. Where was this thread when my video card died and I needed oldschool games that run with onboard?! All these reviews are great and I officially want to play too many games right now.

[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/elderscrollsonline/comments/15y6zp/eso_weekly_race_restrictions_how_do_you_feel/) thread/video is what got me thinking about it.

The thing that set me off was how in the video they talk about if someone wanted to be a Nord mercenary for another faction, 100 other people will have the same idea. They call this a problem with the reasoning that ""it's an MMO."" That statement in of itself shows some preconceived notion that MMO's need to be restrictive. It's basically saying that they need to follow this cookie cutter MMO pattern just to be on the safe side.

My main point is, I saw some people disagree with what he said in the video in the comments of that thread, and the video talks about someone on the ESO forums vying for less race restrictions. But how much do you think the developers will actually listen and adapt to how fans want the game to be? Are they going to make the game that they want to make or are they going to make the game that the fans want? Or, do you think those are one in the same?


Above is the post I submitted to /r/elderscrollsonline but I'd like the discussion here to be about MMO's in general, and leave my Elder Scrolls as just an example of MMO restrictions. I'll give a few more mini examples to get the ball rolling.

In my opinion, this problem started when everyone tried to get off on WoW's success. WoW did the MMO right, and other companies have seen that and tried  to mimic it. I was really excited for SWTOR, but even that restricted where you could actually go even more so than WoW. Guild Wars 2 was another one I was really excited about, but in my opinion pvp was restrictive to the extent that it's only in certain set apart zones. But I was a WoW world pvp junkie, so maybe I'm biased on that.

Now, before I begin I just want to mention that I will not judge the games as Fallout games (i.e. not  by the standards of the Fallout series), simply because I have never played Fallout 1 or 2 from beginning to the end. I despise turn-based combat, and while the atmosphere and story were amazing in both those games, it's not enough for me.

I will do this comparison on 2 different categories- Gameplay (both RPG and FPS elements are included here) and Atmosphere (which includes the story, visual design,  etc.).

*Gameplay- Well there isn't much to compare here. Both had very solid RPG, but NV added a skill (Survival) and brought back traits. In addition, the FPS was slightly tweaked in NV with the added iron sights. I have heard people complain that this makes it too much of an FPS, but I think this just make it a better FPS, and seeing how it's an FPS-RPG, I don't see the problem with making it easier to aim.
There is also the redundant Hardcore mode, that was supposed to make it easier to role play, but really just meant you had to drink, eat and sleep once in 3 days or so (anything past that meant death. Anything before, however, meant pretty much nothing).
So NV's gameplay is kind of the same, only with some minor tweaks.

*Atmosphere- Here the games truly are different. The atmosphere, you see, reflects the **Main Themes** of the games. The main theme of Fallout 3 is *survival* in a hostile environment, while the main theme of NV is just politics. Yes, there are politics in Fallout 3 (the BoS-Enclave war), but they too center around survival- control over water supplies. In NV, they center around control, period- whoever controls the Hoover Dam controls the Mojave Wasteland and it's inhabitants, but there is still enough un-irradiated to go around, independent settlements are doing fine and there's a shiny fucking **Casino Strip** in the middle of it all.
Now, let me ask you something- which is the better theme for a post-apocalyptic game?
This is why I like Fallout 3 more. Many people complained that it's too depressing, bleak and lifeless, but that's what a post-nuclear wasteland supposed to be. That's the reason for the very small settlements, the green skies and the murky water. In Fallout 3 you feel the hardships of everyone around you, you see that they need help. That's where the main story comes in- your initial mission is to find your dad, but after that it's to give clean water to everyone, to help the **Survive**. In NV you don't get that feel. You get political tension, you get corruption, but I don't see those things fitting in a post-nuclear setting.

Don't get me wrong, I loved NV. But if I compare the two, it boils down to minor tweaks vs. one of the best game atmospheres in recent memory.

So, I hope that my point's clear. What's your opinion? Which game do you think is better and why?",,False,,t5_2sgq6,False,,,True,t3_w21k3,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/w21k3/fallout_3_vs_fallout_new_vegas/,

It deals with three fairly recent RTS games: Red Alert 3, Dawn of War 2, and SC2. It talks about the different approaches taken to their multiplayer browsers and community support, and the differing fates of their competitive scenes.

Red Alert 3:

While unjustly maligned by some, I believe RA3 to be an excellent game. Although it had been nearly two years since I played it, I can still clearly recall specific multiplayer games of spectacular intensity. RA3 had many triumphs to trumpet: a seamless incorporation of naval combat, an excellent in game UI , a diverse and fun cast of units, and an excellent division of micro and macro. To elaborate on the last two points, every unit in RA3 had an ability. No unit was an ordinary, boring point and click, and no unit was a frustrating caster with 4 or 5 different spells. Also, while expanding was vital in RA3, the use of a single resource and a single worker per expansion meant that you did not have to mindlessly build up workers for the entire game. The net effect at upper levels of play was an incredibly dynamic, fun, and well paced game with constant skirmishing and few dull moments. Yes, there were bugs and balance issues, but these could have been ironed out.

Yet they were not. The support for RA3 has been dismal. Game breaking exploits are rife and are not fixed. Imbalanced strategies are found and never patched. And this is not even the most frustrating part of the RA3 online experience.

No, that would be the frustrating and incomplete Gamespy multiplayer browser that abrogates any merit the game might have had. Let's just list a few of its failings:

   1. You have to leave the game and go to another website to initially sign up for multiplayer.
   2. Custom games list is populated based on the random chat channel you are placed into at login.
   3. A near total lack of useful chat commands and features.
   4. Automated matchmaking has few options and is quite bad.

Basically, I would describe the situation as this: RA3 is a delicious Red Lobster Cheddar Bay Biscuit. Gamespy is a thin layer of shit covering it. No matter how good that biscuit is, it's fucking ruined by that tiny amount of shit. It's a damn shame too. It's as if EA went to all the trouble of dressing in nice suit for a job interview, but then decided to wear socks and sandals. And without even matching socks. Basically, it made the game a chore to play, and is the primary reason I and many other gave up RA3 early despite its promise. It is entirely unacceptable that RA3's multiplayer browser did not even reach feature parity with RA2's! The fundamental message here is that you CANNOT and MUST NOT market out your multiplayer browser to a third party! It is the means by which your game's players will interact with the game every day. Many players will spend as much or more time in it as they will playing the game itself! It is absolutely vital that the integration be well thought out and seamless.

Dawn of War 2:

Dawn of War 2 is near and dear to my heart. I was one of the best DoW2 players in the world, and have literally hundreds of hours spent playing this game and its expansions. It gave me much joy, but even I admit that it is in many ways a disappointment and a failure.

This is what multiplayer DoW2 could have been: A game taking the innovative gameplay, sheer scope, and cinematic spectacle of Company of Heroes and transplanting it from WWII to the more diverse and faster paced setting of WH40k. There is literally no setting in existence more suited to huge scale cinematic combat than WH40k, which is why having the multiplayer be focused on small squad based micro battles was a travesty.

Yet I still loved the game for what it was and played it faithfully for years. Still, even for what it was DoW2 had too many flaws that it took too long to address (or were never addressed at all), which has caused its slow death.

First, the in game UI is rather clunky. The space bar does nothing, for instance. Tooltips are vague and misleading, and mechanics are complicated and hidden. The game is filled with odd bugs and idiosyncrasies, such as certain buffs stacking in odd ways to give unintuitive results. Many of these problems have been known since release, and have, in fact, been addressed numerous times by third party modders. Yet Relic, the makers of the game, fail time and again to do the simple data entry it would take to fix them for the wider game.

Also, the game's support for custom maps and mods is just plain awful. Both must be downloaded and installed manually, and mods must be activated through command line tags on a shortcut to the .exe. In short: the average player will never use one. This blunder is especially despicable since Relic itself proved the game's capacity for fun mods with the addition of The Last Stand game mode. A better integration of custom mods and maps could have lent the game much life.

But the third and most damaging error is the same as that made in RA3: Relic farmed out one of the most important parts of their game, the multiplayer interface, to a third party. In the beginning, this was Games for Windows Live. GFWL dealt a crippling blow to in-game fun and community. For instance, if you wanted to message someone to play, you had to go into a separate, stark white GFWL interface and essentially send them a pseudoemail. Even when it worked, it was slow and aggravating. It also meant that Relic couldn't patch their own game without coordinating with Microsoft. It drove off droves of players for years before Relic finally had had enough.

With the advent of the Retribution expansion, Relic switched over to Steamworks. This was a marked improvement from GFWL, yet it still remains clunky, buggy, and frustrating because it is an ungracious attempt to marry two entirely different systems. You can't, for instance, invite someone in game to your game without first adding them as a friend through the steam friends UI. Thus every attempt at arranging a match is circuitous and frustrating. Furthermore, when Steam servers go down for maintenance (frequently), every single person's current game is ended and they cannot make a new one. This makes no sense at all since the games are played P2P, and the only reason Steam servers are ever needed are for matchmaking and score reporting...

Today the DoW2 multiplayer scene is largely dead and almost entirely unsupported except for the occasional cash grab cosmetic DLC. A sad state of affairs for a game that might have combined the illustrious legacies of both the DoW and CoH series.

Starcraft 2: Starcraft 2, also, was a disappointment to me. I found the decision to split the campaign into separate expansions by race appalling, and overall found the game to be far, far too similar to Brood War.

That is, I wanted something revolutionary, what I got was basically Brood War with a modern UI and unit AI. In fact, from certain design standpoints I thought the game was a step backward. Various nuanced and interesting units were replaced with far more boring and straightforward ones (reavers vs collosi). A number of interesting unit interactions were wiped out with no real replacements, and the focus on the macro game was taken to a ridiculous extreme.

And yet SC2 is a great success, and I these days I find myself playing it almost exclusively. In fact, I would say that for those craving competitive RTS, SC2 is really the only game in town.

Why? Because Blizzard has supported its game excellently. When exploits are found, they are hotfixed immediately. When people complained about shortcomings in the functionality of the ingame chat interface and custom games interface, Blizzard obliged with a revamp. Blizzard's observer, casting, and replay tools are absolutely unmatched. Their community interaction both online and through live events is similarly unparalleled.

In short, even if I find the overall game design concept to be a rather dull rehash, SC2 is polished to a gleam. RA3 and DoW2, on the other hand, had a few strong innovations drowned in a glut of minor shortcomings. In the end, when I want to cut down a tree I will take a honed and sturdy axe over a rusted and ungassed chainsaw.

tl;dr RA3 and DoW2 had a number of innovations and great ideas, and could have been genuinely great with better support and a decent multiplayer UI. Lacking both, both failed to maintain strong multiplayer communities. SC2, on the other hand, has grown and continues to grow prodigiously despite containing few gameplay innovations because of strong and sustained developer support.

He's in his mid-60s, I'm in my late 30s. We're playing Borderlands 2 together (he's playing as a Gunzerker).

His last exposure to gaming was the Atari 2600 in the early 80s, and his level of comfort with technology is generally fairly low (he hasn't had to keep up even at work, due to the industry he works in).

As a result, he has a lot of visual language to catch up on. Some of those I could kind of see coming - menuing systems are tough, and easily gets lost in interfaces when there is a visual or navigation metaphor (multiple levels of navigation, or things that move around on the screen).

So Borderlands 2 was probably a terrible game to pick as a jumping off point, but having said all that he's coming along fairly well so far and enjoying it immensely. At this point he's probably logged 15 or so hours in the game. He's getting used to the controller but is still overwhelmed by the amount of information coming at him through the screen.

I think the information overload part will get better over time, but the thing we're really struggling with right now is his spatial perception. If we get into a set piece and he picks a static position for a firefight, he does fairly well. He can track and hit enemies and hide behind cover.

However, if he turns around or moves in three dimensions, he's lost. I've tried a few learning sessions to teach him how to find me and quest objectives on his map, but he seems to struggle meshing together the positioning information available through maps and what the game environment layout is.

For example, if he sees on the mini-map that he needs to run east to find me, but I happen to be standing at the top of a cliff that he needs to run around and find a path up, he really gets stuck. On a related note, he has trouble recognizing game surroundings...so we've run through Liar's Berg over and over again, but each time he thinks it is a different town.

So Reddit...has anyone else tried to teach an elderly or technophobic friend or relative to game? Any help or tips on building spatial awareness in a 3D environment would be appreciated.

(Oh and if you want to ask questions, please fire away....some of my Dad's in-game commentary is pretty funny.)

tl;dr - I need help teaching my Dad how to think in three dimensions in Borderlands 2. I'm looking for tips.

Games with exemplary dialogue trees off the top of my head are the Planescape: Torment, Mass Effect games, Dragon Age: Origins, Telltale's The Walking Dead game, Alpha Protocol had some really good dialogue trees too.

Anyway back to Fallout 1 &amp;amp; 2. The first time I realized how powerful dialogue trees can be in video games is when I rescued Tandi from the Raiders without resorting to violence. 

Then there is just about every bit of New Reno in Fallout 2, from being an all star boxer to becoming a porn star, that city in Fallout 2 had just about everything that makes a town in an RPG enjoyable to visit.

From the moment your car gets stolen to the moment you sleep with John Bishops wife and daughter then assassinate him for Roger Westin. Or finding Pretty Boy Lloyd hiding in the basement of the Desperado casino. Every playthrough of New Reno is different each time.

I also enjoyed some of the ""puzzle"" elements from Fallout 1 &amp;amp; 2, using a seemingly useless item in your backpack such as a rope on that seemingly useless thing in the world that's probably just there for set dressing such as a well. Mix the two, and you have yourself a way to get to the bottom of the well. Or being able to break down locked door.

That is to say, why must we brand all forms of media (paintings, movies, books, games, etc.) under this overwhelming word? Sure, we can compare aspects of one thing to another and determine how ‘good’ something is based on individual, and possibly gestalten, aspects, but why must we go further? There are already such things as classics, where products have stood the test of time and can still be enjoyed today, but this does not necessarily classify something as ‘art’.

To clarify, as seen [here](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/art-definition/#Con), the definition of art is by no means concrete and can probably be interpreted by each person to fit their own arguments. However, in my opinion, the use of the word ‘art’ is used nowadays as an umbrella term for products that are superior to others.

To label a product as art is to attempt to give that product a greater value, but this seems to benefit the select few and ostracize others. How does this benefit the medium or further discussion on the subject? I assume people want gaming to be viewed in a more ‘mature’ light when trying to label a game as art, but to do so seems unhelpful and limiting by the implication that to be ‘art’ is a good thing.

1359583646.0,159,self.truegaming,17l67a,Pre-CU SWG vs EVE economy,taroth,205,46,103,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/17l67a/precu_swg_vs_eve_economy/,"I know there must be some thoughtful Pre-CU (a game-altering patch) Star Wars Galaxies vets and EVE players on this subreddit. I was hoping we might engage in a discussion of **what makes the economies of these two very different games so amazing and how they compare to each other**. I'll start with a summary of why I think the Pre-CU SWG economy was fantastic:


**Players from the ground up**

In SWG, every item you would ever use was player crafted. Missions gave currency/xp. NPCs would drop trash loot, currency, and components that would be used in item creation. Rare, powerful creatures would drop rare, powerful item components (sometimes leading to server-famous weapons!). Acting as a solo player was totally viable as buying items from other players was easy and transparent.

**Item diversity**

Every resource (and item component) in the game was given a set of ""characteristics"" with random values between 1 and 1000. For example, a piece of tin might have 200 malleability, 523 heat resistance, and 800 conductivity. These characteristics would determine the quality of the item produced. The crafting system allowed for something called ""experimentation"" allowing crafters to risk their crafting materials to produce a potentially amazing item or fail miserably. The best crafters on the server were those who acquired clothing that allowed for even riskier experimentation and had access to the best materials. Every item was unique, and the crafter's name was inscribed on the item.

**Industry**

When a powerful item was produced, the crafter had the option to either make the item or turn it into a blueprint. The crafter could then take that blueprint to a factory (a player building) and with identical resources pump out up to 1000 copies of that item. As you can imagine, a top tier blueprint supported by an industrial chain of resources made some guilds/crafters incredibly powerful and wealthy.

**Resource competition** 

Resources would spawn every two weeks or so with an entirely new set of characteristic values. When a rich spawn was scouted (there were players who did exclusively this), everyone who knew about it would swarm the location with harvestors, which allowed for 24/7 automated resource extraction if you could grab the land. What was a worthless spawn a week ago could suddenly become the most valuable spot on the server. 

**Endless demand**

All items suffered permanent decay. Meaning that no matter how powerful the item you produced, it would eventually be unrepairable. Players complained about this all the time, but it was super important. When anti-decay kits were introduced in the CU, every server economy suffered massive inflation and nearly crumbled. Item decay kept SWG's economic wheels turning. Players were always on the lookout for good spawns and powerful item component drops.

**Trading opportunities**

Ambitious players established player cities, which were filled largely with player houses. If you were a Merchant (or were on business terms with one), you could station NPC shopkeepers to sell goods. I have fond memories of browsing through these virtual malls where people payed millions of credits for plots of land closest to the nearby starport. You could find virtually anything if you looked far and wide enough. The universal Bazaar (auction house) was limited to items beneath 6000 credits, so sophisticated trade was done through non-anonymous trades. Traders would make fortunes by buying materials at low prices on outer rim worlds from miners or their NPCs then selling them to crafters in the inner rim.

**Player interdependence**

The last point I'll leave on, and the point I particularly hope an EVE player responds to, is the deep connectedness of the SWG economy on a personal level. I played a Doctor, which means I played the role of infusing combat players with ""buffs"" so they could fight the toughest monsters. Players would pay me 22k credits a pop for my buffs, and often I would have repeat customers who knew me and tipped me extra. Instead of crafting my own buffs, I bought the consumable from a doctor that focused on high-quality blue print production and manufacturing. He stocked his factories with materials from an Artisan who focused on extracting the best resources. The Artisan had a few Scout buddies who found the top current spawns. The Scouts bought their buffs from me. Every player existed in dozens of these economic loops, whether they realized it consciously or not. Servers were medium sized (10,000 players per server) so everyone knew of and was connected to each other in some shape or form (""Oh you're the guy who makes rare carbines for the Rebels, cool!""). What came through was the feeling of being immersed in a living, dynamic world. 

Excelling in the SWG economy was more than just maximizing your margins, it was *building connections with good people*. That is was what made it great.

I'd like to hear about EVE. From a distance, it seems deeper on some levels but more superficial on others.

It was like what if an 8-bit point and click adventure game somehow got an animation budget that was through the roof and decided to make the most smooth moving animated bit game in the world.

However it made me wonder, is the pixel aesthetic something that is universally appealing to the eye regardless of what era of gaming you are born into or start with?  In some ways it could have a loose association with hand drawn animation.  This is more apparent when we enter the realm of licensed games and such.  However is it because there is something fun in just seeing animation in general that appeals to us rather than just seeing motion?  

Does the simplicity of the visual make it easier for us to process the sprite and thus enjoy whatever it does a bit more?  Perhaps especially when it forces us to engage our imagination to fill in the rest of the design.  It sort of reminds me of art especially when it came down to minimalism and impressionism where had there been a more detailed or complicated representation of the subjects, they would be far less engaging.  However with that said, is there an actual scientific article on whether or not we have a natural appreciation for the minimal aspects such as this or even a game related article that explores this idea?

As we all know sniping has evolved in gaming into almost the exact opposite of what it really is in the real world. I am not saying that this is a bad thing but it has happened. In most FPS games ie. Call of Duty, Halo, snipers are running full speed around maps ""quick scoping"" massive amounts of people in very odd situations. Who would have thought that a sniper rifle would replace a shotgun for CQC? 

I have always been a fan of shooters and sniping, especially of the WWII genre as well as stealth action games with games like Chaos Theory ranking as one of my all time favorites. I have to say this game is the first game in a long time to me that really feels intense and satisfying. 

Other sniping games have come out and they have been more or less flops such as Sniper: Ghost Warrior. In an honest opinion a ""true"" sniping video game would not be fun to play because that would be someone sitting at their screen for hours to days on end killing very few individuals and would probably be too hard to actually play for the common person. 

What I feel this game does is find that very nice balance of sniping mechanics and well paced action. What i mean by sniping mechanics are the things that make you feel like you are sniping, and not just using a bolt action assault rifle. For starters there is bullet drop and wind, nothing knew to the table but important, especially the wind. Games like Battlefield3 have bullet drop but don't account for wind. Second is the heart rate mechanic and how it works. In most other games you can sprint full speed, stop, hold your breath and head shot all day, rinse repeat. This game when you sprint and run around your heart rate increases to either reduce time spent holding breath and increasing scope drift, or if you run to much, disables the ability to hold your breath until you rest and calm down. I think that this is such a small, but important mechanic when designing a sniper based game.

The cover mechanic works well allowing for stealth and strategy to come into play. Being able to survey the area and set up the shots you need, or stay quiet in buildings adds to the atmosphere of that you are a one man elite sniper who will be overwhelmed if you are not smart about what you do, which is also something important to have in a sniping based game. 

The slow motion kill shots I personally think are great and they seem to trigger the right amount, if maybe just a little too often but not by much. The reason these shots are great to have in a game like this is it makes your shots gratifying and rewarding. Shooting through someones jaw and seeing the bone explode and shatter, and then seeing the stumped bullet exit the head is just so amazing to see because that was the shot you just did. A personal favorite has been shooting a grenade on a solider and watching him slowly evaporate to it, only for the camera to quickly zoom back out and all you can see is the smoke from the explosion. 

These are just my impressions on the game, and it is just the demo and after playing the demo I will be buying the game. I would love to hear what other people thought this game did right, or wrong as well but overall I am very excited for what this game is doing and even if it is not a amazing success, will hopefully set things in motion for further development of games like this.

I've owned Deus Ex since the last Steam Summer Sale, but never got around to playing it. I later got DE:HR and played through that so I thought it was about time I took a crack at Deus Ex.

Before even really getting into it I installed New Vision, Deus Exe and HDTP, which made the game graphically decent given its age. 

Firstly, I've gotta say that the game was hard to get into. The controls made me hate it for the first parts of it. I hadn't realized how somewhat standardized controls had gotten until I kept trying to zoom the sniper rifle and instead tossing it in the air. Eventually I got used to the controls and things went fairly smoothly, although I wish the flashlight wasn't F12.

So the story, holy hell. The plot had twists and turns without becoming nauseating or predictable. Looking back on it, a whole lot happened in the game and it was all tied together without feeling linear or out of place. Honestly the story alone is worth its weight in gold. 

The one thing that really surprised me is how this game came out before 9/11. I'll admit, being only 23 my pre-9/11 politics are hazy, but the whole idea with FEMA and using it to do what they did (trying to not let any spoilers out) really was something I didn't think was possible pre-9/11. I just recall being blown away by some of the future predictions they made, and also scared how some seem much more viable and realistic than they should. 

For some comparison with Human Revolution, I think that HR really stuck with the ability to do things multiple ways without penalty and I feel that both games do emphasize stealth, but it isn't necessary. I felt that Deus Ex was a harder game though, and along with that more frustrating at times.

And I understand that ""evil"" in Bioware games is usually meant more along the lines of ""douchebag"" or such. Anyway...

Over the weekend I decided to do something I'd never tried before: play an ""evil"" character in an Elder Scroll game (Skyrim,  in this case). I figured that hey, why not? It's an open world, right? I can do whatever I want!

But despite hearing bits and pieces over time of folks who have successfully ""played bad"" in this game, I'm just not seeing those options available - unless ""bad"" in Skyrim means little more than ""kill everyone.""

I've played Bad Guys before in games, usually made by Bioware. I did multiple runs through the KotORs as a Sith, a total bag of dicks in the Mass Effect games, and a straight-up hard-ass in Dragon Age. Yes, not all of the ""bad"" options were meant to be pure evil, it was good that they were there.

Even Fallout 3 did an okay job giving me bad-guy options: blow up megaton, join the slavers, help the ""vampires,"" etc. I'm so far not getting the feeling that there are any real ""bad guy"" options in Skyrim that amount to anything more than just who I choose to kill. With most quests, the only choices I really seem to be given are ""yes I will help you"" and ""sorry I'm busy.""

I really like the open world wandering around in Skyrim. It's about 90% of why I play it. I don't think it really makes playing ""bad guys"" all that possible, though, outside of ye olde standby by pickpocketing and/or murdering everyone I encounter.

To me, Super Smash Bros. has always been at its best when all the stochastic elements are removed, allowing 2-4 players to simply beat on each other without a falling star, maximum tomato, or home run bat to turn the tide.

[Spoilers],evlutte,226,72,93,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/13gn90/what_did_you_think_about_the_ending_of_prince_of/,"I just finished playing through the 2008 reboot of Prince of Persia. I thought it was a decent game overall, but that's neither here nor there. What really intrigued me was the ending. For those interested who haven't played the game, the entire game is spent running around the world and healing ""corrupted"" areas to stop a dark god from escaping. This is done with the aid of magic-powered princess who does the healing and helps you (the prince) out of difficult situations. There's the expected bantery romance etc. After completing all areas, you return to seal the dark god in the temple. It turns out (surprise surprise) that the princess must sacrifice her life to seal the god away. The credits scroll as you carry the princess' body out of the temple. 

The game then *continues* as visions from the dark god flash before your eyes and he whispers that he will bring the princess back to life if you free him (echoing the temptations of earlier characters in the game). You--or perhaps it is better to say ""the prince""--succumb to the temptation and deliberately spend the last few minutes of the game destroying the seals you created and undoing everything you accomplished over the course of the game, dooming the world to save the princess.

I thought that this was a fascinating ending, if a bit jarring. It completely takes narrative control from the player while retaining gameplay control. You don't watch a cutscene in which the prince undoes everything, you do it yourself, but it's the only way to ""finish"" the game. Alternately you could declare the game finished (you've accomplished all the challenges) and turn it off, but we as gamers are trained not to do that.

Personally I would have liked a hidden second choice of suicide (since the princess who always saves you from falling is dead now), but I guess that wasn't what the designers wanted. Overall the ending felt like it a surprising, even jarring amount of depth added to an otherwise deceptively shallow/lighthearted game.

But I'm pretty sure each one of us has our limits - certain things that will make us dislike and stop playing a game because it's just too bad to continue.  Here are some of mine:

- **Taking control away from the player** - I don't mean cutscenes. I'm totally fine with those. I'm talking about games that deliberately take control away from the player in times where it's needed. By far the biggest offender here is Lost Planet, with Dead Rising 1 and 2 being a close runner up. In Lost Planet, if you get shot with some kind of rocket, you get knocked over. The amount of time it takes you to get up is absurd, and by that time you're being shot with another rocket. This all too often ends with the player being shot until they die. Total dealbreaker - could not play that game anymore. In Dead Rising, it's the same kind of thing - zombies and bosses grab you and knock you over so constantly that you feel like the game is just stealing health from you rather than you're not skilled enough at it.

- **Difficulty spikes** - Sometimes I tolerate these just fine. Prototype is a good example - it became really hard at times, but it never became unfair. A big offender here, though, is Deus Ex: Human Revolution's boss fights. That game's bosses are not only unfair, they're poorly designed, not taking into account what kind of character the player has. I went full on stealth and didn't outfit myself with shock resistance at all - so the second boss that shocks the floor? Near impossible to defeat. I had to exploit a glitch where she froze in place and shoot her in the face with a shotgun over 2 dozen times. Unbelievable.

- **Poorly placed or non-existent checkpoints** - Dead Rising. Dead Rising. Dead Rising. Rarely does a game so utterly fail at this like Dead Rising and its fun but lazy sequel. It doesn't even restart you at the beginning of boss fights when you die - instead you have to fight your way back to them. Not fun at all.

I'm sure I'll think of more. But what about you guys?

I've been playing MP games on Steam for a while and found it tolerable, as it's one of the least painful MP DRM I've seen lately and I find its social features rather useful, if somewhat primitive. However, I don't understand why it's becoming the norm for single player games, nor why most players accept it. For SP games, Steam makes you bear with all its drawbacks while offering no real advantage in return, neither to developers (it's ineffective, as it's common knowledge that all offline-only big releases are hacked fully within a week) nor to players, as the social features that make Steam convenient for arranging and enjoying MP games are much less useful in SP.

[This thread's comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/l1tuq/so_what_dont_you_like_about_steam/) condense most of the flaws of Steam, but I'll summarize here the most important points for those of you who don't know what I'm talking about. Skip to the last paragraph if you've heard about this already:

1. A draconian EULA that allows Valve to shut down access to all your games for no reason whatsoever. In addition you lose all rights to a fair trial and have to resort to whatever arbitration procedure they choose if you have a problem with them. I'm sure this wouldn't hold in any European court of law, but it's unsettling to say the least.

2. You have to be online to activate and download the game, and to play it you must either be online at all times or make a goat sacrifice so that the hit-and-miss offline mode might work. 

3. Their official support is on the level of ATI/AMD: emails get ignored and support tickets get late and canned replies, so you must turn to the forums for help. Thankfully I've found them to be pretty helpful, but I shouldn't have to rely on my fellow players to get support, and there's not much they can do if your account gets locked.

4. Can't sell, rent, lend or return your game, as it's locked to your account for all eternity.

4. Automatic patch downloading. I always liked to play the game and then download any patches once I'm done, so they'll download and install while I'm doing other stuff. Not anymore.

5. You can't choose where to install the games without 3rd party tools, and mods sometimes refuse to work.

5. It's an extra point of failure. If for whatever reason Steam refuses to work, you're out of luck. 

6. Steam knows your PC specs, your email, your credit card number, what you've been playing and for how long. While I trust Valve, there's no reason why I should have to give any information at all to any company just to play an offline game. Oh, and they got hacked.

I know I'm going against the tide criticizing Steam here, but I'm not trying to ""troll"" or annoy people. I just want to understand why gamers mostly accept Steam for SP games instead of going thermonuclear as they would if it was Origin, though as far as I can tell both are pretty similar. Is it only because Valve is loved and EA hated (understandably, by the way) or is there something else that I'm missing?

/u/infinitedreamer asked the question ""is there a bias against women in gaming culture? If so, why does it exist?""

I myself made a point that I'll be posting as a comment for coherence's sake. This post is meant to start a discussion, not preach.

Setting aside the issue of that thread in particular and cosplay in general, we still need to look at the question ""does sexism pervade gaming culture?""

I don't think that the eye-candy argument is valid, simply because both men and women are much more attractive in games then in real life. Regarding the male gaze theory - that's a little more complicated. I personally don't like out of character overemphasized sexuality intruding on my games. It's bad design and it breaks immersion.

I'll use a superhero MMO as an example. (It could work with any premise where a protagonist attains a power that comes from within. See: the tv series Heroes, SMT: Persona games, X-men, etc.)

During character creation, you fill out an extremely detailed personality questionnaire (could be for yourself or RP), and the game generates a unique power/playstyle for you, according to the answers given. Let's say for the sake of discussion that the outcome will not fall under typical ""classes"" (every character will be unique enough to not feel that the assignment was gimmicky), and what you get is always going to be a balanced build. However, this set of skills assigned to your character cannot be changed, and you have to figure out a playstyle and make it work. Of course, there would be growth and attaining new powers with levels, etc, but the overall ""area of expertise"" of your toon remains unchanged.

I'm asking this because I think it'd be a nice initial challenge. I also feel that this would help the player connect with their character more.

For those of you that did play it, how did you feel about it?  It was a very different approach to a video game, in that you really don't have too much control of the game.  They take away things from you to force you to experience the game they wanted you to experience it.  Normally you're given many options about how to play a game, but they clearly had a vision about how they wanted it to go for everyone, and I kinda liked that.

The post linked to an image of the protagonist from Mirror's Edge, and was intended to show that not all women need to be so sexual in video games. The comments are overrun with complaints about how sexualized women are in video games, yet there were very few comments acknowledging that the same is true of men. Sure, the men aren't wearing revealing clothing, but I think the principle is the same. People went batshit over how sexualized all the female characters in Arkham Asylum/City are, but nobody mentioned that you could fit three of me inside Batman. Batman is ridiculously muscular and his clothes are just as tight as Catwoman's. In fact, the only difference between Catwoman and Batman is that Catwoman shows a bit of cleavage.

Even in less exaggerated games, the men are still the epitome of attractiveness. In the Uncharted series, Drake is extremely muscular and good-looking. Far Cry, same story. Mass Effect, same story. The list goes on.

Sure, the guys are probably not intended to make the player aroused since the target audience of these games is men. I'm not denying that. But the formula for this is the same as the formula for female pop singers--the guys all want to do you, the girls all want to be you. It's just the other way around. The guys in these games are idealized so that all the men wish they could be like them. What guy wouldn't want to be an attractive, assertive, muscular man who gets all the ladies?

Now, it sounds like I've just pointed out a huge problem. So where's the solution? Well, there isn't a solution because I don't think this is a problem. Video games aren't meant to show the world as it is--if they were, why would you play them when you could just experience the real world? They're supposed to be exciting and fun, and I'd much rather play as Nathan Drake with Elena Fisher around than as a fat slob and his overweight girlfriend. It's just the way it is.

Sure, some games *do* go over the top with the whole sex thing. If I feel like I need to jack off in the middle of playing the game before I can comfortably continue, it has gone too far. But having attractive females in somewhat revealing clothing and attractive males in whatever they will wear *adds* to the game. It makes it more fun. It shows me an alternate world where things are more idealized, and I like that.

With OOO, I fear that they will promise but never release an expected and hyped new addition, release a catastrophic and in-game economy breaking patch, then let the community rot and turn into dust as they did with Bang! Howdy. B!H was a fantastic game, but it was plagued by the Boomtown promise that never came true, the Wrangler Pass patch enraging the community and causing the in-game cash gold trading to be removed entirely, and the fact that they just plain stopped caring about us and moved on with Puzzle Pirates and Whirled (which also happened to have flopped or is at least stuck in perpetual beta since I last checked). Their previous actions are what's making me reluctant to try Spiral Knights, which seems to be a very good game, even if it is published by SEGA.

So how about you, why are you cautious of certain gaming companies? Which of their policies or actions make it so and why? ""EA IS SHIT CIRCLEJERKCIRCLEJERKCIRCLEJERK"" isn't an explanation. I wanna know what EA did to make you turn away.

For many years I played games until something else made me stop — I had to walk the dog, or it was time to eat dinner, or what have you. As a result, my progress in the game was right in the middle of a quest or challenge. Worse, sometimes I would stop playing whilst trying to overcome a really difficult level or puzzle. (I'm looking at you, *Super Meat Boy*.)

Recently I've come to realize that this pattern is the number one reason why I would abandon a game completely. (And sometimes feel like video games themselves are unappealing.) Why? Because whenever I consider that game, my memory is either:

* ""You're in the middle of a boring section. All the fun and excitement of that game are gone."" 

or

* ""NO! That game brings pain! It's aggravating and you get really mad. Remember when you hurt your hand because you punched the wall after failing for the 739th time? Play something else!""

To rid myself of these thoughts, I've trained myself to play a few levels or do a few quests in a game, and then stop while I'm feeling good about my progress. 

Take *Hotline Miami*. It's tempting to just keep going after I finish a level. But chances are I will eventually reach a difficult bit and run out of time before I can conquer it. Instead, I'll clear a level or two and then stop while I'm still in that ""YES I am *unstoppable*"" mindset.

Now when I consider a game, my memory is usually:

* That game is tough and/or fun, but I'm good at it and there's such a thrill when I conquer a level. Let's play it!

The way I see RPGs, from my limited view, is that the main character's role can be classified into three sections:

* Absolutely central to the plot: The hero is usually ""The Chosen One"",  and usually ends up getting a lot of foretold prophecies about him/her. The main story happens due to his/her intervention with the world and its characters. More popular in RPGs with a single character controllable by the player

* Takes part in the story but is not central to it: The main character may just be a minor player in the story, but still has his/her importance in it. Instead, the overall arcs or the plot are given importance. Examples include ~~Morrowind~~ Oblivion and Dragon Quest V

* Not important to the story at all: The protagonist is a faceless avatar who only serves to be the device through which the story is told. More applicable to sandbox RPGs and action RPGs where plot is not the main attraction of the game.

I think that the plot should involve the main char in some way, but I'd like to see the overall consensus on which type of main character is preferred more in a game

Are there any decent ones you can recommend?,ch4rbok,222,71,256,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/17zp2a/where_did_the_exploration_platformer_go_are_there/,"Sitting here late at night, listening to the Banjo Kazooie soundtrack and thinking back on many an article I've written to articulate exactly how much I love the exploration platforming genre. Unfortunately it seems that the genre all but died with the N64, the last remnants of it being stomped out alongside the Gamecube and PS2.

This generation I don't think I've seen a single good exploration platformer, and the only somewhat passable game I can think of that even attempted the style was *Epic Mickey*. Unfortunately that series jumped the shark when they decided to make a sequel that was actually worse than the first game, and now the studio behind it has closed.

I guess a big part of the reason I'm posting this is because I'm hoping I'm wrong and you guys can recommend me some really awesome exploration platformers from the last few years that will take me to another world and allow me to explore it within the confines of its laws and boundaries.

And I know there are games like Skyrim and GTA that are open world and allow you to explore, but I'm looking for things more fantastical. Sort of like Zelda, but a platformer.

So basically Mario 64 or Banjo Kazooie or Spyro or any of those types of games. Are they really just part of a dead genre?

**edit**: I really appreciate all the game suggestions guys, but Metroidvania doesn't really hit the spot for this sort of thing. There are plenty of those around still! :(

They aren't really immersive in the same respect and they don't feel very open-world to me. Part of the reason I list Mario 64/Banjo/Spyro is because the somewhat whimsical and colorful nature of the games is a large part of the reason why they feel so immersive to me. I'm definitely looking for something more like that, if it exists!

**edit 2:** A big part of the exploration platformer is having a small number of really dense levels that you return to over and over and over again. You can explore just fine in a Metroidvania game or a Mario Galaxy game, but you don't form the same bond with the levels because there's not a lot of backtracking/residual exploration that you do on your 20th, 30th, or 40th visit to a level. And on top of that, most Metroidvania games don't have ""levels"" in the traditional sense, which make forming bonds to areas even harder.

It just struck me the other day playing Halo 4 on Legendary and dying a LOT - every time I fall off a cliff, get instagibbed, or get plain lazy and rush...humanity loses.

It's over, done, goodbye, the big bad gets to carry out his wishes. As the last man in the fight, my death signifies the defeat of mankind
until I spawn back, good to go. How do I want to attempt it this time? Go back for more ammo and scrounge for weapons? Safe, but boring. Fuck it and huck it? That didn't work the last three times, and it's getting disheartening. Try to pick enemies off one by one? What if I miss one?

What happens when Mario gets eaten or falls in the Lava? Why don't we (outside of developer resources, of course) get to control the much less effective Toadstools? Why don't we get to make a break for it as Peach, in an intense escape/chase scene?

I know respawns are a necessary characteristic of a lot of games, but I feel like they aren't really dealt with quite right in a lot of cases, and it never really hit me until a while ago what a respawn really meant. In very few games that I've played(maybe I've played a bad selection?) my death means nothing but a slingshot back to a checkpoint.

I know one of Prince of Persia games took a lot of flack for this, as you literally couldn't die - time was just rewound and you tried again. I feel like this might have seemed cheap to a lot of players, but that might be because it makes plain a fact that is obscured in a lot of shooters - you ARE immortal. You're not a tactical genius in a SEAL team, you're a literal god among men that gets to try again.

Has anyone else thought about this? Does it bother you, or am I just picky?

Super Meat Boy sort of addresses this, if not directly: upon completion of a level, you see all of your failed attempts. It's incredible watching a horde of toons start out rushing, only to watch them fall by the wayside until one fortunate soul makes his way to the damsel in distress.

If you think about it, you can see the 'odds' of a genetically generated Meat Boy making it - you can see different approaches and paths attempted, varied, and eventually discarded paths, you can see successful paths that made it a bit farther down the road, and in some cases complete oddball paths that exploit mechanics in the game and do things drastically faster, but upon attempts in other situations fail miserably.
At the end, you could sum this up as a statistic and use it to rank maps, but in context of the story: 'In x universes, the DiD doesn't make it. Do you have what it takes?'

Could this mechanic be adopted by shooters, on a massive scale? Instead of Halo, where the ending is set, could we see community graded endings that run in seasons? Of course not 5 or 6, but an ODST type game where the ending is based on how many of your units survive?

If none of you make it, you're treated to an ending where you see Earth go up in smoke? If a few make it, you manage to accomplish your objective/save humanity, but you perish in the act? If most of your squad survives, you only lose a player or two in the ending act, and you go home to be lauded as heroes. This could even lead to a branching storyline where you can play different episodic content.

What if that's too hard for the casual gamer? Of course it would be, not everyone's into this. Hell, most gamers probably wouldn't be. So what if every once in a while, a new troop of ODSTS drops, and sticks with you, and you take control of them as you go? The bot ones would fall by the wayside more quickly, but if any players were hanging in limbo they could take over one of the Bots and it would become human, ALA CSGO.

I recently went back to Skyrim for a bit, picking up an old save file and returning to my old game, which I've logged about 60 hours into (which I know is relatively little, but that's beside the point). Now, as we all know, TES gives people the general freedom to do pretty much whatever they want. If you want to be evil and kill everyone, fine. If you want to complete the main quests because you're into narrative, great. If you want to grind at leveling up your smithing or magic powers so that you can craft better items or use better spells, go for it. All in all, the game really doesn't give people a strong sense of direction, but that's considered one of it's strong suits, and I consider it to be the reason that TES is a great series for showing you what sort of person you really are.

I put 60 hours into Skyrim, and barely did any quests. Why? Well, I spent most of my time simply wandering. Not kidding. I really enjoyed just wandering the wilderness, generally avoiding cities and people, and just appreciating the natural beauty provided by the game-world. Friends are always surprised to see how low of a level I am, but it's not like I'm really aiming for anything in particular; I haven't completed any main storylines, and really didn't aim for anything in particular in that game. I just went to that game to wander and be alone.

In what little I've played of Minecraft, it's the same way; I don't have a lot of direction pushing me to do anything in particular, so I don't get anything done. I just wander and explore, digging tunnels occasionally, but really so that I can explore underground. These open-world games for me aren't really telling me to do anything, so I just go off and be alone. I'm an introverted person, so that's reflected in how I play these games.

Games like Mass Effect are also considered great for the variety of choice they give you, but it doesn't do as good of a job reflecting who you are, and this is important. Mass Effect gives you choice, but choice and freedom are two different things (in the context of this subject). Choice is being able to choose one of several outcomes to a situation; freedom is being able to tackle the situation in any way you want. Mass Effect often presented the player with some heavy dilemmas, but in the end, your options were limited to what they give. While it might cause you to reflect on the ethics of particular situations, you weren't forced to reflect on your moral philosophy as a whole.

I know I'm only touching the surface of this, but I'm interested to hear what other people have to say on the matter. What games did a good job of allowing you to reflect who you really are as a person? What have you learned about yourself playing particular games? What games do these things particularly well, and why?",,False,,t5_2sgq6,False,,,True,t3_14lzm6,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/14lzm6/games_that_reveal_your_true_personality/,

I play video games to simply get away from the real world. The world is harsh sometimes, and when I need to get my mind off of it, I go to video games. Games don't tease you and call you names, and they make your mind focus on something completely different. I like platforming, action, and adventure games in particular, because it's a whole new world. Also it's because of this that I take sportsmanship so seriously in four player games. I feel like it defeats the point for me if people are just going to play games to prove something about themselves. I play for fun and the aforementioned reason.

In a discussion on this forum, somebody once pointed out to me that one of the problems with video game reviews is that they are just as much, if not more, product reviews than artistic critiques. That is, they spend more time on things like graphics, control schemes, etc than on artistic merit, or what the game is trying to say. In short, they more closely resemble reviews of toasters than of films.

I thought I would post this as a positive example, of how video game journalism *should* be. A few things I thought it did right:

1. It didn't dwell on gameplay. It is a military shooter, we all know what it is like. Any mentions of gameplay are in the context of individual sequences, as action scenes in movies would be discussed.

2. It is unfavorably compared to classics of film and literature. This may seem like a bad thing, but imagine somebody criticizing Doom in the context of Joseph Conrad. Unthinkable only recently, and a mark that video games are being held to higher artistic standards.

3. It is put within a specific cultural context. That is, games are being treated as an actual cultural artefact worthy of examination.

4. It is well written and treats its readers as intelligent, thoughtful, and willing to engage with a work. Imagine this being in an IGN review ten years ago:

&gt;In another evocative touch, Walker and his men sometimes sneak up behind soldiers and eavesdrop on their quotidian but humanizing banter before — and here the game gives you no choice — ending their lives.

&gt;In moments like these, Spec Ops is a thoughtful and harrowing contrast to the power fantasies of its competitors. But it is not confident enough, alas, to trust players with much subtlety. This is the kind of game that can’t let a few ravens pick at a nearby corpse without a character’s interjecting, “At least the ravens aren’t gonna starve.” The images of death and execution become tawdry with repetition.

The New York Times has quietly been putting out great reviews for some time now, but I thought this one was especially worthy of note.",,False,,t5_2sgq6,False,,,True,t3_vn24o,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/vn24o/fantastic_review_from_the_new_york_times_of_spec/,

I have been playing XCOM almost constantly when I get spare time since it released on the 9th. I am about to start my 6th game, having only beaten the game once on classic, and I've always noticed complaints about new games being ""Too hard"". Diablo 3 was a recent instance of this with Inferno mode, and I think the topic has a lot of potential to it.

Arguably, the difficulty is what draws people to some games. Dark Souls gets praised even though it's known for destroying controllers, and I bet not a lot of people actually finish it. People throw around phrases like ""Artificial Difficulty"" to excuse themselves from not playing it, and a lot of people ask ""How is this even fun?""

It seems to have spawned what a lot of people refer to as the ""casual"" games. Games that are easy enough that everyone can beat it, and not pose too much of a mechanical or intellectual challenge to the people who play it. 

In order for a game to present any real challenge, it will likely discount some of its potential audience from actually completing the game. Do you feel this is a bad thing? Should people who pay money for a game be entitled to beat it and finish its story? Have you come across a game that does both really well, if so, can you say how it did it?

However, it has come to my attention, both after reading feedback to Youtube playthroughs of the game, and my own experience within the game, that DayZ has an extraordinarily snobbish community. 

In terms of YT comments, a considerable number of videos have been bombarded with comments and dislikes from people saying that the video makers are ""playing the game wrong"" or are saying things like ""you are not playing DayZ correctly, please do not play it ever again"" (and that is putting it lightly). For the vast majority of other games, LPs which consist entirely of messing around are popular and well-recieved, see the stupidly large number of Minecraft LPs for proof of that. Why is DayZ the exception? It is of my belief that this phenomenon is endemic of a greater problem within the DayZ community: to put it bluntly, a lot of them are snobs, demanding that you play the game their way, or don't play it at all. 

While playing the game, this problem seems to be muted, though it is still definitely there. More than once I have been berated and downright insulted for ""not playing properly"". 

While this is certainly not the first game to attract such a community (MOBA/DOTA games certainly come to mind), it is certainly a lot more pronounced than those games are, at least from my experience.

So, what do you think? Do you agree? If so, what do you think has caused this phenomenon? Do you disagree? If so, why? What have I got wrong?

Do not mistake this statement as me disliking the game. I do not. I like it quite a bit.

EDIT: It seems that many people have stopped reading at the Youtube section, ignored the rest of the post, or otherwise have focused entirely on Youtube as a reason why I fail. First of all, yes, I understand that YT is not a pleasant place, but to entirely dismiss it, as many people in this thread are doing, is just as extreme as me supposedly basing my entire argument around it. Like it or not, there are a LOT of people on youtube, there are a lot of DayZ players on Youtube. Ignoring them is ignoring vast swathes of the community, and that makes for a weak and unhealthy argument.

Secondly, let me make this abundantly clear. I AM NOT BASING MY ENTIRE ARGUMENT AROUND YOUTUBE COMMENTS. PLEASE READ MY ENTIRE POST BEFORE YOU COMMENT.

Please do not make the assumption that I am basing my argument entirely around Youtube comments, that is blatantly wrong, and anyone who attempts to berate me using that argument is, by extension, wrong.",,False,,t5_2sgq6,1341787922.0,,,True,t3_w85u6,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/w85u6/dayz_a_community_of_snobs/,

1337794642.0,149,self.truegaming,u1alg,"It took me about 2 weeks to make, an app that retrieves every steam game, dlc, bundle offered. A little look into how steam works.",sevenalive,214,65,60,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/u1alg/it_took_me_about_2_weeks_to_make_an_app_that/,"It took me about 2 weeks time to make. This is a tool that I made because I needed a list of all the steam games. Well that doesn't exist in a format I could use. The steam store does not have any API's that allow you to retrieve it's information. This is a long read, but I wanted to give an in-depth look. Screenshots are at the bottom.

It's rare to find anything on the Steam CDR, at least on a web site you can find on google. When I was trying to find a way to get a list of games available on steam, I was lucky and came across something called the CDR. The CDR is the Content Description Record, it lists everything, and I mean everything. Language packs, demos, trailers, guides, content depots, and a slew of test apps. It was hosted on a website that gave no information, searching steam cdr got me nowhere. I got the feeling it was some secret underground thing that is used to pirate steam games, I still am not sure if it helps with that since I don't pirate games anymore.

I am aware of some sites that host the raw CDR, but trust me, the CDR is filled with every single thing belonging to steam and they don't bother filtering the data.

Now I hit quite a few problems making this app. The CDR is filled with IDs, I was only interested in the stuff you can buy and play. Some ID's are just store page redirects to the real id. The CDR doesn't list a lot of useful information, it doesn't list store information, it's just the information steam needs to download and run.

The CDR is split into 2 sections, apps and subscriptions. AppID's are tied to games and their content. Subscriptions can be anything, just like apps, but they are a bundle of more than 1 app. I believe they are also tied to MMO subscriptions, but I can't say for sure.

The CDR is actually on everybody's steam installation. It's inside the ClientRegistry.blob, once I knew about the CDR, it took me a lot of digging to find out where the information was coming from, I thought they pulled it from the steam store.

So my app reads that and loops through all the apps and subs. The first thing I do is check to see if my own database already has that record, so I can skip it. No need to process the stuff I already processed. I then do a simple filter by name. I exclude anything that says demo, beta, trailer, or that has regional tags like (FR) or (PEGI).

Once I got that that, the fun part comes. The only way to be sure I got something valid and not a redirect or a false bundle, is to load the store url, which I construct with the ID's given to me in the CDR. apps are /app/123456 and subs are sub/123456

First I create myself a cookie that says I am over 18, so I don't get redirected to the damn age gate. Then check and see if I got redirected for another reason, like a ID that redirects to other ID and page. I throw those out because they are duplicate items.

I also throw away stuff that isn't available in my region (U.S), most of that stuff is a duplicate entry anyway. I then use a few regular expressions to filters the html that I want. Since every bundle consists of apps, I check all the apps first. I get the price, check if it's a DLC item, check if it's free to play. I also check and see if that app can be bought individually on steam. For example, Breath of Fire &amp; Chutulu Saves the World VII is only sold in the pack, but they both have app store pages. For my purposes I don't care about those pages anyway, I only want the stuff you can buy and play.

There is also another issue of [false sub pages](http://store.steampowered.com/sub/70), see how it says 0 for individual price. I believe those are left over from when a game might have been sold in a pack but isn't anymore, or when the game can only be bought as part of a pack.

Alright so once I got all of the bad stuff out of the way, I get the price information for the apps and also check to see if it's a dlc item. For the subs, I count how many games are listed in the pack. I don't get the prices, since I already got them earlier with the apps. But I do check the price for each app in the bundle, because I need to calculate how many points it is worth for what I am doing. I don't count anything less than $1 or anything that you can't buy separately. The sub pages list those items as N/A, meaning you have to buy the pack if you want that game. Since I throw out the false app pages, it helps make sure the points I am calculating are accurate.

So once I got all my info for that ID, I move onto the next ID. Yes, the app goes to every game and bundle pages in the store. It doesn't even scratch the servers though. Plus since I am storing my parsed data and keeping track of what I throw out and keep, the app only needs to do that when it doesn't have it's database. So after the first run, it just continues along the loop for everything I already have. I only need to go to the steam page if it's something I don't know about. So it allows for fast and easy updates to the data for when new games are added.

Besides filtering and saving the useful data, it can also export the changes or everything to sql or a csv file. Now here is the downside, I can't share this app with everyone and because of that, I can't make it open source. I could distribute a prefilled database with the app, but if some people decide to delete it and have it run from scratch, that is a big problem. 1 person doing it is fine, 10 is fine, but not 500+ people doing it. That would be a bad situation and that is why reddit bans abusive bots, they can bring down a site. There wouldn't be any reason I can think of to delete the database. I have the ability to exclude, include items. I plan on implementing an re-check function so I can re-check the item, see if it still exists, and get the latest retail price. Steam has too many sales everyday, It would be abusive to check everything everyday. Although if I ever needed up to date pricing, I think the steamsales twitter feed would be better.

What I can do is import the information into a public spreadsheet, so anyone can obtain it if they need it. I can only think of 1 site that would need this data, that would be steamgifts. There game list isn't complete and doesn't list 1/2 of what you can gift on steam. I guess I could sell it, since 99% of people won't need it, but the %.0001 percent of them will need it badly enough to pay for it.

**TL;DR:** I made an app that parses the CDR, filters it, gets the price, checks the type of item and stores the information. It is the most complete list of games, dlc, and bundles you can buy on steam.

Most of them focus on small scale deathmatch or larger scale objective gameplay.  Yet we have no FPS games in which dueling is the main game mode. We have quake live and xonotic and other similar games that have dueling, but that's not what most of the playerbase plays. Most of the playerbase is playing TDM or CTF or CA or some other game mode.

Why is this? We have games that are mainly 1vs1 that have implemented a ladder system, such as starcraft 2. We also have FPS games in which dueling is a big part of the competitive scene, yet not really for the pub scene.

Is there anything significant preventing this from being a viable style of game or do people just not see any market for it? With a good ladder system, anti AFK systems, short(ish) matches, and decently enjoyable gameplay, I could see this happening. 

By successful I mean just something that has a playerbase and isn't abandoned  immediately after coming on the market.

It's not something I wrote on a blog and am posting here. It's a discussion I've been thinking about for a long time. I want input, I want opinions, etc.

Older gamers tend to look down on newer ones when they don't enjoy the games they themselves grew up with. Why?

I'm going to go out on a limb and say it. Some old games are inferior. Like physically just inferior. The UI and controls are counter-intuitive, the story is more basic, the characters not engaging, etc. That's just a thing. Comparing Warcraft 1 to Warcraft 3 is mind-blowing in the UI and control department.

Yet when a gamer doesn't play those older games or doesn't enjoy them, they're suddenly inferior. ""What? You don't like the original Legend of Zelda? Who are you, Hitler??""

But why do we do this? Why do we feel the need to ostracize those that don't want to go back and wrestle with a game to make it work? Why are they suddenly terrible people for enjoying the experience of booting up a game and having it just WORK, instead of messing with the sound files in the original Max Payne because they don't load right on Windows 7? Why are parents who make their kids start on the NES so superior to those that buy their kids an Xbox?

This has been confusing me for some time, and I would like some input. I'll even put myself out there for the burning: I find the original Half-Life subpar compared to the second. The first lacks the controls, the depth, and the experience that the second one provides. Yet I have gotten into arguments with people on this subreddit who say that the first is better because. Because why? Because when you were 9 and the game came out it was so good and you relive that magic every time you play it now? That's not a reason.

Unless there is some intrinsic reason gamers need to go back and play old games, I'll take my Diablo 3 over Diablo 2 or even the first Fallouts any day. I'll take my Starcraft 2 over Warcraft 3 or Age of Empires 2. UI changes happen for a reason.

Now, please. Discuss.


TL;DR unless there is something I'm missing, when nostalgia is factored out why are older games better, and why do we expect younger people to hold the same interest in them as we did?

Most of us grew around Quake, Unreal Tournament, Counter Strike and similar games where the only real way to get better tools of destruction is to pick them up on the map or earn them during that single game. Now we're faced with the RPG-esque unlock and ranking systems in Call of Duty, Battlefield and many more shooters where a weapon unlock is persistent on your character and can be used from one match to another.



The first time I came into contact with such a strong unlocking system was with CoD4: Modern Warfare. Though I found myself performing the best with a starter gun (MP5) and only requiring a single unlock to do even better with it (Red Dot Sight), there was still strong critique over the game not setting everyone off at the same level. There is no doubt to the fact that this sort of critique grew even stronger with the release of MW2 and the much more prevalent progression system it had. At that point I hoped that the future of FPS games wouldn't be one where the player putting the most hours into it has the greatest advantage.



Battlefield: Bad Company 2 also had a progression system. In that case however, I felt that the critical unlocks were the first ones for each class and any unlocks after those were just alternatives to what you already had. It was mostly true, ignoring a few exceptions (pre-nerf M60 LMG with ACOG scope). Right from the first unlocks you were ready to fill out your role on the battlefield and do what was needed to achieve victory.



**The reason I believe a strong progression system discourages players from working toward a common goal, and instead pursuing individual success** stems from my experience in BF3 so far. Comparing it to BC2 it is very clear that the individuals willing to sacrifice their personal stats and take higher risks to better the team's chance of winning are much harder to find. Why is this? Because they're playing their own personal game of unlocks.



As most of us know especially the vehicle unlocks in BF3 are built in a way that the more you unlock the better you are. Flares on jets are a great example. You're useless without them, but you can't unlock them without doing something useful. **A player is much more likely to hop into a jet and die trying to score points in it than focus on attacking the objective with the rest of the team.** This applies for snipers, tank drivers, everyone. I even recognise such behaviour in myself!



Having realized this I looked back at my brief time playing MW2 and noticed how dominant the individual centered playstyle was there. I personally never cared for how well our team does. Only my K/D and how much closer I was to the next unlock mattered.



Bad Company 2 wasn't like this and it makes me sad to see Battlefield 3 is shaping out to be more like Modern Warfare than it's predecessor(s). What are your thoughts on the issue?



PS: Don't take this as me saying any of the games mentioned are bad.

How motion can make the difference.,carpeggio,200,55,75,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/10orek/motion_compared_to_graphics_how_motion_can_make/,"[The images that sparked this.](http://imgur.com/a/vjrfk) It's screenshots of Battlefield 2 (2005) and Battlefield 3 (Late 2011.)

I find screenshots NEVER do video game GRAPHICS justice nowadays. They do art concept and style justice a majority of the time. How the scene moves and reacts and how we interact with it is what I call graphics. Pictures at MOST will show stylistic features and stand-still quality. I'd say everything working together visually is a ""graphics"" definition. These pictures represent everything stylistic about the comparison.

Showing these comparisons to a non-gamer they might see some differences. For the most part they will decide the skill of the capture is better in the BF3 because of the more accurate representation of shadow and detail. It might be a little disconcerting to see how they remark that they are pretty similar. Considering time has past and technology has improved between BF2 and BF3. One would expect that the difference would be larger. The missing link to reach this conclusion is motion.

As soon as jets do low fly-by's and explosions start going off, then you'll see the big difference between BF2 and BF3. Motion sets game apart in term's of graphics now-a-days. Simply statically representing a scene is a thing of the past. Look at the difference between Far Cry 1/2. FC1 could take very very nice screenshots, and so can FC2. The main difference being resolution of those screens and details, but also the physics engine of being able to blow up shacks and panels that gave motion resolution. Things now need to be set in motion beautifully.

I feel like I'm making a comment in the early 2000's. Screenshots no longer give any game justice. In order for a game to be taken seriously graphically, there needs to be 1080HD gameplay on all max settings easily linked to (youtube.) 

So how do you move art style and visual representation into the motion category of a game? More importantly, how do you keep the high resolution of style/graphics and motion while expanding the borders of what is possible in a game? Skyrim and Battlefield are excellent example of both done to today's standards. Battlefield's motion is explosive, raw, and gritty. As you would expect from a fast-paced war game. Skyrims motion is held in a faw wider scope. It's a full experience adventure game where you experience battle pace and leisure pace. So the motion of your environment has to be varied.

I think even with room for improvement in the graphical category of visual gaming, the real experience of magic/realism will be in the movement of a game. How can you lead a player to experience this ""high-resolution"" movement in a scene, so he comes out saying, ""It's a living breathing world."" Which refer to the subtle elements of motion (like a chest moving up and down while breathing) that ultimately make a huge statement on the status of the world, and give it credibility. 

Maybe motion is a sum of it's parts with a few extra tricks. Or maybe it's not. I feel though, that the feel of motion in a game is to be held in high regard in comparison to graphics. Sometimes I don't feel like it's commented on enough.

I just finished Deus Ex HR and it seemed to capture the contradiction at the core of modern gaming. The problem is, who is player. Why am I in control of the character some of the time and not at others. The immersion is broken unless during a cut-scene the character on screen acts in the best interest of the player, as the player would want him/her to act. 

In Deus Ex HR Jensen did some rather stupid things. Most notable of which was the first encounter with Zao in the penthouse. How could he be so stupid as to allow her to be so feely that he would be pushed out through the door. It reminded me that I wasn't Adam, he was still his own character. The immersion was broken. 

I remember in an interview, Hideo Kojima was asked why he got ride of Snake for the greater part of MGS2. He said it was because Snake was supposed to be blank canvas and the player could project himself onto the figure running on screen. It shouldn't make a difference if it was Snake or Raiden. I think he missed the point of what he had down with the character of Snake. Snake was a character that the player wanted to be. In every cut-scene, in every story development of the game Snake acted the best possible way. When Snake was fooled the player was fooled, when snake had to knock out Meryl, the player had to knock out Meryl. The story also kept the player and Snake in sync. That's why that game was so great. 

Some games over do the coolness of the character. In Devil May Cry during the fighting cut-scenes Dante could do things I never could as a player, I wasn't need. 

p.s. Another great game is Half life, their solution, Gordon never did something the  player didn't do. 


edit. I like cut-scenes, they just have to fit in with what the player wants for the character.

I've read no reviews, heard no opinions, and know nothing of the plot. I enjoyed FF13 (enough to put 70apx hours into it) so I assumed it a safe bet quality wise. It occurred to me that I and a number of other gamers tend to blindly purchase sequels without truly understanding or appreciating  the changes/alterations (or lack thereof) between titles. 

Cod is my main offense. I pick up a new copy every November on impulse, then spend the rest of the year complaining to my friends how nothing changes. I never seem to learn my lesson there. Assassins Creed is my second, where minute design changes are covered by a new narrative and skin. 
Now most franchises keep plots very simple and separate between titles so to attract new customers, and even go so far as to develop interactive experiences to supplement past works in order to get new players up to speed. (ie. Mass Effect/Dead Space)

In the end I feel cheated by the lack of continuity in sequels, where few references are made to past experiences and events, and design overhauls/shifts are fewer and farther between. Now more than ever,  it seems viable to just wait for the final iteration in a series and catch up via the internet rather than be milked yearly for lazy development.

Have you ever blindly purchased a title based on a previous iteration? If so what compelled that purchase: nostalgia, genre, developer?

1 - The Publisher system, and its infantility

Basically, there are effectively three main problems with publishers in that regard. Publishers are given power to meddle which would be seen as unacceptable even in an environment as meddlesome as Hollywood, except for the worst schlock. 

There are enormous pressures to reach completely unrealistic review targets which, if videogames were compared on an equal footing with other art, would be seen as obvious hyperbole (just compare the rotten tomatoes ratings for, say, the best movies of the past decade and the metacritic ratings for games which were seen as mediocre at best for a quick and dirty overview), including financial pressures.

There is also an incredible amount of immaturity from publishers: when a movie receives a bad review, the first reaction of the moviemakers is not to buy a full page ad to ""set the record straight"". Not even George Lucas did it and this is a man who surrounded himself with terrified yes men because he couldn't deal with criticism. 

Finally, there is a corporate culture which is completely foreign to the art world: no show, no ballet, no opera premiere worth its salt bans critics, when a movie doesn't have critical screening it's a good indication that even the makers know it sucks. On the opposite end you get NDAs, and employees reviewing themselves and sinking reviews of other groups (EA is getting infamous for this), and corporate secrecy to a ridiculous extent, and what should be a time for criticism is often treated as an excuse to treat reviewers to ridiculous corporate parties and other such nonsense. If a movie director decided to dine and wine a bunch of critics just before a premiere, and only critics, it would be seen as absurdly suspicious. 

2 - Reviewers, and their lack of culture

That one sounds incredibly bitchy but I consider it wholly deserved. Most videogame reviewers show an incredible lack of culture, or at least review games as though they had no culture whatsoever besides games. 

This leads to nonsense like Bioshock Infinite being compared to Citizen Kane, which only tells me that the reviewer is a) an idiot, b) has never actually seen Citizen Kane and c) just name dropped some famous movie he probably knows fuck all about besides ""Rosebud"". And I'm being generous.

There is also an expectation of reviewers to give high reviews, which is reinforced by a complete lack of independence. It's not just a matter of financial independence: car magazines are also dependent on ad revenue and actually, for the most part, give out relatively honest reviews compared to game publishing. There's also the matter of intellectual independence; it's not just a matter of having the guts to do critique, it's also a matter of rampant fanboyism, which dependence on advertisement revenue simply exacerbates. Most art reviewers have this independence because they work for newspapers and because art critique is a very old, very established part of art in the first place. An artist who doesn't take criticism well is an artist who doesn't grow. Despite the old saw, not all art critiques are completely unaware of what they're critiquing, in fact most probably have some semblance of art education.

I don't expect reviewers to be able to quote Adorno in untranslated german or to namedrop McLuhan and Zizek every third sentence, but if you're going to pretend that what you're reviewing is art, review it as art; a piece of art is not a car. 

And finally, it would be appropriate to give recognition to the creators first, not only to the companies which hire the creators; this applies both to the publishers and to the tendency of some to do brand recognition through studio names even when said studio treats the people who actually do the work as interchangeable cogs in the machine. Chris Avellone, Tim Cain, Josh Sawyer: these are creators. Obsidian Entertainment: this is a company. That attitude, which I forgot to mention in part 1, is also part of the problem in treating a videogame as art. If a game is to be treated as little else than a factory product behind the scenes with coders who do assembly line writing, then making art out of this requires sysyphean efforts.

3 - The Fandom, that goes without saying

Yes, how dare I.

Videogame fans, especially the vocal ones, are often incredibly immature, in addition to displaying the same issues as reviewers. They form a second type of pressure on reviewers in that a bad review of something they like will tend to ruffle feathers. Sometimes there are bad things, and people like bad things. It's called guilty pleasures, there's nothing wrong with it, but someone liking it doesn't make it ""The Portrait of Dorian Grey"". 

Accusations of ripping off are, sadly, all too common, and this ridiculous copyright culture we have these days obscures a major fact of human cultures: there is no new story, there is no original story, they've all been told, it's just how you tell it and what you do with the fucking archetypes.

It makes playing the game so much more satisfying when you begin to really understand whats going on at every level in the game, even beyond the main plot.

But they way these mechanics are implemented are usually wrong in my mind. Usually the locks are skill based, level 1 locks/computers are usually easy, and available right off the bat, while higher levels are harder, and only become accessible when you have the appropriate skill level. I feel that you shouldn't be punished by the game if you choose not to develop  skills that would allow you to attain the information. 

My proposition is to keep the difficulty level of locks and terminals but get rid of the necessary amount of skill to unlock the hardest ones. instead, let hard ones be really hard if you have low skill, but if you choose to add on more skill, the harder locks become easier and easier. This way gamers don't feel left out if they choose not to specialize in this task, but they still get the same experience, just with a greater challenge.

EDIT: A lot of people have pointed out that my Idea would make (lets just call it ""lockpick skill"") adding skill points to an ability pointless since with enough time and effort a player could get past any difficulty. I never thought about it that way and it makes a lot of sense. Also people of people also pointed out examples of my proposed system, which i haven't had to opportunity to play.

Far Cry 3, Tomb Raider, Uncharted, Bioshock, and Max Payne 3. These are all games that I love, but so much murder occurs in these 15-20 hours it starts to disconnect itself from that particular game experience. I'm not tired of violence in video games at all, I know violence has it's effective roles, just the amount of killing that the character I play as, is committing. I feel like it happens too often in games where the kill count at the end of the game ends up in the hundreds or even the thousands. Also I'm not arguing it's realism either, but it just seems to not fit the story told in certain games. 

Take Bioshock Infinite for example. Sure, Booker is a troubled ex-soldier who has no problem killing a couple of guys - but the amount of people that died by the hands of Booker Dewitt was borderline genocide. Bioshock Infinite had a great story and great characters, but the game-play that ensued under the alias of Booker seemed to not really fit his character outside of the gameplay, even for how desperate and smug he might of been. 

Why do you think this is, and how to you think something like this could be remedied in the future?

This game, released in 1999 is still one of the best turn based single player games in existence and it makes my top 3 list as one of the best and most balanced games ever created. 

The AI is programmed well, and doesn't cheat. Each AI opponent takes a real turn, and has the same limitations as a real player. 

The graphics, although a bit dated are still playable in 2013. 

Sound production is of an extremely high quality. And the game creates great ambience. 

The game world has some very cool features. Upgrading your heroes are worthwhile and strategic planning is essential. Town management is another plus, as well as the ability to upgrade creatures. 

Resource management is simplistic, but this means the game is intuitive. 

Things I would have changed:

1. Ability to upgrade castle defenses. Having no control over your castle archers means that the AI decides who to fire on. Would be nice to have the ability to upgrade the castle further. 

2. Get rid of tactics. It is so annoying having to reposition troops before each fight. Rather get rid of it. I actively kill off any hero who has advanced tactics. Simply because it is so annoying. 

3. Better spells, some of the spells are completely useless and not worth using. For example once you have chain lightning - you'll most likely cast that 9/10 times. Inability to cast more than 1 spell a turn means that some spells will definitely go uncasted. 

4. Mass recruit. I hate having to select the castle, then manually recruit creatures one at a time. Would be nice to have a button - recruit all and assign to hero. 

5. Merge towers. Would be nice to merge 2 heroes, where the more powerful hero incorporates the skills and abilities of the less powerful - caps might apply. 

6. Ability to destroy town buildings. Nothing worse than not being able to defend a town on day 6, while you know the enemy will capture that town and get a fresh dose of creatures. Ability to build or destroy one building at a time would be an advantage - not sure how this would affect balancing.

- Yes, it's hard, it's unforgiving and I love it. It's currently my most played game after SC2.
- Yes, I am a relative newbie to the game. I've only finished the game once and haven't gotten very far yet with an NG+ playthrough. In most singleplayer games that would qualify you as at least somewhat knowledgeable, but I realize DS is a bit of a different beast in that regard.
- I realize this game is/has been reddit's wet dream concerning skill-based game design in the recent past. I also realize I risk pissing off a large contingent of avid fans. However, I notice a serious lack of discussion about the game that doesn't justify any and all flaws as ""it's just hardcore like that. L2P.""

What I want to do in this thread is have that discussion: take an objective look at the game's pros and cons and try to be honest about what is unforgiving game design and what is sloppy and/or broken. In order to further the state of the gaming industry, it would be helpful to pinpoint exactly what can be learned from DS.

---

To start things off myself:

**Invasions**:

For a PvE player like myself, they're just stupid. You're merrily on your way, fighting some new kind of monster, barely hanging on and xXxR4ng3rKn1ght420xXx steps up and backstabs you, and you are now potentially out of X humanity and (in my most recent case) ~40.000 souls. Focus on the invader and the regular monsters will kill you. As any PvP player will tell you, the soul level limit does very little to keep fights balanced when players can make dedicated PvP characters and transfer high-level gear to them.

Of course, you can only get invaded when you are in human form. Same with summoning allies or NPCs. Risk vs reward type design, it makes sense, and this is usually how players justify this design. 
I would agree if it were not for this one thing: *You can't avoid being human quite regularly.* There is no way to kindle bonfires without that. 
When do you kindle bonfires? *When you've just arrived in an area and are having a hard time, almost by definition.*

The design choice to link activating/upgrading a save point and opening yourself up to PvP is a nonsensical one, IMO. It makes you vulnerable to other players with the sole intention of killing you at exactly the time when you are weakest. Gameplay-wise, the two have nothing to do with eachother. The only way to avoid it is go through the game with only 5 Estus flasks. For a game that prides itself on being skillbased, brutal and honest, being randomly assassinated by overleveled players is a bad fit.

**Weapon hits/collisions**:

Why is it that my uchi gets stuck on a wall when I slash more or less parallel to it, yet that Titanite Demon over there swings a huge axe through two solid walls and hits me? Don't get me wrong, it's not a huge issue or anything, but there are instances in the game where a fight is uncharacteristically hard because you are hindered by your surroundings while your opponents are not. This is pretty much the sole reason I stopped using greatswords - it is simply too common to get into areas where you can't even swing them properly. Getting hit by a dagger through a massive column is not good game design no matter how you spin it, and it seems more like an oversight or laziness on the developer's part than anything that can be justified as a conscious design choice.

There are other instances where the weapon hit detection is a bit dodgy. Getting hit by the slow-moving blunt rear-end of a spear, for example, and taking full stab damage. Or enemies adjusting their flight path or facing in mid-air to compensate for your movement.

If this were the first game in the series I would be understanding of these errors. However, it isn't. I never played Demon's Souls, but I'm assuming it was the same in that game? If this is a conscious decision, what could possibly justify it? I am at a loss.

**Blighttown**

This area isn't actually all that difficult combat wise. It's just bloody annoying. The level design has you walking across all kinds of rickety structures, often with strange geometry sticking out or holes in the surfaces. I think the moving bridge takes the cake: standing still at certain spots while it's moving will slide you off the side due to weird bounding boxes. Now, when you put enemies in an area like this that are capable of bumping you into a chasm even if you block their attack, you're just messing with players. You're more or less forcing a bunch of random deaths caused by unpredictable/unavoidable knockbacks (depending on player build and loadout. For a shield+sword player, or heavy armor player this is hell. Dodge-based characters will have a hard time as well, but at least it's in their own hands whether they dodge off a bridge or not.)

Then there's the fact that you *will* get poisoned going through the swamp no matter how high your poison resistance is and there is no merchant in the area. In order to get through Quelaag, I had to get back out of the Swamp, back up to Undead Burg, buy a ton of moss clumps and get back in. Complete time sink for very little (if any) gain in gameplay quality.
Also, toxic blowdarts with laser guidance.

So, what are your thoughts? Feel free to attack any of my points above as long as your main argument is not ""learn to play"". If I was just bothered by the game being difficult I would not be going through a second playthrough now.

**TL;DR: If you had to explain some of Dark Soul's oddities and were forbidden to use ""it's unforgiving"" as an argument, what would you say? What are some of the weakest points of the game, overlooked or not?**

*Edit, Two more additions. Thanks for the discussion so far!*

**The design of the primordial serpents**
I realize this one is a bit more of a subjective thing, but what the hell. Serpents with human teeth? A skull that more or less protrudes out the side of their body? I'm not sure if the intention was to make these look goofy as fuck, but that's what they managed. For a game with otherwise amazing art direction, I'm not sure which intern got tasked with designing these.

**Unreliable triggers**
In a game where experimentation and trial-and-error is encouraged so much, I feel special attention should be given to the scripting of game events and sequences. Currently, there are quite a few opportunities for players to irreversibly screw themselves by missing, glitching or otherwise triggering an event ""wrong"". 
Examples: 

- Fall down Frampt's pit before talking to him and place the Lordvessel? Both Frampt and Kaathe will now assume you picked the other one, and neither will be accessible for the rest of the game (even though the player is probably not even aware of Kaathe at this point in the game).
- Siegmeyer can get glitched and not show up in Anor Londo, even if you saved him in Sen's. You are required to go back to Sen's, redirect the boulder machine, then talk to Siegmeyer again and he will possibly be fixed. I've heard mixed reports about whether this actually works. Already beat O&amp;S? Byebye Siegmeyer storyline.
- Being able to kill Gwynevere in Anor Londo without triggering the results, simply by using a ranged weapon outside of her room. (Not sure if this one still works, but it used to.)

**Controls oddities**
You almost never use a ranged weapon when you are in lock-on range. So, you're mostly going to be using the zoomed-in mode. Why, then, do you need to explicitly exit this zoom mode before you can swap your weapon to a different one? Dodge doesn't work, running doesn't work, estus doesn't work, nothing works. Only LB1 and RB1. See an enemy coming up to attack and want to get your shield out and block? LB1, d-pad away from bow, LB1. A bit weird.

Same thing for the in-game menu. It's not particularly handy to block off your estus, run and roll buttons as long as you have the UI open. I like how it doesn't pause the game, but then you should also execute the concept fully and be able to completely control your character with the menu open.

(Maybe)](http://twinfinite.net/blog/2012/10/01/big-sloppy-slomper-chompers/)

Ever since The Binding of Isaac was released and became a big hit last year, fans have speculated a lot about the true meaning behind the game's many endings. Game creator Edmund McMillen always said he had a definitive answer to it, but chose to keep it to himself, as he preferred to let fans speculate and give the game their own meaning. But after the release of The Basement Collection (A re-release of McMillen's previous work), one fan has been able to piece together not only the true meaning behind The Binding of Isaac, but also identify the over-arcing theme of several games from McMillen's long game-dev career. McMillen confirmed the accuracy of this article[ on his blog](http://edmundm.com/post/32717083908/the-chest-is-open).

But many people are still unfamiliar with Edmund McMillen's games, so why should you care? The reason I'm sharing this with you guys is to give an example of how deep and symbolic storytelling in games can be when done right. TBOI got a lot of attention early on for how it dealt with it's mature and symbolic themes, which was a great achievement by itself, but I had no idea how deep the meaning was until reading this article. So I thought it was worth sharing here as well.

------

**To those of you unfamiliar with The Binding of Isaac:**

TBOI is a rogue-like created by Edmund McMillen (known from Super Meat Boy and Indie Game: The Movie). You play as the character Isaac, a young boy trying to escape from his mother after she got a call from God, telling her to sacrifice her son to prove her faith to God. The game is inspired by the dungeons in Zelda, similar to how Super Meat Boy was inspired by the platforming in Mario. Each time you play through the game, the items you unlock, the levels you explore, what bosses you encounter and so on is all randomized, in an attempt to create an infinitely replayable game. Similarly to the dungeons in Zelda, at each level (or floor) you will find a lot of rooms with monsters, hidden chest and a key item, and you advance to the next level by defeating the level's boss. At the end of each playthrough, if you advance far enough, you'll unlock one of the many endings (13 in total).

Therefore, I'd like to see a discussion here :)

*TL;DR - I'd just like to say that everything below is my line of though, and description of arguments used in the discussion which I had with my friends. You don't have to read all of it if you understand what I'm asking in the title. :)* 


First of all, I have to say this will probably depend on the game. It also depends on the definition of ""pay to win"" and whether if includes only direct stat/attribute increases, game difficulty or convenience.

1. As my first example I can mention Guild Wars 2. For you that haven't heard, GW2 will allow players to trade gems ( which you buy for RL cash) for ingame gold, on the official trading post. With gems you can buy only customization items like costumes, weapon skin swapper, summonable banker, xp boosts, etc. Nothing really game changing, mostly decoration and convenience items (levels dont matter for pvp, they are barely noticeable in pve).

2. The next game is the one that started this discussion - Eve Online. Again, a quick explanation - In Eve online you can buy with RL cash  Pilot Licence Extensions (PLEXes) which can be traded for ingame currency - ISK. These PLEXes can be activated by it's owner at any time to extend the player's subscription by one month, they can be sold again or destroyed (accidentally or on purpose).

3. The arguments that my friends presented (we are all, or were at one point, Eve Online players) is that by having money, you get power. In GW2 that means you can buy better items, better armor, crafting ingredients. In Eve Online you can buy huge ships and modules for them, increasing corporation or alliance assets. By buying and selling enough PLEXes, you could theoretically 'equip' your whole alliance with the strongest fleet possible and conquer the whole universe. They used a story (which might be a rumor or a lie, since nobody between has had a first hand experience with that) in which one russian CEO (leader) sold tens of thousands of dollars worth PLEXes on the ingame market, and got enough capital ships for everyone who was willing to join him. His alliance apparently managed to claim sovereignty in pvp space and get a foothold only thanks to vast amounts of money he spend to finance that. Now, this might not be true (I don't even have any names), but the fact is - this is technically possible.


4. My arguments were that all of these things are possible by not using RL cash. Although it is practically impossible, an individual can get a lot of cash by normal playing (normal in eve being mining/pve combat/griefing/scamming) and do the same thing. Also, even with all that money, there still had to be players willing to give ISK to buy these PLEXes (there's always plenty of that, eve market is huge), and enough ISK in the whole game to begin with. They also don't get any ships that wouldn't be accessible to other players, they just have a much bigger number of them.

5. In GW2 a similar argument can be made. Cash shop doesn't influence pvp at all - in pvp you automatically get max stat equipment and max level. In pve there are no gem-exclusive items at all, and even if there were - you can buy gems with ingame currency (gold) and afford it.


So basically, we came to a dead end. Me convinced that getting something with RL cash that is otherwise available in the game by normal means is not ""pay to win"", and them saying that being able get such an advantage by using RL cash is game breaking and therefore, it is ""paying to win"". If you guys didn't play any of these games, I imagine there are many more examples which you can use, I chose these 2 since I feel most familiar with them.

What struck me the most when playing it, was how much it was ""dumbed down"". The skills are now set automatically, you don't have skill trees anymore. I'm still unsure how I feel about this.

On the one hand, they produce games for the long run. That means that at some point everyone will run around with perfect skill sets anyway. So if they manage to balance the skills, they might actually make the game more interesting by making the skills interchangeable.

At the same time, though, characters are barely customizable and the whole game in the way it is laid out feels way more linear than the first two installations did...

When it comes to equipment I have two concerns. Number one: Damage per Second. Many people like it, but it just doesn't make it interesting to choose your weapon. In fact you barely choose anymore. You calculate. 14.3 is bigger than 12.2 so I'll take the former.

Also, they've removed identifying scrolls. The ""unwrapping a gift"" feeling that was strongest in D1 (cursed stuff), great in D2 and even copied well by Borderlands with those awesome chests...that's gone now. Curtesy to MMOs is the feeling I have.

Where the game shines is in it's aesthetics. Everything looks beautiful without being too cluttered. It really feels like a 3D version of D2.

The sense of adventure and setting out, the epic music that plays when you finally get to the Elite 4... And of course, long story short, every game since they've made refreshing changes to the battle system (of note to competitive players: Special being split into two stats, held items, the EV cap, the physical/special move split, all in succeeding generations), and then some.

Of course, because of the ridiculous ease with which it draws you in, and the nostalgia, it becomes pretty hard to criticize it objectively, making it nearly beyond reproach.

So of course, the questions: there are obvious parallels between the storylines of each generation's games, with minor changes (like the Rival becoming nice to you, off the top of my head), except with different landscapes and different Pokemon (I hadn't played in-game Pokemon in about 7 years before touching White/Black. I still had chills because of the music and all that).

This raises numerous questions, of course; and I ask that we discuss this not from a marketing point of view (because obviously, copy pasting a tried and tested formula with refreshing changes is bound to work). Is relying on this formula, and just changing up the variables (i.e., Pokemon, stat calculations) a crutch? I mean, if you think about it, if you've played one game, you've just about played them all. 

I can sense that this will probably get met with ""even if it were a crutch, the game is still highly enjoyable, so what's not to like""? Which brings us closer to the fundamental question really - is the enjoyment it brings out of some sense of nostalgia, that desire to recreate the feeling of the player's first Pokemon game/adventure, that one is able to completely ignore the game's faults? 

edit: **to address the new players liking it argument**

I probably used the term nostalgia too loosely (although of course, that applies to all who've played the game before); perhaps it's more accurately described by what I said here:

So I've played Halo since it's inception and am a pretty loyal fan. I also love to play other games. Fallout, Fable, GTA, Katamari, Gears, Trials HD, Grid, and on and on... The thing is, I consider Halo my 'go to' game for what I say when people ask me what games I play. It's not to say Halo is my favorite, but given the amount of time I've put into the franchise, it seems fair to list it first.

The problem I have is, I rarely actually let people know that I play Halo when asked. There have been many times where I'll be talking to a gamer (typically ones that would consider themselves 'hard core') and the mere mention of Halo totally turns the conversation off. There is clearly some stigma with Halo players that I'm missing here, and I need to know what it is. Has anyone else experienced the 'oh... you play Halo...' look?

I get that Halo players can be idiots, assholes and all around douchebags, but that's why we are given the almighty mute button. The gameplay itself is truly a polished product and provides for some amazing battles when playing with the right people.

So, why do people give me a funny look when I say I play Halo. On another, slightly related, but not important (and probably detrimental to constructive discussion) note, where does Halo fall if we were to rate the FPS genre by level of difficulty.

What's /r/truegaming's take on it?",JohnnyDan22,191,55,104,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/13lyx7/i_feel_like_inapp_purchases_heavily_degrade_the/,"*Please read edit

With the recent trend of In-app purchases, I feel there there is a significant shift in the thought process that goes behind making these games. Developers are making games where:

-The natural form of progression is very limited

-The odds are not in your favor

-Advancing through certain aspects of the game would take forever because the game mechanics have a handicap for those that do not make a monetary, real life additional purchase

Because of this, developers incorporate a way that players can either get a substantial boost/helping hand... and this is buy adding in-app purchases. The in-app purchases that give players a boost is usually a very significant boost, because they want to make the real life monetary value seem worth it by giving you a huge edge in the game. For me this feels very cheap. Many times these in-app purchases allow players to do simple things that would normally require some form of skill to accomplish. Example: ""To reset your stat points, you need to do x"" where x can be pay money, gain experience, complete a mission, etc.

Developers have now oversimplified this by saying ""pay x (REAL money), and get y"". For me, this is as if I'm entering a cheat code, because I'm going outside of the realm of the game now, and using real money to receive a (usually exaggerated) gain.
The result is you have a game where you would normally work hard to progress and get a sense of accomplishment, whereas now- the developers have scaled the requirements way up in what the game expects of you, since they incentivize making a purchase for it instead. It can really take away from an otherwise enjoyable game. Does anybody else feel the same?

TL;DR: For me, IAP's heavily degrade the value of what a great came could be, also makes it feel cheap when going outside the means of the game to gain progress with real money
 
  
 
EDIT: An important point I made which I want people to understand is- the fact alone that a game has IAP's will change the entire game dynamic than if it didn't have IAP's. Developers will make the goal of a certain game event more tedious (i.e. huge level of grinding), or near impossible, because there will be an IAP available which will get it done with real money. If that IAP didn't exist, the game dynamics incentive changes, and as a result, that game event would be completely different, and wouldn't be so boring/tedious. So when you think about it, **a developer has an incentive to make certain game events boring/tedious, etc. in order to offer a appealing IAP.** This is not my opinion, but rather simple economics. Few devs don't fall into this trap, but almost all do.

I also want to stress that my post is not targeted towards free games, because I've paid for games that had additional IAP's that would help me progress.

I am not against IAP's, and I'm not against the developers that use them. They have an incentive to make money. I just don't want them to cause a game to fall under the same problem. It's mainly an issue on mobile now, but with how much of a growing trend it's becoming, I have no doubt this will expand to consoles more heavily, especially with the steep competition.",,False,,t5_2sgq6,1353600217.0,,,True,t3_13lyx7,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/13lyx7/i_feel_like_inapp_purchases_heavily_degrade_the/,

So I thought it would be interesting to see what everyone's thoughts are on this subject.  When you play a modern game, there are commonly two levels of skill being dealt with: the virtual skills that your character has learned and the actual skills that you, the player, has learned (or proven that you have, if the skill in question isn't new to you).  Let's use some examples that emphasize each side, so this can be made a little clearer:

* In a Mario Brothers game, Mario never gets better at jumping than he is at the beginning (there's actually a page in the manual for SMB1 explaining that big and little Mario both jump the exact same height and distance).  Every landing he sticks is the player's achievement.  You are playing the game not to experience the world vicariously through Mario, but for the personal challenge it presents to *you*, the player.  Thus, every landing he misses is the player's fault first, Mario's fault second.  There is very little character skill in Mario games (and the ones that do exist are typically optional), but there is a *lot* of player skill.
* In a Final Fantasy game, players can never get better at finding random encounters than they are at the beginning.  They're random, that's just the way it is (with the exception of learning strategies based around which enemies cause said random encounters in which areas (and obviously, I'm ignoring in-game items that change the randomness of encounters, since that would just be a character skill anyway)).  But the characters *in* those encounters *do* get better, each and every time they engage in one.  This makes sense: it's an RPG, and the goal of an RPG is to role play *as* that character.  If it were up to your own personal skills, there's a danger of putting too much of your own personal identity onto these characters, rather than experiencing the story vicariously through their successes and failures.  When the character is killed in combat, it's the character's fault first, the player's fault second.  For this and other reasons, there is very little player skill in Final Fantasy games, but there is a *lot* of character skill.

With this in mind, which side do you find yourself usually leaning in favor of?  What balance of player skill and character skill would you consider ideal?",,False,,t5_2sgq6,False,,,True,t3_nutx4,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/nutx4/player_skill_vs_character_skill_which_would_you/,

A good starting point I've found was the PGR's dissecting of what they think are mistakes made with Nvidia Shield:

 http://portablegamingregion.com/features/why-nvidia-shield-handheld-gaming-console-could-easily-fail-and-what-can-be-done-about-it/

The article is quite lengthy, so here are the main points the author brings up:

- it's too expensive
- it has no exclusives
- portable streaming is a niche too weak to be used as a main selling point (EDIT: Since a lot of you misunderstood, it claims it's STILL a niche, not that it will always be.)

Also, another problem that was mentioned was:

- handheld gaming market is falling apart, Nvidia's timing is hence horrible

And on a semi-related note, the author claims that:

- Shield is NOT a proof of concept but a standard commercial product

I'm interested in hearing what you make out of all of this and if you have any additional insights about Shield. I'm really on the edge about pre-ordering it because although I think it looks awesome (unlike many) and the controller is fantastic - I'm not interested into streaming one bit and I also don't have an Nvidia GPU.

Although I was aware of most of its minuses, when I see them all in one place it does make me wonder whether Shield really will be an utter failure and will Nvidia abandon it soon after it launches just like Sony Ericsson did with Xperia Play.

In Call of Duty, the latter is very important (anticipating movement around the map) but the former is not; once a player is engaged, the outcome is mostly determined by who can line their sites up with the enemy and pull the trigger first. This is much less interesting than the dance that takes place between opponents in Gears and Halo when they square off against each other. To be honest, I think this is the crux of what makes Gear and Halo so interesting, that you are constantly at a battle of wits against the opponent and not just some competition of who has the fastest jerk-like reflexes a la COD.

To give a little bit of backstory, I am a relatively young gamer being born in 1994.

When I was little, my Dad was really keen on his games to the point where he felt he had to buy every big console that ever came out in order to have the best possible playing experience with the biggest library and accessibility to all the games.

I'd never noticed it, until he told me a year ago, that I seem to have had a different gaming experience to most people my age because of what my Dad chose to do.

He effectively conditioned me through many of the different consoles as I grew up so I knew what it was like to play older consoles and could appreciate the advances in technology that much more (I never knew this at the time, in fact, I thought my Dad was incredibly rich because there would be a new ""something"" every couple of months or so - what I didn't know was he already had them in the attic and was periodically bringing them down &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;)

Although it was kind of forced upon me, I think that what he did actually served me for the better, obviously by the time the xbox original came out I was more or less caught up with everyone else except I believe now that I could see the huge changes and advances that other kids did not. I'm not saying it makes me a special little snowflake or anything, but I'm grateful I had this opportunity.

I think it bears a large amount of resemblance to the age old discussion of the order you should watch Star Wars in, and in the context of gaming situation I was basically brought up with the originals first.

I don't think there was anything malicious about what my Dad did, he never MADE me play the games but they were always there as a suggestion which I ended up taking very seriously as I now am doing a college course in Creative Media Development which is practically game design.

They are the standards to which future generations of games are held. Fans will gush lovingly about them for ages on end. Sometimes we end up missing these gems. We go on with our lives, but then five-ten years down the road, the opportunity comes for us to pick them up (probably through a sale on Steam or GOG, nowadays) and we think to ourselves, ""Oh, right! That game! I've heard so much good about it! Well, I may as well pick it up.""

Sometimes, we come to the conclusion that the praise these games receive is just nostalgia talking. Other times, though, we come to the conclusion that these games deserve all the praise they receive and more.

My question is, what are your experiences with this? What older games have you picked up and found them to be over-hyped nostalgia trips, and what older games have been great gaming experiences?

I know for me, there are three games that stand out: Planescape: Torment, Fallout 1, and Thief. I had never played any of these games until the past year or so. I'd heard plenty of good things about them but had never picked them up. Man am I glad I did. All three of those games are absolutely incredible. Even by today's standards. I played Fallout 3 and NV before Fallout 1, and I still preferred Fallout 1. As for PS:T and Thief? Well, there's nothing even comparable to them today. These games stand alone, and being late jumping on the bandwagon hasn't dampened my enthusiasm for them at all.

As for old games that I was underwhelmed by, and made me think ""It must be a nostalgia thing?"" I hate to say it, but 99% of N64 games. I never had an N64 growing up, but we got one not too long ago, just for kicks, and really... The only game on it that I've gotten so far that's still worth playing today is, IMHO, Ocarina of Time. Stuff like Super Mario 64 is fun for a few levels but gets boring fast, Goldeneye has some great level design but the controls are way too iffy for me to enjoy it, and a lot of the other games are just... meh. Anytime someone talks about Waverace 64 being a brilliant game, I *know* it's just nostalgia talking.

There are a number of trigger topics that not only come up frequently, but seem to bring out the worst in people (e.g. EA, Ubisoft, DRM, day-one DLC, sexism, piracy, Call of Duty, etc.), and then there's the phenomenon that seemingly every announcement/game has people ready to jump on it and run it into the ground. It's not sufficient, it seems, to just *not like* something: it has to be verbally nuked/crucified over and over again.

SO! 2K Czech, I'm gonna do you a favor and just flat out tell you how to make the best damn tennis vidja to ever exist. You don't even really have to do much if you don't want to. Let's take Top Spin 4 and then just add a few things, shall we?

* 1. **Different racquets should give different attribute bonuses.** This is a no-brainer. Different racquets have different advantages/disadvantages IN REAL LIFE. For example, if I play with a 100 sq. inch, open string pattern racquet (like the Head Extreme Pro) I'm going to have a bigger serve and more powerful strokes from the baseline, but my accuracy and feel at the net will suffer. Conversely, a 90 sq inch racquet, like the Wilson Pro Staff 90, will give me better feel and accuracy but at the expense of power and spin. Every single racquet is different and one may be excellent for one player but crap for another. This is some true video game style shit and *it's real life.* Seriously, this is some very rich video game territory and there's no reason it shouldn't be incorporated into the biggest tennis video game franchise. Mario Tennis for the Game Boy Color did this quite well and it wasn't just some video game bullshit forced upon the player (like the shoes in NBA 2K series or the skates and sticks in EA's NHL series)...real racquets have different attributes for real players in real life. This is a situation where you can incorporate a popular video game trope while actually *adding to* the realism. What a rare and wonderful opportunity!
* 2. **Customizable racquets** This is building off the first suggestion, but there should be some slight customization options to make a racquet better suited to the created player. Not to get too much into the nitty gritty, but depolarizing a racquet's weight distribution (making it heavier but evenly distributed) makes it more consistent and better at returning pace, while depolarizing the weight (putting a lot of the weight at the very top and very bottom) makes it less consistent but gives it more extreme spin and power potential. This combined with the previous and next suggestion give some very good possibilities for a tennis video game. Again, this seems like a system perfectly suited to the video game crowd.
* 3. **Individual stat control** Okay, 2K, I get it. You made the whole ""Aggressive Baseline"" / ""Defensive Baseline"" / ""Serve &amp; Volley"" thing to balance out the online players who just maxed out power and smashed everything to win easily. But guess what? It didn't work. Players who want to dominate online just take ""Offensive Baseline"" every single level and still power hit everything. Please don't sacrifice the balance of the actual gameplay in an attempt to balance online gameplay. Online players will still find exploits.
* 4. **More player-created character slots** If I want to waste hours of my own personal time creating from scratch every player on the pro tour, that should be my prerogative, right? Why can't I create a bunch of players on my own and enter them into the tournaments that one comes up against in the Career mode? I should be able to crate my favorite players (or fictional ones) and meet them while I'm climbing the ladder to the Grand Slams.
* 5. **More player development** It would be really cool to start off at the junior or NCAA level and work your way up into the pro level. I understand that NCAA rights are probably expensive, but a fictional Junior tour probably wouldn't be too much of a problem.

If you didn't feel like doing much, you could really just port Top Spin 4 and add the first three suggestions. In all honesty, you could just make some DLC for Top Spin 4 and still have the best tennis game in history. If you wanted to go for extra credit, you can improve computer AI, graphics quality, include more outfits and balance gameplay by introducing more unforced errors and making serving more difficult, but it's really not necessary. Seriously, though, you could just tell your development team ""let's not worry about the gameplay, TS4 was adequate"" and just keep the match play exactly the same, while adding what I suggest (really, you're THAT close). You would still have the best tennis video game to ever be created. If you improved the presentation and AI, well that's just icing on the cake. But my other suggestions should really be a much higher priority.

First let me say that I am talking only about multiplayer, and particularly multiplayer with team mates, this doesn't apply to single player at all and I don't care how you play when you play alone.

So, first of all, I am someone that plays ""to win"" but to my mind, this is just ""playing.""  It seems to me implicit in the idea of a game that you would play it to win, or be successful, or whatever the victory condition is for the game.  

When I see someone screwing around in a team game game and ask what they are doing I often get a lot of ""I'm just having some fun man chill out"" or ""Dude, its a game, its supposed to be fun.""  But for me, it would be like going to a pick up basketball league and then just skipping around the court, tossing the ball around the gym randomly while claiming you are just having fun.  Its profoundly rude to the people who showed up there to actually play the game in question.  

What I am not saying is everyone needs to put in 100 hours of practice, I'm not even saying I care when people are *bad*, but I don't understand how the ""I'm playing for fun"" argument makes any sense in the context of a competitive game.  Whether its a public server or not, doesn't matter to me (see the pickup basketball analogy for a ""pub server"").

I guess this is coming off a lot more one sided than I originally meant it to be, so in this case feel free to argue against me, but to me, the long and short of it is that if you are playing a game, and the objective is to do X in the context of the game, and you just ignore X because you want to ""have fun"" then I don't understand why you are playing that game in the first place.

EDIT:  Another way of titling this could have been ""Playing for the game to complete the objectives/victory condition v. ignoring them because you think it is more fun to play a different way.""  I don't mean to argue that games are only fun if you win, but rather, that I don't understand why you would play a game with objective X in the first place if you weren't interested in objective X.

The problem as I see it, is that when I describe the core gameplay to my friends, they think it's boring.  

Essentially, the gameplay could be described as an online Final Fantasy Tactics game where your characters are completely controlled by AI.  You can fully customize your characters from their class down to what skill loadout they use.  For each character, you set their AI in a manner similar to Final Fantasy XII's gambit system.  For those of you not familiar, you have a list of priorities your character will follow, and in each slot you list a condition and an action to take when that condition is met.

For example, I might have a cleric with the top priority to heal the closest unit that has less than 50% health.  The next priority might be to cure status ailments on any nearby allies.  As a final priority, the cleric could attack/run away from the closest enemy.

Battles would take place watching your squad of 5 characters fight an enemy's squad using the predetermined AI you each setup before the fight with very minimal interaction by the players.  After a fight ends, you can spend points to level up new skills or make adjustments to your characters' AI as you see fit.

Personally, I really enjoy RPGs with AI controlled allies.  One of the challenges I did while playing FFT and Tactics Ogre was to start each battle with all of my teammates controlled by the AI and try to find the right gear and learn the best skills that the AI could use effectively.  I know a lot of people find this style of passive gameplay really boring, and I can completely understand that.

How do you guys feel about the AI controlling your characters in games?  Do your feelings change when you have more control over how the AI thinks?  Are there any other genres where this type of gameplay could be interesting?

Already, I've found myself sick of the idea of hotkey battle and the idea that ""Strength is how hard you hit, endurance is how many times you can be stabbed before death, agility is your ability to dodge attacks, and Willpower is your Mana-capability.""

So, I had made a *very* rough and *very* cheap 1/4in steel-plate sword without a sharp edge on it; it was smaller than ""the one hander"" in most fantasy games, but being made of plate steel at that thickness I feel gave it a realistic weight.

About me: For the purpose of the test, I'm roughly ""Warrior"" sized, at 6'1"", 265 pounds of mostly muscle with some extra light-armor around the midsection. 

I beat the dogshit out of an old, dead stump with this sword-standin in a number of ways to find out what swinging a sword means for the body, and how it could relate to an RPG/MMO stats system.

1. First, I swung it one handed with as much force as I could muster into the tree trunk; I got between 5-7 ""real good"" swings, and by the 15th swing I couldn't lift my arm. As I went through the swings, around the 8th or so my blows were mostly bouncing off the stump instead of doing any damage as the first eight did; I reached the conclusion that any MMO/RPG mechanic aiming for immersion and realism needs to decrease attacking strength, speed and recovery in some manner with Stamina.

2. Then, I swung the sword two handed into the stump as hard as I could for as long as I could. I got considerably more swings this time around, getting to around 11 or 12 before my swings stopped being ""good"", and around 25 before they stopped doing damage. From this, I learned that a weapon's size shouldn't determine outright if it is 1h or 2h, but if the character in question has the strength to wield the weapon in a 2h way; further, stamina (and by proxy, strength and speed) should decrease slower for a two-handed user.

Also during the 2h test, I learned that I was a whole lot less able to position and change stance while ""fighting"" the evil stump; one handed I could turn my entire body into or out of a swing to reposition behind or beside the ""target""; with a 2h form, I found this kind of maneuverability nearly impossible. 

3. I held another object of a similar weight and shape while beating the poor tree up. Let's just say there weren't any advantages. I was double-tired double-fast and the tree could be said to have won that round. I just don't think ""dual wielding"" a sword can work out. 

4. On Moving With Weapons: I found that, if a sword was tied to my body by the hilt in such a fashion as to rest on my back as if in a scabbard, I moved much more slowly and gassed myself faster than if I held it in my hand; I imagine it is because I can more accurately control the movement and weight of the sword while running.

5. General observations: I tried running and jogging after different ""sword technique"" tests, and found that I didn't really suffer in running speed or length until I was -really- beaten down tired; my arms were exhausted, but I could still run fine. 

While testing how I could perform while carrying varying amounts of weight (ranging from 25 pounds to 300 pounds), I found that my speed wasn't really dinged by the weight until ~150 pounds, but nearly any additional weight really starts to wear down on your endurance and stamina.

oh, that reminds me. I also decided through my tests that ""Endurance"" and ""Stamina"" really need to be two completely different stats; to me, Stamina was my ability to do a lot in a little time, and endurance was my ability to do a little over a lot of time.

Now that I've laid my little test out there, can we get some great minds to put this together and decide how a combat-and-stats system should work for a truly immerseive and realistic RPG/MMO?",,False,,t5_2sgq6,False,,,True,t3_t7rql,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/t7rql/on_hitting_a_tree_with_some_metal_to_determine/,

A recent Ken Levine interview was posted where he talks about ""1999 Mode"" and whoever the writer is wrote up this line:

&gt; ... just like you did in classic titles like System Shock or Deus Ex. Don't worry if you're not hardcore enough to have fond memories of that era, though.

Then it popped in my head... apart from very specific examples like Deus Ex, System Shock and... System Shock 2, there really isn't any game where every bullet counts, where every single thing you do drastically affects the outcome of the game.

Let's roll back shall we? The late '90s gave us Duke Nukem 3D, Quake, Half-Life, Medal of Honor, Tribes, Counter Strike, Unreal Tournament and like two other Quake games. This is only on the PC mind you because the console FPS scene at the time was negligible with obvious exemptions made for Goldeneye and Turok. Hell even Rainbow Six and Mechwarrior were tactical games but gave us enough ammo to finish a mission.

So what's this so-called ""Mode 1999"" a flashback to? Deus Ex wasn't even released until 2000 (2001?). So it should just be called ""System Shock"" mode, because really that's the only game it's calling back on.

But by calling it ""1999 Mode"" it's preyed on the fake-hardcore, the self-proclaimed hardcore and their combined egos by making them look at the past with even pinker glasses than usual making them think that the old days were filled with these intellectually stimulating shooters. Plus the last part is what really gets me:

&gt; Don't worry if you're not hardcore enough to have fond memories of that era, though.

Does age really matter? Since when does age dictate just how hardcore you are? My little brother (13 now) has logged on 799 hours (yes, really) on Garry's Mod, is he not hardcore enough? He's also played some Pokemon dungeon crawler game to the point where every single one in his Pokemon arsenal (there's a whole lot of 'em) were maxed out. He also gets together with his little friends and they EV train (?) their little pocket monsters. He also balances out his gaming hobby with reading tons of books, cadets, outside and playing MTG/W40K, is the ability to do this not hardcore? He's 13, but by Fett he's probably more hardcore than half the writers on that awful rag. I hate this notion that age suddenly decides just how hardcore you're allowed to be, some sort of e-peen bullshit for people that don't have enough going on in their lives so they need to give themselves an arbitrary rank.

That's not what I mean by follow up.)

Since Mario went 3D, every Nintendo console has had its own 3D Super Mario platformer. The Nintendo 64 had *Super Mario 64*. The GameCube had *Super Mario Sunshine*. The Wii had *Super Mario Galaxy*. Now, it looks like the Wii U is getting *Super Mario 3D Land*.

It seems like 3D World is taking a different approach from the other 3D titles. First of all, it's a sequel. The other 3D Mario titles have all been completely new and innovative entries. This game looks like a much safer concept than the previous ones. The gameplay is also very different from the regular 3D titles. Their main goals have been to collect a certain number of stars, but this is a much more traditional Mario experience. It has worlds, lives, and time limits, and the main goal seems to be to get to the end of the level like in traditional 2D Mario games.

In my opinion, 3D World looks like it's going to be a good game, but it's definitely not what I was expecting the next 3D console Super Mario game to be like. I was hoping for something closer to *Super Mario 64* with a hub world leading to a variety of different environments. Since the Wii U is much more HD capable than the Wii, I thought it would be a great opportunity to show off what it can do with some large areas for Mario to explore. I definitely don't want a sequel to 64, Sunshine, or Galaxy though. I'd rather they try a new concept instead of recreating what they already made.

What are your opinions on 3D World? How do you think it's going to stack up next to the other 3D Mario titles? Since this is a sequel, there is much less work involved in creating the game.

The OP, /u/YourMumsPal, was opening a discussion on how little Skyrim actually lets you decide.  It's an immensely open game, sure.  But, in his words:

&gt;It seems to me that a large aspect of the role-playing genre in the current generation of video games is based upon decision making and there are very, very few occasions where this occurs in Skyrim. Everything seems incredibly linear with your choices simply limited to either joing [sic] a guild/doing a quest or NOT joining a guild/doing a quest and this is only for the self-disciplined.

This struck me, for two reasons.

Side note: spoilers below.  Be warned.

One, he's right.  Skyrim is very limiting in how it lets the player decide how they want to approach certain situations.

Secondly, and the crux of the matter, Skyrim is perhaps one of the most open games of the past few years.  You can do pretty much whatever you want, when you want.  But it's very direct in telling you what you *can* do.  Many, if not all, decisions are made for the player.  In the Companions questline, you have no choice against becoming a werewolfspoiler.  In order to complete the questline, you *have to*.  But coming into the questline, you have no intentions of this.  You simply intend to kill shit.  The developers are forcing a moral code on your character.  And the few times that you do have to make a choice (i.e. destroying the Dark Brotherhood instead of joining it), it doesn't have any lasting repurcussions.  If you do decide to ""destroy"" the Dark Brotherhood, for example, you still get hunted by assassins.  *That* strikes me as something that is limiting freedom, which is what Skyrim is known for.

Anyways, this got me thinking: what's the difference here?  And I decided that there are multiple types of freedom--three types, which I will call Exploratory Freedom, Tactical Freedom, and Narrative Freedom.

Exploratory Freedom is what Skyrim is known for--the ability to do whatever you want, whenever you want.  Open World games are by their very nature free, in this sense.  Games that are Exploratively free let you set your own goals: do you want to keep delving deeper into this dungeon, or do you want to head back out and go hunt some deer?  Do you want to capture an outpost, or do you want to go fly a jet into some random citizen's face?  Exploratory Freedom is all about giving the player a set of tools, and letting them do whatever they want with them.

Tactical Freedom is about *how* the player goes about doing those goals.  Take for example a game that is close to many hearts, Deus Ex.  Deus Ex, like many stealth games, is not very exploratively free.  It gives you a goal.  It makes you complete that goal.  However, it lets you go about that goal in a variety of different ways.  Do you want to go in, guns-a-blazin'?  Or do you want to take the guards out one-by-one, with a tranquilizer rifle in order to not be spotted.  Or hell, do you want to play pacifist and duck through the vents to get to your goal?  Here, again, the developers give you a set of tools, but they don't let you run wild with them.  Instead, they painstakingly plan out a variety of ways to go about solving the bigger puzzle that is the goal, and makes you choose one, basing your decisions on what tools they gave you for the job.  Whereas Exploratory Freedom asks you ""What do you want to do?"" Tactical Freedom asks you ""How do you want to do it?""

Narrative Freedom is the thing that /r/YourMumsPal wants more of in Skyrim.  Narrative Freedom is where the developer creates a branching story and makes the player decide which branch they want to follow.  It's important to note that this is different from the other two--the other two freedoms are about gameplay.  Though Narrative Freedom can influence gameplay, the two are not in direct relation.  Mass Effect is a good example of this, as decisions that you make end up influencing events later in the game, which in turn provide decisions that influence their own events.  Narrative Freedom lets you impose a moral code on your character--what is he *willing* to do.  What are his desires?  Why does he do things?  Narrative Freedom is a beautiful thing when done correctly, and its perhaps the most actively engaging of the freedoms.  *This* is where Skyrim is lacking.  *This* is the thing that many developers fail to do.

In summary, there are three different types of freedoms: Exploratory Freedom, Tactical Freedom, and Narrative Freedom.  Each adds a piece to a puzzle of player choice.  Exploratory Freedom asks you what you want to do.  Tactical Freedom asks you how you want to do it.  Narrative Freedom asks you *why* you want to do it.",,False,,t5_2sgq6,False,,,True,t3_1fktm2,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1fktm2/a_different_kind_of_freedom_an_examination_of/,

No I am relating to two strong points where gaming has failed and it isn't even the fault of the developers!

These would be:
Game awards shows and 
game reviews

The industry has failed so hard at doing these two thing properly it is hard to find out where to start. I guess I'll try with reviews first as I am sure many of you can relate to the issues with them.

Currently the active scale for video game reviews is something like
1-6: This game is absolute trash
7: This game was alright but not worth buying
8: This game is pretty good
9: This was a good game you should probably buy it
10: This was the most perfect game ever in all existence

I shouldn't have to explain why this is a terrible scale to put games or any other medium on. It makes it hard for people to truly judge a game to almost any amount. The part about this that sucks the most is that this grading scale is applied unanimously on just about every large gaming review site or magazine. Perhaps this is because we as gamers have a tough time actually grading games without feeling too impartial or perhaps we just have not found the right people who can truly look at a game and compare all it's features according to a real 10 point scale.

What is worse is that now that this system has become so established anyone who tries to break from it is torn down by rabid fans preventing the system from changing. 

As for game awards shows, this would be a minor issue if they weren't hyped as much as they are. The best example of which is the recent and past VGAs. Games are being hyped and celebrities come in and it appears to have all the glitz and glamor of a hollywood award show, but looks is all it has. When it comes to actually giving awards it is nothing more then a popularity contest. The biggest releases that year are the only ones up for a vote while truly new, innovative and fun games get pushed to the wayside.

While this might make every COD fan wet themselves when they hear their favorite (and sometimes only) shooter is given an award it really doesn't help the industry because it does nothing but glorify what everyone already knows. If there isn't time to gather all the releases and judge them fairly for what awards are actually being offered it hinders creativity.

Then there is how this all looks to outside parties, people who are not and do not understand games. These kinds of award shows are a perfect chance to show that games are a respected medium, that they are their own art form, give credit and credence to those who call gaming a hobby as well as those who work so hard to deliver these gaming experiences to the masses.

The beauty reflected in the art of the games as well as the sales of the medium are proof enough to anyone who knows video games that they are a viable and respectable medium. But the way they present themselves in this manner takes so much away from that. The question here becomes, what can we do to reverse or fix this trend?

At the end of the game, the user is presented a choice between two alternatives: restore the world to its pre-Calamity state (presumably by rewinding time) or evacuate the Bastion and make a life in the world as it is. These are the kinds of decisions that I'd like to see more of in games; neither is clearly ""good"" or ""evil,"" and as such the player's choice tends to more revealingly reflect his or her own values. 

Restoring the world clearly has its appeal; restoring the lives of the (implied) hundreds killed in the calamity itself, as well as the hundreds more killed at the player's own hand in pursuit of the shards seems like a decent enough goal. On the other hand, given determinism, the Calamity is bound to happen again. Isn't the notion that the world will then be stuck in an eternal loop a little disconcerting?

Evacuating the Bastion, on the other hand, means a new life for Rucks, Zia and the kid, but isn't it a tad selfish to consider the welfare of three individuals above that of the entirety of Caelondia?

Ultimately, I chose evacuation, as I couldn't abide the notion of trapping the world in an eternal loop. Growth and change and the inconveniences that come with it are a necessary part of life, and a part that I desire to maintain, and that's something that I only learned about myself by playing Bastion.

Sidenote: Did anyone else think that Rucks was going to turn out to be the kid as an adult? The similar complexion, the gray hair, and the time that he says, ""This is for you, Mother,"" after completing one of the memorials? It seemed that maybe the kid would somehow be an exception to the time-rewind, returning to guide himself through the events necessary to deploy the restoration. It would also explain how he was able to narrate the kid's actions in such detail. Anyway, maybe that's just me.

***THIS THREAD DEFINITELY CONTAINS SPOILERS TO THE PLOT OF BORDERLANDS AND BORDERLANDS 2 -- IF YOU HAVEN'T COMPLETED THE GAME YET, STAY AWAY!***

Quick disclaimer:  I haven't actually completed Borderlands 2.  I've watched my friend play most of it and am working my way through the first one before I pick up the second one.  With that in mind, I'm going off of a rough understanding of the specifics of the plot, but I think I know enough to make this an intelligent post.  Like I said before, major plot spoilers will be in this thread -- and very early on, at that, so beware.  Anyways, here goes!

When people started finishing Borderlands 2 after its release, there was a lot of talk about some inconsistent story elements.  Roland's, Angel's, and Handsome Jack's deaths don't really align with the player's understanding of the universe, namely the fact that the New-U stations have been reviving the player (including Roland, in the first game) every time they die.  The New-U stations are also owned by Hyperion, which Handsome Jack -- however illegitimately -- owns.  This raises the questions of why Roland, Angel (Handsome Jack's daughter, if you haven't played), and Handsome Jack don't respawn when they're killed.  There have been plenty of fan theories with varying degrees of probability to them, which may or may not solve the issues.  It really just depends on how you wanna rationalize it.

The other issue is that the player is allowed to respawn at all, at least in the second game.  As previously stated, Handsome Jack owns Hyperion, which owns the New-U stations.  Why would Handsome Jack allow his enemy, which he spends the entire game desperately trying to kill, to have an infinite number of lives?  This, too, has some fan rationalizations that may or may not solve the issue.  Again, it depends on how far you're willing to stretch on how the story is presented to us.

By themselves, these two problems seem ridiculous and like sloppy, lazy writing, which they may very well be (not to say that the Borderlands games aren't awesome, because they are).  However, what if we compare it to the game as a whole?  Borderlands 2 put a lot of emphasis on dark humor and parody.  The whole game is over the top, really, from the snippets of dialogue that the characters spew on occasion, the actual dialogue that takes place between characters, the random gun generator that generates ridiculously random guns with random gun names, and the nature and names of the enemies.  It's all bizarre and wacky when you look at each element of the game individually, but, in the context of the game, it fits; and I think that it's because this is a pretty well-done satire of the first-person shooter genre.  It takes a lot of the elements of mainstream FPSs and turns them into caricatures.

I'm a huge proponent of gaming as an art form, and I'd really like to believe that Gearbox is effectively satirizing the medium.  Unfortunately, a lot of people don't recognize it, which is to be expected of satire -- satire's often a hard thing to distinguish because it doesn't usually let on that it's a joke.  Borderlands is a bit more obvious about it, but gamers aren't yet used to analyzing games in this way.  Not to mention that many gamers may not even have much experience with satire, which is a pretty high-level literary technique that can really only be analyzed through experience with the technique.

So, maybe this is a big step for video games as art, or maybe I'm just reading way too far into this game.  I sincerely hope that it's the former, but I'd love to hear this subreddits thoughts on Borderlands as a satire and video games as art in general.

Case in point: GTA. When you drive somewhere the GPS Map is all you really look at despite the pedestrians and traffic and immaculate detail.

I get that we need to see the forest, but we also need to see the trees? It's a very confusing middle ground. The mini-map helps, but it also detracts.

Same old promises of the Wii U are all confirmed thus far. Black Wii U was expected as a design standpoint.

Pikmin 3, finally, I always loved Pikmin. The game seems exactly like normal Pikmin, but using the Wii U would make extra puzzles available. This is gonna sell the Wii U for me.

Maybe it's just the cynical me, but I hate how they keep saying ""it will change everything"" in every single presentation, not only nintendo, every company.

Two gamepads, soon they will catch the revolution of four at once! It's at least expected, only one was just weak. The gamepad doesn't seem that impressive anymore, maybe the hype have died in the time of a year. That doesn't seem like a good sign.

Mii Wara Wara. That has the opportunity for being such a hassle, we need a lot of options to keep gamers in check. Conneting to PC? Starting to like this nintendo.

Super Mario Bros. U, seems like a Mario game. The feature of placing blocks seems similar to rayman legends. For me, it doesn't interest a little bit.

Batman Arkham City, acting at its best Reggie. Finally a way to easily select items, will probably be the best console version. The others gadgets doesn't seem that interesting for me, probably a skip if they upgrade other versions too.

Scribblenauts, I never got too much into the DS game, but multiplayer seems to open a lotof possibilities. Will have to wait to pick this up.

Darksiders II, Mass Effec 3, Tekken Tag Tournament 2 and Trine 2 all interest me, but why would I buy some of them again in Wii U, I don't know. The others, meh.

Wii Fit U, seems worse than the Kinect fit. After watching the Microsoft press conference I can't feel anything but restricted in those control methods. Well, I will not buy both anyway.

Sing, this seems to be so much fail, I can't even imagine having fun with this. Having a karaoke in my house, barely using it, why do I need another?

Super Mario Bros. 2 for 3DS, I can't even begin to care about it anymore. It feels like the same game I played 50 times before. More about gold? That is not like a change.

Paper Mario, seems like the same game with a new kinda cool element. I like this game anyway, I can kinda cut you a slack there.

Luigi's Manssion 2, I loved the first one because it felt unique and this one looks a good sequel compared to the first one.

Castlevania probably the one I care most about in this.

Lego City Undercover, looks excelent for a lego game, all the others have been about linear gameplay and repetition, this one has this open worldness about it. Yes seems like GTA, but it's not another gameplay repetition. Voices turn me off...

Just Dance 4, finally a godamm showing of the game instead of Flo rida. Changing the dance moves seem to be an awesome thing to screw up with your friends, SOMETHING NEW IN MY DANCE GAMES.

ZombiU, again, clever usage of controller. I can expect that you can't pause to use an inventory or anything like that, if you can, this game is going to lose all of its charm. Has future.

Nothing to comment on the other games that hasn't been said already.

NintendoLand, minigame bundle. The showing took just too long. The start of the presentation was all ""There is no time for everything"", not believable when you take soo much time to explain one very simple minigame. It has the potential to be a good collection, way larger than many others.

That presentation was just... underhwelming. Not bad, the games shown I can safely assume that are going to be enjoyable, but it had a lot of hype for it. No price announcements, no release date and the best games are cross-platform. The best showing was Pikmin 3, but why would it be the first showing. NintendoLand should have been the first.

This article reflects my own experience and opinion to some extent, but there's room for other approaches. In fact, I wrote this a few years ago after a bad experience with a hyped game, and this (especially the headline) probably represents an extreme version of my opinion even then. I don't reject scripting, just *overdone* or arbitrary scripting. [This guy on the Steam forums](http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showpost.php?p=21782650&amp;postcount=3) articulates my frustration better than myself in many ways. [This commenter](http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/smsq2/are_scripted_events_killing_gaming_an_opinion/c4ff2fn) summarizes my argument a little more succinctly. At any rate, I apologize - please don't judge this post by its title :).

---

Somebody needed to say it. A decade ago, looking forward to the future of gaming, we could see it - dynamic, highly-interactive adventures, ambitious as Hollywood blockbusters or as moving and subtle as art flicks to be played out on our TV screens, never the same way twice. We anticipated, expected a fusion of story and player choice that would become possible with the new technology we saw on the horizon. What we got in all too many cases was something else entirely.

In retrospect, it's easier to understand the proliferation of scripted events, or moments planned by a title's developers to be triggered at a particular point in a story or upon certain character actions. When used sparingly, some of these moments can be thrilling - for example, triggering the lights to dim at a particularly tense point in a horror game or scripting an ambush of Axis tanks and soldiers as your squad attempts to cross a river. Certainly some of the most memorable moments in all of gaming were written in by the developers, and nothing's going to change that.

But all too often these events become the easy way out, a way of limiting interactivity and diverting attention (and all-important budget) from the difficult parts of game design and toward sheer polish. Too much scripting turns a game into a Universal Studios ride - it makes the experience inherently artificial and kills immersion, the mental bond a user feels with a title when it creates a dynamic, fulfilling experience.

We need look no further than the venerated gods of the medium. 1998's Half-Life used scripted events early and often - for example, a headcrab would burst out of a ventilation shaft with a loud shriek or an impromptu alarm would send a squad of government soldiers running into a room with guns and explosives. Such scripting pushed the player into new and unexpected situations and often forced them to react quickly to avoid a restart.

But some of the moments were a little. . . off. Hours into the adventure, a soldier is attacked behind bulletproof glass, the player unable to save them. A scientist is snatched from a dock and dragged into the water by an enormous sea creature. Wait - they survived this long only to die at a moment calculated for maximum impact? Why aren't there bodies everywhere? How much influence can a player carry by their mere presence before it feels inescapably artificial?

Six years later, in Half-Life 2, we were still doing the same thing: Waves and waves of troops would throw themselves at you as you attempted to escort survivors across a battlefield, only to stop the moment you crossed through a door. Enemies would attack you at regular intervals as you struggled to set up security turrets to save yourself, only to stop attacking you when an ally finally managed to open a nearby door.

Did you just flip a switch? Get ready for a half-dozen wailing zombies to pop out of the murky water around you. Did you just learn something important over the radio? Here comes a tank and some soldiers! Did you just pick up the key you needed? Get ready for the ground to collapse around you and drop you into an electrified lake you have moments to escape from!

In short, it's difficult to place the logical link between picking up a new gun and summoning a missile-bearing helicopter.

When pulled to the extreme, these types of games make the hero an absurd catalyst for trouble. If every action of the hero, no matter how minor, results in attacks, story events from out of nowhere and doom to random nearby characters whose sole reason for existence is apparently to demonstrate the method of attack of a new monster, gaming isn't happening. Story isn't happening. It's an ""experience"" only in the clinical sense: A bunch of things happen and then you go home. Roll credits.

A little game called Deus Ex came out in 2000. While it wasn't as flashy or as popular as Half-Life, it did something a little different - it gave you choice. From the beginning you had a choice of taking out enemy troops discreetly or flamboyantly, and it would matter. You could run into a facility guns blazing, or hack the building's security from afar, and it would matter. Sometimes these decisions had no direct effect on the gameplay, but they still mattered because they allowed you to be creative or barbaric, play around or take things seriously. In short, and at the risk of sounding sarcastic, you were playing a game.

Characters lived or died based on your decisions, not just while you were there. Unlike Half-Life's roller coaster of arbitrary and inexplicable events, Deus Ex gave you some control over your character's role in the story. Though the game's plot proceeded more or less the same regardless of your actions, the game's best story elements weren't scripted, but were emergent from the player's personality. Whether you were a pacifist who preferred to lurk in the shadows and secret passageways and resorted to guns only when necessary (like me) or a soldier who devastated entire installations, you felt like more than a bystander. You felt like a participant. When you broke into your old facility for information and had to make the choice of either killing the security guard you'd known for the whole game or trying to outrun his weapons, the decision felt real and genuine though it wouldn't matter to the overall story. Choices like that made the game more than just a series of events and explosions.

Playing through Dead Space last week, I was surprised by how transparent and lazy the scripted elements were. The thirtieth time an enemy ran around a corner, out of sight, as you opened a door, or a character interaction with the environment caused something ""unexpected"" to happen, the impact just wasn't there. Despite Dead Space's virtues (and there were many), I felt as if the game couldn't have cared less about my participation in the story, and was perfectly happy to go on without me. The only thing that really mattered was whether I had enough health and ammo to get to Deck 19 and recalibrate the main whatchamajigger until the next crisis came up and I had to do something else. While fun, this unfortunate tendency to disrespect the player's ability to do anything other than accumulate items and shoot baddies left the experience oddly bland and unmoving.

Heavy scripting is easy, but it's a thematic dead end which creates unfulfilling experiences. Gaming's greatest strengths involve the ability of an individual to influence and interact.

* What kind of game do you *want* to play on your mobile phone?
* What core genres do you think haven't been translated well yet to mobile? What do you think is missing to make them successful? 
* What are your favorite mobile games and why do you think they are failing to attract more core gamers? 


**Explanation**

I am a game designer at a major game development studio and I specialize in mobile games. I've worked in mobile games since the flip phone days and every year I am both excited by the possibilities and depressed by the junk that rises to the top. I feel as though there is a massive community of gamers out there who own smart phones but still pretty much only play Angry Birds or hastily ported console games on their mobile devices... and I think that's because mobile game developers haven't given you all a reason to get excited about mobile yet. I think its OUR fault and I want to make it better. I don't think its because the platform is limited to shallow experiences. 

But its hard to get executives on board for a more ambitious project without either market research demonstrating demand or a comparable game performing well that they can copy-evolve into a new product. But I'm a real gamer who wants more from my mobile experiences and I'm going to do whatever it takes to create those. 

So I'm going guerrilla and hoping you all can provide me with some insights that I can use as I work towards creating something better. I need direction to help me focus market research and I need ammo to fire the next time I'm sitting across from an executive who wants to make the next great Temple Run clone.

All of the most visually striking games were clustered at the arcade, and for a single coin you could be playing the equivalent of a next gen title for a few minutes.

With the amount of power that consoles have these days and the community based features like Xbox live, we really don't have any reason to be going out to the arcade, make change, and start dropping coins into shitty light gun shooters. 

As a matter of fact, I saw a Marvel vs Capcom machine that was actually a kit with an Xbox 360 working on a timer, I didn't even get to finish both rounds before it went back to the dashboard.

I live in Portland Oregon  and luckily we have a pretty popular barcade called ground kontrol that has a bunch of vintage arcade machines (of pretty good quality) and events where they have a live band....playing rockband. It's a really cool gaming atmosphere for older gamers, but it won't do anything for the future of arcades. It's just an ode to the arcades and gamers of yesterday.

If you look at Team Fortress 2, public 12v12 or even competitive 6v6/9v9, each player has a role and if they do not fulfill that specific role, the team will lose.

In terms of basic Pub server play, If your team has no medic, but the other team does, you better get your ass on medic unless you want to make it extremely difficult for your team to win. If your team already has 3 snipers or spies, you can't just say, 'oh i can totally topscore as sniper/spy so I'll play as him.' If my team already has 1 pyro, I will gladly give up my main class to provide support/ firepower in a different way.

In competitive TF2, plays are extremely intricate. Just listening to ventrillo session of a 6v6/Highlander(9v9) team can be mind boggling the level of coordination the medic/ or captain has to orchestrate.

In contrast, look at modern shooters like COD, there is virtually 0 team responsibility. The player is a singular combat unit. You dont rely on your allies to help you push capture points, or push a cart. TDM doesn't exactly facilitate teamwork either.

~~So, I ask again, What are games where good teamwork is rewarded?~~

Example: Gunstar Super Heroes.,Hamlet7768,191,58,136,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/tl7gz/changing_the_narrative_based_on_difficulty/,"Gunstar Super Heroes is a remaquel of the Sega Genesis game Gunstar Heroes. I've heard both good and bad things about Super Heroes, but to me it was a tremendously fun game. Of course, for me the hard mode is becoming a bit of a bitch to get through, to understate my frustration (particularly with the third level). You might ask why I'm bothering, if it's so frustrating. It's because of a genius little hook they put into Gunstar Super Heroes.

Quick Note: when I say ""the Story"" with a capital S I'm referring to both playable characters' stories, which are slightly different but in a more typical way, ie one character's impulsive, the other more laid-back and sarcastic, and their responses show it, without the narrative itself changing much.

When you play the game on Easy, it's a lite-fare game, with a simplistic plot of gathering the four Macguffins and beating the crap out of bad guys to prevent some kind of armageddon being brought on by the Empire (which is their actual name in game). There are a few thematically gray elements, like the mysterious villain [sacrificing himself when all seems lost](/spoiler), but overall the Story's a pretty kid-friendly narrative, and it's easy to boot.

When you go to Normal mode, a few things change. First off, you have less health to start off, and enemies are a bit tougher and smarter. For example, enemies with mounted machine guns can tilt them down to hit you from higher spots. However, the Story also changes: it's a bit darker. We start to learn more about the characters' back stories, things that were only murmured about in Easy mode. Notably, [one of the NPC heroes sacrifices herself instead of her brother, the aforementioned ""mysterious villain""](/spoiler).

Hard mode takes this darkness and puts into the limelight, clashing with the cartoony graphics. The snappy, cheesy one-liners are gone, and some really dark themes come into play (one big one being whether you're even on the right side in fighting the Empire). It's surprisingly compelling, building on the Story-lite from Easy and Normal modes to make something surprisingly good for an arcade-style run and gun game, to the point of almost being overwrought, considering the only plot you really need is the Easy mode plot/excuse to blow stuff up (and may I say that EVERYTHING blows up in this game).

Anyway, I found the idea of having a more complex and interesting narrative as a ""reward"" for higher difficulty interesting, as well as a gateway to making the game more appealing on more levels than just KABOOM BOOM BLAMMO shenanigans.

Player-placed waypoints are nothing new, and they're certainly a useful tool to have.

Some games alleviate this problem, either through additions to the HUD or with in-game markers.

In the discussion, a member (to be honest, me) brought up annoyance with the idea of one-class-one-character.  This, as many can imagine, stems from playing MMO's from MUDs to Ultima Online, Everquest, FF11, WoW, an dozens of others.

In three of the examples above, you create a character, select a class, and play.  In UO you didn't exactly select a class per se, but close enough.  Then I picked up FFXI.  I don't know if others did it first, but this was the first MMORPG that let me create a character, and then do with it as I pleased, when I pleased.  If I got tired of leveling job X, I could switch to job Q and level that one.

This concept changed the way I saw my character.  No longer was my character just the job, it was my virtual self.  The way Square allowed me to experience the entirety of the game with a singular character generated a true attachment that I didn't feel in the other games.  I didn't feel it for my WoW characters, either.  They were just their class.  

So many MMORPGs that come out now, and are slated for the future, continue to further the one-character-one-class premise.  I, personally, feel that if FF11 and FF14 had made a bigger and longer splash that the idea could have taken a greater foothold, but that did not happen.

Do you feel strongly for one system over the other?  Could you see a way that the two systems could co-exist in a market with both games being alive and active?

Batman has been around 70 years. Comic book characters are revamped over and over and over again. They're retold constantly, kind of like a modern equivalent of the oral storytelling tradition of mythology. 

Many video games repeat in a similar way. That's a huge part of the Final Fantasy and Zelda series. 

Now of course not all video games do this. Particularly in western developers you tend to have more arc based stories with a finite stretching point. And technology changes, and so games series are constantly going in and out of fashion. Sonic has been nearly beaten to death, and despite it being the 25th Megaman anniversary, you don't see a single game coming out for it this year. Even so I think we can probably expect new games to be coming out for those series. 

 Zelda, Metroid, Megaman, Castlevania, alot of these games have just celebrated their 25th anniversaries. That's a quarter of a century. I would bet they're probably going to stick around for awhile longer. 

What I would like to discuss is a little more specific than ""What is the future of gaming/these franchises?"" I'd like to take the discussion further. 

It's a given that the tech and game design mechanic innovations are going to change, and trying to predict is going to be hard. So what is going to be the future of these games from *narrative and mythos* perspective. 

Think about how [Batman has changed in 70 years](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_versions_of_Batman). Pulpy villians of the week, campy weird TV shows, gimmicky gadgets, brooding macho psychopaths, deep character driven stories. There's this deep well of history behind this character, just acquired over time. 

Where do you think the video game equivalents might go? What would it feel like to watch your great-grandkids play the newest Zelda game? Or hell you play it with them. The name Hero of Time takes on a new meaning, eh? Or Final Fantasy XXVI. That was a hidden joke in Deus Ex, but that might actually come out someday.

It is frustrating that most everything is so binary and linear nowadays.

Fallout / New Vegas has a bunch of binary states in the ending video (Saved the dog or didn't, Blew up the city or didn't).  But each mission / quest is pretty independent, linear, and a simple ""pass/fail"" at the end.

Some games have individual quests that have a more graduated outcome (not simply ""success"" or ""fail"") but don't necessarily have the same impact in storytelling that failing a mission or two in Wing Commander did.

What I loved about Wing Commander was that even after failing a mission, a lot of times you didn't want to re-load your game because ""failing"" was in itself revealing more of the story and interactions.

It seems like I miss the old ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" style storytelling where two people might play the same game but have a very different path through it.

Playing through Skyrim now and the variety seems to come in ""which faction do you progress linearly through"" and because failing any random mission doesn't have any consequences there is no incentive or consequence for not passing it.

I think I would really like a game where you were expected to fail a certain percentage of missions or it was ""impossible"" to pass all of the challenges that were thrown your way... and depending on the ones you passed or didn't impacted the story that you end up experiencing.

Briefly going back to Skyrim- when you're a very low level, even the spiders in the woods are super-dangerous and while running to avoid them, you might end up discovering some other part of the world to explore and level up in until you are able to go back to accomplishing what you set out to do.

For some final closure, here's [an analysis of some ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" books](http://samizdat.cc/cyoa/) that's surely a repost of some kind but quite enlightening to compare to current ""state of the art"" in video games.

1361876124.0,128,self.truegaming,1994zx,Not dumbing down: RPG's and abstraction ,Roywocket,195,67,227,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1994zx/not_dumbing_down_rpgs_and_abstraction/,"Dumbing down has become this universal complaint that gets a pulled out whenever we see new releases of any game in a long running series. At the very least there will be a nod or a test of ""did they dumb down the series?"". Now off course this complaint has a basis in reality. Some games have sacrificed depth in the process of making the games available to bigger audiences. Lowering the bar of entry has cost many projects their gameplay depth, however what games and and how bad that was is ultimately a subjective thing. If we are to take an example of my personal preference I would say that most of the changes for the new ""Xcom: EU"" was for the better. 

Because Dumbing down is this universal complaint is brought out the definition of it isn't crystal clear. Especially since it is used as a negative in an effort to show disapproval with changes in general. Hence why I am just clearing up what I define as dumbing down before getting to the crux of my argument.

One of the main targets the the dumbing down complaint will often be RPGs. Now this isn't unheard of since RPG have roots in fairly complicated rulesets, so the idea of simplifying the rules in order to give new players leeway isn't a bad one in principal. However the history of RPG's is what is at the core of the issue at hand.

From their beginnings RPG's was based on abstractions of physical representations. The idea of measuring strength or dexterity as a number means that number represent the targets physical attributes. Again that means a disconnect between the player and the char. The players own input becomes almost completely irrelevant.  

With more available computing power we were able to make visual simulations dependent on our input. Where we before had a dice roll to see if our attack hit or missed dependent on our sword skill, we now had direct control over how well we aim or dodge. A dodge does no longer have to be determined on a dice roll, but instead on your ability to move your char out of the way. Same way you chance to block can be simulated directly to your input as opposed to a numerical representation.  The most obvious clash of these 2 designs is in a game like Morrowind. You are given the ability to control input on dodging and striking, but but are still largely determined by an internal dice roll. Leading to episodes where players are repeatedly pressing a mudcrab with a sword in an effort to get the dice roll come up as a hit.

Now this I believe is at the core of the problems of our modern day attempts at RPG's. It is not a case of RPG's dumbing down because they moved away from the use of stats, but the application of the stats of the past that have become obsolete as we got the calculating power simulate what we before had to represent by an abstract value. Much of the confusion of course comes from not all stats become obsolete. Something like strength/power is still best represented by an abstract value since you cant really push a button harder for better effect (thou motion controls have been touching on this).

This is why it is so hard to make good RPG combat using guns. A gun is a tool designed to be solely dependent on a users accuracy, focus and perception. All of which can be applied directly from player input.

Now I am just going to throw in a disclaimer here. I absolutely love the abstract combat style of play. My personal favorite genre of all time is Turn based strategy. The whole of point I am getting at isn't that one is better than the other or that we cant have both, but the that the 2 designs are different and not necessarily compatible.

Now some RPG's manages to rework the old abstract elements into this new generation of calculation power. A game like Dark Souls reworked a lot of the stats into a resource management element (You have X time to do Y and increase in stat Z will increase the speed you can do Y).

Either way looking at it this, way to often it is not a case of RPG's dumbing down. It is just finding its way into a new generation of a available calculating power and player input. And while the abstract combat has its value and we can have both, it is just silly to expect that game design wont move forward with its available technology.

And do you agree with it?,bushdoc,200,71,88,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/167bqd/why_did_jfk_reloaded_create_so_much_controversy/,"[*JFK: Reloaded*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JFK:_Reloaded) is definitely worth playing. It is interesting, fun, and a good example how people treat videogames differently than other media. The overblown controversy led the developer to end sales shortly after it released. Now it's [available as abandonware](http://facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=921612). 

Even some gamers who have killed countless innocent NPC's in other games, draw the line at shooting a virtual JFK. But the reason they object to the game so strongly is jumping to conclusions after only hearing the concept. 

These are the reasons I think most people object, and how those reasons are flawed:

* **It's disrespectful to create a game based on a real-life tragedy.** But many games are loosely based on real conflicts, and come up with fake names for countries (Like ""Zekistan"" from *Full Spectrum Warrior* or ""Adjikistan"" from *SOCOM*). I argue that if a game is based on a real event, it shows more respect to represent it accurately and give players a chance to learn something about it. There are many WWII strategy games that take this route and never cause the reaction that *JFK: Reloaded* did.

*Digital Spy* has a great [article](http://www.digitalspy.ca/gaming/news/a401660/backlash-to-reality-should-war-games-be-based-on-real-events.html) about this issue, and how EA aimed for authenticity when representing Somali Pirates in *MOH Warfighter*. 

* **It's wrong to put players in Lee Harvey Oswald's shoes** The idea of playing this event from the ""bad guy's"" perspective makes people uncomfortable. It reminds me of the [Medal of Honor Taliban controversy](http://www.joystiq.com/2010/10/11/medal-of-honor-marketing-director-explains-taliban-removal/). But there are many great games that put players in the shoes of the ""bad guys"", (*Silent Hunter 3* comes to mind). 

I think part of this concern is based on the old, simplistic argument that first person shooters can turn kids into mass murderers.  

* ***JFK: Reloaded* depicts the killing of the most beloved modern president**, and people feel it's wrong to take any entertainment from that. But most people don't have the same reaction to Oliver Stone's film JFK, which creates entertainment from the same subject. 

Also, *JFK: Reloaded* was billed as a ""docu-game"". The game's developer said they hoped it could get a new generation interested in this event, and inspire them to learn more about it for themselves. So it's not just killing the president for fun. To be fair, players are free to have fun, by shooting anyone they want. But that freedom doesn't take away from the innovation of a ""docu-game"" recreating such an important moment, even while it's still a sensitive subject.

 Some games use a controversial topic merely for the shock value, but *JFK: Reloaded* is not one of them. **I would like to hear whether truegaming agrees, disagrees, or has any more reasons why this game drew so much negative attention.** I am researching this topic as a possible feature article for a videogame news site.

Controllers are your conduit to your avatar, rendering it as one of the most essential elements of gaming. A bad controller ruins your gaming experience; a good controller simply allows it. They're taken for granted, in my opinion, and their extensive history oft-overlooked (see Damien Lopez link and [here](http://www.videogameconsolelibrary.com/art-controller.htm#page=early)).

There are a lot of them (see [here](http://i.imgur.com/EjuBS.gif) and [here](http://i.imgur.com/b2OGs.jpg) (from Damien Lopez)), and we all have preferences.

Personally, my favorite controller was the [PS2 Logitech Cordless Precision](http://i.imgur.com/zr6pX.gif). Solid buttons, superb analog sticks, nice weight, and nice trigger buttons - yet the PS3 version of it is terrible (uncharacteristic for Logitech), sporting mushy shoulder buttons, no SIXAXIS, and rumble support that has disappeared after a PS3 firmware patch.

I'm not happy with any one controller. I play the PS3 and am disappointed in third party options. [This Power A controller](http://i.imgur.com/60Tyx.jpg) would be cool for variety if there wasn't a huge dead zone in the analog sticks.

Why aren't there controllers that can be customized? At least give consumers a couple of options for the core controller! Make an option with the analog stick and D-Pad switched, Sony! (I'd rail on Microsoft, too, but I haven't enough experience with the 360's controller to do so knowledgeably)

Some topics of discussion:

* How often do you replace or maintenance your controllers? I have an Assassin's Creed controller - the R1 and X buttons are worn out; I have a shooter/action game controller, where the R1 button is a bit wobbly.

* Would you consider maintenance on your own controller? Personally, I don't have the time/patience to order parts, replace springs, mess with screws, and I think the controllers are too expensive to justify getting new ones - mine work pretty well. I've replaced one DS3 before with two other DS3's, and switching between the two allows me to disperse wear.

* Do you customize your controller - buttons, [triggers](http://imgur.com/wHgXu), paint jobs, etc?

* What's your favorite controller, and why?

So, yesterday, there was an update to the [Wasteland 2 kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/inxile/wasteland-2/) (which, by the way, ends in less than 24 hours, so go and pledge if you haven't yet). 

The game will be released for Windows, Mac and Linux. Among other things, it was explained that by ""Digital Downloadable copy of game DRM free for PC or MAC OSX or Linux"" developers mean ""exclusive or"". That is, the backers have to choose one operating system and only get a single-OS version. If you want to play on a Windows desktop and on a MacBook, well then, you'll have to buy the game twice.

There have been quite a discussion in the comments on kickstarter. Some (me included) argue that if the game is going to be DRM-free and a person can install it on as many computers as they like, it makes no sense to introduce arbitrary OS-related restrictions. I don't even remember any examples where a simultaneous multi-OS release forced users to buy different versions separately. I do remember quite a lot of examples of the opposite (HIB, SteamPlay, etc).

The opponents claim that since it costs more to develop for multiple OSes, it should cost more to play under multiple OSes. I don't buy this argument, for a few reasons. One, I'm pretty sure it doesn't cost twice as much to port the game to a different OS. Two, the main profit for cross-platform releases comes from people who use Mac or Linux exclusively. Only a small minority will actually use several versions; there is just no benefit to be found by nickel-and-diming them. What there is, though, is a bad PR.

Another argument against is that the game is already so cheap, that you could buy 2 copies and still pay less than the cost of a regular game. I don't think this has anything to do with the issue at hand. It's not about money, it's about what's fair. If the developers priced their game at $15, it should still cost $15 no matter what combination of operating systems a gamer uses.

**TL;DR**: if you buy a game, do you expect to get all Windows/Linux/Mac versions (assuming they exist) at the same time?

I am a political scientist from Canada, with a certain interest in political ideas and political thought. I am also a huge gamer. This leads to the fact that I always loved the Bioshock series. The first Bioshock, as far as I am concerned, was a revelation. It was creating a virtual thought experiment. It started with the premise that someone created a libertarian society, and let it run its course to see where it went. It was a beautiful, interactive experiment meant to teach players about a political philosophy, and push them to think about such questions while being a very enjoyable experience for its own sake. 

In this sense, Bioshock 2 was a little disappointing, in the sense that a collectivistic ideology was tacked on Rapture, which made it a thought experiment of collectivism on an already half-destroyed libertarian dystopia rather than about collectivism on its own. This being said, let's move on to Bioshock 3. 

I was really happy when I saw the first trailer for Bioshock 3. I thought that since we would discover a new setting, we would have the chance to see a ""pure"" thought experiment again. The fact that it targeted so obviously American Exceptionalism was also fantastic to me. Unlike the two other ideologies, it was extremely contemporary, and I was very eager to see how my neighbors from south of the border would react to the content of the game. 

Admittedly, I have been a little disappointed by the (lack of) political philosphy in the game. I found that after the initial sequence, the game veered into quantum physics/parallel universes and adopted a relatively postmodern stance that basically amounted to ""all systems are the same. It doesn't matter.""

Nevertheless, I'm still very interested in hearing what you guys, especially American gamers, have thought about the elements of American Exceptionalism found in the game? Did it hit close to home? Did you find it relevant for today's political discourse? Any other reactions to the political elements in the game?

What are some examples of game remakes (or spiritual successors) that successfully 'jump genres' while maintaining the core of what made the original a good game?

During the death throes of the point-and-click adventure game, I feel a lot of games were made that were in denial about what they were.

The control scheme in Grim Fandango felt silly. The gameplay was functionally identical to earlier Lucasarts point-and-click adventure titles. The fact that you had to pilot your character around via the arrow keys felt like a pointless minigame that you had to play all the time. It felt to me like an attempt to trick potential buyers into thinking it was one of the third-person 3D platformers that were popular at the time. 

Planescape: Torment can be played almost entirely without combat, and IMO this appears to be the 'correct' way to play it. The combat doesn't have the strategic depth of Baldur's Gate or Icewind Dale, and the itemization doesn't provide the same progressive impulse. These points are debatable, but I think it's fairly clear that you could turn the game into a straight-up dialogue-based point-and-click while maintaining virtually everything that made it great.

(Tangentially: I love it when games admit multiple playstyles, provided they do so successfully. I am a big fan of some modern action games that apparently try to provide an 'adventure mode' play option. I was able to have a quite successful playthrough in Fallout: New Vegas with a character having STR 1, CON 1, and no weapon specialization, relying on dialogue, companions, and VATS.)

Let me first come out and say this first - Different difficulty settings in games are a good thing. With gaming being a very rapid expanding medium for entertainment it will obviously be attracting new people that try out gaming. As well as the fact that some people are just plain better and games then others, different difficulty settings help broaden the range of accessibility to everyone, which allows for a wider more numerous population.

There is something I have noticed in gaming however, and this most recently occurred to me while I was just playing through Fallout:New Vegas. After finishing the game once through I decided to start a new game and try a different character build as well as try the next difficulty up. What I noticed during the first ""big moment"" of the game (defending the town) was that the enemies I was facing were not more ""difficult"", but rather they all seem to have metal for skin. 

After the mission ended I realized how many shots it took to kill someone, even with well placed head shots as well as VATS assisted shots. While shooting them it made me realize right away that I was in fact playing a video game, rather then experiencing a story. 

This is of course the standard in almost any game though when you increase the difficulty. The bad guys do not get smarter, more accurate, work together, or use tactics, they act the exact same way on previous difficulties, but can just take a lot more hits, and in some cases, you can't take as many. I remember this being the way all the way back to when I first played the first Halo and my brother and I were trying to clear Legendary difficulty for the first time. It was not that the enemies were better then us, they were simply stronger than us. 

To me this takes away from the players experience with the game, and becomes to ""video gamey"" if that makes sense. I love hard games and I enjoy a challenge, but I would like to see some games change how they do the difficulty system. I wonder what it would be like if a game developer made different levels of AI for the different settings. I feel like this would be a truly more difficult setting rather then making all the enemies made of iron. Back to my New Vegas example, it should not take 6 head shots to down a unarmored wasteland wanderer. That makes me very aware I am playing a game, especially when he is running at me with a baseball bat and shrugging of bullets like BB's.

This feels like it changed everything. Now they have countless, or if I may, infinite possibilities for storylines that they can come up with. All they need to do is again set the constants like the lighthouse, a visionary, charismatic man and that feeling of daughter/father relationship that seems to permeat through all Bioshock games.

Silent protagonist.,chrismikehunt,179,58,169,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1a58sr/fellow_rpg_fans_voiced_vs_silent_protagonist/,"There seems to be a bigger divide than I expected on this subject. I was wondering how people here felt, and also hope to see some good points both for and against each option.

 Personally, I find a silent protagonist vastly preferable to a voiced one. Unfortunately with the advances in gaming it now seems voiced is the norm. 

 The reason for preferring silent is purely from an immersion factor. The majority of RPGs give you dialogue options to chose. I will sit there and read them all through before deciding what I want to chose. I have read that text in my head, to then hear it spoken back to me again, in a different voice and or tone than I had given it in my head just takes me out of the immersion. Reminds me that this is someone else's tale being told not my own. 

 The Mass Effect games have given me the most enjoyment from a voiced protagonist so far, purely because the dialogue you chose was only a small snippet of what was said so it wasn't a case of hearing the same things over. But the flip-side of this, as many of you will have experienced, is that what is said is not always what you wanted/expected to have been said. I felt that it made me feel more like I was playing a sci-fi movie where I had vague interaction with the cut scenes more so than I was completely absorbed in my character.

I had to have it. Bought it, downloaded it, installed it, playing it. Something caught my eye while I was setting up and about to make my characters (or was it after I made my characters?): it gives you the option to turn off the auto-map feature for a more bare bones adventure experience (it even tells you to get the graph paper out! I ran to my cabinet and grabbed a whole STACK from my D&amp;D notebook). 

  Intrigued, I did it. Remembering my days on the original Zork, Wizardry games (particularly Heart of the Maelstrom which had like... 9,001 levels or maybe that's a hyperbole) and the frustration/sense of accomplishment that came with mapping out my movements, marking down where I found traps, treasures, Big Bads. Then I started playing the game and after about an hour.. completely forgot to map out where I was going (I'm getting old! Don't judge me!). I got lost. Horribly lost. And no automap to save me. I stuck it out until I got killed (oh.. permadeath like the old games?! Woops.).

  Then I created new characters. A new party for the adventure. I turned that there auto-map **on**. I don't understand it, maybe I'm older now with more on my mind (two year old running around, wife, pets, bills, work, etc) and subconsciously don't **want** to do the extra work... or Auto-mapping is a necessary, and great feature, for adventure games. What does /r/truegaming think? And apologies if this is in the wrong place.

It used to be that first the initial game is released and people buy and probably like what they bought and based on sales and demand something along the lines of ""stuff packs, mission packs, full addons, etc."" were provided.

The current situation is that you have a wide array of different editions as well as DLCs right from the release date. I don't know about others, but it seems like people generally want the version with ""the most stuff"" because they want to get ""the full experience"" (I find myself amongst them). So - at least to me- it feels like being ripped off of this exact experience.

What follows is that I don't know how important or unimportant any of the DLCs is with regards to the overall story, which ultimately leads to me thinking that none of them matter. As an analogy, take Starcraft and its expansion Brood War. After playing Starcraft it was quite clear that if you wanted the full story you would have to go ahead an play Brood War.

**tldr;**

Today I don't know if DLCs are made so unimportant that they don't matter or are in fact important to even grasp what is going on in the bigger picture. And what's worse is that it feels like I have to make that decision on or even before release date.

I recently got a bit of guff when it was revealed that I used to play WoW. However, the main surprise came when people found out that I had a female avatar. I had never thought of it as weird, but being pointed out as weird for using a chick rather than a dude actually got me thinking. (Thinking about something other than beer &amp; Minecraft, it was a feat)

Was there any reason why a straight, mid 20's male like myself ever want to use a female character. I've heard a couple of responses from the rather base ""If I'm going to look at an ass for 20 hours, it might as well be nice and womanly"" to the rather odd ""I'm roleplaying. I like it this way""

Now, Granted, there are some gamers who just go for the prize and not care about stories, emotion or pacing and want to just get straight into shoving chainsaws into inappropriate places, and I can respect that, and that's where the first argument can fit.

However, after a fair amount of thought I came to the conclusion about myself on this one, and it's kinda disconcerting.

I personally play as a chick because of the fact that nearly every male character in nearly every game (RPG's are guilty too, just not all of them) is built like a tank. Even if you're meant to be a stealthy hunter, a sniper expert, they're all far too macho, voiced too macho, and really don't fit into any play style that I prefer to use. (Sniper specialist or rouge)

So it begs the question (The main question) Why does gaming, as a culture, need to be populated by such excessive characterisations of masculinity? Are we all so insecure in our own sexuality that we need to reminded of this?

Just saying is all.

**TL;DR: Opinion: Modern games are reinforcing over-masculine male characters, and the lack of any choice is what drives me to play as a female character. Discuss**

I thank you in advance for your time and comments.
_________________

The fairy tale paradigm is one that is, amusingly, as old as time. The archetypes of a knight, a princess, and a dragon are some of the oldest and most well worn archetypes of the storytelling world. A knight has to rescue a princess who is helplessly trapped by some opposition, oftentimes a witch or a dragon (for the sake of simplicity, I will refer to this archetype simply as “the dragon,” given that is the most iconic symbol of opposition, though this role could also be filled by a witch, a troll, or some other such being). The knight is always trustworthy and honorable, the princess always beautiful, the dragon always menacing and mean, and the love is always pure and true.

It is not hard to see why this paradigm is so rampant. In video games, the player always makes assumptions about the game, both through visual interpretation and through the nature of the medium. Just like any other medium, a gigantic spiny creature is going to be perceived as “evil,” but in video games, that perception is further enhanced by the achievement of killing said creature. In most video games, beating a level or killing a boss is considered a good thing, an achievement worth celebrating, and thus most players assume that when they get to the next level or kill the boss, they are making the virtual world a better place. This notion and the satisfaction of the game is reinforced when it follows the fairy tale paradigm closely because the players’ ideas of what is supposed to happen are reinforced by the games’ archetypes.

Yet it is possibly because of this historic acceptance of the fairy tale paradigm that some video games strive to go against it. Notably, Shadow of the Colossus plays against these stereotypes to create a world that is less black and white (despite the grim color palette) and play off the player’s assumptions of what is good and what is bad.

 

The Knight

The game opens up with the main character taking the Princess, unconscious and presumably dead, to a temple in the middle of a dead and barren land. He lays her body on a pedestal and listens to an ethereal voice tell him to kill several colossi, which is supposed to save the Princess. He, of course, listens to the voice and proceeds throughout the game to actually kill the colossi.

The first apparent subversion of the paradigm is apparent in the character, referred to only as “The Wanderer” by the game’s creators. He has a sword, a bow, and a horse, but he does not use them like the knights of past fairy tales. He can barely swing the sword, losing his center of balance each time he swings on land. His horse and him have a special bond, but his horse acts less like a tool of the rider and more like an organic being. They journey through the game as partners and not as master and servant. He can shoot a bow, but beyond the various wildlife in the countryside, he never hurts anyone or anything seriously with it.

He can also do various tricks with his horse, such as standing on top of it while riding or other such actions. He can go hunting with his bow and kill lizards with it. He can do a dive into a lake from a far distance, actually assuming a diving pose. Yet none of these actions actually matter.

These actions also show off just how different this character is from the archetype of a knight. He is specifically not a warrior, unable to do any serious damage with his weapons except for when he reaches several small weak spots. By all rights, he should not win. He is also not gruff and tough like a warrior normally is portrayed as. The amusing curiosities and distractions that the Wanderer partakes in are not the actions of someone focused on an end goal, but rather the actions of one who is easily distracted, who has a natural curiosity, who acts in many ways like a child. He is a child focused on one goal, saving the Princess, but he is a child nonetheless. This naivety will come back later in the game.

The Dragons

The colossi in this game are unlike most other game bosses. They are threatening, for sure, but they are often beautiful too. The lumber around like living monuments, buildings that are overgrown with moss and ivy that have somehow been given life. Except for a few of them, they are mostly slow and deliberate, seeming to calculate every move. They moan and groan as if they are actually old men who have not left their houses for a long time. They seem to carry around history on their back and in their limbs.

There are some exceptions, some relatively tiny and small, like a large lion rather than a building, but for the most part, they are dramatically majestic towers of ruins. The only way the player can actually kill them is by scurrying up their sides clumsily and stabbing them, also rather clumsily, in glowing weak spots. Whereas the main character is displayed as someone young and naive, new to the world and occupying only a small part of it, these giants embody the desolate world around them. They have been here for quite a while and do not simply live in the land; they are part of the land.

These colossi fulfill the role of the Dragon accurately enough. They are the obstacle that keeps the Princess from her Knight, and many of them are quite frightening. Some even look like dragons.

But there is another layer beyond the obvious visual layer. The colossi are clearly aggressive. Many, upon the sight of the player, will raise up their weapons, bare their claws, or fire upon them in violent ways. But the key is that they are not the invader. They do not play the Dragon that comes and kidnaps the Princess while destroying the kingdom. If anything, that is the player’s job, who comes into a land and kills the colossi, also killing a living, moving, part of the land.

Eventually, the main character stops seeming like the Noble Knight. The colossi are portrayed as too beautiful, too historic, for that to be the case. Instead, the player is almost raping the land, going through colossus after colossus, to get what he wants. The temple with the Princess begins to fill up with rubble where there used to be statues.

Furthermore, after killing a colossus, the player is infected with a black essence that is freed from the colossus. This essence is never explained, and the player has no idea what it is doing to the main character throughout the game. However, the black essence does not seem to be helping the main character at all. The Wanderer coughs and then passes out after each infection. The infection raises poses several questions to the audience, “How does killing a colossus help his cause?” “Is killing a colossus good?” “What is happening to the Wanderer?” The game purposefully does not answer these questions, instead silently encouraging the player to stop the killing. However, both the player and the main character know that they will not stop the killing because they want to get what they want. In this way, the game is making a comment on both the character’s treatment of the colossi and the player’s willingness to kill beauty in order to “win” the game.

The Princess

The final element of the paradigm is the Princess. In the game, the Princess is completely unconscious for the vast majority of the game. She is literally put on a pedestal in a temple that the main character comes back to after he kills a colossus. She does not speak, does not move, and does not do anything except look pretty.

The Princess is not a real person; she is an ideal. She is the embodiment of beauty, of love, but she is not a developed character. She is what the main character thinks of as love, but the player has no reason to love her or to think that their relationship is real. In fact, because the main character acts like a naive child, the player has a reason to believe that the main character’s desire for her is not based on anything real. After all, the Wanderer is not old, wise, or down to earth. He looks like a little child climbing up the colossi: a small boy in a world much larger and much more intricate than him.

This idealization of the Princess is carried out in the final scene of the game when the main character, completely corrupted and covered with darkness, struggles to reach the Princess while being dragged into a well by a spell. The game intelligently lets the player control the Wanderer at this point and not just make it a cutscene, thus allowing the player to attempt to reach the Princess, reach the ideal, but ultimately fail. The final scene is a commentary on the failings of idealization and the unfortunate blindness that comes from romantic love. Like Romeo, his love for the Princess led him to make the ultimate sacrifice without even realizing what he was doing.

However, Shadow of the Colossus has one more subtle twist. After all the colossi are killed, after the Wanderer becomes completely corrupted, after he gets sucked into a spell, the Princess actually wakes up. She gets up and there is no one around except for the Wanderer’s horse. Who leads her to a baby.

Here is where Shadow of the Colossus manages to both critique and celebrate the ideals of the Wanderer. For even though the Wanderer’s quest for love led him to corruption, even though it led to the destruction of the colossi, even though it led him to his own apparent death, something was born out of it. It is not clear what was born exactly, but there is something. That something is new life, which could lead to just about anything. It is not perfect. There are horns reflecting the nature of its birth. But it is something.


In all its subversion and critique, Shadow of the Colossus does not throw out the ideals it critiques. It subverts idealistic love, but it does not claim that it is worthless. In the same way that Romeo and Juliet’s passionate love affair was incredibly naive and ultimately deadly, the Wanderer’s love led to the destruction of the landscape and of himself. In each case, however, the works end with a note of hope. Romeo and Juliet’s deaths led to the ending of a historic family feud. The Wanderer’s love was unrealistic and idealistic, but something came out of it. The Wanderer was blinded by his ambitions, but something came out of it. The Wanderer did many things that he should not have, but something came out of it. Whether or not that something was worth the trials and sacrifices is really left up to the audience.",,False,,t5_2sgq6,False,,,True,t3_12dl8p,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/12dl8p/shadow_of_the_colossus_and_the_subversion_of_the/,

I believe this scepticism may be driven by the newfound awkwardness of consoles as they continue to advance (and not merely for the reasons of lagging specifications). As consoles evolve, we have less what we used to - luxury toys for home entertainment - and now more constricted computers with aims towards home entertainment. The boundaries between the console and the home computer are becoming more blurred - they are both powerful devices with a high degree of networking functionality. However, what we see now is the PC outstripping consoles in an age of increased user functionality. Consoles present us with a prescriptive OS, boundaries, strict monitoring in the form of DRM, and an awkward fusion of the PC and the home gaming consoles of last generation. It is a device that would hope to replace your computer for gaming and entertainment, yet freedom is limited. As people are becoming more and more aware of the limits of monitoring users through their systems, I perceieve a shift back to the PC. Freedom there is not absolute, but it is greater - offering customisation and personalisation that people are stripped of with console. This is by no means an anti-console rant - I have owned and loved consoles since I was eight years old. But I am also making the shift. And I think it is because we perceive that consoles at current are unsure of what they are, particularly on the cusp of a new generation which is seeking to propagate unpopular technologies and whose specifications seem to be mirroring PC.

My goal with this post is to hopefully increase awareness and excitement for the Feb. 7, 2012 release of this Action RPG (ARPG). 

*(Housekeeping: I have no affiliation with the makers of Reckoning...I'm just an excited gamer and confused as to why this game isn't on the tip of every ARPG gamer's tongue. Also, being that this isn't the type of post that is usually appropriate for /r/truegaming, it has been preapproved by the mods.)*

First things first...I'll just assume that you don't know anything about the game, Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning, henceforth to be referred to simply as Reckoning. These three videos will give you a good introduction to the game (if you just want to watch one, go for the first one):

So why am I writing this? Why am I promoting a game that I am not associated with? In short, I want it to do well. I want it to do so well that it changes the landscape of ARPGs. For far too long developers have neglected combat and treated it as something secondary. Those of us that love Action RPGs have been silently told by developers, ""If you want combat, go play God of War or Ninja Gaiden. If you want stats and skill trees, combat is going to suck."" Well, Reckoning bucks this *tradition*. It is the first game to try to do all four of the main RPG elements well: 

* Narative

* Exploration

* Advancement

* **Combat**

But the most important thing is that the creators are not going to the opposite extreme and saying ""Let's focus exclusively on combat"". Instead, the team that has come together for this project is incredible.

The ""visionary"" for Reckoning is none other than [Ken Rolston](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Rolston), lead designer of Morrowind and Oblivion. That should be enough to get anyone excited. For the universe of Amalur, Big Huge Games brought in as their ""Creative Director"" New York Times best selling author [R. A. Salvator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._A._Salvatore). They also brought in as ""Art Boss"" the creator of the Spawn comic book series, [Todd McFarlane](http://www.ea.com/news/kingdoms-of-amalur-reckoning-interview-with-todd-mcfarlane). 

Let's take a look at what makes the combat extraordinary for such a large (approximately the size of Oblivion), open-world game. This eight minute video features discussion of a lot of what the combat has to offer, but you can skip to 7:00 if you just want to get to the meat:

* [Inside Reckoning: Combat ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=kyu38nXLcko)

This is the closest that we have to a God of War style combat system that I've ever seen in a full-featured RPG. There are a number of combat elements in the video that really stand out:

* Dodge roll and parry

* Fast and fluid strikes

* There is ""weight"" behind the attacks

* Accuracy in the strikes

* Risk/Reward system in the power of the strikes

* Cancel regular attacks into block/roll/magic! Fuck yeah!

* Context sensitive attacks -- attack out of dodge, attack out of block

* Air launcher! Fuck yeah!

* Teleport

* Change weapons mid combo

* Timing-based combos

There are, of course, some concerns. Did they bite off more than they can chew? As someone with a GOW, Ninja Gaiden, and Demon's Souls background, will the combat be challenging enough? 


I've really only scratched the surface on this game. It seems to have everything from GOW-like combat, to Mass Effect-type conversations, to Elder Scrolls-type crafting (even deeper than Skyrim--5 components to use in crafting each item), to Diablo-type slotting and crafting of gems. This is the game I have been waiting for my entire life. 

If you'd like more information about the game, [Gamefaqs.com](http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/991144-kingdoms-of-amalur-reckoning/60566197) has a great sticky thread with a lot of information and links to other videos.

I've played and beaten Fallout: NV the whole way through on PC and fucking loved it.  I loved it more than Fallout 3 which I could only get a quarter of the way through before becoming bored and horny.

While I no longer have a PC, I was hoping to find a nice PS3 package containing all the extra content so I can pop it in my system and play and this is where I noticed that people said there will never be a ""GOTY"" or ""Hits"" package because the game sucks and it's a disgrace to the series.

It's one of few games that has come out recently that has held my attention and came at a point in which I actually felt like video games maybe no longer interested me.

Mass Effect has some nice commentary on the political process, and quite a lot can be seen analogous to the world today or its history.

Many games that are released in today's gaming world (particularly Nintendo games) are sequels, prequels, mid-quels, what have you. Most of these games have to consider what events have occurred in previous entries, how characters have changed or evolved, etc. If the newer game had taken liberties with the story that weren't considered ""canon"", or didn't settle for the limitations that previous entries had established, how would you feel? Does it matter if it is a beloved franchise, or if the series was ""your childhood""?


Gaming is unique from movies or books in that in most cases you are driving the main character towards their goals by your own actions. Are you more invested in a game's story because you are experiencing it along with the main character? Perhaps the long development periods of games and the limitations of previous generations have an affect. Star Wars has a long established history on film, and so fans of that universe take the continuity quite seriously. Does an official timeline REALLY make the Legend of Zelda series feel more connected for you, even if the developers of older games had no idea what kind of framework they would be working towards in the future?


I have mixed feelings about the topic. In series like Metal Gear Solid or Halo, I consider the continuity pretty important. The games' stories are a huge part of why they are appealing, and so if huge changes to the story were made to disregard previous story elements or events, it would be upsetting. In contrast to that, some series simply do not take their own stories very seriously. I am talking about series like Metroid, Mortal Kombat, or Legend of Zelda. These are games that DO have a story, and sometimes are quite good, but the focus of the game is not usually on finding out what happens story-wise. Gameplay drives these games, and story is somewhat of an afterthought. If big changes were made to the story or ""continuity"" of these games, I would be fine with it to an extent. Change is good, and because Gameplay is the focus, that is what I'd really care about.",,False,,t5_2sgq6,False,,,True,t3_1hnjzl,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1hnjzl/how_important_is_game_continuity_to_you/,

Once I got into PC gaming, I noticed the learning curve for multiplayer games going up sharply.  My cousin recently guided me to level 20 in World of Warcraft, and he thought it was much more entertaining to impart his knowledge of the game to me so I could play better.  This is where my idea happens.

I tried playing games like Dota 2, League of Legends, Counter-Strike and other multiplayer games, but I found out quickly that many people don't like having relatively new players on their team, and those that do are few and far between.  I got the idea for an adopt-a-noob type feature, a mechanic where a new player has a choice to go into a game with a volunteer veteran of the game and the vet could help the noob get better.  Team Fortress 2 has this type of feature but there is really no incentive for players to do it.  In TF2 the reward for helping a certain amount of players could be a new hat or something else cosmetic, or in WoW you could get a special tabard or shirt, or in Dota gain access to some cosmetics and maybe a new HUD or something like that.  Regardless of what players get out of it, it would help the community of the game grow and generally get better.  What's your opinion on adopt-a-noob type features?

If used correctly, it can greatly enhance the gameplay.

 For example, Team Fortress 2 uses movement to differentiate the classes. The soldier can rocket jump at the expense of health. The scout can double jump. Every class has a different movement speed. 



Battlefield 3 uses movement as well, but in a different way. When you're in a tank, you go faster than walking. A jet goes much faster. A helicopter is a very interesting beast to fly. It's very fun to fly, actually.

But why? Why is it fun to fly a helicopter? Why is it fun to rocket jump?

Portal (1 and 2) are games based purely around movement. Some puzzles more than others are a movement exercise with puzzles thrown on top. Others are more puzzling with a movement component. But no matter what, the vast majority of them revolve around moving the player around. 

It's fun to fly through the air in Battlefield and in Portal. Different ways of moving are really fun.

I found a thread about this from about a month ago, asking which games had 'really good movement'. I'm not going to ask for that. I'm going to ask if there is a type of movement **you** can think of that isn't even in a game yet. What would be fun? **What makes movement fun?** Is it the 'flying through the air' part? Is it the 'getting to the destination' part?

Addendum: What about jumping puzzles? I am a huge sucker for the infamous ones in Half Life 1 and 2. I love 'em, most people hate 'em. Why do some people love them? Why do some people hate them?

i'm pretty sure bethesda publishes their own stuff.  so why does bioware, for example,  sign up with ea and essentially give ea their profit?  there's virtually no risk of failure in publishing a bioware game, as bioware games will always sell well, and surely they've made enough money over the years to be able to finance their own games.

The conscious decision to force players into storybook hero archetypes - no anti-heroes, no villains, no average joe, no reluctant hero forced into conflict...no player determined character at all.

After reading a [very well written review](http://www.gog.com/en/gamecard/the_temple_of_elemental_evil) I decided ToEE would be the first game I dove into.

First though, as is my first step in all classic games, I'd go see what mods were out. What I found was a [community](http://www.co8.org) that is still maintaining and adding to the game, after all these years. It seems like they've doubled the length of the game, including new quests all the way up through the first ten levels even. 

And beneath all this, is a game that rivals what I thought was possible before I played FO3. I guess I am young, but finding an open game world where I could do anything, and kill anyone, and people would stay dead was amazing. I loved FO3. Then came along DA:O. Not quite as open, but a game world I loved and gameplay I found satisfying.

ToEE takes (I use the term loosely, since it was obviously before both games) my favorite elements of either area and smashes them together into what I have found so far to be an amazing experience. I haven't even gotten to level 6. When I play open world games that I enjoy greatly due to the mechanical depth I tend to restart them over and over to try new things before I finally finish it. The trend continues in this game and I am about to start a new game, even.

It has a very steep learning curve if you're unfamiliar with D&amp;D 3.5 (I was), but is very rewarding if you are interested in a game with very robust mechanics.

Ultimately, this seems like it's going to lead me on a journey of discovery that is going to eat many hours. I picked up Arcanum, the NWN's, and Torment. I am frankly surprised and find it refreshing that such a dated title can be so fun, after reading about people having trouble getting into the original Deus Ex (I also had the same issues).

Now for the DAE part, anyone else relatively young, or who missed this seemingly golden age of gaming rediscovering the joy of cheap, deep games?

TV shows use a couple of different business models: you can watch on television, for free, but with commercials. Or you can buy a DVD set, for a substantial price, without commercials. Both models work, which is why every show ever uses both. It's not mutually exclusive. 

The cost of a new game is in the same ballpark range as the cost of a recent box set of a season of a TV show, and they provide the same ballpark range of hours of entertainment. A game is a similar commodity to a TV show. 

So why is it that, in addition to selling games ad-free, developers don't also release the same games for free (or at least for a drastically lowered price) in exchange for including commericals? 

Sound silly? Consider: a commercial has to *interrupt* a TV show, but we put up with them anyway. Games, on the other hand, actually have periodic pauses actually *built into the fucking medium.* Loading screens. I'm not doing anything while I'm waiting for a game to load. In fact, that's probably when I'm most susceptible to advertising, since I wouldn't be doing anything even if I wasn't being advertised to. 

So Deus Ex put in little banner ads without lowering the cost of the game. That was probably a shitty thing to do. But I'd be all for it if that business practice knocked a few bucks off of the price tag.

Imagine a FPS campaign where you start off invading a country Normandy style, but then after the mission is successful, you don't fast forward to some future mission, but instead stay in the present time and have to make your way to the next mission on your own. I imagined the gameplay being split up into various batallions you could join. So there could be a default batallion you're assigned to after the successful Normandy invasion, and that batallion's mission could be to drive to some nearby town to take over. Or, you could just drive wherever you wanted, and whatever batallion is closest to you would have to adopt you for their mission. Or, if you drive far enough away, you could be considered a deserter, and your home army would begin sending small groups of troops to try to kill you. Being a deserter, you could then go lone wolf style and just kill everyone in sight, or you could join the enemy's army and begin doing their missions.

The way the missions work would be minor town based battles for each batallion that eventually lead up to over-arching major battles. Since the world is persistent, if you decide to desert your batallion or just generally dick around, then the major battles would continue without you, and if you decide to rejoin a batallion, the main mission could be something completely different from what it was before. For example, in your default batallion after Normandy, you could have a minor mission of securing some town, with the main mission being to penetrate the front line and take over an important base. If you dick around long enough, then you will eventually hear through some radio transmission that the major goal of securing the enemy base was successful, and now a new major mission is set up.

To increase the replayability factor, I was thinking the armies could be fictitious to allow for either side to win, and that the player would be given control of all the batallions in his/her army. So there would be a strategy component to it where the player would control the fate of the army based on how each batallion attacks enemy positions. Additionally, the placement of important bases and enemy positions could be randomized with each new campaign.

What do you guys think? This game could also be categorized as a sandbox FPS game, I guess, based on the randomness of the world and your total freedom of going about through it.",,False,,t5_2sgq6,False,,,True,t3_11t25t,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/11t25t/persistent_world_fps_campaign/,

It's a strange delimiter in how we play games, where we move from adventuring to gaming. 

MMOs seem to be the most frequent occurrence for me, where I'd begin playing with no idea of the scale of the World, or no idea about what the other classes or areas are like. The sense of finding your capital city for the first time, and walking through the gates as epic music begins to play. Or warping into your first mission area in Eve, where NPC pirates have begun staging their assault into secure space. Not caring about doing things properly, but doing them the way you think you would do it.

Then at a certain point all that goes away. There's no longer awe when you arrive in your capital city, or you're watching netflix in another window while entering a mission in eve. Theorycrafting to get that extra 5 dps out of a build that people have been perfecting for years. You start gaming instead of adventuring...

I can't remember what the events were that tipped me over from one to the other, and in some cases I would have avoided them if I knew they were coming. I fail to see how a series of small events could have changed how I experience a game so drastically, yet it has done just that. Fitting a 'howitzer' to my Caldari destroyer in Eve is no longer exciting, but would instead make me tear apart my insides in disgust at how stupid someone would be to do that. I still learn more about the game every day, but the perspective and how I ingest and use that information is completely different than when I first started.

What is with games now-a-days being constantly set in bleak desolate places where the player saves the world? It may just be a coincidence and make for a good story or is there something more? I started thinking about 'this generation' ( late 80’s and early 90’s kids). Is this fascination with destroyed and ruined worlds a Freudian slip or perhaps a hidden thought of what ‘this generation’ thinks and how it feels about the world and their future? Do we make and play games where we save the world because we really do want to save our real world: climate change, war, corruption, financial recessions, etc. Or perhaps we play these games because we feel that we cannot cause such change in our own failing world?

Maybe it is more than just a gamer thing; it may be a culture thing of America or its youth? I remember seeing a picture on reddit a while back like so: On the left was a mid 20th century prediction of the future. Everything was grand, shiny, and Utopian. On the right was a 21st century prediction of the future where everything was a dark, depressing, ruined futuristic slum.

Am I crazy or is there something here? Does ‘this generation’ have something to say or thoughts on/ about the near future through the games we make and play?

GDC is too far away from the end of the year to really have an overall impact. I assume many people take GOTY to mean the overall pick from websites like IGN and Gamespot but without an official GOTY winner then these are just as good as anyone else's personal pick for GOTY and come with no more credibility than IGN or Gamespot do themselves. 

Admittedly GOTY is subjective anyway but without an official GOTY title that all adhere to, like the Oscars, what exactly are we discussing? Its all well to leave a comment saying, ""who cares?

Many of them seem to be missing, or simply skip the 1st act of the Hero's journey. There is little or no setup of the character arc, and thus all character development seeing throughout the game feels shallow and lackluster because it lacks the necessary context.

For example:

* In Far Cry 3 we barely see or experience Jason Brody being weak and helpless. Instead we're an action hero 10 minutes into the game. This cheapens the entire experience as there's no real character arc. It's similar with his friends, who we're supposed to care about saving despite barely having glimpsed them beforehand.

* In Tomb Raider, we never see or hear much of the weak and insecure Lara. The whole wimp to ass-kicker arc is told within the first 20 minutes and thus the remaining arc feels hollow. And again we're supposed to care about friends that are never established properly. It's like watching a High School film where we never see the Nerd/Slacker being rejected by girls or laughed at during class. It undermines the entire following arc.

* Even Sleeping Dogs made a similar mistake in that the player already started undercover. We did not see how the undercover experience changed the protagonist and how he got increasingly entangled by the Yakuza life. Again the entire First Act of the Hero's Journey seems to be missing.

Kickstarter has rejuvenated a number of developers and older franchises. Masterpieces such as Fallout are now being given away for free (temporarily). And of course there are certain ""mainstream"" games like Skyrim or the Mass Effect that have offered cinematic, epic, engrossing, unforgettable experiences.

The future of gaming really does belong to the consumers. The big companies make groundbreaking games here and there, but other big-name titles like Call of Duty just scream monotony, laziness, and cash grabbing. On the whole it's been our support of smaller developers that has really helped push out innovative, original, quality products.

I'm amazed at games like Legend of Grimrock being offered for only $12 while providing a thorough gaming experience. 

I miss the old era, having grown up in the 80s and 90s, but it's clear the real spirit of the gaming community has endured and is now stronger than ever as the power of development passes from the big-name studios and suits to the independent developers and the people.

Game on.

**edit** - some minor controversy in the comments below. Someone asked how CoD is a cash grab. My reasoning is that each subsequent game is largely derivative of its predecessor with little major innovation. There's nothing wrong with giving people a product that is comfortable and familiar, as not everything needs to break new ground, but I currently find the smaller studio and independent games to be much more interesting and memorable in terms of gameplay. I really wanted this to be a discussion about what we love about the current state of gaming, not an argument about Call of Duty.

*edit 2** - still getting comments about why it's not okay for CoD to not be innovative, why it's a cash grab, etc. I'm genuinely puzzled by the argument that CoD is somehow NOT very much like the predecessors. That doesn't make it a terrible or unenjoyable game. It just makes it one into which not much original design went. Take a formula that works, rehash it, put out a new product. There's nothing evil about it, but in my opinion it's a cash grab - something that plays it safe because the developers know people will buy the game. That's not to say lots of effort didn't go into the game. Some of you are really taking offense at specific comments that aren't there.

**edit 3** - never underestimate Call of Duty fans 

**edit 4** - it's funny that someone in the comments said I leapt on someone for asking me why CoD is a cash grab, yet the majority of the comments are people overreacting, jumping on me, and DEMANDING I prove that CoD is a cash grab and that it is no longer innovative. A few people have provided rational insight into why they feel CoD is not a cash grab, but most are lashing out defensively. If your minds have formed opinions based on your gaming tastes which I respect, it's not worth the effort to show you my viewpoint. Here's an example from the comments:

*""It seems that everyone is very unappreciative and in a matter spoiled. They expect everything to appeal to their needs only. But do not look at that this game appeals to many others needs and theirs is not important. And people like you do not like that.""*

That seems personal, suggesting that I am spoiled and unappreciative. Now really, who's being insulting? All this anger because I claimed that Call of Duty has become a lazy franchise that doesn't need to innovate because the legions of followers on display in this comments section will put down $60 every 12 months for a new version? Again, I'm not questioning whether you find value in the game or not. If you get hundreds of hours of enjoyable gameplay, more power to you. My point is about the lacking incentive for them to take risks. Most developers who take risks end up doing so independently because the main publishers don't find their concepts profitable compared to the tried and true Call of Duty. Same trend applies to movies. 

I'll use the Michael Bay analogy again - his movies make a ton of money and take a hell of a lot of man hours to create. Are they quality movies? That's up to you. There's entertainment value, but many people find them to lack quality. That's how some people feel about mainstream games like the various CoD sequels.

1329202794.0,115,self.truegaming,pot07,"In response to the top post right now, let's talk about a game that DOES get storytelling right: Phoenix Wright.",,173,58,77,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/pot07/in_response_to_the_top_post_right_now_lets_talk/,"There is so much to be said about Phoenix Wright. Beyond its campy, humorous exterior lies a truly moving and tension-filled plot with interesting characters and incredible theming. I want to discuss a few things that this game does right, and then get a little more in-depth about my own interpretation of some of the plot elements, such as the weird, metaphysical mysticism going on.

First of all, this is a character-based story. Without a stake in the characters, the plot would fall flat and we wouldn't give enough of a shit to press on through the investigations and trials. So as such, let's talk about the characterization and what this game does right.

There are so many things right off the bat which define Phoenix's character. The fact that he stutters and seems very nervous while Mia points out that it's very unusual that a lawyer's first case is a *murder trial* give us an idea of who Phoenix is as a person. Then comes a self-monologue wherein he delivers the background of the case and he states with certainty that Butz couldn't have done it. Why? 

&gt;But I know better than anyone, that he's a good guy at heart.

That's it. That's all Phoenix is going on: a gut feeling. One of the major thematic elements of the game is Phoenix's intuition triumphing over overwhelming odds. Within the first few seconds of the game, Phoenix has established a character: he is a bumbling novice (through his stuttering), yet a righteous man (who takes a murder trial to defend the name of his best friend) who relies on his keen intuition (because he knows that he's a ""good guy at heart."")

Of course, we're also introduced to Mia and Butz. Mia is the archetypal mentor while Butz provides comic relief in his own, unique way. The stark contrast helps expand Phoenix's character even more: when compared to Mia, Phoenix seems like an utterly confused and helpless rookie, but then Butz comes in and delivers his lines of dialogue:

&gt;Dude, I'm so guilty!! Tell them I'm guilty!!! [...] Oh, it's all over... I... I'm finished. Finished!

This puts Phoenix's character into perspective and also provides contrast to the seemingly stoic attitude of Mia. Phoenix may be nervous and helpless compared to Mia, but he is nowhere near as bad as the Butz. 

Then, we learn with Phoenix about how trials proceed and we're introduced to the gameplay elements which seamlessly flow with the plot. An important character to note is the Judge, who is the grandfatherly figure of the courtroom. Even his character design is chosen to look like somebody's grandfather, with his bald head and long beard. 

Then, Edgeworth. There is just so much to discuss about the Wright-Edgeworth contrast and so many things it does right to strengthen the characters.

Think about everything we know about Phoenix at the point you meet Edgeworth. Edgeworth is the *exact* opposite of that. He is the perfect foil character across the courtroom for Phoenix. Edgeworth is prim, proper, and a perfectionist with questionable morals who values the verdict over justice. To top it all off, Edgeworth is *logical* and *rational*. For the next two cases against Edgeworth, Phoenix *only* triumphs over Edgeworth's cold, hard, brutal, calculating style because of a sudden revelation, either brought on by his own intuition or something mystical. Edgeworth does not hesitate to show his disdain for everything illogical and intangible while this is what *Phoenix fucking relies on* almost every case. This is what's called ""theming."" And it's so perfectly executed. 

But here's the strange thing: we are led to despise Edgeworth because he represents everything Phoenix is not, but Phoenix consistently reminds us that he ""knows the true Edgeworth."" This creates some incredible dramatic tension: who is Edgeworth really and how does Phoenix know him? What could've caused such a shift in character? Will Edgeworth ever once again become the man that Phoenix knows him to be? The player must wait until 1-4 to find out. (People argue that 1-3 is a filler for this reason, but there's important character development going on in the trial between Phoenix and Edgeworth which sets up for the intense final chapter.)

To put it simply, every single character in this game has a purpose in order to drive the character development of Phoenix and Edgeworth so that Edgeworth's struggle and final redemption in the end is so, so sweet.

Onto thematic structure... I'm going to just put this out there: to me, the mysticism in the game is a metaphor for the intangible aspect of what it means to be a human and serves as an antithesis to the Holmesian omnipotence of logic and reason. I concede that this is probably looking into it too much, but this is how I felt about the game and what makes it even greater. von Karma and Edgeworth's adherence to logic and reason fails in comparison to Phoenix's sudden revelations when all hope seems lost. His ""gut feelings"" trump logic. I'd say that this is the top theme of the game and helps tell a great story. 

The next top theme is obviously the story of character redemption. For a man who values competence as a high virtue, Edgeworth possibly *killed his own father due to his own incompetence*. This devastated him and this one fault haunted his character for a long time, and his story of how one can still be redeemed even after all of these years is truly inspiring.

It's getting really late now though and I'll expand on these ideas in the morning, but I'd like to hear what you guys have to say. What do you think?

For anyone that hasn't played the game let me describe it to you. First off let me say I'm on PC. There is quick item slots which can only be access with holding down the middle mouse button and rolling the mouse around trying to select one, you don't know what the item is other then a generic icon until you roll over it making it hard to figure out what is what in the middle of a fight, its best just to open the inventory and equip something. 

Now the whole game is about having a 5+ weapons with you at all times to choose from great every one enjoys a good selection right? Well this game makes you hate having more than one weapon. Lets say you have your favorite base ball bat in your hands and you see a nice knife you want to use later on as a thrown weapon, you pick it up and now its in your hands well I didn't want to equip it I just wanted it in my back pack, well I'll just use my quick inventory to go back and equip my baseball bat, nope the knife replaced it. Now I need to open my inventory select the baseball bat, hit equip, select the slot I want and now I can go back to the game. Doesn't sound like much but when you do this 4-5 times every 10-15 minutes it gets very annoying very fast.

Throwing this game has it, enemy getting to close throw your weapon at them! great skill to have and is awesome to use with a bunch of knives, too bad its so broken. First you have to have all your throwing weapons in your quick inventory so lets say I have 5 knives I use as throwing weapons all in quick slots. Switch from my baseball bat to a knife throw it and now the game random selects my next weapon that goes into my hands, so now I'm holding a grenade, switch to my next knife and throw it, now I'm holding a medkit. Gets annoy very fast when you have 5-6 zombies coming at you. 

Collecting my throwing weapons cannot be any more frustrating. Basically combine the issues of finding weapons with setting your inventory into one cluster fuck. Every time you pick one of your weapons up it replaces your current weapon, and you have to go into your inventory and put every single one of them back into quick slots.

The opinions expressed certainly *sound* reasonable, but I was hoping that Redditors with experience of both cultures (or any combination of both ""Western"" and ""Eastern"" cultures) could express either how true it is or explain why it's an oversimplification. Modern Japan is not the land of samurais and ninjas like it once was in its past, and the country certainly has used guns in conflict, so I wonder why guns would be so differently portrayed and opined about in many Japanese developed games.

First thing, I think, would need to be limited communication. While people can always hop on vent, for those interested in having an enjoyable horror experience, they'd use in-game chat. I think a whisper/talk sort of concept would work well, where you can whisper things to your ally when you're close and enemies would not detect the 'sound'. However, if you want to communicate when you and your friend's characters are further away, you'd need to 'talk' at a normal volume, which could alert the enemy to your presence.

Then, of course, there should be mind games. The game should display your partner doing things that he isn't actually doing, to mess with your perception of each other. Trust should not be naturally implied; the game should encourage you to want to take advantage of your partner, rather than work along with each other.

Miasmata, Shadow of the Colossus, Amnesia and Dear Esther are some of the prime examples that I can think of. 

It's not just about exploration, it's about that nebulous sense of wonder and grandeur (tainted as it may be in Amnesia). Does anyone know where this style of game making started?  I feel like this is a new trend in gaming, maybe I'm just too young but the earliest occurrence of something like it that I remember would be the first time I spun up ICO. It seems to me that its a natural product of gaming's move towards being recognized as an art form; as it's players and it's creators grow and their hobby enters the mainstream it becomes more important to explore what the medium can convey in terms of experience. Instead of goals and stories as a motivating factor, these games are designed around invoking a natural emotional response from a very subtle narrative. They also often limit the actions the player can take and minimize or remove combat entirely, I suspect so that the player can be more gently guided without risk of getting stuck and confused on minor points of ambiguity. 

Sooo... that wasn't really a question, or even a good conversation starter (Hi r/truegaming! This is my first post here!), but I'd really love to know if anyone else has any thoughts on this new paradigm in gaming, or have any favourites of the genre (and why!).

Look at baseball. You start playing in pee wee leagues. You won't even have a pitcher, it will just be T-Ball. You go to little leagues, now you have a pitcher, but the bases are still very close together and the fence is not far. And then you get to the pros, which has the most difficult field layout, and most restrictive rules.

Games that call themselves E-Sports though? They don't do this. Gameplay is balanced first and foremost for extreme level play. If a weapon or tactic is OP in the hands of a pro, its nerfed, even if people of lesser skill cannot make use of it, or can only modestly make it perform.

Every single real sport has multiple sets of rules based on the skill and knowledge of those playing at each level. Save E-Sports, where everyone plays the same rules and restrictions as the pros, regardless of whether that works well or not.


Specific examples of this from Tribes Ascend.

-Expert flag cappers can routinely and reliably hit the flag at 250+, and pub chasers are completely incapable of matching this.

-Expert snipers can shut down a match. But expert snipers are very few and far between, and the sniper class for the ordinary scrub is completely worthless.

Tribes Ascend is very much a game designed for skilled vets being played by unskilled players. There is no 'T-ball' style play.. You just get stuck on the same field with the same bats the pros have to use.

With all the rumors &amp; speculation going on recently concerning the next generation of gaming consoles, I figured I would list some of what I hope are realistic expectations for the new Nintendo machine.

1. A de-emphasis on motion controls. This seems likely due to the fact that the primary controller is the tablet. I can't imagine having to waggle that beast in place of a button press. My hope is that motion controls were a good way to widen the market overall but ultimately a feint to get Microsoft &amp; Sony to spend resources trying to provide a similar input method. I read a comment somewhere the other day that summed up my feelings perfectly: This generations 1st party Nintendo games were great despite their motion controls rather than because of them. I think it would also be a good idea to offer some of this generation's great Nintendo games via digital download and/or at retail with the controls tweaked to remove the waggle. My prime candidates for this overhaul would include both Galaxy games, both Zelda games, &amp; Donkey Kong Country Returns, a game I wanted to love but didn't mainly due to waggle replacing a button press. Buttons as the primary input was never broken, I'm not sure why they tried to fix it.

2. Keep It Simple, Stupid. This goes right along with #1. To me the tablet would be a great success if it's main purpose was to de-clutter the TV screen by moving inventories, maps, &amp; radar to the smaller screen. The other function that sounds like a winner is to use the tablet as your own personal gaming screen so as not to hog the TV. I think Nintendo has realized that while people certainly take their handhelds on the go with them, a significant portion play them some or most of the time while sitting at home. For example, I could have an NFL game going on the big screen while being able to quickly hop back into my paused Wii-U game during commercials or halftime without having to change inputs on the TV.

3. Two tablet functionality. Speaking of the NFL, they should try to make this a reality for the Madden factor alone. Imagine a clutter-free Madden game on the big screen showing instant replays between plays while the play-calling takes place on the tablets. I feel like this would be a system-selling attribute, to have the edition of Madden 13/14 that is the consensus best version available. This is the best reason I can think of for this functionality but there are certainly others. It would be awesome if 2 or more people could play Mario Kart using the same machine while having their own screen. 

4. Minimize load-times &amp; system noise. Nintendo has always been a leader in these fields. I realize people want Wii-U to be powerful. I do too. However, I'll be fine with a machine that is similar in capability to the PS3 with faster load-times &amp; less system noise. Life's too short for loading screens &amp; even though I like my PS3 just fine my main complaint, besides load-times, is the high-pitched white noise produced pretty much whenever it is turned on. I know this stuff is nitpicking but it is one of the advantages of using less than cutting edge technology. 

5. Less story, more gameplay. I feel like this is Nintendo's philosophy as it stands anyway, but even they could do a better job of making stuff you want to skip over even more skippable. One of the great things about most Nintendo systems is the time it takes from turning the power on to actually playing the game is relatively short. They've moved away from this a little bit over the years with even the Mario games having stuff you are forced to sit through at the beginning of the game. My wish is to be able to skip any type of cut-scene or text box asap. I know there is a whole lot of people who play games for the story. I am not one of these people. If I want a story, I read a book or watch a movie. The stories of gaming come out of the circumstances of playing the game. Bottom line, I want to be playing as opposed to watching or reading. 

6. Misc. Release date of 11/11/12 or 11/18/12. MSRP of $299 or less. Major retail games @ $60, downloadable games &amp; apps from $1-$30. USB 2.0 compatible flash drives as system HDD. 

7. Online presence. I think everyone expects a much greater emphasis on  a service similar to Sony &amp; Microsoft. However, I would be surprised if Nintendo allows the Wii-U to become the households pejorative delivery system. Therefore I would be surprised to see traditional voice chat a la Xbox Live supported. Lastly, I think it will be free as opposed to a subscription service, for 1st party titles at least.

8. Lastly, please keep in mind this is from the point of view of a longtime Nintendo fan &amp; not a hardcore gamer. I've owned all the current consoles at some point but the one that gets the most use at the moment is my PS3 functioning as a blu-ray player and occasional game machine. As an only child whose parents divorced in 1986, the NES was a great distraction for me in the late '80s and for a variety of reasons I've been a Nintendo fan ever since. I was disappointed in the Wii overall mostly due to the focus on motion controls, but I'm hopeful about Wii-U.

TL;DR De-emphasize motion controls, support multiple tablets for Madden if no other reason, keep load times &amp; machine noise to a minimum, &amp; make it easy for me to be gaming quickly. Also, I'm a Nintendo fanboy.

In almost every RPG I've played, there's a massive element of stepping outside the game to fiddle with some control or another, or do math, or pick skills, etc. Whenever I see these games discussed online, many discussions devolve into the mechanics and stats more than the gameplay or story.

For example, from what I've seen of J-RPGs is that they are extremely focused on numbers and stats, tweaking the character/party for maximum performance and efficiency. Western RPGs less so, but there's still an awful lot of skill-picking, leveling up, etc. I'm curious to know if it's possible to design a good RPG *without* these elements. In a game such as Oblivion, it's always been immersion-breaking and annoying for me to need to open up a window and check if I've finally balanced my thieving skill with my dexterity score, or to see ""Leveled up Swordfighting!"" after a battle and immediately be able to kill the same monster in one hit instead of two.

I'm envisioning a situation where the game itself would track a massive amount of data such as skill sets, attributes, statuses, situations, behavior, etc, but all of this data and the interplay behind it would be invisible to the player. I'd never want to do any meta-character building outside of the initial creation process, everything would (hopefully) be a natural progression.

This begs the question of how to illustrate this progression to the player in an equally natural way; If I don't select ""Advanced Lockpicking II"" from a skill menu, how will I know I'm any better at it? Am I going to have to break a lockpick to find out? If there's no metric for an abstract score like Dexterity for me to see, will I need to drop objects randomly while holding them in-hand?

Let me start off by saying that I've been a reader here for quite some time. Not as long as some in comparison, I'm sure, but it's been a while regardless.

As the title of the post clearly implies, I think the possibilities for a TrueGaming magazine could be extremely fun and an exciting project to get involved with. 

I was inspired by the recent Starcraft 2 inspired e-sports magazine ""GLHF"" by the professional look they gave their magazine and overall style in which they presented their work. Also, for my A Level in Media, I had to create a magazine which I also thought was really fun.

So, with that short introduction out of the way, I'd like a discussion as to what you think the magazine should have, who would be interested in helping out and any other related topics.

Theoretically, if this were something we were interested in the possible team positions I could think of would be as follows:

* Writing Team
* Design Team 
* Editors   
* Technical Help
 
I personally would like to take the magazine down the route of a more think-piece article with a mix of general gaming news which tends to be what the majority of successful posts here are focused around.

This would have to be non-profit, obviously, as there is no way to gain guaranteed income unless it got very popular. However, I'm sure the experience of being in a team that creates magazines would look pretty good on a CV for someone who wanted to join the media industry.

I think that if people were to post their opinions on what you think the magazine should be here,  it could be compiled into a makeshift concept document we could all work from.

The magazine itself could be bi-monthly, although a push for monthly with a larger team is very viable option provided that the team is big enough to support that type of pressure.

The team itself should keep in contact with each other too so as there is not a reason for mistakes in the final product.

As I've said before, this has the potential to be a great learning experience and opportunity for everyone involved. Obviously, if you think this isn't a very good idea I'd like to know why and for you to express your concerns in an orderly manner.

I think requirements for the team should be:

**Writing Team:**

* Coherent and fluid use of English
* Reliable and can keep to deadlines
* Able to think of engaging material
* Decent spelling (no need for immaculate spelling as it can be cleaned up by editors, but their job is hard enough as it is, so try not to give them more work)
* Enthusiasm and knowledge of industry

**Design Team:**

* Experience with design work is preferred 
* Can utililise an editing/publishing software to create good looking articles
* Orderly and effective approach 
* Can meet deadlines and work well under pressure
* Enthusiasm and knowledge of industry

**Editors:**

* Keen eye for picking up mistakes
* Good communication skills
* Meet deadlines
* Work with initiative


I think that just about rounds it up - I'm confident that we could make this happen even if it's only for one issue and let's not get ahead of ourselves but this has the ***possibility*** to give us a little extra something in the pocket at the end of the month. I can't stress how that it only a possibility and how it can only be achieved through hard work and determination to do the best we can.

(A bit late to the party, but I guess I needed time to think.)",KeyboardChemistry,186,74,101,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/k5sd5/why_steam_is_in_the_wrong_not_ea_a_bit_late_to/,"Originally disccused here, updated and expanded for true-gaming. (http://www.reddit.com/r/gamernews/comments/k5ha4/blizzard_and_valve_want_consoles_to_unite_online/c2hpicn)

I'm referring to the controversy over several EA games being pulled from Steam because they would not offer DLC through Steam, but only through their own proprietary system. 

If you look at how DLC tends to work for PC games, and why, I think it actually becomes a rather unfair demand for Valve to make.

Let's look at how Team Fortress 2 works. You open up TF2. While in TF2 you access a store and buy stuff. Awesome. Convenient. You don't have to do ANYTHING outside of the game. (Steam, for this purpose, is basically just a login account with your credit card info saved).

Most games want to have a system pretty much like that. It's awesome and convenient. Hence why TF2 does it. However, most games aren't available exclusively through steam. So they can't just have a cute little system that uses your Steam account-- they have to have their own system set up to do pretty much the same thing.

So developers of other games use some other account that is universal for all players who own the game, regardless of platform. Basically, one more thing you sign up for and enter you credit card information into. 

Not as easy as Steam having it already, but not the end of the world. And it allows the developer to keep all accounts, regardless of where they bought the game, getting the exact same experience.

Steam is basically asking games to program their DLC to work in two ways rather than one. They can use the above system I described for all of their non-steam consumers-- and they can program something to work like the Call of Duty games for steam users. Where you navigate to a store page and buy the DLC.

What happens when you buy the DLC through steam is essentially you getting a CD key, which you then enter into the proprietary DLC system the developer already has in place. So for no real reason, that company just gave some of the profit to steam. Especially since, for the sake of simplicity, the actual content hosting and download of the DLC will usually be through the game's proprietary system, rather than through steam.

In the end, the whole thing reeks of putting pressure on developers to just go 100% Steamworks. This way, they only have to develop one system in the first place, for all their users-- Valve's system. As as individual, I'm actually in favor of this, because I love Steam and the convenience of Steamworks, achievements, etc. I view a game coming with Steamworks as a +10% on review scores when I consider buying it, for all intents and purposes.

But trying to be a bit more longsighted than that, I think its important that the developers maintain as much control as possible over their games. Letting Steam arbitrarily decide that game developers can't do something within their own game is far more power than I want to give any company.

With DLC, the game developers have all the power. They can tell you about it inside the game, meaning they don't have to spend tons of money marketing it. And they can sell it to you right in the game-- meaning they don't have to give anyone else a cut of the profit. But Steam right now is trying to change that.

The level designs fit the gameplay so well and even morph mid-race. When you win a race it's because of pure skill.

Splinter Cell: Conviction, Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit, Civilization V, SSX. All of these games and more have been mentioned in comments, articles, and the like in association with the 'dumbing-down,' or simplification of games.


I have long considered and am sort of still figuring out which side I am on when it comes to this. Simplifying is a good thing. A lot in life should be more simple, yet sometimes when this ideology is taken to games it doesn't seem to hold true. Yet, other times it makes for a great game. I thought Conviction, while definitely more a 'shoot-the-enemy' then full-stealth game, was a shit-load of fun. However, Civ V seemed to get rid of too much and is now a lesser game because of it.


I think, with most art, you have to take it on an individual basis, but what's reddit's opinion? Is it all an individual thing? Or is this trend occurring because the publishers want maximum effect with their games to make maximum profit? (This doesn't exactly make sense, as the kids today who play games seem to be twice, or even three times proficient at figuring out stuff as I was as a kid...) But, are we the dumb ones for dreaming of a more challenging time? Especially when we have achievements to challenge us. And the possibility that it wasn't as fun as we remember (glorifying, nostalgia, etcetera).

Prime examples would be games like Mass Effect or Deus Ex: Human Revolution. People seem to expect there to be massive consequences to every decision.

I find these expectations unrealistic from people that don't actually understand what happens in game design. People use the label ""scriped event"" in games as a bad thing, when often, every major event must be scripted in a game, or there would not be correct assets to fit the event (talking games with stories, voice acting here). So essentially, people that expect more than one or two similar endings are expecting the developers to lay out an unending series of scripted events that occur based on what the player did.

Is there something I'm missing here? Are your expectations actually warranted? Or am I correct in assuming that people who hate on games for having a ""false sense of choice"" have far too high of expectations?

I'd also be interested in games that had fully developed stories that had a true sense of choice that didn't result in a few ""scripted"" endings. Clearly, I hold a bias, but I truly do wish to hear the reasoning behind the counter-view, because I generally only see it in small quips with no real process behind it.

EDIT: For clarification, I'm talking about story based games. This has nothing to do with choices in gameplay. This has everything to do with people who expect a game to have many different endings depending on choices they made within a game (Mass Effect's Paragon/Renegade system).

Seriously guys, this has to stop.  Open-ended questions do not, as a rule, lead to interesting discussion; what they do is open the floor for mass statement of opinions without justification or explanation.  As I've said elsewhere, if we are simply going to be listing our opinions or experiences, we might as well save the bandwidth and go and vote on pictures in r/gaming; it achieves the same goal.

The thing is, this is supposed to be about thought-provoking discussion, and a way to provoke thought is to use your words to frame a point of possible contention.  

As a (made-up) negative example, *""What does truegaming think about on-rails sections of shooters?""* is an open ended question.  This  is then usually followed by ""I think they are good and I liked it in game {x}"".  This doesn't generate discussion, this just gives people license to answer with short sentences, like ""I like them because they are fun"" or ""I don't like them because they take control away and that is dumb!""

How about *""Hey truegaming, I've noticed that classic on-rails segments seem to be disappearing, although FPS gameplay itself seems to be becoming more and more linear.  They haven't quite merged though, and here's why.""* as a positive example.

I'm a lefty. I already had trouble in certain sports, and then Nintendo had to bring those same troubles into my gaming hobby. 

A couple examples: 

The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess (Wii). This game actually didn't give me much trouble. I held the Wii Remote in my left hand, regardless of the fact that Link became right-handed in this game. This made the controls slightly awkward (Link would slash randomly, thinking the controller was moving towards the left), but overall I was OK. Nintendo did not have an option for left-handed individuals.

Super Mario Galaxy 1/2. I was stumped here. Do I hold the Wii Remote in order to aim with my dominant hand, or do I hold the remote in my right hand in order to have more comfortable controls for the nunchuck?

The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword. This was the worst. It basically comes down to two options:

1. Hold the wii remote with my dominant hand, but the 1:1 motion causes link to be confused about where to carry the sword. The wii remote is slightly to the left of where it would be if a right-handed person was wielding it, so link constantly leans to the left/swings to the left when I try to do anything with the sword.

2. Hold the wii remote like a right-handed person, causing me to feel awkward holding it and using all the buttons, and I can't aim/slash worth a damn because I'm left handed. 

Once again there are no left-handed options to be found. The DS/3DS is just as awkward in some cases, but at least in the games I've played there are multiple control options. This is a problem for me, and no doubt a problem for many other Nintendo fans who are also leftys.

Generally story driven games draw a lot of the motivation to play them from the cliffhangers, unresolved mysteries and similiar elements. At the same time these games tend to be time consuming and at least adult life sometimes requires us to stop playing for a bit. I've tried to wrap my head around what exactly the factors are that make me reconsider picking up where I left off. I've put together a by no means comprehensive list and I'm very interested what your experience with the issue is and what could be done about it. I'm sure some would argue that a game is an experience which depends on every part of it being consciously consumed by the player but playing through another 25h to see the last 15h seems excessive. Even 4-5h to see the ending at 7h could be an issue for people who don't have a lot of time to game so here we are, looking for, in my opinion, a way to make a game more enjoyable from outside the game.

* My first problem was actually the worst yet simplest: button layout. When a game is not 100% true to the standard layout in a genre it tends to be tedious to find one's way back into it. I'm sure we all remember the small number of PSX games where O was considered ""confirmation"" instead of X. Obviously the answer would be to either use the standard layout or make it customizable. At the same time I already found it very helpful to have a way to view the button functions in the game or at least in the manual.

* The second big problem for me was remembering all the skills names, actions, attributes etc. which could be addressed with some sort of on the fly encyclopedia but that's probably not the easiest thing to implement without making it seem like studying a textbook. A ""what the heck does this do again"" button is good but seriously helpful tooltips could be better. Or, you know, just name things in a descriptive way.

* Thirdly my skill had deteriorated when I picked up action oriented games after a while. I could no longer keep up with the mechanics required, didn't know how to use combos and how to dodge enemies (in this case: Castlevania Lords of Shadows). I played for a while and it got better but some sort of training mode would be pretty cool.

* And now for the grand issue that made me spend 30 minutes reading up, the story line. I couldn't for the life of me remember who was angry with whom for whatever reason, why I was where I was and how everybody got there. There are characters I know I've seen before but couldn't put into context. Now I know not every game progresses linearly but shouldn't there be some form of cliffnotes available in a game? I've seen especially western RPGs include a ""diary"" of some sorts but usually these don't capture the story in an easily consumable way. I would like to know who did what to whom, why and when up until that point in the game without going through 100 pages some very dedicated developers typed up for even more dedicated fans. I know that in one the mario games you can let the game walk you through solving the level. Why not include something like this to remember specific pieces of the story whenever you feel puzzled? Stop a cutscene, mark a character and let the game show you what you've been told about him. Basically the guy who played through it a dozen times and sits next to you but inside the game.

What do you guys think are other problems with picking up games after a while and what could be done to solve this?

This made me wonder about the popularity of the sniper class in general. I'll admit I don't play any competitive online FPS like BF3 etc, but from what I gather, snipers tend to be very popular in those games. I appears that people choosing sniper classes or playstyles are a plurality in many games, if not an outright majority.

I played Mordecai in Borderlands (solo) and am really hoping to find a scope soon in STALKER, which I just started. In Bastion I relied on the Scrap Musket (faster than waiting for Carbine to aim), in Mass Effect 1/2 I used carbines or sniper rifles almost exclusively, etc, etc.

I don't know.  I guess I'm rambling at this point. I've been a huge fan of Battlefield, all expansions, and spinoffs.  Maybe I had this high expectation of what the game should've been, but isn't.  Maybe it was because I now have Skyrim coming up on Friday AND I was just invited into the Beta Weekend for SWTOR and I need to find a way to balance all three of these games and my real life.  But I can't help feeling like I went to go see this critically acclaimed awesome movie, but left feeling empty. 

Battlefield, why do I feel let down?  Why can't you be perfect?  You're a stunning game and I'm in awe of the massive battles, but why can't these imperfections be taken care of?

1365811811.0,111,self.truegaming,1c8pcd,Exploration in open-world games: We need more Blackreaches,l3un1t,137,26,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1c8pcd/exploration_in_openworld_games_we_need_more/,"There's a moment in open-world games where the blindfold is taken off. 
It's that moment when you emerge from Vault 113, blinded by the sunlight. It's that moment when you find the ending of a cave and an entrance to ""**Skyrim**"", and endure the longest loading screen within the game. It's...it's... hmm. Well, it's not really something that happens all too often in videogames. 

Don't get me wrong, that ""big reveal"" moment happens all the time; your guide thrusts you forwards from a dinky little shack into a beautiful antechamber, and you're overcome by how stunning the room appears to be. The thing is, I'm not referring to being pushed into another room; I'm talking about being pushed *outdoors*. In both antechambers and ""dinky little shacks"", you can walk with your hand along the walls and find yourself exactly where you were before. Until you open a door to another room, you can keep doing this for a very long time. Outdoors, however... there's so much *more*.

There's so much to see, and find, and conquer. There are so many people to talk to, so many cities to find, so many ruins to explore, so much stuff. So, so much stuff. And the lore! There's a silly amount of lore too, whether it be descriptions of monumental moments in the world's history, the origins of a particular item/enemy, or discovering that flying bananas can't, in fact, talk; they just want you to believe they can. And it's all wonderful, whether you find the lore incredible or dull, whether you find the items useful or useless; it's all *there*, and it's what helps makes the world a *world*, and not just a really huge room. 

That's not to denounce the antechamber, however; the outdoors envies all that the antechamber can easily accomplish. The linear antechamber can focus all of its resources into the story it tells and the quality of the set-pieces within it. These are created from resources that the outdoors places into being so huge  These are characteristics that the outdoors can compensate for with size and exploration and, on the occasion, lore, but struggles to equal in full. The antechamber excels at being toured, whilst the outdoors excels at being explored. 

This is why we need more Blackreaches. Sort of. 

Blackreach, for those of you who are unaware, is [this](http://media.moddb.com/images/groups/1/5/4562/2012-02-19_00018.jpg): a vast, underground, cavern, filled with the ruins of the technologically-advanced Dwemer (elf equivalent to dwarves), an extinct race whose closed-in ruins you've likely discovered throughout the game. Not only do Dwemer ruins inspire mystery and wonder, but they contrast so deeply with the setting of Skyrim itself. The entire game, you find yourself familiar with [fields](http://static.skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/images/9503-1-1329183403.jpg), [forests](http://metavideogame.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/skyrim-fall-forest.jpg), [cities](http://gamethingdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/tesvskyrim.jpeg), and [ruins](http://images.wikia.com/elderscrolls/images/archive/0/0b/20120123142911!Highgate_Ruins_.png), and [dwemer ruins](http://media.moddb.com/images/members/1/339/338028/tes5_skyrim_103.jpg), each with their own charms. Then... *[this](http://media.moddb.com/images/groups/1/5/4562/2012-02-19_00018.jpg)*. This gigantic, mysterious, beautiful cavern is presented to you from the very bottom of a Dwemer ruin, and it stuns. It really does. However, it's *presented* to you, and therein lies the lost oppertunity. 

You are assigned a mission -- *find the elder scroll* -- and *led* by an arrow floating in the sky, ^1 You find yourself on a floating hunk of ice with a door unceremoniously shoved into the walls of the iceberg. Opening this hole, you unexpectedly discover the... interesting... man you seek, hiding at the icy fringes of the world. This old wizard gives you the blocky keys to Blackreach in the hopes you will return with a key for his own device(s), and off you go, to climb to the top of a mountain, only to fight your way to it's depths, where the door to Blackreach lies ""hidden"". 

I found out that this was actually part of a mission some time after I had found the old man.

You see, you can discover him without the mission. Now imagine that. Starting at the ""1"", read through that description again, and imagine as though it's something you've stumbled upon. You can run your hands along the massive, unfathomably huge walls of Skyrim and feel your hands slip over a crack in the most unexpected of places, and in that moment, a flash of surprise overwhelms, and curiosity consumes you.  After some searching, you find the strangely-designed doorknob, one you've never seen before. You pull on it, and you open up a bizarrely beautiful room that you never knew existed. *You* find this room. *You* find Blackreach. This is the sort of Blackreach that should be, paradoxically, in all games. 

This is exploration. This is what the outdoors can accomplish. This is what an antechamber can accomplish when it hides the door with something other than sheer size, and when the ""Blackreach"" itself isn't a mere closet home to a tiny, tasty easter egg on a pedestal.

Much of the wonder of discovery is taken away when an arrow points the way to the man with the keys. That's assuming that there *is* a man with the keys, and not a giant neon sign above an expanse of wall reading, ""Look underneath this sign! There's nothing at all!"". It can be better when the doors are made obvious, but in doing so, they abolish the notion of discovery. Plus, these doors can become *too* hidden. There is no joy in spending hours upon hours hopelessly combing a wall with a microscope when the only reward will be a tasty easter egg. Tasty it may be, but it's hardly the feast earned for the week's worth. 

Unfortunately, it's difficult to effectively hide away a place like Blackreach for the explicit purpose of being stumbled upon, let alone include more than one such place in a game. Once a player figures out that there are hidden doors in the walls, they cease to be hidden, and merely become out of sight. If every game began to include ""hidden wonders"" like Blackreach, they would cease to be either hidden or wonders. 

Yet, despite this paradox, we *need* more Blackreaches. We need more of those ""Aha!"" moments in gaming, but some of them need to be *discovered*, whether they lie in an antechamber *or* ""in"" the outside. Antichamber itself is a *game* of discovered ""Aha!""s that I myself find fantastic, yet it hardly stirred up [the](/spoiler) massive critical acclaim [of Bioshock Infinite](/spoiler)[, a game which suddenly thrusts you into it's own ""Aha!"" moment (fun fact: SPOILER ABOUT THE GAME AHEAD)](/spoiler)[as you drown in the clutches of the multiverse Elizabeths](/spoiler). 

*The omitted text is meant to prevent spoiling games, with multiple spoiler tags to act as buffers for those brave souls that want to know which games I'm referring to.*

Games need to be able to *give* as well as *hide* their ""Aha!"" moments. The latter is far more difficult to craft, and, perhaps, doomed to lose. Not only must gamers *find* the first crumb in the trail; they must actively follow it, which can prove difficult and unrewarding if poorly implemented, *or* if implemented to a crowd used to following the arrows to the ""Aha!"" moments. 

As it stands, these moments of discovery are present within some games ([Fez, Deus Ex; HR, Skyrim, Antichamber](/spoiler)) and my frustration with finding these hidden doors to hidden doors is one massive irony, and might illustrate the very problem with crafting these wonderful sort of moments. 

Anyways, thanks for trucking through this massive post, you brave soul, you. Hopefully it inspires discussion!

I'm not even speaking about stuff that might be somewhat controversial such as the Avatars that were clearly ripped off of the Wii or the fact they put advertisements in the dash now.

No, for the most part I'm talking about how our current iteration would make AOL feel proud of their design.  

I'm sure anyone could make a laundry list of issues, but here's my top 5:

1. Has a touch screen interface, isn't navigated by touchscreen for 90% of it's customers, and I'm pretty sure the few kinect owners aren't exactly thrilled at gesturing around to navigate all the time.  Why?

2. Everything takes time to load, and it's not better than where things were in 2006 either, some things actually worked better then.  Even the the new ads take time to load, and who decided they needed to include video?  Even my newer 360 slim console can't keep up with the intense activity of browsing the game store and loading a couple paragraphs of text.  Considering we've seen games refine and make great use of the hardware, why does the dashboard tax the hardware so much?

3.  Can I find all the Arcade titles I've bought?  No, I have to sift through the entire library of stuff I haven't bought in order to find it.  Steam has a library, how hard is it?

4. Dead simple options like ""show status: offline"" reset every time the box is turned off.  What is the point in allowing me to ""ghost"" my friends if they all instantly know I'm online a second beforehand.   It just makes them know they're being ghosted.   Really, what dick at Microsoft decided on this?

5.  The system music and video players - abysmal and still in the state they were in 2006.  I don't know why I'm listing it as a problem because it was a no-show to begin with.

Maybe I'm just venting but this has been a monkey on my back for years now.

It occurred to me that I don't think that campaign is working towards a solution for the problem.  It's raising awareness, but not providing a solution that anyone can work towards.

I think it's important to start working on that solution, if we want to resolve this.  I stayed gender-neutral in the title because this problem also affects male characters in video games, too, if to a lesser extent.

What I'd like to do is compile a list of Dos and Don'ts when creating video game characters.  Things to avoid, and how to avoid them.  When someone creates a character that violates the guildlines of the list, they should have some help in shaping that character into something better.

I'm not calling for an end to scantily-clad women.  I'm a healthy hetero male, after all.  But I am looking to create more interesting characters in video games, and having them be scantily-clad only when it makes sense.

To her credit, this list will be a lot easier to create after she's made her videos, as she will have listed a lot of the stereotypes and examples of them.  But I'll start anyhow, with a character design I saw on another Kickstarter project.

----

Chainmail bikini warrior - This woman wears a chainmail bikini, high heels, and a sword.  And nothing else.  There is no backstory for this, and there is no reason.  It's purely for making people drool.  

Fixes - More appropriate armor.  You don't have to remove the curves, just make the armor actually protect the vitals.  Provide somewhere to sheath the sword, and pockets for any items carried.  And some decent shoes/boots that allow for the footwork needed for swordplay.  Give her a backstory as to why her armor is like it is, especially if there are any oddities about it.

----

I'm not a writer, and not good at designing characters.  I really don't know what advice to give in most situations.  That's why I'm looking to get this project started, and hopefully someone with more skill at this will come along and improve it.

The end result of this project should be a campaign for game developers to sign that says they'll do their best to improve characters in video games, and only violate the guidelines when it makes sense, instead of out of laziness.

1336422545.0,110,self.truegaming,tbpg8,So QuakeLive. Why aren't people playing it? I truly believe it is the quintessential e-sports game and no game today has surpassed it in that regard.,johndoe42,173,63,184,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/tbpg8/so_quakelive_why_arent_people_playing_it_i_truly/,"QuakeLive recently tried a push to get more subscribers in by having a free premium weekend. Normally, QL is free to play with a few ads but it also has a premium and pro subscription where players can make custom servers (with options like even faster gameplay) and play on premium maps.

While QuakeLive is essentially an in-browser Quake3, what id has done is made the game suitable for a better multiplayer experience. They have made tiers so newcomers don't get immediately slaughtered by advanced players. They've made the clans and social capabilities seamless. Yet they've had a hard time being more prominent.

Then this past week they've introduced a few more modes that up the ante. They've introduced modes like ""domination"" which a lot of players are familiar with from modern FPS games. They even have an ""attack and defend"" a turn-by-turn capture-the-flag which was incredibly fun in my experience and really made team play fun. We'll see if this causes an increase in subscribers...but it doesn't look good.

As for why QuakeLive is the best e-sports game in my opinion: its a combination of the skill required by the game, the thinking ability and better team play. In Quake, your ability to aim is just the beginning. Also in most games, I don't even feel a connection to my teammates, its all about ""me."" I don't even feel a connection to my opponent. But in Quake, its almost the exact opposite, if one player is slacking off or not contributing it is immediately apparent and the team suffers. You also start to adjust your strategy based on who you're fighting, as different styles lend themselves to different approaches. There's also a certain etiquette, if a team is imbalanced you are asked to sit and wait until someone else comes. The skill level of players is respected, in other words. 

But as for the game's mechanics, the easiest way I can summarize it is with a duel:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdkDjsBiO58

Most games, unfortunately, don't have a viable 1 vs. 1. That's because the extent of ""dueling"" is popping in and out behind cover and waiting for your health to regenerate. For an arena game, resource control is intrinsic to more exciting gameplay. Timing items, positioning yourself on the map, knowing your enemies chosen items, adding his or her armor and health in your head, knowing your own and crafting your engagement around this creates a far more layered battle than just shooting each other in the face. Just to highlight one strategy: if your opponent has a rocket launcher and you have a lightning gun, the intelligent thing to do is to increase your distance so that their % of accuracy decreases, the only thing you have to do is dodge and jump over their rockets while you keep your aim trained on them. You're making these decisions second by second and adjusting them, so its like a mini chess game each encounter. 

Couple this with Capture the Flag or Team Deathmatch and you have an incredibly complex match. Even /r/Starcraft sees this in comparison with other FPS games:

http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/mqu93/who_in_rstarcaft_who_presently_has_no_interest_in/

So the question is, why hasn't it caught on? Is it marketing? Is it just that gamers today don't want that in an FPS and would rather have it in an RTS? Or is the game ahead of its time?

1331500114.0,110,self.truegaming,qrxq3,In the wake of events that transpired with Bioware over the course of last year are you interested in Dragon Age 3?,MaidenMadness,200,90,239,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/qrxq3/in_the_wake_of_events_that_transpired_with/,"Fact of the matter is that for many people, myself included Dragon Age 2 was a disappointment. There are many people that played Mass Effect 3 and were left disappointed after they finished the game because of apparently anti-climatic and disappointing finish to the saga (haven't played Mass Effect 3, so I cannot judge for myself on this point). There are plenty of people outraged over EA/Bioware DLC policy. So events of the past year really have been a huge downfall for Bioware, at least in terms of their image in the eyes of the gaming public.


Oh yeah to warn people text beyond here will contain some major Dragon Age spoilers.

Whereas last year before Dragon Age 2 pretty much everyone gave Bioware full confidence because of their near flawless record I imagine that now the number of people that have full confidence in Bioware delivering an excellent game is significantly smaller.

Personally I don't know how interested in Dragon Age 3 I am. On one hand I invested a lot of time in Dragon Age franchise having played and finished Origins, Awakening and DA2. On another hand I was disappointed with Dragon Age 2 finishing with basically an announcement of Dragon Age 3. Nothing was resolved and all we were left with is a hope that things will be resolved in Dragon Age 3. Now they're saying Dragon Age 3's character won't be Hawke, but some new guy and that Hawke's story will resume in DLCs for DA2 which is far from what we were left to believe before DA2.

We were lead to believe then that Hawke is one of the greatest heroes in the history of Thedas and that DA2 is kinda of an intro to the story of where he came from, and that following games will be centered around him. He was supposed to be Dragon Age's Sheppard.
Dragon Age 2 was just that Hawke: An Intro, but whereas Dragon Age 3 will center around the aftermaths of events of Dragon Age 2, [it will probably feature a new hero](http://www.joystiq.com/2011/08/31/bioware-hints-at-the-future-of-dragon-age-dlc-and-3/) so we still won't know why is he considered to be great. They'll say they'll continue Hawke's story though DLC's for DA2 but that's hardly Shepardly whose story lasted three fucking games (and their DLCs).


So from the outset Dragon Age 3 doesn't look appealing. Wow a story about a war between Templars and Mages that's really creative. It sounds as if somebody took that entire quest line from DA:O and just expanded it to a full game which sounds lazy and quite frankly not too reassuring in the light of how rehashed things in Dragon Age 2 were.  New hero character doesn't help either because if Dragon Age 3 is about a new hero that means that we'll probably never going to get a satisfactory conclusion to Hawke's story.
However if a new hero is actually Bioware's way of saying forget Dragon Age 2, we fucked up big time, let us act as if there never was Dragon Age 2 I'm all for it and am all for new character if it means we get a better product that's not being held by cock ups of the past.
That means I finally get down to gameplay of Dragon Age 2 and... I'm not impressed. Dragon Age 2 combat was pretty but dumb and repetitive. Any attempt to use any tactics was made useless by enemies appearing in waves from thin air in all directions. It was just button mashing which got rather boring pretty quickly. Enemies also weren't particularly impressive. Locations were rather bland and easy to forget. 

Bottom line is that when thinking about Dragon Age 3 I personally see few things which would make me interested in it. Perhaps conclusion to the story about war between mages and templars from DA2 but that's about the only thing I can see which DA3 has going for it and truth be told I didn't find the story of DA2 to be particularly compelling so it's not like I have to know how it ends.

Obviously I understand that it would be hard to account for difficulty and party management with that many people, but I would like to see an honest attempt at something like this. 

As a starting idea, I'd say that all of your party members are always in the field with you; however, you guys are split into teams, and they each act autonomously. Your specific team will be called your ""entourage"" and those are the only guys you can get certain commands to. The other teams handle cover fire, or advancement, or anything else that seems plausible. There would be commands to give them such as ""storm this room,"" but you wouldn't be able to order those in that other team to execute specific commands like ""Lift that enemy."" 

I envision that switching who is in the party should be smooth, but not entirely easy. For example, you could radio that Kaiden switch with Liara and you would see Liara say ""roger"" and head off, but you'd have to wait for Kaiden to make it to where you are before you could give him orders. 

With this you could add a new layer of tactics/puzzle elements to the game similar to FFX's party system. Came across a hackable door, but Tali isn't in your party? Either call her in, or find an alternate route.

Are we being bullied by publishers?,jtm33,155,47,94,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/re3su/regional_game_pricing_and_restrictions_are_we/,"There is a problem in the gaming industry that I don't think gets as much coverage as it deserves. I believe this is because it is an issue that mainly affects people outside of the US. In an industry with US-based media dominating websites it can often be hard to find gaming related content that is not relevant to US consumers. It is a very confusing issue, and bothers me more than any other other trend in gaming at the moment. This will sound a bit like a rant but I hope there is room for discussion about what can possibly be done about this problem. I begin with this picture:
 
http://i.imgur.com/1tt0m.jpg

That is a showcase of a mix of several digital distribution stores, boxed import stores, cd-key sellers, and brick-and-mortar retailers that I may choose to buy my games from. Your likely reaction to seeing all of that is confusion. 

**What's happening here?**

What you are seeing is Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning, published by EA. I choose this as an example, but really most ""AAA"" titles from major publishers in the past few years will show an equally confusing mix of prices. You are seeing it priced at a range of $30.58 - $108.00. You are also seeing some stores not allowing the purchase of this game from my country (Australia). Publishers, and these retailers, are charging us a lot more to buy their games. It can sometimes cost up to three times as much to buy from a local store than to buy online. Now to be clear this is not an Australia specific problem, however it is probably worse here than in many other places.

**What does this mean?**

This means whenever I want to buy a new game I am faced with the reality of usually paying $85-120 ($89-$125USD) to buy it from a local store, or to jump online and search for a way to buy it at a fair price. For PC games this usually involves checking half a dozen digital distribution stores. If there is no fair deal there I will check cd-key resellers, usually for a Steam or Origin key. If there is no success there  or I am buying a console game I will look at boxed import stores, which post you a boxed copy of the game from overseas. If I don't want to pay the price of a boxed import or cannot otherwise find a fair price I wait for a sale to bring the price down.

Sometimes it is not about pricing. European people will be very familiar with the idea of having games released later in the week than in the US. An extreme example of this is ""The Old Republic"" not releasing in Australia until this month. Regional lockouts for digital stores is a widespread, massive problem affecting not only games.

**Why is this a problem?**

A summary of the issues that I regularly face should highlight why this trend is troubling.

- I cannot buy from a local retail store without paying twice as much for games.

- If I want to buy digitally I am often faced with 50% mark-ups or locked out from buying at all.

- Digital games are often released later than in the US.

- I can get a boxed copy of a game shipped to the other side of the Earth and pay less than half than what it costs for me to walk down the street and buy it there.

- But I have to wait 1-2 weeks for my boxed copy from across the Earth to arrive.

- Some region restrictions may mean I have no legitimate avenue to buy a game I want.

With that summarised I get to the crux of this rant:

**The game industry is over 30 years old, why are you so bothered now?**

A brief history lesson. Games have always been expensive here. Everything is expensive here. I grew up without a games console until a bought a PS2 with my own money in 2005. Most of my gaming growing up was on our PC, almost all of the games pirated. All console gaming was at friends' places. In the past 5-10 years digital distribution and online commerce has opened up the door to a new world of cheaper, easier to buy products. For games it is easy to see how digital distribution is the future. It is not only the future of distribution, it is the end of horrifically expensive gaming here. Or so I thought when I made my Steam account in 2007.

Then something happened. I cannot remember many specifics but in 2009, COD:Modern Warfare 2 appeared on Steam for $90 USD. In the past 2 years I bought most of my games on Steam, at US prices. From here it seems begins a trend of most major publishers on Steam increasing the price of games in Australia. Europeans will be familiar with the $1 = 1Euro paradox. 

Thankfully I have discovered other avenues to pay a fair price for games, but the sad thing is that I can no longer support promising technology like Steam and Origin, when they expect me to pay twice as much for the privilege. PC games have crept up from their old standard of $50 too.

**So why is this happening?**

From my understanding:

- Publishers control most of these issues, and are to blame. Retailers are partially responsible, but they have to compete with other retailers.

- Retailers have no choice. Sometimes, retailers have to agree to not sell games in certain regions. Sometimes they have to buy from sources that charge high prices to retailers.

- They are trying to take distribution methods, pricing, and other restrictions that are intrinsic to to physical distribution in a brick-and-mortar store and apply it to digital stores.

- They think regional pricing is effective in a world where buying a boxed or digital game from across the world is easy and cheap.

- Publishers are trying to appease retailers by artificially increasing prices so as to not undercut brick-and-mortar stores which are still a large part of the industry.

**What can be done?**

I see the recent discussion and controversy about DLC and charging full price for an incomplete game. It can be hard to get angry about charging $10 extra for DLC when we are being asked to spend an extra $60 for the base game. I have thought about the commonly recited methods of protest: do not buy, pirate, write letters... whatever. This kind of passive protesting hasn't changed anything. The trend at the moment is scary. Increasingly restrictive DRM, higher prices, more DLC, more exploitation.

I will end with how a feel about all of this, and hopefully a point from where we can have some discussion:

I am sick of being treated like an idiot, a fool, someone to be exploited and to readily accept whatever the game industry thinks is right or that they can get away with. When we complain, nobody listens, and I feel powerless to do anything about stopping these grim industry trends.

1322963496.0,105,self.truegaming,mzas9,Does the Auteur Theory apply to video games?,Gumbee,145,40,70,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/mzas9/does_the_auteur_theory_apply_to_video_games/,"In 1954 there was this little French guy called Fancois Truffaut.  You may have heard his name mentioned once or twice in the pretentious rantings of a film-school dropout while trying to enjoy your Starbucks latte, but, for the uninitiated, Truffaut was an influential film director and critic (The 400 Blows, The Last Metro), and the creator of the auteur theory.  The film theoretician, André Bazin, explained that:  the auteur theory is a way of choosing the personal factor in artistic creation as a standard of reference, and then assuming that it continues and even progresses from one film to the next.  Basically, the auteur theory states that a director's vision is translated in it's entirety on to all of his / her films, as if he / she were the sole creator, or ""author"" of all of their work.  

The Coen Brothers are often used to exemplify the theory: with each new film they make, the cast, producers, and everyone behind the scenes may change, but the film they produce is always undeniably a Coen Brothers film.  As filmmakers, their work always conveys a certain series of messages and themes (the power, or lack thereof of money, naivety, ignorance triumphing over power etc.) that is distinctly theirs. 

So, the question of the day is: does this apply to video games?  As a form of art, do we yet have our own auteurs?  Does Truffaut's assertion that ""there are no good and bad movies, only good and bad directors"" ring true for video games as well?  Is the work of an auteur typically better than that of his peers?  What role in the development of a video game deserves credit for authorship?

Let’s first start with the latter.  In gaming, what tends to be the most recognizable figure behind any body of work is the studio that produces it.  World of Warcraft isn't the creation of one individual person, but a collection of people instead.  People attribute the creation of the Mass Effect series to Bioware, and not it's executive producer Casey Hudson.  For the most part gamer, and game developer alike seem reluctant to praise the individual.  Video game development is perceived as being such a largely collaborative effort that the credit is most often attributed to the team behind the game, and not the person.  But is there ever a singular person that deserves the credit for the creation of a video game?  Right now, the answer tends to be no, but it's quickly becoming the opposite.

What seems to be the highest critical praise for any video game developer is the disassociation of his / her name from the company they work for (or own in some cases).  These people, the ones we know by name, tend to be developers with large bodies of work, the majority of which have seen success with both critics, and gamers alike.  These are our auteurs:

**Tim Schafer** (Double Fine): Schafer’s game’s often focus on mortality, and are darkly comedic.  The characters he creates are uniquely stylized, and often exist in worlds that are a dark, satirical, or heightened take on our own.

**Will Wright** (Maxis): The king of simulation, Wright’s games allow players to experience facets of life they wouldn’t otherwise be able to.  His breadth of work varies from the fantastical (Spore), to the mundane (Sims), but at the core of each of his games is life. 

**Ken Levine** (Irrational Games): Isolation, and the struggle against unimaginable and often faceless evil is at the center of Levine’s work.  His characters are often ciphers to which the player can attach their own character traits, flaws, and fears.

**Fumito Ueda** (Team Ico): Ueda can best be described as a minimalist.  His games derive the bulk of their power not from fanciful visuals, lush environments, or overwhelming graphical effects, but from narrative, and the characters that exist within it.  His games often focus on isolation, loneliness, and the lack of power against evil.

These designers, as well as artists like Peter Molyneux, Hideo Kojima, and Shigeru Miyamoto (among others) are all people who have been making creatively distinctive works within the video gaming industry for the entirety of their careers.  All of those names are instantly recognizable to any gamer with even the slightest bit of erudity.  These are people whom, among hearing of their plans to release a new game, we can immediately begin to form an idea of what sort of themes, messages, tone, and visual style will be contained within it.  

Unfortunately, they represent a pretty small minority of the people currently making video games.  But not for long.  As the popularity of the indie game scene increases, so do the number of auteur developers.  However, the real question remains: does an auteur produce better work?  Should we actively be encouraging less involvement from the studio system in the development of our games and encourage the individual to put their own unique stamps on the products they oversee?

Well duh, of course we should!  By and large the video game industry is one driven almost entirely by profit.  Big tent-pole games are incredibly expensive to develop, so if an aspiring creative director wants to become a big name like some of the guys mentioned above, chances are, barring some incredible luck, if he wants to have his vision translated onto the screen through a big-budget video game he's going to have to bend to the whims of the people funding said vision on a number of occasions throughout it's development.  This often results in games that shades of the original vision and, well, aren't really worth being proud of.  This is why we're currently seeing such an influx of indie developers.  A game like Braid could not have existed under the studio system.  It took Jonathan Blow sitting in his apartment for hours every day to create what is one of the most uncompromising artistic visions gamers have ever seen.  

So yes, the auteur theory can be applied to video game developers, and the people that the auteur theory refers to as auteur do, more often than not, produce a higher calibre of art.  Auteur's are, for the most part, few and far between in the video games industry, but that will soon change.  As small, cheap indie projects continue to show that not only are they capable of producing great games, but also making large profits off of them, studios will take interest.  The typical video game auteur is currently by and large an unknown starving artist, but as time progresses we may be able to add some names to the list up there.

1330272609.0,109,self.truegaming,q6rts,Kingdoms of Amalur: The Grind,Gringos,171,62,151,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/q6rts/kingdoms_of_amalur_the_grind/,"Two weeks ago I bought a game on steam because it was always compared to Fable in the media, one of my favorite games to think back to. Now I have reached my 60th hour in Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning. Yet I am not done with the game. Or rather, the game is not done with me.

I'm halfway through Klurikon, the 4th of the 5 regions the game has to offer. You could say I am a completionist, so I exlored every corner of the map, fought every foe and activated all of the lorestones (the games method of telling you backstory) I could up until the point I am now. 

The problem is that I struggle to continue. 

The game felt hour after hour more like a grind to me. Encounter enemy, left click to death, loot, add stuff to junk pick up the rest. That chain interrupted by the occasional chest and always the same lockpicking/dispelling minigame and of course running to the next enemy/chest/lorestone/questgiver. 

Speaking of Quests, they do little to help. There's never more than the MMORPG typical ""Kill this!"", ""Fetch that in this number!"" or ""Talk to that guy!"". There are decisions to be made that actually bring an ounce of fun and individuality back to the game, but they are very rare in comparison to Bioware RPG's. Just an example: In a quest chain early in the game you get to decide if you want to kill the villain or rule the good people with the villain. That's a huge decision, but it's on the same hand pretty much the first in the game and took a good amount of 5 hours to get to.

That's the crux of the problem I was encountering with KoA. But it's not everything yet, on to the characterspecifics!

I chose to level a rogue/mage combination, as you can do. I love that you get such a variety in skilling possibilities, it's one of the strongpoints that the game has. Sadly you don't get much to play with. 

For a good amount of 20 hours I had a total of 3 attack spells in the mage tree and one passive envenom for my weapons in the rogue tree. In addition, some more or less useful combo attacks and passive damage boosts for weapons were unlocked. You get a variety of 3 weapons per skill tree, I chose to go with daggers and chakrams (because you need a lot of points to do it effectively). That said, there wasn't much variety in the way I could fight enemies. 40 hours later you get AoE spells in the mage tree and more passives+a smokebomb in the other.

Left click them with daggers or with chakrams? Right click them with lightning, ice or fire? That's what it came down to.

Lastly I want to talk about the difficulty. I play on hard. It is a joke. The few times I died in my playtime are credited to my early encounters with groups of sprites who tend to swarm you and attack you one after another, interrupting everything you try to cast or do. Every other enemy in the game was not able to scratch me. That is mainly because of three factors:

* You can enter a fate-berzerk mode and deal approximately twice your damage and gain twice the XP, while enemies are slowed. This is of course limited and you have to charge up by striking enemies for a good amount of time (or chug down lategame fate potions). The game basically encourages you to save this up for bosses. In all of my playtime I died to exactly one boss and that was because I misjudged the dungeon and blew my fate-mode on a mini boss (and the main boss summoned - of course - sprites). 

* Healthpotions have no cooldown. You can stock on them as much as you want and even drink them while you are stunned. There is an ability in the mage tree to heal yourself, but with unlimited healthpotions this is useless.

* Blacksmithing in combination with Sagecrafting is much like in Skyrim with Enchanting completely overpowered. As min-maxing player, you find yourself stumbling upon components that increase your damage by +19%(!) and a Gem that increases damage by 15% and damage resistance by 10%. I barely find anything that is better than my current equipment, especially since there are 3 armor types and 9 weapon types.

That's it. I had to get this off my chest. I will still finish the game since the story originally really interested me and had great poetry to it. What do you guys think about the game? Am I doing anything wrong or do you encounter the same problem as I did?

**tl;dr** KoA:R feels like a grind because the game has too much content without gaining variety.

Sometimes I don't have the will to put a lot of work into it or I just don't have the time. Sometimes I get home and I just want to mess around in a game world. In a game like GTA I might just drive around aimlessly looking for ramps to drive my car over.

I find that there's a very delicate balance of work and play in video games. It seems to me like most games require at least some level of work. In RTS games, you'll have to manage hundreds of units to win a match. In an RPG, you'll have to level grind to be able to beat a boss. In a game like EVE online you might get to a point to where you're basically making formulas in spreadsheets to see if doing something is going to be profitable or not. In a Civ-like game, you're building an empire from scratch which quite frankly takes a lot of work. And there are many other examples.

Sometimes I'll look at a new game and realize how much effort and work it'll take to figure out how to play and what to do or all the grinding that I'll have to do and it'll turn me off from playing the game. I might look at a game that I really enjoy, but not want to play it because it would take too much work. Sometimes I'll want to continue playing a game and I won't because it'll take too much work to figure out where I am in the game or what I have to do.

With respect to managing resources in games, it might be nice to see some options to allow those tedious actions to be automated. Let's say you have a tycoon type game where you have to manage a theme park or whatever. It would be nice to delegate some of the more tedious tasks to NPC managers who could take a basic set of instructions and take care of a certain part of your business. Or maybe in an RTS, you could have NPC generals who can manage some of your units for you and you could just give some basic instructions to those generals. Of course this can get to the point where you're almost not even playing the game anymore and just basically running a simulation. 

I am finding that I am getting more and more reluctant to do quests or anything to progress the story and more time just messing around trying to stir up some shit or explore the world. I don't really care if the world is in peril and I need to act to save it. I would rather explore what's in that cave over there or what's over that hill. Sometimes I don't want to be told what to do and I am definitely finding myself playing more games that allow me to do whatever I want. 

There are a lot of games that are requiring their players to have to jump through hoops just to be able to unlock things. The Battlefield games require you to collect ""experience"" to unlock abilities and weapons. I feel that such a system for a shooter is completely unfair. It takes a new player a lot of work to get to the same level as older players because in order to become a somewhat decent player they have to spend hours trying to unlock med packs or defibrillators or ammo packs or whatever. This puts them at a severe disadvantage and makes the game a lot more laborious than it has to be. I can see a lot of new players being turned off by the prospect of having to spend so much time basically handicapped and for what? Of course I can see why the experience system can be popular. People like the sense of achievement and superiority it can bring. I, personally, would like to see a version of BF where you don't have to collect experience to unlock in-game items and everyone starts with the same things. 

What are some of your thoughts on work in video games? What counts as play? What are some examples of work and play being well balanced within a game? Ideas for cutting down work in games? Is it always necessary to do some work to have some fun in a game? Is it necessary to have to spend hours grinding to unlock some weapon? If you love to grind, why do you think that is?

Edit:
This discussion is really great. I think a lot of you really get where I am coming from. Maybe we're at the same stage in our lives. We're more experienced and have a lot more going on in our lives than 10 or 15 years ago. 

Some people were asking my age. I'm 24 at the moment going on 25. I live a pretty busy life. I have less time usually to just sink into gaming than say 10 years ago. I think that factors into how I see games now. 

I used to have absolutely no problem sinking a ton of time into a game like EVE Online and figuring out how things worked and how to make a profit in game through a variety of different means or helping organize a group of people to get ready for battle against another group of players. Nowadays when I want to game, I want to be able to jump in and get right into the good stuff. Like in Battefield, I want to get right into the thick of the action and run around arming MCOMs, flanking the enemy and just going all out Rambo on the other team. If I need to do something else I can just put the game down right away and go do that other thing. 

Some of you mentioned how indie games are pushing the game-play envelope and I would have to agree. I have been enjoying a lot of great indie games lately just because of how unique they are. It's not the same dish as you get with most AAA titles. They are trying something very risky and in a lot of cases I would say that they are helping push the medium of gaming forward.

1318336211.0,110,self.truegaming,l87kp,FPS Damage Models,Glorin,126,16,77,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/l87kp/fps_damage_models/,"What are everyone's thoughts on gameplay implications of damage models in FPS games?  

In other words, what do you think it means in terms of gameplay when the average gun in a game has a Time To Kill of 130ms? 160ms? 480ms? 560ms?

In order, those numbers are Black Ops AUG, Black Ops AK47, Bad Company 2 XM8 Magnum, Bad Company 2 XM8 non-magnum.

Another thing to consider is that there is a difference between 'ideal' TTK and 'true' TTK.  Ideal Time to Kill is landing every bullet accurately and consecutively to result in the fastest possible kill.  True TTK is what happens when actually playing, which involves the weapon's visual recoil, effective recoil, spread, spread rate, ADS time, input lag, latency, netcode, etc.

Put simply: In Black Ops you kill people in three hits barring headshots.  It also happens that a three round burst in Black Ops is generally perfectly accurate.

In Bad Company 2 you kill people in six hits barring headshots, however a six round burst is often times inaccurate.  If you work out the fire rate in a macro, you generally have to wait ~120ms between 3 round bursts in order to kill someone as quickly as possible at medium range, resulting in a 240ms + 120ms + 240ms = 600ms TTK starting from the first bullet to the last bullet.

What does this mean?  It means in non-hardcore mode, you can expect to kill people within 160ms in Black Ops, and in ~600ms in Bad Company 2.  As a reference, human reaction time is around 185ms for gamers.

Personally, I believe that as TTK increases, you have a non linear impact on gameplay speed.  For example:

+ &lt;160ms TTK = Extremely Slow Gameplay

+ 160ms - 400ms TKK = Moderately Fast Gameplay

+ 400ms - 600ms TKK = Moderately Slow Gameplay

+ 600ms TKK and above = Extremely Fast Gameplay

The first range results in slow gameplay because you cannot move without risking death.  If anyone has even the slightest situational advantage over you, then you die.  All gameplay tends to generally slow down as most players attempt to gain a situational advantage over their opponents (playing tactically).  Think hardcore in Call of Duty; its much slower than softcore.

The second range results in much faster gameplay because the TKK is slow enough so as to not be an automatic death sentence if you run around, but its fast enough to make aggressive play highly effective.  If you're in a position, flanking or simply suprising your enemy, then you can move target to target fast enough for killing multiple opponents.  The general result is that it is now possible basically prevent yourself from dying by killing your opponents.  It sounds silly, but the best string of kills happen by cutting a swath through your opponents and then slaughtering them when you're pushed up so far that they're not ready for you.  The entirety of the Call of Duty playstyle is based off of this TTK range.

I would argue that the 400 to 600ms TTK range actually slows down gameplay from the Call of Duty levels because it is much harder to down opponents as they move cover to cover.  This TTK range puts a large emphasis on headshots (good in my opinion), but it also makes it so that multi kills are much rarer.   Think Bad Company 2.

Anything over 600ms I would argue drastically increases the speed of the gameplay because there is very little danger in moving quickly through a map.  Firefights are often not won through situational advantages, but rather twitch gameplay.  For example, your ability to trace targets, dodge, and to take small advantages and amplify them.  Think Quake.

1364463124.0,110,self.truegaming,1b63cs,Reinventing the Square Wheel in Game Design,Provic,201,91,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1b63cs/reinventing_the_square_wheel_in_game_design/,"One of the things that I've noticed over several years of playing games is many development houses have been repeating the same mistakes when implementing very common features or mechanics, despite perfectly good solutions already having been designed years before. It's certainly not a super-widespread problem, but it does seem to give some insight into the development process.

The most common example I can think of as a case study is the Capture the Flag mechanic. It's appeared in almost every multiplayer game genre in some shape or form; there are games based entirely around the mechanic, in others it's a game mode, and in others it's a side-option or minigame. Overall, there are at least hundreds and possibly thousands of games that implement it.

You see some variation of it in almost every competitive FPS, but it also shows up quite frequently in MMORPGs, many third-person shooters, and I've even seen strange variants of it in racing games and RTSes.

It's also older than dirt. In the FPS sphere, it was extremely popular as far back as 1996 (Team Fortress for the original Quake), but notable examples of it exist before then as well. The first Unreal Tournament had a CTF game mode as of 1999. Almost every game in the MMORPG genre that does ""battleground""-style PvP has it as a match mode.

So... why do we keep seeing the same flawed mechanics and the same awkward ""fix"" attempts? And I'm not referring to bugs and boring level design here, but basic game theory stuff. The standard setup for a CTF match effectively forces players to adopt a number of specific strategies, many of which actively obstruct their enjoyment of the game. And they can't help it, because if they don't use these fun-killing strategies, they'll end up losing because the other side will.

For instance, if the friendly flag needs to be ""home"" to score, it basically forces players to adopt a ""turtle"" strategy when both flags have been picked up, leading to a prolonged deadlock. It also encourages flag carriers to exploit any deficiencies in level design to hide themselves in an easily defensible area, whereas under normal circumstances these deficiencies wouldn't be a problem.

Scoring and reward structures are also often a problem. Many games dramatically under-value actually achieving the objectives in favor of individual PvP combat results. This means that the optimal point-scoring approach for players is to completely disregard the flag and treat the match as a glorified deathmatch. In any match where players aren't in a supervised group (like a clan or guild), a substantial portion of the players will do exactly that, leading to low scores (if the match is timed) or a needlessly long match (if the win condition is a fixed number of captures).

There are frequently issues with the environment/level design as well: central bottlenecks and poorly-placed respawn areas condemn players to an endless and tedious [defeat in detail](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defeat_in_detail) when attacking unless they properly organize themselves, something which random ""pub"" groups of players generally do not do well. As a result, the gameplay devolves into glorified team deathmatch and the objectives are ignored. It essentially transfers responsibility for engaging gameplay from the designer to the players, and the players aren't very good at it.

The problem is that almost all of these problems *have already been solved ages ago*. QuakeWorld Team Fortress had *exceptionally* solid Capture the Flag gameplay in **1996**. The canonical example is the well-known ""2Fort"" map which has been reproduced in essentially every Team Fortress-inspired game since. It handled respawning very cleanly, avoided the ""turtling"" mechanic by placing the capture points far from the flag rooms and not requiring the friendly flag to be present, and had enough alternate paths that deathmatch was *possible*, but not *required*. Even if most players were engaged in a perpetual melée in the middle, a small group from either team could still get through and extract the enemy flag.

The Unreal Tournament series also handled CTF quite well, with a number of mechanics in the underlying game helping to avoid the common problems without having to implement individual solutions. The fast-paced nature of the game ensured that flag carriers were relatively fragile, and the extremely high mobility of individual players made it easy to bypass bottlenecks. Most maps for the game were also very large and open, which helped as well.

And yet no one seems to learn from this. Every time an MMORPG or new shooter gets released with a CTF mode, the **same** complaints show up on message boards. They'll obviously be framed as problems with the *specific* game, but the truth is that the issues are far more general game theory problems that affect the mechanic no matter what context it's placed in. And they've already been solved.

Some of the ""solutions"" to these complaints are mind-bogglingly terrible, as well. I've seen speed penalties applied to flag carriers after a certain point (which doesn't really do anything to prevent a deadlock scenario and is irrelevant if a player can reset the penalty by just dropping the flag for a teammate to pick up). In other cases, games will be declared a draw if no captures occur for a certain period of time. Most of these poorly-conceived ""fixes"" have in common that they're bandage solutions to treat symptoms rather than causes, and ultimately do little to restore any depth to the gameplay since the elephant in the room is overlooked (the huge unavoidable open area in the middle of the map, for instance).

So I've droned on and on about Capture the Flag and how people are terrible at implementing it, but the bigger point is that this kind of ""reinventing the square wheel"" design, where not only are the same mechanics being reproduced with little originality, but fairly obvious historical solutions to common problems are overlooked. I'm not sure if this means that we should expect designers to have a more varied and eclectic background in gaming in general (so they would be more familiar with those existing solutions), or whether this is just something we're going to have to live with.",,False,,t5_2sgq6,False,,,True,t3_1b63cs,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1b63cs/reinventing_the_square_wheel_in_game_design/,

From the various discussions I've read about game DRM and piracy, I've noticed a common justification for pirating PC games is to ""try it before you buy it."" This is a valid point, especially for those who are unsure if their computers will even run the latest releases acceptably; it's hard to justify spending $40 - $60 (nonrefundable, at that) without knowing for sure if the game will work as advertised. On the developer side of things, PC game demos [have been in decline](http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/05/26/the-slow-strange-death-of-the-demo/) ever since the demo-disc-and-shareware golden era of the 1990s. Making a demo cuts into precious development resources and, executed improperly, could even cut into sales as people exploit the demo to turn it into a good approximation of the full product -- my younger self did so with the old 30-minute SimCity 2000 demo to sidestep the timer.

When Diablo III came out a few weeks ago, I really wasn't interested in purchasing it just yet, but I was curious how it would perform on my budget gaming machine. Luckily, I was able to acquire a D3 guest pass, which authorized my Battle.net account to play the game through the first boss. Attempting to log into D3 with an account lacking this authorization results in a ""nope, you can't do that with this account"" message. This sort of online DRM gets a lot of flak, rightfully so in some cases.

To look at it from a different perspective though, systems like Battle.net and Steam also allow developers to open up parts of their game for potential buyers to try, all without having to worry as much about people exploiting the demo or doing more work themselves to carve up and repackage the original game into a demo. Portal: The First Slice and free-multiplayer weekends for Modern Warfare and Team Fortress 2 (pre-F2P) come to mind. Additionally, in Diablo III's case, upgrading to the full version requires little more than plugging in your credit card number to authorize your account for all the content, and you get to retain the progress you made in the demo. With all this, players once again get to try out games before purchasing, while developers have to do little additional work to make a suitable demo and lower the hassle of buying the full game to almost nothing.

Perhaps we'll see more developers using online DRM systems to lure in new players? Thoughts?

Real, real sorry to have to submit another self-post so soon after the last one, but it proved to be of such great importance that I can't reply to every person individually.  I believe I have a solution, though.  Brace yourselves, this is a long one.

Key point to think about throughout: we don't have link posts around here.  Only self.  Only text.  That means we essentially function not so much as a subreddit, but a gaming forum.  However, we're still bound by the reddit upvote/downvote system.  Some might view this as awkward, but I want to turn it to our advantage.  I want to create a hybrid reddit/forum.  Keep this in mind, and let me know what you think of my proposal.

**Why We Can't Become Hypocrites**

What we want here is long, winding discussions of things we enjoy talking about, hearing different viewpoints and thinking about things, yes?  The problem is that if truegaming continues to grow, that's going to become harder to find.  Stricter moderation is usually considered the answer, but the harsh truth is that you can't claim to promote free speech, acceptance and understanding by introducing ever more specific rules into a system that's supposed to be democratic.  You simply can't.  We have upvotes and downvotes for a reason.

A lot of you might find this melodramatic, and in a way, you're correct.  The internet is not, after all, srs business.  If you start a club, you have every right to determine who gets to be in it and what the rules are.  That's absolutely true.  On the other hand, I'm beginning to think that it's not enough to just talk about things.  You have to live them, every single day.  If I believe in a forum that can comfortably cater to most audiences while encouraging and standing for the things I'm passionate about, I can't be content with just talking about how it *should* be and getting pissed when it doesn't turn out that way.  What I'm getting at is that stricter moderation is the easy way out, the convenient but ultimately ineffective salve to a complex wound.  I don't want to be a hypocrite that tries to encourage everyone to talk freely about the things they love and try to gain some perspective and understanding from others while banning posts.

So we can't ban posts while preaching tolerance, and we can't get to a place where everyone is happy with their front page.  What's the solution?

**Upvotes and downvotes.**

I know what you're thinking.  They don't work, right?  People, generally, will just upvote whatever they like.  That's just it, they only upvote *things they like*.  Not what they want to see on the front page.  They have no concern for the community.  This is not a bad thing!  It's kind of like going to a band's website to check tour dates without stopping by the forum, only they get their muddy footprints all over the new carpet when they do.

Commenters, on the other hand, are the people who care about the front page.  They are people who care about the idea of the community as much as, if not more than, the links.  That's why they comment, to contribute.  Unfortunately, the number of people who vote far, far outweighs the commenters.  So we end up with this weird dynamic where everybody seems to hate the content but it keeps getting to the front page anyway.

This makes for pissed-off, jaded comment sections.  You've seen them yourself.  Since all we have is our comment sections, I'd rather this didn't happen, but if the voters outweigh the commenters, how can we ever assume some form of limited democratic control?  How does voting help?

First of all, we're essentially a community of commenters, so it's in our nature to give a shit.  We're still small enough to take charge against the inevitable noise of the internet without excluding anyone.

Second of all, people view the front page as glory and being consigned to new as failure.  I believe this, more than anything else, causes the problems that reddit faces.  But we don't have to see it that way.

**A new model.**

I envision a system where the front page is not necessarily held in higher esteem than new.  New usually functions as the bottom of the barrel.  Plenty of people don't even go there because the content range is a lot wider.  Posts don't get seen so much, and drip into oblivion, hardly gaining any votes.  What I propose is that we view new less as a graveyard of terrible threads, and more as one part of a two-part sorting system.  New is for quick moving, more common threads.  DAE like Morrowind?  Maybe you feel like chatting Morrowind for a while.  You might tell a story, strike up a brief conversation with someone over build types, spot a link for a cool mod you've never heard of.  There's absolutely nothing wrong with that.  Everyone loves a little nostalgia trip from time to time, or to not be judged too harshly for their words.  Just some moreso than others.

So downvotes needn't be seen as a badge of failure.  They've simply been 'sorted' into another content category.  No matter how mercilessly downvoted it is, it'll remain on new for the same amount of time as every other thread.  The downvoters wouldn't be saying ""this is shit and it doesn't belong here"", they'd be saying ""when I'm the mood for trawling a 300 post thread, I don't really want it to be about something we talked about two days ago"".  It would be perfectly acceptable to leave a nice comment but downvote.

It's not expressing approval or disapproval:  it's like maintaining a library.  We're not judging the worth of the content but the categorisation.  And people are free to browse and comment on the 'new' category when they feel like shooting the shit casually over a game with the people of this community.  It's not a bad thing to do, it's just casual fun that's immediate, constantly-moving and ""kept off the front page"".  

**This sounds unsettlingly like 'effort'...**

What I'm asking is for the community's help to implement this change, and it starts by voting.  The problem is that many people don't vote.  Maybe you don't.  I'm very miserly with votes myself.  You know why?  Because I can't be bothered.  I can't be bothered looking at every single link I come across, figuring out if it's in line with the community, judging its content and voting based on that, so I don't.  I'm not lazy, it's just an unreasonable demand to make of we creatures of convenience.

So what I've begun doing is voting only on content that *really* provokes me.  If I don't feel a strong feeling one way or the other after half a second, no vote at all.  If it's something to be upvoted, I have to see it and feel immediately that it's an example of what I want MY front page to look like.  Downvoted, and I have to immediately think ""No, oh no, no fucking way, not this shit again, I am so sick and tired of these fucking jokes, I never want to watch Futurama again as long as I fucking live,"" before I'll downvote.  Result?  I cast a lot more votes than I used to.  I don't get mad, I don't expect an immediate reward, I just do it, and it means more total votes.

**A typical hour on truegaming.**

* Becky goes to truegaming with the intent of finding something fresh to think about.
* Upon review of the front page, she sees a link called ""I think it's time we admitted that consoles are simply inferior to PCs"" and says no, uh-uh, not this master race shit again, and downvotes it.
* She reads a couple of threads and comments, not bothering to upvote or downvote because, while she felt like talking, it wasn't *that* interesting.  She enjoys the discussion, but she would not be heartbroken if a similar thread didn't appear on her front page.
* Bored of long-winded treatises on the revolutionary-but-underappreciated mechanics of obscure Cave shooters, she decides to hit the new section and see if there's something a bit more fun going on there.  Maybe ""Review a game in five words!"" or something.
* This time, there are two threads she doesn't want anywhere near the front page category.  Quick downvotes for each, but she comments on one because they mentioned a secret love for Diner Dash and us Diner Dash afficionados gotta stick together.
* Comments on a thread about Skyrim rumors.  Doesn't vote.
* Spots criticism of Braid's pretentious poetry, really enjoys the read.  Doesn't comment, but upvotes, because she digs in-depth destruction of sacred cows.

That's how it would work.  No judgement, no arguments about the correct content, just people catering their experience to their mood with two different forums, one slower-moving with more in-depth conversations and one more immediate, but both featuring exactly the same users.

If you made it through that, you are a being of indomitable will.  I'm sorry I couldn't express it any more concisely, but I believe I've covered most of the ground, and I really think this could be an interesting new way to combat the faults that seem to plague every subreddit while not losing our freedom of choice.

I am currently living in Argentina where gaming is a complicated hobby. It is so, because of the huge import taxes and exchange rate. Our ""official"" exchange rate is roughly 5 ARS -&gt; 1 USD. I write official in quotes as the government is currently limiting the amount of USD we can get to contain the galloping inflation here. The black market value is closer to 8 ARS -&gt; 1 USD. 

I am not poor by any means but to pay 2500 ARS (in an e-bay kind of site) or 3500 ARS in the Sony store for a vita is simply too much. That being said one could spend that amount as a onetime investment, if the games weren’t extremely expensive as well. 500 ARS for a vita game is again too much (price at the moment of launch, then they drop a bit). To give you an idea, the cost of a vita here is roughly 30%-50% of a salary. Games go probably for 10%-15% of a regular income.


A few questions to all gamers in different countries:


1) Do these percentages also reflect the chunk of income you have to spend for this hobby?


2) Considering the fact that no one here wants to pay these prices for retail games, why do game companies not open the credit cards here for digital purchases? I can’t buy anything from the Sony store without getting a prepaid game card which is also more expensive here. A 50 USD card goes roughly for 70 USD.

Of course, you can upgrade your character, but you do this by learning new skills and getting items. These would be varied and interesting, more similar to DnD and not armor for each of your 20 item slots that each give you +50 strength.

As far as enemies, there would no longer be room for level 10 giants that you can faceroll. Even if your character is powerful enough to potentially solo a giant, it can still whack you like a golf ball just because of the difference in size, and you would have to take that into account when fighting them.

Maybe you have heard of it. If you frequent Reddit (/truegaming especially) or any other gaming website, you have had to have seen it. Well, if not, click that link. If you're not into link clicking (I don't blame you, the Internet IS a scary place), then let me tell you what OUYA is in one sentence. Ouya is a new TV gaming console that is being Kickstarted, and at the price of $99, you can get one for yourself. 

The Ouya Kickstarter campaign is the second highest grossing Kickstarter project to date. Within two days, at the time of writing this, 28k people have helped raise 3.5 million USD (with an initial goal of ~1 million USD). This is really impressive, and I think it goes to show there are people with their wallets ready to support a new home TV gaming experience.

Compare this to the [Double Fine Adventure Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/doublefine/double-fine-adventure), which raised 3.3 million USD over the course of about a month with 87k backers. The important thing to note is the difference in the numbers of supporters. While there is quite a lot of time left for the Ouya number of backers to jump up, I get the feeling that initial burst of media coverage and hype is going to slow down a bit. The reason why the total is so high is because most of the backers are pledging around 100 USD in order to get the console. Basically, it's a higher priced lowest tier to get the product that the Kickstarter is for.

The reason why the Ouya is such a Big Deal right now is because it is not backed by the Big Three (Nintendo, Sony, or Microsoft). It's an independent company that has set out to create an open platform for video games. That's really a big thing to undertake.

Watching the Kickstarter video and reading through what Ouya is, it is really quite interesting. I think, if successful (not the Kickstarter, but as a product), that there will be more opportunities for products like this to emerge.

I view this is the first step into something that can change the landscape of console video games. And if you've ever tried anything new in your entire life, you always start by failing and tripping on your own feet.

I think there are some glaring problems with Ouya, and that's what I want to help point out and discuss.

* First and foremost, the name is dumb. Ouya. It is hard to pronounce, and I do not think it is fun to say. Is it EW-YAH or OH-YAH? When I read it and say it, I just don't get it. I think this project would benefit largely from a different name.
* I think the console is ugly looking. It does not have the Wow Factor or sleekness of Sony consoles or the compactness and simpleness of Nintendo consoles. I think simple is the way to go with lower-priced hardware. The design of the [Roku](http://www.roku.com/) is a great example of what I want out of something like this.
* How is the App Store on the device going to handled? From the perspective of a developer, this is what interests me the most. Is there going to be Constant Online DRM? Is there going to be an Approval Process? Where is the line drawn and what measures are going to be taken to make this a viable and worthwhile solution for developers?
* What are game purchases tied to? Are they tied to an account or the system? It is really important to me that there is a future planned out for this platform. It is hard to really say, hey let me purchase this and games on it when I am not too sure if it will exist after this iteration. When I purchase a game on Steam or PS3, I expect to be able to play that long into the future.
* It seems far too early and far too high-level still to commit to this project. I want it to succeed and be awesome, but when mock-ups and the same intro sequence is shown multiple times and not much else is shown, it is hard to really know what you're backing. Don't make a Kickstarter until you have some to really show off. That's the problem with a lot of Kickstarters. Double Fine's Adventure was a Kickstarter to Start a Game. It is hard to get behind and back a project that does not even exist, conceptually, yet. Kickstarter projects and products need to be further along into development before asking for people's money.
* From the viewpoint of a developer, let's say that 100k people back the project. Let's say that another 100k decide to purchase it once reviews come in and it hits the market. Let's just say that within six months of release there are 300k people who purchase the device. That is not at all a large install base. Selling any digital product (or even ads in that sense) are a numbers game. For it to be a successful and viable place for developers, there needs to be a much larger install base. I am doubtful that it will be able to reach the audience it needs to be successful.
* Minecraft? Really? Minecraft is almost on every device that I own, which blows my mind, since the best version is still on the PC. I get that Mojang wants to reach as wide as an audience as possible and supporting the Ouya makes sense, but I am tired of Minecraft. I want to see some Real Titles on this machine. I want to see actual games running on it. Show me something that is exciting, not just words, renders, and pipe dreams.
* 100 USD for this piece of hardware is scary cheap. It seems far too cheap. Something seems weird about it all. I am all for affordable hardware, but I just don't quite understand how a controller and hardware with that specs can be profitable at ~100 USD.
* The Kickstarter claims to be shooting for a March 2013 release of the console. That seems really, really close. It does not seem like there is enough time to properly market it, further develop it post-Kickstarter, test it, manufacturer it, and get it to market by March 2013. I honestly expect this to be released Holiday 2013, as that seems far more realistic.

To me, this seems like it appeals to Developers far more than Players. It's important to help support Developers as they are the ones who will make or break the platform, but I fear that there is no real reason to develop for this. As a developer, I would love to have my games be played on the TV. It's a totally different feeling and mindset when playing on the TV versus a phone or computer.

However, as I listed above, there are some really big problems with this project. I think with the money raised from Kickstarter and the time put into this project, that it is setup to succeed on some level. I can only hope it does.

From the Player side of me, what does this offer over the PS3 or Xbox 360? Without the support of larger developers, not just indie developers, I am unsure about how far this will go and who will actually support it.

I think Ouya has a lot of potential, and I hope it succeeds because the video game landscape badly needs something that isn't bound to the big three, Steam, or iOS. I am trying my best to be realistic about it, as a lot of people aren't. Once the smoke settles, the money is exchanged, and the projects progresess, we will really see what the Ouya is, does, and can be.",,False,,t5_2sgq6,1342110189.0,,,True,t3_wfe7r,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/wfe7r/i_wrote_about_the_problems_i_honestly_feel_that/,

1334890606.0,105,self.truegaming,siznr,Just beat Half Life 1 for the first time. Here are my thoughts.,CellieBellie,176,71,145,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/siznr/just_beat_half_life_1_for_the_first_time_here_are/,"So I just finished playing Half Life 1 for the first time ever. Let me answer questions on why I just played this now or why I'm posting here preemptively. I'm 23 years old now and growing up I played console games almost exclusively. I played some PC games here and there but they were more on the lines of Torrin's Passage, King's Quest, Warcraft I, etc. I mostly just played PC games that my friends gave me/let me borrow and I hadn't really heard much about Half Life until the Orange Box came out a couple years ago. I'm posting this here because this is a really nice subreddit to discuss games in a more detailed and dare I say sophisticated manner. And now on to the game:

**First impressions**

Surprisingly, I could tell that the game was pretty far ahead of most other games at that time. Similar to driving an older super car, you can tell that when it came out it was quite a bit ahead of everything else then. The graphics were a bit choppy, there was a lot of screen tearing, artifacting, etc but the aesthetics were amazing. There's a great range of gun types and the controls/UI are clean, simple and very efficient. What was very annoying and took a long time to get used to was the running. It was like running on ice and very annoying (my friend said that that was how all FPS games were at the time).

**Gameplay Stuff**

Headcrabs are pretty annoying, but to be honest, what I found the strongest enemies were the soldiers. Before you get the crossbow (and even after depending on the angles you get) it's really hard to kill more than two soldiers unless you stealth around. They can take multiple shotgun shots, crazy amount of pistol shots, etc. Even the grunts later in the game weren't as annoying as soldiers early on. The turret weapon UI wasn't that good either. If it just centered you or something, that'd be good, but sometimes you'd be shooting from almost across the screen and it was kinda annoying.

**Story Stuff**

I'm really on the fence about this. I've found that one can think of the story in two ways:

1) You have no idea what's going on. You take a full first person position Gordon Freeman, you never learn anything outside of what Gordon learns. It is a very strict narrative (if I'm using that term correctly D: ). You're a physicist doing an experiment and shit goes wrong. You never really find out why it went wrong or what actually happened, so you just experience a confusing, mysterious adventure just trying to survive/escape the facility. You don't even learn that much more at the very end of the game.

2) The story doesn't tell you anything. You're the player, playing a game/story but nothing develops. You don't know why/what you're doing what you're doing, and doing it out of some compulsive need to advance.

At first I was leaning toward option 2 for the story, but after thinking about it for a while, I decided to go with scenario 1 for the story. That is, I played as Gordon and was just as confused as he, presumably, was. 

The other scientists trying to explain stuff to you was a nice way to try and fill the player in, but usually it was just a ""do this to progress"" kinda thing. 

**After-Thoughts**

I feel like the desire to play Half Life 2 really drove me to finish this game, at least at first. The first half of the game was very long and pretty repetitive. Although that kind of makes sense (since they're in a giant underground lab), it also made the first half of the game feel very grindy (for lack of a better term). I just felt that I had to power through the game in order to play Half Life 2 and that drove me to get to the second half. The second half of the game, I found to be much more fun. On a personal note, I don't like underground and/or water levels in most games, so it was really nice to hit the surface and then the other dimensions. Once you start getting near the surface was when the game started to get really exciting. You start praying that you hit the surface and learn what happened or everything works out, but it doesn't and it just makes for a more interesting latter half. I'm still a bit upset since nothing was really explained, I don't know who the hell that guy was at the end (although I do remember seeing him in a few other parts of the game), or what the hell the last boss was. 

Looking back on my 15 hours of play time (not sure if that's too short/long/just right), I had a lot of fun. I really enjoyed a game that came out years ago, and now realize why people love the game the way they do. I can also tell that these are definitely the same guys who made Portal. In fact the games play very similarly. Scientist protagonist doing some experiments, shit goes wrong, solve stuff and beat the boss. Even Portal played similarly 
in that the first game doesn't explain much but the second game answers a massive amount of questions, hopefully Half Life 2 does the same.

Don't be an ass and downvote anyone who steps forward admitting to any of this.

Bumping into a cheater or greifer in a multiplayer game is a very frustrating thing and as a 100% legit player, it is difficult for me to fathom how anyone could get enjoyment from doing it. I don't expect many people to step forward but if any do, I promise this isn't about flaming you. I'd just like to ask some questions. 

I cheated for a VERY breif time many years ago when Counter-Strike was young. I had some sort of an Ice hack that basically gave me x-ray vision. I had an Aimbot as well. After a few hours I was amazed to find out how god damn horrible I felt and I was also terrified of being banned since HalfLife was my life back then. Since then, whenever I see a hacker in a game I always wonder what kind of person can stand to do that for any period of time. I always wondered what goes on in their head, how they justify it, why they do it, etc. So i'll lay out some questions that any hacker or cheater is welcome to answer. Some questions, there's no way to not sound like an asshole. I assure you i'm just curious and not trying to witch hunt.

* 1) What made you decide to start cheating? 

* 2) Do you consider yourself a good player? (do you feel as if you actually won the game when you come out on top?)

* 3) How do you feel about ruining the experience of the game for others?

* 4) What sort of obstacles do you have to get through in order to cheat but not get banned?

* 5) Assuming you're no stranger to cheating in multiple games, what are some of the absolute worst games to play in regards to the number of cheaters?

* 6) What is your stance on exploits? Some argue they aren't cheats since it's faulty game design that everyone can take advantage of.

* 7) Would you consider cheating something of an addiction? Is it difficult to go back to playing legit after being godlike?

That's all for now. I don't want to ask too much. If anyone would like to answer these I'd greatly appreciate it. I don't intend to spread hate about any of this and will gladly upvote anyone who takes the time to answer a few of those questions honestly.

Thanks.

1362314028.0,102,self.truegaming,19kogd,Discussion: can lore improve the ability of a game to teach its gameplay mechanics?,Squidamus,146,44,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/19kogd/discussion_can_lore_improve_the_ability_of_a_game/,"I had been wanting to jump into Dota2 for a while but found the learning curve difficult to fit in with my busy schedule, but when the first tutorial came out I decided to try the game properly.

One of the things I found frustrating was the game's reluctance to explain mechanics that I later read were quite important during real PVP; in particular, Last Hitting. In the Dev Forum I provided feedback explaining that a possible reason for this reluctance is the lack of an intuitive or relatable connection between the game's lore and mechanics.

I explain this in this feedback post [providing vital direction in an open-ended game through lore](http://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=76637&amp;p=495512#post495512) and is as follows:

&gt;In Dota2 there are so many options, characters, items, and things to learn, that it quickly becomes very overwhelming for new players starting to play the game. A very key issue in Dota2 that makes it difficult for a beginner to transition to comfortable online play is that there are far too many gameplay techniques that are assumed from player, but never specifically stated. a key example of this is last hitting. The tutorial mentions that a character only receives gold for last hits, but it does not adequately explain HOW to do this. It is difficult for a new player to adjust their playstyle if they do not know what they are doing wrong. It wasn't until I read online later that players should avoid (auto)hitting creeps until they are in low health, and THEN attack them (among other tips, such as animation length etc). This seemed strange and unintuitive, and isn't explained to the player very well...

&gt;at first I thought 'last hitting' was just an outdated game mechanic but as I read further I realised it was an important element that adds to the metagame of competing for last hits against opponents. A possible explanation for this issue then, is that there is a disconnect between the Dota2 metagameplay, and the ability for Dota2 to provide a believable/relatable fantasy setting, ie. how does the Dota2 fantasy lore explain why a player would receive gold for last hitting a creep? it doesn't. in fact it simply goes against intuitive logic to not effectively contribute to the demise of an enemy until the last second, but makes for a great gameplay mechanic, and so it isn't addressed. Unfortunately, this contradiction of gameplay and lore highlights a reluctance for the game to explicitly articulate and explain certain gameplay mechanics. This leads to an overall detrimental experience for new players, wherein there is a gap between the gameplay elements explained in the confines of the game's lore, and that of the deep metagame that must be searched for externally to the game. In the end, we have an incongruent experience for new players, that must at some point utilise a variety of disparate resources and/or often dedicate a significant amount of unnecessary time, simply in order to become competent and 'break-even' to a level of capability that allows for comfortable enjoyment of the game.

&gt;This issue is endemic to Dota2, where there is an abundance of metagame mechanics that go unexplained, and an abundance of potential options that leave new players overwhelmed. What if gold was an award from the gods, given to heroes who break the spirits of opposing enemy organisms in this world? Would this enable the ideal environment for the explanation of an otherwise assumed or even hidden mechanic? Ideally, I would like to see Dota2 explain many of these 'unspoken rules' without restraint - such as the distribution of exp, or denying of creeps - and I think this can be done simply through the expansion of the game's lore and it's subsequently understood integration into the game's mechanics. For now however, the idea of utilising tutorial quests as a method to teach players gameplay mechanics, is a fantastic first step in the right direction towards shortening the unruly learning curve of Dota2.

what do you think? are there games where you feel the game is struggling or not trying to communicate key elements? to what extent should a player merely explore the mechanics and draw their own conclusions, and when might this simply be unreasonable?

------------------
**UPDATE**

You know what, many of you are completely right, Dota2 was quite likely a poor example, and although Valve has seemingly added some background to the characters; an overarching story to a competitive title such as Dota2 is likely a silly premise.

I guess what I had really wanted to bring attention to was a way for certain games easily to 'break the fourth wall' and inform you of important/common gameplay elements that should be 'exploited'. while i agree that in most cases minor tactics are best just figured out by the player, there are sometimes common gameplay elements that are missed by inexperienced players. in many instances they're not easily able to discern a game's confines or opportunities, and can be led significantly astray. If not narrative, then perhaps some kind of visible link that allows the player to relate to the *possibility* of a mechanic seems fair. even a short visible example of a hero waiting until a creep was on low health to last hit would suffice, so one could at least know that it was a viable thing to do.

An instance that comes to mind is a time when I was playing CS1.6 against a friend and I would occasionally be killed from a ridiculous distance. turns out he knew of certain walls he could shoot through and occasionally got lucky. I had never entertained the notion that doing that would even be possible.
Even in Minecraft, it still seems silly that I need to learn about how to craft things *outside of the game* to be able to play it properly.

It reminds me of when I realized that the spherical shapes in Super Mario 64 were just 2D sprites. I'm currently making a game that can best be described as game version of the film, Fright Night. It takes place in one, rainy night. Little things like realizing that I need to set the game up to not rain indoors just gives me respect for gamemakers that work on a larger scale. Other things:

Setting up environments are a pain. Even in a 2D, casual game maker. You have to think about what the people living in the space would have even if no one will ever notice.

Difficulty takes a lot of work. My game is just a series of boss battles in a Dragon Quest style RPG. I'm having to make the battles not impossible if you don't have all the optional weapons and armor, but not too easy if you do.

It's strange putting a number on everyday objects. How many HP will you get from eating beef jerky? What side effects will you get from drinking coffee? +5 Stamina? You have to represent everything in a numerical value. 

You have to pay attention to random physical things. Your character will just stand above shadows if you didn't plan ahead. In playtesting, I've walked through walls, got stuck in grass, and had lighting effects look pitch black.

A side note. I'm thinking of having a ""greedy"" character only die when you steal all their money. I wonder if that is not intuitive enough for a player to figure out.

It's just that game design is deeper than I thought it was before I started working on my hobby game. Anybody have any experiences with working in gaming?

I know this topic has been broached before, but I'd like to provide some fresh insight. JRPGs simply aren't cutting it any more.",maverickrenegade,193,88,224,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/rl159/i_havent_completed_a_single_jrpg_that_has_come/,"This is an opinion piece and is completely speculative. It is not a scholarly article either, I just threw it together in my free time about a year ago and updated it with some more modern games. The funny thing is, although I put this together about a year ago it is far more relevant now than it was before. With that being said feel free to tear me a new one if necessary.

----

A demo I received from the Playstation Underground (remember that?) many years ago threw me headlong into my first ""3D"" JRPG experience. That demo was Final Fantasy VII. It is no secret that Square had something great on their hands with FFVII. It helped pave the way for 3D console RPGs and truly set the bar in terms of quality. After the introduction of the 3D genre; JRPGs became the pinnacle of storytelling, character development, sense of spectacle, and implementing the suspension of disbelief. They absorbed players into their fantasies and allowed them to freely utilize their imaginations. Unfortunately, with this current generation of consoles and gamers, these same defining characteristics are also proving to be their downfall. With that being said, this is where I begin to tear down the genre I so dearly love.

I'm just going to come out and say it; JRPGs have become practically intolerable for me to play through. I can't think of a JRPG (aside from Xenoblade Chronicles, but that still suffers from a few glaring issues) in this current console generation that displays or invokes the quality that defined the previous console generations. I strongly believe that this stems from an unwillingness to change certain conventions and traits of the JRPG formula.

First of all, recycled plot lines and unoriginal characters are murdering JRPGs. I can think of an innumerable amount of games that use the same formula; ""Angst filled teenagers save the world."" Think about it; that is literally the central theme of every major JRPG out there. Is it too much to ask for some adults or even some adult themes or situations? Final Fantasy XIII just so happens to be the latest culprit associated with this plot cliche'. A prime example of doing things correctly is James Cameron's Avatar. Despite a plot that has been done in perhaps hundreds of other movies, books and games it was still able to keep the viewer engaged and left a lasting impression. This was due to the masterful directing, set pieces, writing and the viewer’s emotional involvement or ability to empathize with the plight of the characters.

Many of these JRPGs can get some, but not all of these characteristics to mesh well. If improprerly executed this causes detachment in the overall enjoyment of the game. I'll use FFXIII as an example. The directing and set pieces are practically breathtaking, but the characters and writing are totally convoluted and ridiculous. This destroys the suspension of disbelief and any immersion that may come with it. This also consequently removes the ability of the player to empathize and relate with the characters in the game as well.

Over time, voice acting and dialogue have not stood up to quality control either. Great voice actors are easy to come by, but it seems JRPGs challenge themselves to stay as far away from these talented individuals as possible. Take the game ""Chaos Wars;"" it has some of the worst voice acting you may ever hear.  Although scores of translators do an excellent job of localizing the dialogue for non Japanese speaking gamers this doesn't mean that the dialog is ""good.""
 
[Chaos Wars: Worst Voice Actors Ever](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAtC1SzWSXg)

""Be forewarned before clicking this video or the one below, if your ears begin to bleed pause the video immediately. I assume no responsibility if you decide to stab your eardrums in a fit of audio rage. I liken the way these voice actors sound to the way a cat may sound when its tail gets caught in an automatic can opener.""

[50 Worst Video Game Lines](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulbotKa5LnM&amp;feature=related)

It seems to be a trend in anime, Japanese movies and games to inject misplaced comedy in dramatic scenes and situations. This is more than likely a cultural trait, but for others this causes a major rupture in the enjoyment of the medium. Using FFXIII as an example once more, during the first 20 minutes of the game it committed this faux pa twice. During a battle sequence where people were literally being gunned down a young character was complaining about having to fight and save lives. Then, a joke was made about taking a nap in the battlefield. It's annoying and completely destroys any immersion that was previously built. This isn't an example exclusive to FFXIII which I have picked on quite a bit, it's something prevalent in most, if not all JRPGs I have come across in recent memory. It just so happens that FFXIII or XIII-2 is the most relevant and recent case.

The inconsistent conveyance of emotion between characters in romantic situations, particularly in realistic games like Heavy Rain (I realize it isn't a JRPG) or FFXIII, can make games awkward and uncomfortable to watch as well. The more realistic the game the closer it comes to the uncanny valley. Scenes between a male and female character that are supposed to convey affection become extremely awkward and uncomfortable to watch. Secretly, it may make you think ""I really hope no one is watching what I am playing right now."" Feelings of embarrassment or disgust for some may result.

When these are presented by themselves they can be worked around without too much issue. However, these trends are present in almost every JRPG this generation, affecting even otherwise good games like Tales of Vesperia, Lost Odyssey, Valkyria Chronicles or more recently Xenoblade Chronicles. It is obvious that Japanese game makers heed the cries from their fans because they are constantly improving traditional gameplay mechanics and at the very least I can say that FFXIII/XIII-2 had an excellent and inventive battle system, but they are completely overlooking the simple yet extremely important facets that define the quality of their games.

Major changes need to be made in these fields before JRPGs can once again be embraced by audiences outside of Japan. If not, I am afraid that the genre will soon be a dying breed left to stagnate on the shelves of the die-hards only. For now, I will rally my support behind companies like Atlus, NIS and Level 5 who consistently look to challenge the conventions of JRPG’s and game culture as a whole.

Edit: I find it funny that many of the popular comments are saying that I hate JRPGS. This is COMPLETELY to the contrary, in fact, they are my favorite genre and this is why it bothers me so much that JRPGS have failed to evolve as far as some other genres have this console generation. Final Fantasy VII is the game that got me REALLY into JRPGs, but I can pride myself in saying that I have literally played hundreds since then. Name a JRPG since the NES and I have probably spent some time with it.

Many of you also said in different words that this is a WRPG circlejerk which it isn't as well. Did anyone actually read what I wrote? This is all opinion and observations that I've made and are in no way reflective of the ENTIRE genre. WRPGS aren't perfect just like JRPGs aren't, but it's tough to deny that many WRPGS have progressed significantly farther this generation than JRPGs have. Most of them have better narratives, characters, plot points and in many cases better gameplay too. That doesn't mean they don't share problems either. Many of them suffer from the same tired cliche's that you'll find everywhere. 

The videos included are extreme examples to my points and I am fully aware that they are extreme. I included them for the humor more than anything. 

The only thing I have left to say is... relax. This is just my opinion and observations that I have made. No need to get your panties in a bunch. Take it in stride and provide counter points to what I said. There's no need for snide and condescending comments like saying ""As an *ACTUAL* fan of JRPGs... blah blah.""

Couple of things that need to be broadcast for all.

* The sidebar has been updated, now with rules! These are likely to have some tweaking adjustments made, so check them occasionally.

* The outline of the subreddit has changed. Not by much, by to make it a little more directed than the original which was just a clone.

* A new header image has been put up. Hope you like it.

* I will be hitting the moderation hard over the next couple of months. I'm noticing a rise in the amount of comments which are just pointless.

**However, when relevant and possible I will place a public comment giving my reasons for doing so, for transparency.**

I want this subreddit to be the best it can be, and I believe the clearest way for that to happen is if I can be truthful to you guys. That way, if there is a vote of no-confidence against me at any stage, it's all in the public forum for full disclosure.

Some of these deletions will happen without notice. Don't take it personally, but I think the subreddit needs better support from me than it is getting.

And to put it now and clear: at any time someone can call for a vote of no-confidence against me, to be determined by the subreddit whether or not I stay. If enough users want me gone, I will happily move aside. I've seen too many subs ruined and users burned because they don't want to lose power, are too stubborn or stupid to know that their time is done. You can keep everyone happy all of the time, but if it's time for me to move on I can accept that. Until that stage though, I am happy to work to better the community.

Once again, please give any feedback and ideas down below if you think there is something that may improve the subreddit.

Strength - The success factors in games",Phlexonance,139,34,124,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/udylh/avatar_strength_luck_and_player_strength_the/,"What I would most want out of a game review is a breakdown of the game's success factors in the three categories Avatar Strength, Luck and Player Strength.

*Definitions:*

* A success factor is what determines whether you succeed in the game. Games' success factors rarely fall 100% into one category; the continuum *could* be visualized as a triangle, but I believe numbers and graphs can't be objectively made from just one reviewer and aren't necessary. It would be enough to discuss those three factors during the review and point them out in the gameplay.

* Avatar Strength, (more precisely Persistent Avatar Strength), is the mathemacical superiority of your avatar over other avatars or NPCs (e.g. equip in RPGs, weapon/unit unlocks etc.).    
The persistence is important, as mathematical advantage which you have to acquire each match/fight (i.e. non-persistent) falls into the categories of Luck and/or Player strength.   
 (e.g. persistent: gear in WoW or D3; non-persistent: gear in DotA).

* Luck is where an advantage is given by random chance (e.g. lottery, mario party, poker etc.)

* Player Strength (or Player Skill), the ability of the human player, such as decision making, memory, reaction, hand-eye-coordination, stress resistance  etc.

*Why the distinction is important to me (and I hope it might be to other people as well):*

**The different success factors address different tastes.**   

Here the example of mine:

I view games that rely overwhelmingly on Avatar Strength as timesinks, since it only matters who has played more (e.g. WoW, D3, KoA etc.).

Games that have a large luck factor annoy me, since I don't feel in control anymore.

I can tolerate a little bit of both factors, if player strength takes the lion's share.

So let's say I've seen some gameplay footage and marketing blah blah of a new game and it appears to me that there is little to no luck factor and ~ 30/70 avatar/player strength. After reading the review I realize it's actually more like 20/70/10 luck/avatar/player and I don't waste my money and time.

**It doesn't matter whether the game is well made and has a good story, if the distribution of success factors don't match my taste, I'll find the gameplay unfulfilling.**

That's all. Please tell me whether you agree that the success factors matching the player's taste are most important in whether a player enjoys the game, topping (or maybe being the foundation of) all positive reinforcements loops and other skinnerbox elements.

I don't mean straighforward plot twists or epic moments; these are pretty old and common devices across many forms of media today. I'm looking for subversive events and tropes that are a direct result of the structure of the game, and wouldn't work anywhere else.

Such moments often arise from toying with the link between the player and the entity they control in the game. My favorite holy-shit moment to date occurred when playing Andrew Plotkin's [Spider and Web](http://www.wurb.com/if/game/207). On the surface, the game is a frame narrative with the player being interrogated in a cell. If you're sufficiently genre savvy, you can tell unreliable narration is at play here. The genius of it is that *you* are the narrator, and you're never sure if you're fibbing. This makes you a *very* good liar (the best possible kind), and you're constantly double guessing yourself. When the payoff hits, it blows your mind because you engineered it yourself; I had to stop playing for a while. Don't want to spoil it here.

Contrast this with the fairly well done plot twist in KOTOR: It felt great because it was a revelation about *your* player character, but it wasn't fundamentally different from a revelation about the protagonist of a novel, and probably doesn't qualify here. Feel free to disagree.

Another minor example is at the end of Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood when you ostensibly control Desmond, but any action you take results in him [inching closer towards knifing his friend](/spoiler). It restricts your agency in a non-frustrating manner leading to a inevitable climax where the player's and Desmond's helplessness are perfectly mirrored.

[There are other sound chips out there, capable of producing sounds we gamers haven't heard for over a decade.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eh2PXPZNEMs) Graphically, I suppose it's harder to put into words. Pixel was able to make a game clearly meant to look like an NES game, while doing things an NES game could never do. I think he understood how to create the illusion, though.  What I'd like is for more Pixels to step up, to set the trend and create a template for how to make a new, SNES-retro style game, or Genesis-retro, or whatever.

blaming publishers entirely?",icyflakes,169,67,140,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/qsn8x/why_do_we_continue_to_scapegoat_developers_by/,"A few years ago it was blaming Activision for everything bad or greedy Blizzard did, and these days its blaming EA for everything bad Bioware or DICE do. Now, we always hear these stories of small devs getting bought out and shafted by the big publishers, but I think we tend to forget that developers do also have some pull in decision making.

Let's take Bioware for example. They are fast becoming the major source of revenue for EA and I believe we're past the point where we can believe that the general consensus at Bioware is that the DLC is wrong but they can't do anything about it because they are imprisoned by EA. They wouldn't come out and defend their decisions so vehemently if it wasn't what they wanted.

You look at SWTOR and you see a Bioware that's listening to the community intently and working hard to appease them, because they care about subscriptions after the first month. The Mass Effect team have come out and told consumers they don't know what they are talking about because they don't need the customers to like them after the initial purchase.

If the publishers were such pricks, then surely the Day 1 DLC that has come out for both the Dragon Age and Mass Effect series would have transferred over to Battlefield 3? Why aren't DICE being poisoned by the cancer of DLC, and instead pushing out quality DLC intended to expand the lifespan of a game? 

Now, for the record, I think Bioware and DICE are both terribly greedy developers (I hate what DICE turned the Battlefield series into), but I don't think thats anything more than developers seeing a lot more money that comes with the success of IPs. 

I do understand that many would argue that cultures can be created when the publishers put their own men into positions of power in these companies, but I still feel it just isn't all the publishers fault.

1316329544.0,107,self.truegaming,kjcsw,Why does storytelling in most games suffer so much? Dead Island reviewed and discussed as an example. (Very long),HaloShy,120,13,77,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/kjcsw/why_does_storytelling_in_most_games_suffer_so/,"After recently finishing Dead Island with a friend, I looked back over the entire game and was very disappointed. I had just played a good game that could have easily been great--maybe even a classic--if the game's storytelling and writing had not been ignored. This wasn't a case of poor writing or a poor story being told, or even a rushed experience. It's very clear that the development of this game decided that the writing and story was not important.

Dead Island seems to have gotten a bad reputation due to its bad launch. I have seen people who haven't even played the game judge it as a buggy mess just because of that first error. For those who may have missed the initial days of the game, an early development version was sent to Steam and was distributed as a release. This mistake was not fixed for about 24 hours, and it was followed up by strained servers and people unable to connect online to play the game cooperatively. Since then the game has ran very smoothly. I played the entire game online with a friend and did not encounter a single bug or crash in the 40+ hours it took us the complete it. We were quite thorough and didn't miss many, if any, sidequests. Despite the difficult launch, the game was put together quite well.

Visually, the game is put together to the same standard. The worst parts of the game's graphics are the human characters and certain bad textures and draw distance issues. Even these were mostly passable. Everything else looks fantastic. The game has been criticized for excessive bloom effects but I thought they fit with the resort island and jungle setting. The environments look realistically ransacked, trashed, and chaotic. A lot of care has obviously been put into making them a believable setting after a zombie outbreak reaches critical mass. The zombies themselves look amazing, with a lot of variation in decomposition, missing tissue, body parts, injuries, fire damage, and all sorts of other fun stuff. Each of the game's four acts also offers a new, distinct setting to explore. Each one is drastically different from the last but still has the same attention to detail given to make them the same high quality.

Lastly, the gameplay is solid. I think a lot of people were expecting something else out of the game and may have been spoiled by those unmet expectations. I went in with very few preconceptions and was very pleased. The focus on melee weapons makes a lot of sense and works very well. Hitting a zombie feels right, with enough feedback and response to make it feel satisfying and give you the impression that you actually landed a blow. Again, the attention to detail here is commendable: you can tear zombie tissue with bladed weapons, chop off limbs at different points so each time you hack off an appendage it doesn't always look the same. Blunt weapons can shatter bones and render limbs unusable, or be used to knock zombies over. This is actually a necessary tactic to win some fights against larger groups or special infected. 

The game has a Diablo-esque loot system with randomly spawned items from chests and enemies with varying levels of quality. Modding your weapons using scrounged up materials is surprisingly fun and adds new abilities and visual additions to your weapons. They look fun, are effective, and keep with the ""home-made"" style of the modification system. Exploration is rewarded and I was surprised to find that there were hidden secrets and locations around the game that offered secret mods, collectables, and special weapons.

This was not meant to be a review of the game itself even though it may read like one so far. Whether you agree or disagree with my assessment above it should be at least plain that thought went into these decisions by the developers. Even if you did not enjoy a lot of the design decisions you can at the very least see that they had an idea that they worked toward and a concept that they pursued. The same cannot be said for the storytelling and writing. 

There are next to zero moments in the game that redeem this shortcoming. This is not a problem that is limited to Dead Island but rather many games in general. It's not as if this game tried to tell a story and failed, it's that it strung together the barest scraps of story together necessary to push the game forward and then ignored it. The story doesn't make sense, it doesn't try to make sense, the game doesn't care that it doesn't make sense, and it's brought out at odd places and reluctantly spouts something at you to keep you playing as if the developers hated every minute of time they had to devote to it.

The story sequences are incoherent, illogical, badly presented and, at times, just make up new information on the spot as they go along. I would be surprised to find if a writer was even paid to produce the story sequences in this game. To clarify, the game wasn't trying for the ever elusive goal of ""so bad it's good"" or a b-movie parody. At points your characters are warped to different areas that aren't even connected on the map. They are just magically plopped down somewhere else with no narrative link. Some characters act on motives that have never been shown or explained, some act on events that don't even happen in the game or are just fabricated on the spot.

Examples (some spoilers, not that you should care, though): 

Very early on in the game you witness a plane crash over the island and it is heavily implied that it's due to the zombies. You find the wreckage later and explore it. There are zombies there, but also human enemies that are scavenging. Later in the story you find out that the zombie outbreak is limited to the island and there is even a military blockade surrounding it to keep it that way. Why did the plane crash?

You help survivors early on in the game and then leave them to head into the city to find them food and other supplies. They contact you at points over a ham radio and remind you of the people that need your help. They mention things are getting worse and that some people are getting infected. A girl that was sick is mentioned and the survivors kill her before she even turns because they're afraid. You can travel back at any time and nothing is different. No one says anything different. This girl never even existed. She's literally not in the game.

""The Voice"", a character introduced in the first moments of the game, guides you through the story and serves as the main motivation to progress. He offers you a way off the island, but you have to help him. It is heavily foreshadowed that he is lying to you and using you to his own ends, that he is fabricating the story about his infected wife that you need to find a vaccine for before he will get you off the island. At the end of the game you meet him after you have obtained the vaccine, and he was never lying at all. The wife is real, he was who he said he was, he did have a way off the island, then he inexplicably betrays you anyway and becomes the end boss. He is bitten by his wife near the end, administers the vaccine on himself, which then transforms him into a huge zombie monster and you kill him. You take his helicopter, which a helpful prison inmate somehow knows how to fly perfectly, and you leave everyone on the island to rot. The end.

I can offer more examples about vanishing characters, storylines that just stop and go nowhere, and things that make no sense. Seriously, I am only limiting it to these three because this post is already too damn long. If you want more, ask below. I could do this all day.

One redeemable story were the recordings left by a journalist scattered around the island. These were the only things in the game that were well-written, had very high quality voice acting (Cam Clarke, I believe), and acted as a stark contrast to how bad the rest of the story and writing was. I cared about the story of that guy more than every single other character combined.

This was not a rushed game. The quality of it in other areas proves that. I think a qualified writer could have patched up these issues with very little time, and a few more of them could have shaped the game into something that was outstanding. Do people not care? Do developers not care? Are writers prohibitively expensive?

Hi everyone.

Since 250(!) people have shown up in the past two days thanks to some word-of-mouth support, I think it's time I spoke to you about what truegaming is, and what you'd like it to be.  I've spoken about this elsewhere, so if I'm repeating myself, I apologise, but feel free to reiterate any ideas you might have in this thread.

I used to get frustrated with r/gaming.  There wasn't enough of 'my' kind of content.  I watched threads come and go where people would complain about the state of the subreddit, and the same answers would crop up every time: hide it and move on, create a seperate subreddit for the current hot topic, install RES to filter out undesirable content, community needs to downvote more, stop complaining because it's not helping etc.  It grew tiresome, and no-one came away satisfied.

These threads existed because r/gaming had become enormous.  Almost 500,000 users, and with great size comes great karma.  500,000 potential voters on your content.  Inevitably, people latch on to trends to secure greater amounts of karma.  This would lead to constant spikes in content based on the preferences of the average r/gaming user.  When groups are smaller, the average individual has a wider range of tastes.  When you reach half a million, it's practically a cultural force.  The cultural force of r/gaming was essentially a PC proponent who loves Valve, despises CoD and has a deep fondness for SNES-era RPGs, Pokémon and Zelda, all of which was best expressed in image macros.  As the number of people this cultural template fit increased, so did the number of people discontent with the way their experience of r/gaming was changing.

There was no real solution to this problem.  There's no way that you could possibly control 500,000 people in pursuit of a virtual currency that can best be obtained en masse by appealing to the most generic preferences of the average user.  Suggestions were made to create alternative subreddits for whatever was popular at the time.  Sometimes this works, if the fanbase for that topic cares enough about it to ignore karma in favour of simply enjoying it, hence successful subreddits for Starcraft and Minecraft.
Most of the time, however, it was less successful.  Attempts to create places for things like pictures didn't stop the flooding of pictures, because the only reason those pictures exist is to gain karma, and there is no karma in fledgling subreddits.  The best that might be hoped for is a brief interest in the alternative, before people start using r/gaming again for the posting of content.

What to do?  It seemed like the best solution was, instead of telling people to create their own subreddit for one type of content, to accept that this is what the now 560,000-strong community wants, and create a subreddit that encompassed ""everything else"".  So, as an experiment, I created r/truegaming.

It was my hope that, whenever someone felt compelled to complain about flooding of pics/Valve/Morrowind/whatever, they would simply be redirected by the community to r/truegaming.  It's meant to be r/gaming, but without the opportunity for karma, so people get to talk about things without being buried under content that only exists to gain karma.  This is achieved by disabling links: if you want to talk about something that absolutely requires a reference, it can be put in the self post and hopefully the users will read it.  Also, we're currently insignificant in size, so even comment karma is pretty scarce.  Hopefully, the lack of link karma should keep the subreddit from getting too big.

As for the name: I've seen some concern that the name 'truegaming' is meant to be a dig at r/gaming, a way to assert ourselves as the 'true gamers'.  Not so.  I don't identify myself as a 'gamer', just someone who's played games for 20 years and has a fondness for talking about them.  The name is meant as a reference to truereddit, which sees itself as a Reddiquette-based version of reddit.com that frowns on karma-farming.  I had hoped that the name 'truegaming' would communicate all of that succintly, not to separate people or identify ourselves with some ideal of what a gamer should or should not be like.  I'll reiterate: truegaming is **not** in competition with gaming.  It is a companion subreddit to take the load off the default by providing a place for people to talk about games outside of the current/recurring trends.

Now, this place has had a spike in traffic, thanks to the efforts of IdiotequeDance and LeadLunchbox, and it's time for it to go from 'empty room with an idea attached' to 'actual subreddit that provides content', and for it to do that, we need to talk about what you want from the subreddit.

It has a lot of very interesting looking games early on, and it was going to be the first console I ever got at launch. But as the time gets closer, I feel less and less like I should.

For starters there is the cost. We don't know how much the next gen consoles will be (not counting the Wii U) and coupled with that is not knowing the cost of the *games*.  In NZ most games launch at around $100-$120, depending on the edition of the game etc (most collectors editions go beyond that), and everywhere currently has next gen games starting at $120-$130. Gaming can already be a pretty expensive pass time, so to make it even more expensive would price it out of reach for many.

Second, it seems like no one even wants us to make the leap to next gen at launch. With games such as 
GTA5, MGSV, Last of Us, Destiny, Watch Dogs, Assassins Creed 4, Arkham Origins, Dust 514, COD: Ghosts, Lords of Shadow 2, Beyond: Two Souls, Splinter Cell, Remember Me, Metro: Last Light, Stick of Truth, Dark Souls 2, Saints Row 4, Rainbow 6: Patriots, and more coming to current consoles, why would we want to upgrade?

Yes many of these games are coming to next gen, but they wont offer anything more than perhaps a nicer coat of paint. Really the only thing that has my interest so far is inFAMOUS: Second Son. And I can keep myself busy for a year or two and pick it up later.

Do not get me wrong, I understand that this game mechanic is there to help me to use a wide and diverse selection of weapons, but I've found it to be unrealistic to the point that it breaks my concentration from the game. 

While I don't mind a chair or bar stool breaking into pieces after being broken over a few heads, I find the fact that a broadsword or crowbar breaks completely after around 50 zombie kills to be rather unrealistic.

I have heard, albeit not played, that System Shock 2 had horrible weapon degradation and that handguns would expire far too quickly. As somewhat of a gun nut, I can attest that no in service pistol would fail after 100 rounds.

As for a game that I feel does weapon degradation well, both Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas both feel like weapons are degrading linearly, and realistically.

So I am asking your opinions, is weapon degradation a good gameplay mechanic for balancing power and longevity as well as adding a potential fear factor in suspenseful games, or do you feel that the weapons breaking prematurely is simply a gameplay crutch that detracts from the immersion?

1341083988.0,99,self.truegaming,vunui,Setting vs Story,Tiako,130,31,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/vunui/setting_vs_story/,"This is something I think a lot of reviewers and even some developers get wrong. Most of the time, games will be praised for having a great story, or damned for having a boring, cliched story. However, I believe what they should actually be talking about is *setting*, and that most games that are praised for deep, rich stories actually have well realized settings. I'll get to the importance of this distinction at the end.

I can't really provide ""proof"" of my assertion, more just a demonstration. To do this, compare the reviews of a game with a strong plot and a boring setting to a game with a rote plot and a good setting. The best example I can think of for the former is the first Splinter Cell, which had a pretty good Tom Clancy style Spec Ops plot. It is complex, there are twists and turns and it all comes together fairly well. But that is generally all you hear about it: Splinter Cell is praised for its graphics and simple, intuitive stealth action, not for its story. Far Cry is another example. The plot is a pretty well done riff on Dr. Moreau, and does a pretty good job of pacing and what you can call ""plot escalation."" But all the reviews focused on graphics and gameplay, and the plot was easily dismissed.

I will give two examples of the latter, because both show their setting in different ways. One is the Half Life series. It is frequently praised for its story, but in realty the story is not really any different than Doom. Scientists open portal, all Hell/Xen breaks loose, one person has to go through to close it. Add some tin foil hat nods with the government coverup, and you have a very basic, bare bones plot. Half Life 2 is much the same. I beat it again recently, and I still have trouble describing what, exactly, is happening plot wise because it is pretty much a pure chase plot: Run to the base, base gets attacked, run to the next base, etc. Another example is Dragon Age. The plot is possibly the most basic and cliched plot in all fantasy: Hero of destiny must unite the races to save the kingdom from the ultimate evil.

But the games mentioned in the second are often praised for their storylines, which they don't really have. I argue this is so because they build rich and detailed *settings*. Half Life does this through the interactions with the world and the characters--the best example is the opening sequence of Half Life and the way it portrayed all the ""technical difficulties"", particularly the one guard stuck outside. Dragon Age did this through sidequests, which gave a sense of a world that exists outside the main plot (political troubles among the dwarves, for example). It then added a truly astounding level of extraneous detail through the various books and scrolls lying around. Both created worlds that the player exist in, rather than worlds that exist for the player.

So why does this matter? One, game developers need to stop focusing on story, not in favor of gameplay (different discussion), but in favor of setting. Gears of War had a clearly thought out story that absolutely nobody cares about because the setting only exists for the purpose of killing aliens. Two, setting is not something conveyed through cut scenes. A developer can spend a fortune on getting beautifully rendered, well acted cut scenes, but nobody will care without a good setting. A setting is something best conveyed organically while a player is in control. And three, we need freedom, but more importantly, *pointless* freedom. The Diablo games give you a great deal of freedom to explore, but there is always a nice, shiny prize at the end. Why do you go down that tunnel? because you get the +12 Newbpwner Sword. Exploration is incentivized, and thus not true exploration. The tunnel holds no joy in and of itself, and is essentially just another part of the whatever-it-is Diablo is doing. In Skyrim, I climbed to the top of mountains because they were there, not because it was easy, but *because it was hard.* Assassin's Creed, as a sidenote, does a fantastic job of balancing these.

But most importantly, we, as consumers and reviewers, need to start distinguishing between the two. Plot is a nice add on, setting is vital.

Now, of course you would have carts and stuff to transport you between major locations, but if you want to go somewhere like a forgotten temple, you would have to traverse for a while before you finally get there, instead of walking off the road for 5 seconds and getting to a 'hidden' place full of treasure, even though people have walked past it for hundreds of years.

This would add some realism to games such as this. Why would many major towns be built within 15 minutes walk of each other? How come there are so many bandits, and other hostile creates, within quick walking distance of so many major towns? How come there are so many unique locations so close together? With a larger map, it would become more realistic.

I suppose I'm understating my frustration in the post title. The ending, in my opinion, sucked. It wasn't the fact that Cole died, it was everything else in addition to him dying. Cole's story was that of a good cop but a flawed man in a corrupt city. He rises to professional stardom, solves a few very high profile cases, and gets smacked down by his ""partner"" who's every bit as corrupt as anyone else. He languishes in Arson, continues to work as much as he can towards blowing the city open and exposing its corruption to the light, and even goes as far as getting a fellow war veteran involved to help (the relationship, by the way, could have been better fleshed out). Assistant DA gets involved, the Suburban Redevelopment Fund crumbles all around itself and then...

Cole dies. He dies heroically but he still dies. No followup from the corrupt police chief, no followup from the assistant DA. Roy Earle delivers a fake and hollow eulogy for his partner. No followup from the wife or kids that Cole cheated on other than them being at the funeral service. The church is woefully underattended, despite how much Cole helped the city.

While this ending could have been appropriate if you had done a poor job exposing cases, I think it was just weak. Rushed, even. The entire Arson desk buildup was just a freaking tease. Cole had a gun pointed squarely at Roy's head and frankly, he should have pulled the trigger (after Roy attempted to escape or bring Cole down or SOMETHING). Cole should have delivered the eulogy about ""Roy, the cop who did his job and did it well"".

I'm not complaining that Cole bit it at the end of the game (although I would have preferred a portryal of Phelps as a phoenix who rose from the ashes of disgrace). What I am complaining about is that the Vice Squad (Roy, specifically) and the Chief of Police got away scott free.

On foot, two players moving together will spend most of their time trudging across the map only to end up with one player killed immediately in an ambush; so effectively, when the combat finally comes, teammates die too quickly most of the time to really fight together.

Mainly because of this endless quick-death/respawn cycle, most team combat games devolve into teammates barely playing together in any real sense at all. My teammates and I aren't working together: we just happen to be trying to kill the same enemies.

**3. Action, action, action! Who needs time to think or coordinate?**

However long it takes one person to think, a group of even just two or three people seems to take ten times as long to do the same thinking. This is true even under ideal circumstances, let alone in a fast-paced action game with iffy text and voice communication.

Now this doesn't mean we can't have fast-action team play, but it does mean games should consciously allow for breaks in the action. Instead of 'action, action, action!', game design should always privilege 'pacing, pacing, pacing!'

**4. If one ball is fun, then ten balls must be ten times as fun.**

Looking at sports, focus is almost always very clearly focused on a single ball, and for good reason. Too many points of focus mean the team play quickly devolves to incoherence: everyone just ends up doing their own thing, defeating the whole idea of team play.

**5. If having ten players is fun, then having one hundred players must be ten times as fun.**

Similarly, past a certain number of players, team play becomes incoherent. Too many players means too many teammates to coordinate with and too many opponents to worry about. Again, looking at sports, we see that eleven or twelve players per team seems to be the upper limit. In fact, on the soccer field, half the players spend most of the time standing outside the zone of action waiting for the ball to get closer. So the sweet-spot seems to be about 3-6 players per side actively engaging each other around a local objective.

Notice I said ""local"" objective. Teams beyond the 11-12 player threshold can conceivably work coherently as long as strong mechanisms are in place to divide the team into smaller units, each engaging separate objectives. For example, a Battlefield-style game could work with 32-player teams or beyond if stronger mechanisms were in place to enforce squad-based play and if those squads were ensured to have separate objectives. The danger, though, is that too many squads off doing their own thing eventually becomes as incoherent as a game of too many individual teammates off doing their own thing.

**6. You can't make me play medic! I'll do what I want!**

For role-based gameplay (such as class-based and/or vehicle-based combat), games shouldn't leave role selection up to the whims of each player.

DICE has not only gotten this consistently wrong, they've made getting it wrong into a principle: on the one hand, their mantra *'rock, paper, scissors'* means that the game balance relies upon teammates competently covering the various roles, but their other mantra *'player freedom'* means DICE is not willing to take any necessary measures to make *'rock, paper, scissors'* actually work.

Now, how exactly role-selection should be handled is up for discussion because the simplest solution (first come, first pick) isn't satisfactory. 'Who should get to fly the jet?' is a difficult question, but 'the guy who happened to spawn next to it at the right time' is not an acceptable answer. Likewise, 'Who must play medic?' is a difficult question, but 'no one' is not an acceptable answer.

**7. Nobody tells me what to do! I'll do what I want!**

So I've already asserted that players must be forced sometimes to play roles they don't want to, but they also must sometimes be forced to go places they don't want and attack/defend targets they don't want. Again, game balance simply requires it to keep each game competitive, so mechanisms must exist that strongly incentivize the player to actually follow orders.

So where would players get their orders? Three possibilities:

* issued automatically by AI
* issued by a teammate in a command role
* issued by vote of the team/squad

Having the AI issue orders is least likely to trigger social unrest. On the other hand, AI decisions could diminish the human element that makes multiplayer (potentially) interesting in the first place.

If elevating certain players to privileged positions is too fraught with drama, voting could work as an effective substitute. For example, in Battlefield, your squad could pick its target by a vote for which flag to capture/defend (with perhaps seniority used to break ties); members of the squad would only be capable of capturing/defending the elected flag, making the vote meaningful rather than something players can ignore.

**8. Voice chat: the highest form of communication known to man.**

If you're like me, the speech center in your brain nearly shuts down when occupied with action. Even for people for whom this isn't the case, voice communication is still not the ideal medium for coordinating team play: even with solid connections, good headsets, and proper audio level balance for all players, it can be difficult to parse everything said or correctly identify who said what (especially in a team of many players).

To make voice chat more effective, larger teams must be broken into squads of four to six players, and those squads must stick together.

To better supplement voice chat, more games should include coordination mechanisms like the placement indicators in Portal 2 co-op. Designers should study the common messages actual players use and integrate them into the game.

Games also must be careful to make sure communication channels of all kinds don't devolve into spam. In several games, the 'enemy spotted' message quickly becomes meaningless because players constantly spam it with a hotkey. In other games, medics tune out calls for healing because the teammates are too often nowhere nearby to be healed and die before the medic can reach them.

**9. Hats for sale! Someone stand on my head so I can get this achievement.**

Every time new items get released for TF2, half the players sit around in spawn for the next week playing the trading meta-game rather than, you know, *actually playing the game*.

Players also get distracted by achievements and character advancement. If I'm trying to get my 1000'th headshot to get an achievement or gun upgrade, I'm not really playing for my team to win.

**10. Hey, there's this neat trick I read about online where if you jump on these boxes in this one exact spot and melee at the same time...**

Some people like to join multiplayer games to *deliberately* Not Actually Play the Game. My favorite kind are the 10-year-olds who want to try the neat exploit they heard about from their friend's cousin who knows a guy who did it once before. 'Don't shoot those barrels! If I stack them in the right way, I can reach that ledge and fall through the floor to...' *etc. etc.*

Others join games to grief, and others just sit in spawn while they organize their hat collection.

Whatever their reason for not actually playing the game, these players must be gotten rid of quickly and without hassle lest they ruin the team balance. Amazingly, many games still don't appreciate this. In fact, few games have figured out how to do vote kicks properly: rather than calling votes that expire, a vote to kick a player should persist indefinitely until a majority has voted to kick the same player.

**11. We won! I guess we killed more (or died less) than the other team.**

In a good, satisfying match, players can tell a story of why and how they won or lost. Even if it's as simple as *'we got pinned down at this place'*, it's still better than just *'the winning team killed more (or died less)'*.

Teamwork is more than just the collective sum of our actions. If you and I are working together, that means we make some decisions together and/or at the very least *observe* each other's major decisions. *e.g. 'we decided to take the underground passage to infiltrate the enemy base, and Ted decided to set up a sentry gun'*. *That* is the beginning of a narrative, a story of what *we* did together.

In an incoherent team match, teammates don't make decisions together, don't observe each other's major decisions, or perhaps just make and observe so many decisions that they all blur into a meaningless mush.

In a great game, the winning-or-losing story of each match tends to be novel rather than the same old thing every single time.

My interest in pop culture is pretty evenly divided between film and videogames and I've begun to notice an interesting trend in videogame story telling. 

There have been several games in the last few years (particularly AAA titles) that utilise some kind of reality bending level, scene or mechanic. So far I've noticed it in Farcry 3, Arkahm asylum/city, Uncharted 3, Amnesia, Dishonered, Mass Effect 3, Bastion and F.E.A.R. but I'm sure there are games that I'm missing.

I'm not an expert on film or television or books but It seems that these other medium rarely if ever use these kinds of sequences in their stories. So much so that I have heard dream sequences being described as tacky, cheap and a cop out when used in film.

I understand that many games have perfectly reasonable dream sequences that are genuinely connected to the core game. [Like the poisoned water in Uncharted 3 or the haunted house in Amnesia](/spoiler). But it just as often seems like something shoehorned into the game for the spectacle or to gamify an otherwise normal activity [Like in Farcry 3 with the mushroom cave or the sex scene that was turned into a monster battle](/spoiler). Overall it just seems that the medium has a tendency to dissolve its own reality.

I was particularly bothered by mass effect 3 [using a dream sequence to get me to care about a child who died before I knew anything about him. I felt like they were using a dream manipulatively to stuff this character into my heart.](/spoiler)

It is absolutely riddled with bugs. Game breaking ones too. I'd say for every 10 hours she plays, she makes about an hours progress. It is constantly crashing to desktop randomly, freezing, failing to save (once you see this error, you can carry on playing but you cannot save at all). Each expansion has made it progressively worse, it's like the developers have totally ignored the previous problems and instead added their own.

I know the Sims is currently a cash cow for the casual market and people are often scoffed at for playing it but even as a 'hardcore' gamer, I do like to jump on the Sims every now and then. Sims 1 and 2 were largely enjoyable and I don't remember any stability issues. What annoys me most though is the rehashing all the features from previous Sims/expansions as expansions for Sims 3 (Pets, vacation, seasons, are expansions for both Sims 2 and 3!), they're not even trying any more.

Same with the Wii before that came out. Videos on the motion controls, learning about all the ins and outs and the Virtual Console.

Same with the 3DS, learning about how that 3D technology worked and the limitations.

And now with the Wii U, finding the first impressions and reviews of the games, learning about the new Nintendo Network (goodbye, friend codes!) and generally just being excited.

I didn't like emptying several magazines into him and seeing no effect. I changed the difficulty from normal to very easy and gunned him down in seconds. I thought ""There, now the game will be enjoyable without all this artificial difficulty!"" 

Later I came across a section where I gunned down several enemies in a space and was about to move onto the next area when I looked back. I was surprised to see a much larger area than I initially thought, with interesting looking nooks and crannies for cover. It was a beautiful area, too. I felt like I just walked right through it, like I just missed out on a whole experience. I saw propane tanks and new weapons I'd completely neglected. Instantly in my head I thought of several ways I could have made it though this area, but didn't due to simply being able to run through.

The idea of upping enemy health and the like to create difficulty seems cheap, but I believe it can enhance the experience. It forces you to use many tactics you wouldn't. (Why explore a deep magic system if you can one hit enemies with a sword?) There are whole new playstyles and depth to be had if the game slows you down, even if that's through seemingly cheap ways.

In the game, there are many bosses, guaranteed at least 3 per level. Each one follows the same general pattern- find weak point and shoot at it until the baddy explodes. Easy, simple, done. So then why am I having so much issue with this game? Why did I feel the otherworldly compulsion to snap my controller in half?

**Tedium and cheap shots.** The games boss fights are *tedious* beyond belief. I played on ""Hard"" initially (I typically do since most modern games are a bit too easy) so I'm not sure if it was a symptom of the difficulty level, but the boss fights take anywhere from 5 - 15 minutes of dodging and shooting, shooting and dodging. In one section, you have to fire rockets a drop ship, and I must have fired at least 25 of the things while simultaneously killing aerial annoyances. My girlfriend asked me if I was done yet, since I had been playing the one section so long.

This extreme length with very little deviation leads to the *illusion* of difficulty. If it takes me longer to kill the boss, it seems harder, but in reality I am not being any more challenged at the end of the 20 minute boss fight than at the beginning. It's just a war of attrition, wearing me down until I finally made a mistake and got killed.

Which leads to my second point- *cheap one-shot-kills*. There is a boss about half-way through, the Gorilla, which absolutely epitomizes the dredge I am speaking about. He jumps, he dashes, he smashes. And nearly every single hit, on Hard, will 'down' you. You either need to use one of your medkits, or have a partner medkit you. (This rarely works, since the AI is too stupid to get to you without getting his face smashed in).

In a 15 minute boss fight, one-shot kills waste a ton of your time and effort, having everything you worked towards (the death of the boss) wiped away. This makes the boss fight not fun or fair, just frustrating and something I desperately I wished to skip to get to the better portions of the game.

While Binary Domain is not a game that everyone will have played (apparently it was barely advertised anywhere), everyone knows of the vilification of Deus Ex: HR's boss fights. They're about as bad as that.

Now, in my excitment to dive in and play every new game I buy (on the console) I tend to skip the game options and dive right into the game.  Well, after the system updates, game updates, game installs, mandatory ""press X to jump"" tutorials, etc.

One thing I never do is check to see if I can turn the minimap off, yet I find that in every game I seem to later have a moment of clarity, and wish I was playing without it.  Why, you may ask?

Well, I hit a point where I realize that I'm almost exclusively ignoring %95 of my screen because I'm playing the game *just* using the minimap.  The latest game that made me realize this is Kingdom of Amalur.  I would use it almost exclusively for travel, and only take cursory glances around every once and a while for treasure chests, or when I saw red arrows on it which indicated an enemy was nearby.  All the necessary information for the game was right there in a half dollar sized circle on my 42"" TV.  I found the same thing happening in various GTA-like games.  Instead of driving around like a sane person, keeping my eyes on the road and looking out for landmarks, I would have my eyes mostly glued to the minimap for directions.  In another genre entirely, I'm sure if there was anything to look at in FF13 I would have missed it as well.

The easiest way to solve my problem was to turn the things off...when I can.  I haven't found an option to in KoA, which is what I'm mostly going to reference because I'm playing it at the moment.  So, how do we fix this?  ""We"" being a community of gamers and developers as a whole?

I've worked out a possible solution for KoA, but it wouldn't work in GTA-like games as well.  I'm a big proponent of games presenting information to you in the context of the game itself.  I don't want to open a menu to see what armor I'm wearing, I want to see what armor I'm wearing.  I don't want games to tell me things or show me things, I want them to let me play those things.  So, we first get rid of the minimap.  In KoA a lot of information, like all of it needed for ""exploring"", is there so what do we do with it?  I propose that all of that information be overlayed on main screen at the press of a button.  There would need to be radius limits of course, but my superior ""find hidden"" skills should allow me at the press of R3 to see colored outlines of unseen baddies, hidden chests, and my current objective.  The only thing I wouldn't put a distance limit on or skill limit on is the objective.  That outline of a cave entrance or NPC should be visible (even if it's tiny) as long as I'm looking in the right general direction to maintain a sense of direction if you get turned around during battle.  You would still need to consult your map for possible routes around, but it would integrate the navigational aids into the game environment itself because I should be looking there most of the time anyway.

What I'm trying to come up with now, are new things I could add to the game that would make it stand out as unique in the zombie genre, amidst the hordes (har har) of other zombie games already out there.

**If you* like* zombie games**, what are some things you've always wanted to see in one that you don't normally see, or haven't seen at all?

**If you *don't normally like* zombie games**, what is something I could add to my game that would interest you in it?

Also, what zombie tropes do you think work well, and what tropes do you think I should avoid?

**Edit**: The feedback I've gotten so far is phenomenal. Thanks everyone and keep the ideas coming!

My question is, why as gamers is that considered a bad thing to some people?

Consider almost every past generation of gaming.  The Super Nintendo was just an upgrade of the NES.  The PS2 was just an upgrade of the PSX/1.  Every generation of Gameboy was an upgrade, until the DS, which has also just recieved upgrades.  Hell, even a PC gamer usually just upgrades their system every few years for new games.  Even the Wii is a Gamecube upgraded to have motion controls. 


I can completely understand the desire to move to digital games (I personally wont, but to each their own).  And I can understand where some people may want the Kinect2.0.  But why are some people so bitter about a gaming console just being a better version of the last one?  One way or another, the games are advancing.  As a gaming community, why isnt that enough?

Note:  I get that some people buy into the whole entertainment center all in one, and thats fine.  But those aspects of the X1 didnt go away anyways, so even the people complaining about it just being an upgraded 360 are ignoring that.  



Side note:  I understand that innovation drives the industry to progress, and thats great.  But I dont think all change is great innovation.   Add on to core ideals all you want, but dont take away privileges.

Beyond simply getting to the end, I also typically completed most or all side quests/optional content. I imagine this had a lot to do with not having anything else to play. Now that I'm a full-fledged adult and can (and do) purchase any game I'm interested in, I'm sitting on a few hundred Steam games, and a dozen or more PS3 and Xbox titles that I haven't gotten around to even starting.

Now not having enough time to start games isn't that unusual; I have significantly less free time now than I did when I was in school, as well as other responsibilities, but of the games I start I finish maybe 10% of them. The last game I remember getting to the end of (not even 100%) was Fallout New Vegas.

In the past 2-3 years I have started, really enjoyed, and then not finished: Borderlands 2, Deus Ex: Human Revolution, XCOM: Enemy Unknown, Stacking, Burnout Paradise, Halo 3/ODST/CE Anniversary, Lego Star Wars Complete Saga, Uncharted 2, Far Cry 3, Fable 2, and Arkham City. And those are just the ones I can remember off the top of my head. For each of them I'd say I got anywhere from 50-80% of the way through the entire story line before stopping.  I certainly put enough hours into the above games to feel as though I got my money's worth, but not seeing the end of those stories sometimes nags at the back of my mind.

**So here's the question:** am I alone in this, or do you also habitually leave games unfinished? And in either case, do you feel that the experience of a game is significantly diminished by not reaching the end? In that vein, if you do this, or have friends that do, why do you think it happens? It it just an embarrassment of available gaming riches, or is it boredom, or something else? Do you think game length is a factor?

Examples of this include Minecraft's Mining/Crafting, Monster Hunter's Crafting, Pokemon's Monster Stats/Locations, Dark/Demon's Souls Item/Stats/Strategies, etc.

For me, I get a great sense of disappointment when I'm playing a game only to be stopped dead in my tracks and then basically be forced to rely on info/help OUTSIDE of it in order to proceed. Since we all won't look at exactly the same websites or read the same messageboard threads, it's very easy for players to have wildly different play experiences.

Even worse, in games like Minecraft, Terraria and Monster Hunter where you do stuff like crafting and that requires combining tons of different items in complex arrangements, the game usually doesn't even attempt to explain anything.

I feel like this approach to explaining game mechanics/items/solutions OUTSIDE of games is a lazy approach to game design.

* Guards turning on streetlights and such (Fable 1 had this, it blew me away)
* Conflicts erupting in the gameworld without direct player participation

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1ZtBCpo0eU

The argument here is that if Quake were made today, it would be like, ahem, ""all the other shooters that are out today,"" being linear, hand-guided, and lacking any trust in the player at all. But while I get the joke, I just don't agree 

First off, I'll say this now, and it might be a bit controversial, but so be it: if you are _only_ considering AAA titles when you talk about gaming today, then you are truly lacking in your world view, and unnecessarily limiting yourself for no good, valid reason.

I gather from the video that its primary point is that all shooters released today are linear, overly molly-coddling, and too easy. I feel that this holds true _only_ if you are using a very small handful of AAA titles as the foundation for your argument. Sure, Call of Duty and its ilk feature linear single player levels and enforced invisible walls, but who _really_ buys those for the single-player campaigns? In these games, single-player modes really only exist to train the player in the mechanics, so they have a chance of competing the the multi-player arenas that are the actual focus of the games, and the reason 99% of the customers buy them.

On the indie market right now we have games like Hard Reset, E.Y.E. Divine Conspiracy, and Killing Floor, just to take a quick glance at my own Steam collection. These games really catch that imaginary gauntlet and throw it right back down in defiance. Open stages to explore, simple introductions, difficult enemies, and a requirement for the player to play well from the very get-go, or fail miserably.

Even other big name games disprove this argument. Look at Borderlands, Metro 2033, Deus Ex: Human Revolution, Crysis, Dead Island, and pretty much the entire Valve lineup, to name just a few. Each with complex, multi-path levels, mechanics that aren't unnecessarily complex, and engaging multiplayer modes (when applicable).

But let's also consider the fact that if Quake hadn't been made when it was made, gaming would likely be totally different. Quake was hardly The First, but it was undeniably instrumental in making the competitive shooter market the beast that it is today. I doubt the Call of Duty and Battlefield fanbases would be nearly as huge had games like Quake not laid that foundation in the industry. I argue that, taking actual history and evolution of the genre into account, if Quake were made today instead of over a decade ago, it would be more or less the same, only with better graphics.

In conclusion, I get the feeling that the creator of that video is pining for one very, very specific type of game: **the story-less, direction-less, context-less deathmatch shooter.** Judging from the follow-up clips of what the creator thinks is ""good"" gaming, it seems that he's primarily just upset that bunny-hopping is no longer a valid tactic in games today.

1318524276.0,101,self.truegaming,lazeb,Moral complexity in games ....,duketime,118,17,131,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/lazeb/moral_complexity_in_games/,"In short, I don't understand the fuss about games involving ""moral complexity"" or tough decisions and such.

Bioshock, for example, was highly praised for the moral dilemmas it presents but I found it really hollow. I mean, I understand there's a choice to be made, but it's not a ""moral"" choice so much as it's an incentive choice: whether you wanted more Adam upfront (and overall) for being a bad guy, or you were willing to take less Adam (and later) but get some other upgrades for being a decent fellow.

And that's pretty much it. In most any game I've played with ""moral decisions"" to be made it's essentially ""you can get more in-game currency for being a jerk or you'll get something less fungible but neat if you're a good guy"". And there's no moral dilemma ... it's what you want more. Especially when the dilemmas are so cut and dry: if you harvest you know you're being a jerk ... you know the ""right"" thing to do for the ""good"" ending, and I venture most people are going to typically try to adhere to this.

And now it's disappointing because all games (especially the RPG sorts) seem to think it's necessary to include this level of morality, but never develop it beyond that. Mass Effect (which I really enjoy), Fallout (which I can't get into), Fable, etc. Either take the obvious high-road and reap such and such benefits, or do the obviously evil (or renegade, etc.) thing and claim those rewards and consequences.

Other issues:

* This sort of game design sort of exclusively rewards polarization. You can do quite well as the bad guy, but pretty much **everything** you do has to be evil (to gain the appropriate ""renegade score"" or whatever). I wouldn't really call it ""moral complexity"" if the decision is between always doing obviously right or always doing obviously evil. For many of these games, there simply is not a way to get a full game experience with any character who does both good and evil.
* The actual consequences of being good and evil are typically nominal. Often (as I said above) the reward structure is different: evil gets more sooner, good gets less later with maybe some cool non-monetary thing tossed in. Beyond that, it's just a bunch of stupid cosmetic stuff. Oh, Shepherd *looks* all evil. Oh my Fable character is all fat and dark looking (but can run just as fast as a svelte character). Oh the city's all run-down. Wow, the city looks nice. Oh, I can only sell my stuff to the black market guy or the upstanding businessman. Etc. All changes are (in practical terms) typically minor, non-gamebreaking, and often cosmetic.

Look, I understand that a lot of work goes into implementing what we have. An artist has to design the decrepit cities in Fable that half of players will never see and a lot of work goes into figuring out how to add these sorts of decisions into what is a much more open experience than a narrative (what if the player destroys a city with a key NPC? We can't have that, etc.). And creating a true moral experience with real, lasting consequences would be immensely hard to develop simply because you will have to account for the case in which the player *does* kill the crucial NPC (the solution is often to account for it in a trivial way, like I say above: the player lets the town go to pot, but the vendors and key NPCs are still hanging around ... nothing's really different from the ""good"" scenario).

I don't want to turn into Roger Ebert, but it often really feels like gamer's are manufacturing the complexity or overblowing it to sort of justify the art of the game when, really, the moral complexity is almost always just not there. For the record, though, I do think games can have moral meaning, it just tends to occur, really, during the narrative portions of the games.

Pretty old spoilers here:

The meta-/fourth-wall breaking reveal in Bioshock was legitimately pretty-mindblowing (and, ironically, the point of the reveal was that the player character was acting completely *without* volition), and the final section of Braid where you are literally just holding down the time-reverse button has significant narrative weight. Of course, as I point out, both of these are narrative tricks and both explicitly not involving character interaction, pretty much.

The first obvious thing that comes to mind is the nature of the war itself - technological advancement (it was the first true, industrial total war) brought about the ""front line,"" an extended line of fortifications facing against another and it was a slow grind for territory between opposing trenches. A game where you go over the top, run across a field of explosions and machine gun fire hoping you're not going to get killed and then reaching the enemy trench to try to clear it out with a bolt action rifle wouldn't be that fun.

So I'd think such a game would have to deviate from the CoD style of war shooter. Some overlap would be possible, it would still be possible to defend your trench from attack, manning machine guns and whatnot - missions like that have been in CoD games and I had a perfectly fun time playing them and close-quarters combat is another option. It's also true that, later in the war, tanks were coming into use as well as lightly equipped, heavily armed shock troops that exploited weaknesses in enemy lines. Playing as a shock trooper might overcome the linear, stalemate-based gameplay of trench warfare.

Maybe it'd also be possible, maybe even necessary to introduce a Mass Effect style character development and storyline to fill in the gaps between combat since trench life was mostly that - days and days of nothing, interrupted by fits of violence.

I enjoyed Assassins Creed (the first one) quite a bit when it came out, but something about it really aggravated me. I wasn't able to put my finger on it right away, but the controls really aggravated me. I never felt confident when playing the game - I was always afraid my character would stop reacting properly.

Then a couple years later Demons Souls came out and it was one of the best gaming experiences I ever had. Everything about the game was solid. And for some reason I started thinking about AC again. I realized that it was the context-sensitive controls in AC that had gotten to me, and that DS was a game with no such thing. Every button had a single purpose, every press did exactly what I expected it to. Always. Swinging a sword always took the same amount of time, using an herb always took the same amount of time. It just worked.

So, since that time a few other games have come out that have embitttered me towards context sensitive controls.

In Prototype there was a race that required you to jump away from a tower towards the end and fall to get a high score but I couldn't figure out how to do that. Every time I tried to jump off the building my character would jump higher, or do some crazy attack, or some other random result. I'm sure there was a way to do it but it wasn't just ""Press away from the building and jump"". I got really frustrated and stopped playing, and I was only a couple missions away from the end of the game too.

Dark Souls came out and they made one control context sensitive - in order to jump you have to be running. I hated this change. It was the only control across the two games that I felt was unreliable.

And finally AC3 came out recently. I enjoyed the game, played it all the way to the end, got 100% on all missions, etc. But I don't feel like I mastered the game in any way, shape, or form. I don't feel like I was playing the game so much as I was kind of guiding the game along and hoping for the results I wanted. There was one mission where all I needed was for my character to jump ahead of himself onto a rail, but I was only able to do that two times out of about 20 tries. The rest of the time he wouldn't jump to the rail, or he'd jump down onto someone below him. 

All of this sounds negative, but the positive aspect is that some of these games allowed for greater versatility and/or are just more visually appealing. I love the Souls games, but they aren't especially fun to watch. Block, swing, block swing, spell, etc. etc. Compare that to some of the crazy shit you can do in the AC games and one of them is definately more visually entertaining.

So I like the options and the entertainment that context sensitive controls allow for, but I hate the lack of control that I feel I have.

Any thoughts? Any games that handled context sensitive controls remarkably well? Someone want to slap me for having such stupid difficulties with the game Prototype?",,False,,t5_2sgq6,False,,,True,t3_13b0hb,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/13b0hb/thoughts_on_context_sensitive_controls/,

Studies have shown that gamers generally have much more control over their dreams, and are much more likely to fight back during a nightmare than a non-gamer (i.e. if a gamer dreams of falling off a cliff they are much more likely to find they have a jetpack, or if they are being chased by a monster they are more likely to pull out a sword). In fact, personally I find I have a disproportionate amount of dreams about me being in a game; just a couple of days ago I had a dream about being inside a COD : Zombies game with a couple of friends who I usually play it with, which got kind of gruesome at the point where I had to try and kill my friend with only a compass and a scalpel (it diverged quite a bit from the usual game mechanics of COD).

So truegaming, why do you think playing games has such an impact on the dreams we have, and as a side question, what sort of dreams have you had which were related to games?

Personally I think its to do with the way we move in games being similar to the way we move in dreams. While we are dreaming I know that the part of the brain we use to move switches off, hence why you often find yourself frozen or in slow motion in dreams, and you have to imagine yourself moving to actually move. In games you don't actually move either - or at least your movements in reality (i.e. moving a thumbstick) don't relate much to your character moving about in the game world, and after a while moving yourself while moving the camera becomes muscle memory, and you are pretty close to moving by imagining how you move.

For instance, imagine a scenario similar to the assault on Goodsprings at the beginning of Fallout NV.

The player has essentially three choices - 1) Defend the village (good), 2) Do nothing (neutral), 3) Assist the raiders (evil).

I think games should reflect that doing Good is usually the hardest path, and that is why it's valued.  Generally if I play a game like Fallout, I know that there is no substantive difference between playing as good or evil in terms of difficulty and reward - so the choice is basically an arbitrary either-or.  While I might get to loot corpses as Evil, I'll likely receive some kind of reward (whether via a gift or in reputation) as Good. 

But what if, in the case of this Goodsprings scenario, 1) Defend the village was ranked as 'almost impossible', and expensive for the player to do in terms of expending ammo/health-kits and of little direct reward, 2) was obviously neutral, and 3) was only somewhat difficult and very rewarding. 

This makes choices much more realistic and *meaningful*, as you're sacrificing something to be good, and there are clear advantages to being evil.  It could also create situations where you *want* to help the village, because you like the characters there, but you simply can't, due to the resources you have on-hand - so you're forced to slink away to save your own skin.  On the other hand, to complete the game doing mostly Good actions becomes an achievement.

I was convinced I had worked out the plot of ME before the third instalment and was severely disappointed that it didn’t match up with the narrative I’d expected ,maybe I’m being an entitled fanboy but now I’ve half-convinced myself that Bioware backed out of a plot similar to my idea out of cowardice and/or laziness. Anyway here it is: I felt there had been all sorts of hints and strands in the game leading towards a plot in which the reapers were merely acting based on the same principles of evolution that organic life is bound by… Here is where I got the sense that this was happening:

1) Reaper procreation: Reaper’s spent the entire second game using the collectors to get human DNA in order to essentially create a human/reaper hybrid. This is essentially reproducing in the same way Asari do. If Bioware had run with that idea then the main plot would have been essentially a gigantic rape attempt… a little creepy I know.

2) Ardat-Yakshi : Building upon this Asari comparison I thought they had been included entirely as a parallel to the way reapers would reproduce since it wouldn’t fit the norms of any form of reproduction and evolution we would be familiar with. Ardat-Yaksi were even more akin to reaper’s I had thought, since sex results in the death of the mate, hence why Morinth echoed Harbinger’s claims of ‘genetic destiny’.

3) Cosmic imperative: The ‘cosmic imperative’ as Javik describes it (to those of you willing to fork out £10) controls all things… natural selection would certainly have influenced reaper evolution perhaps leaving them with the mentality of extreme malice that they have, since those willing to do anything to survive unlike say a good AI (EDI for example reprograms her self-preservation functions to favour altruism if you go paragon) would naturally be favoured and thus more likely to survive. Survival, reproduction and adaptation, as with life, become the goal simply because that is most likely to allow another generation to survive. The Reapers would allow evolution to take its course to a certain extent until they would sweep in murdering organics and using the genetic data to update and evolve themselves just because that is what nature favours.

Here is what I had imagined the ending(s) would be:

A renegade Shepard would have that preordained-by-evolution mentality of survival at any cost, putting his species before any ideal giving in to the selfish gene and the cosmic imperative. This would have involved siding with Cerberus to control the reapers, thereby becoming the dominant force in the galaxy. Perhaps an ultra-renegade/evil Shepard would have put himself before even his own species causing untold destruction in order to save/benefit himself.

A paragon Shepard would have transcended this cosmic imperative perhaps by sacrificing himself (he would have needed the choice to save himself for this to be important, unlike in the actual ending) to save others and destroy the reapers or refusing a chance for power thereby acting against the evolutionary demand for survival at any cost. Maybe even an ultra-good Shepard could have convinced the reapers of the value of the vulnerable and the pointlessness of the forces that move them and they would have ceased their assault having too transcended the cosmic imperative.

This plot, in touching upon that deep darkness in the way our universe is structured – strong destroys the weak and is favoured for reproduction - and in having a space opera based around galactic wide macro-evolution would have been a genuinely profound portrayal of our universe and the forces at work. I was absolutely certain this was going to be the plot twist and was absolutely flabbergasted that they went with a dull ‘they just don’t like organics’ thing instead and I’m half-sure Bioware backed out of this intended plot, or something similar since as I mentioned the inevitable favouring of the strong and ruthless is kind of a dark theme.

In the diary, the author refers to treating the game initially like a game, and suffering a major consequence for it - [a bomb goes off, killing hostages in the initial mission](/spoiler).  This didn't happen in my playthrough.  It didn't even occur to me as a possibility.  I listened to my boss and went straight to the Helipad, pretty much.  I had no idea that my Adam Jensen did the right thing here, and people would have suffered if I didn't.  What a great way to indicate this to the player early on in the game.

It brought to mind Alpha Protocol.  One of the things the game is consistently criticized for is the lack of autosave during combat as well as its checkpoint system.  ""Checkpoints are an old idea, we could save to a Hard Drive now"" console and PC players alike would say.  It frustrated me initially as well - until I realized the point.

Commitment.  Alpha Protocol is about commitment.  If you make a decision, from dialog (DX:HR does this as well) to what guns you take, to how much damage you've taken before entering that room - that is your decision.  In the game, the player becomes Michael Thornton (the player character) because of this forced commitment.

Why was I frustrated at the time?

I had to replay the mission since the autosave from the checkpoint left me at 5% of a health bar while entering a room full of terrorist bodyguards.  Mike and I's run and gun strategy just didn't work as planned.  It was loud, and not particularly covert.  So, I replayed the entire mission, more carefully this time.  I looked at the previous runthrough as a terrible anxiety nightmare that told this new recruit that he needed to hold back.  And the game played great for me.  The game was not afraid of cutting out entire branches, plot points, and characters if you decide to do some other thing instead.  It was not afraid of letting the player make mistakes.

In Mass Effect, there were only two truly consequential decisions I felt from game to game, and that's what made it disappointing.  At no point did I [lose Wrex](/spoiler) or anything, and the choice between [Ashley and Kaiden](/spoiler) was easy [(Max Shepard and Ash were an item at the time)](/spoiler).    And say what you will about how wooden Kaiden was (he was), the completionist in me went to see him all the time.  [So when the elevator opened up and he wasn't there, I *""felt** that absence.](/spoiler)

In Mass Effect 2, some decisions seemed to have far more consequence, others didn't.  I managed to do all of the upgrades and loyalty missions, but one thing happened when I arrived at the final mission: [I watched Yoeman Chambers die](/spoiler).  In a similar mechanic to the above situation with [Kaiden](/spoiler), this was a character that Shep would talk to on a regular basis, [and the perfect choice to show what it means to lose half a crew](/spoiler).  Why?  I was fucking late.  I was busy doing side missions, when the time limit came up, and I had one loyalty mission left.  This mission?  Well it just about resolved everything from the first game.  [I'm talking about Legion](/spoiler).  The consequences of not doing this would be astronomical, and so there was no choice in the matter for Max, Renegade though he was.  So, now it's hard for me to continue as Max, [since he can't walk the bridge without feeling loss](/spoiler).

That being said, promised consequence of game to game in ME just wasn't there.  And aside from a few portions that were designed to be dilemmas, well, there weren't many which represented these choices.  Those two are the shining examples of feeling consequence.  

Mass Effect will explicitly tell you what a consequence might or might not be.  For the most part the moral dilemmas amount to either adopting or shooting a puppy.

Alpha Protocol locks you out of portions of the game if you chose a certain route.  Mike cannot backtrack and try to do it another way.  Once a mission is done the way its done, the story moves on.  

Deus Ex represents consequence without explicitly telling you that you were going to miss out on something.  It requires Adam to improvise from now, to live in the moment while planning out A and B plans, and never treat the game like a dream.

In Mass Effect I found myself, at times, gaming the system despite myself, and I prefer not to do that.  Playing with systems rather than people, the actual choices in game seemed forced and inconsequential in the larger scheme of things (particularly the romance choices).  Max felt like someone I created, but the story felt forced upon him, like he was just along for the ride, with some control here in there.

In Alpha Protocol, I was awe about how much I felt like Mike and less playing like how I wanted to play, but more committing to how I have already played.  Sure, I could switch it up for Mike from time to time, but Mike was someone I played as, not someone I created.  

In Deus Ex: HR, so far I feel like Adam.  Swept in a story by other powers and forced to do things that he doesn't want to do, but hey, it's a violent world and life is cheap.  I feel like I'm playing Adam Jensen the Security specialist / corporate hit-man.  Even though some are playing like Adam Jensen the serial killer or Adam Jensen the pacifistic ghost, or even Adam Jensen the commando, Adam Jensen still feels like a fully realized character partially created by both the player and the developers.

1352352463.0,94,self.truegaming,12udkv,Halo 4: an honest discussion. ,BLUYear,141,47,212,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/12udkv/halo_4_an_honest_discussion/,"It's been a couple of days since the, arguably, most anticipated game of this quarter came out and the consensus seems to be, at least ""professionally"", that it is worth the buy and has been given an ample amount of praise. Metacritic isn't the best factor to truly evaluate a game but it seems that many are rather down on the game and as a person who likes to know what both worlds think I'm a bit stuck on how to truly feel about how others feel. I'd like to know the honest opinions of those of you in /r/truegaming that have purchased the game and have played it through or at least have done enough to have a good take on the experience as a whole. God knows I can't go to /r/gaming for this. 

Personally I think the game is rather fantastic, with some complaints that don't really detract from my overall take. Narrative wise the game is perhaps the most well accomplished of the series, if only due to the shear amount of excellent writing that went to foster the relationship between Cortana and the Chief. Both shine well and a more personal vibe is struck than any other game yet, which is something I hope they continue to do with the following entries. Some things do dangle a bit, with it being rather similar in plot to the other games in the sense that most deal with a larger than life alien weapon that is about to be used for nefarious deeds and Chief must stop them at all cost. The supporting roles here are fun to watch but aren't that well fleshed, though Lasky does have a full on mini movie to his own, which makes him perhaps one of the better characters yet so far. Some minor things like why the Covenant is still the enemy and the lack of truly using the main antagonist to what I thought would have been fantastic showdowns do detract from what I think is an extremely solid effort that deserves to be recognized. 

Sound design is gorgeous and the score is an understandable evolution of the Halo score. I do miss the drums and high intensity of beats that liters the past installments but it more than does the job of immersing a sense of awe. Visually it pushes the limit of what the 360 can do with no detraction on it's performance and its Pre-rendered cut-scenes are some of the best yet developed that I have seen. Some low rez textures and pop ins here and there but nothing major and the frame-rate never dipped during my playthrough, both online and off. But what really holds the presentation together has to be the artistic direction, which just demands your attention. Lighting, depth and coloring all play a substantial role that just makes the game team with vibrant life. 

The gameplay is still Halo, something I think is used more as a criticism rather than a compliment, considering that franchises should retain their flavor. It's quicker and more ""visceral""(ugh, horrible word) and has a good rhythm to it, especially in online where the connection is excellent, with some great map design and creativity thrown in. The perks and loudouts seem to integrate well enough without ever seeming as an intruding element from another FPS camp. 

Campaign is solid with some fun missions and is of a good length. Variety is a bit lacking in terms of objectives and the level layout may be lackluster at points which do hamper the pace of the game, which I think is kept at a good enough balance with what is happening as you progress. The final few missions in particular strike me as peeks into what 343i might cook up with the next one once they feel more comfortable in doing more of what they want and change it up a bit if not add. 

Special mention the modes of Spartan Ops. It's a fun mode with some great potential that promises a long continuation after the endgame.

Weapon wise I think I am a bit at a loss. They are all fun to use but some seem to be reskined designs of others wit h little variation apart from rate of fire. But I'm not that good at judging this aspect of games so I leave that up to more adept people. 

All in all a good time. It's a safe game once you look at it from a far, and it's an understandable decision from 343i but I can't wait for the next one with the hope of something that could come out unique and fresh.

Just play it.

So holy shitballs did I not see this coming. After I finished spec ops I immediately went online to read others thoughts on it. The two leading interpretations of the ending are that either A) walker has been crazy the entire time and most of what you've seen is imaginary or B) walker died in the helicopter crash and is in purgatory (or hell). I have a different interpretation which I think is underrepresented in the discussion.

**No part of the game is meant to be taken literally.**

It is from beginning to end a meta play being put on for the player commenting on such games. The game is not a narrative story but a conversation being held between the creator and the player that takes the form of a modern warfare game.

Everyone seems to touch on the meta aspects of the game, it’s hard not to get the double meaning in “you came here to be someone you’re not, a hero” but I think the meta aspect is the entire game.

**The story makes no real world sense and that is the point.**

Your initial mission is to go in, see if there are survivors, and leave. Within 3 minutes, your mission should be over as you immediately find survivors and should leave. The fact that you do not would not make sense in the real world however in game logic it makes so much sense that it doesn't merit conscious thought. In a video game you move forward and kill things. Of course you move forward, what else would you do? When all you have is a hammer every problem looks like a nail and when all a game lets you do is shoot things than obviously the solution to the problem here is to murder people until everything is better. Even the moral choices in the game are expressed exclusively through you choosing who to shoot or not shoot.

Soon after you discover that the 33rd is hostel. Presumably you have been briefed and at this point know that there are about 1000 soldiers in the 33rd. Here your decision to not turn back goes from being unwise by real world standards to being idiotic to the point that no actual human would do it. There is not a form of ptsd or psychosis that would manifest itself in this manner, it is not a real canonical metal illness. The condition that walker suffers from is not psychosis or ptsd, it is Video Game Protagonist Crazy.

A full list of times that delta team should have left and radioed for help would read like a full plot synopsis of the game but the most notable is the white phosphorus scene.

**Spec ops is a survival horror game where you are the scary monster**

Spec ops is something that shouldn’t have to exist but does; an indictment of the idea that the world’s problems should be solved by a wisecracking team of nigh invulnerable American super men committing small scale genocide.

Walker insists that launching the white phosphorus is the only option, and it is, assuming that you accept the premise that walker’s team has to single handedly murder every soldier in front of them right now and without re-enforcements. When you are launching the white phosphorus it is obvious that the crowd of figures in the trench are not combatants, you have to fire the phosphorus any way. This is because Walker is not you, he is a monster that the developers made in criticism of you. You are meant to be afraid of what you are going to do.

**The increasingly poor decisions of delta team.**

For the rest of the game you basically know how badly everything is going to end. I don’t think anyone thought the water caper was going to end well, you know the helicopter crashes, and pattern recognization tells you how everything after that will go. Delta team’s trip through Dubai is an exercise in applying real world consequences to video game character actions. By video game logic flying into the dust storm is just crazy enough to work, but given the fore knowledge of it’s crash it’s kind of hard to see how it wasn’t the worst idea ever. In many video games you save the world by indiscriminately killing every biped in front of you, so obviously that is how you help the people of Dubai.

**Konrad is the developer**

Konrad is named after the author of Heart of Darkness. Not a character from it. Not an actor from the movie. The author, the story teller.

There is almost nothing that konrad says that can not be interpreted as the developer talking directly to you. When you walk in he is painting the white phosphorus scene, like the developers wrote it, and asks what you think. Walker ways ""this is impossible"" and his answer is ""I assure you it is"". He says none of this would happen if you just ""stopped"". Not left, or gone home, ""stopped"". If you didn't like what you where doing you should have stopped but you kept going because it was engrossing or interesting or fun.

Here the video gamey-ness breaks down. The real konrad is dead because in real life if a soldier went missing for 6 months in a disaster zone they’re almost certainly dead. The prisoner sniper execution thing wasn't real because that’s the kind of bullshit that only happens in video games.

Now the developers have shown you all they wish to and do the video game thing. Give you a choice of how it ends. A “good ending” or a “bad ending”. But like all the hallucinations it fades to white instead of black. Because none of this is real, not in a canonical way but in a “this is not a pipe” sort of way.

# **The History**

So we have this game company called Camelot Software Planning, a division of Sega that developed the **Shining Force** RPG series for the Sega Saturn. However, in 1995 they split from Sega and began their quest to kiss rival Nintendo's ass in apology for working with Sega and make the **Mario Sports** games.

[Hooray for brand recognition](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fa/Mario_Tennis_box.jpg)

However, Camelot did manage to try and make their own IP, starting with shitty **Beyond the Beyond** in 1995. However, during the next 6 years, they began to hunker down and think about their next RPG game. And it went through several different iterations.

[This cluttered screen was only the least of its problems](http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/8/c/5/gfs_41786_2_58.jpg)

First, this new game was supposed to be made for the Nintendo 64, but when the Gamecube was lumbering over the horizon, Camelot decided to shift focus to the up-and-coming Gameboy Advance. Second, the proposed game was so large that it couldn't fit onto a single cartridge, forcing Camelot to split the game into two parts. Thus, we come to its finalized forms, **Golden Sun** and **Golden Sun: The Lost Age**.

# **The Gem**

This was a really well designed game. The game holds up really, really well more than ten years later. This game was just really, really, really good.

Really.

Ok, serious stuff. What really shines in this game is its structure. Everything, from the story to the gameplay to the puzzles, is based around an ability called *Psynergy* (sin-er-gee? si-ner-gee? Goddamit), a psychic, earth-wind-fire-water-based ability controlled by people called Adepts. You defeat enemies by using Psynergy. You solve puzzles by manipulating the environment using Psynergy. You save the world from collapsing by manipulating Psynergy at the Elemental Lighthouses. It's a very consistent experience that, coupled with its beautiful ancient-Mediterranean/Asiatic-inspired artwork and memorable soundtrack, makes it a really immersive game.

[Well, at least until you encounter the invisible walls...](http://www.vgcats.com/fan/guestcomic/evilish_vgcgsgc.jpg)

Another key component of Psynergy are these cute little creatures called Djinni, the guardian spirits of the four elements, that you find by either finding them or finding them *and* fighting them. These little creatures can be used in battle, but their main usage is their ability to be equipped and change your characters into different classes. And the classes are amazingly varied. Some range from powerfully hard-hitting characters (Ronin and Chaos Lord) to amazing healing/Psynergy based characters (Pure Mage and Ranger). **The Lost Age** mixes this up a bit by adding item-based, gimmicky classes (Beast Tamer, Harlequin, and Necromancer) that require equipping specific items. What class you choose will ultimately determine your battles.

[So cute, aren't they?](http://thegamersthumb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/fdafgsdaf.png)

Thus we come to the final facet of this amazing gem: the battle system. The battles themselves are really standard RPG fare. You start each turn by giving your commands, then the battles play out depending on the speed stat a la **Dragon Quest**. But what the battles do really well that you have to think about certain consequences of each action.

* You can save your PP and use your weapon, which has a chance of doing shit damage or unleashing a powerful special attack. 

* You can use powerful Psynergy, which sucks up your PP like nobody's business. 
 
* You can use Djinn in battle to unleash powerful attacks or buffs, but risk a drop in stats or even a detrimental class change.  

* Using Djinn allows you to get them ready for a really powerful Summon attack, but you have to wait for the Djinn to recharge one by one each turn, leaving you open to devastating attacks.

* Even the items serve as frugal alternatives to actions, giving you flexibility in your choices.

This give and take system really changes up the turn-based battles, and if you plan ahead a bit, then these battles become a fast-paced joy. There are other little nuances in battles that make them really well paced. Instead of saying things like 

&gt; `It was not very effective...`

you are given a message like 

&gt; `Wimpy Bat took 36 dmg!!`

where the ending punctuation simply lets you know how effective that move was. And if the move was super effective *and* kills the enemy, you get treated with a rainbow-glowy enemy disentegration animation and extra exp! It just felt good when you killed the enemy, coupled with a dramatic pause and satisfy sound effects.

[Man, this game even had the best particle effects](http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20061215200054/goldensun/images/8/8e/PsyFire.bmp.jpg)

As you got further into the game, bosses became really challening.  The bonus bosses for each game really drive home how mind-numbingly frustatingly hard these bosses are. Even during my 5th playthrough, I found myself biting my nails as I prayed that Dullahan would leave my Djinn alone and not summon Charon to destroy  me and -

[FUCK](http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20080217045148/goldensun/images/2/2b/DjinnStorm.png)

One last bonus of this game is that there is a Colisseum option you could choose where you can test out different party arrangements or just beat up monsters and even bosses. And since it's not part of the game, you can fool around with the battles here at no cost. It's even where the multiplayer of the game takes place, where you can fight your friends (Weirdly, though, you could only use three characters instead of the usual four).

There are other smaller, really nice technical things:

* You can read the mind of almost EVERY NPC

* You can save ANYWHERE

* Your PP heals naturally by walking around, which makes it more like stamina than magic points


-----

# **The Shit**

Ok, this game is not perfect. I'll start with the battles by saying fuck random encounters. Just, fuck them. 

Then there is this scenario:

&gt; `Isaac and Felix target the same wimpy bat.`

&gt; `Isaac beats the shit out of the wimpy bat with Megiddo.`

&gt; `Felix then, instead of attacking the next enemy, decides to sit on his ass and eat cookies.`

Another annoyance comes from the fact that **GS** erects a big juicy wall at the end of the game, preventing you from backtracking to previous towns. **TLA** doesn't have these walls, but you can't re-visit the land from **GS**, a shame that is compounded when you sail by those areas in your flying ship.

The World Map is also way too large and boring. Most of the time you'll just be traveling across the same, monotonous, patchy grassy roads. There are no major monuments besides towns and dungeons, so it can get pretty easy to get lost on the winding road, which I found pretty funny since the game world is essentially linear. Even when you get the ability to sail across the seas, the *ocean* is way too huge, ironically. See, sailing works in a game like **Windwaker** because there are a lot of little events or areas to explore in the big deep blue, but in **Golden Sun**, there is nothing really interesting to explore since it's built like a linear RPG, so it gets really boring and really ploddy.

[Funnily enough, though, if you look carefully, the world of Weyard looks really familiar somehow...](http://www.freewebs.com/goldensun_warrior/040419174035.jpg)

Even the Psynergy used for puzzles lends to the linear build of the game. It just feels too contextual. You can only create climbeable vines if you stand in front of a sprout, which are only placed in climeable areas. And when you see an area lined with a dotted border, chances are something here needs to be pushed or pulled to complete the puzzle. You can't even move it continuously. You can only move things one space at a time, making things rather tedious. There's just a general lack of interactivity with the environment,  which is disappointing when Psynergy itself is supposed to be an ability to manipulate the environment at will. Maybe if they did it more like how you make your ship fly, where you can sustain the effect at the cost of draining PP, it would've felt more natural.

[I mean, I can only manipulate flames if I'm standing next to it? I HAVE A MOVE THAT'S A FUCKING LASER BEAM. CMON!](http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20080224080855/goldensun/images/9/90/PsyBeam.png)

But the worst of the problems come in the form of the games' cutscenes. Or rather, compensation for a lack of them. See, you can't really have nice-looking prerendered cutscenes in a GBA game. What you *can* have is dialogue. And boy, did Camelot compensate with dialogue. Even pressing the A button to speed things along doesn't speed up characters nodding their heads or slowly plodding their way across the screen. And you get no interaction. The main protagonist of both games are mute, so they really only take part in conversations with simple ""Yes"" or ""No"" confirmations, neither of which affect the conversation in any way.

[I guess he got traumatized by this guy](http://tartarus.rpgclassics.com/goldensungba/images/startgame/golden15.png)

# **The Final Word**

Despite the small annoyances, everything else that makes this game amazing vastly outweighs its negatives. Its intuitive combat tied in with its intricate puzzles and dungeon design makes for an epic RPG on the GBA. I played this game almost 20 times through, and each time I enjoy it as if it were the first.

Get this game any way you can. If you decide to emulate, you can easily speed through the cutscenes, which is a nice plus.

Insane graphics that have not been seen in a military-man FPS, huge 64 player maps and the same mechanics I had known and loved. 

I did have fun the first few days but immediately it began to get a little stale. Now I haven't touched it in weeks. And its not like I'm not a fan of the genre, with my title I mention how much fun BC2 still is to me (I'll elaborate on why in a bit). But it quickly dawned on me that the teamwork was just terrible on public servers, match after match of nobody except a couple of us doing the objectives. But that wasn't really the issue I saw, the biggest was that the gameplay just wasn't cutting it. 

With BC2, there was a definite feel of push back and push forward. Maybe the linearity of the maps had to do with it, but people were organized even in public matches because what was going on was clear. So the problem I saw in BF3 was that almost every map had no such organization. Yes they were big. But the actual area of action was hilariously tiny on some maps. Kharg Island, for example, could have people in A sniping someone out in B and all the action centered around that area. In BC2, the small yet well-separated hotspots of action was the thing that made it exciting. That's why after two years I still play every once in a while and enjoy the maps, even if I've played on them hundreds of times. The team play is still solid due to the layout of things. If you are losing, at least you know its because the other team was actually better, not because you're a disorganized mess. Or maybe the community is just full of people who actually want to be there? I really don't know. 

I just can't pin-point it. The other thing that worries me is the new explosion of TWENTY fucking extra DLC maps. A good game can stay fresh and new for years on just a handful of maps *if they're well designed*.

Games like Tomb Raider, Bioshock: Infinite, Skyrim, Far Cry 3, and even Call of Duty have suffered the same complaint: You kill too many people for too little reason.

Obviously I'm far from alone in noticing this trend in both reviews and games. This is part of the basis for the complaint that gaming is too violent. There's been a lot of talk from a lot of different people about how gaming's stories are held back by the sheer amount of deaths involved in completing most major games. Even Mario kills an untold number of Goombas on his way to saving the princess.

Most people seem to focus on a need to change how we build games, but I don't really think that's necessary. What we need is to promote discussion of how to better represent a concept that most of us 'true gamers' have internalized: That of the non-character entity (NCE, because what gaming needs is more TLAs).

NCEs are any game objects which you defeat which don't effectively exist in the story. They are the hundreds of police officers in Bioshock Infinite or the legions of bandits in Borderlands. As a group they have a justification for existing, but on an individual scale they don't actually exist in the story. If you were to focus in on any specific Bioshock Infinite police officer you would find that (s)he has no name, no backstory, and no place in the story. Similar NCEs exist in pretty much every game.

The idea I'm slowly working my way around to is that perhaps the solution is to find ways to highlight which objects (I hesitate to call them 'people' even if a specific NCE appears human) are purely there to provide challenge in the game *without* breaking immersion. And that's the key bit: Not breaking immersion. Many of us are able to unconsciously ignore mass bloodshed of NCEs because we've gotten used to it. New gamers are put off by it because they haven't.

So ultimately that's the problem that (in my opinion) needs solving: A way to make it obvious that a given 'person' is actually a NCE without breaking immersion.

I think I've rambled for long enough. What are your thoughts on the matter? Is this even a problem? Should we even have NCEs in the first place? (How) Should we represent them in game?

* What if they removed some of the item grinding aspects of the game or allowed you to bot some actions (ex: Fairyland online you can leave you character to mine, hunt, fish, make items, etc) cause there is less benefit in grinding in an RPG compared to an MMORPG (yes it happens in both but there is less incentive in RPG's cause you can't sell for as much or show off the rewards) ?
* What if they added like a ghost feature (like in racing games where you race against yourself in time trials) but where you can have other players ghosts and have their dialogue (ex: fight this and then that, go left, need a heal, check out this item I got, wait a sec, etc or hear the conversations they previously had on the map) ?
* What if they had bots selling items, and the developer's made the prices fluctuate like they would in MMORPG's (instead of having hundreds of shopkeepers)?
* What if they made it so you can play by yourself but then you had the option of adding friends to your game, or opening it up to the public (like you import other characters into your game, or you could import yours to the public)?
* What if the developers analyzed like a 100 different raids and made bots to have similar types of dialogue and played the same way as players.

Some sad parts in the story (that were overturned soon after) and that's about it. But this is judging the game years and years after it had been originally released.

Can anyone recall the original context of the game, and suggest what was particularly innovative about it at its time of release? I know that 3D adventure games were in a state of infancy, more or less, so there must have been *something.*

But in an RPG, such as Skyrim, doesn't this take away from the Role Playing part? You can easily quicksave, mess up, try it again. It feels like it takes away a certain amount of risk. Let's compare that a game like League of Legends. Because it's live, there is no quicksaving. If you mess up/use the wrong skill/go to far into enemy territory, you die. Because of this you are much more careful and attentive. What if RPG's were to change death to make it a bit more risky?

It got me thinking a bit so i posted the following comment

&gt; I always saw myself as a hardcore gamer because I enjoy playing high fidelity games on PC (mostly FPS) that require a fair amount of skill. I don't play too often though, and probably not more then 1 hr a day on average. I am still good at many of the games I play, even though I'm not practicing as much as others.

&gt; It seems that hulu has a different idea of what hardcore is compared to how many gamers see it. Most people just see two camps, hardcore (high fidelity, and/or high skill cap with a steeper learning curve), and casual (easy to pick up by most, small learning curve*).

&gt; Their use is fair I guess, but maybe they should have left in times without labels. I know many people that spend hours a day playing a combination of flash games, facebook games, and smartphone games, but they are hardly ""hardcore"" into those games.

&gt; *This is why many people lump COD games into the casual category.

Then i realized that A) I was very late to the party and B) I was trying to have input in a gaming thread that was not a 1 liner or meme image.

So now I come to you guys to ask what IS a hardcore gamer (or game...)? Is my take on it correct in that most gamers label via hardcore or casual depending on the games they play (and possibly their skill at those games) rather then sheer time spent playing?

I'm especially talking about Pathologic and The Void.,jasonlehr,110,13,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/kkfce/is_anyone_fascinated_with_russian_game_design_im/,"A few years ago I played a game named *Pathologic*, on reading an [editorial about it on RockPaperShotgun](http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2008/04/10/butchering-pathologic-part-1-the-body/).  It took me about a year of stop-and-go before I actually played it from start-to-finish in a period of a month.

For those of you who haven't heard, it's a first-person RPG about a doctor who visits a Russian town at the turn of last century which has been infected by a mysterious plague.  The game forwardly tells you the story finishes in 12 days.  It breaks the fourth-wall at every turn--there's a theatre motif that permeates the game, and characters that speak directly to you, the player.

Ultimately, the game becomes about raw survival: forming alliances, working the town's bizarre economy, really drilling deep into the secrets of the town.  At the start you pick one of three healers, and the two you don't choose become NPCs (and you don't completely know where you stand with them).  You only experience one side of the story with each playthrough.

I went on and played another game by these developers, [The Void](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/the-void-review), a surreal, beautiful and virtually impenetrable game.  In the game you play as a soul drifting in purgatory.  The world of *The Void* has been drained of colour, and colour is constantly draining out of you… you need to constantly scavenge for colour to stay alive.

--
Basically, I think these games have value for two main reasons:

1) **Not being afraid of complexity**.  Instead of opening with a basic tutorial level and introducing gameplay elements gradually, it dumps you face-first into the middle of its fully-functioning system, and says ""you figure it out.""

There's always an immediate threat, often tied into its survival mechanic (e.g. hunger meters), and so for the opening segments of the game you're madly scrambling along just trying to survive.  The gameworld of *The Void* was so abstract that I had no idea what anything meant for the first 10 hours--I was just madly collecting enough colour to survive the next hour.  At some point, however, everything clicked into place.  I suddenly knew what each character represented, and what the goal of the game was.  I even realised that the tutorial lied to me.

2) **Disempowerment and exploring negative emotion**.  These games, along with *STALKER*, and perhaps *Metro 2033*, rely on taking control away from the player.  The atmosphere of the game-world and its mechanics work together to explore negative emotions: not just fear, but hopelessness, depression, fatigue etc.  *Pathologic* left me physically drained at the end of each session, but so did reading ""1984""--both were interesting experiences.

Certainly, fun is the object of the vast majority of games.  And that's cool.  It's just like how a song on the radio has to boil down to being catchy, and having a nice steady beat.  However, that's not all games have to be.  

Schindler's List, or American History X are not fun movies.  There's no fun in the movies, at all.  You won't smile through the movie, and you won't feel good after the movie.

It seems to me that gamers by and large critique the ""gameplay"" on essentially...what you need to do to win the game, or get all the achievements.  Basically stripping the game down to the specific, ""what are my inputs that I have to correctly do, and how fun is it to do them?"" question, without taking into account the feelings and emotion that you receive throughout the game.

1310053716.0,97,self.truegaming,ij49f,Why I love pubbing in L4D2,ShadyJane,114,17,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/ij49f/why_i_love_pubbing_in_l4d2/,"Preface: For those of you unfamiliar, Left 4 Dead 2 is a FPS where 4 players battle their way through hordes of zombies over a series of maps with the intent to survive the entire campaign.  It places a lot of emphasis on team work and communication because any one player by themselves without help can be killed/incapacitated with ease.

Now simply mentioning pubbing campaigns in L4D2 will yield a diverse set of responses.  Some will laugh at you, some will agree that it can be fun, most will relate their personal horror stories during their own attempts and state that they now only play with friends.  I am here to implore you to try again.

My main observation is that pubbing a campaign in L4D goes hand in hand with the very foundation of the game: 4 strangers relying on each other to survive a zombie apocalypse.  To me the appeal comes from the different types of players you are paired with.  Now don’t get me wrong.  Sometimes you get teamed with griefers but I don’t consider them players and hence are not in the scope of this thread.  Man I hate griefers.

I’m sure everyone can name the types of people they are teamed up with.  Sprinters. Clueless.  Rambo.  Slow Pokes.  Item Whores.  The list goes on.  The challenge (and thus the appeal…for me) is dealing with these less than desirable strangers and make it all work regardless…survive the campaign.

The fascinating part comes from the transformation my teammates and I go through over the course of the 4-5 maps.  During the first map I am almost always convinced that I am teamed with 3 retards.  So I simply follow and observe.  By the second map there has usually been at least one reckoning of sorts.  What I mean by that is there is a moment in the game where someone either deliberately helps another teammate or deliberately abandons them.  Not only will everyone’s opinion shift, but so will their play style.

Being saved by the guy you thought would only run ahead changes your entire perception of how you should treat that person (usually…obviously there are exceptions to everything I am saying).  More than that, saving the guy who keeps running ahead and then going a step further and healing them may change that player’s opinion of you and have him start controlling his scouting nature.  If they don’t change at all you know to never waste your own supplies on that player.  Neglect your team enough and others may decide that they’d rather not survive if it means having to survive with you.

By the 3rd map everyone has a pretty good idea of what they can expect from their teammates: their strengths, their weaknesses, even their general play style.  Even though Nick refused to heal you he also has suggested the best places to setup for crescendos.  Despite Rochelle running ahead constantly she also has been sharing most things she finds.  Then there is the opposite side: Ellis has been helpful and cooperative all game but his friendly fire is atrocious.  There is usually a give and take and it becomes more apparent as you find yourselves relying on each other more and more.

Let me tell you something.  Beating a campaign on expert with a bunch of friends you know well is satisfying.  Beating a campaign on expert, while managing the conflicting characteristics of a bunch of strangers, is more satisfying than I can describe (imo).  You overcame the odds.  You found a way to make it work in the face of defeat…and you probably had a pinch of luck with the AI Director.

With all that said there is also a huge patience factor involved that is not common for every player in every game.  Not everyone is willing to restart the first level 4 times before finding your stride…not even me.  That doesn’t change the sense of reward I have experienced by dragging a group of misfits through to the very end (or being dragged myself for that matter).  I recommend everyone give it another try.  Helping out a jerk several times to see them transform into the team player is just an achievement in and of itself

Or in other words, why gate content anymore?",sonofafinch,148,53,154,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/q3s4x/skipping_combat_why_not_or_in_other_words_why/,"Surprised there hasn't been a discussion on why we can't skip something like combat in certain games due to recent events. If you need some context, you should read [this RPS article](http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/02/23/escape-escape-embracing-skippable-combat/) beforehand.

On the subject of skipping combat, obviously that doesn't apply to all games (FPSes, RTSes) but it does apply directly to RPGs (or at least ""fighting and dialogue"" games). The argument is that if you can skip past dialogue, why can't we skip past combat sections as well? 

Before attacking that position on the basis that combat is the crux of all gameplay, dialogue is also gameplay and not simply an intermission between combat session (except in terms of pacing) in RPGs.

If you look at the upcoming Mass Effect 3, there are three ways to play it:

* ""RPG mode"", which you play both guns and conversation parts of the game with full control over making dialogue choices and being able to adjust combat difficulty. 
* ""Story mode"" basically tunes combat down to trivial (but not skippable) while retaining the dialogue choices of the game. 
* ""Action mode"" basically boils down any dialogue choice to an automatic pick and plays it as if it were a cutscene; combat difficulty is still adjustable here.

Of course, the topic of skippable combat is still new (or newly revived) but I think a Story mode is a good bridge if it gets implemented in future games. I'm a stodgy old man when it comes to dealing with combat in RPGs. Sometimes I'll begrudgingly do it or even push up the difficulty because I *personally* think it is part of the game I want to play, become familiar with and possibly try to master; I'll have none of this casual combat difficulty but I can understand why it should be an option.

This also touches on the concept of why have an ""easy""/casual difficulty mode. I'll almost never even consider turning down the difficulty but I can see why those less comfortable with playing video games would want to have the option. Easy difficulty should not be a stigma even amongst hardcore gamers simply because it wasn't intended for them anyway.

Combat though, from the many (but not extensive) RPGs I have played, generally is the large portion of the game. I think the only recent story-driven RPG I can think of is **Alpha Protocol** that could have skippable combat and still work fine.

* The dialogue / choice &amp; consequence systems were arguably the true gameplay of Alpha Protocol. Decisions you made in dialogue might only reveal their consequences much later on, not to mention the dialogue system in itself is a game since you have limited time to make choices. The decisions you make in the game can spiral out considerably: in one playthrough you might not have certain information (possibly due to certain previous choices) on an NPC, which in turn makes a huge difference on how you(r character) will interact with them.

* There are plenty moments where a mission is just dialogue (or combat-free) or simply not your typical traverse-environment/engage-in-combat scenario such as [the Gelato Shop in Rome](/spoiler), or [the Mansion scouting mission - also in Italy - where you scan people through the scope of your sniper rifle](/spoiler) or even the many missions where you meet with a character and try to obtain a certain result (piss them off, recruit their help, etc.). The latter can also happen during ""regular"" missions.

* It can be argued the combat in the game just plain sucks (from a TPS standpoint) which is why it turned off so many people (though the combat is fun/satisfactory from an RPG standpoint); if it could be skippable (besides requiring you do do any choice &amp; consequence-based decisions during the mission) it might have been easier for some people to pick up if the combat turned them off.

(Another fine example is Planescape: Torment where everyone you ask will advise you to invest all your points in INT and WIS and avoid getting into combat/talk yourself out of it.)


Lastly, the video is also linked at the end of the RPS article, but there is a [not-so-serious observation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4AmIKhfr40&amp;feature=player_embedded) on video games essentially gating content to people where other entertainment media don't. To paraphrase the first minute or so of the video: books, movies, and albums don't *punish* you for not being good enough at reading/watching/listening to it, so why should games? You can skip chapters on DVDs or you can flip to the middle or end of a book, so why can't we also choose where to start playing the game instead of being forced to start from the beginning?

If you find the dialogue part tedious, then someone probably finds the combat part of the game equally tedious.

Just needed to put my thoughts down in writing, with an emphasis on rant and a few questions, and TrueGaming is always good for that!


Soul Calibur V does a lot I like, but a lot I don't. Praises out of the way first, I really like the increase in speed and the new critical edge system (especially after the disastrous Critical Finish/soul guage from 4). Sometimes I feel the brave edge moves devalue the standard moves, but it's overall a definite improvement.


I definitely understand the removal of parry and implementation of just guard in order to raise the skill cap. However with most of my friends being casual players it's just increased the gap between us. What was previously closish battles with parrying on both sides has become more of a slaughter as I'm the only one pulling off GIs and JGs (some of my friends even eschew the sticks for a controller, it's become so one-sided it's a little ridiculous).


Which brings me to my annoyances. I far prefer local play and so skill difference is always an issue. In the past playing with different health was rarely a solution as it becomes a case of either they win by getting 3 hits in or I have to essentially perfect them. However we did always used to play at 200% health for longer more rewarding battles. There is no option for this for the first time I can remember!?!? Why remove such an effortless thing to implement!?


So we used to find balancing skill was far more fun using Team Battle, one person with 3 characters and the other with 6-8. This feature is also missing!? My most enjoyable games have been in this mode, and it strikes me as pure laziness not to implement it.


You also can't make the time limit larger than 60 seconds, and we used to greatly enjoy taunting, feinting, bluffing standing off whilst verbally beckoning the other player to try to rush them... now it's almost a race against the clock, even at only 100% health.


The entire game seems centred around online multiplayer, even the VS mode defaults to ""Player VS CPU"".


Now I understand it's a creative choice to remove characters, especially as they've added new ones and have fewer clones, as well as it's a larger effort. But losing characters like Talim, Zasalamel and Setsuka seems odd to me, due to the fact they were rather unique characters. I didn't enjoy the latter two, but Talim has been a favourite of our group for some time, and her absence is sorely felt.


But removing a lot of these other features I've mentioned seems absurd, as whilst I know little about the process most of them cannot possibly be difficult to implement. Also as far as I'm aware Namco have rarely been one to really listen to the fanbase, and definitely not one to try to patch features in, they tend to just release a game and leave it until the sequel. However a guy can be optimistic...

**TL;DR: Project Soul has done a good job of fine tuning the gameplay, but seems entirely ignorant of desired/previous features, especially when it comes to local multiplayer. Does anyone know of any precedent or inkling that this has a chance of being fixed?**

EDIT: *IS* there actually any kind of direct line to developers the way we have with American/European ones through forums (or even crash on the BF3 subreddit)? Is there any precedent of them truly listening to fans and implementing changes or patches?

I have fallen in with two distributed teams, both of whom want to develop an indie game.  They are both in the initial planning stages, and it is all done in what free time the members have.  The one thing both teams have in common is the desire to include RTS elements, whether it is central to gameplay, or an additional element to single player MMO play.  

One team wants to build a MMORTS in first person.  I think this is a bad idea, the second, small instanced battles in third person.  I have tried to get both teams to watch, and absorb [Penny Arcade - Extra Credit, Season 3, Ep. 3 - The MMORTS](http://penny-arcade.com/patv/episode/the-mmorts) but so far it seems to have not been influential on the group wanting to make the MMO.  First, is there anything wrong with the ideas presented in the above video?

My second question is, what would you do to make RTS games better, more fun, more accessible, and maybe less micromanaged?

I like many of the ideas presented in the video above.  Having only played the original Starcraft, and a few other old strategy-related games; Sacrifice, and Jagged Alliance 2 (Different beasts I know), I don't know how things are currently done.

I believe they even have a publisher sitting on the sideline just in case if they need more money.  So lets be generous and say they have access to around 30-40mil total to build the game.  That's quite a bit of change for a game that started on Kickstarter.  But is it enough?  I am afraid its not.

I bought the Jak and Daxter collection about a month ago, on a whim. I had never played it before, and I knew nothing about it other than the fact that it had recieved critical acclaim. I figured now was as good a time as any for me to play it, now that school was over.

A couple of weeks later, I had finished all three games. But I have to say...I was disappointed, for the most part. 

The first game was honestly my favorite. The level design was gorgeous, and the bright colors were a soothing sight to my eyes after playing Darksiders. The platforming was tough, but it was top notch, and fair, for the most part. I had a great time exploring the world and collecting the orbs.

The second game was where I saw things begin to deteriorate.

The new settings and characters and all that jazz I was okay with. It was the open world that really got me. Because it really wasn't open! Jak II was the first game where I've ever been stuck in traffic. With GTA there's enough open space to be able to maneuver myself around pedestrians and other vehicles. The small lanes and lack of things to do made moving from mission to mission in Jak II a chore. The combat was also improved a bit, though to be honest I didn't really feel like that much was necessity. I feel like the move from the first to the second game was so jarring, and perhaps a bit unnecessary. I had enjoyed the open world exploration of the first game, and I suppose my expectations were not where they should have been, because this was a drastic departure.

Thankfully, Jak III put some of my woes from the second game at rest. Everything felt more tightly designed. But the driving sections in the desert just killed me. Perhaps it's my lack of skill as a gamer, but they were soooo difficult! And not in a ""tough but fair"" sort of way. But in a ""I just slightly moved my car an inch to the left and now I'm going to tumble down this hill and oop the time's up time to start ALL THE WAY OVER"" sort of way. Thankfully I was invested enough in the characters to see my way through to the end, but I wasn't enjoying myself all the way through.

To that end: What did you all think of Jak and Daxter? Have any of you played it back in the day, and again now, and do you feel like nostalgia plays a part in the critical acclaim of the game? How do you feel about the stark contrast between the first game, and the other two? Would you like to see a return to the series, and if so, what would you want it to be like?

I appreciate any and all discussion.",,False,,t5_2sgq6,False,,,True,t3_1f6hy2,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1f6hy2/i_played_jak_and_daxter_for_the_first_time_this/,

The first Assassins Creed game was my first experience with an 'M' rated title and, while full of potential, it was far from perfect. I was intrigued by the obscurity of Abstergo and the depth of its historical impact as well as the altruistic motive its founders had for their villainy. Also the iconic, mellow feel of the first game was something that all of its sequels never captured. 
Don't get me wrong--the second game was certainly very fun and had a more substantial plot than its predecessor. But it's dialogue was too cheesy for me to approach it with the same level of maturity that I did with the original Assassins Creed. And then Brotherhood and Revelations came along and left me a little less than satisfied. The combat became so mind-numbingly easy and just felt unnecessary and over-dramatized-- much like the plot. Then three was thrown out with the same problems made more obvious in a time period and setting that felt too close and familiar to make a convincing historical/science fiction. 
Maybe I'm just being a cynical prick blinded by nostalgia but I really wish that Ubisoft had taken another direction with this amazing series.

Where do you think we'll go from here?,deiphiz,133,36,185,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/16gyku/2013_seems_to_be_showing_a_lot_of_new_different/,"These past few years have shown already a lot of different shakeups to the gaming industry. We've had our [longest console cycle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_video_game_consoles_(seventh_generation) ever that's still more or less going on. Mobile gaming has been redirected a bit with the advent of the smartphone and it's $1 - $5 games. Even PC gaming, which people once thought was dying, seems to be picking up a lot of steam (no pun intended) as more people [are building their own gaming PC's](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc) for the cheap games and improved graphics.

But I think this is probably the first of many changes we'll see in the industry. End of 2012 saw the release of Nintendo's Wii U, sort of starting a new console generation. But just at this year's CES, we've seen [Nvidia's Project Shield](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOHNmzz1gYo) and [Valve's ""Steambox""](http://www.polygon.com/2013/1/7/3848826/xi3-and-valve-unveil-a-modular-computer-optimized-for-steam-and-big) which are blurring the lines between mobile and console gaming, and desktop and TV gaming respectively. On top of the *those* consoles, we also have the crowd-sourced consoles [Ouya](http://www.ouya.tv/) and [Gamestick](http://www.gamestick.tv/), and the yet to be announced upcoming consoles from Sony and Microsoft. That's about 7 consoles, and we're not even talking about phones or PC's!

Still, there are so many other things to mention. Things like how Valve is pushing Steam to Linux; could it have the possibility of removing Windows as the operating system for gamers to go to? Even indie games are starting to get even more populous as game development is becoming a very popular career choice. Just check /r/gamedev, /r/IndieGaming, and even the iPhone app store, and you'll see what I mean.

Personally, I think this could mean two things. On one hand, this is maybe showing that games are maturing and are becoming more ingrained in our culture. As so many games are being made for so many different kinds of demographics, it's becoming hard to determine what exactly defines a ""gamer"". That could be exciting. It could mean that games now are like how movies were in the early 1900's. Sure we still get [some confusion and controversy over the medium](http://www.develop-online.net/news/42956/Violent-games-bill-dies-without-a-vote), but it probably won't stop development of games any time soon.

Yet on the other hand, we also might see another [1983](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_video_game_crash_of_1983) happen. This thought I'm not placing my bet on, but it is a possibility. I mean, with all of this hardware coming out, plus the shitware we often see in thrift stores, the average consumer might start to get a little overwhelmed. What was once a simple choice between three consoles and a computer, now might be a hard decision between so many different devices to game on.

Thank you all for your contributions! The games that we ended up featuring were Braid, Minecraft and Crisis. We also let people play Osmos, VVVVV, And Yet It Moves, Portal 2, and Left 4 Dead 2.

Braid was a great game to show because we didn't start over each time, instead everyone worked together to get to the final level. I even had people come back twice in order to play later on in the game if they got stuck earlier on. Everyone was captivated by the art and the concept of shift = time reversal, while a lot were very excited when you didn't outright DIE and have to start over (like in mario bros).

People were in love with Minecraft - I started them off in passive adventure mode in a giant jungle map with huge castle buildings. They were amazed with the idea and a lot wanted to get it for themselves.

It was a overall huge success and thank you all for commenting!

V *Original Post* V

Give me your opinions! It's going to be a quick tri-fold presentation in a few hours, and people will be walking around seeing several presentations. I want them to play one 'violent' game and one 'good' game. I don't want to discuss my paper's topic at the moment, but If you could just list out some games that you'd like to play if you were in the presentation I'd appreciate it!

Basically just games you don't have to do multiplayer in, and that can be played for a quick five minutes. I'm thinking of putting up Braid to show the GREAT qualities in the gaming industries (they can just start a new game every time someone new comes up), and something like a FPS (maybe left 4 dead?) to show violent games...

Any ideas? They have to be laptop games too.

~~Edit: The expo is over!! I will post pics hastily taken at the end of the expo, so please excuse my goofy look, and post a better update. Thank you all so much for your information! I will also tell you guys which games were chosen and hopefully reply to all of the comments.~~

This makes people think they were genuinely developing the game, then at some point during the alpha they lost motivation and wanted to disappear from the scene without refunding their customers, and did so pretending they were robbed.

It may not be the case as only one of the developers disappeared so far, but the official forums and site are still there.

This got me thinking, does this ""customers are investors"" business model really work?

I know this method helps indie developers who can't afford to go looking for publishers (Mojang being the first one that comes to mind), but shouldn't developers look into other ways of funding themselves other than taking preorders? For instance why don't they take loans?

Games tend to have this sorta, one-event feel to them. No one ever stops to sleep, there aren't multiple days in most cases, etc. The entirety of bioshock infinite took place in roughly 15 hours, but I feel like it could have taken 3 maybe 4 times that easily and still kept everyone enthralled the entire time.

I guess what I'm getting at is, why do devs feel the need to fit their game into this 20-30 hour goal? (unless it's an RPG, for some reason those are exempt), I feel like games like Bioshock Infinite, where the player is truly a part of the world, could go on 3x as long as it does.

I read this article about the new Fire Emblem's ""support conversation"" system. It honestly sounds really cool. I haven't heard any complete explanations so far of what it offers, but I really like the thought if it. 

It's basically a system of talking after battle that allows you to form bonds with the other characters in the game. Add that with this game's permadeath and if you ask me, this is an extremely unique approach to telling an emotional story.

The reason I'm so interested in this is because just a few days ago I was thinking about how fans of XCOM like to talk about how much the game offers the players a story for each one of their soldiers. [e.g. My Sergeant Jones died in combat, but was able to take two aliens out for  Private Harry so that he could target the alien about to attack him.] (Keep in mind that I've never played XCOM before, so I wouldn't know if my dramatization is completely correct.)

These stories sounded really cool, and probably keep a good emotional connection between the player and the characters in-game, which sounded really cool to me. As a result, that got me to thinking about a game where the characters aren't just famous for what they did in battle, but also have backstories, which further empowers what they do in battle and your feelings when they die. I was also thinking about character relationships as well and chemistry that you can build between characters by putting them together. I was also thinking about programming a game where I could experiment with these ideas.

Then, I'm looking through this month's GameInformer, and **BOOM**. There it was, my idea, in Fire Emblem: Awakening. In that game, you can build up relationships, have kids that can soon fight alongside you, gain perks from relationships, etc.  That's when I got excited. This could re-invent the way a lot of game plots are done if it's done right. 

Maybe I could be exaggerating, has any game before done something like this? The ability to form relationships with other characters who can permanently die at any time due to your own error, combined with perks from those relationships, while everyone has their own unique back-story? This is just fantastic to me. Does anybody else feel the same way about this? Any thoughts about what you believe they should add? Or what should be excluded?

Unfortunately, my workspace is also my gaming station. I've moved my keyboard and mouse down to a tray underneath my desk, limiting the space I have to move my mouse around. Basically, I went from a modest 10''(25cm) or so wide mousepad to &lt; 6""(15cm) mousepad. On top of that, I can't really use my mouse bungee down there. In order to play high precision fps games I have to take out my old mousepad, move my keyboard down to my lap, and deal with a small 10"" mousepad and cable tension. I know the best move would be to get one of those monster size mouse pads and find a low profile cable management system, but I'd really like to have the convenience of not having to move everything around when I want to to game, and again when I want to get up and take a break. 

I've been considering getting a trackball mouse or controller. I've never used a trackball mouse, so I'd like to hear from anyone who has some experience with using a trackball for work or gaming. How precise can you be with a trackball? Are certain types of shots/cursor movements more difficult? I've seen two main types of designs, one for thumb movement and one for finger movement. What are the advantages of each?

While doing some research about trackballs for gaming, I stumbled onto this [controller](http://www.tenfoldgames.com/revolvecontroller/about.php). It seems like having a setup like this(one joystick and one trackball) would make fps and rts gaming a lot more enjoyable for console gamers. Is there a reason why, despite all the obsession over creating new input devices, that there hasn't been any interest in creating a trackball console controller? I realize there are modders/unofficial controllers which do have trackballs on console, but there hasn't been any official support that I know of.

For example, MOBA (DOTA clones / ARTS / whatever) game communities are notorious for being incredibly hostile.

Why is that?

Several points indicate that this hostility stems from and is inherent to the genre, unless developers and mature community members commit to concious effort to improve it.

Things about your generic MOBA:

1. It is an online PVP game so the main point is to be better than other people.  
2. Usually a global rating is present, so every loss has long time consequences.  
3. It is real time and quite fast-paced, so the emphasis is on ""skill"" (twitch reflexes and decision making on the fly), the quality online gamers usually take pride in.
4. Despite the fast pace, matches take a long time, let's say half hour each.  
5. There's a huge amount of caveats that are not obvious to a newbie but incredibly important. Example: lasthitting instead of pushing. For those who do not play DotA clones: It's a tug-o-war. In order to win the game, you need to destroy towers. To do that, you need to kill enemy creeps first, that is called pushing. Pulling the tug. However, early on you should NOT pull the tug for a lot of reasons, and if you pull the tug and the enemy doesn't, they win. It makes no sense until you understand the reasons, and that takes practice.
6. There's an emphasis on teamplay, so you usually can't win games on your own unless you are much better than most players on *both* teams.
7. Seriously, there is such a thing as ""it's your fault we lost"". Unlike team shooters where the millstone gets killed but then you win, a bad player here can throw the game without knowing it.
8. Due to [Dunning-Kruger effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) nobody will ever understand that they are the millstone on their team, or, more commonly, that the team's loss is, more or less, [a result of their mistakes snowballing into a giant ball of misery](http://www.nerfnow.com/comic/717).  
9. Due to how the genre works (half a minute of action followed by minutes of waiting) you always have plenty of time to tell other players all the ways in which they suck.
10. Due to how popular the competitive scene is, everyone tries to emulate the top players' skill orders, item choices and so on, disregarding the situation, and flame their teammates when they do not follow cookie cutter strategies. Note that for a new player there is no way to distinguish between something that is just popular or something that is popular because it's actually a good choice.

TL;DR We have a genre where, if you lose, you have both lasting consequences *and* thirty minutes of your life down the drain, you can lose without actually it being your fault (although you can't tell if it's truly so, so everyone assumes it's simply not their fault), and you have plenty of time to flame people you don't like, and if you lose despite having enough skill to pass, the weakest link in your chain is likely the player who's too new to have enough knowledge. Thus, hostility towards everything and everyone, especially new players.",,False,,t5_2sgq6,1344213284.0,,,True,t3_xq3eb,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/xq3eb/lets_discuss_the_ways_in_which_some_gaming/,

You know what I mean? Some games are clunky, they sort of feel awkward (they can still be fun mind you) but the best games have ""good"" or a ""right"" feeling to it. The better the feel of a game, the more the interface between you and the game seems to dissolve away, and it feels like you're directly controlling it rather than pressing buttons to control it.

I haven't been able to put my finger on it but I think it's a combination of factors: high framerate, low latency controls, maybe something about character physics, especially in FPS and platformers. For third person games I think animation comes into play - a characters feet pushing on the ground instead of sliding, for example. And consistency in art style helps... plus things like FOV, maybe? 

Maybe it's better to try to list games that people consider ""feel"" right. Quake 3 comes to mind, Super Mario Bros nailed it pretty well, too. STALKER didn't feel right, though I got over it. Dead Space felt great (once I turned off vsync).

And if they do, what do you think it is needed for them to mature? Here is my opinion. 



The first Matrix is a great example. An oridinary man minding his own business is taken by extraordinary events which pushes him to his limits and even beyond. Pretty much everyone likes the movie. As a viewer it is easy to connect with Neo as he is vulnerable. But do to the extreme events he is capable in great achievements.


Now the second Matrix is the complete opposite. Neo is inhumanly strong and there is no room for character build or any emotions. Nothing that Neo does in the second movie, no matter how epic his action is, achieves the same emotional level as him barely dodging the bullets for the first time. And sadly this is the place where every game starts. 


I watch E3 press conferences and every third word is EPIC. Epic this epic that, everything is pushed to the max. I read through reddit and i see posts how people want to play their Star Wars games, and there is a pic of Dart Vader with huge explosion behind him. Looking at game posters or fan art, every character are in ridiculous poses with no hint of taste. An interview of a game developer is in the tv and he is asked if all the games are already invented. He says ""Yes, it is now just about perfecting these game."" Even some one in GT.com/Invisible Walls asked when COD3 got some bad comments ""Well what could they do better in COD3 as everything is already as big as it can be?"" Also i love Mass Effect but why does commander Shepard have to be an ultimate space marine? I would be more interested how he got to the point where he is in the begining than the rest of the game.


I feel like games are like movies at the time when everything was overacted. Or like the loudness war with music. There is no dynamic range in gaming experiences. The only games that still kind of work are RPGs as they let the gamer somewhat deside the pace.


For a long time the reason for ""bad story telling"" was because there were no good facial animations. Bad animations-&gt; no emotions. Now i hope that through Avatar and LA Noires technology this problem can be beaten. Other reason could be the clumsy way of interacting physically in the gaming world, your gun being the only thing to interact with. This is where i think Kinect and Wii U could make a big difference. 


Quick example: You sit next to a pond in game. For some reason you would like to touch the water and see it ripple. With a controller you can pressa X to interact with water -&gt; lose interest. With mouse you can click LMB and move your mouse -&gt; little better but still lose interest. With Kinect/Wii U controller in other hand you could actually touch the water with your fingers and interact with it. Now this was cool when iPhones came and might sound dull now but this actually opens a whole new door in to games. The choise to grab stuff with your hand of the game floor and interact with it. Throwing/touching/hitting stuff, interacting with DOOM3 -like interfaces buy using your hands. Tying your characters shoe laces the time he actually has legs instead of just a gun. A lot of cool but optional stuff could be done that now hapen with the ""interact"" button. This kind of stuff could be used a lot in pacing a game.


..But the thing still is that most gamers dont give a lot of concentration for games. As contrast to movies (especially in theaters) people shut down their phones and watch the movie in dark really try to immerse them selves. But for gaming its often lights on with friends at your house, skipping all the cutscenes trying to get to the game itself. This leading to the loudness war in games trying to fight over attention.


So were do all the subtleties disappear? Will we ever see games like the movies Taxi Driver/Reservoir Dogs. And will/when will gamers start to demand for more dynamic experienses? What does it demand from game developers and players to get more mature games? And if there is a professional game developer ever reading this, it would be interesting to hear what ""but this is not fun to play"" rules make my ideas not achievable? Would be nice to hear what you guys think of all this.

EDIT: 

Just trying to clarify something. I dont mean that i want games that are extremely complicated and not mainstream. I also dont mean that games should not have action and explosions like COD. Also when writing this down some great games came to mind like RDR, GTA IV, Heavy Rain, Alan Wake. But still these games so easily lose the element of suspension by giving too much. 

When i hear about a Star Wars game i imagine how it would feel like living on another planet filled with stuff and sound from SW universe. And then going to adventure where i might see a actual jedi doing what he does best. But no, the trailer is like straight from Call of Duty. Im still waiting for a game where i would be scared to fire a pistol because of the sound and damage it makes. And i still wait for a game where i could walk in to a bar in a rainy night without game developers thinking ""oh my god he is losing interest, quick put some explosions and aliens there"". These kind of interesting worlds are of course really hard to make without good facial animations and interesting (Kinect/WiiU) ways to interact with the world (like flushing a toilet and throwing poop.. just joking). 

And all this doesnt just mean fps games. I would love a driving game where i would really feel like driving an Aston Martin on some windy road at a cloudy autumn day. Like really make it look/sound/feel like you where there. No racing, no nitros and blue fire from the exhaust pipes. No avalances or helicopters dropping bombs. I dont mean everything needs to be real/sim. Just find the elements that make some experience amazing and make those elements great. 

Its like in the morning when your alarm clock and all the sounds sound so fing loud, but in a night club there is a point where the music can go louder but you dont hear it louder. The pacing and style in games are wrong in my opinion, and even when right, the games start where the player is already at the end of his development (like Neo in second Matrix). Because everything has to be ""epic"". I bet this is the reason why 90% of gamers dont finish their games as there is no interesting development.

Description of the graph (math): 

Review scores, x, are partially lumped together to smooth out the presentation (since they started getting into 1/10ths between 9-10). The rounding is roughly x±0.5. At 0, it includes scores x&lt;0.5. Since 10 is a perfect score, I left it on its own. Scores at 10 represent x = 10; the interval underneath it is 9.5≤x&lt;10. You can't see it well, but in the past 1 year, 0 games have received 10/10; in the past 2 years, 4 games have received 10/10.

The y-axis represents the percentage of total reviews receiving the respective score.

I also included a normal distribution for reference. I'm not implying that the scores *should* resemble a normal distribution, but I just included it because it seemed like the most basic and easily-accessible comparison.

One thing to note is the sharp increase in proportion of scores receiving 9/10 and an overall, and pretty consistent decrease to proportion of scores 6 to 8 

Edit: [Hawk_Irontusk pointed it out](http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/19a1l5/after_some_posts_here_about_review_scores_i/c8mdbp1) that perhaps I should handle cross-platform reviews differently... I took the average of the subset and counted it as a single title:

When I play any game the first thing I do is see how the game runs on my computer. Moving Graphical settings up and down. How high can i set all of these settings and the game be playable. How low can i set them and the game look acceptable.  

I love it when I find a game that I can drop the setting so low it just looks like absolute shit.. but now I can run it on some 8 year old crap laptop when I travel.. I really love those games.  

I love the games that look totally brilliant at medium settings and run smooth as butter.. and give you more to look forward to when you come back to them 2 years later with a better video card.  

I love the games that look beautiful no matter what the graphics are set to the game If yu have ever played FF11 and dropped EVERYTHING to it's lowest setting you will know what i mean.. DOTA2 uses a very similar effect for lowered graphics.  

Anyways what I wanted to ask.. Are there games that may not have the best graphics, but yo find them good because it meets certain ""Objective"" points on your list and thus they are ""good""  

Or games that are veyr good looking, but do not meet certain criteria and thus you judge them to be bad graphics?  

EDIT: Just to clarify my question. I am not saying whether a game is good or bad based on graphics.. I hate FFXI.. I think it is a stupid game. Boring and all that Jazz.. but I love it's graphics engine.. i wish most games used a similar engine. It looks very good. It ages well cause it is stylized and it will run on a system with 512MB of RAM and an intel GMA.  

I love Terraria and Minecraft, but I am disappointe din their graphical performance.. not appearance.. Just performance.. I expect minecraft and Terraria to run like butter on the shittiest system I can throw at them... I understand why they do not. Please do not think I am bashing them. they both look amazing and are amazing games.. but I feel both should be running twice as well as they do.

On one side, they serve to make the player cautious and careful, planning every move they make to make the escorting easier. On the other side, escorts can be one of the worst modes of gameplay, especially when the AI has the intelligence of a lobotomized chihuahua, and we're stuck babysitting the fuckwad. 

There are games that do this well. **Resident Evil 4**'s Ashley was competent enough to understand that hiding in the trash bin was probably the best way for her to survive a firefight. **Ico** was a hauntingly beautiful story where you had to lead Yorda out of the clutches of the Queen. And I really, really want **Bioshock: Infinite** to do this well. I am crossing my fingers at this point.

There are games that tend to give migraines. **Amy** was simply broken, especially when if you tried to hide her, she would *run towards monsters*. **Dead Island**'s residents seem so confident in their abilities that they charge headfirst into a monster horde with nothing but the clothes on their backs. **Bioshock 2** had those annoying parts where you had to protect the Little Sister from hordes of splicers as she would slowly drain Adam. Fuck.

So you're wondering where I'm going with this. See, recently, I read manga called *The Right Way to Make a Baby* (it's Japanese guys, it's alright!). The premise was that the main character was visited by a man in the future, who told the protagonist that if he did not marry his childhood friend, then all humanity will be doomed. Basically, there's a gene inside him that will mutate and develop into a deadly disease, but if he marries his childhood friend, then her genes will cancel out his and all will be sunshine and flowers. So the protagonist has to go around, avoiding getting aroused by women all around him while the man from the future protects him from advances from a future pharmaceutical corp who employs super powers and........I did mention this was Japanese, right?

Simply put, the main protagonist is the one being escorted.

It got me to thinking, are there games that put players in a vulnerable position and depend on the AI to protect him? I did find some examples, both good (**Half Life 2: Episode 1** where all you have is a flashlight and Alyx with infinite ammo) and bad (basically **Infinite Undiscovery**'s beginning, which made me return the game the next day because it was just so bad). But we haven't actually had a game that put players in a state of vulnerability, causing them to rely on NPC's for protection.

Now, I can see why we don't get games like this. Firstly, AI really needs to step it up. Maybe if more developers followed the Valve model of making memorable NPC's with competent actions, but most of the time AI is just shit waffles in games. Second, people play games to feel powerful, to feel strong, to feel like the hero of the story. But what about horror games? Those definitely put you in a state of vulnerability (well, except **Dead Space**, which I am pretty sure is more action than horror). Recently we had **Spec Ops: The Line** that indicted these power-centric ideas in gaming. And I'm sure we can somehow make the gameplay engaging.

Say, like, you are an archeologist who needs to decipher runes, and you hire mercenaries, bought by money from excavations, that you place in strategic locations to defend yourself from bandits, soldiers, and mummies. It's like a combination of a puzzle game and a strategy game!

World of Warcraft: Burning Crusade, I’m looking at you…

We’ve all felt that sting of defeat, then wave of euphoria as we discover new items for our characters in games.  Be it the Ultima Weapon, Cluckeye, or something that makes the game turn into your personal bitch.  But with all of these choices, and some titles that make it utterly impossible to find the end game gear, doesn’t that leave us with a feeling of incompleteness?

Diablo 3 is the most recent example of the never-ending gear quest, replacing rares for other rares with minimal stat increases between gloves, boots, weapons, etc.  You can grind for hours, which people do including myself, and find nothing to progress your character further.  But the moment you do, you link it in your party chat and try to /dance only to find they stopped that ability.  Apparently, there is no dancing in Sanctuary.  But the point here is that people will grind for days to find better and better gear, either to sell or wear and grind with further.  It is a reoccurring loop that keeps the gaming being played and enjoyed on some level.

Borderlands is another example of how the never-ending search for the best gear can turn a casual shooter into a scour for hours.  Spending about a full week’s time with Borderlands, I never even got to see pearlescent weapons (a glitch in the gun generation code that would make common weapons have phenomenal stats) after they patched it into the game.  The grind against the super-secret boss was almost impossible for me, being that I was the Soldier class and it usually takes a Siren to effectively take it down.  But even then, I grinded bosses, DLC, and everything in between because the game’s premise was addicting.  That new shotgun with acid rounds that shot more accurate than a sniper rifle could always be right around the corner.

And in that idea of the best being always rarely attainable, that is where players like to lose themselves in the grind.  In games like EverQuest and World of Warcraft, you have prestige or ranks of items that you have to literally spend weeks or even months to obtain.  Those items show off that you were good enough to acquire said gear and they may also provide a bonus to your character more so than regular items you would come across in the wild.  That’s two for two in the eyes of gamers that like to show off their guns.

But is this a framing of game style that catches on to the casual player?

I personally think not.  Casual players, the ones who would spend about 10 hours a week on video games, aren’t the ones running raid groups or spending time with friends in dungeons for hours on end.  That takes a lot of time to invest, and the rewards for the time put in aren’t that appealing to some.  I can say I have never been in a raid, even though I purchased WoW on it’s release and every subsequent expansion.  I never invested the time it would take to become “good enough” to be able to do those things.  I always puttered out of the game until new word came that new things were on the horizon that I could see myself enjoying.  Plus, I was a terrible Undead Warrior.

But could this work for a system that didn’t demand your time and attention similar to a full-time job?

Yes.

Look at games like FarmVille or the newly released Simpsons: Tapped Out.  These are games that require minimal supervision to succeed and it is a constant grind for money and experience for better things that would earn you money and experience.  I personally have played Tapped Out and for the few first days, I was hooked.  Knowing when my timers would pop so I could efficiently doll out cash to then invest in characters to do different chores to attain more and more stuff.  But I became bored with the mentality of “hurry and wait”, when I could be doing something else with my time.  Now, that time may have only been 15-20 minutes every four to eight hours, but I still feel like that is more of a drain than just taking that time to farm for items in D3.

You can say that the grind in many games is a dull and almost chore-like cycle of brain-melting gameplay.  I would agree, I caught myself almost drooling while grinding Act 1 Inferno last night while talking and playing with friends.  But it is that same mentality that envelops many gamers into making money for those kinds of games.  Gold Farming and Power Leveling are some of the services that you can buy right now for titles like D3, WoW, and other MMO-styled games.  The grind isn’t always appealing and if you only have the casual time to spend on gaming and the cash to back up that investment, you can play with the end-game content and go for the prizes that would normally take that long haul to achieve.  With games coming out with the never-ending grind like Guild Wars 2, Torchlight 2, The Elder Scrolls Online, and Balder’s Gate, it doesn’t seem like the zombie hordes of gamers are anywhere close to being done with the hours of grinding ahead of them.

Now if you’ll excuse me, I need to see how my auctions are doing and play with my Level 3 Paragon Barbarian named Huxley.",,False,,t5_2sgq6,False,,,True,t3_yupvy,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/yupvy/theres_always_something_better_the_neverending/,

PC Gaming is what many people think of when the Pinnacle of Gaming Trophy is up for grabs.  Where console and handheld fall short is where the PC gaming community takes root.  That small crevice between you enjoying the game and adding your own fun to the game is the PC Modding Community.

This is a highly motivated group of people that change digits, items, textures, creatures, or even entire campaigns to better accommodate their vision of how the game could or should be.  They don’t care what the intended release for a game was, if they get their hands on something that is fully supported with Mod development.  From Skyrim to the original Quake, modding has been a staple of PC gaming since one of the first real PC titles came into the public eye with Wolfenstein 3d.  People made mods that involved Batman, the Cold War, and even the television personality, Barney (a child-appealing purple dinosaur).  From then on, the PC gaming market has been a melting pot of ideas, stories, and even differentiating gaming mechanics than what the game was originally intended for.

Look at Warcraft III, a Real-Time Strategy title from Blizzard that the modding community turned on it’s face.  Using tweaks with the game itself, they were able to discover a game genre previously untapped within the PC market, that mod/title being Defense of the Ancients (or DotA as it is usually called).  This was a game, created by original supporters of Warcraft and spun into a completely different title, complete with separate characters and interest from the gaming community.  This is one of the many different ways that the modding community alters a game outside of it’s original scope of being.

But why does the modding community do this?  Are they not happy with the original product given to them from hours upon hours of work from the developer?

The answer is both yes and no.

Yes, as in, they do enjoy the game enough to purchase it on it’s own merit and enjoyment. Few gamers buy games they don’t want to use for the intended product, unless they’re more interested in the modding community than the actual game itself (See also: Garry’s Mod).  But with that obvious statement, you get into more complexities of the PC gamer to follow it up with a No as well.  In a world of complete customization for the user of a PC, where you can adjust your Mouse drag by millimeters and make your PC chassis look like it came from a sci-fi aquarium, you want to make sure that if you have the best tool to run a game that the game runs the best it can.  Sifting through the available mods for games like Quake, Skyrim, Fallout 3, Dwarf Fortress and others show a lot of mods based on graphics and updating the interface for a more pleasant experience.  Some get more ambitious with full clothing and weapon upgrades that weren’t originally available in the game, more realistic weather and environmental patterns, and completely overhauling a specific thing such as water interaction and reflection to make sure that when you look down into your kingdom’s pool, you can see your beautifully vain and High-Definition character’s face looking back at you.

Some people want to adjust everything in a game so they know they are getting the best part of their money.  Why hate a mod that enhances the facial expressions of NPC’s to make them look more realistic rather than a porcelain doll from 1960?

That is the basic mantra for the modding community.

If there is a rule for a certain game, they are the ones to wonder why it’s there and then bend or shatter it.

These groups are quite ambitious as well, spanning many months or even years to bring a designated product to users hands.  Looking at some mods like in Starcraft II with the raid-like World of Warcraft mod or Day-Z for the ARMA II games, you see a branching effect that makes games have new and unintentional factors that modders expose and provide to the community as a whole.  But is it worth it to provide content to a game that many people say is dead?

The answer is almost a unified yes, looking into the ways that Steam has opened it’s doors for modders in the Steam Workshop.  The Steam Workshop is a platform within the Steam client that allows a hierarchy system for adopted mods in specific games like Skyrim, Dungeon Defenders, and most notably Team Fortress 2.  With this, modders can sell their additional weapons, hats, or other add-ons to users willing to pay for it.  Not everything changes the game, but those that do are taken through the herds of other players and funneled by a voting system to see what people want implemented into their games.  This allows a modding community to thrive and provide better upgrades or additions to content by going through a business cycle, but free modding communities don’t have that.  What is their motivation to do all of this?

For the good of the game and the good of their name.

People want to see their creations supported and played by all gamers, just as much as a development team wants to see their brainchild in the hands of players everywhere.  Modders have that same feeling and do what they do for the passion of the work, and also for money but that is harder to generate if it is being distributed freely with such stuff as Left4Dead 2 Campaign mods.

Modding is a way of life for many PC gamers and console gamers aren’t in the loop.  As time progresses, perhaps the console community will have the ability to expand itself as it’s own content-generating culture.  But for now, I’ll be playing with Nazi Dinosaurs in a cybernetic holy war in Half-Life 2 mods on my PC named GlaDOS.",,False,,t5_2sgq6,False,,,True,t3_yfu6w,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/yfu6w/pc_modding_breaking_all_the_things_you_never/,

1335333627.0,95,self.truegaming,srdbz,"Shadow of the Colossus PS2/PS3 gameplay comparison 
or: How I learned to stop hating Gaius and love the 
game. (x-post from /r/TeamIco)",NAME_inallcaps,123,28,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/srdbz/shadow_of_the_colossus_ps2ps3_gameplay_comparison/,"DISCLAIMER: I don't make video games. I have a rudimentary understanding of the technical side. I really like Shadow of the Colossus and I've looked up just about as much as I could to write this. Sorta :]

I've seen a lot of comments on GameFAQs and YouTube videos about the physics change in the HD remake of Shadow. As I don't have a PS3 myself and have only played the PS2 version of Shadow, I decided to watch various YouTube videos and figure out if the HD remake is actually ""broken"".

The main complaint is that Wander simply loses grip much more than he used to. I discovered this when looking up tips on how to beat Gaius (#3) in Hard Time Attack. ([Doing the crazy sword-to-head launch became a pretty fun thing to try.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x79Fo97y1yU&amp;t=3m25s)) But, apparently, on the PS3 version, Wander just cannot hold on to Gaius' midsection long enough to make full stabs.

Here is a link to a video showing the original PS2 Gaius run (timestamped to the midsection sigil): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epOWzl2KOnQ&amp;t=4m31s

Note that Wander loses grip only a few times.

And here's a video of Gaius on the PS3 remake (again, timestamped to the midsection): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtwXoh5X0Os&amp;t=10m8s

Constantly losing grip. Butterfingers.

This is usually where the conversation ends. Most people saw this and got really angry at the game. What was once fun to them is now broken. Beating Gaius on HTA became near impossible. Players had to find exploits in Gaius' defensive animations to attack the midsection with little to no interruption: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmQ395LhIvQ&amp;t=1m14s (Making him jostle his sword so he is bent over, making his midsection bunch up and move much less.)

But then there's this. A video from 2010 of the PS2 version being emulated on a PC. Smooth framerate and all that jazz. All that's missing is the increased FOV and HD textures: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUdrFkW1RY8&amp;t=4m26s

Losing grip about as much as in the PS3 remake. Hmm.

Shadow of the Colossus was originally made to run at 30 frames per second. On the PS2 version, on a good day, it ran between 20-30 when riding on Agro through the wilderness and about 15-20 during colossus battles. If anything can be concluded from this, it's that the skipped frames in the PS2 version were actually making it easier to play. Gaius' midsection would animate in such a way that it would trigger a loss in grip. When the framerate drops, a frame that once triggered a loss in grip is now skipped. In a way, Wander losing grip and ragdolling about like a ninny seems to be the authentic way to experience it.

What it seems like is the PS3 version wasn't fully tested. They focused on just getting the textures cleaner and making sure it played to their liking. Had it gone through more testing cycles, maybe they would've come across this issue and either altered how the grip worked or adjusted the HTA times accordingly. But this doesn't really fall on the shoulders of Team Ico. From what I understand, they oversaw the project while Bluepoint Games was in charge of the port.

Here's a playlist for the PS2 version being emulated on a PC in HD. You can go through each colossus battle and see how similar they are to the PS3 remake: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL894C9468F2597100&amp;feature=plcp",,False,,t5_2sgq6,False,,,True,t3_srdbz,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/srdbz/shadow_of_the_colossus_ps2ps3_gameplay_comparison/,

I'm talking since the SNES days, and everything afterward. Sticking to the numbered games, I don't think I've played one that didn't instantly captivate me and become one of my favourite games of all time. We all know FF7,8,9,10,12 are kings among the crowd.

But here is my beef. I just finished FF13-2, on PS3, platinum trophy and everything (hold your applause). And I had quite a lot of fun. I thought it was funner on an hourly basis than 13. And then I borrowed Chrono Trigger on DS from my girlfriend, and I got mad.

I got mad because it is a way better game. For reasons I didn't think a company like Square Enix could forget. Final Fantasy has always been story driven, but until the recent few games, you could control the pace of the story to your liking. Now, of the ~50 hours put into the game, a huge chunk of that is watching movies, which don't need to be there. The novelty of being able to read text was something I never thought I would miss until the industry evolved. Reading character dialogue lets the player create their own voices, even personalities, furthering the RPG experience. In the new games, you are given characters, who are always flat, and they tend to annoy more than entertain. Not to pick on 13 and its sequel, but why not just have NPC's and characters talk to you while in the game? Instead they are non-stop cuts to 10-second movies, with a loading screen on both sides of it. Utterly ridiculous.
In Chrono Trigger, you can talk to people while you move around! You don't even have to stop to talk. And even in the old FF games, you could read at your pace and bail whenever you wanted. I guess it makes me upset because when Squeenix says they can't recreate a game like FF7 on current-gen systems, I think their idea of what needs to be changed is vastly different than what the gamers want. In that case, I don't want to hear Cloud's voice which will certainly sound a lot different than the voice my brain has created for him.

What are your thoughts on this? Where do you think the industry is heading to? What are your favourite games in the series and why?

TL;DR - New FF games are so story-depth focused that they are more of a movie than a game.

The post included pics of a very interesting game, the .hack series : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.hack_(video_game_series)

The game, in my mind, was incredible. I played it as a child, the basic idea being that you were a person playing in a game that was mysteriously putting people into comas. However, the in game universe seemed, to me, appealing. I always wanted to have a discussion on it, but most children, when I had finished playing the first game, had never heard of it. Even now most people do not recognize it, even after it was a semi-popular show on adult-swim. 

The basic idea of the game within the game was your normal MMORPG experience. However, as all MMORPGs do, it had its own twist. There were basic town hubs(called Root Towns) where different potions, weapons, etc. could be purchased. Fake characters could be traded with to get bigger and stronger weapons. These, ofc, would be normal people in game. To fight creatures and explore one had to go to a  Chaos Gate found in each Root Town. Combinations could be put together indicating what you would encounter in your random environment. You would then be ported to an area equipped with both an outdoor and dungeon environment, both equipped with monsters. 
 
Dungeons could be entered and explored. At the ""end"" of each dungeon was a treasure chest with the most valuable of items. Many dungeons were labyrinth-like, and made getting to the end quite a feat. Also people could post meetings at various locations for quests. Many dungeons, as part of the game, would have large bosses in them.

My question is, ""Could a game Like this ever be do-able?"" 
Would this game style be one that one would be enjoyable?

.hack//fragment was the online version of this game, only being played in japan and only open for roughly 2 years, from 2005-2007. That, one would say, should be enough to show that it isn't a good game style as it didn't work out. However, the game style given there wasn't truly perfected, with people having to enter ""lobby's"" to go on adventures and couldn't truly go throughout the world randomly meeting others. I feel as if it could've been perfected. If it was, would you play it?

Played through it multiple times, felt like almost everything about it worked for the atmosphere, and felt that the elements shed from previous titles worked in its favor. Even things like the hammy dialogue, stopping to shoot, and organizing your inventory all the time felt fine in context. One of my favorite Gamecube games, hands down.

Fast forward to 5, everything seems to be pretty much in place: same shooting mechanics, similar inventory, a likable protagonist and a cool villain, along with an apparent continuation of the Plagas storyline, which I actually enjoyed quite a bit. Yeah, it was in a mostly well-lit setting, but it couldn't be that different in terms of enjoyability, right?

I can't really pin down exactly what happened. Maybe it was the coop, which was hard to set up but annoying to play without, but for whatever reason, the game was not scary in the slightest, was incredibly frustrating, and never once gave me the feeling of enjoyability that 4 gave me. I even went back and played 4 to make sure I wasn't wearing nostalgia glasses, but it was still just as good. What exactly went wrong?

The first page and a half at least were people saying that the effects of piracy are impossible to quantify and then pulling a bunch of meaningless numbers out of their asses.

And then we have Ubisoft.

*""It's impossible to know how bad piracy is,"" agrees Michael Pachter, Wedbush Morgan analyst, ""but it's pretty bad. Ubisoft told me that their PC game sales are down 90 per cent without a corresponding lift in console sales. Some of the decline is truly due to people migrating to consoles, but my guess is that 40 to 50 per cent of PC games played are not purchased.""* 

The publisher with arguably the most restrictive DRM in the industry has seen a massive drop in sales yet still blames it on piracy.

Is there no winning with these people? If a PC game flops commercially it's almost universally attributed to piracy. If said game had little or no DRM, it flopped because of piracy. If, like Ubisoft, your games have incredibly restrictive DRM yet still flop it's because of piracy. It's much easier to blame a scapegoat like piracy than to admit that your game has faults.

So is there anything else that can be done, or are we doomed to repeat this cycle forever? When the subject of DRM comes up, almost always one of the top comments is to, ""Vote with your wallet. Don't buy the game, don't pirate it."" Which is good advice, yet seems meaningless. If enough people take this advice and don't buy the game, the loss of sales will still be blamed on piracy.

",ratatatatatata,148,52,135,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/k2bqz/why_i_didnt_like_deus_ex_human_revolution/,"...or at least not as much as most of the people.

Before we go, I would like to say that I have not played the first one to the end, and will do asap.

The main problem I have with the game is that it is really dumbed down compared to the original. (I have not played Invisible War at all)

* First of all, what may seem a minor thing, is the lack of locks. Everything has some electronic keylock that you can hack. Why is this a big thing? Because we lose one potential spec path. You will not be wasting points on locks, everything will go towards hacking. And if you get Level 5 Hacking Skills you can go everywhere.

* Another thing is the whole specialization mindset of the game is gone. Firstly, there are no weapon specs, you just get upgrades, which you are pretty much bombarded with, and on top of that, you can buy. Secondly, the game tells you do be careful how you spend your Praxis Points, while at the same time throwing them at you constantly, espacially if you are a hacker. If you get maximum hacking you get 75 XP per hacked sofware +additional bonuses + occasional award ""L33t Skillz"" + 200 XP (which is basicly like the ""Scholar"" award, you hack X number of devices and get XP). Add the Traveler award for finding secret areas which are found easily, just think to yourself ""Does the objective wants me to go there?"" if the answer is ""No"", they you will get some free XP and some items. (BTW, you get so much XP in Hengsha just by opening the doors at the back of the stores). At the end of the game I had almost all the upgrades, the ones I didn't get were Cloaking, because sneaking is way too easy as is, even on ""Give Me Deus"" difficulty, the enchanced radar, because it actually makes it harder to work with the radar, everything becomes so tiny, hacking fortify and analyze, because you get so much worms and nukes that you don't need em. Overall, I wanted them to make it more complex, kinda like Vampire The Masquerade, like Planescape, yet they made it simpler.

* Another problem I have with the game is the lack of reaccuring characters. For instance, in Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines, the woman you (can) turn to a ghoul appears later in the game and depending on what you have done till then, she reacts in different ways. And the whole game is like that, you do something bad to someone, it will come and bite you in the ass. You do something good for someone? Someone else will be angered and will be angry with you.
Deus Ex: Human Revolution lacked this kind of depth. The story was too linear. Another flaw is that there were too like side quests, and they explained main story too little or didn't develop any characters at all. For instance, the quest about the Rogue Soldiers in the sewers, it is just thrown out there and nothing made out of it.

* Not so much a flaw but the main actor sounds kinda like Keanu Reeves and everytime I upgraded my suit I heard in my head ""I know kung fu"" ^^

I think this is all I didn't like in the game. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it and I think we will have another Deus Ex: GOTY edition. It is better thanmost of the games that are hitting the market nowadays, but it still has it's flaws. So.. what do you guys think? Is the game perfect? Am I just an elitist when it comes to games?

PS: There is too little ammo :/

1376079277.0,95,self.truegaming,1k1q71,Why is there so much hype about the Oculus Rift?,Acct4NonHiveOpinions,190,95,126,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1k1q71/why_is_there_so_much_hype_about_the_oculus_rift/,"A bit of a disclaimer: the following is just going to be my impression of how the gaming community has approached and views the Oculus Rift- if what I say doesn't resonate with your perception, feel free to talk a little bit about why not.

That said, I feel like the Oculus Rift often gets too much in the way of praise and hype. A lot of people herald it as the next big thing in the form of immersion, or the next big step in gaming*, but all I can see it for is a gimmick of a mechanic. Take for instance [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P50fvL_EWYY) video, where a lot of the reception is that it's too disorienting, too difficult to manage, and too inferior to just playing Team Fortress 2 with a keyboard and mouse. At the same time though, they seem to be praising it very highly, while not getting any significant gameplay from it! I will concede that this is probably because TF2 itself does not lend itself to highlighting the Oculus Rift as much as , perhaps, an exploration game or something much more casual. Dear Esther, for instance, would probably work very well in the Rift, but at the same time, the kind of people who would enjoy that are probably the same people who enjoy Dear Esther just on their monitor. 

I suppose, before I get too rambling, that my major gripe with the Oculus Rift is the emphasis it puts on ""immersion"" into a game, but this is only one aspect (and in my opinion, a minor one compared to some of the other things games can do) of the strengths of video games. With ""immersion"" as its only apparent (to me) selling point, it starts to come across less like the next Wii and more like a fancy expensive gimmick that will be purchased by people buying in to the hype, only to sit on dusty shelves after the first couple of hours of trying it.

Thanks for reading through this post. I feel like I have a lot of opinions about it, but it can be very hard to cohesively articulate everything I'm thinking at the moment. Feel free to ask questions and
talk with me a bit if you want to know more about what I'm trying to say about all this.

1361213650.0,88,self.truegaming,18rjwe,What would Mirror's Edge 2 benefit from having?,tigranater,120,32,132,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/18rjwe/what_would_mirrors_edge_2_benefit_from_having/,"Although there's been years of back and forth about creating a sequel to 2008's **Mirror's Edge**, EA has all but confirmed a sequel to the first-person platformer.

I'd like to show you this: http://youtu.be/cKPAt2d5i-g?t=9m4s

It's a playlist about the architecture of **Mirror's Edge**. While the creator does seem to unnecessarily rip on **Mirror's Edge**, he raises some important points both about the level design and the overall gameplay:

* **Level Design:** Although the city is pretty, there is no depth to the architecture. Buildings have no character and are shallow.

* **Gameplay:** For a game about free-running, there is no freedom.

----
----
[**Level Design**](http://header)


**Mirror's Edge** takes place in an unnamed utopian metropolis, filled with bold, solid colours clashing with a layer of surgically-white edifices. Although it can be argued that the city is rather a dystopian setting, most social conflict seems to have been eradicated; and rather the city is an exemplar of successful capitalism and high quality of life, brought to us through a complete sacrifice of liberties and freedom - so it's an interesting twist on usual *cyberpunk*.

Now taken as a whole, the city is pretty. There's a very clear motif of colours allocated to different districts present in the many views you can take in when traversing the rooftops. The buildings look... *nice*... organised and more or less aesthetically pleasing. When you look closer though, the city is actually quite bland and shallow: buildings have no character. They tell little about the city's history or the city's culture today.

There's almost no exposition about the city either (apart from a few cutscenes and a loose story), and that's fine. But you're expected to make up for that with an expression through architecture. 

**Dishonored** does this perfectly. You only need to look around you and you get an immediate gist of which realm you are in. Abandoned distilleries with Victorian-esque logos painted on the sides to be seen from across Wrenhaven River, a sunset sinking behind the row of riverside houses with massive ships carrying full size whales in the foreground: their oil powering a Victorian-esque city on the advent of an Industrial Revolution.



Yeah... you get none of that in **Mirror's Edge**. How can we deal with that? There's one simple thing that can do a world of good when it comes to creating fictional cities. *Signage*. Holographic billboards, iconic company logos perched onto unique skyscrapers, even street and shop signs.

Compare [this cityscape](http://i.imgur.com/Io1vrxc.jpg) of **Deus Ex: Human Revolution**  with [this one](http://ctrlclick.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/mirrors-edge-007.jpg) of **Mirror's Edge**.

Although by no means is **Mirror's Edge** completely without signage; the billboards are uninteresting and don't stand out, they come in too few and far between and they seem to be completely absent anywhere near ground level! Deus Ex is choc full with advertisements. They tell what kind of companies operate in the world, the concentration of billboards indicate the competiteveness of the economic character of the city. They instill an atmosphere - they are *mise-en-scène* meant to convey the setting of a near-future dystopian society.

Now only signage won't solve the problem, but it's a good first step. The city still lacks in interesting and unique architecture that tells us more about the ortgeist of our metropolis.

----
----

[**Gameplay**](http://header)

The video I linked earlier also talks about how the game lacks in freedom. For a game about free-running, he's right. You're given a city filled to the brim with wonderful potential, and you spend 90% of the game running from cops.

**Mirror's Edge 2** can benefit from being open-world. Now many people have said that an open-world ME2 would suffer from a lack of direction. This is a valid concern. Many semi-linear games would be worse off it the world is opened up. Story begins to suffer and unique level design loses its value when it is repeated constantly throughout a large playing are. But **Mirror's Edge** is a platformer where you acrobatically traverse an urban environment to get from point A to point B: in other words *parkour*.

This just begs for an open-world city. And I mean from the ground level all the way to the rooftops. Imagine how much more satisfied you'd be from completing your mission (which often involves getting somewhere dangerous while on hot pursuit by the police) by finding your own way to an objective. The game didn't tell you to climb this building and drop from this height. You decided to skip that altogether and take a much more interesting route: zip-lining from this skyscraper to another and springboarding yourself to the side entrance of your target building. I would gain much more of a sense of accomplishment as it was all my work.

In my opinion, ME2's optimal gameplay structure would be an open-world game: 

* Where story missions would still involve direction and coherence but let you craft your own solution to the problem.

* And side-missions involve the taking package X to location Y. After all, that's Faith's job right? We never see her doing that in the actual game, which is another thing I felt lacking in the game.

* And in between we would get to explore a vast city which at the moment is a blank canvas just screaming for an interesting setting to be painted on.

So, that's what I think **Mirror's Edge 2** would be benefit from having. What do you think?

Being an Iraqi soldier trying to kill American bad guys would quite honestly be a lot of fun, but not just for killing Americans. The reason why? It could make war games much more different as far as strategy is concerned. Perhaps it could give a more emotional, provocative story.

* A wealth of Weapons (57 total, each with two modes) from remote detonated mines to alien sniper rifles that could see through walls, to tranquilizer guns

* capacity to double wield one handed weapons.

* Status Effects that would affect the way your character moved and saw the world (from blinded to sedated to poisoned)

* Tons of Game Modes! (CTF, KotH, VIP, TD with two or more teams, FFA, Hold the Briefcase)

* BOTS! (the bots had multiple personalities that you could choose from as well as different difficulties, and you could use them while playing with friends

* 4 player split screen (with up to 9 extra bots if you so choose)

* Challenges that could be tackled with friends, and had rewards for doing so (unlocking new bot personalities, weapons and game play modes)

* player accounts and customization (you could customize your character, and the system would keep track of number of kills, bullets used, miles run, most effective weapon, least effective weapon, accuracy, and medals earned through out multiplayer)

* an interactive hub (the agency) that acted as a menu, with secret rooms, and weapon challenges that only helped immerse the player in the experience.

While no console game comes close in my opinion to this wealth of features, we have seen a growth in the story telling aspect of action/adventure games. with more interesting and adult Dramas such as Bioshock, The Line, and The Last of Us. this seems to be almost like a trade off, by simplifying the game features the developers are able to focus resources and player attention to other aspects of the game. I would like to believe that there are developers out there capable of creating the Wealth of features of games like perfect dark, paired with the deeper character development and world building of games like Dragon Age

Fast forward to today and im practically smashing my controller because I cant get a consistent winning streak up against the computer on Tekken Tag 2 to try and get a trophy.

I've just taken a step back and realised ever since CS I've probably ruined gaming for myself and even become a little bit OCD. 

The majority of the time I only enjoy games when I win. Any game that can be potentially played competitively I get way too serious about, other games such as GTA, Infamous, RDR etc. where I can free roam and do missions are fine but I seem to incapable of enjoying the likes of Tekken or Call of Duty.

I will try to be vague in my explanation, but I assume responses may delve deeper than I do initially. So be warned. 



I greatly enjoyed the story woven throughout Bioshock Infinite, but feel that it might have been better served by another game genre. Infinite had such an urge to tell a winding and complex story, (and with some effort and suspension of disbelief by the player, it certainly does) but found pacing issues and logistical problems that being tied to an FPS setting will bring to such a piece. 



These are a few issues I could find without being too plot specific or nit-picky. 
Being rushed from one scene to the next, Vigors being shoehorned into Columbia to keep Plasmid gameplay, announcements and plot points drown out by enemy encounters, and Voxophones being essentially critical to plot understanding. The last point doesn't bother me so much since I love me some exploration, but I can see a very large group of consumers head scratching over a lot of the nuances and events to come in the last act without finding a few specific recordings. 



Now I know that for the kind of deep and complex stories of Rapture and Columbia to ever see the light of day, and be profitable, they needed to be wrapped into FPS titles. Ken Levine has even admitted as much. But if you COULD change Bioshock into any genre other than a FPS which would it be, and why would that be the better execution? 


I would say an e-book to be clever, because god I would read this. But having this conversation with my friends we can't seem to find a way to convey the scenery and plot equally without the punch that first-person perspective brings to the table. 



TL;DR, in telling a great story I found Bioshock Infinite, in respect to its story, was held back by being an FPS. In your opinion could/would changing the genre alleviate this problem, or go further and even enhance the overall experience?

Since I'm always up for a discussion, I thought I'll post some of my thoughts here and see what you guys think and who knows, maybe I'll even get some valuable insight or new perspectives about the industry?

So, these are obviously very strange times for the gaming industry and that's especially true for mobile gaming. Just to be clear, mobile games refer to smartphone and tablet games.

The facts are:

- Vita is not nearly as popular as anyone thought it would be and that goes for both gamers' and developers' interest

- App Store and Google Play are growing like magic beans

- A lot of casual gamers that only play games on their phones and tablets are starting to show more profound interest in gaming

- More and more developers every year are turning to Android/iOS

- smartphones and tablets are rapidly growing in power and a lot of them today are more than capable of running virtually any game made for portable consoles

However:

- most of the said Android/iOS games lack complexity that 3DS and Vita titles have

- portable consoles still perform better because their primary purpose is to run games

- there is still a whole army of loyal fanboys (I'm not saying this in a negative context)

- developing games for portable consoles is a lot easier because you're (usually) optimizing the game for only one device

- a lot of gamers aren't interested in complex gaming experiences on their mobile devices and stick to their consoles/PC's

These of course aren't all of the arguments, but they are a starting point. Now, I'm not saying that handheld gaming will ever replace console and PC gaming, but I think there's a possibility that portable consoles won't exist in the future because mobile devices won't only be powerful enough to run virtually any game imaginable, but they'll also open a door to a much wider audience. 

I still don't have the numbers, but I'm pretty sure that the number of tablet owners is a lot bigger than the number of owners of portable consoles. Of course, unlike portable consoles owners, not every smartphone and tablet user is interesting in gaming, but I think that the divergence between the numbers is big enough to justify the developers' risk to completely abandon handheld consoles and focus on mobile devices.

Any thoughts are greatly appreciated, especially from devs and mobile gamers.

P.S. I haven't mentioned Windows Phone OS because I don't think it's relevant enough in gaming circles.

With film-to-game adaptations it seems like one part of the problem is that the tie-in games are often only meant to compliment the film and encourage people to see them - meaning that the games don't need to be big budget, and because of that often end up not being close to triple A titles. Another problem might be that the game will generally come out on the same date as the film, leaving no flexibility for the developers if the development is running behind schedule. In contrast, Goldeneye was a fantastic game, and that came out 2 years after the film; showing how it was always meant to be a standalone game based off the film rather than promoting it.

Game-to-film adaptations seem very different though. There certainly doesn't seem to a lack of budget for many of these films, for instance Angelina Jolie being in the Tomb Raider films, and Michael Fassbender recently being announced to play the main character in the upcoming Assassin's Creed movie (which I'm really hoping bucks the trend of game-to-film adaptations). I get the idea that maybe the problem is as simple as game storylines and mechanics just not being suited for movie adaptations. For instance, the best game-to-film adaptation (in my opinion) which I've seen is Prince of Persia, which was extremely different to games - it just happened to be a good movie on its own, even though it bore little resemblance to the game series (from what I can tell).

",NimhVahReaux,127,33,104,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/s24e0/what_really_constitutes_a_gimmick_and_an/,"In my travels across the yawning expanse of the internet, I have often seen games praised as being [""innovative""](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/innovation) in some respect, be it their gameplay, their physics engine, or their art style, though the area of praise is rarely specified. Likewise, I tend see games like Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword, The Gunstringer, and others described as [""gimmicks""](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/gimmick?s=t) and dismissed immediately.

To my eye, many people don't even realize what they are saying - they seem to think that all innovations are good and all gimmicks are bad, even though they clearly are not. Frankly, it has gotten to the point where I immediately have a lower opinion of those who use the words as reasons to like or dislike a game.

Let us examine motion controls, for instance, a frequent recipient of the derogatory meaning of ""gimmick."" Do they attract attention to something? Certainly. Is that a bad thing? Absolutely not, provided the execution is effective. Metroid Prime 3 and Skyward Sword took motion controls and used them in ways that, at least in my opinion, greatly contributed to immersion in the games' respective worlds and allowed a degree of control that would not have been feasible with standard controllers.

On the other side, let's look at morality systems, praised as ""innovative"" as early as Fable. The morality system, while certainly interesting, formed the focal point of the entire game, with shop prices, citizens' responses to your presence, your character's physical appearance, and the ending of the game all changing depending on your alignment. However, morality systems in most modern games since (with The Witcher series being a common refutation) seem to add them to produce a superfluous addition to the game, perhaps adding a new wrinkle or two (Renegade/Paragon interrupts in the Mass Effect series) to continue to lay claim to the title of ""innovative,"" when really a new coat of paint and a different set of tires have been thrown on the proverbial storytelling vehicle.

In short, I raise these questions: 

* Are all innovations good?

* Are all gimmicks bad?

* Where can a line be drawn to separate the two?",,False,,t5_2sgq6,False,,,True,t3_s24e0,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/s24e0/what_really_constitutes_a_gimmick_and_an/,

I was the leader of the biggest PvP guild on my server leading up to Cataclysm. I stopped playing because maintaining a guild, as well as keeping up to date with each new season of gear (and each new tier of raid gear) was far too much work, when all I wanted to do was pit my skills against other players.

I started playing Starcraft 2 about a year ago and genuinely enjoyed the experience. You and your opponent start on even ground, with even resources and everything after that is down to skill. The same can be said of the WoW area server, which is only up for 8 weeks of the year- the only difference being in gear selection (including enchantments, gems, spec, etc.). You don't need to mindlessly farm in order to remain competitive.

Could an entire MMO work this way? I understand that grinding gives people a sense of achievement when they finally get the piece of gear they've been hunting, which keeps them playing; but does that piece of gear have to be functional? If WoW taught me anything, it's that people will spend ridiculous amounts of time farming for something that is entirely aesthetic (a mount, for example) or for a badge of honour (like an achievement); neither of which actually affect a character's abilities.

---------------------------------------------------------------

**Imagine an MMO without levels.**

Upon creation of a new character, players may be prompted to undergo 10 or so training levels to give them a feel for the class abilities and play style, but it would be optional.

The character would start with some ugly starter gear that marked them as a noob for all to see. To prove your worth to other players, you would undertake quests and dungeons that rewarded more aesthetically pleasing gear, depending on the difficulty of obtaining the item in question. The item would also state its origin in its stats upon inspection.

All areas of a massive world would be accessible by all players. How survivable they are is up to you.  

A brand new character could move directly into end game content and succeed if the player was skilled enough.

**World exploration and ""leveling"".**

Your gear and achievements would stand as testimony to the advanced dungeons your character has traversed. You could choose prospective party members based on their skills. ""Oh, well he hasn't completed dungeon X, but I can see he survived dungeon Y, which is pretty tough."" 

""Leveling"" would consist of completing tasks that allow you to join groups for harder tasks. Experienced players would only have to complete a few before beginning ""end game"" content.

**Raids**

You could enter any raid upon character creation, provided you had a party to go with. Leveling is an easy, tedious and boring task for anyone with end-game experience, and shouldn't be forced on anyone.

**Immersion** 

When an NPC tells you, at level 6, that you should not enter a cave because a powerful monster lives there, you pay attention. Then you go back at level 15 to one-hit that monster. At level cap the monster is a joke.

Imagine an MMO world where the NPCs give you realistic expectations of the monsters lurking around the world. Imagine hearing about a cave nobody survives, and knowing for a fact that only one or two guilds have seen the last boss. 

**Conclusion**

I realised I've been ranting for a while and have probably repeated myself, but I hope I got the idea across. Have I missed any of the motivations that keep people playing MMOs? Level cap isn't an achievement you can brag about; most WoW servers have more capped players than uncapped. If the prestige of high success still exists in the form of exclusive gear and mounts, then why do we need the grind?
