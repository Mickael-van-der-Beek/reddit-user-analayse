My alt (SonataNo8) was made a moderator of this subreddit a while back, but what I hadn't noticed was that the founder had left, leaving me as the sole mod. I hadn't been paying much attention outside of the modmail, and I'm seeing a lot of posts in the spam filter that should have been approved and never were. I'm very sorry about that, I'll be keeping a closer eye on the filter now. 

If you have any ideas or suggestions on how we can improve the subreddit, please post them here or contact me by pm or modmail anytime.

Just took a peek at C# today and I'm pretty blown. I mean, I've heard snippets of it (Quora once contemplated using C# as their backend) and seems better than its uncle, VB. 

So I'm curious about a few things here. When you want to read input, the syntax is `var name = System.Console.ReadLine();` ... Is there a better way to achieve this? The above code looks pretty Python-ish and it's kinda disturbing, especially since C# **is** a C dialect. Does C# have a `scanf` equivalent? And other cool tricks you'd like to share?

Also, I know there is the mono project, but how safe is it to use? Is it overly complicated, because I was thinking of typing some C# on a Linux distro and I don't want anything more complicated than a `gcc $file ..`

Anyways, thank you for your time here and I'd be interested to read the comments later.

I've just recently started to learn to code. I have dabbled a little in C++, but it was only a first-level course.

Why C#? I don't really know, I guess its from many of my friends that codes, they gave me the hints up on learning C#, since its rather simple and easy to use. Some said I should learn the from the roots up starting with C++ or C(if I want a tough experiance).
One even suggested Python, he works mainly with web-coding so I guess Python is used mostly for that?

Anyway, I decided to start learning C#. On my own, not taking any classes. At my work I have a ton of free time now on the summer so I can code at work if I want to. Although I can't install anything on my workcomputer, and I haven't had the money to invest in a laptop, yet.

I found this site: http://www.compileonline.com/compile_csharp_online.php which let you code online, but it is rather limited when using inputs. I was wondering if there is a similar site that lets you use almost as close as possible to a comand prompt window.

* If covariance utilizes inheritance hierarchy (correct me if I'm wrong) to work such as when assigning a more derived object to a less derived reference, on what basis does contravariance work when it's the opposite way?
* Couldn't I hypothetically do something in the contravariant interface method that wouldn't be allowed by the less derived type object which will be assigned? Why or why not?
* Why can a covariant type only be referenced as the return type? What is the limiting reason?
* Why can a contravariant type only be referenced as the type of the method argument and not as the return type? What is the limiting reason?
* In what situations or examples can covariance and contravariance become necessary or useful? Please keep the examples simple and/or use generic interfaces to explain since I have not reached delegates yet.

If you can answer any of these questions I'd be very grateful.

We like the mechanics of the game and the idea behind it, so we want to carry on developing this as a group project.

I have two questions. My first is about csproj files; is it possible to write separate csproj files that reference platform specific assemblies (api compatible but built for different platforms) and have those platform specific csproj files include another csproj file that references only code and content?

My second question is regarding documentation. I've seen how useful triple forward slash comments can be and I want to somehow integrate them with something like Sphinx (Which I have used at work with Python code). My current plan is to use Doxygen to parse the triple forward slash comments, use Breathe to allow Sphinx to work with the Doxygen generated api docs. Does anyone have any experience doing something like this and can you suggest any ways of improving or automating the process, especially if it can be integrated with something like Read The Docs.

    int asd = (int)e.ViewInfo.Appointment.CustomFields[""randomName""];

was causing my program to jump to a random place in the code(jumping into another function).  
It seemed to be not completely random: First time reaching the above line = jump to line x, second time -&gt; line y, third time -&gt; line y, fourth time -&gt; line z (then i stopped testing).

Well... I solved the problem this way:

    int asd = Convert.ToInt32(e.ViewInfo.Appointment.CustomFields[""randomName""]); 


But I would still like to know what may cause behaviour like this.  
My first attemt in fixing it was completely rebuilding the project, then I checked for events and seached for something that may happen when getting the e.ViewInfo.Appointment.CustomFields[""randomName""] variable...none of them fixed the problem, but what I wrote above did...I am slightly confused now.  

All Ideas are welcome, maybe I will test them =)

UPDATE:
After hours of testing, I can say that my initial thoughts are probably wrong.
The same thing now happens at another line, which has nothing in common with the previous one.

The line it jumps to is roughly in the area where something happens, that triggers the event that calls the function the lines are in.

There is stuff in the function that still needs to be executed, and it sadly breaks my complete program if this jump happens.

First off, let me thank this group for helping me out with a lot of my daily work. I come here often to read up on the latest and greatest in C# development. 

I recently started work on a Project which is written in C# and has both a Front end in ASP.NET and Web Services component in WCF. A small piece of this Integration needs to be re-written to be integrated with a Third party API.

Now here are the issues

1. The current state of code has very little to almost NO documentation
2. Configuration files are old, may or may not be using some or all of the key parameters
3. Parts of code may not be used at all and there is no ""Deprecated"" advice from the Developers. 
4. NO Documentation on the Architecture, Process flow and or Page flow within the Application
5. I do not have Debug permissions until at least 2 more weeks (Slow process within the Company for access related stuff)

With all these issues, I need some guidance to do the following

1. Creating a process/page flow diagrams with some analysis of the Code
2. Document pieces of code that will have to be re-written for the Integration
and Finally,
3. To understand the new Integration and how much of the code may / may not be re-used. 

Any direction in this regard will be of great help.

I guess UAC is going to be a fact of life in windows going forward, but it presents a problem for me in a little application Im writing. I need to be able to remotely stop some windows services. Here is the code I wrote that works fine when running as a domain admin:

But when I run as a non-domain admin, I get an access denied error. When I manually log on to that box as the non-admin user and open services, I get the UAC popup. If i click through it, I can stop the services fine. 

How can I assert UAC permissions remotely?

Anyone know the best practice use cases here? Assume a C# solution in VS which includes several projects (a ""super-project""). One or more of the projects are actually library-type controls in their own right, and currently under source control. 

I want to be able to pull in the latest changes made to the original library project (think custom controls), so that they are reflected in the super-project. 

Also, If I make a customization to one of the library projects within the project group, I would like the option to push changes back upstream if I decide the change should be universal to that particular control. Other changes I may want to keep only within the version being used in the super-project.

Is this a case for submodules, or for Subtree merging? If it not a clear case, what are the pitfalls? Each seems potentially messy. Does one model or the other lend itself better to Visual Studio's ""Solution"" structure?

I'm hoping someone can spoon feed me a little bit.  I'm doing a summer internship where I've been tasked at creating both an app and a web interface for something.  However all of my experience is in the linux realm using LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP).

Could someone please explain to me how exactly the following pieces fit in the puzzle:

ASP - my understanding is that this a web-centric language much like PHP is.  Yes, no?

C# - So C# is a language.  Am I correct in the understanding that it's an extension of C in the same vein as C++ is an extension of C?  If so, are people using C# to program server-side scripts (in other words is C# used to replace ASP or am I smoking crack here?).  I'm not sure if I should be aiming to use C# just for the app I'm to build or for the whole deal.

.NET - I skimmed wikipedia's page on .NET but would truly appreciate a uber-brief explanation of .NET and what this ""framework"" is for.

Now then, I am using 'Murach's ASP.Net 4.0 Web Programming with C# as a study reference, and Visual Studio 2010 for developing. Now then, I should first note that I haven't been in the programming groove for 5+ years and have since forgotten some of the basics, so forgive me if I call something by the wrong name and so forth. 

Now then, I am working on 'SessionsState' and am confused about the functionality and the usage. 

The examples provided by the book are: 

**A statement that adds or updates a session state item**  

EX: Session[""Cart""] = cart;

**Another way to add or update a session state item**  

EX: Session.Add(""Cart"", cart);

What I am confused about I guess is the entire thing. I don't get what's going on here at all, and I've read the chapter twice. They had me create a class identifying 3 variables:  

Public Class Customer  
    Public Property FirstName As String  
    Public Property LastName As String  
    Public Property Email As String  
End Class  

Which is called Customer.vb  

They then want me to:

&gt;""4. Switch back to the CheckOut page and add an event handler for the Load event of the page. 

I've got that down.

&gt;If the page is not being posted back, this event handler should get a Customer object from session state and store it in a variable that's declared outside the method.  

So I came up with:

If (!IsPostBack); 

but that's as far as I can get, I just don't understand. The rest of the step follows:  

&gt; Then, if session state doesn't contain a customer object, this variable will store a null value. If it doesn't store a null value, though, this method should display the customer information in the text boxes.

That being said, I'm looking for a few pointers, or perhaps some pseudocode that's a little easier to understand. 

I'm trying create the following program:

""Three salespeople work at Sunshine Hot Tubs— Andrea, Brittany, and Eric. Write a C# console application to prepare a Sales Commission report that prompts the user for a salesperson’s initial (‘ A’, ‘ B’, or ‘ E’). While the user does not type ‘ Z’, continue by prompting for the amount of three sales the salesperson made. Calculate the salesperson’s commission as 20 percent of the sales amount, and add the commission to a running total for that salesperson. After the user types ‘ Z’ for an initial, display each salesperson’s total commission earned, along with the total commission paid. Display a title and header for the report. Use a for loop to write the salesperson’s name, total sales and commission on one line of the report. Your application is expected to contain several methods.""

So I'm fairly sure that I've got it set up correctly where the user enters their name, but I'm having real hell with figuring out how to get and calculate the commission.

I have a web service which accepts data from our affiliates. I thought this business logic was in place, its not and it's causing problems with a few Affiliates that can't get their act together. 

We have separate columns in our database for Years and Months. And months should ONLY be 0-11 months. We shouldn't allow any value greater than 11. Since if it was 1 Year, 12 Months. That should be entered as 2 Years, 0 Months. 

So looking at the code I notice we just move the data.
 this.EmployerMonths = dt.Rows[0][""EmployedMonths""].ToString().PadLeft(1, '0');

So I thought I'd add the following to convert back to 11 if the value is greater. But then realized it was a string and not an int. So added the convert.toint32.
            // Make max employer months to be 11 months - Max 12-10-12

In 2007 I sat down one day and decided to pick up C# without any former training.  To learn as I go I started working on a fairly ambitious project (at least to me) -- an IRC Chat Bot.  

It started off as just a pre-made AIML bot, where it would load a dll that someone else had made for C# and spit out lines based on what people said in the rooms.  That grew tiresome so I decided to try to make a markov chain ""brain"" to the bot, which I based on an old friend's ruby bot called Language Bot (and you'll see I named the markov chain ""brain"" the ""LB Brain"" due to that).  

And it's been worked on off and on since. I've got a little bit of spare time this week and loaded it up after not touching it for a while. And..well, it's probably a huge wreck.  At this point the whole ""learn as I go"" thing is making the bot a huge mess.  And I'm not really sure where to go to really learn about how to fix this and improve it.  And I mean the code itself, not trying to improve how the lines are generated or any way to make the bot ""smarter"".

I threw the whole thing up on [google code](http://code.google.com/p/kon-csharp-chatterbot/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2FBin) and while I don't really expect anyone to seriously sit down and rewrite the bot for me, I'm really hoping someone here might be able to at least look through and give me some pointers/suggestions/maybe some code blocks to make things better. 
I tried to comment quite a bit as I went (as I was taking months off at a time and needed to know what I was doing when I came back) so hopefully you'll be able to follow what it's trying to do lol.

Also, if anyone knows of any solid, easy to tap into, pre-made IRC libraries to use..I'd appreciate that as well.  I'm really more interested in the markov chain/chat bot aspect.  Having to write my own IRC client in addition has been quite a headache for me.

Right now, I use methods that individually get/set the value of each control whenever the user loads or saves a new object (using event handlers linked to buttons on the form).  The code looks somewhat like this:

My background in programming beforehand was only VB.NET, but I picked up C# no problem. 

I am very much stuck on SQL, I've got the syntax. My task today is to learn how to use stored procedures, it seems easy enough, and maybe I'm making this a bigger problem than it should be, but I cannot for the life of my understand the how/why of stored procedures. I get that they're run on the server side, to save resources locally, and they're essentially precompiled SQL code that you call whenever you want to perform that function ( I like to think that they're similar to a 'class' in the C# world)....but I just can't wrap my head around it. So what I am asking of you, sweet reddit, is for a super basic guide that works with Visual Studio and SQL and C# and goes step by step....creating a database, adding tables, and then manipulating the data with stored procedures....my googling has given me a few resources, but I get overwhelmed as soon as something's mentioned that I don't understand (which is a good amount) and as a result, I go into a hosing state in which I can't do anything.

So here it is, I have a class called UI that is pretty much the HUD for the game I'm working on. The UI class is responsible for updating a list of buttons once something is selected (i.e. you select a building it displays the buttons that are associated with that building). The way I would like to do this is have a object that holds a reference to what is currently selected, once it changes it updates the buttons. The thing is I don't have a base class for everything that can be selected so I can't just polymorph from a generic class to the more specific type. I have two main base classes, building and unit. Now the obvious solution would be to create two objects to hold a reference, one for buildings and another for units but that is bad design and isn't very modular (plus if I had another base class for a different type of unit I would have to do a lot more coding to get that to work). The next solution I thought of would be using generics but I still have the same problem with polymorphing but with the bonus of type safety. Then again I could always choose Object as the base class and go from there although that doesn't seem like very good practice either.

I'm working on a 3D viewer using OpenTK. The 3D viewing part works fine. I can already import STL files (Which is a format designed for 3D printers and it outputs an array of triangles. Pretty simple but also limited), and interact with them with no problem.


Now I'm trying to write a parser for a 3D format called XGL. XGL follows the XML standard.
In this format you have an interesting structure of objects, which can have meshes and other objects within themselves.
[This is all the documentation I could find about the file format](http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/xgl/xgl_spec.html).


It is the first time that I try to parse an XML file and I don't want to reinvent the wheel. I understand that because the structure of the objects in the XGL file are flexible (there may or may not be children, those children may or may not have more children) I have to make a class that can accommodate all this (I can't just have the class be generated from the info on the XML file, is this right?). But I don't know how to handle the hierarchy, how to know when I left a node and I'm back at a different property of it's parent.

I would really appreciate it if somebody could point me in the right direction. Maybe I'm making this too complicated and there is a semi-automatic way to generate a class and fill it with information. What would be the easiest way of doing something like this?
Any interesting reads or similar projects?

I've finalized the Ideas and am in the process of making them work, but I have a simple problem that requires complex code that I am confused about.

The problem that I have is that I want to create a method, lets say called ""AddCommand"", with the following parameters, ""(string command, [method] script)"". when the user wants to add a command to the program, instead of requiring them to make a complex switch statement with lines beyond lines of code for it to execute,  I want them to have a simple command, ""AddCommand(""/walk"", script.WalkScript());"" to add the command. In the example I provided I want the program to realize, when the user types ""/walk"", it will invoke ""script.WalkScript();"" (I have an empty Script class, script is a Script object, with a method RunScript). But that is my problem. For one, I have made the method store ""/walk"" in an array, but I do not know how to store the ""script.WalkScript()"" method. I know I could make a Delegate, but that would require the USER to make a delegate for each method, which is a complex idea I dont want to require them to do. So firstly, how would I be able to do this, in a way that the ONLY thing the user would be require to do is make a simple ""WalkScript"" method in the Script class, then do the command ""Add Command"" method.

1372191584.0,3,self.csharp,1h26mh,Wait on async tasks from synchronous methods without deadlocking in WindowsForms/ASP.NET,BecauseItOwns,6,3,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/1h26mh/wait_on_async_tasks_from_synchronous_methods/,"Hi Folks, I released a (very small) library to call asynchronous tasks from synchronous methods and get their results. It's been a huge help so far so I thought I'd share it to help others and get feedback on improvements to make.

Link: [AsyncBridge](https://github.com/tejacques/AsyncBridge)

Background:
While working on an older ASP.NET project, I began writing async functions to take advantage of concurrency in DB calls, however, since most of the project predated async, it was not ""Turtles all the way down"" and I encountered extremely frustrating deadlocks while trying to queue up multiple tasks and wait on them. In my searching I came across several articles including [this one](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/jj991977.aspx) which mentioned you could ""[only] mix blocking and async code [in] Console main method"". I began trying to find ways around this, but most either didn't work or were extremely cumbersome and inelegant.

Finally after a lot of searching I came across [this class](http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/163ef755-ff7b-4ea5-b226-bbe8ef5f4796/is-there-a-pattern-for-calling-an-async-method-synchronously) by John Melville which nearly did what I wanted. His class is the foundation for mine, and allows you to unwrap the result of a task that's run synchronously by passing it as a lamba.

E.G.

    public async Task&lt;string&gt; AsyncString()
    {
        await Task.Delay(1000);
        return ""TestAsync"";
    }

    public void Test()
    {
        string s = AsyncInline.RunSync(() =&gt; AsyncString());
    }

That was pretty good, but it wasn't very easy to queue up multiple tasks in a way to use that effectively, and you also had to wrap all of the tasks in lambdas, which is extra boilerplate.

What I came up with was a compromise between extracting the result easily, and queuing up multiple async tasks easily, and the result looks like this:

    public async Task&lt;string&gt; AsyncString()
    {
        await Task.Delay(1000);
        return ""TestAsync"";
    }
    
    public void Test()
    {
        string string1 = """";
        string string2 = """";
    
        using (var A = AsyncHelper.Wait)
        {
            A.Run(AsyncString(), x =&gt; string1 = x.Result);
            A.Run(AsyncString(), x =&gt; string2 = x.Result);
        }
    
        // Total Execution time at this point will be ~1000ms, not ~2000ms
        // The value of string1 = ""TestAsync""
        // The value of string2 = ""TestAsync""
    }

Exceptions bubble up to the top and stop execution of all queued tasks. Here's an example:

    public async Task&lt;string&gt; AsyncStringException()
    {
        await Task.Delay(1000);
        throw new Exception(""Test Exception."");
    }

    public void TestException()
    {
        string s = """";
    
        try
        {
            using (var A = AsyncHelper.Wait)
            {
                A.Run(AsyncString(), x =&gt; s = x.Result);
            }
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            // e.Message                 = ""AsyncBridge.Run method threw an exception.""
            // e.InnerException.Message) = ""Test Exception.""
            // Handle exception
            // ...
        }
    }

The library also allows for easy error handling with the Fire And Forget pattern, which can be called from either a synchronous function or an asynchronous one.

    public void Test()
    {
        AsyncHelper.FireAndForget(
            () =&gt; { /* Do Stuff on the thread pool */ },
            exception =&gt; { /* Optional exception handling, silently drop by default */ });
    }

This avoids the problem that can occur with memory leaks by calling Task.Run without handling exceptions, because the tasks sit around in memory holding onto the exception data until it is handled.

For readers who don't use TPL: *CancellationTokens are similar to booleans; convenient in loop conditionals for ""should I continue working on this?""*

Unfortunately, CancellationTokens aren't passed into Task Actions as objects despite being explicitly used as Task parameters; Because the Task's Token is only for stopping Tasks before they start. Is there an easy way to pass a token into every Task's Action without doing Action&lt;token&gt;?

**Background:** I'm learning C# by trial and error. The theme is that there's a long multi-threaded calculation being tossed off of the UI thread, and callbacks are used where you might expect returns. However, the UI may change the query before the calculation completes, which means any CPU wasted on the old query will only slow down the current query. That's where the cancellation comes in.

I need some second or third eyes to look over this, since right now, the necessary actions to make this work sound just bad and I suppose I am missing something due to a lack of C# experience. 

I am currently working on a winforms c# application. More specifically, I am reworking a highly convoluted control flow between a custom winforms widget and the corresponding controller. 

To nail down some terms, the widget is called a DrawingPanel. On the drawing panel, the user can place certain components, which can be considered orange squares for now. He can select single components by clicking on them with the left button, he can select multiple components by dragging a box around them. Once he has components selected, he can right click and select operations like cut, paste, copy and so on with the obvious semantics. For usability reasons, he can also use these operations on a single component without selecting it. 

In the old state, the control flow between the DrawingPanel and the so-called EventManager mostly looks like two angry cats wrestling in mud, as it goes back and forth about 4 - 6 times in order to deduce the set of selected components. Somewhere in there, they are highlighted, but after an hour, I gave up deducing that for now, especially because there are about 2 dead highlighting functions in there. Since I have to add quite a bit of funcionality here, I guess it is up to me to redo this. 

In order to redo this, I figured a good way to straighten this out would be the following:

I add one event per user command to the DrawingPanel. The Controller of the DrawingPanel subscribes to these events and modifies the model accordingly in the event handler. For example, if a set of components is selected and the user clicks on ""Copy"" in the context menu, a CopyRequest-Event is raised which has this set of arguments as an argument. If a user clicks on ""Paste"" in the component menu, a PasteRequest-Event is raised, which is parametrized by the position of the paste request.

This should encapsulate the user interface, as the interface is reduced to a black box which is parametrized by the data model and raises events from the user. The EventManager could handle all user interfaces, which provide the appropiate events. Furthermore, the control flow would be greatly simplified, as it would become unidirectional: UI goes to Controller goes to Model.

Now, onto my problem. I have some very heavy code duplication in my event handlers in the DrawingPanel. A ton of event handlers subscribe to the Click-Event of a context menu, wrap the currently selected components into an ComponentSetArgument-object and fire the request-event with this new argument (if its not null). I am failing to remove this duplication. 

So far, I have tried to implement a higher order event handler generator (which would take a component set event and generate an evenhandler to subscribe at the click-event) and a mapping function on events (which would handle the click-event, apply a function and signal the outgoing event). Both of these fail because the multiway delegates are immutable. Thus, correct functionality would depend on creating the mapping or calling the wrap+call-higher order function after all subscribers are subscribed to the event. This yells ""recipe for disaster"" for me.

So, is there anything I can do beyond either tolerating this massive duplication or rolling my own subscription management there? Or, do I take the totally wrong way there and there is a massively better architecture here?",,False,self,t5_2qhdf,False,,,True,t3_p38lk,http://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/p38lk/where_is_my_architecture_broken/,

http://www.csharp-station.com/Tutorial/CSharp/Lesson09

    using System;

            DrawingObject[] dObj = new DrawingObject[4];

            }

            return 0;
        }
    }

Under this code, he says this:

&gt;The type of object in this array is the DrawingObject class. The array is named dObj and is being **initialized** to hold four objects of type DrawingObject.
&gt;
&gt;Next the dObj array is **initialized**.

Normally I would write it off as an error in the description, but this particular method of creating instances has always confused me for just this reason. It seems that you need to initialize them twice, once to create the instance, and another to....create...the instance? I don't know. Help, please.

I work in an office that does a lot of shipping/receiving. We use a system I've designed that prints labels/receipts/checks on all sorts of printers. A lot of time is wasted clicking a link, opening the file (pdf), selecting print, and choosing the printer.

Traditionally you can't print directly from a browser to an application, so I thought maybe I could use some sort of custom URL handler, and do something like this...

As I understand it a critical section is code that can be accessed by only one thread, the danger being one thread will overwrite a value before the other is finished and vice versa. What can you do about changes made outside of your class for example, I have a line monitoring program:

    int currentNumber = provider.GetCurrentNumber();
    if(provider.CanPassNumber(false, currentNumber))
    {
    currentNumber+=2;
    provider.SetNumber(currentNumber);
    }

and on another thread I have something like this:

    if(condition)
        provider.SetNumber(numberToSet);


Now I'm afraid that in the first function I get currentNumber which is 5, right after that on another thread the number is set to 7 and then it rewrites the 7 to 6, ignoring the change made by the thread that set it to 7.

Is there anyway to lock provider.SetNumber until the first function finishes? The critical section is basically the currentNumber which can be changed by many places in the program.

I hope I made myself clear, if not let me know and I will try to explain myself better.

EDIT: Also I made the functions really short for the example. In reality the function is much longer and makes changes to currentNumber many times so I don't really want to put a lock around the entire function. If I lock every call to provider.SetNumber and release it after I finish it can change during the time it is released before I lock it again to call provider.SetNumber. Honestly I'm also worried about locking the entire function because of performance and deadlock.",,False,self,t5_2qhdf,False,,,True,t3_f9zgf,http://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/f9zgf/need_some_help_with_locking_a_shared_resource/,

1374425929.0,2,self.csharp,1ir9mv,"My experience with WPF, and why you shouldn't be afraid of Expression Blend.",SayNoToWar,3,1,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/1ir9mv/my_experience_with_wpf_and_why_you_shouldnt_be/,"Recently I've been writing a mailing app for a friend. Actually a hot chick I was dating. Needless to say since I didn't want to disappoint and wanted the quickest result I started off with tried and trusted Winforms. 

Why? Because I know Winforms. I know what to expect, I know the controls and although I knew the interface would come out looking a bit 1990's I felt the functionality was more important. Mainly I wanted to deliver :) But WPF and more importantly Expression Blend scared the hell out of me. I had this idea, it will be like Flash, and the last time I tried that it didn't go down very well. 

So I did the whole app in Windows forms. With more than enough time to spare, I decided I would create a v2 only this time using WPF for the front end. 

So 3 nights of coffee and no sleep, some tutorials and a bit of fiddling and experimenting, these are my findings. 

1. WPF with Visual Studio 2012 has come a long way and XAML has matured. However the whole WPF drag and drop type of styling isn't entirely there yet. Like every single other WYSIWYG editor, Blend too has it's problems, and you will be expected from time to time to edit XAML, but this isn't too big a deal. 

Examples: When adding a groupbox control -&gt; by default it only supports 1 child, so you manually need to add a GRID element. 

Some properties such as font colors don't update. Manually editing the XAML - fixes everything. 

2. Ok the Blend interface has some quirks - but all in all you can get everything done. 

3. What is Expression Blend? It's basically a designer tool like Macromedia Flash. However the lines blur between code and design because you can also code inside of Blend (but it's a bit limited). So it is best to have a solution open in both VS (for coding and debugging) and Blend for designing. For example you can't drag an image onto the canvas using Visual Studio, likewise you don't get great code completion using Blend. 

4. What is WPF anyways, isn't Silverlight dead? WPF is far from dead, and is actually a really awesome way to create great looking UI's. I think Microsofts main reason for killing off Silverlight is because they have intentions of IE natively supporting WPF. 

IE sucks so what's the point? HTML5 rules, WPF is dead! Again not so. Yes IE sucks, and no I don't have any plans to start using it soon. I'm not even going to try entice you with the whole ""corporate thin client"" usage. Instead I'm going to be hopeful and dream of the day when rendering engines (and 3rd party ones) can be installed in ALL of the popular browsers. An open source XAML rendering engine funded by Microsoft might just kick start this whole thing. 

Don't hole your breath? WPF is still good for Winform applications and there is always the Mono implementation for Linux apps. 

5. Without any formal training was I able to create a stunning user interface? Yes absolutely. My application isn't finished, but in 3 days I've learnt more than just the basics of WPF. I haven't even touched on overwriting control styles yet, and even without that, I've managed to create an app that looks a whole lot better than the Winforms app. 

6. What about animations and storyboards? Now here is where many desktop developers start getting the shivers from fear. Just remember the whole animation delivery is event driven. 

For example. I had 5 buttons I wanted to fade in and slide into view from the top of my form on FormLoad. Using Blend you assign the onLoad event to a storyboard. In the storyboard you have a time line, at each point in the timeline controls can have differant properties. Since it is key frame driven, XAML rendering figures out the interpolation between frames. So if you have opacity set to 0% at start, and 5 seconds later you have it set to 100%, the rendering takes care of the animation inbetween. Same for positioning, same for any property. 

7. Would you recommend it. Yes whole heartily. If you're a desktop WinForms developer. Take the plunge, set aside some time on a weekend, and just do it.

Half of the topics needed for our assignments haven't been covered in lecture or in the assigned text. Working with wave files is something the professor feels we can research solely through Google. I've spent a good amount of time researching it and I've found some bread crumbs, but I was wondering if this forum could give any advice? 

Thanks

I no longer have access to Visual Studio to debug it. Can anyone help me out and run it through a debugger to see where in the source it's causing the ""overflow exception""?

My first attempt was to write an extension for a webbrowser forms control, which was going great until I reached a page that had the entire HTMl generated dynamically through jquery.  I couldn't access any of the generated controls. 

As I understand it, I can get around this by using the mshtml library and reading the IHTMLDocument2, but then I totally lose the functionality of the web browser control which made it so useful.  It's pretty much just a raw HTML document without the usefulness of invoking javascript or set values/attributes etc.

My question is more high level, did I run into a solvable issue with my first strategy and I didn't realize it.

Hopefully I'm missing something very simple here.  I've got a C# (4.5) WPF application that currently has cosmetic changes for each customer that uses the app.  These changes basically consist of a couple of images (company logo, etc) and some strings (Company names, procedural names, etc) rather than any changes to the business logic.

What I was hoping existed, was something very similar to the Localisation satellite assembly functionality, whereby I could have a separate class library project for each customer containing just a resource file, which would contain the changes to wording and images for that specific customer.  (e.g.  CustomerResources.dll).   If the CustomerResources library existed existed in the deployed package, then this would be searched for resources and if the specified resource wasn't found it would fall back to the main application (Neutral) Resources.

This would mean that only the strings and images that a customer wanted Customised would need to be their resource file, and their specific CustomerResources be included in their release package. 

I started putting something together using a MarkUp Extension for the Resource Strings, but hit some difficulties when it came to images declared within the XAML.

I briefly thought about using the Localisation framework to do this (e.g. provide a ""en-GB"" or ""en-US"" resource which is customer based, falling back to a neutral ""en"" resource library) but quickly realised this would be very problematic since I'd be relying on the correct Culture being set on their PC, and additionally would just lead to all sorts of headaches when the application does need to be properly localised.

I was wondering if there was any more straightfoward way of doing this that someone could suggest?  Failing that, I'll carry on using extensions and helper classes to roll my own.  I just thought this may be a fairly common problem.

I'm new to OOP and to C#.  Can someone do a bit of explainlikeimfive for me?  I'm learning by rewriting a program that uses an XML file as a data source to use a SQL Server database as its data source.  The only problem is that my work environment is a medical one and so there are announcements going off all the time and I'm called away so often that I can't coherently string two thoughts together.  I have to write everything down so I can come back to it.  This is the bit of code I'm looking at.  I think I can grok more of it than I can explain because I don't have the vocabulary.

private static void LoadProducts(string path)

{

    products c;

    var s = new XmlSerializer(typeof (products));

    var fs = new FileStream(path, FileMode.Open);

    TextReader reader = new StreamReader(fs);

    try

    {

	     fs.Position = 0;

	     c = (products) s.Deserialize(reader);

	     fs.Close();


         _toys = c.toys != null ? c.toys.ToList() : new List&lt;ProductsToy&gt;();

...............................................................................................

The first line is the declaration of a method to which is passed the xml file path in string form.

""products c"" comes from ""public partial class products"" (a class created by Visual Studio when adding the ""products.xml"" file as a data source?).  

Would the above be declaring a variable of user-defined type?

The line that really gets me is this one:

_toys = c.toys != null ? c.toys.ToList() : new List&lt;ProductsToy&gt;();

I think that this means ""Set _toys equal to the toys instance data of object c where c.toys isn't null, make _toys a list equal to the list of Toy elements in the xml document Products.""

------

Hey all, I inherited some code that I'm attempting to put into my C# project. It's used to check whether a particular user is a member of a particular AD group. GetGroups is a seperate class file which returns group information based on the AD User name. The SessionSessGroups variable is a string value containing all groups found for that AD Username. 

I've been looking over it for a couple of days and am drawing a blank as to how to make this work, I'm still pretty new to this so any help in the right direction would be greatly appreciated. 

The confusion on my end is the line where isallowed is assigned the value. I understand what it's trying to do(find whether the groupname is in the SessionSessGroups string or not), but not sure what the C# equivalent is to this?  Is this an overloaded method? I can post elsewhere if this is not the relevant subreddit.
        
    Session(""sessview"") = """"


        Dim isallowed As Int16

So I tried doing a home made TryParse, essentially a try-catch with the normal parse. That had the same effect; the resulting double was always 0. Here's the parsing method:

		public static bool GetDouble(string stringToConvert, out double convertedString) //Convert a string to a double
		{
			if (double.TryParse(stringToConvert, out convertedString) &amp;&amp; convertedString &gt;= 0)

Notice the MessageBox. That's just a temporary thing I did to see the two values. The first one is always the one I type in, but the second one is always 0.

Here's the calling method:

I've been searching all the provided documents but I still can't figure it out.

This is the errenous part of my Main class:

		private bool ReadAndValidateInput(out string name, out double price)
		{
			if (ReadAndValidateName(string name) &amp;&amp; ReadAndValidatePrice(double price))
				return true;
			else
				return false;

		private ReadAndValidatePrice(double price)
		{	
			if (InputUtility.GetDouble(string name, out double price));	//Makes sure the number is positive.
				return true;
			else
				return false;
		}

It's filled to the brim with errors, I know. I tried to change a ton of things to make it work but I probably just made it worse. I simply don't know how to do this assignment because I've never seen a complete use of it. From what the compiler catches at the moment:

; expected after ReadAndValidateName, &amp;&amp; and after ReadAndValidatePrice. Plus a } expected right after the first if Also 'Method must have a return type' at ReadAndValidatePrice, all on the same line. Then 'Expected class, delegate, enum, interface or struct' on both of the lines that have methods. Finally, I have a 'Type or namespace definition, or end-of-file expected' at the bottom, but if I remove a } I get an '} expected' in the same place.

This is the used part of the utility class, the compiler doesn't say anything about errors or warnings in that class.

		public static bool GetInteger(string stringToConvert, out int intOutValue) //Convert a string to an int
		{
			if (int.TryParse(stringToConvert, out intOutValue) &amp;&amp; intOutValue &gt;= 0)
				return true;
			else
				return false;
		}
		
		public static bool GetDouble(string stringToConvert, out double doubleOutValue) //Convert a string to a double
		{
			if (double.TryParse(stringToConvert, out doubleOutValue) &amp;&amp; doubleOutValue &gt;= 0)

			else
				return false;

		public static bool ValidateString(string stringToCheck) //Eliminates white space in a string and makes sure it's not empty.
		{
			string strIn = stringToCheck.Trim();
			if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(stringToCheck))
				return false;
			else
				return true;
		}

I would be most grateful if someone could point out how it's supposed to look. I know this sounds like 'hey, do my homework!' but I'm completely dumbfounded. If you still don't believe me, then at least give me another example similar to mine. I want to at least see how it's supposed to look.

I'm wondering how to go about programming an SMS payment system, I'm currently working on a project where I'd like users to be able to pay for virtual currency using their phone for small transactions. 

How I'm imagining it to work:

 * User texts a number with EXAMPLE 100
 * User receives a confirmation text explaining the charge
 * User replies with either ACCEPT or DECLINE
 * If user replies with ACCEPT, text them a randomly generated code that will be used to redeem the virtual currency on my website.

I know that what I'm trying to achieve is possible, [here's an example](http://gateway.txtnation.com/solutions/sms/premium/payforit/). There are some third party services available that can do this for me, but I'm interested to see how I could implement it myself - even if only as a programming exercise.

Thanks!

So, whenever an invoice comes in I just check that criteria to see if a rep matches it and, if so, apply commission. This has worked for the first 1.5 years since the app went live. However, as our company has grown, some rep contracts no longer are specified as an exact location, but rather criteria such as ""all facilities in Miami, FL"". So, right now whenever we add a new location I have to manually go back in and add commission for that location (if we even remember to do that). 

I know that has to be a better way. But, I'm just not sure how to implement it. My first thought was to have another table that has City and State as columns and then add a trigger on the Locations table, then whenever a Location is inserted it would check that table to see if it matches, and, if so, it would automatically create the Commission record.

Does anyone else have any other recommendations?

",Midasx,2,2,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/14zwr8/messagebox_magically_makes_a_function_work_im/,"So I am taking an array of file paths that are mp3's and passing them to my play function. The play function will play them in sequence by first selecting the song then calculating how long it is then sleeping that long. At which point the loop goes through the next iteration and plays the next track. 

However the way I have it now, the loop just skips to the end track. During my debugging I had a MessageBox popup some information and low and behold this makes it work perfectly. The problem is now I have a MessageBox. 

I figured that the MessageBox was giving the function enough time to calculate the song length and set the delay appropriately, so I tried adding a delay in with Thread.Sleep; however this meant that it just jumped to the last song again with a delay each time!

Here is the code:

        public void play(string[] file)
        {
            foreach (var song in file)
            {
                mediaPlayer.URL = song;
                MessageBox.Show(""Magic"");
                string length = ""00:"" + mediaPlayer.currentMedia.durationString;
                double delay = TimeSpan.Parse(length).TotalSeconds;
                delay = delay * 1000;
                int milisecs = Convert.ToInt32(delay);
                Thread.Sleep(milisecs);
            }

Some of you may remember my previous post, and I have done plenty of reading since then. I have, somewhat, solved my issue, and now I have something that works. It, however, doesn't seem terribly pretty.

One of my issues was ""A search can return multiple items. In that case, show a 'Duplicate items found, please choose one' dialog"". This I solved with a MultipleItems window, a MultipleItemsVM class, and sending a message called MultipleItemsFound(list_of_items, callback), and I send the message ""MultipleItemsFound(list_of_items, (i) =&gt; Sale.add(i)"". There's a little bit of CodeBehind to make the window appear and hide according to the contents of the DatraGrid. This seems acceptable, but maybe I'm missing something.

This works.

I thought, though, of making a Search Control (in order to encapsulate behavior that will be shared among 3 views/viewmodels), which would consist of a Textbox, and a Popup with a Textbox and a DataGrid. This element has the following behavior: 

* When an user presses Enter, it searches for any items with the code typed into the first TextBox.
      * If no items match, nothing happens.
      * If one item matches, the control's Item binding is changed.
      * If more than one item matches, the popup shows.
* When the user presses F2, all items are searched for, and the popup shows.

* The popup has 2 elements
     * When text is entered into its textbox, the DataGrid is filtered to match.
     * If the user double-clicks on an element, the control's Item binding is set.
     * If the user hits Escape, the popup is closed.

Then, I can just DataBind the Searcher's Item and when it changes, add it to my Sale (actually, it would trigger one of two events: AddItem, and RemoveItem, and it would also have a Count property, since one can type ""2*f00b4r"" to add 2 of some item type).

Should this be a simple, ""stupid"" control? Could/should I make a SearchViewModel and put all behavior there, and have all viewmodels contain (and publish) one of those? Is that making the VM ""too specific""? (Is the VM supposed to work unchanged with WPF and SL, for example? Or am I just making a mess of myself and one is simply supposed to create VMs when changing the view ""drastically""?)

Is this possible/correct/totally stupid? Should I stay with the first solution?

I know I'm overthinking this; I overengineer solutions in personal projects so they become simple when I need to do stuff quickly.

If you want to reference line 3 in your comment you would say ""@3"" that will get turned into a link that when clicked will flash line 3 red. If you want to reference a block of code you can type ""@3-5"" that will reference lines 3, 4, and 5. 
* The home page has been reworked to show all reviews (using infinite scroll) you can also optionally filter the reviews by language.
* SSL is used over the whole site to improve security.
* Red comment tabs appear on both sides of a review now so they should be more noticeable. 

Let me know what you think of this latest release.

I need a web application for a project I'm working on,. So I asked our IT department, and they developed it; it's now almost finished but some things are not working yet. I don't have access to the source code, but I asked for a snippet and found something scaring there, along these lines:

&gt;/\*   number of answer choices \*/
&gt;
&gt;       Rug.Ws.GameAnswerService.GameAnswerDto[] Nanswerdto =

&gt;                            new &gt;Rug.Ws.GameAnswerService.GameAnswerService().LoadAnswerByQuestion((long)questionId);

&gt;        NAnswers = (int) Nanswerdto.Length; 

The web application is some kind of quiz, this code should count how many answer we already got, reading them from the DB. The problem (I think) is that this code loads all this objects into memory just for counting them, which seems crazy to me. Also, the same structure is repeated many times in the code.

So I'm asking:

* is this the right way to count records in a DB in C# ?
* (if no) what is the right way?

I wrote a program that loops through a select amount of pictures, and also shows real-time public transit times. The public transit page is toggable, it can be turned on/off by sending a command to a server that's part of the program. The program is running on a kiosk, so the idea is to remotely control everything.

It worked for about 6 months, but now suddenly the program isn't responding to commands received on the server *unless* I ""get the attention"" by for example connecting with Teamviewer or shaking the mouse. After O do this the command is processed and the page is turned on/off, And continues to do so for a while until it ""falls asleep"" again.

Does anyone recognize the problem, or have suggestions on how to fix it?

It's a C# WPF application. The server is running on a separate thread (there's separate threads for the clock and public transit data retriever as well).

I would say I am roughly intermediate level with C#. I have 2 years of college experience with it on top of 6 months of business experience with Fraternal Life Insurance software (creating a friendly interface, SQL with database, creating custom events, creating controls that enforce data integrity, etc). I understand basics, delegates, events, interfacing with a database, 3-layer design, etc. I feel like I need a better idea of ASP.NET or WPF/XAML. 

So, does anyone have any suggestions on what would be useful skills to learn that I can apply for experience, or perhaps I could help out somewhere if there is something someone needs help with that is C# related so that I can put my skills to use and learn? Would greatly GREATLY appreciate any good ideas or suggestions. I have been considering App market (Possibly buying Mono or brushing up on my Java for Android dev)... stuff like that.
