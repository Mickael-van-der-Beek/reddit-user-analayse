1375324841.0,263,self.languagelearning,1jgu68,I've learned two languages this way. Forget TV shows and movies. All you need is your browser. Let's go.,talkr,299,36,110,http://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/1jgu68/ive_learned_two_languages_this_way_forget_tv/,"Basically learning a language is all about getting immersed, and the TV Shows and movies just don't get it done.  Immersion is about Listening, Speaking, Reading, and Writing.  This exercise emphasizes all but Writing, which is the least important (I think).

TV Shows and Movies don't have enough dialogue.  They aren't supposed to.  Watching News is much better. The dialogue is crisper and in the standard accent most of the time.  They seem to speak fast at first, but stick with it. Your listening comprehension will go through the roof after just a little while. The key is that they are constantly talking.  Here is the 24-hour streaming French news station, [BFMTV](http://www.bfmtv.com/video/bfmtv/direct/). 

Now here's the fun part.

As they are talking and giving the news, start reading the ticker at the bottom out loud.  It challenges you to read quickly before it changes. Don't worry, it's usually just a sentence or two.  This is the best Reading/Speaking drill I have ever come across in my 8 years of language learning.  Turn up the volume just a little bit louder than normal and talk over the [French] newscaster (important).  Now you're immersed.

I've read half a dozen French novels out loud to further my Speaking skillset.  The thing is this:  You cannot passively learn a language, so watching TV shows or movies simply just won't cut it in my opinion.

1358457121.0,184,self.languagelearning,16rvgs,A study comparing the effectiveness of Duolingo to Rosetta Stone and college classes.,vonahn,204,20,74,http://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/16rvgs/a_study_comparing_the_effectiveness_of_duolingo/,"There are a lot of anecdotal and marketing claims about the effectiveness of different language learning methods, but there is usually little scientific evidence to back the claims. We wanted to change that, so we commissioned a study to find out how well people learn a language on Duolingo.

Here’s a [link to the final report](http://static.duolingo.com/s3/DuolingoReport_Final.pdf).

Some interesting points:

1. On average, it takes 34 hours of Duolingo to learn the equivalent of one semester of college. Since a semester of college generally takes a lot more than 34 hours of work, this suggests that Duolingo is more effective than a college course.

2. The study was done by an external research team that previously evaluated the effectiveness of other methods such as Rosetta Stone. It is of note that it took 55 hours of study with Rosetta Stone to reach the equivalent of one semester of college. So not only is Duolingo free-er than Rosetta Stone, the study suggests it’s also better.

We plan on using this data and continually conducting studies to make learning a language with Duolingo even better.

Assimil - A graded series of bilingual dialogues with target language audio. Eschews translation and grammar explanation. Many languages are available, but many are only available for French speakers.

FSI - Drill-based courses with text and audio issued by the US government. Many are avaiable for free download.

Michel Thomas - Audio-based course which attempts to teach grammar through explanation.

Pimsleur - Audio-based course which teaches phrases and repeats at specific intervals to aid memorization.

Rosetta Stone - Uses pictures, audio and text to try to teach vocabulary and grammar without explanation. Its effectiveness is controversial and mention of it often leads to argument. Rather expensive.

Teach Yourself - Presents dialogues with audio and translation. Includes vocabulary lists, grammar explanation and translation exercises. Quality varies from course to course and edition to edition.

I hope this helps some of you out.,,149,21,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/lv6fp/a_weird_personal_tip_for_getting_a_great_accent_i/,"I'm an american, so when speaking other languages, I can put an american spin on another language that makes natives cringe. I came across Stuttering John's website. (He used to be on the Howard Stern show) I stutter sometimes myself, and although not that bad I found this tip to be interesting. He said that he stopped stuttering when he did an impression of a character he made up. This character was a completely normal person, so it did not sound foolish when he talked. 

I stumbled upon this when my friend from Mexico was making fun of my gringo accent. I asked her, ""So how do you want me to talk?"" and I did an impersonation of a mexican speaking spanish. She laughed and said it was perfect. From there I refined my character. I seldom tell people, but whenever I'm speaking spanish, I do an impression of this character I created. He is a cowboy who grew up in south Mexico. He is suave as hell, and can handle all the tequilla you throw at him, he is confident, and his face is beaten hard by the desert sun. 

I know what you are thinking. What the fuck? But really, it works, for me at least. Some of the characteristics I gave him have little to do with accent, but sort of boosy my confidence when speaking spanish. 

This character helps me more than you can imagine. I get compliments all the time on my accent. From what people tell me, it sounds like it is from somewhere in the south of Mexico. 

I'm trying to develop characters for French and Mandarin, but it can be a little hard. Let me know if this helps you at all!",,False,self,t5_2rjsc,False,,,True,t3_lv6fp,http://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/lv6fp/a_weird_personal_tip_for_getting_a_great_accent_i/,

I tried the Dutch language and I am deeply disappointed. The placement test put me at B1 level of the EU language framework, which means I can participate a social conversation with some help.

When I started the course it went from the very beginning like presenting oneself, discussing a simple booking. The word training goes to exercise words like apple, tomato, cow, etc.

They claim that every day there is a piece of news read by a teacher which you can work with. In the last 3 months it is still the same piece of text and it is read by a machine.

The machine reader is very poor and useless. If you use it it will destroy your chance to pronounce anything properly.

Even in their 1st lesson (as well as lessons 2 and 3) there are missing material. There are screens with just “Text 1″ instead of the actual text.

You cannot repeat any lesson, once you have completed it.

Grammar explanation is very poor and limited. The explanation of a past time is just couple of lines and 4 examples. The examples are basically the same and there is no mentioning of irregular verbs whatsoever.

This certainly is not worth the extremely steep prices (1year = 1020 Euros!). Stay away!",,False,self,t5_2rjsc,False,,,True,t3_1gyg0n,http://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/1gyg0n/stay_away_from_onlinetrainerscom/,

Two months ago we left our academic careers in Italy and moved to San Francisco, where we are trying to pursue our dreams: we want to create a language exchange community that just works. 

We are currently [coding like crazy](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/1527923/awesome_days.jpg), and we are up since [three days](http://blog.coffeestrap.com/2012/02/16/we-are-excited-to-announce-that-coffeestrap-is-up-and-running/).

Simply put, we are creating a platform that automatically matches you up for a coffee with somebody who is around, shares your interests, and speaks the very languages you'd like to pick up. Doing that safely, effortlessly, with no frills, and no ads.

Something that just works, and notifies you the following:

OK Yuko, 28, from Japan, is now in Chicago, and is looking for people that want to speak English and Japanese. Catch up for a coffee at six o'clock on the corner between Madison and Franklin? YES || NO

We think this service has the potential to really improve the quality of life of all language exchangers, and we are trying to build it, right now.

We here asking your 2 cents: what does /r/languageexchange think about this? Are we getting it right? Should we improve something? What would you like to see implemented first, when we will release the version 0.9 in a week or two?

Ask Us Anything, Tell Us Anything. We really appreciate this.

If you do not own a Kindle, you can still get the book through a Kindle app for your phone, tablet or computer.

These are early editions of the books, so there may a couple of mistakes that myself, the translators and proof readers have missed. If you spot something that you think needs changing, please let me know about it and i'll get right on it.

Thanks for your time and i hope you enjoy the books.

1356710533.0,91,self.languagelearning,15krc0,"My short(ish) but detailed reviews of all the free services (that I have tried). FYI, slight bias towards Spanish, which I am learning.",bluepisces,101,10,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/15krc0/my_shortish_but_detailed_reviews_of_all_the_free/,"I guess it's worth noting here that my experience will obviously be different from those who learn differently than I do. I learn best by real hands on. Show me, tell me, then let me try it for myself. I seem to be apt at picking up new words quickly and retaining them easily, and I know this is not the case for everyone. I do know that when I am listening to a language and I hear a new word, I want to see how it is spelled, and ideally hear it isolated by itself as well.

*UPDATED - DEC 30 - Added another excellent Spanish resource*

**FYI the number ratings below are based on my opinion/value to me mostly, I've tried not to be too self biased so take with a grain of salt and think of it like this - if you read this and feel similarly to me/learn the same way I say I do, then the numbers will be more applicable to you**

Alright, I suppose I'll cover these in the order I found/tried them.

**Memrise**

Vocabulary builder at best, while some courses have audio for pronunciations, it has become painfully evident that if you only know words and not any grammar or proper verb conjugations, you will be no better than a dumb foreigner who knows how to say select words, and no one will likely be able to help you if you go to another country. (Now that I have tried Anki, I prefer it, with the exception of the lack of audio in most of the available community shared decks)

Pros - vocab building, depending on the course you can get a variety of words (ie household objects, verbs, directions, body parts) or get specific stuff.

Cons - very limited and one dimensional. Anki is better if you want to go the spaced repetition/memory building route.

* Reading 3
* Writing 3
* Listening Comprehension 4 (at least native speakers are on there)
* Ability to speak 4
* Overall usefulness 4 (unless you just want to know words, then I'd rate this higher, but it's 4 for me, it got me started)

**Duolingo**

Pretty good for teaching you to read a language, and write/listen to a lesser extent. I have spent the most time on Duolingo but am at a point now (2/3 through the Spanish course) where it is more frustrating than helpful, because I understand 90-90% of the sentences without peeking at word meanings, but alot of sentences don't translate literally, or even semi-literally. Or just because of the ordering of words Spanish uses (and that their grammar tends to, from the English perspective, create alot of redundancy that is difficult to back out when translating (ie all the se lo and te verb a ellos stuff). One ironic pro/con is the computer voice - it is at least consistent which helps me alot, but because it's not a real voice, I mishear alot of words or they blend together (ie when there's an a followed by a verb or noun beginning with a vowel, the a gets lost in the pronunciation so you kind of just have to know it's there). I'm glad there is the voice, even though it's fake, but I have seen the idea of crowd sourcing audio and I think that could work, but then you have the problem of different dialects/pronunciations. I know there is a difference between Mexican Spanish and Spain Spanish for example. I did briefly work on the French and German courses and I do plan to return to them, I enjoyed both (though the French is made even harder because plurals often are pronounced the same as singulars and the computer voice is absolutely zero help in that case)

But I will say if you want to mostly be able to read, but to a lesser extent speak/understand, then I recommend this one as one of the top 3.

Pros - teaches you to read, in my opinion very well. You do get an idea for what to listen for in sentences, so it does build some hearing comprehension and you can practice your accent.

Cons - gets harder the further you go, not just harder sentences, but the translations get more finicky (which I understand they are always trying to improve). computer voice has be more harm than help at times.

* Reading 10
* Writing 5
* Listening Comprehension 6.5 (it's a decent start)
* Ability to speak 5
* Overall usefulness 7-10 (depending on your intend ie only reading ability or reading/writing/speaking)

**SpanishDict.com**

Video lessons with some listening/writing/multiple choice test practice. I started using this site after getting about 1/3 through the duolingo course and it does a great job of explaining alot of quirks of the language and how in Spanish they don't say ""it is raining"" they say ""it is doing/making rain"", and it's not ""I am 20 years old"" it's ""I have 20 years of age"". That's just how it is in Spanish, but duolingo doesn't explain this so you're left wondering ""why do I *have* age and why doesn't the weather *be*?"". But I have found this site an excellent supplement in addition to duolingo, for a slightly different perspective and filling in the gaps left by each other.

Pros - the tutor speaks very clearly and explains things in a very nice, easy to understand way (ie they make it make sense without making you feel dumb). Exercises are good, if a little simple/sometimes redundant.

Cons - I feel a bit tired and bored sometimes after watching the longer videos, and I don't really feel that completing sentences within the video itself is the best thing for me. I don't seem to do well at them, I do better at the after video written stuff.

* Reading 7
* Writing 5
* Listening Comprehension 9
* Ability to speak 9
* Overall usefulness 8 (if you want to learn Spanish I definitely recommend this, I wish there was a French version).

**LiveMocha**

Found this one just over the christmas break.

What I find annoying/disappointing about this one is I find all the exercises fairly tedious, because there is SO much repetition of really basic things. However, it sneakily does alot vocabulary building without you really realizing how much you're getting. Probably the BEST (but also sometimes hardest on the sense of progress) feature is having actual natives review/offer feedback on your attempts (Spelling, grammar, pronunciation). That is definitely where LiveMocha shines. I have been making a concerted effort at paying careful attention to pronunciations (hence I've noticed the difference between south american and european Spanish) and I try to pronounce things correctly as much as possible. Some people are very nice, while others will be very strict and harsh and chew you out for getting the gender wrong on one thing.

Pros - supports several languages, interaction with natives to get real valuable feedback. But you may need to wear a helmet on your pride. I like the speaking exercises the most. You'll build vocabulary quickly (without having to try as hard as with Memrise) while getting the other stuff too.

Cons - review exercises (to me) can be very tedious.

* Reading 5
* Writing 7
* Listening Comprehension 8
* Ability to speak 8
* Overall usefulness 8

**Anki**

This has replaced Memrise for me, because it's customizable, and offline. I used it to make a deck for verbs and verb forms and to make a deck of single words that tend to be scattered through sentences (basically what we call the FANBOYS in English - for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so, etc). What I still need to do is add audio/images in some cases, but I like it because I abandoned Memrise due to much of the content of its courses being largely redundant/too basic for my purposes, so now I can make my own courses and study on my time, and I can control which words I need to be tested on a little better (ie if an easy word comes up I can banish it for 4 days, whereas on Memrise easy words will come up sometimes half a dozen times before it realizes that you get them and stops bugging you).

I still need to explore this one more but I'm enjoying it right now.

* Reading 5
* Writing 4 (or less if you don't input your own stuff)
* Listening Comprehension N/A (haven't had a deck with sound yet so unless you're saying the words out loud as they come up...)
* Ability to speak 2-3 (again depends on verbal practice)
* Overall usefulness 6 (good self studiers will get alot more from it)

**Babbel** (not free, but very cheap and I'm just going to touch on it briefly)

I used this one briefly a couple of days ago. You do get to try it for free, so it's worth mentioning. I did a grammar/verb tense exercise which involved giving me fill in the blank sentences to put the correct pronoun and verb tense. This is something I've been missing in all the other places for the most part (SpanishDict offeres it in various lessons but admittedly I've been lazy about doing them because their exercises are short and I want more). It's only $13/mo on the most expensive plan so to me, I think it's definitely worth at least a one month trial. It does seem to offer an approach that is just different enough from the others that it does test what you've actually learned. I have been learning from 4-5 different sources and I do feel I am getting a very good all around experience, this would add to that.

Pros (from limited experience) - seems to offer lessons in a unique way to complement your learnings from other sources. Tests you on if you know how to complete a sentence in proper context which is the one thing I feel I've been missing. Also supports several languages.

Cons - does not offer english translations for everything so you can know if you were right or if something meant what you thought.

* Reading 6 (loses points for not giving translations after you've answered)
* Writing 5 (fill in the blanks isn't really great writing practice, but did force me to get the right tense/spelling)
* Listening Comprehension 5 (I forget how much audio there was, but there was some)
* Ability to speak 5
* Overall usefulness 7

I give it a 7 because I feel it has alot of potential for me, I'll probably come back and update this after I've used it more (edit: http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2411398,00.asp). I know with the plethora of free services, why would I pay for one? Well like I said, every service has it's niche and Babbel does fill one, cheaply. I could get alot out of it in just a month. I just went back to check and I see that the free trial consists of only ONE lesson (of your choice), so you get a very small taste of it, but it was enough to convince me it was worth risking $13 for more so that should tell you something.

**SpanishPod101.com**

Also not free, but they have a deal where *you can get 7 days worth of access to their premium content for just $1*. I took the deal and it worked out awesome! for that $1 I was able to download their entire course through iTunes (all 11GB worth!), so I have everything even after my premium status ends. I'm extremely pleased with the service even so:

* they have lessons based on levels, but you can still get something from every lesson no matter your level
* they have realistic example interactions/conversations, explain regional vs general idioms and they also often give examples of things like differences between (ie) creer &amp; penser or enconter &amp; saber.
* each episode has a conversation, then they slow it down, then they go back to normal speed and translate after each person's line, and give some extra context, they also have specific vocab for each lesson and break that down too
* transcripts in both languages
* they have a vocab and grammar section at the end plus a final review
* practice exercises
* episodes are tpyically 10-15 mins each.

**My Recommendation:**

* Start with Duolingo if you want to learn one of the languages it supports (now up to 5 - Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Italian, more on the way)
* If learning Spanish, I HIGHLY recommend also doing *SpanishDict.com* and *spanishpod101.com* lessons at the same time. Fortunately there's very little overlap (for redundancy which I hate) except for verbs/pronouns/grammar which are important and good.
* If learning another language, LiveMocha is a great secondary tool, but be prepared to have the natives dissect your writing/speaking. If you want to REALLY learn properly and impress the natives, put in the effort even if it takes longer.
* Anki for vocabulary building and custom practice of whatever you think you need more help to remember (the fact that it's custom puts it SO far above memrise in my mind, customizability is ALWAYS good, you can trim the fat and refine your learning)

**Final Recommendations:**

* Best for Reading **Duolingo**
* Best for Writing **LiveMocha**
* They are kind of tied for the last 2 categories.
* SpanishDict + spanishpod101 for listening comprehension and speaking (if you're learning Spanish)

Final Tips:
* Immersion is DEFINITELY key. Read, write, listen and speak a little every day. I have literally been doing this every day for basically just 2 weeks and I am actually kind of shocked at how far I've come.

I know people are fooled by Rosetta Stone's marketing ploys.  I will be the first to admit their marketing is the best in the business, but they offer one of the worst products ever.


They really don't teach you much.  They teach you random words and sentences that aren't helpful.  If you want to learn how to say ""The ball is blue"" then Rosetta stone if for you.  It isn't even worth using for free imo.  Their voice recognition software is terrible.  This is one thing they love to market and well it is not true.  It will only recognize a hard American accent of the language you are learning.  Native speakers of the language have trouble getting their words recognized with perfect accents.


Now I know you will say ""Then what is better Jhoiz""?
Well, that depends on your language and what you want to do with that language. Most people say they want to be fluent, but do they really have the dedication needed? No, they don't.  The best thing you can do is ask yourself how much time you are willing to put forward and what your goal is.  


If I haven't convinced you here is a good article of someone who has more experience than me at learning languages. [Check it out here](http://www.fluentin3months.com/rosetta-stone-review/)

I am just trying to give people information so they can make a good decision.

It's a tough language for me to understand and I think I'm less naturally ""gifted"" at absorbing languages than others (even though I have a pretty good sense for grammar, etc.), so it's been a real journey.

Tonight while I was speaking Portuguese with my partner, I finished a sentence correctly without thinking.  I had no prior knowledge of this rule, nor had I really come across this particular phrase before, but I somehow ""knew"" anyway that I could apply ""que sim"" to the end of a sentence and it would work.

I'm being abstract because the specific example isn't that important (and honestly I can't remember exactly what I said now), but I never expected my brain to be able to put together sentences in a second language by itself like I am now.  

When I started learning, a friend told me that one day I'd have a moment like this (which he called a ""eureka moment"") where I would reply to something without really realizing I was doing it or something along those lines, and although this may seem silly to a lot of people (and honestly I am questioning whether or not I should post this even as I type it), the realization that I am somehow capable of doing something like that, and that I'm actually growing and getting better in my second language (a life goal) has made me feel extraordinary.

With Brazilian Portuguese as my second language, I'd like to share the quirkier side of it as I worked my may towards fluency. ",thewhitedeath,88,14,77,http://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/177g03/every_language_has_their_quirks_idiosyncrasies/,"BP is spoken differently all over the country. I have learned and speak it the way it is spoken in the major centers of Brazil. Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. The following insights may not hold true in other areas of Brazil. Some I know actually don't.

I'll begin with one of the most indispensable words in the English language: 'Yes'.

Brazilians have decided that this word (Sim) is pretty much 'dead weight' and have thrown it to the curb. Though obviously still part of the language, it's rarely used. If you ask a question in BP that in English would receive a 'Yes' answer, in BP you will get the conjugated verb repeated back to you.

Example 1: Did you buy the car? (Você comprou o carro?)
Answer: Comprei. (not yes)

Example 2: Did you clean your room? (Você arrumou seu quarto?)
Answer: Arrumei.

BP is a very pro-drop language. If they don't need to say it, they won't. Reflexive verbs? Who needs em? We're not using them. They tend to drop all the 'Its' as well. Did you buy it? Bought. Did you clean it? Cleaned. Did you see it? Saw. No need for all those 'its' cluttering things up.

Very, very common. Even questions that almost demand a yes answer won't get one. They'll literally get 'This' instead: Isso (this).

Example: ""Did you drop this hundred dollar bill on the ground sir?""
Answer: ""Isso"".

You can go weeks without ever saying 'Yes' in BP.

Now if Brazilians don't like using 'Yes', they practically have a love affair with 'No'. (Não). Throwing it around everywhere they can. My favorite sentence in BP has 4 words and three of them are 'No':

 Não não é não! (No it isn't). The dreaded triple negative in English. Perfectly fine in BP.

Borrowed words from English. There are hundreds of borrowed words lifted from English used by Brazilians. Internet. Hot Dog. Laptop. Sandwich. Ketchup. The list goes on. The fun thing about this is that they love to stick an 'E' on the end of every one of them. Makes for some fun words to say:

Laptop - Lapee Topee. 

Hot Dog - Hotchee Dogee

Ketchup - Ketchupee

Sandwich - Sandweeshee.

And just for the sheer absurd fun of it...

King Kong - Kingee Kongee.

Really interesting and fun.

And just to finish up, my favorite idiom. Maluca Da Silva. (Crazy person). Da Silva is far and away the most common surname in Brazil. Maluca = Crazy. Stick the two together and Voila! Maluca Da Silva.",,False,self,t5_2rjsc,1359060968.0,,,True,t3_177g03,http://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/177g03/every_language_has_their_quirks_idiosyncrasies/,

I've used this method for a long time, for several different languages, and it's worked great. With a few sheets of paper and 30-45 minutes, you can learn at least 50 new vocabulary words per day.

On this subreddit we usually see the most advanced or the most beginner discussions. We see those like Benny who have arguably mastered Language Learning, or testimony of how someone listened to 20,000 hours and just 'absorbed' a new language. According to flair, the majority of the people who post here are C2 in 7 languages. 
On the flip side, we see post that asks, ""Anybody know how to pick a language to learn?"", ""Can I learn 7 languages at once? Yolo"", or ""Podcast in espanol amigos!? XD""

*I think that's great. This subreddit has been a fountain of resources for me in my language learning adventure so far
However, I think there is a quiet minority (maybe majority) here that may be in the middle of learning their first foreign language.
I want us to focus on them.
For you intermediates:
*  Perhaps you've hit a plateau, or haven't had the chance to immerse. * Maybe you're making awesome progress and can share your small stories of success with us.
* What are your experiences overcoming the 'stage fright' of having those first real conversations with a native? 

Maybe more advanced members of the community can share their motivation for the intermediate, or how they made it over the 'hump'.

I'll start with my experiences in the comments :)

I describe the scene, what I did that day, where I'm going, what I said, etc.. (with many mistakes and unknown words, of course)

When I see my French friend, I give him the notebook and he corrects everything. He gives me new words, phrases, and grammatical structures which I use in the following days' journals. We then talk about everything I wrote about in French. It makes my new vocabulary and usage very easy to remember because it's all associated with parts of my live, and all the things I learn are thngs I'm actually trying to say/use. It's been about 6 months and I just returned from a 2 week trip in France where I did reasonably well holding conversations for 10-15 minutes at a time without switching back to English.

1368000485.0,62,self.languagelearning,1dx60q,Here is how I have lived in France for four years and managed to not learn French.,devilsadvocado,67,5,100,http://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/1dx60q/here_is_how_i_have_lived_in_france_for_four_years/,"I'm a 29-year-old American mec who chased a girl here in February 2009. The plan was to stay for four months. It's been more than four years. 

When I first arrived, I was eager to become fluent even though I had zero base in the language. My initial efforts were upset however when I learned that 1) many French people are intolerant of foreigners; 2) French is not a language you can speak ""brokenly"", you've got to speak it correctly (pronunciation and grammar ) in order to be understood; and 3)  just because you are living in a foreign country does not mean that you are immersed in that country's culture. I was speaking English with all my students, colleagues, mates (a pretty international group of friends) and family (my wife comes from an international family). Even when I tried to speak French with people in the shops or other strangers that I randomly met, 95% of the time they would respond to me in English even though I approached them in French. *Le sigh.*

So here I am in France, speaking and listening to English 95% of the day. I can use my free time to either study French or pursue my passion (screenwriting) and after some months of discouragement I basically never touched a French book again.  

After having lived in the country for about a year, I started to encounter what I call ""language bullies."" There are many, many of them here in France; perhaps the government hires them as defenders of French heritage. I encounter these types frequently. They ask me how long I've been living in France. ""What, you've been living in France for one year and you're not fluent? Aren't you ashamed of yourself? How is it possible? Is something wrong with you?"" (I even had pricks berating me for not being fluent after having only lived here six months.) These assholes discouraged me (and continue to discourage me) even more, and I became more settled than ever to just stay in my little English bubble and wait for my wife to finish school so that we could move back to America.

So here I am after four years and I basically speak at a lower intermediate level. I have a crazy teaching schedule coupled with a crazy family schedule (new baby) and it would be hard to make time to practice French even if I wanted to. I'm encouraged by the fact that I've met other people in my situation (long-time foreign residents who haven't picked up the language) and even read in Ernest Hemmingway's biography that he never managed to learn French despite having lived in Paris for 8 years. He depended on his wife, who was fluent, just like I depend on mine for certain practical matters. *Bows head in shame.*

Sometimes I'll get re-inspired to take another serious go at becoming fluent, and am actually considering an intensive study this summer (which would mean temporarily abandoning my writing hobby). I'd appreciate any encouragement from the community, since I certainly don't get any here.",,False,self,t5_2rjsc,1368000845.0,,,True,t3_1dx60q,http://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/1dx60q/here_is_how_i_have_lived_in_france_for_four_years/,

A lot of people will disagree with it, but I just think there is a lot of bullshit going around this subreddit.

One of the most ridiculous things I've been seeing is a lot of posts about people claiming to learn/want to learn like 8 languages. Now, it's certainly possible to accomplish this over a lifetime, but the way these posts come about is ridiculous. the typical one is something like this.

&gt; Hey reddit, so I am at a C1 level in French because I am level 10 on duolingo so I think i'll get by fine in Paris. So I'm going to start learning sPanish, Italian, Russian and Arabic. I am using online resources, will it take me 2 or 3 years to be fluent in all of these?

Honestly, I can guarantee you that person will never know another language fully. I'm not saying that self-study is bad or anything, but honestly I think we need to be far more realistic about language learning in general. 

Because of where I live, I encounter people that know 2-4 languages on a daily bases. Not one of them that I've talked to has learned a language by self study. Typically, they lived/studied/worked in another country, and took classes before. Obviously, if you really work hard at a self-study program, immersion could do wonders for you, but just self studying will make very little progress. 

About learning languages at the same time: It is certainly possible, there is no doubting that. However, learning at the same level, especially with similar languages, makes it all the more difficult. French Intermediate starting Korean? No problem there. Beginning Italian and Spanish at the same time? Terrible idea.

Basically, everything you read here take with a grain of salt. Most people here are in the process of learning their first or maybe second foreign language. About 25-40% of things posted here, especially flair, is bullshit. Look for anyway of validating a person's knowledge of a language before trusting their advice, unless you can verify it with a source outside of this subbreddit.

Lastly, I really do love this subreddit, contrary to what this post implies. it is a great way of sharing resources, tips, and the like. But like all of Reddit, it gets out of hand and there is a lot of bullshit that is inherently difficult to detect, but the aggregate of that bullshit becomes pretty obvious.

Usually I'm kinda busy and on the move and only have the time to earnestly study Spanish and Mandarin. This is something quickish and easy.

* Go to a site with text in your langauge. It can be a news site, wikipedia, just something from native speakers. The closer it is to your interests (e.g. a gaming site), the better. I use news sites and old magazines.
* Pick a ""piece."" Usually this'll be an article. 
* Get a piece of paper. And a pen. Or use your smart-devices note thing; just get a thing that can write and is portable.
* Read your piece for a while, and underline the words you don't know.
* Write down the translations of the words on your thing.
* Carry your thing with you throughout the day and look at it during little spare moments. On the elevator, in the metro, waiting for something to microwave, etc.

So yeah, it's a small thing I do that's pretty easy. It doesn't require much management/thought.

All at once, and suddenly I don't have to ask people to slow down. Well, at least not all the time.  I have been pretty slow to acquire understanding of Portuguese because in my region (Porto, Portugal), it is spoken really quickly and without many pauses, plus the accent is a bit thick.  Imagine learning English in Scotland, and you have a pretty good idea of what I'm talking about.

I'm surprised at the very least -- the day before, I still had trouble. The next day, I didn't. When people say progress in language acquisition happens in sudden jumps, they aren't joking. 

I still don't know every word, but now when I don't understand something I know why I don't, and I know what word or phrase to ask about, instead of the stuff I don't understand coming out as a blur of sounds. And now, I'm addicted. I can't stop listening to Portuguese things. I'm so confused. Last time I made a post here I said this, and I'll say it again: the human brain is so weird.

I just wanted to share this experience, because it has been by far the most emotional one I've had.  I'm not big on self-esteem sometimes, and I have at many times thought of giving up, or thought I might just not be cut out to learn a second language.  And although I'm still not there (yes, I'm pretty slow) I feel for the first time ready to communicate with native speakers.  It is as though an enormous weight has been lifted from my shoulders.

I would also really like to hear from people with similar experiences, as wanting to feel connected is, I guess, part of the human experience. :P",,False,self,t5_2rjsc,False,,,True,t3_16onsj,http://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/16onsj/sudden_jumps_in_language_acquisition/,

I have a weekend project that could be relevant to your interests.  
I think it's better to direct you to the project README: http://github.com/pcboy/pixmory

To put it in a nutshell. This is basically an Anki Deck generator.  
From a simple list of comma separated words, I'm generating a deck containing:  

On the Front side of each flashcard:

* The word in the source language
* A relevant picture (taken from the beautiful pictures at fotopedia.com (or google if unavailable))

On the back side:

* The translation coming from WordReference (furigana are included for Japanese)
* A sample sentence taken from the tatoeba project
* The pronunciation taken from forvo.com (so, native people, not a tts)

I started to use it and that's fairly good so far.  
Of course this is not perfect, homonyms can be a problem, but I'm still impressed, 98% of the time the flashcards are perfect.

This is just the start of the project. I don't want to limit myself to languages neither. I want to develop a full suite to remember things efficiently.

It's open source, under the WFTPL. It's still in alpha, full of debug and such. I don't have a lot of time to work on it and I thought people could already benefit from it at this stage.

Feel free to give advices/recommendations!

So I've been noticing a lot of threads about the practicality/usefulness of learning certain languages. I thought maybe we could sum up thoughts on this (maybe add to the sidebar?) since it seems to be a reoccurring theme. 

here are some things to consider:

**Personal interest:** If you hate kayaking, and can't stand rivers, and just despise getting wet, you probably will never learn to kayak worth a damn. The same applies to language learning. I loved learning Spanish, which made it easier to practice it, thus a good choice. I tried a bit of Dutch and that just didn't click for me, so naturally i didn't continue it. IMO, if you're not interested in a language or don't find it worthwhile, don't bother. the one exception being if you NEED to learn it, which brings me to me next point.


**Necessity:** Maybe your new job is in Italy or you're joining the Peace Corps. I don't know. But either way, if you need to learn a language, that is probably the best way to learn.  when you are forced to practice (especially immersion) your efforts will reward you and you will pick up the language much faster. Even if you don't like it, the need factor will make it so that you eventually get the hang of it.


**Level of commitment:** the last thing i'd consider. Are you going to take a formal class? eventually visit? self study? This is a very very important factor. Different languages will be easier/harder based on your native tongue, languages you've been exposed to, cultural familiarity, and plain personal preferences. For example, someone who has never left Wyoming [rural part of America for non-US redditors] you will probably make very little progress self-studying Cantonese. But if, let's say, you know Spanish, English, and Portuguese, you could probably make good progress self-studying French. 


**Practicality:** I would say this is the least important but still something to consider. Well, if languages are just a hobby for you, this isn't something to consider. But if you hope to use it for career advancement, it is. there is no ""best language to learn"" but each area has better choices. For example, if you are in business, Mandarin or Russian would be an excellent choice. Wolof, not so much. Or if you live in a community with a lot of Spanish speakers, it would probably be a better choice than Hmong.

1361329473.0,49,self.languagelearning,18v243,Michel Thomas method - a short subjective review,kewlar,55,6,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/18v243/michel_thomas_method_a_short_subjective_review/,"Someone asked me to do a short review of my experience with Michel Thomas method, so there goes.

I have completed MT French (Foundation, Advanced, some Vocabulary), Spanish (Foundation), German (Foundation Review, as I had German in school), and now am in the process of learning Italian (Foundation and Advanced completed, Vocabulary in progress). I have also tried some Pimsleur and Rosetta Stone, and now am trying Duolingo and Memrise. I found Pimsleur to be seriously unsuitable for my needs (repetitive, boring, impractical parrotting). Rosetta Stone - slow, boring, and expensive, but may be suitable as a complementary tool. I have mixed feelings about Duolingo and Memrise at the moment.

If you don't know about Michel Thomas method, [Wikipedia lays the gist of it out](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Thomas_Method), [Rose Lee Hayden explains Michel Thomas' ""ground rules""](http://vimeo.com/38088530), and [there are some samples on the website](http://www.michelthomas.com). Basically, it teaches you the ""structure of the language"" - i.e. sentence structure, verbs and how to use them (tenses and conjugations), teaches you to think in the target language, some practical vocabulary and pronunciation tips. Then it's up to you to build the vocabulary - Michel recommended reading, and I found that it worked for me.

Things I liked about the Michel Thomas courses:

* It enabled me to think in and to construct sentences (i.e. speak) in my target language. At his prompts, I often found myself saying not only the sentence I was prompted to say, but also muttering a few similar ones I could easily find myself saying in a practical situation.
* I was able to do that a relatively short amount of time (in approx. two weeks, listening to MT courses while commuting).
* I can learn while commuting. Or having a walk.
* The thing of building the structure first - it works!.
* The thing about building vocabulary by reading a little every day - it works!.
* Michel stresses the parts that matter (ex. Italian word endings -e and -i that change the meaning of the sentence), and leaves out the parts that are not important.
* Also, Michel teaches the practical pronunciation - the way it's actually spoken in the country (ex. in France you'll almost never hear ""je -- ne -- sais -- pas"" -- with pauses between words. It's more like ""je'n'sais-pas"").
* The ""ground rules"" of relaxing and letting the teacher to be responsible for the progress are a nice touch.
* It worked for me (tested in Morocco, France, Spain, and Italy. Was able to get directions, order food, settle conflicts, get out of tight places, haggle, and hold a few light conversations).

Things that could be better:

* It seems to me, that sometimes the usage of some specific small words could be understood easier, if I had seen how they're written. It can easily be solved with a complementary learning tool, like Rosetta Stone, or Duolingo, or Memrise. **Update** as [shrillthrill](http://www.reddit.com/user/shrillthrill) pointed out, the phrases taught are in the booklets available both in printed form, and as a PDF download, so that solves it. You still need to look it up.
* Some courses are better than others. Some are less good. In his Italian course, it seems to me that at one point Michel Thomas misunderstands his students and goes on a tangent about differences between ""want"" and ""won't"". Seems like his hearing was getting worse at the time. The French course, on the other hand, was excellent.
* Vocabulary courses periodically annoy me to no end. The woman in the Italian courses constantly messes up -i and -e endings where they matter, whereas Michel always made a point to pronounce them correctly, because they do matter. Also, Vocabulary courses don't seem focus on making sure you remember what's on them that much - the material is not repeated as much as in the grammar courses. Then again, it may not matter much.
* The vocabulary taught is minimal. There are things that are lacking, like basic directions, counting etc. On the other hand, that is easily acquired with any phrasebook or a simple Google search.

Things that have to be solved by other means:

* It does not teach reading. Or writing. It's an audio course, deal with it. If you need reading/writing, there are tools for that.
* It does not teach listening skills. That I found out the practical way - ""shit, I know I asked for directions correctly, and I know I was understood, but I have no idea what he's saying"". You get over it in a couple of days in the target environment.

If you decide to try it, I have a couple of personal tips:

* When the material got difficult, I found that I retained the material better if I relaxed, and listened to every disc twice (usually in the morning and in the evening, or on two consecutive days), instead of trying harder to remember.
* When you'll have to use your newly acquired language skills in a practical situation in a foreign country, you may find it a bit difficult to remember words you need, to formulate sentences you never had to formulate before, and to understand what's being said to you. Relax, it's only natural. Your brain will adjust to using and understanding the new language quite quickly, and you'll feel like your're making exponential progress.

It's not by any means the silver bullet to language acquisition and retainment (I just found it to be the best for me) -- then again, no single method is. You have to have to use the language in order to retain it, and to progress in it.

There are some who complain about Michel's pronunciation, and that they'd prefer it if it was a native speaker. Maybe it's just me, but I liked that his pronunciation teaching is geared towards the beginner learner, and that he makes sure to teach the parts that are important in order to be understood.

In the end, I found it to be the method that works for me. YMMV, but I hope this will encourage you to try it.

TL;DR: Try it, if you can stomach hearing an old man speak. It's great for building the foundation of the language, and it's even better in combination with text-based methods.

1331048955.0,44,self.languagelearning,qk8vh,"While learning Portuguese, this subreddit has been a huge help to me.  As thanks, I thought I'd post something to help people learning English as a second language.",risemix,49,5,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/qk8vh/while_learning_portuguese_this_subreddit_has_been/,"If you're learning English in a country that doesn't use English very often, there's a strong chance you use a lot of uncommon linguistic conventions that come out sounding strange, unusual, or formal.  Here are a few:

1.  The word ""fine"" is not the same as ""good"" or ""well.""  It means ""OK.""  If someone says they are ""fine,"" it means they are doing OK, their lives are normal, and not especially good or bad.  ""Fine"" is used often in statements of neutrality.  Saying to a native English speaker that you ""hope that they are fine"" sounds a little funny, even though we know what you're trying to say. ;)

2. English speakers use the verb ""to do"" to answer imperatives and commands.  When using the future tense, the verb is often implied.  ""Clean your room"" is answered by saying ""I did,"" or ""I will [do it]"" in every day speech.  For speakers of Romance languages, this can cause a bit of confusion, since they tend to use the issued verb when responding to commands.  ""I cleaned,"" ""I washed,"" and so on are understandable but sound funny. ;)

3. English is very descriptive and flexible and English speakers tend to use adjectives for a lot of things that you tend to ""have"" in romance languages.  English speakers are ""ticklish"" but don't ""have tickles.""  

4. When differentiating between ""in,"" ""of,"" and on,"" it is often not literal.  You ride ""on"" the train, but stand ""in"" a house.  Spain is a country ""in"" the world and not a country ""of"" the world (although ""of"" is sometimes used here, too).  In many cases, it is possible to differentiate by deciding how something is physically placed.  You aren't on top of a line, so you're waiting ""in"" it.  In some cases, it is not: despite not being on top of the airplane, saying you're ""on"" a plane is perfectly acceptable because it is something you boarded.

4. When describing groups of people, English speakers do not use the same convention as romance languages.  Instead of saying ""we are three,"" we might say ""there are three of us.""  Saying ""we are three"" might mean you are then asked, ""three of what?""  Three doctors?  Three adults? 

6. If you want to refer to something that exists in regionally within a country or political location, remember that English has adjectives to describe cardinal locations.  Montpellier is not in the ""south of France,"" but in ""southern France.""  In English, Spain and the Mediterranean Sea are ""south of France,"" but Paris is in ""northern France.""

finally managed to find the time in between writing my thesis to complete [Polyglot Link](http://polyglotlink.com). It's barebones at the moment, but I thought I'd get it out sooner than later.

Currently it has 35 blogs in the database. You'll notice some languages only have one or two blogs listed. But hey, it's a start!

*Edit: I'll be contacting bloggers to continue adding their blogs. If you're disappointed at the lack of blogs in your language of choice at the moment &amp; want to stay up-to-date on new blogs added to the site you can [subscribe to the newsletter](http://eepurl.com/oS_iH).*

[Chinese](http://polyglotlink.com/language/mandarin) has by far the most language learning blogs at the moment, but this is due to the fact that I'm part of the Chinese blogging community.

I would love to see more blogs from other languages there. You can submit your own by submitting it [here](http://polyglotlink.com/addblog).

Naturally there is also a [blog for Polyglot Link](http://blog.polyglotlink.com) where I'll post about language learning, specific language intricacies and just how awesome languages are. I'm looking for guest bloggers if anyone is interested.

In the end, I hope you find a blog you like. I think that there are some extremely valuable content out there from language learners documenting their experiences. If you don't have a blog yet, I urge you start one. I'll be the first to follow it. I'm obsessed I know.

2) offers extras built in like flashcards, basic grammar rules etc. 
3) All the learning (vocab/grammar/pronunciation) should follow some path set out for the learner, so its not overwhelming, and everything builds on previous learning (vs vocab apps that throw every random word at you at once).

Among other things.,thewhitedeath,58,14,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/1bfrbv/pronunciation_of_titanic_in_brazilian_portuguese/,"My wife is Brazilian and I speak the language. Nearly fluent but there is still some vocabulary i don't know. Yesterday in the car we were speaking Portuguese and the topic of The Titanic came up. I didn't have a clue what she was saying.

To preface, BP borrows a lot of words from English and adds their own pronunciation to them.  Usually by sticking an 'E' on the end of any word that ends with a consonant. Picnic = picnickee, internet = internetchee, iphone - iphoneee etc... it's cute.

 They also have 'T's that sound like 'ch' (the word 'type' in english = tipo in BP, pronounced 'cheepo'.

'D's that sound like 'J's. In English the phrase 'too much' is 'demais' in BP. pronounced 'je-mice'. lots of fun to learn.

Now on to Titanic. Of all the words in Brazilian portuguese and ones they've borrowed from English, this one takes the cake. I couldn't stop laughing. Pronunciation? (Chee-tah-nee-kee). What? I had to break it down syllable by syllable before it made any sense to me.

You've got your 'T' that sounds like 'Ch' to begin the word. normal. 'I's sound like 'ee' in BP, not 'eye' like in english. fair enough. thus the first syllable 'Chee' not 'Ti'.

next syllable 'ta'. not much changes here. the 'a' is a bit softer than in english but not so different.

next syllable 'nic'. they break it into two syllables. 'nee' and 'kee'. like I said, 'I's sound like 'ee' thus the 'nee' and as Brazilians are want to do, they stick an extra 'E' on the end of the word giving us the 'kee' finish. Chee-tah-nee-kee. fun!

The word Titanic is a powerful word in english. Something of enormous strength, size and power. Now I love the portuguese language but their pronunciation of Titanic is a little silly sounding to my ear and doesn't seem to carry the same strength it has in English. Just another fun little insight into my second language.",,False,self,t5_2rjsc,False,,,True,t3_1bfrbv,http://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/1bfrbv/pronunciation_of_titanic_in_brazilian_portuguese/,

I believe I've come up with a solid approach for efficient learning of reading, speaking and listening:

1. Learn the tones.
For this I use [McGraw-Hill's Chinese Pronunciation Software](http://www.amazon.com/McGraw-Hills-Chinese-Pronunciation-CD-ROM-Live/dp/0071627367) and quiz myself with the [BBC Tones Game](http://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/chinese/games/tones.shtml)

It takes a while before you get the feel for the tones, but with the BBC quiz the progress is traceable. 

2. Learn 25 Characters a day including their Pinyin form with the [HSK 1 Memrise Flashcard series](http://www.memrise.com/course/541/hsk-level-1-introductory-mandarin/)
In the beginning you could go a bit faster, if you're motivated. If you finish this flashcard series and work on your listening skills, then you could go for the HSK Level 1 Exam! 

3. Learn grammar and sentence construction through [ChinesePod.com](http://www.chinesepod.com) or put it all together using Rosetta's Stone. (Costly Option - but if you search the webs all these resources can be found for free, including the McGraw-Hill Software)

4. For speaking I just repeat every sound I hear in Memrise and the McGraw-Hill Software, as well as repeating sentences from ChinesePod/Rosetta Stone/Pimsleurs. When I feel I get to a conversational level, I will use [Verbling](http://www.verbling.com) to exchange English/Dutch for Mandarin training. 

If you're looking for only free resources, the BBC Tone Game and the Memrise flashcards will get you a head start for when [Duolingo](http://www.duolingo.com) introduces Mandarin Chinese! (Hopefully by the end of this year)

Eventually I also aim to be able to write characters as it will help with retention, I've found [Skritter](http://www.skritter.com) to offer this training service, but I'll need an Tablet or Drawing Pad for this. 

Hope this helps! Leave feedback/suggestions.  ",,False,self,t5_2rjsc,False,,,True,t3_13i5qj,http://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/13i5qj/my_approach_for_tackling_mandarin_chinese/,

I get asked this a lot.  I only stumbled on this subreddit last night.  It's awesome.  Here is my most common method (I like to mix it up).

1. Find an audio piece of media Arabic (I like the Euronews ch on youtube)
2. Ensure it has a transcript (hence Euronews), otherwise how the hell can you confirm what you heard is correct?  Feedback is important.
3. Listen 2-3 times (I usually wait to take notes until #3 if I am writing in English.)
4. Transcribe the part that confuses you most (It's the three sentences where you only wrote ""Minister... Beirut... 27"").
5. Play the audio 2-3 times &amp; read along (I emphasize this to Ss... It helps me read at an ""Arab pace"" aka ""Al Jazeera Ticker"" pace).
6. Check your transcription and identify unknown/forgotten words in the passage
7. Use those words in context to create a ""news"" article.  Do this out-loud... if you write it first, it will be too perfect and you are not forcing yourself to work on your speaking  (Be sure to sign off for Al Jazeera... always from Occupied Jerusalem).
8. Now write out that news article.  I create traditional vocab lists for Ss because they demand them.  Otherwise I study vocab in this context.
9. Profit
10. Wash and repeat.

I only put a few rules on this method for Ss
A. The piece must be recent and relevant.
B. If they are legitimately getting 80% right off the bat, the passage is too easy.  Increase the difficulty.  Same thing if you only get 20%.  Maybe that 8 minute piece on Europe's green economy was too much for you.

It combined family friendly elements including profiles of individual learners, social media activism, local community drives and a light (pretty dumbed down) exploration of some sociolinguistic issues of endangered languages and adult language learning. Show was produced by Irish state TV station RTÉ. Bród is Irish for ""Pride"".  


*A little more detail about why I'm interested*  

I'm not so interested in well known formats like [Let's Speak Korean](http://www.arirang.co.kr/Tv/Tv_About_Content.asp?PROG_CODE=TVCR0110&amp;MENU_CODE=100063&amp;code=Po2&amp;sys_lang=Eng) or the various series NHK has created. Nor am I so focussed on whether I personally like or dislike the formats and features of the innovations.  

I'm just keen to get a survey of what is being tried for comparison. I'm especially interested in examples of new approaches that either combine education with entertainment to spur language interest and  learning and those that are specifically focussed on endangered or minority languages.

It's an MMORPG that is now free to play and is notorious for being one of the most expensive games ever created.  The game is Free to Play, and there is an option to install the entire game in any of 3 languages, French, German or English.  The game has tons of dialogue and voice acting, all with complete voice overs in either of these 3 languages.  I've been playing in French these past few days and I'm trying to get a second install in German on my computer so that I can passively learn that language too.  Just figured I would post since I feel it is helping me a lot.  I feel its the closest I've come to immersion without being in country.  If you let it hook you that is...

I use it for Dutch, but it works in most common languages.",JJTheJetPlane5657,42,2,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/166849/my_chrome_extension_power_combo_i_use_it_for/,"Many of you have probably heard of the [Polyglot extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/polyglot/plpjkjplknknmhfhkjgcfgofclmlnine?hl=en). It's a great extension, imparts language learning into my daily life (since it's being shoved in my face), and I think it does a great job of selecting different words every time. 

But I personally like to hear the words pronounced, too. Now the polyglot extension doesn't do this (unless I'm wrong, but I don't think I am). For that I present to you [Chrome Speak](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chrome-speak/mgpmlgbbboameedkldbfbhoigbabcbhk?hl=en). 

Chrome speak is like the [Google Dictionary extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-dictionary-by-goog/mgijmajocgfcbeboacabfgobmjgjcoja?hl=en), where in it has a built in text-to-speech function. The one thing I really like about this extension is that it has a built in right-click menu button. Also, it does a pretty good job of pronouncing words. At least in Dutch, I haven't tried any of the other languages.

Be aware that while the voice list is in alphabetical order, there's a big chunk of languages under ""European Language *insert language*"". At first I was sad because I couldn't find Dutch, but it's actually under ""European Language Dutch Female"". Also, if for whatever reason you don't like the way the computer is pronouncing things in one language, there are two other engines you can look at (this might also help if you can't find your desired language).

With Polyglot I can see the words, and with Chrome Speak I can hear them. It's really great. Also, for Polyglot I suggest checking the ""show original word in parenthesis"" option. I find that really helpful, but intermediate users might not want that option. Just something I think you should know is there.

Either way, try it out and let me know what you think! 

Also, I don't use any other browsers so unfortunately I can't suggest anything similar. Hopefully some Firefox/Opera users will be able to chime in with some comparable apps. 

Edit: I'm not the developer for any of these extensions, I'm just a person who uses Google Chrome. So I don't really know how to fix it if it's not working. My suggestion is to try closing Chrome completely, and then opening it again. If not, try uninstalling and re-installing the app. If not STILL, try making sure Chrome is up to date.

When the Borders near me was shutting down, I picked this up at the 70-90% off sale, and I picked it up because why not?  It turns out that it is a hidden gem that I intend to keep and use for a long time.

The first half of the book is a history of English and other languages that relate to it.  The book was written post-WWII, and the author's opinions definitely show that.  If you can get over that, though, the real gem is the last half of the book.

He has chosen 2000 vocabulary words for 8 non-English languages.  He says that he chose these words not because they are the most frequent words, but because with these words, you can express most of what you would want to say in a given language.  He distinctly avoided common words that have many meanings or could be translated incorrectly.  So, words like ""go"" or ""have"" are not in the list.

Even more interesting is that he groups the Teutonic and Romance languages together so you can see the similarities between the languages like this:


&gt; English - air

&gt; Swedish - luft

&gt; Danish - Luft

&gt; Dutch - lucht

&gt; German - die Luft

and this:

&gt; English - air

&gt; French - l'air (m)

&gt; Spanish - el aire

&gt; Portuguese - o ar

&gt; Italian - l'aria

I am learning only Russian at the moment, so I haven't tried using these lists myself.  Someday when I want to branch into multiple other languages, I will come back to it.  I wanted to share, though, with others who have expressed an interest in multiple languages at once.

What's great is that you can change the default language and then read it in the language you are learning, so I have been reading Donald Duck in German.

At my level of German I still need to translate lots of words on the go, and since this is much faster with an offline dictionary, I use Wordlens.

It still is a bit of a pain to switch between the Disney app and Wordlens, then type the word in to translate, plus I don't really remember the word after I have translated it, and it is not really feasible to add words to Memrise on the go.

What I would like to see if an e-reading app - for comic books or regular books - where if you tap a word you get the translations. If you needed to tap a word then it automatically goes in to a Memrise lesson you have set up. Then, if you encounter that word again in the same or a different text, reading it and *not* clicking it would count as having 'remembered' the word, as in a normal Memrise session, whereas tapping it again would count as not having remembered the word. All this would be sync'd to Memrise.

Then later, you can just go directly to Memrise to drill in those words you really can't remember and you have a list already built up from something that interested you. Then you can test yourself by going back to the test.

I am a university senior in the US, and have a job lined up that should presumably give me the opportunity to work abroad in Western Europe within the next 5 years. Obviously, English is my first language, and I took Spanish throughout high school and several semesters of college. After receiving my job offer, I became determined to solidify my fluency in Spanish and learn at least one (preferably two) more European languages.


At first, I thought Rosetta Stone was the be-all end-all to language learning (which really says something about their marketing), so I downloaded the 'advanced' Spanish language packs (Level 4&amp;5), but found myself bored by the flashcard style of teaching and unable to retain what I was 'learning.' And so I trudged my way through Level 4 but gave up and never bothered with Level 5. This was several months ago.


Recently, I stumbled across the /int/ board on 4chan, and read my way through their ""Official How-to-Learn-a-Language-Guide."" It was here that I was introduced to the Michel Thomas Method, and I haven't looked back since. I downloaded Spanish Advanced, blew threw it in a weekend, and have never felt more comfortable with my conversational Spanish. Since then I have worked my way through the French Foundation course, am currently in the middle of the French Advanced course, and plan on beginning the German course shortly.


There are many shortcomings to the MTM, don't get me wrong. His Polish accent is downright frustrating to listen to, and his students are a few degrees above room temperature IQ. That being said, Michel's method of language teaching is unparalleled. As a student of over 10 languages, he is able to make connections that most teachers don't even know exist. There is no rote memorization, but rather an ability to understand the origins and dynamics of the language. In short, Michel makes learning a foreign language feel natural.

If I could recommend one thing to any prospective language leaner out there it would be this: before you do *anything*, devote 6 hours to the Michel Thomas Foundation method of your target language. The time you invest in learning with Michel is invaluable. No matter what program you choose to use afterwards, you will see Michel's lessons popping up everywhere, and be able to make connections that would otherwise be nonexistent. Good luck everyone!

I post this because I'm interested in  what other language learners think. I am genuinely shy about this and advice from friends to just go and speak just clams me up more.

I have been reading a Russian novel.  It is way above my comprehension level.  I have tried just brute-force reading without caring about comprehension.  I got about 10 chapters in.  This was interesting because it helped me see patterns that I never would have seen otherwise, but it was a drag because I want to understand the story.

In the past, I have tried (with this same novel) to look up every single word I don't know and put it in a flashcard program.  This allowed me to have nearly full comprehension of what I was reading, but the reading was laboriously slow and I got bored with it.

I have also recently realized that putting whole sentences into my flashcard program is immensely better than single words.  I have realized that when I do this, it coerces me into actually studying more of what I'm reading and it seems to activate much more of my brain in the process.


Recently, I decided to try and combine these techniques.  So, I am taking an adult-level novel that I have full text access to.  I am picking out every other sentence and using Google translate to give a good enough approximation of what it says.  I am putting that sentence into my flashcard program.  Then, I am studying those flashcards.  Finally, I am reading the actual text.

This technique seems to give me a very good balance between spoon-feeding words, phrases, and sentences and making me work for intuiting what I am reading.  Given that every other sentence is familiar to me, it seems to keep my mind from wandering so I stay more focused on trying to understand the new sentences.  It also allows me to follow the story even though I don't know everything I am reading.",,False,self,t5_2rjsc,False,,,True,t3_1aai2r,http://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/1aai2r/trying_something_new_learn_every_other_sentence/,

* Many people also consider **Italian** a beautiful language, with its clear vowel/consonant/vowel patterns, its double consonants, probably also the word stresses falling on the penultimate or antepenultimate syllable make the general music of it less boring. I personally find it very limited in terms of vowels, the fact that words never end with consonants also limit a lot the possible rhymes. I was never attracted to this language and I just know it because I work there
* I like **Russian** and **Romanian** very much, I like how the vowels can be more or less open, I like that weird î/â sound. Where italian jumps around in your mouth kicking the same three vowels, Russian and Romanian dance in your mouth. I like the ""ts"" sounds. I like the Russian ""L"". And ""oosh"".
* **English**. Come on, most words are one syllable long, very few more than three, and it makes it the most powerful weapon for singing. The language of rock'n'roll could have NEVER been French... Also I like how the intonation of the whole sentence matters as much as the words themselves, how you can tell what type of question is asked just by the tone of it.
* Many French people hate **German** and will be very happy to shout at you using the same three words that everybody knows from war movies (""schnell"", ""nein"" and ""achtung"") with their harshest accent, as a proof of the uglyness and aggressivity of German. I really disagree, I find it very fluid, I like how the ""s"" ""sh"" ""ch"" sound and make the sentences very consistent.
* I prefer **Spanish** to Italian, a little more variety, but the Castillan accent has some unpleasant features to me (""z/c"" and a very harsh ""j""). I find the global music of Castillan less pleasant than German.

Hey guys. Some time ago I posted the first version of my language learning plugin, Flewent, here. It was fairly well received. I got plenty of feedback, and several people wanted a dictionary feature. I finally got around to implementing that, and I've been happy with the results. 

Now you can build a dictionary to really focus on the words you're trying to pick up. You can let the dictionary grow to translate a bunch of random words, or you can actively maintain it and learn as you update it to contain only the words you want. 

The free translation service I use isn't perfect by any means (sometimes its hilariously bad) but with your own dictionary you can easily fix any errors you notice and learn as you go. I know there are several similar plugins, but I hope you'll find mine useful.

Apologies in advance if you consider this spammy. I make no money from this, its just something I've worked hard on and want to share with the world. 

If you're curious, in the future I plan to integrate a part of speech database into the dictionary, to enable actions like ""remove everything except nouns."" I would also like to add a service for sharing dictionaries among users, so that everyone can benefit from improvements and so that groups (like a class), can easily share the vocabulary they're focused on at a particular time. Please let me know if you have any feedback or recommendations.

You can try the plugin [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/flewent/kboplipnhaapngnahmdgminfepnokjhh), and if you want more information on using it, I wrote a usage guide [here](http://groff.co/flewent-usage-guide/).",,False,self,t5_2rjsc,False,,,True,t3_19tc5g,http://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/19tc5g/i_have_updated_flewent_my_language_learning/,

The university I am studying at here has given me less modules than expected, so I have suddenly been granted the gift of time.

So far I have spent that gift playing Counter-Strike and sleeping through most days. But I have decided to learn French. I am surrounded by polygots (mostly from Sweden and Norway) and I want to join them.

So today is the start of my attempt to learn French. In fact I have a deadline, which is the 21st of June. This was the challenge by my polygot Granddad, when I told him my interest by email.

Additionally, I am going to try to learn it for free. That's exactly £0 (or $0 for the Americans). 

My resources include -

- The Coffeeshop French podcast lessons.
- The Dualingo, SpkEasyFr, TripLingo, MosaFrench and Frenchlite iPhone apps.
- Memrise.com
- A book called 'Le francais de tous les jours' that my family gave me last time I saw them in the UK. I think the title means 'Everyday French'. It seems to lack any English translations, so I suppose I will have to guess what the words mean.
- Some hot French girl I know who also lives in Singapore.
- I have changed the language on Facebook to French. Although all I have learned from this is that 'status' becomes 'statut'.
- Anything else I can find for free on the internet.

So I was wondering if anyone would be interested if I put weekly updates on my progress or something like that. To keep themselves motivated etc.

If not, then I won't bother. Or maybe this belongs in another subreddit.

~ how-to-learn-any-language.com is, according to me anyway, the best language learning community on the internet today. Many respected, and even somewhat famous, language learners have participated there over the years. Unthinkable collective time and effort went into amassing everything that the website has to offer. All for the benefit of fellow language learners, written and organized free of charge. 

~ The website owner, however, applies draconian rules which **severely limit the accessibility of this freely contributed information** (unless you pay up, which I'm sure many cannot afford)

~ To add insult to injury, it is stated over and over how **everything submitted to the website becomes the owner's intellectual property**. 

~ When I submitted a lengthy open letter, in the hopes that the community at large might request reform, or at least discuss this pressing issue, the thread was DELETED without notice within 10 minutes. Upon contacting the moderators, not one was willing to say which forum rule the post broke to deserve removal (because it didn't break any BTW). 

I know some of you might think this is a petty issue and I'm crazy for even wasting my time. But I take that a few people here on Reddit, like me, can appreciate the importance of the freedom of information on the internet. 

And sure you can say, if you don't like it leave... but we are talking about the biggest and most respected collective of knowledge about language learning available. A collective like that cannot just be moved next door. 

It is as if the owner of Wikipedia called everything on Wiki his private intellectual property and started charging $40 a year for people to search it... sorry kids in the undeveloped countries.  

I'm asking anyone who actually cares, what can we do to peacefully convince HTLAL to change its ways and allow for freedom of information. And please no aggressive plans (hacking and such is out of question). 

Below (if you are still interested) are the original message I posted, the one that got deleted, as well as the message to the moderators - which was for the most part ignored.

While you're reading you can tap a word and get a pop-up definition or translation (currently supporting Swedish, French, German, Spanish, and Arabic). The context-sensitivity of the definitions is what separates this from automated definition translation technologies, in that this is actually accurate. The reason it's called Flikkt is because while reading in the app you can save words you're trying to learn to your personal dictionary (called a Flikktionary) by flicking them downwards. Here, you can review them and use them in word games etc.  

We have a similar web-based service through our website where you can read on your desktop/laptop. Currently, the front-page of the website shows how the thing works, here you hover with your mouse instead of tap with your to get the definition/translation.  

We have released a few books for English language-learners, and are working on more!

Rosetta Stone offers this free service of speaking and playing games with native speakers of your target language.

I'm assuming the service is free because most of their market is in the US. Part of their package includes being able to speak with native speakers so they've opened it up to everyone.

The downside is that there are still not a lot of users (I'm going to re-post in a couple of more language learning subreddits because I think many can profit from this tool). I'm using Spanish - there's usually always an opportunity to find a native speaker learning English.

The way the games work is that you do the first 4-6min session (or for however long you want to chat) in one language, then the other one in Spanish or the target language.

The site recommends you be at conversation level and won't let you check ""beginner"" for you language level (I'm guessing this is so they can get you to buy their product and learn) but as long as you're comfortable holding a simple conversation or talk about a simple topic prompted by the program, you will be fine.

Also, you can speak with other users learning your target language.

I'd like to share a method to get better once you've already learnt quite a bit of your target language. You need at least to be loosely conversational, and a mild interest for video games will help. 
It's nothing supernatural, but it was a decisive step in turning my then completely broken english into something decent and while I'm sure many people have done it, I believe it could be of use to a lot of people here. 
It's basically watching commented video games playthroughs on youtube and elsewhere, the amount of content there is enormous, easy to find, it's completely free and some of these are real comedy gold. Also, without noticing, watching an entire playthrough will get you dozens of hours of practice. You'll also notice that some commentators are very easy to understand while others will give you a hard time, so you can modulate the difficulty (it's no use if you can't get a word of what they say). For example, one commentator, Crendor, speaks an easy, slow american english while Jesse Cox has a midwest accent and always make voices which is one step harder. I personally rank the british accents of Totalbiscuit and the yogcast among the most difficult, but it's a matter of getting used to it.  
Some of my favourites are:  
- [Terraria](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89fW4MTJvRs&amp;list=PL56B73C4D478D9A49&amp;index=1&amp;feature=plpp_video) (Totalbiscuit and Jesse Cox)  
- [Lord of the rings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDNqQJ31lRQ&amp;list=ELZe9J9s5doR0&amp;index=1&amp;feature=plpp_video) (Jesse Cox, Trish and Crendor)  
- [Saint's row the third](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpnymdhSCjw&amp;list=SPF338C10D76C95321&amp;index=1&amp;feature=plpp_video) (Jesse Cox and Crendor)  
- [Magicka](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZHhwUK8aj8&amp;list=PL645A94C4720C11E7&amp;index=1&amp;feature=plpp_video) (Totalbiscuit and the Yogcast)  
- [Deus Ex] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOmoWVbhWiU&amp;list=ELUj2BdffTqow&amp;index=1&amp;feature=plpp_video) (Jesse Cox)  

I could add a few in french if you think this is of some interest. :) Also, does anyone know if some similar stuff is to be found in mandarin chinese? I'm currently at the same stage I was in english before watching these (and many others). 

edit: I don't know the french-speaking commentators as well as the english-speaking ones, but here are some.  
- [VSK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTHNdsAyLZw&amp;feature=BFa&amp;list=PL04FCBFCBA298D9BF) is a belgian commentator who did a ton of different games. (yeah, I like saint's row)  
- [Hooper](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ekpby89ffHs) - he speaks very, very slowly with a southern accent. Great for starters.  
- [Joueur du grenier](http://www.youtube.com/user/joueurdugrenier) only does ""tests"" of old games, and only the worst ones. No playthroughs/walkthroughs. Much like the AVGN. He's also the most famous I think.  

There are many more to find though. It seems the 'big' french commentators aren't yet decided to play in co-op (which is a pity, it's funnier) but I definitely remember watching others who did.

She, having studied this in school, sent me an email detailing how to approach learning a language. Here is what she had to say.
&gt;Some more on language learning.

&gt;1. Motivation: find some good motivation.  The greater the importance, the more likely you will be to stick to learning the language.  Like I said before, especially as an adult, it's time consuming.  Also, if you are motivated, you will enjoy it more, and learn faster.

&gt;2. Emotion: Language learning is one of the most emotional things to learn because it directly challenges our own identity and our ability to communicate with others.  People who won't try new things out of fear, quit easily, or have negative feelings toward the language they are trying to learn won't quickly.

&gt;3. Ambiguity: This also includes tolerance of ambiguity.  When we listen to foreign languages, we get tired quickly of trying to analyze patterns we can't understand. People with low tolerance for this situation of confusion will shut down quickly and refuse to listen; people with high tolerance will continue to listen and attempt to draw patterns or recognition out of the flow of unknown language.  This has a little to do with linguistic intelligence but largely with trust, self-assurance and patience.

&gt;3. Pre-immersion:  Before learning a language, spend time immersing yourself in the sounds of the language.  This means listening to it without trying to understand it.  Watch movies with English subtitles, commercials, whatever.  Listen to music.  This will help to raise your tolerance for ambiguity and make the language feel less foreign and threatening. If you can get a TV series that will hook you, all the better.

&gt;4. Make connections: usually we learn a language to connect with a new group of people.  Try doing that before or while you're learning a language.  There are lots of sites you can get a pen pal or Skype friend if you can't find a language exchange partner.  If you have a social and developing emotional connection to the language, it will help motivate you to keep going.

&gt;5. Get a good teacher.

&gt;6. Practice.  Use the internet, make flashcards, get a language exchange partner.

&gt;7. If you can, make time to immerse yourself totally in the language (preferably through travel) when you are comfortable, the earlier the better.  This is great, especially as an adult, where repetition is high and the stimulation is constant.

&gt;8. i + 1 rule.  This is pretty straightforward.  i is the body of knowledge you already understand, + 1 is the next most logical and convenient step to expanding that knowledge.  i + 1 is a concept for English teachers to pace their students by adding one new element at a time.  For learners, it can be restated as ""know what you know, figure out what you need to learn, and take it slowly.

[Essential Tagalog Grammar](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9081513516/ref=s9_psimh_gw_p14_d0_i5?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=center-2&amp;pf_rd_r=1HKY459ENWE9FMYPDHS2&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=1389517282&amp;pf_rd_i=507846) - A good grammar overview of Tagalog and quite comprehensive. Used as a reference, you can either read it cover-to-cover, or any part of the book which interests you.

[Complete Filipino](http://www.amazon.com/Complete-Filipino-Tagalog-Yourself-Language/dp/0071756590/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1365299203&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=teach+yourself+filipino) - A good beginners guide to Tagalog, complete with 2 CD's and workbook, and uses native speakers.

[Basic Tagalog for Foreigners](http://www.amazon.com/Tagalog-Foreigners-Non-Tagalogs-Language-Library/dp/0804838372/ref=pd_sim_b_2) - Another Teach Yourself-type book (but from a different company) useful to learn from a different perspective.

Now for the more advanced books which are also quite useful in my opinion.

[Conversational Tagalog](http://www.amazon.com/Conversational-Tagalog-A-Functional-Situational-Approach/dp/0824809440/ref=pd_sim_sbs_b_15) - An in-depth guide to using the language. Probably aimed at a teacher to prepare his or her lesson, but still, really good.

[Modern Tagalog](http://www.amazon.com/Ramos-Modern-Tagalog-Teresita-V/dp/0824813324/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_y) - This is for more advanced users of Tagalog. Shows grammar in a lot more detail.

[Intermediate Tagalog](http://www.amazon.com/Intermediate-Tagalog-Developing-Cultural-Awareness/dp/0824807766/ref=pd_sim_b_3) - A really good book for what it says, studying at an intermediate level.

Some other things you can do:

1. Listen to Filipino radio - When you first start to listen to the language, go in listening not to understand anything, but to get an idea of the sounds of the language. Keep in mind, you may hear a lot of slang/shortened terms - but this is all part of the fun! Then later start to listen for only key words, then learn more vocab, and start to try and figure out sentences.

2. Talk to Filipino friends after you have some of the basics, and when you do this, go in and expect to make mistakes, and question them about using words properly and grammar properly. I think it is better to make a lot of mistakes to see where you can improve. From personal experience, the filipino people I have practised to when I was learning the language were always happy to help, as well as appreciative.

3. When talking, start to use some taglish (english and tagalog sentences); that is, say to them, ""Do you want pupunta sa shopping mall ngayon gabi kasama ni kami?""

4. Go to the philippines (even for three weeks if you dont want to go for long)- although most people speak english there, they also speak tagalog, so you can really put what you learnt into action, and its more rewarding personally. This will be one of the ultimate tests of using the language (you will also impress the locals quite a lot, and they don't care if you make some mistakes, they will most likely laugh it off and correct you.)

5. Watch as much filipino media you can (movies, TV shows etc.)

6. Read online tagalog news sites if you want (such as GMA News)
Although GMA news is mainly in English, they have the [Filipino Report](http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/ulatfilipino) which has a lot of daily articles in Tagalog.

I actually learned this years ago as a way of improving my presentation skills in English, but realized recently it works here as well. The idea is simple: slow down. When I first learned the tip it was to get rid of words like ""um, yeah, so"", and other things that don't sound very elegant when speaking. If you speak slower and naturally insert pauses periodically (they'll feel much longer to you than they actually are), then your mouth ends up moving at the same speed or even slower than your brain, which means it's never searching for stuff to say or getting ahead of itself.

I think this can help when speaking in your target language. One of the biggest difficulties, I've found is that if I just try to speak, I'll often find myself backed into a corner. Because of how German grammar works, I can put the subject after the verb. This means that sometimes, I'll find myself in a situation where I don't know enough German to finish the sentence I started given the verb I have chosen. So I either say something wrong and awkward sounding, start the sentence over, or confuse whoever I am speaking with. I might want to say something like

&gt;""Also, the children have a lot of patience"". (because they behaved well, for example)

But I don't see the whole thing at once, so my mind just spits out the following words:

&gt;Auch haben die Kinder...

But then, say, I don't really know a good word for patience. I might know a ton of adjectives, but can't make them into nouns on the fly. Or I might know another expression (anständig sich benehmen). Anyway, I noticed if I just slow down and think a little I can start the sentence in a way that doesn't get me stuck in any corners. I think that writing is actually one way we force ourselves to do this, which perhaps is one big advantage to practicing that skill too.

[readlang.com](http://readlang.com)

It lets you import any plain text to read, either imported from other websites, via copy and paste or file upload. (Personally I like to use [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/) to generate plain text versions of novels and import them, but the importer bookmarklet is the quickest way.)

While reading, you can click on any word, or groups of words, to translate them with google translate.

After reading, it remembers the words you translated and lets you practice them with flashcards, which contain the original context of the translated word. It uses a SRS algorithm similar to Anki. Actually, it supports exporting the flashcards to use in Anki if you prefer.

The site is early in development but definitely usable and will be free forever to anyone signing up now, as thanks for being a beta tester and providing feedback.

Hope you like it!

I think Club Penguin only has 4 or 5 languages, though, so it may be difficult to find your language. Just a tip.

Native speakers of X needed!",bromega,33,4,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/okqxx/connectors_a_springboard_for_fluency_native/,"The following Czech-English connectors derived from http://www.anthonylauder.com/ , better known on YouTube as FluentCzech, are really quite ingenious.  When first learning a language, we are essentially constrained to very artificial, stumbling ways of connecting even our very few ideas.  With these 'connectors' we can essentially give language learners a huge boost in fluency and ability to communicate by filling in all those 'missing links' between what we'd like to say, and give our flowering language more character beyond and's and but's.  

My request is that native speakers of any language submit a list similar to this, one that allows a fledgling speaker a vast array of tools that can help mitigate a lack of vocabulary or shyness.  When i used a list (source sadly lost) of German connectors, my german communicative abilities skyrocketed and i wouldn't know where i'd be without such phrases as ""um ehrlich zu sein...""  ""in der Tat..""

unfortunately his list is too long to copy pasta, so here's a few excerpts;

""

When you are asked a question, it can put you on the spot. Your mind can go blank, and soon you don't know how to even start answering.

Opening connectors are really useful for getting the first few words out of your mouth (“breaking the silence”) while you settle down to give the real answer to the question.

Imagine you are asked where you are from, and your brain is racing to first fully comprehend the question and second to come up with an answer.

You can get some breathing space by starting out with:

“To je dobrá otázka ...” then once the momentum is going your brain relaxes and it is much easier to keep going and say “… (I am from England) jsem z Anglie”
Filler Connectors

Filler connectors are throw-away phrases you can insert when you need a little more thinking time.

They give the illusion of deep pondering, or sharing something personal, which is exactly what you want while you think of what you are going to say next:

understandably
	

pochopitelně

frankly speaking
	

upřímě řečeno

between you and me
	

mezi námi řečeno

anyway
	

nicméně

well then
	

nuže tedy

well, as a matter of fact
	

no, ve skutečnosti

how can I put it?
	

jak bych to řekl?

I must say that
	

musím říct, že

firstly
	

za prvé

secondly
	

za druhé

I would like you to know that
	

rád bych, abyste věděl, že

I am afraid that
	

obávám se, že

now and then it seems to me that
	

chvilemi se mi zdá, že

after all
	

přece jenom

as far as I am concerned
	

co se mě týče

more and more
	

čím dál víc

actually
	

vlastně

all joking aside
	

konec srandy

now seriously
	

teď vážně

As an example, somebody asks:

“(Where) Kde (do you live) bydlíte?”

If your brain panics, or you feel that just saying a place name is too abrupt, you can throw some filler in there before the answer:

“(Between you and me) Mezi námi řečeno (I live in Prague) bydlím v Praze”
Apologising Connectors

When you make a mistake, or feel embarrassed, or you are about to put somebody in a slightly uncomfortable situation, it is all too easy to blush, panic, and revert to your own language.

Instead, if you have rehearsed the Apologising Connectors until they become part of you, you will soon find that your automatic reaction to embarrassment is to use one of them to defuse the tension.

They will get you over the embarrassment hurdle so you can carry on.

don't be upset, but
	

nezlobte se, ale

it was a slip of the tongue
	

to mi uklouzlo

I said it by mistake
	

řekl jsem to omylem

I am sorry that
	

omlouvám se, že
Qualifying Connectors

Czechs tend to not be overly impressed with show-offs, so a bit of humility gets you a long way.

To soften a statement, instead of just saying something as if it is a fact, it can help to wrap it up with a qualifying connector.

There are loads of these, and you need to keep varying them throughout a conversation so you don’t sound like a robot stuck on replay.

to tell the truth
	

abych pravdu řekl

I presume that
	

já se domnívám, že

I hope that
	

doufám že

in my opinion
	

podle mého názoru

if that is true
	

jestli je to pravda

I don't know exactly
	

já nevím přesně

I would like to think that
	

chtěl bych myslet že

the way I see it is that
	

vidím to tak, že

as you may know
	

jak asi víte

I don't have a big interest in that
	

nemám velký zájem o to

if I understand correctly
	

rozumím-li dobře

as you already know
	

jak už víte

that isn't such a big problem

-Are you doing it for travel purposes? What, specifically?

-Because you want to expatriate/move to another country? 

-You want to be able to speak your significant other's language? Or you want to be able to talk to their in-laws whose English isn't as good as your gf/bf's is?

-An academic exercise, as in you just enjoy the challenge and mental stimulation (a surprisingly large number of people fall into this category, you'll see a lot of them over at the [HTLAL forums](http://how-to-learn-any-language.com/forum/default.asp) )

-Is it required for work/business?

-You're studying in or, more likely, majoring in a language in school?

I'm curious about some approximate time frames for language acquisition, specifically in Mandarin.

I'm a native English speaker and currently learning Spanish for the rest of this year. I'm hoping to ultimately achieve a B2/C1 level over the next 8 months, so I'm not a complete rookie when it comes to language learning but I'm far from an experienced learner!

Next year, I am contemplating moving to China to learn Mandarin. I've read a bit about it and am getting very varied time frames for going from essentially nothing to a conversational level and fluency.

If living in the country, studying and attempting to refrain from speaking English, what are some realistic timeframes to achieve such goals?

* 3 - 6 months to achieve conversational mandarin? (A2?)
* 9 - 12 months to feel comfortable speaking only mandarin and a grasp of written mandarin? (B1/B2?)
* 3+ years to gain fluency (C1?)

Any information is appreciated.

Do you take notes/have a dictionary beside you?

* **It is John’s apple**.
* **I give John the apple**.
* **We give him the apple**.
* **He gives it to John**.
* **She gives it to him**.

By translating these sentences you can answer these questions:

1. Are there new grammatical structures that will postpone fluency? (look at SOV vs. SVO, as well as noun cases)

2. Are there new sounds that will double or quadruple time to fluency? (especially vowels)

3. How similar is it to languages I already understand? What will help and what will interfere? (Will acquisition erase a previous language? Can I borrow structures without fatal interference like Portuguese after Spanish?)

4. All of which answer: How difficult will it be, and how long would it take to become functionally fluent?

There are two extra sentences to see if auxiliary verbs exist (e.g. Spanish, English), or if the end of each verb changes (e.g. Japanese).

* **I must give it to him.**
* **I want to give it to her.**

That being said, let me give some information about me, my studies, etc., so that hopefully I can get some detailed response &amp; opinion.


-I'll be entering college next year, where I'll be afforded the opportunity to spend my junior year abroad intensely studying whichever language I choose to study.

-Reasons for me wanting to learn these languages include research (undergraduate &amp; graduate), reading (i.e. literature), love of foreign culture, and desire to expand myself

-I've worked through Tae Kim's *Remember the Kanji* and have learned the writing of the jōyō kanji, which seems to have applicability with regards to hanzi as well. 


Now, I suppose I'll mention some of my brief musings about each language.

With regards to Mandarin, one thing that immediately comes to mind is the growing economic power of China, as well as its size, make Mandarin an increasingly appealing language. It's also a country with a marvelously rich history and culture. The college which I'll be attending also offers a course in Classical Chinese for advanced students, which is very alluring as I'm very interested in works in classical languages. It offers no such equivalent for bungo/literary Japanese.

Japan, however, I find almost equally appealing, as far as its culture and language go. I have a noted head start in this too, as I already know the katakana and hiragana scripts, and, as previously mentioned, the writings of the common-use Kanji. I have exposed myself much more to Japanese culture through reading and research, so I'm more familiar with it than that of China. I also watch quite a deal of anime, which is by no extent of the imagination my impetus for learning, but still notable I suppose. At least from what I've seen, Japan has more of a wealth of media which can be consumed for learning purposes.


Whichever I choose, I will be dedicating a great deal of time to. I'm hoping to be able to reach at least a C1, if not a C2, by my return from abroad. Thanks for taking the time to read all of this, and sorry if anything was rambly.

I hope you'll forgive the probable repost as I wanted to pose the question in a slightly different way and get your personal take on it.

I've recently embarked on a bit of an insane task to learn many (many) languages and had something probably quite familiar in these parts niggling away at me. I've settled it for myself but I was curious as to others' reasons and thoughts.

In an age where English is spoken by many (though certainly not all), where translation tools are growing quicker and more knowledgeable, and technology (e.g. Project Glass) is promising to provide near-instantaneous translations in the near future for some/many languages, why did you start picking up a language?

Were you aware of the feeling among some that learning a second language is, or soon will be, redundant and went ahead anyway?

If technology delivered on its promise of translation on the go (even more than it can at the moment), would it change your mind about language learning?

Thanks everyone.

P.S. I'm writing a blog post about my reasons for learning, which sparked this question. I'm not sure if links to personal blogs are okay here, but if they are, I'll stick it up when I'm done.

Then I realised how incredibly useful that was. I didn't need to know in English what a word meant at all, in fact I could get a very good overview of the shades of meaning it had by doing a Google image search on the word itself.

The greatest challenge so far has been the problem of switching from one language to another. I live in Germany with my Czech girlfriend, and I study a master's programme in mathematics that is held in English. Because of that, I have to constantly switch between Czech (when I speak to my girlfriend), English (which I use with my classmates), German (with my German friends), and also Russian (which I practice with my classmates coming from Russia).

Switching between the languages has been very challenging to me. Sometimes, a form of indecisiveness is the culprit (for example, a few days ago I said ""is it jetzt frei?"" to a girl in a school canteen referring to the place she had just left, because I could not decide fast enough what language I should be using). Sometimes, I cannot find the right words, because all the appropriate words I can think of are in a different language. Even worse, I sometimes feel that I 'physically' cannot switch to the required language; for about 10 seconds, I feel as if I didn't speak the language at all, being unable to say a single word in that language.

My question therefore is: did you (or do you) have similar problems with switching between different languages? Have you been able to overcome these problems?

    * ""10,000 to 2,000,000"" - thats a rather broad estimate for the number of speakers
    *  Although no country has adopted it officially
    * Esperanto has never been a secondary official language of any recognized country.
 

Otherwise:


    * It is regarded as the easiest and least time consuming language to learn.
    * It has the potential to be useful around the world.... but I really wonder if I should use the 'projected 150 learning hours' on it.

I've always had a passion for language learning and I couldn't decide which language to learn next. For some reason, I was never interested in Spanish while growing up. I never took any Spanish classes and I didn't care much about the music or their culture in general. I even considered Spanish to be like a ""third-world"" language.

As many of you may know, the most important thing to learn a language successfully is to have passion. Passion not only for the language and the culture, but also for the people and the history. Anyhow, I decided to give Spanish a try a few weeks ago and I'm beginning to like it a lot. I've lit a spark that keeps growing inside of me. It is a beautiful language that is so easy to learn (at least for someone with my language background). I can't believe that I've waited so long. I'm getting really addicted. The progress that I make each week is mind-boggling hehe. It also keeps me motivated knowing that I'll probably be quadrilingual this year!

If you are in a similar situation, give Spanish a try, you won't regret it.

* Red Dead Redemption (text only)
* Bioshock 1 &amp; 2
* Gears of War 1 &amp; 2
* The Orange Box
* Portal 2
* some text on Mass Effect, but it was a little buggy

So I guess it's safe to say this is the case with Rockstar (text only), Epic, 2K, and Valve games. I only tried German for most of them, but with Portal 2 went through all and got Spanish, Russian, and French to work IIRC.

When I asked teachers about this (i.e. about correcting students), most of them answered that some students don't want to be corrected, especially not in front of the class.

Now this doesn't mean that I want to humliate people in front of their friends. I acknowledge the fact that some students might not have much self confidence and feel shy. That's okay. But is this a reason to not correct something they're doing seriously wrong? No! Teachers should correct students, that's our job. Sure, we can do it politely, individually and in a discreet manner, but we have to do it.

I have primarily used these programs for language learning. I have had ups and downs, and I have tried many uses of these programs that have helped me and many that have not.

Recently, I had an epiphany that helped me increase my daily review count by a factor of 5. I thought I would share what I realized and what I am doing in case it helps someone else.

First, let me describe what I have expected out of SRS programs and the problems that I have encountered. Then, I will describe the epiphany I had and how this changed my habits.

**What I expected, what I got**

All [SRS (Spaced-Repitition Software) programs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) are based on the [forgetting curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve) that was hypothesized by [Hermann Ebbinghaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Ebbinghaus). The gist of this as I have understood it is that when you learn something, you will forget it after a period of time. This time is initially very small, perhaps seconds, minutes, or hours. The next time you learn the same item, the time grows longer. This amplifies each time you relearn the same thing until theoretically, you will remember the bit of information for your entire life.

So, the purpose of Anki or other SRS is to show a flashcard to you repeatedly until you can recall it once. After that, it won't show it to you again for a longer and longer delay each time you recall it correctly. The idea is to make your study time efficient by having you focus on cards you are either struggling with or about to forget but not focusing on cards that you should remember easily. The way that I have read about how to use an SRS and the way I have primarily used an SRS is to come back to the program each day, go through all the cards I have due, and then add as many new cards as I can with the time I want to devote to it.

Whenever I start a new deck (and I have started many, many decks), this is nifty and exciting. I crank through a bunch of new cards and keep cranking through new cards, and it feels great. Then, after a few days the due cards start coming in. At first, I just switch my daily habits and deal with all the due cards and then fill in some more time adding new cards. Then, the number of due cards starts going up and up. Then, I skip a few days for whatever reason, and I suddenly have a huge pile of due cards, and, because I am following the recommended practices, I feel like I have to handle all of the due cards before I can add any new ones. This is a pain in the ass. For any deck I have ever created or downloaded, the eventual fate of that deck is that I abandon it because I get too far behind.

In addition to backlog glut, I have also noticed over two other problems that de-motivate me and make me want to abandon a given deck. One problem is pattern recognition versus learning. I have noticed that when I am churning away through my due cards, if I run into any difficulty in processing what the words actually mean, then my mind automatically goes into a mode where I just look for a pattern of that word, phrase or sentence, and I ""guess"". The problem with this is that what ends up happening is that, given a long enough time, I end up seeing this same card over and over and over and over again without ever actually learning it. The other problem is that I seem to spend an inordinate amount of time on cards that I am having a lot of difficulty with. This gets to the point where it dominates the time I spend with a deck. This is boring and demotivating.

**My epiphany, what I changed**

Recently a couple of things triggered for me at the same time. The first thing that happened was that I was close to the point where I wanted to abandon multiple decks at the same time. I realized this and wanted to try and avoid it. I took a mental step back and realized that what I really love about studying flashcards is the process of seeing new flashcards. I like the process of seeing a new phrase or sentence, seeing what the translation is and then just thinking about it for a few seconds. What I really love is when I see a brand-spanking-new flashcard and I look at it, and I know it. That is awesome. That is the whole point of all of my studies, so it is very rewarding to me when that happens. So, I started taking a break from reviewing any old cards. I basically said, ""screw it! I'm just going to abandon them anyway,"" so I figured I may as well at least get some happiness out of reviewing more new cards. I found that this was quite enjoyable.

The second thing that happened is that I encountered a new blurb about Ebbinghaus. I think it was here on reddit, but I don't recall where I saw it, so I apologize for not linking to it. The tidbit was a description of what Ebbinghaus did that he based his conclusions on. What I read was that he picked list upon list of nonsense syllables. He would memorize a given list and time himself for how long it took to remember that. He would then come back to that list later and see if he remembered it or not. If he did not, then he would learn it again and time himself. What he found was that after he learned a given list, two things were true. First, he would be able to recall it for longer and longer periods of time. Second, after he forgot it, it would take less and less time to learn it again.

This second thing is what struck me. It seems so obvious, but I was overlooking that facet in my studies. If I forget something that I learned, it will take me less and less time to relearn it. Wow! When I was getting piles upon piles of due cards in Anki (or Flashcards Deluxe or SuperMemo), I had this sinking feeling that I was losing those cards and I would have to start over with learning them if I didn't get on it and get them reviewed. Now, I realize that no matter how long those sit there, when I do eventually get back to them, it will take me less time to relearn them when I try again.

It also dawned on me that if I let enough time go by, then I can treat due cards as if they are new, at least mentally. I don't have to act like I should have already known that. I can just act like I never knew it and then be happy if I do know it. So, I started switching gears every few days. I have been adjusting my Anki settings to 0 reviews and 500 new per day to 2000 reviews and 0 new per day and back again whenever I feel like (seems like every few days).

This has been ... awesome. I have been letting my due cards build up to 1000 or 1500, usually 4-5 days behind. When I start digging into them, they feel new, but for most of them, I just crank through them. After a couple of days when I whittle through most of them, I start to get down to where it is feeling boring, repetitious, and my mind starts seeking quick pattern recognition over actual understanding. When this happens, I turn off reviews and crank through a bunch of new cards for a few days.

The result of this switch is that on the deck that I am focusing on, I see that I was doing about ~500 reviews per week. In the past 3 weeks, my numbers are 1800, 2900, and 3500. I've been adding at least 1000 new cards per week. I used to add about 100 per week, but not every week. I've been using this deck for 20 weeks. It is a list of 24000 Russian sentences. I am now about 4000 cards in.

I have also noticed that when I sit down to study, it just feels different. I find that it has become an addicting game that I can't put down. Instead of feeling like it is a chore that I just need to buckle down and do, I rather find that when I have been studing for a bit, I think, ""I should put this down now ... but just one more.""

I'm a Canadian guy living in Finland and wish to push my Finnish to the next level. I have had beginner courses in the past so got the basics covered. I also have a decent, but not great, vocabulary from learning words here and there. This all sounds good and dandy but the reality is that I am stuck at this level. My Finnish is NOT practical, I can't really make myself understood except for basic stuff and I have trouble understanding when people speak to me.


Here's an example: in the classroom I can understand virtually everything the teacher says but as soon as I step outside, in real life, I can barely catch anything. I know that spoken/formal Finnish are very different, hence the gap, but I don't seem to be able to get over it at the moment.


Would anyone know good resources to improve my conversational skills and understanding? I know grammar is important but I would prefer to make a few mistakes and being able to make myself understood than knowing all the rules but not being able to apply any of them, if that makes any sense.


I would also be interested to meet with anyone willing to practice basic conversation. Either in Helsinki or Tampere. As a Canadian I know English and French, which I could teach in return. If you're interested please drop me a PM or something :)

Of course, you still need to know the basics of grammar and pronunciation before this method becomes a really useful tool.

I imagine in part due to my love of ancient history. I've finally decided that I wish to put the time and effort into learning it.


I have Rosetta Stone for Latin and I know how some of you feel about the program, but I got it for free because a friend of mine didn't want it. It's only level one of course, but even still. Also there's no Pimsleur for Latin, unless I'm woefully incompetent and can't find it.


I've researched different approaches for learning the language and originally found Wheelox, but I was dissuaded from this by a friend of mine who was studying to be a priest who said that the primary problem is that it teaches decoding of the language instead of actually learning it. Taking a class is out of the question, as there are none in the general vicinity of my house. I tried asking a priest I know who teaches a class on theology at a nearby college, and he said that he couldn't teach me Latin as his understanding is fairly basic and he says teaching a language would be significantly different from teaching a theology class, which I understand.


So, what would the fine people of this community suggest?

I'm trying to learn Spanish. I should be a lot better than I am because I have had roughly a year of one to one lessons for two hours per week (I don't do this anymore), I live in a Spanish speaking country and I have a Spanish speaking wife. I know that this situation is a dream for some people and I have heard of people gaining conversational fluency with less. 

However, I am just terrible at Spanish. I did get to a good level with the grammar and felt ready to just practice a lot but then I had to fly home for three and a half months and I didn't practice at all in that time so I forgot quite a lot. Now I am back in Costa Rica and I am feeling lost with Spanish. My grammar knowledge seems to be quite patchy and I can't seem to remember quite a lot of vocabulary that I used to know. 

I have never really spoken much. I met my wife in England when I knew no Spanish at all so we have always spoken English. She is good at it and it is difficult to actually speak Spanish with her. It's like a catch22, I have problems expressing what I am trying to say so our conversations are limited in Spanish so we inevitably switch back to English sooner or later, it's just natural for us to communicate in English. Sometimes I get the urge to finally get to grips and only ever speak Spanish with her but this only ever lasts a day or so. I don't have many friends here and I can get away with speaking very little on a day to day basis, which is not a good thing really. 

I am shy even in English so when it comes to Spanish I am pretty terrified. I just can't get past the feeling like an idiot part. I feel completely stupid speaking with my wife, I absolutely hate it. Apart from that though, it is just so much hard work trying to say what I want to say. 

I know the answer is just to do it but this is difficult. Now, with the holes in my grammar and my bad memory with vocab I feel like I'm at an all time low. I know I'm not, I can understand more now than I ever have been able to but in speaking I feel like a complete beginner and it is embarrassing considering I've been here for a year and a half. 

I also have some kind of a mental block which I think is to do with my shyness. When someone speaks to me I kind of panic and can't even formulate simple sentences. After these encounters I can think of how I should've replied quite easily but at the time my mouth and mind don't seem to work at all, let alone together. 

So where should I start? Is there any advice you can offer?

It seems like a big issue but I haven't come across much on the topic. 

Most language learning products present themselves as non-political, solely focusing on the language itself. I'd argue that the opposite is often the case. Without wanting to get too ranty, here's a couple of examples:  

* Many language textbooks that I've come across unquestionably promote a Western capitalist ideology, promoting Western brands and figures. ""Ethical issues"" may appear, but generally under the guise of a consumerist question such as *should I buy real fur coat or not?*

* Apart from the fact that the TEFL industry bears a strong resemblance to missionaries who travelled across the globe in the age of empire to spread their gospel, [there are still missionaries travelling across the globe to spread their gospel via English classes](http://www.reddit.com/r/TEFL/comments/1d6ic5/its_time_we_stop_ignoring_the_elephant_in_the_room/).

* I've taught language classes to many people who are learning a new language to escape their current circumstances, but this motivation has never been addressed in any language learning material I've seen. In fact, personal circumstances seem to be largely avoided, unless it involves buying things.

The language learning industry is huge, necessarily turning knowledge and skills into a commodity. I guess I'm interested in looking at it all a bit more critically for my own benefit both as someone learning and teaching languages.

About 7 months ago I asked for feedback on my vocabulary learning app that I wrote as a training exercise, and I wanted to share how it developed.

Adoption was slow but steady. About 100 people downloaded the app per week, and attrition was about half that. Right now the German version has 1350 active users. I put an ad in an unintrusive spot, and so far I've made about $15 from it, about $2 per month.

The inverse version (teaching German speakers English words) was a total failure, probably because the app is at a very basic level, and most Germans speak at least basic English.

I just released French and Spanish versions, but so far adoption has been slow.

So it certainly isn't a smashing success, but I wouldn't call it a total failure either. People use it daily and I get about 2,000 ad views daily (so that means users review at least that many words per day). But so far I've had one (1) person contact me directly with suggestions. I would have expected more user engagement.

Now I'm thinking whether I should abandon the project and move on to something more innovative, or if there are some fairly easy changes I could make to make it more engaging. If you have an Android phone and feel motivated to try it out, please do so! Make sure to check out the recently added Instagram mode (click the wrench icon in the top bar, and select ""Picture Source"" -&gt; Instagram)!

Some ideas I had:

* Add more words (duh)
* Add a phrase for each word to improve retention
* Add a phrase trainer, things like ""Thank you"" etc., with pronunciation practice
* Leverage crowd sourcing: Allow users to add their own words and pictures, with an option to upload them, and I will include them in future versions of the app, if they're helpful
* Make statistics more accessible and transparent
* Improve Instagram mode (keep track of which pictures were guessed correctly immediately, using them more often, and inversely avoid pictures that perform poorly; or have a thumbs up/down button)

Any other ideas?
I'll mostly likely start working on an iOS version later this year!

I've stumbled across this sub thanks to a video about a polyglot on the FP. 

From when I was 16 to about when I was 21, I loved to study languages in my spare time and try to speak them whenever I could. I am 24 now. My mother tongue is Korean, but English is my native tongue. I've studied Spanish, Italian, German in schools, and Polish by myself. 

As I'm growing older and busier, I'm having less and less time to even put to use most of these languages I've learned. I used to be very fluent in at least Spanish and Polish, and understand basic Italian and German. I can mainly understand those languages now when I see them or hear them, but to speak is becoming quite difficult. Also, not having my family speak Korean has had a toll on my understanding of my mother tongue. What is more is that most recently I've had some issues with health that has had some detrimental effects on my memory and caused my speech to be a bit stuck(?).

What I want to ask is, how can I not lose these that I've worked and during the time I've studied them, loved to learn? My lifestyle is becoming busier and busier with more and more responsibilities with work and family whilst back then, I had so much free time to study and even go abroad.

Especially with my mother tongue, Korean, this is something that I would hopefully like to pass on down the generations, but I am the first in my family to be married outside our nationality. What methods or tools are out there that can help me retain these?

Okay, so the title is pretty self explanatory. I want to learn Dutch, so I went to go check out UReddit and didn't find any courses. And after looking at the site, the language section is really lacking. I think it'd be really great if we could get some willing teachers to put up courses for their languages and help flesh out the Language section of UReddit. 

This thread is one where students can express interest in learning a particular language. (Prospective) Teachers can then glance through the thread, see if their native (or any of their fluent) languages have been requested. If they decide there's enough interest in their language to make a course (which is up to the individual teacher), then the teacher can comment and tell the students to expect a course. 

It'd be good if there was only one main comment per-language, and then other people who want to learn said language can comment as children. Just to make browsing easier. 

**Example: If you want to request French, check the thread to see if anyone else wants to lean French. If they do, great! Tack your comment onto theirs. If not, then feel free to post a comment to the main thread.**

Teachers can take a look at the available UReddit courses to get some ideas for formatting. 

I really hope you all like this idea, I think it would mutually benefit everyone. Students would have free learning materials from a native/fluent speaker, fluent speakers would get some experience teaching (not so useful if it's your native, but if it's a language you're pretty good at then it'll only help solidify what you've learned), and the UReddit community will have a bigger and better Language section!

Basically, with my current knowledge of Spanish I can communicate non-super-complicated ideas without hand gestures, though with some hesitation since I have to think about exact conjugations--the words come easy, but grammar not always. I can also have conversations, understand people when conversing with them, and have a full grasp of Spanish grammar, excluding subjunctive--I do have a lot of experience studying it, but putting it into practice is something I still have to get used to. My native language is English, so it's difficult.

Anyway, basically my biggest struggle at the moment is comprehension of spoken Spanish, like on TV/in movies. I can catch words and understand some parts, but other parts I'm completely and utterly lost to. If they speak slowly, like in kid's shows, I can understand much better, but still I'm faulty with it. So what can I do to increase this skill on my own? I personally think that watching TV/movies in the language you're studying is very helpful to learning, but how do I pass that wall of 'slightly able to understand' to 'mostly able to understand'?

Additionally, my vocabulary is good, especially when it comes to verbs, but it still needs improvement. Obviously this is the case with all intermediate speakers, but I have no idea what exactly to study or how to study it. Straight up memorization works for the short term, but it doesn't stick very well. Is there some standard form of practice for people at my level, or is it just acquired over time? I'm not in any hurry to learn to language, but it bothers me that I have to keep pausing midsentence because I don't know a word. And that happens *a lot*. It's very draining and makes it hard to practice for long periods of time before just dying to speak English!

For the record, I studied Spanish in Granada, Spain for 3 months and was in a class that was borderline B2 but also accommodated B1 students due to small class size (only 3 people at B2 level). I am now back in the US and have switched to learning latin american Spanish. Fortunately I didn't learn too much of the Castellano dialect, mostly I focused on studying the grammar.

The themes would be real-life situations where you would need to use that language, like purchasing items at a shop, talking to a friend, buying a train ticket, etc. This wouldn't be one of those conversational chatbots where the conversations can go anywhere. It would be guided in that, in your native language, you would be told how to respond, and you would then have to type the correct response in the language you're learning.

Example interaction: instructions in English, learning French.

------------

&gt;Instruction: **You see your friend. Say hello to him.**

&gt;Typed: ""bonjour""

&gt;Response from friend: ""Salut. Comment allez-vous?""

&gt;Instruction: **Tell him you're fine.**

&gt;Typed: ""Bien, merci""

&gt;Instruction: **Now tell him goodbye**

&gt;Typed: ""Au revoir""

&gt;Response from friend: ""Au revoir""

You would get your vocabulary beforehand, so you can first practice it with some flashcard method. Before you can proceed to the actual conversation you would have to pass a test of the individual words.


The conversations/interactions could be through a stale text chatbot application, or maybe some application that would show images based on what's happening in the conversations and also play recordings of what's being said, or they could be made into character conversations in some adventure/RPG game like these, too:

I am in a very lucky position that I get to share with my child 3 languages. Dutch, English and Spanish. I'm only 13 weeks pregnant now, but these are things I am already thinking about...

There is a small issue though. I don't like the Dutch teachings. I don't like my thought processes in Dutch and (sadly) since I hardly speak Dutch, I am starting to loose words. I am more fluent in English right now (it flows more easily and more naturally) than in Dutch.


I know that the main things we teach our children are unconscious. The way we talk to strangers, body language etc teaches them to be open or to be shy (besides their own nature of course).


To learn another language as your mother tongue you need to hear/speak it at least 33% of the time you are awake, according to the information I've found so far.

Spanish is easy; the entire family and my husband will speak Spanish + school + friends.

Dutch and English are not as easy.

There are 2 options;

Either I will speak Dutch to the child, or English. If I speak English, all the books, TV (like sesame street) and songs will be in Dutch as well as my parents talking on the phone or skype with the child once a week.

If I speak Dutch my fear is that I will unconsciously teach my child all kinds of crap stuff, like low self esteem, to be ""normal"" at all costs, and that others are more important than yourself.

If I speak English my fear is that my child will not grow up being fluent in Dutch, which I feel is important. They might be able to speak it, but will they be able to be fluent, without accent? (Important if they ever want to live in the Netherlands!!) And will they be able to speak easily with their grandparents, who don't speak English?

I am not worried about fluency in English because we plan to sent him/her to a bilingual school anyway, and there is enough exposure to English that that won't be a concern.


(We live in Mexico, I'm Dutch by birth, my husband is Mexican. I am relatively fluent in Spanish, just a few mistakes here and there, my husband and I both are fluent in English, and my husband understands basic Dutch)

**UPDATE:

Thank you all for answering. We have decided to go with me speaking Dutch and my husband Spanish. English is easy to pick up later on from the environment and bilingual schools (there are some very good ones here, where the normal subjects are simply given in Spanish or English besides specific language classes).**",,False,self,t5_2rjsc,1359396935.0,,,True,t3_179t1r,http://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/179t1r/languages_for_a_child/,

My question is, I know this is teaching formal sentence structure/grammar, but I can't help but think some of what duolingo teaches formally is stuff that doesn't get used casually. And it's really frustrating trying to translate the sentences when there are meanings doubled.

Another sentence that annoyed me was ""a mi padre no le importa el dinero"", which according to duolingo translates to ""my father does not care about money"" but I translated it to ""to my father, your money is not important"", which seems more accurate. Maybe it's just one of the translation glitches in the later levels of duolingo.

I haven't got any experience learning a language that is so different from my own but I may be going to Finland for one month, and while I am perfectly aware that people there can speak English, I wish to be able to speak a little bit of Finnish.

I have heard that written and spoken Finnish differ significantly.

A Finnish friend has taught me a little already and seemed quite impressed with how I was able to pick it up but unfortunately she isn't a great teacher and I can't really accept someone dedicating so much time to me anyway.

What are some good Finnish resources online that don't take up a lot of time? My time is unfortunately somewhat limited although my trip is around 9 months away, so I think I can make some progress even though I am aware it is an extremely difficult language.

For now I have been just copying down my friend's example sentences, trying to understand some grammar but just accepting it for now if it doesn't make too much sense. Is this a good way to go about a language with difficult grammar? What can I do to get the most out of my time spent on the language?

Thank you very much in advance.

Edit: forgot to clarify. I am not under the illusion that I am going to be fluent by then, possibly not even conversational. I just want to know some, and while I have done a search in this subreddit, I found an overwhelming amount of links.
