It's got me very excited.

It all looked great, but there were some key points that really stood out to me; the real-time lighting (when the ghost was navigating the room) was just awesome. The environments in general look beautiful, very refreshing. The way your friends join you? That's sweet too. But most of all, when they came across the Public Event, and joined it with other players... that just blew me away.

Now, I know it's a fairly simple concept, and some may be thinking ""What's the big deal?"", but I think this will be a great game dynamic. It hit me with a sense of nostalgia, thinking about how I met those I'm closest to on Xbox Live, in Halo 2/3 matchmaking. Imagine traversing the vast landscapes with your friends, in (what seemed to be) such a ""natural"" environment - for lack of a better term - then all of a sudden, *something* happens out of the blue. You and your friends decide to engage in battle/investigation, and just like in the footage, there just happens to be another collective of players nearby that decide to do the same.

This is going to be such a good way of meeting people, especially considering there's the immediate common interest in working together. I just think it'll be so nice knowing that, whilst you're exploring an open world, there's that chance that *something* will happen, and you might meet some great people.

Enough of me rambling on, I'm too excited...",,False,self,t5_2vq0w,False,,,True,t3_1g3ze8,http://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1g3ze8/is_anyone_else_as_excited_about_public_events_as/,

I really hope they have multiple character slots though.

Think of how much skills and experience you could amass on one single character in a decade, they will need a skill-tree like Path of Exile to make something as complex and intuitive for a decade of grinding and playing. 

I also like the idea that bringing my past character forward to the next Destiny game will also bring my customised armour and weapons with me, so that I really will have a unique look by year 2, then 3, then 4 and so on. 

I really hope you get some in-depth character interactions I.E. if you have had a character since Destiny and then in 'Destiny 3' NPC's will react saying how helpful you've been over the years and how much you've done for the race (or even make a nice reference to total recall if you are a Titan).

If I plant a seed on that first day, I want to spend ten years watching it grow. I just wonder, will you all be my brothers and sisters in arms for a decade? Through thick and thin, through weak weapons and sucky magic in our lower levels, can we conquer and become the largest guild; with your help brothers and sisters I believe so. 

Let us spread through the galaxy and retake what should rightfully be humanities, no more hiding in dark rooms fighting our own shadows, we are humanity and we shall never be conquered.

Tl;dr: Do you think Bungie will give us a really in-depth experience to make running the same character extremely appealing? Like in Mass Effect when you pull a character through.

This will be the foundation of my argument.

Noun

1. A group of people leading the way in new developments or ideas.
2. A position at the forefront of new developments or ideas: ""in the vanguard of technical development"".

IMO, I feel all to often people associate the word *vanguard* with a defense role. Perhaps this is because of the root word guard. However, as the above definition from Webster shows, this simply isn't the case. In fact, the word vanguard is closer to something of a scout. 

Bungie has never alluded to *The Vanguard* being a class. Every time they have used the term it has been where there is missing information using this line:

""Awaiting reports from the Vanguard""

The Vanguard is much more likely a group, department, or organization. More specifically, the group of people who are in the outskirts of the current human domain. Finding information on the lost planets of humanity and perhaps reaching further outside of our solar system. 

I would make the argument that *The Vanguard* are something of the converse of *The Guardians*.

We as *Guardians* are charged with the task of defending the final city of human kind. Comprised of Hunters, Titans, and Warlocks.

The *Vanguard* are charged with the task of finding out what happened with the rest of humanity. Likely also comprised of Hunters, Titans, and Warlocks (or their counterparts). 

There are three classes. There will likely continue to be three classes. Not saying that Bungie will not ever release any other classes, but it will likely be in the next game or in bulk with other classes.

4 is a poor number when compared to the [power of the number 3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3_\(number\)).

I know that this question will not be put to rest until we hear something official from Bungie or when Destiny is released. I'm just under the allusion that believing *The Vanguard* is another class is simply wishful thinking.

**Which is perfectly fine!** Particularly because all I really want is a sword for my Warlock. ",,False,self,t5_2vq0w,False,,,True,t3_1gnsnd,http://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1gnsnd/vanguard_is_not_a_class/,

FAQ

What is Destiny?

* Destiny is an open world first-person shooter set 700 years in the future in a post-apocalyptic world after an event known as the Collapse, which saw the mysterious dissolution of Earth's colonies and left mankind teetering on the brink of extinction. The player takes charge of one of the Guardians, the last defenders of the human race, as they try to protect the last city on Earth. Above the city hovers the Traveler, a white, spherical, celestial body that saved humanity from the Collapse, and grants the Guardians unknown powers as they venture out into the solar system once more. But hostile alien races have occupied mankind's former colonies, and so the player is tasked with finding and destroying these threats before humanity is wiped out...for good.

What kind of game is Destiny?

* A new genre Bungie calls a ""shared-world shooter."" Expect a co-operative first person shooter that automatically matchmakes a few players in the area into your game so a small party will be assembled seamlessly into the fight. 

Is it an MMO?

* No, mostly no anyways. For most of the gameplay there will only be a small party playing together–up to six as far as we know. However, in the Last City–and possibly a few other major hubs–there will be hundreds or even thousands milling about, socializing, and partying up. While this is very similar to aspects of MMOs, Bungie has been very explicit in defining it as the new genre of a 'share-world shooter,' not an MMO.

Who is the developer?

* [Bungie](http://www.bungie.net/)

Who is the publisher?

* [Activision](http://www.activision.com/atvihub/home.do)

What platforms will it be available on?

* Playstation 3, Playstation 4, and Xbox 360 are the confirmed platforms. Based on a [leaked contract](http://documents.latimes.com/bungie-activision-contract/) from an Activision trial, other 'future-generation technology,' namely the rumored Xbox 720. A PC version seems unlikely, but Bungie employees have refrained from any outright denial of a PC port.

Does it require an internet connection?

* Yes.

Is there a subscription fee?

* No.

Are there going to be micro transactions?

* Unknown.

On Xbox will I need Xbox Live Gold?

* Most likely, no official word one way or the other, but the consensus is yes, you will need it.

Will there be DLC expansions?

* Yes. The expansions are unannounced, but confirmation is based upon the [leaked contract](http://documents.latimes.com/bungie-activision-contract/). These expansions are referred to as 'Comets.

Will there be sequels?

* Yes. The [leaked contract](http://documents.latimes.com/bungie-activision-contract/) reveals four main Destiny titles along with one accompanying 'Comet' expansion per title. 

Can PlayStation and Xbox players all play together on the same servers?

* No.

Can PS3 and PS4 players play together? And Xbox 360 and Xbox 720 players?

* Unknown

When is the release date?

* Unknown. Speculation points to 2014, but there is no official release date.

Who do I play as?

* A Guardian, one of many defenders of the last city of Earth granted mysterious powers by the Traveler.

What is the Traveler?

* A mysterious large white orb that protects the Last City of Earth featured in [concept art](http://www.bungie.net/pubassets/615/traveler_s_rest_desktop.jpg). According to legend the Traveler sacrificed itself to save humanity, and now gives powers to the Guardians.

Are there character classes?

* At least three: [Titan, Hunter, and Warlock](http://www.bungie.net/pubassets/615/guardians_desktop.jpg).

Will there be character customization?

* Yes, armor, weapons, and capes will be customizable.

Who are the enemies?

* Known enemies include [The Fallen](http://www.bungie.net/pubassets/615/fallen_desktop.jpg), a four-armed, insect-like alien group; [The Vex](http://www.bungie.net/pubassets/615/vex_desktop.jpg), a group of time-traveling robots; The Cabal, a rhino-like, armored species; and 'Space Zombies,' who have appeared with variable numbers of eyes.

Are there vehicles?

* Yes. The [Pike](http://www.bungie.net/pubassets/615/pike_desktop.jpg) and the [Spider Tank](http://www.bungie.net/pubassets/615/fallen_desktop.jpg) are in released concept art.

What are the game environments?

* Environments scattered across our former colonies on Venus, Luna, and Mars have been confirmed in addition to Earth. 

* Optional expanded text: We know of the Black Garden, the Cosmodone Breach, the ruins on the edge of the European Dead Zone, the swamps of Old Chicago, the Tower, the Reef, giant obsidian pyramid ships, the Hellmouth on the Moon, the Exclusion Zone of Mars, the Cassini Derelict fleet orbiting Saturn, the Shores of Time and the Citadel on Venus.

        Am I missing any? Is the Moon known as ""Luna"" or simply ""the Moon"" in the Destiny universe? Also would the community like an expanded answer about all known locations, or simply a few highlights?

Do I get to actually fly to other planets, or will space travel happen during cutscenes and loading screens?

* Unknown.

Will there be competitive multiplayer?

* Yes. It is unknown how the competitive multiplayer system will actually work, however we do know that player-versus-player combat will only occur when both parties agree to it.

Who is working on the soundtrack for the game?

* Martin O’Donnell, Mike Salvatore, and Paul McCartney are all known to be working on the soundtrack.

I've started to lose my faith in the gaming industry lately, but I'll never lose my faith in Bungie. They delivered with 5 amazing Halo games that still sit unharmed on my shelf, and I still pop them in from time to time. I really do think this new franchise will become one of the most relatable, recognized and fantastic universes in all of science fiction for years and years to come.

The hammer of the revolver pulls back as the player pulls the trigger on the controller **before the weapon discharges.**

Which makes me believe I can actually play with the trigger of the weapon as I can my own firearms!!!

So we all should know that it's a forward line of troops- troops at the forefront of the action... the tip of the spear.  

We all know that Bungie has acknowledged the existence of the Vanguards, but has also adamantly clung to the idea of only 3 classes.  You may try and pick apart some Bungie employee's spur of the moment words, but I'm convinced there's only three classes (or at least, that the Vanguard is not a class).

We also have a solid understanding of the factions that will be available to us.

So, we know more than we give ourselves credit for.  But why, as soon as we heard the term ""Vanguard"", did we instantly assume it was related to one of the subjects we already knew about?  The odds of that, in the enormous, largely unrevealed Destiny universe, are quite small.

So who are the Vanguards?  

They could be you.  They could be me.  They're the beta testers.

It's the perfect explanation.  At the front of the action.  The first into the Wild.  Not a faction, not a mysterious fourth class.  It wouldn't be the first time Bungie made a t-shirt to commemorate those who participate.  It's so simple, it was always right there in front of us.

From the vidoc as well as several articles it sounds like Bungie is attempting to tie in social media with the game by having an app that can affect your friends in the game.

I was wanting to know what people thought this would include. I was brainstorming about how cool it would be to send out a message for help on your friends list and one of your friends that was just sitting at a restaurant, or a bus, or wherever could get a notification and pull up an overhead pinch zoomable map to drop and airstrike or supply package. This is all just speculation but I was wondering how you guys thought they could use this app to change events in game. This would be the first game to really try something like this.

* Those flying enemies are called Fallen Shanks

* A ""CRITICAL"" marker pops up when you're lining up for a one-shot kill. **EDIT: The marker comes up when you're shooting an enemy's weak spot**

* Crouching doesn't remove you from radar, at least with allies.

* ""X"" marker for fallen allies.

* Square marker for both friendlies and enemies dropping in/joining combat. 

* There's ALOT of dynamic lens flair going on, both foreground and background.

* There is **DEFINITELY REGENERATING HEALTH.** When an ally is weak their tag changes to yellow and returns to blue once they've healed. 

* When an ally is out of your line of sight an arrow shows you their current position. 

* Looks like those are gamer tags, not character names over their heads.

Firstly, what is an ARG? They're a type of online game, but more of a puzzle really, that Bungie has long cherished the use of as harbingers to the release of a new game. Some of you may remember I Love Bees, which occurred shortly before Halo 2. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Love_Bees

Now, the point of this post. I'm both saddened and a little ashamed to say I completely missed Destiny's (first?) ARG, but having discovered it and knowing their obscure nature, I wanted to share with the rest of you that keep track of this subreddit. 

Since the ARG came and passed, this forum will give you the reward that other forum users worked for in February. (Don't feel bad, they enjoyed it.) 
http://destinyhub.net/threads/82-Destiny-ARG-FINAL-DAY-SOLVED 

Once you've read into that, bear witness to the virtual treasure that was unlocked: 
http://alphalupi.bungie.net/ArraySuccessResult.html

What does all this mean? Nothing, if you don't take a little time to look at it. But if you look deeper into the meanings of each image from each day, some stunning depth and detail reveals itself. The poetry seems to refer to the Traveler in each image, and gives some fascinating implications on the Traveler's origins, methods, and purposes. 

And on the final page, you'll notice a button labeled ""Play Transmission"" which has an awe-inspiringly gorgeous, yet all-too-short musical piece from Marty O'Donnell. 

Why should you care about all this? Because this is what I believe has always set Bungie apart from other developers, and what the less attentive (and possibly more ignorant) individuals in the gaming world don't appreciate about Bungie. They have an extraordinary attention to detail in their creations, so deep that most people pass right over it because it's too small for them to see.

Hope you enjoyed it. ",,False,self,t5_2vq0w,False,,,True,t3_1fup3j,http://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1fup3j/to_those_who_missed_or_have_not_heard_of_the/,

I'm curious to know what everyone thinks about Bungie shooting for a Teen rating on Destiny. I know that this has been neither confirmed nor denied by Bungie, but there are rumors floating around that I would like your take on. 

Let's look at Halo 1: Bungie was shooting for a T rating from the MSRB, and the ratings board slapped an M on it after the Flood came into view. They threw the blood back in with a ""Why not""-esque shrug of their shoulders, and it evolved into the Halo franchise that we've all known and loved for the last ten years.

One obvious concern of mine is that the Teen rating (assuming that the rumors are true) means that things will have to be dumbed down. I have noticed (speaking generally, of course) that Teen games provide a different style of storytelling, a more juvenile approach to storytelling. Now, I realize that this is not true of all games. Look at KOTOR - Garnered a Teen rating and it's been hailed as one of the best games of all time. The Uncharted franchise - Also Teen, and it's bloody fantastic. The bar for good Teen games has been set pretty high, so my expectations are high. 

I will be buying this game day one, in whatever collector's edition that they sell. I trust Bungie to deliver something that is polished, and able to tell an immersive story, set in a persistent ten year world. 

However: There is still a small nagging corner of darkness in my mind that worries that the Teen rating could be a downfall. What are your thoughts on it? ",,False,self,t5_2vq0w,False,,,True,t3_1ihvtr,http://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1ihvtr/destiny_going_for_a_teen_rating_thoughts/,

###Rule 1:  **We would love it if everyone would follow the [Redditquette!](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette)**  

I don't really expect everyone to spend time to read the entire thing so here are the main points that we would like you to follow.

* Remember to be human. When you communicate online, all you see is a computer screen. When talking to someone you might want to ask yourself ""Would I say it to the person's face?"" or ""Would I get jumped if I said this to a buddy?""

* Read the rules of a community before making a submission. These are usually found in the sidebar.

* Moderate based on quality, not opinion. Well written and interesting content can be worthwhile, even if you disagree with it.

* Vote. If you think something contributes to conversation, upvote it. If you think it does not contribute to the subreddit it is posted in or is off-topic in a particular community, downvote it.

* Browse the new submissions page and vote on it. Regard it, perhaps, as a public service.

* Please don't be (intentionally) rude at all. By choosing not to be rude, you increase the overall civility of the community and make it better for all of us.

* Please don't conduct personal attacks on other commenters. Ad hominem and other distracting attacks do not add anything to the conversation.


###Rule 2:  **Images must be linked to the original source.**

We're implementing this rule because there have been some users uploading screenshots to their personal websites without giving credit to the original creators and to be honest, that's just not nice ;(

From now on we would love it if you can link all pictures to the original artist's page.  They deserve some recognition for their hard work!

###Rule 3:  **You must submit the original source of any news regarding Destiny.**

There has been a trend of people retelling news through YouTube &amp; other websites, and we think it would be best to only allow the original source of the new info to get posted. 

This way we'll be able to make our own interpretations of the newly released info, and it would give credit to the original people that spent time and effort to get this new information from Bungie.

--- 

###We now have a community page!

[Click here to go check it out!](http://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/wiki/seventh_column)

Here you will you be able to find a comprehensive list of all community websites, YouTube accounts, and social networking accounts that relate to Destiny.  Official links will be branded as such, and please be free to contact me if you would like your accounts added to our page!

---

###I have one more thing to say.


Please be free to use this thread to post your recommendations on any new rules you would like us to enforce, and  please be free to post any suggestions you may have for this subreddit.  The moderators are here to make this subreddit as best as it can be, and we need your assistance to help bring us towards our ultimate goal for world domination.

If there is some actual new info out there go ahead and post it but the amount of repost seen here is crazy and just plain ol outlandish.

The speculation and ideas in this sub are great but some of the speculation questions just seem to make little to no sense 70% of the time because it'll be a question like ""what made the vex and why do they do what they do?"", questions like this cannot be answered because the lore hasn't been much of even talked about yet, so it's like asking yourself what you'll be doing in 2 months when you haven't planned for anything. A simple google search or search on the sub can answer a lot of questions.

Now I don't want to sound negative all through this post so I would like to mention that some of the people in this sub are finally starting to point out to others about reposted info as well as pointing out old info mistaken as new info and that's great! Also, I'm starting to take note of good speculation and ideas starting to bubble to the top and I'm happy to see these post finally arriving after seeing what seems to be the same exact thing posted for months now.

TL:DR: repost are getting pretty crazy for such a small sub. Don't ask things that cannot be currently answered. Seeing original and creative post are amazing compared to old news.

So, here's [the full poem by Rudyard Kipling](http://www.poetryloverspage.com/poets/kipling/law_of_jungle.html)

&gt;*Now this is the Law of the Jungle -- as old and as true as the sky;*

&gt;*And the Wolf that shall keep it may prosper, but the Wolf that shall break it must die.*

&gt;*As the creeper that girdles the tree-trunk the Law runneth forward and back --*

&gt;*For the strength of the Pack is the Wolf, and the strength of the Wolf is the Pack.*

&gt;Wash daily from nose-tip to tail-tip; drink deeply, but never too deep;

&gt;And remember the night is for hunting, and forget not the day is for sleep.

&gt;The Jackal may follow the Tiger, but, Cub, when thy whiskers are grown,

&gt;Remember the Wolf is a Hunter -- go forth and get food of thine own.

&gt;Keep peace withe Lords of the Jungle -- the Tiger, the Panther, and Bear.

&gt;And trouble not Hathi the Silent, and mock not the Boar in his lair.

&gt;When Pack meets with Pack in the Jungle, and neither will go from the trail,

&gt;Lie down till the leaders have spoken -- it may be fair words shall prevail.

&gt;When ye fight with a Wolf of the Pack, ye must fight him alone and afar,

&gt;Lest others take part in the quarrel, and the Pack be diminished by war.

&gt;The Lair of the Wolf is his refuge, and where he has made him his home,

&gt;Not even the Head Wolf may enter, not even the Council may come.

&gt;The Lair of the Wolf is his refuge, but where he has digged it too plain,

&gt;The Council shall send him a message, and so he shall change it again.

&gt;If ye kill before midnight, be silent, and wake not the woods with your bay,

&gt;Lest ye frighten the deer from the crop, and your brothers go empty away.

&gt;Ye may kill for yourselves, and your mates, and your cubs as they need, and ye can;

&gt;But kill not for pleasure of killing, and seven times never kill Man!

&gt;If ye plunder his Kill from a weaker, devour not all in thy pride;

&gt;Pack-Right is the right of the meanest; so leave him the head and the hide.

&gt;The Kill of the Pack is the meat of the Pack. Ye must eat where it lies;

&gt;And no one may carry away of that meat to his lair, or he dies.

&gt;The Kill of the Wolf is the meat of the Wolf. He may do what he will;

&gt;But, till he has given permission, the Pack may not eat of that Kill.

&gt;Cub-Right is the right of the Yearling. From all of his Pack he may claim

&gt;Full-gorge when the killer has eaten; and none may refuse him the same.

&gt;Lair-Right is the right of the Mother. From all of her year she may claim

&gt;One haunch of each kill for her litter, and none may deny her the same.

&gt;Cave-Right is the right of the Father -- to hunt by himself for his own:

&gt;He is freed of all calls to the Pack; he is judged by the Council alone.

&gt;Because of his age and his cunning, because of his gripe and his paw,

&gt;In all that the Law leaveth open, the word of your Head Wolf is Law.

Blizzard started making code name Titan in 2006-7. It's been said countless times that it aims to be a ""Halo MMO."" Although, they havent released anything about it.

Bungie started making code name Tiger in 2007. I'm not sure exactly when Activision started funding the project, but its coincidental that Activision-Blizzard is the holding company of... Activision Blizzard.

There are some other interesting tidbits relating to the two games but I just thought I'd point it out.

Am I crazy?

edit: rumor that titan is for consoles only (like destiny) http://massively.joystiq.com/2013/01/01/rumor-blizzards-titan-is-not-a-new-ip-and-could-be-heading-to/

edit 2: Ok, let me go through the slew of coincidences that we have.

1.  The original Halo MMO that was being designed by Ensemble Studios was code named ‘Titan.’  Also, Ghostcrawler (Blizzard Game Developer) happened to be a former employee of said company.  Blizzard’s secret MMO is titled ‘Titan.’  Coincidence? Maybe.

2.  In February 2007, an episode of 30 Rock entitled Hardball aired and in the credits it said, “Promotional Consideration Furnished by Blizzard Entertainment.”  What makes this interesting is that no Blizzard products were featured.  No Warcraft.  No Starcraft.  No Diablo.  No World of Warcraft.  However, Halo was featured in the show!  So Blizzard was advertising for Halo in 2007?  This was right before word got out that Blizzard was working on a brand new MMO and they started hiring “Science-Fiction Texture Artists.”  Coincidence? Maybe.

3.  As we know Bungie and Activision (now Activision-Blizzard) are in a 10 year partnership and some terms of the agreement were not disclosed.  Coincidence? Maybe.

4.  Jeff Kaplan, a Blizzard employee was quoted as saying “All of those combined” to the following question in an MTV Multiplayer Interview:  Will the next Blizzard MMO be “sci-fi, near-future, post-apocalyptic, or historical?”  Now, all of the above would definitely apply to Halo.  Coincidence? Maybe

Over the past few days, a few admins and I have been actively working on creating a guild for Destiny players. We have started early in hopes of building a strong and large community that will be ready to play Destiny together upon release! 

The opportunities are endless with this guild, and we are always open for suggestions on how to improve and adjust it! Currently, our ultimate goal is to provide a location for people to meet, organize raids, trade, and keep up on the latest Destiny news. There will undoubtedly be many more services and outlets on the site, so it will be dynamic.

In my own view, I foresee the creation of a small army filled with ranks that can be elevated through gameplay and contribution. How cool would it be to get 20-30 (or more!) Vanguardians together to battle an enemy clan? Or take out a big boss and reap the rewards? It excites me just thinking about it. 

We would LOVE for you to come by and join. All you need to do is create an Enjin account (can be found on the page), and fill out a VERY quick application just so we know who you are. 

Our site can be found here: http://vanguardians.enjin.com/home 

Join us. If we can capture enough growth this guild can be a leader in the game, and so can YOU. Again, we encourage and appreciate participation. ALL suggestions and feedback will be carefully considered, and we will keep you involved in the process. 

Become a VANGUARDIAN. Become the best.

From what I can tell there are only two real options as far as actionable material by the name of Osiris unless they've based a part of the game on Osiris shoes (which I’m sure are great... but I doubt the Caswell VLC, as comfortable as it is, was the catalyst) . For the sake of this article I’ll just go ahead and focus on the first two. There is, of course, the Egyptian god but there is also a lesser known planet by the same name. I’m not suggesting that Bungie has copy-pasted ancient history directly into the game, but if Bungie saw fit to name a faction as well as an NPC Osiris it might give us a bit of insight into the characteristics, or a feel for what is coming down the pipes. Look at it this way; if I’m way off on this we’ll all have learned some random facts that will invariably resurface in 20 years when we’re all old and watching reruns of Jeopardy.

For starters I’ll go to the beginning of where this all started for me. We had only just learned that there were five factions, I was pouring over the logos for each trying to figure out which I liked more. Dead Orbit stood out like a sore thumb, I like the simplicity of it, and Osiris looked unfinished. It just looked coarse compared to the stylized logos of the other four. While I stared I wondered if the eye had anything to do with Osiris and punched it in on Wikipedia, that’s where I got interested. There is an eye glyph in hieroglyph that represents Osiris, it can be used in relation to vision, or “to do”, or “to make”. That didn't really jump out at me but the image of Osiris cried out. 

His skin color was similar to that of the Awoken. If you Google images of Osiris you’ll find a whole host of pictures which depict him in a whole variety of greens, and black. It was too late, I was sucked in and I spent the next couple of hours digging around and reading up on Osiris. Let me save you the trouble. Osiris was a central god in Egyptian mythology/religion. He was the god of the afterlife and the underworld. He was the king of the land of the dead. The abridged version of his story is that he married his sister (Isis), was betrayed by his brother (Set) who killed him. Isis brought Osiris back to life long enough to conceive his child, the magic wore off and he turned into a pumpk... died again. There are a couple of different accounts that describe when Osiris was dismembered and strewn about the desert, but it’s universally told that he got hacked up, and his “phallus” was lost or eaten by a fish... then eventually replaced by a golden one when he was reassembled (if you've got it, flaunt it!). So now Isis has gone and put together a Franken-deity, and all of the other gods figure she’s put in the effort the least they could do is resurrect Osiris one more time. They went one step further this time, and on this third coming they made him the ruler of the underworld, and the after life... and resurrection (I guess they figured that it would be easier if he could just do it himself from now on). Osiris’ son was Horus. Horus and Isis avenged Osiris and killed Set.

Okay, that’s the bulk of the heavy lifting, from here it’s all easy. Osiris, as god of resurrection, was very much an agricultural god and was linked to the growing cycles, as well as the burial rights that would assure a Pharaoh’s passage into the underworld (which was thought to be in the west). When he was depicted in paintings associated with rebirth or resurrection he was green, and black for death (and fertility referring to the nutrient rich, dark soil along the Nile). My first thought was that the Awoken must be somehow associated with Osiris (the faction). Originally because of the similarity in color, and then as I thought about it I thought there was also a similarity in implications between the terms Awoken and Resurrected.

The next piece of the puzzle that caught my eye was in the mail sac titled “When You Wish Upon A Mail Sac”. About a quarter of the way down the page I read a question that grabbed my attention.

""Player3Thomas: Would you please name a NPC after me?

DeeJ: Only if you change your name to Osiris. Or, Uncredited Robot #7.""

I don’t know about you, but that doesn't seem to leave a lot of room for error. That pretty much comes out and screams there’s someone named Osiris in Destiny. From the bits and bobs I've read about Osiris I was wondering what was likely to be used and what would be out of place. For example I doubt that Bungie thought “you know what you don’t see in a lot of games these days? Inbreeding! We could be the first!”. Compelling story elements could be drawn from Osiris' betrayal by his brother. His resurrection (heh... bet you can’t guess what auto correct just tried to spell) also fits in nicely with the science-fantasy genre. Much more speculation than that is really reaching, but it’s easy to imagine where they could go with it.

There’s one more thing I’d like to look at before I wrap this all up. It doesn't necessarily have to do with Osiris, but it has everything to do with the Egyptian connection I've been staring at for so long. There is one piece of concept art that grabbed my attention early on. It stands out, it looks awesome, and it’s everything I want out of a science-fantasy world. Something that looks cool, magical, and high tech all at the same time. 

It’s the image of Onyx Pyramid ships rising through what look to be clouds that are floating in space around a planet. In that same mail sac I mentioned before there had been a question about what was their favorite sky box in the game. A couple of the locations had been [redacted], and it got me hoping that the planet in the clouds might have made it into the game. My efforts were fruitless in that regard, I thought the planet looked a bit like mars or Venus (it still could be either); however, while I was looking at the concept art I finally made the connection. Egypt. There is a faction and an NPC named after and Egyptian god, and there are giant Pyramid space ships. I thought the connection was good enough to look a little deeper, and began to look into any connections Osiris may have with a planet. And you'll never guess what I found.

This is where Egyptian mythology gets a bit disjointed. There are different accounts of the Osiris Myth. I won’t get into all of them but one source I found mentioned two opinions. One considered “Typhon to be the solar world and Osiris to be the lunar world”, the other that “Osiris, as the sun, has physical union with Isis, as the moon”. Okay, okay, who the hell is Typhon? I’ll quote a block from Wikipedia... it’s just easier that way.

""Diodorus Siculus gives another version of the myth in which Osiris was described as an ancient king who taught the Egyptians the arts of civilization, including agriculture, then travelled to the world with his sister Isis, the satyrs, and the nine muses, before finally returning to Egypt. Osiris was then murdered by his evil brother Typhon, who was identified with Set. Typhon divided the body into twenty six pieces, which he distributed amongst his fellow conspirators in order to implicate them in the murder. Isis and Horus avenged the death of Osiris and slew Typhon. Isis recovered all the parts of Osiris’ body, except the phallus, and secretly buried them. She made replicas of them and distributed them to several location, which then became centres of Osiris worship”

That’s who Typhon is, I’ll let you draw your own conclusions.

The other connection I found was planet HD 209458, aka Osiris. Osiris orbits good old solar analog star HD 209458 (it’s got a real ring to it) about 150 light years away, somewhere in the Pegasus constellation. Osiris is BIG, 2.5 times larger than Jupiter, and it’s a gas giant as well... sort of. It was the first of a new kind of planet discovered. It is losing its atmosphere, it’s literally evaporating off. From my understanding it is currently shedding hydrogen, and has an atmosphere that consists of Oxygen, Carbon, and water vapor. I geeked out on this pretty hard, but I’ll spare you the painful details... because this is just wild speculation, but that picture of the planet surrounded by clouds in space resonates with me. Maybe they just put the clouds there because they look cool, maybe the Pyramid ships made them, maybe that’s the steam from Mars’ polar ice caps that evaporated and then froze into giant clouds of frozen mist... or maybe it’s an artist’s rendition of what planet Osiris looks like, and is where the Pyramid ships call home.

So what do we get out of all of this? Perhaps a faint outline of what is being created. Osiris, the progenitor of civilization, betrayed and resurrected a god, watches over the dead, and the lands of the west. There’s a lot of good material to play with there... and that’s just one person, one faction, one race. As I've said, this is just speculation, but unless Bungie simply chose the name because it sounded good they don’t exactly have an abundance of Osiris’ to choose from.

I've been a long time fan of Bungie and their games. I remember playing Pathways Into Darkness on the Mac when I was a kid. Playing the Marathon games took up countless hours as I got older. I'm 29 now and I've watched Bungie go from small time to one of the biggest game studios. In high school I marveled at Halo when I heard Bungie was making it. I bought the Xbox just for that game. It turned out my passion for their games was well placed as the Halo franchise is now one of Microsoft's flagship titles. 

I created this account just for the opportunity to throw some of my work at the new Destiny IP which has captured my imagination and taken up my free time. I've been pegging away at different concept art for armors and weapons. I'd like to share them with you.

[Ionian Titan](http://i.imgur.com/pO1vaqV)

TLDR: I drew some stuff. Look at it.

-----------------------------------------

EDIT: Thanks for the kind words, everyone. Here's another piece done a little differently. The first was all digital and this one is done half and half. I penciled it and then scanned it to color it in Photoshop. It's much cleaner than the other one but it lacks that painterly feel IMO. Anyway, the concept was to pay homage to Anime since at GDC Bungie mentioned taking influences more from anime for their armor designs. I loved Jin-Roh and decided maybe it would be cool for there to be a rare armor on Mars that looks very similar to the [Wolf Brigade armor](http://i.imgur.com/7UCKd4E). The weapon is similar to the German MG-42, I call it ""Oma's House"" in reference to Little Red Riding Hood and the german origin of the gun.

TLDR: I drew something else. Look at it.


EDIT 2: Okay, here's another. It's a [hunter](http://i.imgur.com/lD7upyw) this time. His mask is a nod to the Hunters from Marathon who had 3 green eyes, not Sam Fisher. I tried to tell a story with this one. Can you figure it out?

EDIT 3: Here's a new one: [Wild West Warlock](http://i.imgur.com/HtFbJSm) 

EDIT 4: Aaaaand another. This will be the last for a little while. It's my idea for [Marathon Armor](http://i.imgur.com/ztC5wKl). It's a bit too MC. 

EDIT 5: Here's a silhouette study. It's just different configurations for auto and revolver [pistols](http://i.imgur.com/RqyV82p). I didn't bother with doing any aesthetic stuff for this one and also the guns are a bit old school (not really sci-fi enough). I focused mainly on the shapes and trying out different combinations. Let me know which ones you like. If you guys like this kind of thing let me know. 

If at all possible I'd like for you to share this stuff if you think it's cool. And if any of you have requests or ideas feel free to PM me with as detailed of a description as you'd like.

So I really really hope that Bungie implements a robust and highly specific player preference system to filter who and who doesn't get to jump into your campaign missions.


Here are some options I'd like to see:

- **Age**.  I'm an adult.  I do NOT want to play with children.  Let me filter out anyone under 18 please.

- **Experience**.  I have a full time job, and kids.  I'll probably get to play Destiny about 5 hours a week.  Do not place me alongside people who play 5 hours a day.  Seriously, they'll jack all my kills.

- **Behavior**.  Has someone been reported for racist remarks, or poor sportsmanship?  Don't pair them with me... Ever.

- **Play Style**.  If I want to be a nerd, and ""get into character"" while playing.  Hook me up with people that want to do the same (MMOs have whole servers dedicated to this, btw).  I don't want to be saving the Earth, and then have some stranger start asking me about who I think is going to the playoffs.

- **Connection**.  I will not tolerate lag during the campaign.  If someone has a crap connection, don't drop them into my game.  Just don't!....  And if they are lagging, let me boot them... And if I boot them, or if they drop from the game, don't just poof them out of my game - have AI take over their avatar until I'm done with my mission!

- **Timezone**.  If you're going to force me to hook up with random people.  Send me people from my own Timezone.  That way, if I make some new friends, I can rely on pairing up with them again.",,False,self,t5_2vq0w,False,,,True,t3_18sutu,http://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/18sutu/destiny_needs_a_robust_player_preference_system/,

Given what we know, I'm definitely expecting a MAG/Planetside type experience. You know: the lore establishes certain warring factions, and you do the warring. Like Halo MP, but on a greater scale, and with greater depth and variety and customization. 

The question is, what *more* can Destiny do? The MMOFPS is fairly well established. What will be Destiny's 'USP', what will make it stand out (except for Bungie's general superior touch)? Well, there's a few ways it might stand out. 

Firstly: by having a story and lore that's actually interesting. 

Secondly: by integrating a single player experience... maybe we'll get a single player campaign, or even a Horde/Firefight/SOps-style co-op mode.

Thirdly: by really embracing space battles, and making them integral.

Fourthly: by embracing user-created content in some big way. Bungie have always been major advocates.

So I was on the Bungie website just a minute ago, looking at some delicious art for Destiny, when I was thinking of something pretty interesting: what happens under the traveler. But more specifically: the center of the city that would seem to be covered in shadow for almost all of the day. I know you can get sick if you don't go out into the sun for too long (At least, physically weak) in real life, and I thought it would be cool if there wasn't much plant life the farther you go into the city. It gets darker as the traveler blocks out more of the sun and buildings become cooler, almost cold. Nothing gets light for more than an hour or two a day and it could almost feel like it were a second night time.  
  
I would love, LOVE, dialogue and conversations about how the ""second sun is about to rise today"", in regards to the inner city only getting sunlight when the sun first rises and then again when it falls. Just going that extra mile to truly capture your audience and suspend their disbelieve enough to where they actual feel the universe is real is exactly what Bungie is good at. I feel like they could truly cover how the traveler has not only saved humanity, but also caused new troubles for people in more ways than we can think of.",,False,self,t5_2vq0w,False,,,True,t3_1f2a3f,http://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1f2a3f/the_darkness_of_the_traveler/,

So, after the gameplay reveal, I've been going around to a lot of forums and just seeing what people thought of the game thus far.  So far, the response is very positive.  The people who have been praising the game are keeping in mind that the demo we saw was in fact that, a demo.  Nothing more.  Plus, supposedly the demo was built specifically for E3.

The people who have been on the more negative side of the game seem to think that what we saw at E3 is going to represent the entire game, which I don't think is fair at all.  To judge an entire game like this, to just write it off based on around 10 minutes of a gameplay demo in a starter zone, is crazy.

What we saw at E3 is exactly what I expected to see, a little bit of this, a little bit of that.  If you were expecting to see like, max level PvP or raids with all the crazy guns, you were out of your mind.  Destiny is still, I'm going to guess, a year away from release, the game is in pre-alpha still.  For all we know, that kind of stuff isn't even done yet.

So to anyone who might still be on edge about Destiny, just keep all that in mind.  It was 10 minutes of a demo, specifically built for E3, in a starter zone.  If you really think the rest of the game is going to be like that, I think you're crazy.

What was everyone's opinion on the gameplay reveal?  I'm talking any aspect, how it was revealed, what was revealed, what didn't you see that you wanted to see (within reason), etc.  ",,False,self,t5_2vq0w,False,,,True,t3_1glyyq,http://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1glyyq/post_e3_gameplay_reveal_discussion/,

So I don't know if you guys have heard of Ascend: New Gods, but its a game that has jump in/jump out co-op somewhat like Destiny and that's pretty much where the similarities end.

One of the developers over at Signal Studios had this to say when asked about if a player on the Xbox could play with someone on the Next Gen Xbox

""Time will tell us as we get closer to next gen but we don't anticipate any issues.""

This hopefully means that cross gen play will at least be possible in Destiny, though these feature has not been confirmed, I have reached out to Bungie for comment. Sadly though, there is still no news about cross platform play for Destiny.

Armor and weapon discussion inside.",kousi,18,2,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/191etg/since_we_dont_know_lets_speculate_armor_and/,"I watched the [Destiny Information Roundup](http://youtu.be/ikE7jQHRZWM ""Game recognize game, grandpa."") last night which mentioned something about each piece of armor will be a story to tell, and I assume will be somewhat unique (like Borderlands items, as the video mentioned).

Now what I'm trying to do is reconcile unique armor and weapons with baseline competitiveness.  For armor this is pretty easy to speculate on: my first and only guess so far is that each piece of armor will have:

A) A model    
B) A color    
C) A visual effect (optional)    

Or 2 of the 3, leaving the 3rd customizable by the player somehow.  I think it'd be cool to have to work a bit for a complete matching set of armor, though I suppose it would suck to get the right helmet model, but have it in a completely non-matching color.  But I imagine armor effects could be something like the flaming helmets in Reach and whatnot.

What I can't really wrap my head around is weapons.  If weapons are indeed like Borderlands, it could effect gameplay in that the bearer could gg all content (or gg a big part of it) and be recruited to the top clan just based on a roll.  In PVP it obviously would effect things a lot more, and remove the competitive nature.   I can't come up with an alternative scenario though, perhaps weapon color?

Which follows the *7 Layers of Heaven*, theory. The world is flat and the Earth is the center of the universe. The symbols correspond with the seven deities, the only objects in our solar system that can be seen with the naked eye.

However, an army of atrophying bodies isn't very effective against advanced alien races. Using their technology they had cybornetically enhanced them. Including onboard extension for verbal communications. As well as exo-skeletons etc. Bungie describes the Exo to be ruthless, and sinister creatures.

Thus far, we know that Bungie is intending to include tons of different armor pieces for out mix-n-match pleasure, but how are we as the players going to be able to manipulate that armor? Can we color individual pieces? Or will we be stuck throwing together mismatched piecemeal armor and hoping it looks okay?

Also, in the character species reveal, they talked about how humans are based on athletes and action heroes, Exo are metallic killing machines, and Awoken are Space Elves. Does this mean we actually get to edit our character's appearance, or will we just be [species here] in name alone and spend our lives trapped in a stuffy helmet?

What about weapons? Will they be class-restricted (e.g. only Hunters can use Sniper Rifles, only Titans can use HMGs) or will classes receive bonuses for class-specific weapons, and penalties for using a weapon outside their proficiency?

I bring this up because the Activision hype machine is just starting not with the reveal that happened on the 17th but I have noticed ads starting to get plastered in youtube videos as well as on side bars and everywhere else you can slap an ad.

So with that being said we will most likely be getting a influx of people to this sub-reddit soon and having guidelines for posting (images,links, etc.) would be a very good step.

Also flair.

Because bitches love flair.

So lets use this thread as a way to get suggestions together for this sub-reddit to help the mods out!

List so far:

* Posting guidelines

* Flair

* add the IGN FAQ as a link to the side of this page or create a thread with in this sub-reddit that is a FAQ (Help make it so we don't see the same threads popping up everywhere)

* Try to keep it Meme free (some images are nice but try to keep it discussion based )

* Something like r/Halo

* my body is ready is an acceptable here as a meme

*  spot reserved on the sidebar for information

Slowly Updating this thread as more pop up guys!

I think I have never been as excited for a game before. 
I have been lurking here since there were about 300 subscribers and have never had the guts to add anything. 
Well, I was wondering just *how* much you can fiddle with your outfits and armor in the game. Does anyone have any intel that I haven't dug up? I need answers, badly.
Also, have you decided what you will be? Race? Class?

When I play games I get immersed. It makes the total playtime for games like Red Dead Redemption and Fallout 3 a lot longer because when I play I feel like I am the character who I'm controlling. For instance, I walk **a lot** when I'm not in battle. 
But anyway, I will most likely be a Human Hunter, I want to be deadly and not always have the odds in my favor. Also, I like to play stealthily and use the Sniper Rifle. 
 
As I said, I'm quite excited, so please give me your thoughts.

Would you guys at /r/DestinyTheGame be interested in a series called Destiny Facts, or Destiny Tidbits or something like that.

Each week I'd post a couple videos, around 30-90 seconds long (short and easy to watch) that would detail a small aspect about Destiny. Some facts you may know, some may shed light on something you have not yet heard of.

Does a series like this sound promising?

- Destiny Tidbits #1 - Titan Class
- Destiny Tidbits #2 - Hunter Class
- Destiny Tidbits #3 - Warlock Class
- Destiny Tidbits #4 - The Traveler
- Destiny Tidbits #5 - Multiplayer in Destiny

**FAQ**
    
What is Destiny?
    
    Someone help me come up with a description, I'm not good with that stuff

What kind of game is Destiny?

* A new genre Bungie calls a ""shared world shooter."" Expect a co-operative FPS that automatically matchmakes a few players in the area into your game so a small party will be assembled seamlessly into the fight. 

Is it an MMO?

* No, mostly no anyways. For most of the gameplay there will only be a small party playing together, up to six as far as we know. However in the Last City, and possibly a few other major hubs, there will be hundreds or even thousands milling about, socializing and partying up, but the large part of the game will be the new genre of a ""shared world shooter."" 

What platforms will it be available on?
    
* Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, and  “future generation technology” (Xbox 720). A PC version seems unlikely, but hasn't been completely ruled out, stay tuned. 

Does it require an Internet connection?
    
* Yes.
    
Is there a subscription fee?
    
* No.

Are there going to be micro transactions?
    
* Unknown.

On Xbox will I need Xbox Live Gold?
    
* Most likely, no official word one way or the other, but almost certainly yes.

Will there be DLC expansions?

* Yes, they are unannounced, but a leaked contract indicated an expansion named ""Comet"" will be released.

Will there be sequels?

* Yes, Bungie and Activision's leaked contract reveals 4 Destiny titles, along with one DLC ""Comet"" expansion per title.
    
Can PlayStation and Xbox players all play together on the same servers?
    
* No.
    
 Can PS3 and PS4 players play together? And Xbox 360 and Xbox 720 players?
    
* We don’t know yet.
    
 When is the release date?
    
* 2014, historically Bungie has released titles in September, but there is no official release date.
    
Who do I play as?
    
* A Guardian, one of many defenders of the last city of Earth granted mysterious powers by the Traveler.
    
Are there character classes?
    
* At least three: Titan, Hunter, and Warlock, and hints at others.
    
Will there be character customization?
    
* Yes, armor, weapons, ships.
    
Who are the enemies?
    
* We know of the four-armed insect-like Fallen, the “space zombies,” the time-traveling robots known as the Vex, and the rhino-like Cabal.
    
Are there vehicles?
    
* Yes, we know of the Pike and the Spider Tank, more are certainly to follow.

What are the game environments?
    
* The various former colonies, satellites and installations in the Solar System. We know of the Cosmodone Breach, the ruins on the edge of the European Dead Zone, the swamps of Old Chicago, the Tower, the Reef, giant obsidian pyramid ships, the Hellmouth on the Moon, the Exclusion Zone of Mars, the Cassini Derelict fleet orbiting Saturn, the Citadel on Venus.
  
        Am I missing any?
    
Do I get to actually fly to other planets, or will space travel happen during cutscenes and loading screens?
    
* We’re not sure yet, but Bungie hinted at actual space gameplay.
    
Will there be competitive multiplayer?
    
* Yes, it is unknown how the PvP system will actually work, but it will likely be in an arena of sorts, otherwise the game is mostly co-op.
    
Who is working on the soundtrack for the game?
    
* Marty O’Donnell, Mike Salvatore, and Paul McCartney.

It's well worth the re-read.

[http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-02-17-destiny-bungie-unveils-its-shared-world-shooter](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-02-17-destiny-bungie-unveils-its-shared-world-shooter)

**Here are some of the stand-out quotes:**

&gt; Activision Publishing boss Eric Hirshberg says it's not an MMO. No, it most definitely is not an MMO. And Activision most definitely will not charge a subscription fee for it. ""As we saw Destiny come together,"" he says, ""we realised it belonged to a genre we couldn't quite pin down.""

&gt; ""We realised to refer to Destiny as any one of these pre-existing genres would almost be to undersell or under-promise what we think it could deliver to gamers, because we think it has the capacity to deliver a new experience,"" Hirshberg continues.

&gt; Hirshberg has coined a different phrase. He calls Destiny the ""world's first shared-world shooter"".

&gt; ""There's been a lot of rumours that we're working on an MMOFPS, whatever that is, or a social game,"" Jason Jones, Bungie co-founder and Destiny project director, says. ""The truth is, if you enjoy first-person shooters and you play them on console, Destiny's going to be the best one you've ever played. That's our goal.

&gt; ""We've learned our lessons from MMOs. We've learned our lessons from Facebook games. But Destiny is a console first-person shooter. It's the kind of game we love to play and it's the game our fans love to play.""

&gt; This is a setting Bungie calls ""mythic science fiction"", a futuristic place with age, history and mystery.

What is Destiny?

* Destiny is an open world first-person shooter set 700 years in the future in a post-apocalyptic world after an event known as the Collapse, which saw the mysterious dissolution of Earth's colonies and left mankind teetering on the brink of extinction. The player takes charge of one of the Guardians, the last defenders of the human race, as they try to protect the last city on Earth. Above the city hovers the Traveler, a white, spherical, celestial body that saved humanity from the Collapse, and grants the Guardians unknown powers as they venture out into the solar system once more. But hostile alien races have occupied mankind's former colonies, and so the player is tasked with finding and destroying these threats before humanity is wiped out...for good.

What kind of game is Destiny?

* A new genre Bungie calls a ""shared-world shooter."" Expect a co-operative first person shooter that automatically matchmakes a few players in the area into your game so a small party will be assembled seamlessly into the fight. 

Is it an MMO?

* No. Mostly no anyways. For most of the gameplay there will only be a small party playing together–up to six as far as we know. However, in the Last City–and possibly a few other major hubs–there will be hundreds or even thousands milling about, socializing, and partying up. While this is very similar to aspects of MMOs, Bungie has been very explicit in defining it as the new genre of a 'share-world shooter,' not an MMO.

Who is the developer?

* [Bungie](http://www.bungie.net/)

Who is the publisher?

* [Activision](http://www.activision.com/atvihub/home.do)

What is it rated?

* Currently unrated, but a Teen rating is expected. As always online interactions are not rated.

What platforms will it be available on?

* Playstation 3, Playstation 4, and Xbox 360 are the confirmed platforms. Based on a [leaked contract](http://documents.latimes.com/bungie-activision-contract/) from an Activision trial, other ""future-generation technology,"" namely the rumored Xbox 720, is also to be targeted. A PC version seems unlikely, but Bungie employees have refrained from any outright denial of a PC port.

Does it require an internet connection?

* Yes.

Is there a subscription fee?

* No.

Are there going to be micro transactions?

* Unknown.

On Xbox will I need Xbox Live Gold?

* Most likely. No official word one way or the other, but the consensus is yes, you will need it.

Will there be DLC expansions?

* Yes. The expansions are unannounced, but confirmation is based upon the [leaked contract](http://documents.latimes.com/bungie-activision-contract/). These expansions are referred to as ""Comets"".

Will there be sequels?

* Yes. The [leaked contract](http://documents.latimes.com/bungie-activision-contract/) reveals four main Destiny titles along with one accompanying 'Comet' expansion per title. 

Can PlayStation and Xbox players all play together on the same servers?

* No.

Can PS3 and PS4 players play together? And Xbox 360 and Xbox 720 players?

* Unknown

When is the release date?

* Unknown. Speculation points to 2014, but there is no official release date.

Who do I play as?

* A Guardian, one of many defenders of the last city of Earth granted mysterious powers by the Traveler.

What is the Traveler?

* A mysterious large white orb that protects the Last City of Earth featured in [concept art](http://www.bungie.net/pubassets/615/traveler_s_rest_desktop.jpg). According to legend the Traveler sacrificed itself to save humanity, and now gives powers to the Guardians.

Are there character classes?

* At least three: [Titan, Hunter, and Warlock](http://www.bungie.net/pubassets/615/guardians_desktop.jpg).

Will there be character customization?

* Yes, armor, weapons, and capes will be customizable.

Who are the enemies?

* Known enemies include [The Fallen](http://www.bungie.net/pubassets/615/fallen_desktop.jpg), a four-armed, insect-like alien group; [The Vex](http://www.bungie.net/pubassets/615/vex_desktop.jpg), a group of time-traveling robots; The Cabal, a rhino-like, armored species; and 'Space Zombies,' who have appeared with variable numbers of eyes.

Are there vehicles?

* Yes. The [Pike](http://www.bungie.net/pubassets/615/pike_desktop.jpg) and the [Spider Tank](http://www.bungie.net/pubassets/615/fallen_desktop.jpg) are in released concept art.

What are the game environments?

* Environments scattered across our former colonies on Venus, Luna, and Mars have been confirmed in addition to Earth. 

Do I get to actually fly to other planets, or will space travel happen during cutscenes and loading screens?

* Unknown.

Will there be competitive multiplayer?

* Yes. It is unknown how the competitive multiplayer system will actually work, however we do know that player-versus-player combat will only occur when both parties agree to it.

**TL;DR: I theorize that Destiny will feature a raking system that represents player skill instead of experience.**

I'm not quite convinced that the leveling system in Destiny is going to follow the typical RPG system where you gather experience, level-up, rinse, repeat. This formula has been done in a thousand games, and specifically in shooters such as Borderlands, which is great fun but, Bungie is claiming to have something brand new. What if levels represent your skill level as opposed to your experience level as in Reach's Arena or ranked playlists in Halo 3. Bungie keeps pointing out that they will have a matchmaking system, which is something that measures skill and tries to make a fair fight between opponents, why waste such a system if levels only reflect your XP level? 

What I am thinking is that Bungie will say have a level 10 boss in a public event, and matchmaking will throw in a level 3 guardian, one that's level 17, another is level 10, one is 8, and the last 12, so the average is 10 versus 10. What is important to note is that the level 3 does just as much damage as the 17 and has an equal shot at killing the boss, but that 17 is simply a far more skilled player, so in all likelihood he will do the most for the team. 

If you notice at the Sony reveal the player is a level 7, but it seems that he helped destroy the Devil Walker just as much as the two level 20's helped, which would not happen in a typical XP based leveling system. In many RPG's a level 7 might as well be shooting marshmallows in comparison to a level 20, but this does not seem to be the case.

I really thought it'd be a cool idea. 
   The idea that, perhaps, The Traveler marketed itself as a beacon of hope to the remains of Earth's populace via propaganda and forced manipulation. I'll even go so far as to consider him of more like a Big Brother figure than a savior. The Traveler may be expressing himself as a savior, when in reality he could be exploiting the Earthlings. 
   The classes may even play into this fancy, too. The name ""Awoken"" implies that they've been blessed with great a channel of knowledge and power via The Traveler's influence, but what if instead this race is *brainwashed* by The Traveler rather than enlightened? And the Exo's perhaps could be rebels or people who knew too much and were then converted into autonomous beings to silence them? 
   And it runs an interesting parallel with what little Bungie has told about the game. As far as we know, we're being convinced that we will be guardians and heroes. But, much like the supposedly two-faced Traveller I've described, could Bungie be leading us on to believe that we'll be saviors as opposed to conquerors or villains?
   I'd like to iterate that this is all conjecture, but it was an interesting thought that I figure I'd express to you guys and maybe dive deeper into the possibility.

Seeing as we got a trailer at the PS4 reveal, you'd think we would get something at this one as well.  However, Microsoft is making it sound like this reveal will really focus on the hardware and console itself with games being shown off at E3.

Personally I don't really think we'll be seeing it, if they do show any games there, I believe it would only be MS owned exclusives (e.g. Halo, Gears of War, Forza, etc).  But what do you guys think?  Will they show some footage there?

Does that mean there is no chance of shared online space?,ikma,8,0,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1g9lpf/i_know_that_neither_of_the_nextgens_will_be/,"I'm worried that having the game on 4 consoles is going to fracture the community.  So, is there any chance that players who have Destiny for the 360 or PS3 will be able to play it with players who have it for the XB1 or PS4 respectively?  

I know it seems like a bit of a stretch, since the lack of backwards compatibility suggests that the different generations handle the game differently.  But since we don't know *how* they handle things differently, or how multiplayer games are hosted, I think that a multi-generational online environment could be possible.

I assume that the gameplay will function in the same way for both generations; the only real difference for the player should be things like graphics or loading times when you move between areas.  Graphics are likely rendered by your own box, and the system would have to deal with different loading times for *any* online multiplayer.  So, if the only thing that the server/host machine pays attention to is where everyone is and what they are doing, I don't see why you couldn't have 360/XB1 players (for example) playing together.

Do we have any information about this? Or does anyone know why it definitely wouldn't work?

I know that there will be no Microsoft/Playstation shared games; different companies, different servers, etc. I am asking if it is possible for people with XB1/360 to play together or people with PS3/4 to play together.

The thought of this is very exciting, but the recent announcement of the Xbox One has put a twist in this idea.

The Xbox One with be compatible with Microsoft's Azure cloud computing: a series of over 300000 load bearing servers. These servers could allow systems to distribute their workload through the network, which in turn could mean a higher player count during matchmaking.

Some sources have stated that online multiplayer matches will jump up to 64, or even 128 players, rather than the conventional 16 or 32. **So what does this mean for Destiny?**

Could you imagine? You'd be able to connect every single online friend into one strange world and still have room for others.

Well if Destiny is supposed to be this ten-year long deal, wouldn't that eventually put it in direct competition with Blizzard's new MMO?  

Blizzard and Activision are the same company, so they have common interests.  Now regardless of whether Destiny is a true MMO, it's likely to attract the same kind of crowd.  If released on the PC, it might be enough to damage whatever momentum they hope to gain with the new Blizzard MMO.

Please read before downvoting...,curtquarquesso,17,10,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1dypmr/anyone_else_have_difficulty_reading_deejs_weekly/,"Hiya community. This isn't so much about Destiny, as it is about the formatting of Bungie's (Deej's) recent posts, updates, and interviews. I know this is a weird topic, but it's something that's been frustrating me a bit. 

The darn things are nearly unreadable. There's just something about the typeface, size, line spacing, column width, and color that makes it REALLY difficult to read. Does anyone else get this? Don't get me wrong, the content is always fantastic, but the way it's presented is VERY difficult to digest. I've included some examples to help demonstrate my point. 

First, here are some examples of formats that were readable, and easy to digest. 

- [Halo Era Breaking In - Readable](http://halo.bungie.net/News/content.aspx?type=topnews&amp;cid=16261)

- [Halo Era Weekly Update - Readable](http://halo.bungie.net/News/content.aspx?type=topnews&amp;link=BWU_121809)

Now, some updates and posts that I find difficult to read.

- [Destiny Era Breaking In - Unreadable](http://www.bungie.net/7_Breaking-In---Rajeev-Nattam/en-us/News/News?aid=10485)


- [Destiny Era Update - Less readable](http://www.bungie.net/7_New-Beginnings/en-us/News/News?aid=10308)

- [Destiny Era Mail Sack Update - Unreadable](http://www.bungie.net/7_Mail-Sack-Break/en-us/News/News?aid=10432)

Does anyone else see this, or am I just crazy? Specifically, in the Halo Era Weekly Update, I like that the Q's and A's are well defined. In the Destiny updates, it's difficult to tell Q's from A's at a glance. In the Destiny era updates, the white font on gray background is the worst part. That, and the typeface. I have difficulty telling bold from standard.

If anyone here would tell me I'm not crazy, and somehow help me relay this information to Deej, I'd much appreciate it. 

Thanks. :)",,False,self,t5_2vq0w,False,,,True,t3_1dypmr,http://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1dypmr/anyone_else_have_difficulty_reading_deejs_weekly/,

&gt;""Now we’re saying, “How do we make sure that we can connect you, wherever you are and whatever your mood, to the Destiny universe?” That meant a big exploration of mobile. I think they showed you the user-testing lab next door. The very first thing that was tested in that lab was mobile. We’ve made some big investments there, because we think that, as awesome as stats and groups and messaging and all those things are, we just think there is so much more there. When we’re building a universe that has so many more stories and so much more depth, there are too many stories to tell just inside of that.""

I would like to know what this could mean on the mobile app front. I think they may be talking up the app to be more than will be, but I really don't know what IOS (and others) are capable of. I don't own a smart phone, and I'm not a programmer, so I want to know if it is feasible that an app could have a significant function in the gaming experience. I imagine it to have some messaging function, notifications, groups, stats, seeing if your friends are online, maybe you can customize your character, and I imagine they would have some type of in universe encyclopedia, but I don't see how anything else would be possible.

**Some questions:**

- Will we be actually fighting each other over territory and resources?  And if so, how will the outcome of those battles affect the factions?

-  Do these ""Faction Wars"" involve humans killing humans?  And if so, how does that fit into the lore?  I thought humans are on the brink of extinction.

-  What happens if one faction becomes too powerful?  Won't it ruin the game for the other factions?

-  Do ""Faction Wars"" pit guilds/clans against each other?  Or are there bigger factions that individual guilds/clans are part of?

-  Do these ""Faction Wars"" effect the single player campaign?

However, do you guys think there will be any way for players to compete against each other in tournaments and for money, like in Bungie's previous venture of Halo?

I understand that at this stage any talk of this kind of thing will be highly speculative, but Destiny looks like an FPS that could be played with full teams competing against each other. There may need to be community support for it and some kind of mode that allows players to play in a controlled and balanced way against each other.

I would most like to see some sort of mode like this *incorporated into the universe* rather than a lame side mode, like a planet where the local species host PvP sports or something else that ties it into the rest of the game.

Opinions? Don't want to see any eSports? Let me know.

Edit: So the PvP side is likely going to be called 'Faction Wars' and be its own aside mode. Thanks for this information!

Are there areas in the game that players will return to after their adventures that aren't combat zones where trade or just general hanging out and interacting will occur? Is that expressly what the city formed around the Traveler is for? 

Bungie has discussed personalized ships and they seem to represent a player's ""home base"" from which to launch off into new places to find trouble. But what about those players that just want to feel connected to the world but aren't itching for combat for a few minutes?

Most of the people here are on /r/halo as well, me included, and some of us liked Bungie before Halo. Specifically, I enjoyed Marathon. I love Halo and Marathon because they are fun and somewhat casual, at least less casual than RPG's, but there was something else that I couldn't pinpoint until recently. Bungie games are just...something else for some reason, and you want to learn more about them, as evident by the success of the Halo books and Halo lore. Then it hit me. Bungie games are mysterious. In Marathon, you only learn about the story line through consoles scattered throughout the game, and even then it's just a grasp of the story. In Halo, the story is pretty straightforward, but there is *so much room for postulation as to different things that aren't revealed directly.* For example, the Forerunners. The atmosphere in the games, particularly Halo, is one of awe and mystique (this is hugely due to music in my opinion). Since Destiny has had almost no information leaked and Bungie has been leading up to something on their twitter, I assume Destiny will be as mysterious, and as such as good, as the other Bungie games. I know this post is only weakly related to Destiny, but I wanted to put it here because you guys are Bungie fans as well as Destiny fans.

**TL;DR: If Bungie keeps the same formula for Destiny as they have for previous games, which I think they will, it will be amazing. This formula is one in which there is an atmosphere of awe and mystique, as well as good music and amazing structures.**

I personally want a game that can be casual or very competitive just like bungie did with halo 3. It had everything from custom games to very competitive playlists and I loved it. I also read that alot of people like exp based leveling systems like they had in reach but idk if it is just me but I hated the system in reach. I don't think you should be max level just because you play alot but maybe that is just me. I hope the pvp in this game is alot like halo 3 but maybe with some adjustments to the Mmr system because in halo 3 if you played too much ranked you could get stuck.

""There is not one development studio that I can recall that has the heart, passion, vigor, devotion, spirit and determination quite like yours, Bungie. You are the sole developer that I will buy just about any game from. When I plunge myself into the vast universes forged by your holy hands, I feel like I'm at home.

Ever since I first heard the iconic, heartwarming Opening Suite in the Halo: Combat Evolved main menu, I could feel your loving embrace wash over my unworthy form. With Halo came a plethora of lifelong memories, cherished every waking day within the depths of my very soul and well being. I have even met the best friend I have ever had in my existence online through Halo 2, and to top it all off, he lived only minutes from my residence. Halo 3 and Halo: Reach brought so many new and wondrous opportunity with the Forge, Theater Mode and wide variety of custom game options that our friends and I would go for several hours, or even days, relishing in the staggering sensations enveloping around us. Halo ushered a glorious ten years of my life that I would never trade for anything in this realm we call our universe, and you have chosen a fantastic studio, 343 Industries, to help continue the prosperity of your beloved child.

So what does all of this mean for Destiny? Why am I constantly dreaming of this new world in my sleep?

Destiny is driven by the interaction of people and the choices we all make that shape the way our experiences unfold before our very eyes. We will be traveling through the stars, meeting new and wonderful people along the way to hopefully build more lifelong friendships and alliances. Together, we will take on any adversary with efficacy, determination and vigor in our hearts. If we can stop seven Halos from wiping out all life in the Milky Way galaxy, who knows what we can accomplish in Destiny?

I want to play Destiny because I wish to form new relationships with other players in this vast universe that I will soon, too, be honored to call my home. I crave the idea of playing this masterpiece of a title with all of my old friends, making countless new ones along the way and strengthening the community that shaped us from the very beginning.

1. Characters. So From what I understand, you pick your race (human etc.) then you pick a character type such as Titan, warlock, or ninja (forgot what that one was called.) are there any other races and/or character types coming? Or are these the only options?
2. Weapon system. Is it like Borderlands? Borderlands system is *ok* because it works for Borderlands. But I don't see it working that well from what I've seen from Destiny. Like. In Borderlands. If you find a weapon at level 6. That gun is useless by level 12. You have to continually replace weapons. Personally I'm not a fan of that because some weapons I want to continue using through my levels. So could someone explain the system to me? 
3. Competitive. Is there a competitive mode? Like PvP/ 4v4 great competitive multiplayer like what we saw from Halo 2/3? Will it be ""Halo Style"" (Set weapons and maps. Balanced)? And would it work for MLG?
4. Is the game an MMO? This is a vague question. But one that should be answered. From what I understand the story evolves by what players do. But are we constantly playing with others in an open world environment?
I understand not all these questions can be answered yet. But I would appreciate answers to what you guys know. Thanks!

1. Can you customize your characters face/body shape, add scars, hair styles, eye/skin color, etc? Or is it a default avatar with just customized armor?
2. What does he mean when he says we'll have choices and it's all about choices? Does he mean that when i first start the game that i can automatically head to mars? Or maybe find a derelict ship? Or head to a remote base on pluto?
3. Related to the above question and yes it's definitely mass effect related. Do we have a say in the story whatsoever? Do we have any dialogue choices that affect the main story or just maybe your characters story? Be a roguish hunter with a shady past or be a titan with a number of honorable deeds. That kinda thing.
4. When it comes to your spaceship. Will there be space combat? How much customizing will it have? Can you take it anywhere(related to 1st question)?
5. This is my last question right now. How big are the public areas? Could i just sit around from a mile off and watch another fire team get decimated by a boss. Woah that brings up another question.
6. Will there be treasure chests of sorts randomly on the map? Or will it just be random drops from enemies? and if it has a chest system, will there be ones in public areas?

At the minute I have a reasonably new 360 (the Halo Reach edition), with a good collection of accessories, I won't be needing to replace controllers or headsets for a long time.

I'm thinking of sticking with the 360 for the first Destiny game, my console still runs fine and I would like to save some money, games consoles always drop in price significantly after the first few months so I would like to hold out for that if possible.

What concerns me is the massive difference in computing power when comparing the 360 to the next gen consoles, if I had a PS3 I wouldn't be so concerned but the 360 as a platform is already showing it's age, I'm concerned that Destiny may be a less enjoyable game on the 360.

What do you guys think? Will there be any major differences between each platform? Which version will you be buying?",,False,self,t5_2vq0w,False,,,True,t3_1js67a,http://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1js67a/platform_choice_looking_for_some_adviceopinions/,

Wouldn't it just suck if you absentmindedly walk out of a public space and when you run back in the guy you were talking to is gone because you were matched with a different session? My point is, if you return to a social space within, say, 10-15 minutes, you are automatically matched into the same session.

2. Alt gestures

The title says it all- alternate gestures swapped out for the 4 default ones. These could include

- ""I'm watching you"" http://media.photobucket.com/user/Minimanolo/media/2zhqzw2.gif.html?filters[term]=watching%20you%20gif&amp;filters[primary]=images&amp;filters[secondary]=videos&amp;sort=1&amp;o=0

- A high five- hold the gesture to stand in a high five pose, and if any other guardian gestures in front of you you two slap a high five. A prompt would appear of the players head the first 3-5 times you see someone doing a high five.

- fist pump http://media.photobucket.com/user/Bigsteve87/media/Gifs/tumblr_l2ng8v6kkj1qzfrzw-1.gif.html?filters[term]=fist%20pump%20gif&amp;filters[primary]=images&amp;filters[secondary]=videos&amp;sort=1&amp;o=11

- for lack of a better name, a gun gesture, which would vary based on what type of weapon you held- with a pistol you would twirl itaround a bit, with a shotgun you would cock it, and with just about anything else you shoulder it and nod a little bit.

- different dances

For the record, with all the rumors  about microtransactions flying around, these could be an EXCELLENT source of revenue.

3. A duel system.
As much as i hate to bring up other games, the on-the-spot duel system for borderlands would suit the atmosphere of destiny quite nicely. Even better would be if there was a formal system for putting loot on the line. At the very least provide us with 1v1 arenas.

4. A firing range.
A place to test your weapons. It would also be cool if you could lend your weapons to other players so they can feel you shiny new lmg for themselves- the catch being that the couldn't leave the range  until they gave it back, and it would automatically be transferred back to you if they disconnected.

These are all serious requests.
What do you think?

I know that most of us think that a healing spec for the Warlocks isn't really needed, and they haven't really given us a lot of information on the Titan yet, they could be a tank class, but that could just be me, if you say Titan I think heavy armor tank (if a tank is needed).  So far the Hunters seem pretty straight forward.

How many and what other classes do you think there will be? What would you like to see?

I for one think that there will be a straight combat spec (if it isn't already the Titan) possibly a Commando of sorts.  Lets say Hunters and Warlocks are light armor, and Titans are Heavy armor.  Then the Commando would be Medium armor with high DPS skills to invest in.  

I also think that there would be a support class, as in Buffs and DeBuffs, this could be the class that instead of straight healing magic, throws down med kits (Battlefield 3) to speed up the regen healing that we are already speculating about.  Possibly also Medium or Heavy armor?

I would love to hear you guys thoughts!
