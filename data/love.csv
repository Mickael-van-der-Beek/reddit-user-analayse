1366355097.0,157,self.love,1co0cb,The most beautiful true love story I have ever heard. This came from eavesdropping on 2 old men. I've never heard of such adoration and respect. I pray I can find something similar.,tywtly,177,20,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/1co0cb/the_most_beautiful_true_love_story_i_have_ever/,"I was in the coffee shop on my college campus studying when two older men came in and sat down on the other side of the room. One of the men started talking about his wife, and when he asked the other man about his wife, this is what was said.

""Man...I was 21 when I met her. I saw her from across the room and brother.....didn't nobody have to tell me who she was. I said 'there goes my wife', and the rest was history. That girl was something else, man. Every single day, I'd go and work for 12 hours and when I came home, she had dinner on the table waiting on me. After the kids were asleep, we were both so tired that we would go straight to bed just so we could hold each other. I was always content knowing that she was right there in my arms. I told her every night that as long as she was there, I was just fine. She was my queen, man. I told her that every day, she was the queen of my whole life. And my queen pushed me all the time to be the man I needed to be. She pushed me to seek God and follow Him and love Him with my whole heart, she pushed me to be a better daddy, and you can ask my little girls and they'll tell ya, we wouldn't be nowhere near where we are today if she didn't keep on making us better. Some folks just have a way of doing that, ya know? Some people just make you wanna be a better man. 

Well, one day, she started getting sick. I didn't worry too much at first, because everybody gets sick sometimes. But the doctors seemed to think it was something we should worry about. Well brother, they were right. She asked me if I would marry anyone else if she died. She worried about it. she couldn't imagine me being with another woman. I told her I could never have a second queen. But ya know what? She didn't believe me! That girl looked me in the eyes and said 'I know you better than that! You're the kind of man who needs a woman by his side. You couldn't be happy alone!'

I looked her straight back in those big brown eyes and I said 'sugar, I don't need no woman in my life, I need you. You're the only one for me.'

Well, after a year of fighting it, a lot had changed. There wasn't no more dinner on the table when I came home. Instead, I would work 12 hours a day, and I would come home. I would carry my wife out of bed and bring her to the table. I would cook dinner with her sitting there watching me, and we would just talk like nothing ever changed. Sometimes, we would sit and eat together and smile and just be happy that we could look at each other. On the bad days, I would feed her and she would cry and apologize, but I told her it was what I was there for. She was so sick, man. She was just so sick. She couldn't hardly do nothing. And she had to take medicine all the time, it was every 4 hours. So once we ate, I'd carry her back to bed and lay her down, and I would crawl in bed beside her and hold her just like I used to, and everything was ok. Just like I said before, it didn't matter what was going on, as long as I could hold her in my arms. But I could only lay with her for 4 hours at a time, because then I'd have to get up and bring her that medicine. But those 4 hours in between when I got to just be there beside her....man I wouldn't have traded that for nothing!""

There was a long silence, a profound peace which none of us eavesdroppers dared disturb with our poorly disguised sniffles

""But the body can only handle so much, ya know,"" the man continued. ""It took 2 years of her being sick as a dog before it got the best of her. I saw it coming, and so did she. We both knew she wasn't coming back from it. But it still felt like it came outta nowhere. I mean....one day she's there in my arms, and the next day she's gone. It killed me at first, but it didn't take too long before I realized that she really was better off. She didn't have to take no more medicine, she didn't have to eat no more of my nasty cooking, all she had to worry about now was praising the Lord! 

Ya know what still gets me though? Man, I don't know what to do about her stuff. I mean...I can't get rid of it. All her clothes are still in the closet, I got pictures of her everywhere, and her side of the bed is just how she left it. I wanna believe she's still here. My daughters tell me I should get it out of there and fix the place up, but I spent my life in that house with her. It's still our home, as far as I'm concerned.""

Silence again overtook the room. None of us had ever heard a man speak with such absolute respect and admiration. It was obvious that he had truly loved and adored that woman, and it wasn't changing any time soon.

The other old man broke the silence and said ""Man, that had to be so hard, though. I mean...taking care of her like that and having to do everything for her.""

A smile crept across the old man's face. His entire face lit up and he said,

""Brother, it was my privilege to be able to serve my queen for as long as I did.""",,False,,t5_2qhnh,False,,,True,t3_1co0cb,http://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/1co0cb/the_most_beautiful_true_love_story_i_have_ever/,

Have you ever missed someone so much that it hurt? And I’m not
talking normal hurt. I’m not talking about that feeling in your gut when
 you think about what you miss. That little sigh, you wish they were 
here. No. I’m talking about physical pain. Missing someone so badly 
that your stomach aches, and your legs cramp up, and you feel so 
frustrated that you could hit someone, and your head splits when you
 think about them and how far away they are from you. I’m talking 
about missing someone so much that one thought or memory of them
 can cause you to smile, weep, and vomit, all at the same time. I’m 
talking about when you miss them so much that you want to keep 
thinking of them, because you want to keep crying, because you’re
 afraid that if they’re gone too long you might forget, so you keep 
thinking of them so you miss them more. Because missing them makes
 you think of them. You’re so afraid that you may lose what you’re 
feeling. You know that the feelings you have are so true, so strong, so
 real, that they could burn through you like a fire; killing everything 
that’s left of you. Leaving a shell of who you used to be, before them.
 You know that it’s dangerous to miss them this much. It could hurt 
you, it could hurt them. And that’s the last thing you ever want to do,
 because hurting them would surely be the worst thing you can 
possibly imagine. But despite your fears, and the knowledge that the
 feelings you have could ruin you, you keep hold of them desperately.
 Clinging to them. 
	
You do this for one reason.
	
Because these feelings are all you have left of the person you miss. They’re gone, for whatever reason, for a long time, or possibly 
forever. It doesn’t matter which. But you miss everything about them,
 and you want to keep missing them. You want to keep hurting 
because it makes you remember them. 
	
And you do this because you know the moment you stop having
 these feelings; the moment you don’t think of them the moment you 
wake up, and before you go to sleep, and every time in between. The
moment that happens, you might forget them. You know if you stop 
hurting you might forget them. They might fade into your memory.
They could become just another person you used to know. Another
 blurry memory without definition. Their importance could fade into the
 background. You’re so afraid that you might forget the way they 
looked, and felt. You always have pictures, but pictures were never
 enough for me, at least. You still forget the way they felt when they
 smiled, the way their eyes lit up like stars when they laughed. The 
way their lips formed a smile, and the way their teeth looked when 
they grinned. You’ll forge the way they sounded. The way their laugh
 tasted, and the way it bubbled inside of you and made you so warm 
and so happy that you thought nothing could ever stop you from 
smiling. The way their hands felt in yours. The way their body felt
 against yours; the way it was so warm, so inviting. The way you felt
 like nothing could touch you as long as you were in their arms. You 
might forget how their body moved when they walked or dance, or ran, 
or sat. How their mouth formed each syllable they spoke. The way 
their lips felt against yours. The stupid quirks that they had that 
somehow drove you crazy, but made you smile bigger than you ever 
thought possible. 
	
What if you forgot it? What if you forgot all of it? What if one 
day you woke up and you couldn’t remember the way they made you 
feel? What could you do? They were gone, and you would have to 
move on. 
	
But moving on is the last thing on your mind. 
	
Because you love them. 
	
There has never been a truer feeling in your heart and soul than 
the feeling you have for this person. They literally mean the world to 
you. You can’t imagine life without them. And you can’t remember life 
before them. When you met them you knew that they were a knew 
person, but at the same time it was as if you had known them your 
entire life. You feel so utterly comfortable around them that you would 
tell them your deepest secrets, and your most private thoughts if they 
so desired to hear them. You could tell them and not have a second 
thought; because despite the fact that you just met them, you 
trusted them wholeheartedly. Traits that they possess that you would 
despise in another person are bearable, or even charming in them. You 
see the world in a whole new way because of them. The moment they 
stepped into your life the meaning of it changed. A new course was 
set for you that fateful moment, and you’ll never give it up. 
	
You love them. So you miss them. And you hurt for them. You 
would probably die for them. So this pain of longing isn’t so bad after 
all. Considering what you would do for them, if only they asked it of 
you. You let the pain take you over once in a while. You give into the 
tears and the pain. You cry for hours even, just at a thought of them. 
But it’s worth every second of hurt. Because for all the pain you 
endure for them, they’re worth it to you. The feeling that you get 
when you’re with them, even if it’s going to be years until that moment 
again, you wouldn’t give up for anything. Not for an instant. Because 
you know if you let yourself stop missing them you’ll forget. And 
forgetting them means forgetting the way they make you feel. It 
means forgetting love. And love is never something to give up on. 
	
Missing them means you remember them. And remembering them 
is all you have left. 
	
It may seem silly to cling to a feeling that hurts so much. After 
all, if you forgot and moved on wouldn’t you be happier? But then 
comes the fear. If you forget all that they were and all they made you 
feel how would you find it again?  You may meet someone who makes 
you happy, not as purely happy as the other, but happy. And you may 
compromise. What if you forget and take something less than you had? 
And then what if the one you had comes back, and causes you to 
remember. How could one endure? How could you leave the one you 
had settled for, how could you hurt them like that? But how could you 
go on after remembering what it was like with the one you really fell 
for?",,False,,t5_2qhnh,False,,,True,t3_12n1c1,http://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/12n1c1/have_you_ever_missed_someone_so_much_it_hurt/,

We've been apart way longer but all the mistletoe and lack of snuggling was really gettin' to me. Luckily, she drove two hours into the heart of rural Missouri to give me a lift to the airport in St. Louis yesterday.

We spend the morning with my family, subsisting on handholding and a little foot-on-foot action under the table. It's gross, but we're desperate. We finally break free and begin the long drive to the airport. She's tired so I gladly take the wheel of her mom's car. At one of the very last stoplights in town, we start kissing. *Hard.*

It was a supersensory combination, a spiritual experience akin to eating the world's most perfect green bean casserole, only the cream of mushroom soup has been replaced by a mix of psychedelic shrooms and leprechaun semen. Like legions of unicorn-riding gospel choirs were streaming into my ears in lockstep, like planets full of daffodils were exploding beneath my nostrils into celestial bouqets, like a million tiny, half-Asian polydactyl masseuses were gently working every ounce of tension out of my trembling frame, like seeing Christ himself appear before you. But he's wearing a tuxedo. Made of electric guitars. And bacon.

It was perfect. My bloodflow was instantly redirected southward. I closed my eyes, unable to see anything anyway due to the raging erection blocking my view (mine). It was at that exact moment when my foot slipped off the brake and we lurched into the 2008 Jeep Liberty just a few feet in front of us. It ruined the moment (but ended up not ruining our day!).

Now I'm paying over 500 bucks out of my own pocket for that Jeep's repairs, which is completely absurd given the fact that my slip-up resulted in two small scratches. However, in the interest of being a gentleman, I refuse to have my girlfriend's mother's insurance premiums go up. That is the lamest thing I've ever typed while bursting with pride, but I wanted to share it with you, Reddit.

I met this girl the first week of my freshman year at college. She was a friend of my room mate and she lived on the same floor as my in the dorm. We ended up getting to know each other more and more over the first couple of months of school and by winter time we had gotten extremely close. At the time I met her she was in a relationship with this dude for close to 3 years. He was nearly five years older than her and she would constantly talk to me about how she didn't love him anymore and was looking for a way out of the relationship. I had hung out with the two of them multiple times and though I have nothing against him, I knew that they weren't right for each other. I was also in a relationship with a HUGE bitch. She tried to control every aspect of my life and in general made me completely miserable. She is now my ex girlfriend and have not talked to her since. (But that's another story in and of its own). Anyway, at this point I've known her for about six months and I had fallen so deeply in love with her that she was the only thing I could ever think about. We would spend a lot of alone time together just talking. It was insane how much we shared in common. It was like our minds were one. Our philosophy on life was just so similar. I am a very laid back person and don't stress about much and she was the exact same way. We would always finish each other's sentences. Even when we would sit in silence, I never felt uncomfortable or awkward, we both knew that we were just having our own thoughts. And if one of us had a thought that we wanted to share, we didn't have a problem speaking our minds. This made every conversation we had a meaningful one because we would never just ""shoot the shit"". Although my feelings for her were so intense, I wouldn't dare reveal my secret to her. Her friendship was too valuable to me to put at risk and also we had decided that me her, and another friend of mine were going to share an apartment next year together, so I figured that my shot with her was at this point at a zero percent. She was everything and more that I was looking for in a girl; great sense of humor, laid back, insanely smart, down to earth, humble, adventerous and not to mention drop dead gorgeous. I distracted myself with other girls for a few months until finally towards the end of the school year she ended things with her boyfriend. Even at this point, I didn't make a move because I didn't want to mess anything up friendship wise/ living arrangements. Summer finally came and I went on a family vacation for the first two weeks of the break. While I was gone, she was the only thing I could think about. I couldn't wait to get back home just so I could see her.

Skip forward 2 weeks. The first night I get home and I hang out with her and a couple mutual friends. She gave me the biggest hug I have ever received the moment I saw her again. She told me multiple times how much she missed me while I was gone. You could't imagine how amazing that felt to hear. The next day we hang out again with the other friend we are going to be sharing an apartment with and find a place to live for the next coming school year in the city. The rest of the day we spent together just the two of us driving around and exploring nearby forest preserves. This day everything just seemed to be clicking. We had the best conversations that day and learned even more about each other. The more I learned about her the more I realized this was the girl that I not only wanted in my life, but NEEDED in my life. I had a mix CD in my car at the time with the song ""The Only Living Boy in New York"" on it by Simon and Garfunkel. As soon as it came on she exclaimed how it was her favorite song. Mine too but I also said that it has my favorite lyric of all time in it. ""I've got nothin' to do today but smile."" She freaked out and said that it was her favorite lyric too. I was getting goosebumps at all the things that were happening that day. It was like we were reading each others thoughts. We made it back to her place and watched the movie Garden State. A favorite of hers and mine. We ended up snuggling on the couch and before I knew it I was kissing the her and she was kissing me back. It was the most magical moment of my entire life.


That was three months ago. We've been dating ever since and now live together as well. Since then she told me that she had started to like me around the same time I had started to like her and that I was part of the reason she decided to end it with her now ex-boyfriend. Damn that felt good to hear. 

Not two weeks after we started dating, I told her that I was in love with her. She felt the same. 

This girl makes me feel alive. She makes me feel like life is worth living and every day I get to wake up next to the my favorite person in the world. 

Everyone, Love is real. Don't stop searching because trust me it is real and when you find it, you hold on to it with everything you have. If the person you are dating makes you miserable, I promise you, you don't love them. When you find the person your meant to be with, everyday feels like the happiest day of your life. Don't settle when you can have so much more and don't cut yourself short.

Be patient with the one you love and the universe will let everything fall into place. 

I don't care if people up vote or down vote this. I just needed to share my story. I have found my soul's counterpart and I am truly happy. 

TL;DR: I have found the love of my life and have never been happier.",,False,,t5_2qhnh,1348085872.0,,,True,t3_105d9k,http://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/105d9k/love_is_real/,

(They dated 7 months. Girl has a son who's father left when he was born. Guy decides to take a chance and finds the love of this life. Girl gets scared they are drifting apart so breaks it off. Guy is heart broken but texts her a few months after the break up.)

""Baby... remember when we called each other that? How about the first night we met? You beat me at mini golf. Do you remember our late night texting about being each other's world, revolving around [your son]? How about dinner at outback talking about houses and our future? If you're scared of getting hurt... I promise you, I won't. Relationships have ups and downs, but that's why relationships take work. In the end... you and [your son] are all that matter to me, family. I have every text, every message sent saved, and reading about our passionate love makes me melt inside. The plans with marriage. I'd give anything to make that happen, to be with you and to be a father figure for [your son]. It doesn't matter what others think, my brothers or parents... you matter, [your son] matters. When I hear your voice... I get butterflies, when I see your eyes or smile... my breath is taken away. I can't promise you we will be rich, that we won't have our fights, but what I can promise you is that I will always be dedicated to you, I will always give my best for you, I will always be faithful to you, I will always be honest with you, and I will always love you [ex gf]. I want to create memories with you and [your son], a family. Days at the lake, nights by a fire, snowmen in the winter, zoo visits, park trips, soccer games, family game nights... everything! Most of all... if you are even still reading this... I want to love you with endless passion, I want to share life with you, and make you happy. You are my best friend [ex gf]. Give me another shot... move past the fear of getting hurt because I never intend to let you down. I'll always support you, in your best and worst of times. If you have gotten this far and aren't pissed or angry at me, at least respect me and reply. If it's time you need, then say it. If you're scared, say it. We can take it slow, or dive right in. I'm pouring my heart out to you. This is my letter to you that I never could write.

We have been together for many years,she is like my wife since we even live together. A couple of months ago I had a fatal car accident for I was briefly in a coma and later on was unable to fully walk correctly. Since I am a soccer player this frustrated me and I eventually stopped eating well,stopped doing the things I normally did and I stopped taking care of myself,period. I didn't want to live due to the pain constantly hitting my body. I also stopped caring about her. 

She remained there consistent. Even if our love life was over,she was there,constantly cheering me on. I didn't care.

One night she got up and forced me to walk in the middle of the night while I was screaming at her because I thought I couldn't do it. She kept on pushing me. Instead of giving up like I did, she would wake me up every morning to exercise my legs. She missed work to take care of me. She constantly reminded me what a great athlete I am. She would take me to the field and play soccer with me,even if I couldn't walk and she didn't know how to play soccer.

She step by step gave me my life back. As I am writing this she is besides me sleeping and I am grateful I get to wake up next to such a wonderful human being,my love...my life. Instead of giving up and leaving me,she stayed and saved my life. And I am thankful,always will be. I will always love her.

I'm NOT sarah.' it makes me smile. just because sarah fucked up my emotions it doesnt mean i gotten worry about the girl putting me back together.

she stands a foot shorter than me (im slightly tall) and when she looks up into my eyes and smiles, i just want to burst out the feeling in my chest and do something.

so today chilling in Manhattan: we're walking and talking. i was hinting that'd id want a relationship. and she said ' any girl would be stupid enough not to realize how adorable and fucking sweet you are.' and i just stopped her and made her look at me. then i kissed her. holy fuck. i grew balls all of a sudden. it was a great feeling. we're kinda dating now. i love it. im in love.

I've known since the day I met her that she would one day be my wife. Getting the ring took longer than I wanted, and this morning it finally came. In all honesty she'd been expecting me to propose, but not today since I worked all night. But I got off work early and got ready and picked her up. I never really wanted to do something huge and profound to propose, and I knew that's not really what she'd want either, so here's what I did:

We went to a little park in my town, where I first told her I love her. She pretty much already knew what was up. We sat down on a bench and I told her I had a present. Instead of giving her the ring, I gave her a little book called *Consider Love*, by Sandra Boynton. Really cute book. Then I said I had another present, and I gave her a mix CD I made earlier. On it was written ""Will you marry me?"" and as she looked at it I got down on my knee and pulled out the ring. I asked her if she wanted another present, she smiled and said yes, and I popped the question. 

After looking at this sub-reddit and being saddened by the amount of unrequited-love stories and break-up stories, I figured a happy tale of success might warm some reddit hearts.
TL;DR - tonight I asked my girlfriend to marry me, she said yes, and I'm so happy I had to post it.",,False,,t5_2qhnh,False,,,True,t3_grwjn,http://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/grwjn/want_a_happy_story_instead_of_a_sad_one/,

i tried to ignore the feelings that i had for him, but they kept coming up, no matter how far away i pushed them. but last night i came to a few amazing realizations. (amazing, for me).

1. you can never know exactly what someone else feels, unless you're willing to put yourself out there and PRAY that they trust you enough to be honest about the way they feel. 

2. you can never change someone else, no matter how much you want to. even if you think that he's scared, or that he's waiting for the right moment, you cannot force him to come to grips with himself. that is, if there's even something for him to come to grips with. 

and FINALLY 
3. you can't be angry at someone for not loving you the way you love them. people are just people. boys are boys and girls are girls, and no matter what they do to you, there's no excuse for disrespecting someone else. especially if you say you love them. 


TL;DR-
we shouldnt be douchebags, even if the person we love is a douchebag. because that just makes a world of douchebags.

1333700936.0,28,self.love,rw1ic,A letter to you,,31,3,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/rw1ic/a_letter_to_you/,"Dear  You,

How have you been?

It’s been a while since we talked last so I’ll try not to talk to fast.

It’s been hard for me not having you around. I keep asking myself why I broke up with you and I can’t come up with a definite answer. Isn’t that funny? I just couldn’t be with you anymore. Something about our relationship didn’t seem right. I can’t tell you what it is because no matter how much I try to pin it down I don’t know what it is, but I know that something between us doesn’t quite work out. There’s this one quote that I found a while ago that sums up how I feel right now.

“He was a major part of your life; of course you’ll miss him; it’s perfectly normal. It’s like getting a tooth pulled out; after the dentist pulls it, you’re relieved. But how many times do you run your tongue over the spot where it once was? Probably a hundred times a day. Just because it was hurting you, doesn’t mean you don’t notice it. It leaves a gap, and sometimes you see yourself missing it terribly. It’s going to take a while, but it always takes some time. Should you have kept the tooth? No, because it was causing you pain. Pulling the tooth was the right decision, but it’s still going to hurt.”

This is how I feel about us. At one point you felt so right in my life. You were a tooth to me. You were part of me that helped me get through my day, chewing my food and what not, but at some point you came loose. When a tooth comes loose there really is only one thing to do. Pull it out. But as the days passed where you were out of my life it felt like a missing tooth. There was gap in my life that you once filled. So I did the only sensible thing and tried to put you back in my life. The problem with that is that, when you try to put a tooth you pulled out back in, it’ll stay for a little, but then fall out again because in the end it’s no longer part of you.  And that’s what I tried to do. Put you back in. That putting the tooth I pulled out back in would put things back to normal, but the truth is it doesn’t. Once you pull a tooth out, it’s no longer part of the body, and it stops growing. 

I miss you so much you have no idea. I wake up day after day and you’re the first thing that comes to mind, and with the thought of you comes the pain of not having you around. I dream constantly about you too. In one of my dreams you told me you were pregnant and I was mind fucked because I never remembered us having sex, but apparently we did. All I did was hold you and tell you I’d be there for you. When I woke up from that one I couldn’t get out of bed for a while. 

But in the end it’s called a break up because it’s broken, and I haven’t seen that until now. I’ve been so naïve and short sighted in thinking that if we’re together we’ll both be happy to see that no matter how much I try to fix something as broken as us, I can’t. I pulled you out of my life, so I should have stayed out of yours. For that I’m sorry. I really am.

I hope that if this letter ever gets to you, that you know it’s from the heart.

For the past two years you’ve helped me through so many hard times and through so many good ones. You’ll always be a part of me that I’ll never forget. I’m sorry that I’ve tried to put you back in to my life so many times. I should’ve seen that it would just end in heartbreak, but I only saw that something was missing instead of seeing that it’s gone for a reason. I’m sorry that I convinced you to come back thinking that everything would work out each time, but I see now how bad I am for you. 

I hope that one day you’ll say hi to me and that we can talk about how we’ve been and that I can clear up anything I’ve confused you about. 

Life goes on and we have to go along with it. That’s something that I’m still trying to do with us. I hope that the next guy that steals your heart will be just as amazing as I am and you can be assured that the next girl to steal mine will be just as amazing as you, and someday we can argue about whose is better. 

You have given me love. You showed me how to be so happy that I cried tears of joy; something only you did for me. It’s been said that the greatest kind of love is the one that awakens your soul and makes you reach for more. It plants a fire in your heart and gives you peace in mind. You’ll always be the girl that did that for me, and I hope that, at some point, I did that for you. Thank you for everything. Every day I thank whoever runs this universe that you were chose to be my first love and I was chosen to be loved by you. 

Thank you.

Sincerely, 

Me

I met him as a premedical student while we were in college. I was recently elected to the executive board of your run-of-the-mill student group to do the marketing BS that goes along with it. He was returning to be an exec for his second year. I walked into the room, we locked eyes, and the sound of brakes screeching rattled around in my skull. 

After that first meeting, he waited for me and we ended up talking for an hour before dragging ourselves to our respective A.M. classes. And, jesus, did we hit it off. I tried to quell my primal urges......which worked for 4 weeks or so. Then, he invited me out.

A couple of hours of surfing turned into a night at a local bar. And, many laughs, a few dances, and several drinks later, we ended up back at my place. That night would kick off 9 months of the steamiest (and most fulfilling) friends-with-benefits situation I had ever even heard about. 

We would meet for parking lot rendezvous in the middle of the day to tear each other's clothes off, and at night he would make me dinner and we'd share a six pack and laugh at obscure sketch comedy. He was the only one I trusted to cry in front of when a family member fell very ill, and I was more myself around him than anyone else. I fell for him so hard, but was afraid to tamper with the sanctity of the friends-with-bennies unstated agreement (you know the one), so I remained silent. Little did I know, he was sworn to secrecy for the exact same reasons. 

After months of choking down my desires and desperately searching for any sign of reciprocity, I met someone. He was sweet, innocent, and--most importantly--spoke with conviction about how he felt. Assuming that my ""friend"" was fine with remaining as such, I made it official with the new man. 

Only a couple of days after the facebook status went active, heralding the official relationship, I received a long heart-wrenching email from the friend. He said that he had been in love with me but afraid to express it for fear of scaring me away, and that if he had known that I would be receptive to having a romantic connection, he would have been the first to jump in line. 

I was crushed. I sat on my floor and cried. And, without thinking it through, drove an hour to his house for what I can only describe now as a pathetic attempt at gaining clarity. He greeted me with a tender smile, we sat on the cliffs of the beach, drank bourbon, and let all of the pent up, emotional angst come out. At sunset, when I couldn't take it anymore, I kissed him. A deep, meaningful one with classy amounts of tongue. But...it was a kiss goodbye. 

I know...I know... You're thinking, ""Really? REALLY?! What do you mean  'goodbye'?! Are you stupid?"" 

Yeah...yeah I am. 

I suppose I was shy around him. How could I trust that he'd be open with me from now on, especially after having another young man pour his heart out to me so readily? Yep...not airtight logic, that's for sure.

Anyway, we talked a few more times--saying we'd remain friends--and eventually lost contact for two years. Since then, we'd both graduated from college, I'd moved to the opposite coast, and we were both in relationships. 

(Here's the good part!)

One day I was reflecting on my impending medical school applications. I remembered all of the folks I started the journey with and was curious as to who had made it through. After going through my phone, I stumbled upon his number and smiled. And, after two years, I gave him a call. 

The phone rang forever, but when he picked it up, I could hear him smiling. The first conversation was cut short by an evening class of mine, but BANG instant chemistry.

We promised to talk again, and we did. For four hours. And again. And again. It became readily apparent to us both that we had been harboring latent love for the two years of silence. We finally let all of our baggage from our jaded end come to the surface and were finally honest. About everything. And have since maintained that tradition. Interestingly enough, we also found out that both of our relationships were going downhill. ""Wouldn't it be strange if we were both single at the same time?""  .................Yes. Yes, it would. 

Well, it happened. And we met at the airport for the first time in 2 and a half years with smiles, and smooches, and sweet embracing. It was a love shit show. 

To make a long story longer, we're now dating. And I've never felt so satisfied in my life. Being together--finally--is so easy. It fits. Perfectly. And, it is such a long time coming. My folks love him, I love him, and it's disgustingly, absurdly amazing. He's moving out here to live with me prior to the start of his medical school (yes, he got in! yay!) so that we can make a good go at things. Depending upon how it goes, my own medical school location will probably be dictated on, within reason, his whereabouts. 

**TLDR: Those outrageously annoying sayings, ""If it's meant to be, you'll find each other again"" may actually be true. Girl meets boy. Girl loses boy. Boy and girl reunite after two years of silence to enact Happily Ever After. But, heed my warning: don't let time pass wondering whether or not you should be honest with the person you care about. 99.9% of folks don't get a second chance.**",,False,,t5_2qhnh,True,,,True,t3_nvnfx,http://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/nvnfx/those_of_you_looking_read_a_mushy_story/,

We both showed up in flip flops, shorts and without safety goggles. To get into lab you had to have pants, closed toed shoes, and those terrible safety goggles. Well, we were the only two students out of a 100+ class without the proper attire, so we were sent back to our dorms to get our things. We ended up walking back together, and coincidentally lived on the same floor of the same dorm building. Once we collected our proper materials, we headed back to the lab and, once again another coincidence. Both our last names started with S and so we became lab partners. The two most unprepared students became lab partners. Great. That turned out not to be such a bad thing. We got close super fast. we studied together alot and over time things just connected. I still remover when I realized I was starting to like this boy. My sweat pants in lab turned to yoga pants.  My hair just alittle more neater than the regular messy braid. One night of studying particularly stands out. My roommate and I were studying in the commons area when I asked him to come out and study chemistry with me. Obviously chemistry wasn’t studied, and we spent the next few hours talking about all our interests. They were fightenly similar. There was no way that this handsome kid liked broadway plays, traveling the world, geeking out to lord of the rings, or playing music? For sure he was just pulling my strings, just pretending to be interested in all the same things as me. Turns out, we really were just that similar. The first night when our feelings were revealed, I knew wed eventually end up together. He invited me over for a LOST marathon after a strenuous week of exams. We started off just slouching on his bed, obviously exhausted from studying and the mental warfare that is exam week. He began lying on the bed, and so i casually leaned into him. before i knew what was happening my head was on his chest and he had his arm around my waist. (he even planted tiny kisses on my head thinking i wouldn't notice. Believe me, i noticed). We laid together for hours, almost ""watching"" an entire season without even paying attention to the screen. We talked about everything and anything that came to mind. Thats my favorite thing about him, things are never boring, we can talk about anything. We often even debate and share our different opinions  on topics, which is great to find out more about eachother. So back to the story, there was obviously some unspoken tension. As i got up to leave he asked ""would i be break the rules if..."" and i kissed him before he could finish his sentence (""would i be breaking the rules if i kissed you"" is what he meant to say). you see, i was in a crumbling relationship, and he had just broken up with his high school sweetheart. I dont think we planned on anything happening, it just all fell into place. were we breaking rules? definitely not. kissing someone had never felt so right. I cant remember being as excited about anything than that kiss. It was hard leaving his room after that, but I managed to run to my twin sisters room to gush about this amazing boy. Thinking back on that night it feels like a fairy tail. I consider it one of the best nights of my life.

I write this note because I am in love with one of the most amazing girls in this world. Yet she does not love me back. I write because I love her so much that it drives me insane and I have no other emotional outlet.

I long to be with her. Just being near her makes my heart do backflips. It makes me feel....so alive. More alive than I could ever imagine. We could be just sitting in an empty closet together and we wouldn't have to do or say a single thing. And I would just melt in every second of perfect bliss. Simply because she's just in the room.

I long to hold her in my arms and feel her body so close to mine. Her heart beating against my chest while I fight the urge to never let her go. Her beautiful eyes gazing into mine as I kiss her gently. In my mind that would make me the luckiest man to ever live.

I dream of the day where I can hold her in my arms and call her mine. And be there for her. All the time. Not because I have to, but because it's all I ever want to do.  

But I'm an idiot. I can't spend time with her without later regretting doing or not doing certain things. I can never seem to give her the most amazing time that I know I'm capable of giving her. I cannot just open up and be myself. My love for her gets in the way of my ability to show her how great we would be together. And that tears me apart. It rips me to shreds. It eats away at my mind day and night. And that just makes me love her even more. It's torturous that I cannot be with the love of my life.

She is my weakness. She confuses me and then I confuse myself even more by thinking about it too much. I hate not knowing how she feels about me.

But most importantly, I wish she could read this. I wish I could just tell her how I really feel and not have to worry about creeping her out or overwhelming her. I wish she could just read every last word and know that they're REAL. That they are as real as she makes me feel alive. That there is somebody out there who wants to be with her more than anything. Ever.

What we have is a business relationship filled with friendly and often very personal conversations.

1346750843.0,23,self.love,zbtwi,The story about the girl I love,unholyvanny,26,3,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/zbtwi/the_story_about_the_girl_i_love/,"It was Sophomore year in highschool, my great grandfather had passed away, my parents lost their business, and our house became foreclosed. I fell into the wrong group of kids, trying to cope with the extreme amount of stress and depression I was dealing with. I went from a sweet kid who wanted to become everyone's friend to a hoodlum, smoking, listening to metal, atheist, and hated the world, until she came along.

There was something about her, she made me happy, one of the only times I could ever be happy during those times. She would make me laugh and smile, and she started bringing the old me back out. It was wonderful, I loved her, but i was too nervous to ask her out. Soon she was taken from me, I had waited too long, someone else had asked her out and she hardly ever saw me again.

I had dropped harder than ever before, my heart broken, depression kicking in, I didn't want to live anymore. Nothing was ever going right, things only got worse, and I didn't want to live in it anymore. I was walking along a bridge, and thought about jumping off, when I received a text message, it was from her, the first time I had talked to her in a half a year, and she had said that she missed me, and that she had broken up with her boyfriend. Receiving that text made me change my mind, I walked away from the bridge, and continued to talk to her for the rest of the night.

At the end of the night, we were talking about movies, the new toy story, and how it's ending around the same time we are graduating/ getting close to graduating. She said that every good movie has to end, and she was watching one right then, she said that it was about a young girl texting this amazing, sweet boy, but was getting so tired she couldnt focus any more.

This event made me man up and finally ask her out, I am a computer person, and she speaks a little French (now is minoring in French in college) so I decide to make a program that would tell of a story, and at the end of the story, it would open a file hidden on the jump drive containing the story of a teddy beat holding a heart, and in French, it said ""Kira, will you go out with me?"" i had given it to her on a Friday, and was nervously awaiting a reply, on Sunday, I finally got a reply saying that she would love to go out with me, making me the happiest guy in the world.

We went to the movies, and went to dinner afterward, she has diabetes, and she is allergic to wheat, so her choices for food are extremely limited, but that was no worry to me, I would learn to deal with anything for her. It was the best night of my life, going on a date with the girl I've loves for a year and a half now, nothing could get better.

It wasn't a week later that I decided to ask her if we could be Facebook official, when she told me the bad news... She said that she thought we were going out as just friends. It crushed me, I didn't know what to do or say, I had payed for the entire night out, but it was worth it at the end of the night because I loved her, and I would have done anything for her, and she thought it was just as friends... I was not myself since that point.

A year and a half later, I still love her, she's still the girl that saved me from dying, and saved me from being a highschool drop out, smoking and drinking and partying. I graduated highschool, and planned on moving to Oregon for college a week later. 

At my going away party, she came, and bringing a chocolate rose for me. The night progressed, eventually her and I ended up kissing, the best thing that has ever happened in my life. She had flashed me that same night, but the kiss was the most important event, nothing else mattered but that. I wanted her to come with me, but she had college there, and her family, so we went our separate ways.

Moving to Oregon was achieved through the use of cars, and many nights of staying in hotels, one night in the hotel, I decided to check Facebook when I see it, the worst thing that I had ever seen, it said ""Kira is in a relationship to John Doe (not actual name)"" my heart stopped beating, I couldn't breath, I couldn't think, I couldn't do anything. I was a statue, frozen in time and space. Not 3 days since I left, and she is in a relationship with some guy, I talk to her about him, and she tells me about how he's sweet, and really shy, and how it took a lot for him to ask her out, it sounded like he had the exact same personality as me. The girl i love, taken by a guy who is exactly like me. My heart shattered into a million pieces.

After reaching Oregon, I placed the chocolate rose she gave me on my desk, in the hand of a dragon statue, I see it every day when I sit at my computer, and I think of her, and how much I love her, she means everything to me, and even though she is with another guy, she's happy, and that's all that matters to me.

If that isn't love, than I don't know what is, thank you for taking your time to read the story of my crappy, but true love story, not every love story ends happily, but no one knows what happens in the future, and maybe something good would finally happen in my life :)",,False,,t5_2qhnh,False,,,True,t3_zbtwi,http://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/zbtwi/the_story_about_the_girl_i_love/,

It was nothing to me, but a lie that I'd been searching and waiting, and hoping for my entire life. It was basically the same thing as Santa Clause, just something people tell you about to keep your hope up, and to give you purpose, but doesn't actually exist. I had accepted the fact that I was love-less, and since it was not real in my eyes, that's how it was going to stay and I was okay with that. 
I went months, happily living my life without a care in the world about finding my love, soul mate, whatever you want to call it. As lonely as it was, I was determined to be happy. Determined to not care about the opposite sex, and to stay away from relationships and all the hurt that came along with them.
One night, a friend dragged me out of my comfortable bed, and made me go to a party with them. I had an interview in the morning, and didn't want to be out late, so I agree'd as long as we only stayed for a few hours I'd go. 
So we get there, and the first person I see, the very first person I notice at all, before I even walk through the door completely, was the one I'd been searching for. I couldn't help but stare, and almost instantly was caught. They looked right back at me, and I don't know if it was just me, but there was something there right from that first glance. We then proceeded to introduce ourselves, and spend the entire night hanging out. They didn't mind that I decided to not drink and be the DD of the night, and I didn't care that they were getting drunk as a skunk with all our friends. We followed each other around like lost puppies all night long. Man was that an interesting night. Fights broke out, I almost got smashed in the head with a bottle. Windows broken, beer pored all over peoples heads... Let's just say people get really fucking rowdy. Sadly, around six AM, I had to pry myself away and go home to get some sleep for my interview.
The next day I added them on facebook, and waited to see if they'd say something to me. I waited for almost a week for any little conversation started to pop up. I didn't know what was wrong with me, sitting by a computer all day, every day for a week, just waiting. Then finally I gathered up the balls to message them. At first their responses came very slowly, and seemed uninterested, but as a little time went on, they started starting the conversations, and trying to make plans. We'd hang out every once in a while, and this went on for about a month before we spent our first night together. They knew damn well I had feelings for them, so saying yes to crashing at my place was sort of me trying to see if they felt the same.
we cuddled all night, as gay as it might be, and we kissed, and it was absolutely breathe taking. We did nothing more then hold each other, play-wrestle, and laugh. It was such a perfect night. 
The next day was the big day. We started dating, and six months later I'm sitting here writing about it, because that was the best month and half of my life. I'd taught myself to not believe in love, convinced myself I had all I needed. Never once would I have believed you if you were to tell me that I'd fall in love just by one glance. Love at first sight was a myth. Things did not happen that way, until that night. The night I almost missed because of a stupid interview. The night I was close to skipping out on because I was all comfy-cozy in my bed when asked to go. The night that changed my entire outlook on the world. I'm here now, with the person I belong with, happy, and completely content with life. Who would have known one awful party could be looked at in such a wonderful way, all because of one particular person. That person, that was part of a gender that I'd hated. I'd refused to give the time of day. 
I sometimes wonder if I'd still be like how I was, today, if I had not met that person. But it almost pains me to think about a time where they were not in my life.

So. I'll start.

The person I have in mind is probably one of the kindest, most considerate person I have ever met, to the point where it's sometimes a weakness. It's pretty easy to take advantage of it, and I admit that even I did. But his kindness really affected me, and I've really wanted to change my ways to become a better person and be kinder to people, too. He's also very sincere and honest; everything he says, I can tell he really means it. And he has this childlike nature at times; he's not afraid to act a little goofy and have a little fun, and it's also a little embarassing but never fails to make people smile. Smiles.. His smiles, I love his smiles. My favourite ones are the ones that he makes for me when he notices me watching him play guitar in a room among our other friends, the ones that no one else notices and makes me feel like in that moment, there is only this connection.

I didn't know who she was though until 7th grade, when we had biology together. I never talked to her at that point and was undecided on what I thought about her. I couldn't tell if I just thought she was hot or something else. Next year comes and I happen to have two classes with her, science and Spanish. I never really talked to her, but about halfway through the year I started to realize how much I did like her, I ended up spending most of my time thinking about her. Of course I had never said a word to her. But I had become pretty good friends with some people who talked to her, so I got her number from my friend and the night before the last day of school I typed up this really long heartfelt message telling her exactly how I felt about her (I will do pretty much anything behind anonymity). During 7th grade and the beginning of 8th grade she had been dating this kid who had always picked on me in 4th and 5th grade, (but no bad feelings against him anymore) and after they broke up she started dating someone else. I guess you can say I got pretty lucky because he ended up going to a different high school than us. I had also never told any of my friends how I felt about her, because nobody can be trusted. But anyways about that message, soon after I sent it she replied asking who this was and that it was kind of creepy and that her boyfriend was getting angry (little did I know that someone else had done something similar to this multiple times to her in the past). I wasn't really worried about it though. It took her about 30 minutes to find out who it was and needless to say the next day was the most awkward day of my life. But she must have told a whole lot of people about what had happened because the next day my friend came to me and said, ""So I heard you like (Insert name here)."", I replied yea, while on the inside my whole world collapsed on itself. The whole summer past filled with me not being able to get her out of my head, and then during the last 2 weeks of summer, I saw on Facebook that her relationship status changed to single. This is it I thought, my chance. This year I have Spanish and orchestra class with her, and during the first 2 weeks in Spanish I was sat right next to her. Neither of us said a word to each other, just awkwardly shared glances. about 4 weeks into the school year the awkwardness had faded, and then she started going out with what most girls would probably consider a dream guy, he was tall, strong, athletic, and most of all he was confident. I thought for sure that my chances were ruined now, because most of her relationships had lasted at least a couple of months. That relationship ended pretty quickly though only 2 weeks, and I'm 100% sure that he got into her pants at least once in those two weeks. Now at this point sometimes she would ask me a question about something in Spanish, and every time she did I would just be so love struck that I would never know what she was asking, I could remember every time she had talked to me this year so far. Now while in Spanish class we sometimes talk, in orchestra we both play violin, and are both in the first violin section. I am easily the best in the orchestra, and was first stand, she was third stand. I decided to try and impress her with how nice I am by getting her music folder along with mine, we still didn't talk very often, but occasionally I would be the only one playing the music and I could feel her glare on me. Then our orchestra director decided to switch up the seating, and we get placed at the same stand. I am so excited I can barely think. We sit down together, and she says hi to me, on the inside I just blew up from excitement, but on the outside I managed to keep my cool, and replied with a simple hey. We shared a little bit of conversation and she complimented me on my playing, I complimented her back and by that time the class was over. The next day in orchestra the seats were back to the way they used to be. I was disappointed. But over the next couple of weeks she had started calling me a show off in orchestra, and she no longer referred to me by my name, instead by show off. I really didn't know what to say back, because every time she talked to me I would get lost in her eyes and become unable to think clearly. Every time she talked to me my heart would race and I would become light headed. We didn't really talk that much besides when she called me a show off. But now we start to approach now, about two weeks ago. By now she had stopped calling me show off and started calling me perfectionist, which quickly changed to perfect. Then in the middle of orchestra class while the cellos were practicing a part in the music she stood up, called my name and said, exactly what she had said in a dream I had a couple nights ago ""When are you going to ask me out?"" I was in total shock, and not knowing if I had heard her correctly replied back to her ""What?” Then she mouthed the words ""I love you"" I just said back ""Okay"", thinking maybe she was pulling a prank on me, and turned back around and tried to act as if nothing had happened. I turned around one more time because my other friend had called my name, and I saw her staring at me with the biggest smile I had ever seen. I was utterly confused. I really wanted to talk her now but she was always with her popular friends, who most thought I was still as weird as I was in elementary school. About a week later comes our concert, and about an hour before it starts I am in the orchestra room jamming with a few of my friends she comes up to me and says, ""Stop being so perfect!"" like she did normally. I got lost in her eyes and messed up my playing, so I said to her ""There, now you've heard me mess up."" After the concert as we are walking back to the orchestra room she walks alongside me and says, ""(My name) the perfectionist, of course you didn't mess up during the whole concert."" My heart started pounding, but I tried to keep as casual conversation as I could. Then yesterday as I was leaving the school I walked past her and she said to me ""See you later perfect."" I wish I had a better response than ""See you later."" I still can't stop thinking about her though, and I keep fantasizing about maybe if she does like me, then what would happen if we started going out. I’m just really confused right now. What should I do? She's waaay out of my league, I don't even understand.

We both were in long term relationships when we met. We were lab partners in organic chemistry, worked together as RA's and at the front desk at the mailroom on-campus. We bantered and joked and walked up from class together. We spent 6 hours a week or so at the least between class, work and lab together and we were and are great friends.

A few weeks ago, I went to look at an apartment for the summer. My boyfriend couldn't go so my lab partner went with me. He jokingly suggested we pretend to be a couple when we went to check out the house and I took him to dinner afterwards as a thank you. We didn't know then but that's when it all started. Of course we had fun at dinner because we were friends, and that was all. 

Then, we played with an Ouija board, just the two of us, again just as friends out of curiosity. Only, after we'd fully freaked each other out, he said ""you know, now would be the perfect time to make a move if we liked each other."" But I still didn't see him that way, and I thought it was probably the adrenaline tricking me into liking him a little more than usual. He came to a party that my [now ex] boyfriend and I were throwing for St. Patrick's Day and we were attached all night, couldn't stop talking. Drunk gossiping about friends and past relationships, that's the night that we actually started to fall in love but problem, I have a boyfriend who I thought that I loved very much. 

I chose to break up with my boyfriend because of some brewing issues with jealousy and because we really had nothing in common and usually sat around and did nothing and said nothing whenever we were together. My friend helped me through everything, supporting me every step of the way, even when the choices weren't to his benefit. All the while, we were learning more and more that we were perfect for each other. Who knew that there was someone out there who liked all the same music, and movies, and foods as I did. Someone who liked to have the same kind of intellectual conversations as me. Someone who'd been looking for the same thing I'd been looking for all along.

I had never looked into someones eyes and seen what I see in his. Now that we've been seeing each other, I'm happier than ever. We couldn't have rushed in any faster but the problem is that we had no choice. I see nothing that I could dislike about him. We drive down the road listening to Queen and making plans to run away to Mexico together. We lay in bed and talk about biology research together and we spontaneously dance under the stars. Talking to him is like talking to myself. Kissing him is like kissing myself.

I keep telling myself that it can't be fate, or love so quickly and so randomly but the more we learn about each other, the more I am sure that there's no way this could've happened on accident. What are the odds that we'd both love grape nuts with bananas or peanut butter and apples or that we'd both be addicted to the same kind of gum. We like to snuggle in the same specific position and we both want to retire and teach high school. We want the same number of kids, the same number of wedding guests, and being with him makes me better than myself. I've never felt so comfortable with someone and neither has he.

Her beautiful angelic smile that warms my heart to the point where I feel like my heart is about to burst, her soft hair that can only be compared to the finest silk, her soothing, smooth voice that lets me know it will all be okay, her laugh that makes my heart sing with happiness, her perfect skin, the way our hands fit together so perfectly, the way her head rests perfectly on my chest, and the magic in her eyes when we stare deeply into each other's eyes, lost in a gaze that takes us to a place where only us and our love exists.

I am truly, deeply, and completely in love with her, and she is in love with me. Nothing in this world could ever change that. Ever.

You know who you are. You're beautiful, okay? Good, I'm glad you agree. Also, I'm in love with you. But that was obvious. Now, I know this letter is going to be cheesy as hell, so if whoever else reads this isn't into that, just click the back button and be done with it. NOW, TIME TO BEGIN.

The first time I met you, you were sort of quiet. Saying something every few minutes. But every time you DID say something, it was funny as hell. Made me giggle. A manly giggle, of course, but giggle nonetheless. After that I only talked to you a few days later. That's when what we call the ""van incident"" happened.. Ahah. After that we got to talking more often, and I noticed that you were an amazing person. I wanted to get to know you better, so I did. I learned you had been having poor luck with some guys (they were idiots to let you go). I think it was then you asked me my opinion on dating with age differences. I told you it honestly, but damn, I don't think I ever wanted to tell you how I felt more than I did right then. But we both know I couldn't... I had a girlfriend at the time. So we continued talking, hung out more often, and I realized how lucky I was to have you as a friend, if not as a girlfriend. Our friend started saying that we were ""totally going to date."" Ha, when I heard she said that, I made it my goal to make that come true. So I think it was around then that me and my girlfriend at the time broke up.. And I used the worst excuse possible. I was really torn up about that, and you were completely there for me. And then you told me you were considering leaving. So, I decided to fess up and finally tell you how I felt. I was so scared of what your reaction might be. And then you told me you had ""a big o' crush"" on me as well. My heart probably stopped and restarted then. After a few days of our friendship being a tad less friend-y and more love-y, our friend decided to make me ask you out (I was shy as hell and scared to do it). You said yes, and our relationship began. Our friends still call me a romantic for the things I do, but I just feel that it's what a good boyfriend SHOULD be doing. We haven't been together too long but it feels like it's already been forever. You're beautiful, you're one of the nicest people I know, you're funny as hell, and you have a magnetic personality.

We went to high school together, I graduated 11 years ago, 9 years ago for her.  We knew each other in HS, but had little interaction since we were in different years. I was good friends with her older brother though, who was 2 years my elder.  After graduating she and I returned to our HS to speak at a panel for seniors, telling them what to expect in your first years of college, etc.  We hung out after the panel, ended up going to get coffee or something (10 yrs ago) and went to the park for a few hours, walking and talking.  We went back to my place and made out for a while, nothing too serious, you know.  BTW this was taking place during the holidays, I was home from college.  So we part ways shortly there after, she went to her college and I to mine.  We had some contact over the years via facebook, but not much.  
Early this September, I get a random message from her on facebook, ""hey _______ whats up? how have you been?"" or something along those lines.  Well let me tell you something.  I have been in love a couple of times in my life, was even engaged for a while so this aint my first rodeo, and what I have gone through the past couple of months is something like I have never experienced before.  Keep in mind we havent seen each other in a decade.  We talk about anything and everything, understand one another eerily well.  We are both artists and understand the sacrifices/hardships one has to make to maintain this career.  We see eye to eye and have a profound trust that feels so natural its almost taken for granted.  We talk on the phone everyday, txt throughout the day, skype when its possible.  We have built a foundation through these means only, and are completely in love with one another.  There will be many nay-sayers out there and thats ok, I am not looking for affirmation or anything, just wanted to share this with you because I feel like its the best thing in my life right now. 
The one issue is that she lives 2000 miles away!! I am finishing grad school in May and have never been so motivated in my life.  I will see her for the first time in Ten years in December, for three weeks.  She loves me deeply, Reddit, and I know this.  I love her too.  What do you think?  If all goes as splendidly well as I think it well in December, should I relocate to her state in the name of Love after I graduate?  I have a decent job where I am, but in my field I can go to any major city and do ok.  She is in a great city for the arts by the way, Its just on the other side of the country. Before you say to me, ""whatch out man, you have no idea whats going on"" I will say this:
I am a Trigenarian, have loved and lost and lost at love.  I know myself well after these failed relationships and have a good idea of what makes a relationship work.  Any input you have will be appreciated, although, ""I do what i Want!! ""  If anyone cares Ill keep you updated on the development of this love story.  My prediction is, I will be married by this time next year, and that sounds perfect to me.  Its game changer time Reddit!

Yerbal

Ever heard the phrase ""I'm so happy I could die?"" It's been said before, but I don't think many people really understand it. I feel like that the only perfect thing in life is death. There's just something so ultimately right about the void. When you're dead, none of your problems matter, everything ceases, and ceases to exist. Being that happy is like death. There is nothing within you but raw and perfect emotion. It's an intensely complex thing to consider, yet at the same time it's so incredibly simple. It's really beyond the scope of description, almost beyond comprehension. When you're that perfectly happy, you could be killed right then and there, and you'd welcome it. You're the only thing in my life that has ever caused me to exist in such a perfect state. I don't understand how you affect me in such a way, but this is why I will always love you. This is why I will stand by you at all costs. There is no way for me to determine with any amount of certainty if you feel something similar for me. I can only hope you have and still do.

They see it as this perfect cloud that looms slightly above their reach.  They see it, feel it, know it’s there but no matter how hard they try, they feel they always fall short of fully grabbing it.  And since according to them, and maybe you, love is perfect, if it doesn’t work out it means you are not.  So many come to me believing they are damaged.  And if they can fix themselves, they may one day jump and grab that cloud and hold on to it forever.

The truth is love can also be gritty and unfair.  It can be violent, dysfunctional, and terrifying.  Love isn’t always a cloud.  Sometimes it’s a storm, dark, cold, and destructive.  Love is not perfect.  It wasn’t meant to be.  And if you believe it is, you will only believe you are not.

Maybe it’s not you that’s damaged.

Maybe love is.

It was from a guy I had dated ten years ago.  We had remained friends all those years, and now that we were both single, he wanted to see if we could reconnect.  It was all very romantic and sweet -- we lived in different cities and hadn't seen each other in the time between, but he did everything he could to make it perfect.

We went on the trip, and while we had that great friendship to base it off of, the romantic spark wasn't there.  So much so, that on the fourth morning of the trip, he explained to me that he was still in love with his ex.  I was hurt, but I didn't think it was going that direction anyway, so we parted ways and haven't spoken since.  It didn't break my heart, but it wasn't a great time.

Fast forward to last week.  I've been dating, I had a profile on OkCupid but took it down a few weeks ago because I just wasn't finding what I was looking for and I was kind of tired of looking.  For as long as I can remember I've browsed craigslist for fun, but I've mostly avoided dating from there -- it's just too sketchy in my experience.  While browing the m4w, I found an ad that I had to respond to, but not in any romantic sense.  I just had to share my story.

The ad was from a man about a year older than me.  His ad sounded a little crazy, but I could understand.  He was looking for someone different, someone he clicked with, that undeniable first time spark.  The ad read just a little too good to be true, and the kicker was that he wanted to take someone he barely knew, but felt he may have good chemistry with, to Hawaii.  To connect.  Sounded familiar.

I couldn't help myself and sent him an email.  I wasn't answering the ad -- I took all of my PTO from work to take that trip (I took the rest of the time off of work, even though I wasn't in Hawaii after day four) and I'm a single mom.  There's no way I could take a trip like that again!  I really wanted to share my story with him and wish him better luck than I had.  I included a REALLY bad picture taken of me in Hawaii.  I never expected to hear from him.

His first email back was LONG.  He basically re-explained what he had said in his ad and asked me a lot of questions.  It was kind of as if he had the impression I was putting myself in the running for the trip.  He included a picture that wasn't exactly my type, but not HORRIBLE.  I responded and told him that there's no way I could do the trip with my circumstances, but at this point I have to admit I was intrigued.  His plan was just my brand of crazy and impetuous.  I have to admit, I probably would have ran with it if I could have.

We exchanged many more emails, and Thursday night he gave me his number and said he'd rather talk via phone or text at this point.  We had so much in common, and I really enjoyed what we were talking about during the chain of emails, so I called him immediately.  Yes, in hindsight, it was a total stalker move.  We talked for about an hour, and I let him go so I could go get something for dinner.  Before I could leave the house, he called me back and said he really enjoyed our conversation -- could he join me for dinner?  I figured why not, and we met.

When he walked in the door, my first thought was to look around him for the guy I was meeting.  He was so damned handsome!  He vaguely resembled the picture he sent, but I only realized it was him when he smiled to see me.  We met at around 8:30, but we talked way more than we ate, and we didn't leave the restaurant until around midnight.  It was amazing, we had so much in common: interests, neighborhoods, music, beliefs...it was uncanny.  We went back to my house and talked on the couch until 2:00 a.m.  We discovered we shared the same birthday.  We also discovered we really liked kissing each other.  I finally had to kick him out so I could sleep.  We texted for at least another half hour after.

The next day, he brought me flowers and lunch at work.  I was so happy to see him...it was like I'd known him for years and just reconnected with him.  He asked me out Friday night to a local bar that features old video games, something we both enjoy.  We had a wonderful time, and he ended up staying over.  Every hour we spend together, we find something else we have in common, or find a difference we can laugh over.  I'm learning so much about him, but it still feels like I've known him forever.

We've decided to throw caution to the wind and see what happens if we forge a relationship.  He's taken his craigslist ad down (I just tried to find it to link here, it's gone) and I had taken my profiles down ages before.  I'm excited.  I dated casually for seven months, and not once did I find someone who interests me like this one.  He makes my tummy flutter every time I see him.  He's just as crazy about me as I am for him, and we can TALK.  

I stopped looking, it found me.

And I'm still not going to Hawaii, but I don't think he's going to be taking anybody either.  :)

leeching our war-torn hearts from disappointing relationships. I needed a friend. You suddenly found me attractive and worth
speaking to after two or three years of going to the same college, having the same friends, going to the same parties, ecetera.
I spent months trying to figure you out, and you spent those same months vying for my attention/affection. Eventually, we both found our common ground and began to build something. 

You took me to a party with people I barely knew, and I stuck by your
side to avoid feeling like an outcast. We played beerpong and won, we ate jello shots and drank, and we returned to your
apartment and cuddled. It wasn't the sex, or the pot, or your playful nature that won me over. As we slept in your bed, you shifted onto your side in the middle of night. Before you drifted back to sleep,
you turned and planted the softest kiss on my shoulder. I remember being half awake, feeling equally elated and confused
by this gesture. I never experienced anything like that before. But something happened at that moment: My body relaxed,
I smiled, and my heart skipped a beat. I became truly infatuated with you. 

That was a year ago. You still do the very same thing: Turn over in your sleep, never fully awake. Every now and then,
you plant a kiss on some part of my body. It is sincerely my favorite thing that you do. Whenever I feel you stir at night,
if I am semi-concious, I curl up next to you in anticipation. 

In your arms, I am home. You hold me in such a way that I have no desire to let go. I can curl into the crook of your arm
and feel the most comfort I have felt in years. I can feel your chest rise and fall, and it can lull me to sleep with ease.
I can feel your lips on the tip of my head, and your arms tighten around me as if you were afraid I would float away if
you didn't hold me firmly to your body. I have never felt any of this. And now I know that this is home. 

Home is not a physical manifestation like a house or a city. Home is a feeling. It is the feeling that your heart is firmly set in 
place, the feeling of safety, and the feeling of happiness wherever you go. Sometimes the wind will rattle those
windows or extinguish the power for an hour, a day, a week. No matter. If it's a real home, it will hold up. If you have the right
tools, you can rebuild it. 

I don't want to lose my home. I thought I understood what that was like when I moved away for college four years ago.
However, you eventually deal with it. You grow and establish yourself a new residence. I never understood the fear of 
losing a home until I imagined a place without you. And the thought breaks my heart or threatens to snap it in half. 
And so I am always cleaning house, furnishing it, adding new things. This is why I still have some insecurities.
This is why I still have few nightmares of a girl, 3000 miles away, taking you away from me. This is why I try so hard, but
always cry at the thought of failing. I don't want my foundation to fall apart. 

I know that things may not last. I know not to expect everything for the future. But I can tell you now that the work
I've done is the best I've done in a very long time. Your arms are the only home I need, and they give me a glimmer of
hope that wherever I go, I will never be lost. I am in love with my home, no matter how run down it may be after sometime. 
That will never change.

Nothing more. ,justchatting,20,1,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/me73e/just_my_story_nothing_more/,"I grew up in a very loveless, hate-filled home. My dating life was nothing more than going through the motions, because when you are a teenager, that's what you do. I was quite confident after seeing my parent's marriage, I would never get married and spare myself that misery. 

When I met the first person I fell in love with, he was the last person I'd ever expect to date. After a surprising and unexpected kiss, we ended up dating for three and a half years and my stance on marriage and love in general changed. Love was possible, even for a broken person like myself. I can't count the times we laughed and danced together, loving each others company. I saw myself having a family with him. He loved children. He was free-spirited and carefree. He seemed to love life. 

But, as life dictates, things must change. He became quiet, secretive, and would wave off any problem I felt we needed to discuss. After supporting him after failing out of school, getting a DUI, and even sexually assaulting me, the straw that broke the camel's back after all that time was him not willing to talk through any issue. After countless nights of crying myself to sleep, thinking back on the wonderful times we had, and even doubting my own discomfort after being held down and forcibly fucked without my consent, I walked. I had grieved toward the end enough and it wasn't as heartbreaking as one would assume after being with your first love for that long. 

My mother would always tell me that it's okay to end it if you don't think its right. She said there are many men to meet and many will treat you just as well, if not better. I never took much stock in my mothers words when I was younger, as young people often do. But she was right. I did meet someone. 

I met him at a bar, going out with co-workers, enjoying single life and freedom. I knew him previously. He was in the same program as me when I took that major at college and worked at the liquor store so he sold me booze a handful of times. We were re-introduced by my co-worker who went to high school many moons ago with him, and we commenced talking. We had both taken Japanese in school and drunkingly spoke to each other in it. My co-workers eventually left me alone, seeing that I was preoccupied. I was.

As cynical, broken, and reluctant as I was after that first love, I took a plunge because what did I really have to lose? It worked out. No one has been more tender, sweet, endearing, and thoughtful as this man has. His eyes sparkle when he laughs. He looks at me with such tenderness that it melts my heart. He carried a desk someone left on a curb because he knew I needed one without being asked.  I sprained my ankle and he took it on himself to carry me up and down my stairs in my apartment building. He's done my laundry because it was his day off and he simply could. 

I am sorry I am gushing, r/love. I'm just over the moon. I have this great urge to explain my happiness. We've been dating for a few months now and I am still astonished by how good this man is and how I fell for him. I want to be just as good to him as he is to me. 

Here's some words of hope to those who split with a serious partner: It gets better. It does, trust me. And oftentimes, it works even better than you expected. Keep your chin up. ",,False,,t5_2qhnh,True,,,True,t3_me73e,http://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/me73e/just_my_story_nothing_more/,

I don’t know that you quite get it yet.  Maybe you do.  It’s a pretty hard thing to get.

Things so massive that they are impossible to put into the mind have crashed together and warred.  This universe coalesced from the birth and death of galaxies.  We were born from the aether and yet are made from parts of infinite intricacy.  And you doubt that you are beautiful.  You doubt that you are special.  Don’t.

I don’t know what this is all about or what the grand purpose is.  If it even has a grand purpose.  Maybe this whole delicate construction is just a giant music box.  The components will click together and two dancers will rise out of the middle.  The music starts playing.

Because that is what I want.  I want to take you dancing.  I want some grand ballroom where we are in the center of a room full of people and the air smells like fresh-cut wood or peaches or homemade ice cream.

I want to show you a river and see what you look like standing ankle deep on the smooth, round rocks in that clear stream.

I want to get drunk as hell with you in the corner of a bar and hear you go on for hours about something, anything, everything.  

I want to hold your hand in the house you grew up in. 

I want us to go to an art supply store and pick up things haphazardly, then take them home and make wild, mad creations while watching a terrible movie.

I want to be terrified, absolutely terrified, of losing someone.

I want to get into fights then laugh it off and really forget about it.

And I know you are right there because I have seen you.  I have seen your silhouette on the marquee screens of my dreams.  I have seen your laughter flicker in lamplight reflection off someone else’s eyes.  When I looked for you there, you were gone.  But I had seen you.  I know you are there.

Believe me, you are beautiful.  I’ve seen you.

I will just have to turn the key on the music box until I see you again.

Here I go. When you were in AP environmental last year, I guess you could say you caught my eye. I thought maybe, just maybe that we could start something filled with happiness. And we did. We became friends and I got to know you. I got to know that you love music, you love to eat :P, you love to laugh that funny laugh of yours and your smile is gorgeous and contagious. I learned you're beautiful, charismatic, cute, dorky. And don't forget personality wise your amazing. Before your high school career ended I wanted to move to another level with you. I'm ashamed I  couldn't tell all of this to you in person. I was going to tell you this after the Black Keys concert, but I never got a chance. So I'm asking you this now, are you willing to give me a chance? I know I'm not the best looking guy out there, I know I'm not the smartest guy out there. I do however know that I have personality that brings out the laughter in people. I want to bring out that laughter in you. Let's take things slow, very slow. I know we both have school studies to focus on but we don't have to meet every day, every week. We can sporadically be together when we have time. Once every two weeks is good enough.

He has Reddit, but he doesn't frequent r/love... which is a little sad, because I love /r/love.

Anyway. The point. 
David and I have been dating since October 8, 2009, and I know that's not really all that long (that's what... 14 months?) but it feels like forever. Not in the ""ugh, this is taking forever to end"" kind of way, but in the ""this is the perfect situation and I never **want** it to end"" kind of way. I'm with this boy day in and day out and there's nothing I want more than to live with him for the rest of my life, no kids, just us and our lives. I want to have ""his"" and ""her"" towels, and I want to have separate drawers for our bathroom supplies. I want to get into bed knowing that if he's not in there already, he will be shortly. I want to make dinner with him with utensils and pots and pans that belong to us exclusively. I want to split the cost of groceries, and I want to combine our prized possessions in a comfortable little home that I will love coming back to.

Currently I live with my mother and my three younger brothers, and I hate it here and I haven't been happy in a very, very long time. It's dirty here, so I can't even try and be a neater, tidier person. If I buy something especially for me, it's gone within seconds anyway. Privacy is at the very bare minimum. He currently lives with his 2 roommates, which is fine and dandy - but it's not what we want. I can say we because he's told me this is what he wants too, and if I had the means (the financial means, mostly), I would be living with him right now. If I could, I would leave in a heartbeat to be with him.

To me, we have one of the most stable young relationships I know of, and I love it. I feel secure, and happy, and best of all, I'm still head over heels for the guy.

I don't know why, but I do. I've only known you a few weeks, but you're all I think about. Maybe I have something wrong with me. Maybe I get too attached too quickly. I don't know. I just want to be happy and you make me happy.
I realize I'm acting like an idiot, probably, and that you've probably never met a guy who is in a rush to jump into a relationship. I'm just a genuine guy, just a really nice genuine guy. Maybe that's what's wrong with me. I'm too nice. I care too much. But is that really a reason to end things with me? Because I'm TOO NICE? That I actually CARE that much about you? I thought that that is what everyone in the world was searching for, someone who genuinely cares about them. I realize it went fast. I should probably have waited to say that ""I love you"" for a later date. 
	I had been thinking that I felt it, but that I was definitely going to wait and say it, at least wait a month or two at minimum. But then the whole thing happened where you kind of said it and it was kind of weird, and y'know I really don't remember every word of the conversation but I remember asking you if it would be weird if I felt the same way, and you said no. I still didn't say it though. Later on the next week when you were upset, you said that no one LOVED you. There was a short moment of silence, probably only a second or two but a thousand things played in my mind trying to decide if I should say it or not, so I took a chance and said it.
I'm sorry if that freaks you out, I don't want to be the guy who comes on too strong. And I get it, we're moving really fast. Let's just slow down, take the time to get to know each other more. I still want to be together, have a relationship, but we can absolutely slow it down.
	Now here I am wondering if that can even happen. You seem so upset and torn in your decisions, I don't want to be the one to make you feel that way. So we can just end it if you want. Pretend it never happened, I'm testing out of our class together anyway so you won't even have to see me. If that's what would make you happy, say the word and we'll do it.
I just don't want that. I don't want to be the guy who makes you feel torn and upset. I want to be the guy that you can talk to about anything, be comfortable with, and share your life with. I LOVE YOU THOUGH. WHY IS THAT SUCH A BAD THING? Why does it make someone freak out when someone cares deeply for them? Why is that something to run away from and NOT KNOW IF YOU WANT? Would you rather have someone who doesn't care about you? Who beats you and is a fucking alcoholic loser? Or is it just me? WHAT THE FUCK. OH MY GOD I'M SO FUCKING MISERABLE WITH THIS SHIT. WHY COULDN'T YOU JUST FUCKING SAY IT WAS TOO EARLY TO SAY THAT YOU LOVED ME TOO AND IT COULD HAVE STOPPED THERE.
	Someone told me that they think you have feelings for someone else, or that you're sleeping with someone else. I told them they were full of shit. I know you aren't sleeping with anyone else, but it did make me wonder if you had feelings for someone else. I think you still have feelings for your ex. Fuck your ex, he sounds like a piece of shit. A guy with 10x the problems I have, hell, 100x, or a 1000x the problems I have. All the shit that you've told me, how could you have ever even looked at him twice? Much less spend that much time with him? God. What's my biggest problem? That I fucking care too much? Oh my god fucking run as far away from me as you can because I fucking care about you. Fuck my life.
I seriously hate my life. I'm miserable as shit. The one good thing I had, you, is probably breaking up with me. I can face it now, you want to break up with me, but you don't know how to do it and you don't want to hurt me. I can understand that, I'm a nice guy and you hate to be the BITCH THAT BREAKS HIS FUCKING HEART, but what can you do right? He cares about you a lot so you better ditch his ass QUICK.
	I'm so sick of this. Why can't you just care about me back? Are you fucking made a stone? What is wrong with people.

Please read this whole post before you judge me. As I've said I am 12 and I am going into year 7 this year. Last year I joined a new basketball team, with some of my cousins classmates. And one of these classmates was a girl who when I met I just talked with and was friendly like usual. Then after a while she just randomly popped up in my head in random places, and I would smile when I thought of her name. She is not going to the same high school as me, but we are still going to be playing basketball. It has been 5 months now since I met her and I have just been trying to ignore the feelings I feel, because I know about the hormones at a high at puberty. So I've been hoping it's just a phase I'm going through, because high school is a big thing for me and I don't want to be distracted. I also have been putting it off because this is the first girl I've actually thought I've loved and I don't want to be hurt in the future. I've talked to my friends about it but I am still not sure whether I should ask her out. I know a lot of people think young love is not true love. I believe in young love, myself.

To say we're friends, even acquaintances, might be thinking too wishfully. In seventh grade I was sitting next to her in PE in the kickball line, and when I had dozed off and she said ""Go"" to me, I became immediately infatuated. In eighth grade we had health together (although we sat on opposite sides of the room), and I couldn't do anything but think about her, a bit cheesy, I know, but it's not a lie either. In ninth we had nothing together, sans exchanging a couple glances when walking past each other in the hall.

Now I'm in tenth grade, and I have history with her. She sits diagonally from me. Every morning I plan out what I'll say to her, and every night bang my head against my bedroom wall when I realize another day has passed, and that I don't have very many of them left. Less than a week ago we've been assigned projects by our teacher in groups of five, and I was miraculously assigned to her group. I'm now with her, in a group, and every moment I'm spending thinking about her I get sweaty and my heart starts pounding. I know I've been fortunate to be in this group with her, and I have the opportunity to talk to her, and I've never been able to get out more than, ""Yeah, that looks good,"" or ""How does this sound?"". When I see all the people that missed their chance, I know for a fact mine is now. There's a week left until this project is due, but after that it's back to square one as far as interaction. I can safely say I have never been more frustrated at myself in my somewhat inexperienced 15 years of living.

I've read about every person's perspective, every website's guide, and I simply can't muster the courage to do it. I can't do the ""small talk"", or ""act natural""...this *is* my natural! Am I forsaken? Fortunately for me, I think she might feel somewhat elevated above the ""person"" level regarding me. When we exchange glances as I had previously mentioned, she quickly looks away, and other small things like that. I guess that's a pro. I remember spending my summers only wondering if she even knows who I am, please don't let me waste this!

Long, black hair. I instantly like you. You look at me like I'm the same as every other girl in that school. I wish I hadn't worn my faded lemon shirt, and try to subtly push back the sleeve to reveal the Slayer cuff underneath. You don't see it.

***

It's the end of the day and I'm making my way out of the Science building. As I walk down the stairs, you walk across the corridor. You see my band t-shirt (Slayer, of course) and double-take. You walk backwards to make sure you'd seen what you thought you'd seen. You give a look of approval and walk on. 

I'm at the bus stop and you show up. You walk right up to me.

""Finally, someone in that place with taste!"" 

You introduce yourself to me and declare that you are the Muffin Man. You chase my little sister and her friends, playing the Scary Metalhead. I laugh, but can barely talk to you. I'm shy. 

***

I see you again in a club. You wonder where I've been, why you haven't seen me around for a couple of weeks. I've been on holiday. 

You offer to buy me a drink. I don't want to look stupid, so I ask for a Vodka and Coke rather than my usual alcopop. You compliment my new Megadeth tee. 

You chat me up, alot. I like it. You ask if I'm single and I say yes. You act like you don't believe me, but it's just more flattery. You put your arm around me and you kiss me. It was a great kiss; my first and favourite. 

***

We have our second kiss by the bus stop. It's in front of a lot of the girls from school but I don't care. We joke and kiss and I love every second of it. It's late October and it's freezing, but I can barely feel the cold. 

***

We've been seeing each other for a few weeks. I'm smitten. I stay up late most nights hoping to catch you on MSN. I get butterflies whenever you sign in. 

I ask you how your weekend was. You tell me that it was great; you went to the pub with your girlfriend.

Girlfriend.

What? 

***

I'm sad that you were seeing other people besides me, but I want to be your friend anyway. I get a boyfriend and you seem kind of jealous. 

You break up with your girlfriend and I'm having problems with my boyfriend. He's cheated on me, but he doesn't have the decency to face me. I see you in the bar and you're losing it over something. You scream at your friends and they leave you to it. I stay. I let you scream at me and I scream back. It feels good to shout at you.

Even so, I tell you that I'm here for you, and no matter what you say to me, I won't move. You cry on my shoulder and get snot on my top. 

***

I've broken up with my boyfriend and we're sitting on a stage in a dark corner. We kiss and it feels like something has fallen into place; like I haven't been a whole person for a long time, but I didn't know it. 

***

We've been seeing each other again and our mutual friend has been on at you to ask me out properly. 

In early May, by the bus stop, you tell me that he threatened to kick you in the balls if you didn't. 

""Fuck it, will you go out with me?""

I know you're doing this for the wrong reasons, but I'm sixteen and I am so very into you. Of course, I say yes. 

***

I'm missing you one night, and you come on MSN. We sit on webcam for hours. We're not even speaking. You're playing WoW and occasionally looking into the cam. I'm mostly just watching you. I watch you for hours. It makes me happy, but for some reason it also makes me sad.

***

I've just arrived at your house. I walk into the kitchen and you're standing at the open window. You turn around and hold me. You tell me that you had a dream where you lost eveyone that you loved, where you lost me. I tell you that I'm here now, and that it was just a dream. A cool breeze comes through the window and raises the hairs on my arms. 

You cheer up and we have lunch. You kiss me. Your mouth is full of chewed Wotsits, which you transfer into my mouth. You know I hate them, and burst out laughing at my horror. 

***

We're leaving a party, being driven home by your dad. It's only a little after 8pm and the sun has just set. You hold my hand in the back seat and lean close.

""I think I'm falling in love with you"" you whisper.

A lump catches in my throat and I can barely get the words out.

""Me too.""

***

We're on the bench by the bus stop. It's mid-May. The sky is summer-blue and the few clouds are white and lazy. I lean back against you and you buzz teasingly in my ear, making fun of my fear of bees. We laugh and you hold me. An idle breeze caresses my hair. I feel so at peace; so happy. 

***

It's early June and I've just sat an exam. I've been laughing with friends, telling jokes and feeling amazing. It's like a weight has been lifted off. 

I wait at the bus stop to meet you. You show up and ask me if I want to get a drink. We walk to the pub across the road and sit by a window overlooking the bus stop. I pay for the drinks, but you go to the bar as I'm not old enough. 

You sit down and we talk about our exams. And then, out of nowhere:

""Do you think this is working?""

My honest answer would have been no. You have such a huge personality and I feel overwhelmed by it. I can rarely think of anything to say, because you and your family are all so similar and I feel like I'm boring. 

""Yes.""

You proceed to break up with me. It's not me, of course, it's you. This isn't permanent, it's a ""break"". You're not comfortable in your own head, you can't deal with the silences. 

Of course, that makes little sense, as we don't spend a lot of time together. Why are my silences so much worse than the ones when you're alone? I don't understand and I want to ask why, but I can't find my voice. I just concentrate on getting to the bottom of my glass. 

***

I'm on the bus home and I let a few tears escape. We're staying friends and I have to seem OK with that. 

***

I get home and tell my mum I have a cold. I go to bed, but I don't sleep. I don't sleep for three days. It feels like someone has punched me in the chest. It hurts to breathe.

***

I'm sitting on my computer in late June and I see a picture of you and the girl you took to your prom. Is she the reason why you ended it? I feel sick. 

***

It's November and I've barely seen you since we broke up. You've been avoiding me. You ask me if I want to get a drink after college. I accept, because I want to be your friend. 

We drink and drink and drink. We catch up. We leave. I'm seventeen and I'm drunk and I still love you. I lose my cool. I shout at you for calling it a break just so that I'd stop opposing the break up. It was a shitty thing to do. I cry. You cry. We kiss. 

***

A few weeks later you ask me if I want to get back together. I say no. I'm seeing someone. That doesn't work out and for a long time I regret turning you down, but really nothing had changed and the end result would have been the same. 

***

I believe that love is never the same twice. I could look back on this now, almost seven years since I first met this guy, and I say that I never loved him. I could say that I was just a young girl who was infatuated with a boy. That would be a disservice. Just because I have loved since, and loved differently, doesn't mean that what I felt wasn't love. Those feelings were real and when I look back I can feel it all. It was ""teenage love"" and it was filled with hormones and paranoia, innocence and hope. The heartbreak taught me to be strong, but it also taught me to be cynical. I have never loved like that since, I have never allowed myself to become so vulnerable so quickly. I learned to build walls and I became a fortress. 

Still, I love every single one of those memories; the good and the bad. I love thinking of them, and feeling like I'm right back there. I love the explosive happiness of our first kiss; the calming warmth of him holding me; the earth-shattering feeling of him ending things. They're fond memories with a friend I still hold dear, and I wouldn't change a second of it.

When you see the twinkle in someone's eye, when you get all nervous over silly things in someone presence. When you first get together you can't get enough of each other. To be in love is like nothing else in the world. The visions of the future, the hope, the possibilies feel endless. Sharing life with another even after the initial love sickness settles is another treasure in life. To be able to give to a partner, to take care of them when they aren't feeling well, to reminisce in on old times. You would do anything to see a smile upon their face again. The warmth of a home made by the union of two (for some more) people. Cooking together, taking baths together or getting dirty in the garden together. The simple thing shared with another you love are even sweeter. Eventually in all cases love is lost. They might catch another's eye or you too may disagree too often, the love you felt may just fade and interest becomes lost. Eventually all love of not ended by a fight or another lover will end (as far as we know it) by the final rest we call death. The loss of a lover is like no experience on earth. You may not eat or you may eat too much. You may not sleep or you may sleep to avoid being awake. Things that were once fond memories may become triggers of agony. You might just cry until you have no tears left to shed. You may think you will never love again. But you just might. Love comes and love goes. Though in some ways love is never lost. I still have a deep love for the lovers who truly touched my heart. Once the pain fades the memory of love can return. You may not see them ever again but you may still have a special place in your heart for them. Love touches us deeply moves us to try new things and step out of our comfort zone. Love is a garden we grow with another. We can choose to keep it well watered and fertilized or you can let it grow weeds and wilt. Even if your garden is lost their will almost always be another plot to till or lawn to convert.

 A customer of mine came into the shop today. I hadn't seen him in over a year, since just after Kristy &amp; I had returned from our Vegas trip. We greeted one another and caught up on the events of the last 15 months. I told him that Kristy and I had broken up seven weeks ago. In an effort to be cheerful, he asked me ""well, are you happy to be single again?"". I paused before providing the obligitory 'aww, hell yeah!' that my male bravado required me to supply. These are reflex responses, the little lies that we use to shield us when revealing the truth would unmask us and expose our vulnerability. Pausing, I realized I hadn't really given that particular question much thought. 'Am I happy to be single again?'. In that brief instant, I experienced what some would call a flashback, others a moment of clarity.
  It was an anonymous fall Sunday, late afternoon. Football on the tv, volume way down. Orange and magenta twilight peeking through the blinds as daytime wanes and reluctantly gives way to early winter sunset. Dinner won't be for several hours, and Kristy and I lie on the sofa front-to-back, spooning on the narrow cushions. She dozes, and i feel the pleasant numbing of my arm as her bodyweight presses down on it. I can feel her warm breath on my skin, smell the fresh-linen scent of her hair, and the faint, steady throb of her pulse as it thrums into my hand on her hip. She stirs briefly, reconfiguring the shapeless jumble of blanket and socked feet at the end of the sofa, and resettles sleepily. She takes my hand and pulls it to her chest, hugging it, issuing a gentle sigh and a contented murmur as she slips back to sleep. As we lay embracing, I come to understand the joining, the merging of two people as one. The harmony of taking each breath in unison, the intimacy and wonder of holding the one you love. I never want this feeling to pass, this peaceful moment to end. I know our nap will be over in 90 minutes or less, but for now this is as it should be, as it's meant to be. In this quiet bliss, the hard feelings of our future breakup will never take root, the hurtful words will never be given voice. 
  I stand a little unsteadily in front of my customer. He wears a look of slight concern. A wave of emotion washes over me, overtaking me like a riderless carriage. I am reeling a bit from the powerful memory that floods my senses, and suddenly there is sadness. A knowing, a certainty that I will never have that perfect moment with Kristy again. The loss is palpable within me, as if something vital has been stolen, wounding my spirit. I look away, formulating an excuse to be anywhere else right now as tears well up in my reddening eyes. As I force a weak smile, the words escape me in a haunted whisper, as if spoken by a ghost. ""happy? no. not really"".

I never believed that the small things could add up to something meaningful-- until I met you. 

It started with seeing ""[Your Name] likes this"" on a friend's Facebook page nearly a year ago today. That led to adding each other (because I thought you were someone I knew) and continuing the like-fest. I remember looking at your pictures and saying ""Hm, she's kind of cute."" in the most normal of ways. I had no clue then that I was talking to the most beautiful, most interesting, funniest person I'd know. We had our first conversation that night and my life has never, ever been the same, and I have never, ever gone a day without thinking of you. A conversation that was full of sarcasm, wit, commonality, and that I'll never forget. 

I'll skip ahead a little, to the day we first hung out. I admit that we could've seen each other earlier that week, but I was so afraid of saying or doing the wrong thing, of not living up to some standard, to not keeping that chemistry going. Not only was I wrong, but all the things that we enjoyed about each other were amplified and the chemistry was stronger that I could've imagined. 

The time that we had together was truly the greatest point in my life, all of it. Laying against me on a park bench, staring out at the stars, and me telling you to come back to me at the exact moment you started to drift. Going out for a beer and a burger. You, half on my lap, with your beautiful necklace swinging in my face, with a way of honestly looking at me that I've never seen before. Even the time away from each other was not in vain, because it reinforced how no one could ever fill the void that you left. 

Today is your birthday. I don't know if you'll read this, but I just wanted to put out there how truly lucky I am to have had you in my life. I still think about you every waking day, I still love you more than you will ever know, and I wish you nothing but the best.

1335371467.0,16,self.love,srygg,unsolicited love advice from a man who has fucked up and finally learned from it...,ishouldquitsmoking,17,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/srygg/unsolicited_love_advice_from_a_man_who_has_fucked/,"This was originally a throwaway response to someone about a year ago asking for advice.  I've edited it and taken out a lot of personal stuff, but ask away if you like.  

I hope someone learns from my shitty mistakes...and finally find true love, like I've finally been so lucky to find..even this late in life.


*tl;dr - the 'one' should be someone that you share mutual love and respect with and is truly your best friend - so sayeth this asshole*

I don't know how old you are, but let me give you some unsolicited advice.  Coming from a man who has really fucked up a lot in life and in relationships but has finally found that 'one.' 

As much as I hate the fucking cliche and it's read at every wedding and I've cringed every time I've heard it...and it's even painful for me to admit that..but, it'll make sense in a few minutes:

""Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth."" 

-- I'd like to add that it's mutual and not one sided.  That whole saying goes for BOTH people, not just you.  You can be all of those things but if your SO isn't, then there's no fucking point.

I'm almost 38 years old and I'm a professional with post-graduate degrees..and I'm also in the middle of my second divorce.  Why? because I'm a fucking idiot.  But, being an idiot has made me humble.

My first marriage sucked because I was young and she was younger.  We grew apart, I learned from it.

My second marriage sucked because I was so hung-up on the destruction of my first marriage that I thought I was screwed up and that eventually things would get better only to realize, we were both screwed up and we were both assholes to each other.  After a lot of tears and heartache we realized we had competing egos and pride and didn't really love each other, we loved the idea of each other.   We were both wrong and both too proud and stupid to admit it and it just continued to fuel the fire...exponentially.  :sadface:

Now.  What have I learned from those two massive fucked up relationships?  Simple.  Find your best friend. Not just a friend.  Find your best friend that is really your best friend that you also want to bang 9 ways to Sunday at any given moment.  

Find the one you can't wait to see.  Don't make that shit up.  ""oh, I want to see Julie because that's what boyfriends/husband's say!"" -- bullshit. You should genuinely crave to see them..and want to tell them every funny fucking thing that happened today.

In sum,

* Be happy with yourself and where you are and what you believe.
* Find the person you genuinely want to tell everything to.
* Find the person you want, not the person you need.
* Find the person that compliments your personality.  But isn't too different from you.
* Find the person that enjoys being with you as much as you enjoy being with them.
* Find the person who talks you down off that ledge and isn't an asshole about it.  
* Find that person that picks you up when you're down and doesn't make you feel like a pussy for getting down once in a while...because it's a normal part of life!!
*Find that person you'd rather sit on the couch with and play scrabble and watch shitty tv with than do anything else.  That doesn't mean always and that's all you'll do...but when it comes down to rainy boring Saturdays, those should be the moments you want and cherish.
* Find that person you're not afraid to be vulnerable with who also isn't afraid to be vulnerable with you.
* Find that person you have mutual love and respect for.  

--Marriage and relationships have no room for pride or ego. 

--That's the person you settle down with.

--A friend of mine described it as ""there are 10's in love.  Wait for your 10.  That doesn't mean that you won't find and enjoy a 7 or an 8 or even a 9...it just means, wait for your 10.""  I firmly believe that to be true.  Learn from the 7,8's and 9's...because there will surely be those.  But, as for marriage, wait for your 10.  

If you *both mutually love and respect each other*, you can navigate through this messy thing called life and do it well.  

Cheers and good luck to you.  One last thing, you shouldn't go looking for it the one, let the one come to you.  (Unless you're reading this from your mom's basement..then, get up and go look for it. But leave the stalker shit at home).

I kinda ignored it, but i knew i had a crush on her. 

A month or two after she got to Allison Steele, i decide to talk to her, and try to make her smile. (By the way, she NEVER talks to anyone). I cant remember what i said, but I made her do more than just smile, i made her blush, and laugh! I moved back to my original seat afterwords, giving her the excuse that ""i didn't like her all by herself over there, and i never saw her smile"" and that ""my work here is done!"". WAY WAY later on, i sat next to her in economics, and we talked, and shared the same interests, but somehow, I felt as if I were making her uncomfortable, so i kept my distance. 

About a week ago, I got a friend request from her on Facebook, and we started talking a bit more. We decided to hang out last Saturday, and it couldn't have gone better! We smoked the last of my shisha from my hookah, watched How to Train Your Dragon, ate some delicious pizza, and afterwords, laid down, cuddled, and watched Beavis and Butthead on Netflix. She left at about 11:30, and I couldn't stop thinking about her! She was attractive in more than just one way as well! She liked the same music, the same games, the same types of food as me, she was funny, and a thinker. Also, she was driven to do something with herself (career-wise), loved smoking hookah, ALWAYS sweet, and was a very open-minded person.

Now, we always sit next to each other, text each other, hold hands in the hallway, and she kissed me yesterday :D So far, I'm loving every last bit of what's going on. 

TL;DR    I talked to a shy girl who always sat alone and never talked to anyone, and now she's opening up, and we are currently together

My boyfriend and I have been together since September, though we've known each other for years. We went to the same high school and sat next to each other in Spanish class. When I went to college, he and I stayed close, eventually leading up to admitting our feelings for each other and sharing our first kiss in a graveyard. I couldn't be happier than I always am with him. I've been in a few long-term relationships before but I've never been in love before. And my boyfriend is just so understanding and amazing. Even though I'm still good friends with my ex (who I also live with because I'm stuck in a lease), he trusts me so much. He's also so understanding of my Celiac disease, always making sure that he uses mouthwash before kissing me and avoiding eating gluten when we go out to restaurants. I've never met anyone else with his level of kindness and patience. He even asked my mom to be friends with him on Facebook and, even more amazing, they regularly message back and forth! Not to mention the sex, which is utterly mind blowing and also so intimate and loving. Sometimes it's hard to feel like we're not alone in the world, though. I'm a college student in my senior year and he lives at home and works full time, so our schedules rarely line up. We're lucky if we get to see each other once a week. I can't even talk to anyone about it because all my friends support my ex and not me. Yet we still stick it out because of how in love we are. It's hard to see him so seldom, but seeing his eyes light up and feeling the warmth and love that we share in my heart makes it all so much more than worth it. No matter what our futures hold, we know we'll always have each other. Sharing that is the most amazing thing I've ever felt and, even if I can only share this incredible feeling with you guys and not my ""friends"", I'd never give it up for all the world.

TL;DR: I'm so in love with my boyfriend (in spite of adversity and friendlessness) and want to share this amazing feeling with you good people. &lt;3",,False,,t5_2qhnh,False,,,True,t3_opun0,http://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/opun0/im_so_in_love_reddit_3/,

I thought I had it, but realized that you can be so wrong.
you can relate places, food, and song, 
but when it's over they will be long gone
It will not matter how you feel 
don't trick yourself because here's the deal:
In all actuality it only can last so long. 
few things last forever but
It will run its course and feel right
but when it is over, there will seem to be no light 
even if you kind of subconsciously wanted the break up too.
 
So you say, ""Love, where are you?""
You think love won't return again because of this one screw up
but you'll see differently once you can see through the clouds.
You'll see the sun because, believe me, it is still there. 

Even if you feel like this was your one true love,
another will come or this one will in another time.
It might have been right, but the wrong time. 
You have to have two positives 
because a positive and a negative will cancel out.

So cheer up, because it's getting better 
even when it doesn't feel like it.
tough days will come and things will happen that you can't control.
you will freak out on the person because you forget they don't have to care anymore
But at the end of the day, you'll be happy and grateful for the time you had because ..

1345051930.0,15,self.love,y9rgg,Almost one year ago my brother Gabe passed away.  This is a tribute to him and an eye opener to all.,juliancoy,18,3,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/y9rgg/almost_one_year_ago_my_brother_gabe_passed_away/,"Almost one year ago, August 21, 2011 to be exact, my brother Gabriel died in my mother's arms.  This day also happened to be her 51st birthday.

Gabriel was 8 years old when he passed away.  Although he lived a short life, it was full of love and compassion.  Gabriel suffered from a battery of rare diseases, two of which I will describe to you.

The main illness from which he was afflicted is known as Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS).  This is a rare congenital heart defect where the left ventricle of the heart is severely underdeveloped.  Gabe also had what is known as Kabuki Syndrome.  This is believed to be a genetic defect with multiple congenital abnormalities and intellectual disabilities.

Despite all of Gabes issues, he was a kid that almost always smiled (except for in front of the camera, that was a little more rare), and rarely was in a bad mood.  Gabe spent over 600 nights in the hospital, most of which my mother tended his side.

In May of 2011, Gabe was granted a trip to the 'Give Kids The World' (GKTW) village in Florida by the Make-A-Wish (MAW) foundation of South Carolina.  This was the last time I was with Gabe and my family before he passed away.  Here is a video of the trip that my father made: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn2vCDqpAV0

During that week, my family experienced the undisputed best time of ALL of our lives.  We were treated like family and given care unparalleled before and since.  Not one penny was lifted from our pockets, as there was no way my family could have afforded any of this trip.  We were given a rental van for the week, we were given a house to stay in, and all meals were provided for.  The pizza delivery guy wouldn't even take a tip!  Not only were we given a place to stay, but the GKTW and MAW groups provided my family with free tickets to go to any and all of the Disney theme parks for our entire stay.  Just so you know, my brother absolutely LOVED Disney.  Mostly the princesses :P  But I can tell you this, he had never smiled as much as he did that week.

That's not all they did for my family.  Normally the age limit for siblings to participate in these trips is limited to 18 years old.  I was in the Navy at the time and I was also 22 years old.  My sister, Carra, was 20 years old and in college.  The GKTW village made a complete exception and allowed our entire family to attend this monumental event in Gabe's life.  My chain of command and Carra's school also went out of their way to make sure we made it to this trip.  To this day I still am amazed by the love and compassion that was shown to my family during this time.

None of us knew how little time we had left with Gabe.  If it were not for the GKTW village and the MAW foundation, my family would have never had this wonderful experience and the last memory I would have had with Gabe would have been at the airport six months before he passed away.

Gabe was a miracle.  And the way he lived his life showed my family what God is capable of doing for us during times of despair and tragedy.  I also learned what the definition of love is.  It is selfless care for another, without the need for recompense.  I thank God every day for the people at the GKTW village and the MAW foundation.

I just wanted to share this story, the story of Gabe's last days, to let you all know that there is love in this world.  There is good.  And there is a God.  Tragedy will strike in a moments notice, but there is solace in the realization that this life is not the end.

TLDR: My brother Gabe passed away on August 21, 2011.  My family was allowed complete and totally free access to the Give Kids the World Village in Florida, to spend the best week of our lives together.  We had every single cost covered, and we were completely loved by everyone there.  Thank you Give Kids The World, thank you Make-A-Wish, and thank you God for giving us Gabriel Michael Coy.

love is a funny thing because it will take your heart, break it, give it back, and take it again, its like a roller coaster ride, but even though its scary, you want to keep riding.

love is magical,
it leads you to a place where no one can tell you how you feel, you can't explain it, because love just is,

Love is universal,
no matter who you are, and no matter the color of your skin,love will find you, love is blind.

you may not be looking for love but when you find someone, your whole point of view, on everything changes, you care more about everything, and care less about what people say

I looked at him and thought about what he said and I did't completely agree with him. I said, ""That is not what love is, good sir. Love is the ever changing feeling of want. When you look at someone and can barely muster the strength to talk to them. When she looks at you and your heart races. All you want is to be around her at every moment. You can't stand to be away from her. You long to hold her and never let go. That, sir, is what love is.

He just sighed and began to walk away saying, ""Yet another one who doesn't understand, what a pity.""

I stopped him and asked him to explain.

He turned to me and stared me straight in the eyes. He began to speak. ""Do you believe that we as humans have souls?""

""Well, yeah, I guess. I'm not religious but I do believe that we have souls. Why?""

""That is the first step to understanding. You see, the soul wants doesn't want a complete opposite, then it will constantly be at odds with another. But it also does not want a copy, then things will come too easy. The soul needs a counterpoint, a little bit of difference and a little bit of the same. It's very rare to find the perfect counterpoint but there may be a few in your lifetime. All it takes is a little effort. Once the counterpoint is found, the soul is internally conflicted. It cannot decide whether to be accept or dispel this counterpoint. These conflictions cause the heart to pound, the breath to shorten, the want to never let go. Uncontrollable nervousness.""

""So what you're saying, good sir, is that the soul causes these wondrous feelings and we just call it love?""

""Yes.""

",RebekahRave,15,3,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/nx5k2/this_is_my_love_story_for_anyone_whos_interested/,"Hey, guys. So, to start with a little background, and something I've never openly spoken about, I was sexually abused when I was younger by a friend of the family. More than once, I feared for my life too much to tell. Granted, I was twelve. Now, I'm 16, and I've been sexually manipulated by men since then. I grew fearful of relationships, and didn't want to trust anyone,  I questioned the intents of men, and couldn't even trust people I loved. Im also in an abusive home, and have almost died with a gun to my head because of my moms abusive ex boyfriends. and can't leave until I'm 17, and don't want to leave for fear of fosterhomes. I hated life. I tried to kill myself, and failed because of my one fear of death. I was trapped in my mindset of life vs death, living and crawling through life painfully, even at such a young age, I had lost optimism. I met this boy through a friend, (fellow redditor) and was interested in him, but fearful of being broken again. We immediately hit it off, and began dating shortly after. I was scared to trust him, and was scared to have sex. We grew more and more fond of each other, he wrote me poems, laid with me for hours, and told me he loved me all the time. We were just so happy around each other, I couldn't help but know this was different. He made me comfortable around him, and made me think there was a ray of hope. The other night, we stayed up until 8 in the morning on Skype (we can't see each other often because of my abusive mom) and he just talked to me about my insecurities, about the origin, and in the end, helped me resolve all of my terrible mindsets about all men. I cried forever because it was such an amazing experience, it was a weight off my chest. I love him so much.

Now, he's also very attractive, and could get any girl he wanted, and even though we don't have sex as much as he could without me, he actually wants to be around me, and just always remind me that I'm his whole world, and without me his life wouldn't be the same at all. 

Now for the mushy part.

 So, my boyfriend and I were laying on his bed, just relaxing, when he turned the lights off so there were no lights besides some christmas lights, he turned some really soft piano music on, insense burning, and brought out some massage oil, he had me lay on my stomach shirtless, and he gave me the most mind blowing massage. (Note, I've never had a massage in my life, and this being my first, set my standards ridiculously high) for like, twenty minutes until the song ended. 
I was so happy, I thought it was the sweetest thing ever done for me, I was so happy, right when I thought it was over; then another song started. 
I lay on my back, and he gave me the most incredible, topping the last, body massage in history. Flavored massage oil, he didn't miss a spot massaging the oil in and licking it off. Now, I'm normally a pretty self-conscious person, I get worried about my appearance, and even though my boyfriend and I have a healthy sex life, I still have a hard time showing my body openly.  Mostly because of being raped and abused.  But I was just completely comfortable, it was like he loved my body even though I didn't. Each movement was in unison to the piano, and just relaxing and virtually mind blowing in pleasure. I had never felt so loved my entire life. I felt like nothing could ruin it, I began tearing because of how happy I was that someone actually loved me and would go out of their way to do that. I know I've found the person I want to be with, I don't care if I'm young, I've never felt appreciated, I've never felt a reason to live. Anyone who thinks you can't be young and be in love, and know any aspect of what you want is wrong. I've met people who meet when they're 11 and are now in their 80's and madly in love. I have situational depression, and I know he's holding me together unlike any counceling and person I've ever met. 

I hope you guys enjoyed this, I love him, and will do anything to keep him forever. ",,False,,t5_2qhnh,False,,,True,t3_nx5k2,http://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/nx5k2/this_is_my_love_story_for_anyone_whos_interested/,

I've decided to make a book called ""our story"" and from now on I'll write everytime we experience something together or make small notices about how he makes me feel from now 'till he leaves. Then make chapters for every part of our lives to come with blank pages to fill out for when he gets back. 

Is it tacky?

Her previous boyfriend (they were together for a year and 7 months) was cheating on her the entire time they were together. She didn't know until he left her. Now, she has horrible anxiety attacks anytime he is ever brought up. Today, at my local library, me and here were hanging out, and he showed up randomly. Immediately after showing up, he said he was going to leave. I asked her if she wanted to leave, and she said yes. So we were, but she was breaking down already. She went into the girls' bathroom and was in there for a few minutes. I decided that I should go in there and comfort her. I walked right in there (there was another girl at the sink that didn't notice me) and crawled under the stall that she was in. I held her while she cried, and I told her that everything was going to be okay, and that time was the only thing that could ever fix it. Not me, nor her boyfriend, nor anybody else. Just time. So we were there for quite a while, and it had just dawned on me when we were walking out that I was in the girls restroom (a felony for a guy) the whole time, talking to her and comforting her. And that's the same moment that I realized that I really do love her. 

TL;DR This girl I know had an anxiety attack, and I comforted her in the girls' bathroom, only to find out exactly where I was, and to find out that I have loved her for a long time now.

Single.

Male.

And I've had three serious relationships. 
My longest one was for 3 years and it was my best and most current former relationship. 
I had only slept with 3 people at that time (including her)...

Imagine being with someone you click completely well with, you have very to little fights, you live sanely and rationally in the same room w/o little to no issues and you both consensually enjoy life together and it's many little wonders. 

The baby names they call you, your flaws they put up with, the inside jokes, the warm cuddling and the enjoyable silences of just knowing they are there with you.

This relationship, well, was next to perfect, but something was wrong with me and this can happen to most of us guys who.. just don't know what they truly want..

And speaking for a man, I must say.. we are stupid.. sometimes we really don't know what we want but we think we do..

And literally, something was wrong with me about the idea of marrying a girl I've known for three years WITHOUT fully ""living"" and ""exploring"" what it's like to date casually and hook up (which I had never done previously prior in my engagements with women and in which I was repressed of doing most of my life). 

That side of life that went unexplored really got me curious and ate me up inside..

It's a shame to think that a great relationship you can have with someone, can, and could potentially end with the idea that that person just needs to work on themselves and who they are. 

And at times, it's a shame to admit that that was me.

Their are times I look back and realize how much of a fool I was to agree to a break up.. but nevertheless...

I went off, I was single, I had the freedom of being bound to no one but myself, I got what I wanted, I traded security and love for freedom and fun. I had gone on many dates, slept with girls and found out people are beautiful in terms of what they have to offer sexually and just who they are in general.

But..

I realized despite many of the narrow minded, cocky, and ignorant guys who brag about the hottest chick they banged or their number and their influence on people by perpetuating such a life style upon others...

How society, at times, can glorify the idea of the playboy, the bachelor and how that seems like a welcoming, wanted and free independent lifestyle for yourself..

That I painted up this idea of a cool-cat, gallant love maker, pleaser of women and James Bond-esque life style... 

That when they say love is overrated..

That..

Many of us, just want that one person. 

That one girl that fits exactly what we're looking for, who can mean everything to us and who sees us as everything... 

That lust is just so much easier to give into, follow and provides ""freedom"" but always ends up with true loneliness, no depth and absolutely no security..

Does anyone else feel this way or find themselves in a similar boat?

Believe me, I do love sex but I realize what I wanted all along was love... that I needed lust to prove to me how pointless lust really is.

Just a few venting thoughts, internet.

The dark lit room, the texture of the blankets on my legs, the steady sound of her breathing, the small pool of drool on my chest. Humans are imperfect, so it’s only suitable that this place with her is perfection for me. I wish I had a bigger body, so that my heart has more room to swell. I feel as if one would call it naive, the love I possess when I lay with this girl. It’s every cynics wet dream, every romantics ideal situation, every Mormon’s heathens nightmare. The smell of her hair alone triggers this love, and thoughts of the world are more optimistic as she slumbers with me. 
	I find comfort in knowing that intimacy is experienced by most people, and find it even more comforting that I feel intimacy with all aspects of life at an increasing rate. However no type of intimacy towards anything can compare to the haven of intimacy I experience when I lay in her bed. My bed is fine, but her security is at it’s highest when she is in her own bed, something I tend to care too much about. Her insecurity is my greatest foe it seems, and it is vanquished as I hold her; her small frame fit snugly into the crook of my larger one, hands interlocked fidgeting with each other, breathing falling in and out of sync.
	Her soft skin teems with life, and the breath she spills across me in turn amplifies the life in my own. The subtle twitches people undergo as we sleep will occasionally startle my drifting consciousness, but they are appreciated in the same way a cat crawls into one’s lap after a long day. Many times, her hair will catch the rough patches of hair underneath my chin, or a rogue hair will graze underneath my nose. How these seeming annoyances can enact such a feeling of bliss in a person such as myself is best explained by claiming unconditional love. Such a concept may just play in part with the naivety of the situation, but never has anything felt so in it’s place, or an emotion so best described.

So there is this girl that I have had feelings for ever since High School - lets call her Claire.  Claire was a freshman, and I was a senior.  At the time, we were very close but I had a GF and knew that we couldn't date.  Not only that, but like all retarded High Schooler's do, I wasn't a great friend to her.  Needless to say, she still talked to me after all I put her through, and we still talk to this day.  

The reason why I am writing this is because Claire and I met up for lunch this afternoon, and for the first time in years I got butterflies when she turned around and saw me.  She was stunning - her blond hair, her smile - it was even more beautiful than I remembered...the embodiment of perfection.  Honestly, I think I felt my heart skip a beat.  I leaned in to give her a hug and a kiss on the cheek, and I felt my knees get weak.  We really can have amazing conversations, and today was great.  We talked over sushi about anything that came to our heads, and then it was over.  She gave me a ride back to my office and drove away.

Tonight, I am going to go home and have dinner with my fiancee - not Claire, the woman I am marrying in less than 3 weeks - but I will never forget Claire and I will always think about what might have been if I had just been a little nicer, and tried a little harder.

**Moral of the story / TL;DR:**  If you have feelings for someone that you know has those same feelings for you, dont take that for granted.  I know Claire is a redditor, and I hope she reads this so she knows *exactly* how I feel.

However, I wanted to do something for her for Valentine's day. Here's where the dilemma comes in:

1) She lives in England 

2) I live in America 

3) I don't have a credit card or paypal 

4) I don't know how to ask her address without sounding creepy. I don't know her friends. 

5) If she sees USA on the envelope, she'll know it's from me. I want to keep it anonymous (whole ""no online relationship"" thing)

So, long story short, I want some ideas. I would love to be able to send her flowers or something, but that's probably out of the question. Does anyone know of something really nice and thoughtful that I could do?

I'm not sure I'm even looking for advice, but if you have any I won't turn it down.  I have a story to tell, and it starts out as a pretty great one.

I had this friend when I was a kid.  I'll call her Katie.  Katie and I were best friends, we did everything together when we were 11, 12, 13.  We snuck our mom's cigarettes and alcohol, we went sledding together, we spent basically every spare moment with each other.  We were neighbors in a small apartment building in rural Maine, so there was always a lot of time with nothing going on but our own entertainment.  There was nothing romantic when we were kids, just that special kind of friendship where you trust the other person in the implicit way only a child can manage.

Katie and I grew up poor.  I mean, really just dirt poor.  She lived with her sister and mom, and I lived with my brother and my mom.  By the time we met we had each already moved 14 or 15 times, so that short period of stability was just somehow magically different.  That time period is the happiest of my life, Reddit.

Unfortunately, like so many other good things, it had to come to an end.  My mother unexpectedly moved us one weekend to another town.  Back then internet access was something common folks just didn't really have, so staying in contact wasn't easy.  Shortly after that her mom abandoned she and her sister and subsequently was arrested and imprisoned for several years.  We completely lost track of each other other than memories.

Periodically over the years as the internet grew and as various services became popular we'd look for each other, but we always missed, until this past October.  She found my Facebook profile (which I'd only recently allowed non-friends-of-friends to send requests to) in October.  We got together to play a game of pool and catch up (it'd been eighteen years at that point, after all).  We stayed longer than we intended, and made plans to go out again.  Long story short, by mid-November we were officially together.

From that point I felt like I was living a kind of mid-life fantasy - at 30 I had re-met the woman of my dreams and my best friend, all at once.  The best part?  Neither one of us was in a relationship at the time, neither one of us had been married or even had a recent serious relationship.  I have no children of my own, and while she does have a precocious little boy he seems to like me pretty well and I'm growing pretty attached to him too.

Here's the problem, Reddit.  I'm a single guy.  I've always been a single guy.  Not because I don't dare to ask women out, or because I'm disfigured or unpleasant.  I'm always single because I *enjoy* being single.  I try the relationship thing a few times a year, and I always feel like it was a terrible mistake after a month or so and find myself wishing I was single again - so I make that the case.  Unfortunately this has cause quite a bit of pain to women who don't deserve it over the years.  Each time I feel like maybe this time it'll be different, and each time I end up leaving.

I don't have that feeling yet, but I'm terrified that I will.  I've talked to Katie about my past, and she knows how it's been and wants to try anyway.  I do too.  But what if it *is* the same?  This time it's something serious I could fuck up, something truly precious and rare.  A chance for something people just don't get.  There's her son as well - he's already going to have a tough enough time with a Dad that could give a shit about him; I don't want him to get too attached to me if that's the case either.

It had been so long in the making, and had the roughest start of any relationship I've thus far encountered, but for the months that it has been going on, it has been well worth it. We both carry baggage, in some regards more than one another. But there is nothing that one of us will not do for each other. When we stare into each others eyes, we get lost. This past weekend she came with me to a brony meet up, and at the saturday market we were all stopped by this old man who was offering us poetry. He offered me a poem to give to her one day. It really is a good poem, of apt description of how I feel whenever I'm around her. Anyway. People have been waiting, apparently, for the day when we actually got together.

Long story short Ron and I fell in love with each others personalities. My guy at the time would have nothing of it and maliable me believed him when he told me to cut off all ties with Ron. I deleted Ron from everything. I felt empty. I talked to Ron's friends and they were telling me how he was shutting himself off from everyone days after. He didn't understand, and I couldn't tell him. But what I didn't give up was his email. He emailed me on my birthday and on special days. He might of hated me, and he had every reason to, but he still tried to fight for me. Longer story short a year went by, I broke up with douche. One day I was playing Guild Wars and I forgot I still had Ron as a GW friend. His lvl40 Monk was online. We talked. And the spark was on again. Ever since we've been confiding in one another, trusting one another. 

Until finally he flew down to where I lived. We had the best weekend ever. I'm planning to fly up to where he lives in February. Our plans are for him to permanently fly down here to live with me.

It all started back in August of this year, I had revived a PM from a girl on one of my alternative social networking sites, now this wasn't just any girl but it was the girl I had been secretly in love with after stumbling upon her profile online maybe a year or so prior. This message was just a simple hello, her letting me know she remade her profile and was back online; we had only ever chatted here and there online nothing serious because I was too afraid to tell her I liked her a lot, the fantasy in my head was to special to risk getting shot down and extinguished entirely; that and she is so beautiful I knew I never had a chance, not with all the other guys online.


I causally responded with a ""thanks for letting me know your cute butt was back online"" I believe that may have been the catalyst that got everything rolling the way it did. It's at this time I will mention that she is from the USA and I am from Canada, but at the time of these exchanges I was in Europe for a couple weeks. We had exchanged the first couple messages when I was staying in a little town in Poland called Dabrowa Bialostocka; translation middle of fucking nowhere with almost zero internet connection. Fast forward a couple days later and I checked into my apartment in Warsaw, first thing I did was get on the internet and shoot her back a message that was cooking in my inbox for a couple days longer that I would have liked as well as added her to Skype, then I went about touring in Warsaw seeing the sites and loving the culture.


My next day in Warsaw I met my cousin who I had never met before, we went to some museums and finished the day with a wonderful dinner at a quiet neighborhood restaurant, after diner he suggested we get to know each other the traditional Polish way, over a bottle of Vodka. We drank until 1 or 2am; after getting properly sauced and getting to know each other he jumped in a cab back home and I had planned to go to bed, but before hitting the hay I checked my iPad really quick to see what my friend back home were getting up too, that's when I opened my Skype to see her online; now I am not sure exactly how the conversation went or how it started but I do remember some key points, at one point I had an argument with myself in my head of course; you ever heard the saying drunk words are sober thoughts? Well I laid it out right there and then I typed simply ""I like you and I have for quite sometime"" there was no response for a minute or two, the tension sobered me up quite a bit as I had come to terms with what I had done, when she responded she said ""really?"" I was devastated, because I took that as a ""really? ewww"" but then she said ""I hope your not joking because I really like you too"".


That sentence hit me like a ton of bricks, it turns out that the whole time I was creeping her page and writing her messages that I deleted before ever sending she was doing the exact same thing. I was in a state of shock because this sort of stuff just does not happen in real life. From there the conversation became very deep and very long; at one point I looked up and it was light outside I checked my clock and it was 5am, I reluctantly told her I had to go and try and get some sleep, after signing off I walked over to the open balcony and looked out over the city, the architecture of Old Town Warsaw bathed in the gold of the early morning sun embraced by the cool summer air. I had never been happier.


We continued to talk online, every word, every sentence brought me an amazing feeling of happiness and contentment. This is when I decided that I wanted to show her that I was not just some chump online, I had already booked a trip to the USA for a conference after I returned from Europe, but I told her that if she wanted I would reschedule my flight to her home town and spend a couple days hanging out in person; she agreed. Lets fast forward a bit to my arrival in Wolfsburg Germany my Polish SIM card would no longer provide me with internet here and I couldn't find a pre-pay data SIM card in Germany so I did the only logical thing, I purchased internet at the hotel I was staying in at a cost of 30 euro a day.


Lets again jump in the time machine and jump forward a couple more days to my arrival back in Canada. I had two weeks of work before my flight to the USA and my anticipation was hitting levels near critical mass; I thought great when I mean her I am going to be a blubbering sweating mess; the closer I got however the more relaxed I felt that was until after landing on US soil and turning my phone on I received a text that said ""I just saw your plane land"" as I walked down the long hallway to the airport terminal people were hurrying past me and I could see them being greeted by loved ones, I walked slower I had a lump in my throat and I was sweating bullets. When I got to the end of the hall I stopped, and that is when I glanced over to my right; there she was standing by the wall looking adorable as can be we locked eyes and froze, I don't have the words to describe the rush of emotions that washed over me but she must have felt it too because there were no words needed between us all we had to do was hug and it was at that moment I recall being at peace with myself and with life. I felt like I had known her my whole life, I shed a tear.


I won't go into much detail about how we spent the next 5 days but it was the time of my life, those days were pure magic, a sense of attraction and belonging I had never felt before. When it came time to leave however; it was much more difficult than I could have ever imagined, by the time I got to her front door I was full on tears and she was close behind, I had never felt emotion so beautiful and so completely devastating as that moment right there knowing in a couple minutes we would be apart. I managed to pull myself together long enough to say a proper good-bye and get into my rental car, but that only lasted until I was out of her driveway; I cried my eyes out the whole way to the airport, not even too sure how I managed to get there, I cried at the check-in desk, at the security check point, at the gate waiting for my plane, the entire plane ride back to Canada and as I sit here typing this right now I am crying at the beautiful memory I am left with.
Never did I think I would feel this way about another person or have them feel this way about me, I was always familiar with crying about being unhappy or lonely never did I think it was possible to cry tears of happiness.

Making a long story short a week or two after I got back home we made plans for her to come visit me and I bought her a plane ticket for December 8th. Although I know I have something amazing to look forward to some nights are hard, and as much as I want to scream from the roof tops how amazing this girl makes me feel I cannot, so instead reddit I scream it to you.

I never really was in love, until last night... This may sound bizzare, but please bear with me.

 The girl I am about to describe is imaginary, I saw her yesterday for the first time in my life.. literally in my dreams. She had long light brown hair with curls in them, she had an athletic figure and was about my age (22). I felt an instant connection, like I have never felt before. The entire dream was just perfect. I remember it felt like having a tornado of butterflies in my stomach, our bond was instantaneously strong, like ive known her my entire life. During this dream we had an incredible time. We were fighting off villains on top of crystal castles, sitting around a camp fire with my best friends. She saved my life a couple of times and vice versa =).

I felt complete and I knew she felt the same way. We hardly exchanged words and when she touched my hand with hers it was like thousands of little needles softly poking my skin.

Don't get me wrong, I am under no illusion that this was all in my mind. I realize that this girl most likely does not even exist and even if she did, who is to say I would ever meet her, let alone talk to her, let alone have the same feelings for her... 

Right after we kissed for the first time the dream began to fade and I woke up. I began to realize that I had just been dreaming, yet the pain I now felt was shockingly real. I immediately had this feeling of dreadful loneliness and despair. Reluctantly I have to admint that I shed a tear or two, fully knowing that I probably will never experience such bliss in real life.

Now, seven hours later my memories are already beginning to fade. I can only find a bit of solace in the idea of somehow meeting this girl again while im asleep. Thinking of which, I cant wait for night to come, for there is a chance I might see her again.

1372931261.0,11,self.love,1hmjir,My story - 19 months and 3 days,Rhiaxxify,12,1,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/1hmjir/my_story_19_months_and_3_days/,"That's how long I have been with my world. 

I'm like most teenager girls, I have insecurities, I'm weird and I need love, affection and attention; that's exactly what I'm getting.

To premise this story, background is needed. Almost 3 years ago, I was in an abusive relationship. To begin with it was mostly just physical, but as the months went on, it became sexual. I was abused for 3 months by someone that was meant to love and care for me. I was still very, very young and I didn't understand the ways of the world so I thought it was my fault. Anyways, I managed to get away after this 'man' tried to rape and kill me.

During these events, I became depressed, anxious and nervous. I've developed manic depression, separation anxiety, social anxiety and I break down at the drop of a hat. I didn't have many close friends at this time because I went to an upstanding private school and I was one of the few weird kids who didn't talk much, so I didn't have anyone to talk to about this 'issue' I was having.

Forwarding to a year later, I started dating one of my closer friends, let's call him Sam, who I met when he came new into the school. He was nice, funny, but distant. When I told him about my incident with my previous boyfriend, he flipped off the rails, completely, and started threatening thin air. At this point, I was still very conscious of when people got mad, angry or raised their hands. So this scared me and I had a breakdown, Sam didn't understand my problems and he basically told me to grow up. Gladly, this relationship only lasted 5 months; I moved schools and our talking time was going down exponentially, so I broke it off.

During the time that I was dating Sam, I met my current boyfriend, who we shall call Jeff. Jeff and I met through our mothers, because I needed people to talk to at my new school and Jeff was attending that school, so our families organised an impromptu dinner for Jeff and I to socialise in a comfortable environment. 

At school we didn't talk much for the first few weeks. I was still having many anxiety attacks and didn't really want to become 'friends' with anyone at that point; I was dealing with self harm/abuse and an eating disorder.

But over social media, like MSN and facebook, Jeff and I started to talk more and more, and at school we started hanging out more and more. I was still in a relationship with Sam though, but not for long. After 5 weeks at the new school I was single and wondering if dating was really worth it. I was dealing with separation anxiety and loneliness. I was talking to Jeff about this, and we got into a D'n'M about how much people can hide without you even having a clue. We talked about the issues we both had, what bad things had happened to him - then he asked me if I was hiding anything. So I told him, I had never trusted anyone like I trusted him, I felt comfortable with opening up. The best thing about this moment is he didn't flip out, much, or make a massive deal of it. He just talked to me, didn't treat me any differently. It made me feel, accepted. 

Soon after, we made a bet to see who could ask the other out first, as I had so foolishly admitted I 'had a slight thing for him'. 

19 months and 3 days later, we're happily together. I don't cut as much any more, I eat properly (mostly), he treats me like a princess and makes me feel like I am the most beautiful person in the world. 

**Tl;dr: Suffering from multiple mental and health issues after abusive boyfriend, I found my new perfect match and he has helped me on the road of recovery. Happy after 19 months and 3 days.**",,False,,t5_2qhnh,False,,,True,t3_1hmjir,http://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/1hmjir/my_story_19_months_and_3_days/,

A month ago i met a very beautiful and smart girl, and needless to say,  i fell in love with her, we met during a school project that lasted 3 weeks, and during this time we got a little confident, but not too much.
Unfortunatley, i found out she is engaged for some years and still interested in him. However i got the feeling, probably wrong cause ""hey, i'm in love!"" that she somewhat likes me, because she smiles everytime we meet, and says ""we are going to meet again, right?"" when i go away (that sounds weird, i know) and made me more compliments than anybody else. But get back to the question:
I have the chance to attend to an university class (we are in high school) about molecular and genetic Biology, and i can bring a person with me. Do you think it'll be ok if i ask her to partecipate? Or it'll be inconsiderate, for she already has a boyfriend? I know she is into this kind of stuff because we talked about that, so it won't annoy her, also her boyfriend doesn't live in the same city as we do, but very near, so they don't meat each other every day, so i have the “long-distance relationship bonus""
Please, help me, i really like this girl and want to be with her more than anything else, and want to stay with her even as a friend, thanks.

Here I am, telling over two thousand people my business. But, that's okay. Because I am (still) in love and I want everyone to know. (Oh and I don't have many friends that can stand hearing me talk about this man anymore.)

Someone PM'd me after I commented about my relationship in another thread. I gave them hope and they made me realize that what I have is a love story. Maybe not the best love story, there has been a lot of heartache over the years, but it is in fact a love story. I am going to copy and paste what I wrote so I don't have to write it out again.

 
&gt;The love of my life broke up with me 6 years ago, he needed to focus on school and it was long distance so it was kind of hard, I was 19 so pretty young, needy and very insecure.
&gt;
I never stopped loving him, but I let him do his thing, what else could I do? I wrote him an email here and there but I rarely got a reply. There were a couple times he would talk to me for a month or so. We didn't talk much for 5 years.
&gt;
Then last January I sent him a message and he answered me. We've been talking for a year now, just as friends. Until the Christmas holidays we got together and talked and he loves me and I obviously still love him. I guess he never knew how much I loved him, or how I've been feeling all these years.
&gt;
So now we are back together. After 6 long years. He's my best friend and I still love him just as much (if not more) than I did in the beginning.
&gt;
My heart still skips a beat when I hear his voice, see his face, get a text or email from him. And I still get butterflies like crazy. Nothing has felt so good than to know that he loves me back.

I left out some very personal things, but that is the gist of it. Oh, and he lives over 4000km away. 

There are no words to explain how I feel inside. I am actually happy. SO happy. 

We may not get to be physically together every day but we still text, phone calls and skype a couple-few times a week. We talk about everything, I have always been honest with him with everything about myself, I tell him my deepest secrets and he's okay with them. He has told me his and I am okay with them, too. 

I don't judge him for anything. I don't hold any grudges. He broke my heart before, but that was in the past, we have both grown so much since then. I don't get very jealous like I have in past relationships. I trust him. I admit that I am human and I do get a little bit jealous over things, but never ever angry at him, and I never hide it, I let him know how I feel. But for the most part, no I am not jealous. 

We have movie dates. Oh how I love watching movies with him. He doesn't talk my ear off or ask me a million questions. My perfect mate. haha. 

Seriously though, he is my perfect mate. I have never been this close to anyone in my life. I don't know if there's such thing as a soul mate, but if there is then he's mine. And I think he feels the same way. 

Don't ever try to make yourself seem like an amazing person, let them know the good and bad sides of you. Don't sugarcoat anything! If they fall in love with who they think you are, they probably won't fall in love with who you really are. 

I have met other people online before and I couldn't ever be myself, and neither could they and it NEVER worked out. But with my boyfriend now, we have always been really open and honest with each other, we think it's kind of crazy actually because we haven't been that way with anyone else. And neither of us can explain why we are like that with each other... except the fact that we're meant for each other. ;)

I have rambled on, but it [feels good](http://i.imgur.com/CohGs.jpg) and I really hope someone reads this. 



**TL;DR - Still kind of long, but whatever - Met a guy over 6 years ago, went to visit him, fell in love (although I knew I loved him before I went to visit him), broke up after awhile, didn't talk much for 5 years, wrote him 1 year ago and he wrote back, we have been great friends the past year (without him knowing how much I still love him), met up with him over the Christmas Holidays and had a few really long talks (shortest was 8 hours), he realized he still loved me, we decide to be back together not long after that, we're still long distance but still madly in love. He's my best friend and the only one for me.**

*Edit: Forgot to mention that we met over the internet, talked for a few months and then I went to visit him in 2005.*

*Edit 2: I also forgot to mention that we both agreed that even if we aren't together or with other people, or together still, we will get married (most likely elope because we are both socially awkward and shy) in 2015! I want to get married before I'm 30. Oh, and he's the only one I've ever been able to imagine myself marrying. I've never really wanted to get married, until I met him.

One day a girl I never knew

Filled my heart like a balloon

It grew so big until one day

It caught the wind and flew away

It met a kite along the breeze

That only wanted to be free

From the strings that hold it down

Suspicious of the solid ground

|

Floating high above the beach

Trembling softly out of reach

With sky above and sea below

A blue balloon in a foreign home

|

The current swept it higher still

Past storms and seagulls, clouds and chills

It swelled with pride, and with a bang

Yelled 'you will not forget me'

And rings that bind your heart

One day a girl I never knew

Filled my heart forever.",,False,,t5_2qhnh,True,,,True,t3_on0ea,http://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/on0ea/in_a_failed_attempt_to_get_over_someone_i_wrote/,

Today I was stuck at home because i was ill. My boyfriend surprised my by telling me he was online any minute and told me to come online too.
When i was on Skype, he wasn't there, so i messaged him 'Where are you?'. Here I am he said, and he walked into my bedroom. He bought me a silver necklace.
It was a present for being strong he said.
The last years I'd had a really hard time, I was harming myself and refused to eat. My uncle became an alcoholic, and a friend of mine died
He was always helped me and without him I'd never made it until now.
Even when i had trouble with my (now ex)boyfriend he helped me out while he actually loved me too. But he wanted me happy so he didn't told. My ex broke up with me and he was there to make me feel better. He didn't used the fact that I became single. Even the times i screamed at him to go away because I desperately wanted to die he stayed. Even if he'd had to stay the whole night. He took me to see so many places, and he really showed me the beauty of life. I want to thank him so much.
I was there for me for two years, and where finally together now.
Last summer we threw a key in the sea together and he said 'by the time we break up, you first have to find this key back, because i locked you up in my heart now..' And then we watched the sunset together.
He is 7 years older but everyone tells us that they couldn't imagine a better couple.

It's not that they're any more or less important to me.
I realize now that they were just distractions from the emptiness I sometimes felt.
That's probably why I didn't care about them when I was with you.
But you're at your place right now and I'm at mine.
And although you're taking comfort in reading, or writing, or cleaning, I'm just sitting where we used to sit.
In front of this dusty coffee table.
Along this old beige couch.

I would come home from work to find you curled up in bed, napping because your medication makes you sleepy.
I remember trying to sneak in and surprise you every time, but you were a light sleeper and my jacket had loud zippers.
The winters here were cold, but you would always expose your skin by lifting your protective shell of blankets and sheets just enough to let me to crawl in.
And although I wasn't sleepy, I was happy to lie next to you.
I loved the way your hair tickled my face, the way you sighed when you pulled my arm around yourself, and how warm you felt even though you always complained about being cold.
So there we were. You, resting and me, gladly wasting daylight.

You would sometimes wake up to me kissing your shoulders and back.
And sometimes that’s what it was.
I whispered thanks to God for making you those other times.

My parents never approved of my girlfriends.
They would always worry about what they wanted in a wife for me.
If she didn’t fit the bill they would tell me to break up with her.
They would try to convince me that we were actually just friends having a bit of fun.
And when I was alone they’d tell me to marry a creation of their own misguided love.

I remember the night you drove me to my parents when I was sick.
They weren’t home, so maybe I should have called first.
When they arrived they asked me how I got there after you left, and where you were after that.
The next morning they listened to me make a long list of all of the things you liked.
Of sweet drinks, and nectarines, and some of my medicine because you were sick too.
They were surprised to see me so active and focused despite my fever.
I considered the supply of the list items, the distances between the stores, and the optimal driving routes to take.
I asked them to deliver the items to your home.
They agreed to my demands, and even packed you some extras.
I think that’s when they realized that I loved you.
They delivered the items and never spoke to me about girlfriends after that.

I still wonder if the nectarines were juicy. They weren’t even in season.

-----

The nights challenge me the most.
Writing and prayer keep me busy, but when my better judgement guides me to sleep I still bring enough water for the both of us to the nightstand.
Last night I woke up at 5:30. I tried, quietly, to creep out to the bathroom so as not to wake you.
I washed my hands and came back to an empty bed.
The blankets you slept under that night were not mine.
Each bottle of water remained capped and standing.
I lied awake and quietly missed you.

Two and a half hours later, I finished breakfast and left for work.
I gave a presentation that morning.
I ate lunch, spoke to you, performed my duties, then came home.
I wrote for a while.
Then I prayed for a while less this time.
And now my better judgement is guiding me to sleep.

My love,

The lamp on my desk is still broken.

I was biking home today trying to swallow all of the tears I had as a result of our chat earlier. It didn’t help that my coworker was leaving. Along the way I opened my mouth for some air and managed to swallow a piece of tree debris because today was very windy and things were being blown in all directions. I thought about how you would have enjoyed how absurd I looked given my situation.

I got home and picked up where I left off: picturing where we’d be a year from now. It’s funny how I’m always looking back into the past when I think about the future.

I’m glad that I’m reminded of the good things we had, and of the moments that we won’t share anymore. My time with you will become a memory and my day will be suddenly become a lot emptier. I have no doubt that, in time, the emptiness will be filled (and with good things, God willing), but you will always occupy a place in my heart. I guess that’s why I’m writing this letter to you right now. I guess it’ll be a list of all the things I don’t want to forget. I also secretly hope that you’ll remember these things too, and miss me every once in a while when you think of them.

Some of these things have been brought up before. You know how fondly I think of them. Like how excited I was to leave work every day so that I could come home to you. You’d be in bed, napping quietly. I would try to sneak in, but the zippers on my favorite jacket were so loud that you would wake up, but sleepily lift up the sheets to welcome me inside anyway..

We’d go shopping sometimes. Now that I think of it, most of our grocery shopping was done together. We’d pick things out and you’d always grab something, decide against it a few minutes later, then leave it somewhere else. It must have given the supermarket employees a story or two to find noodles in the dairy aisle every week.

We’d also cook for each other sometimes. I don’t know why I wasn’t a fan of butter before. I know I’ve had it, but it didn’t taste good until I tried the zucchini you made for me (or was it cucumber? Ha ha). I also couldn’t believe that you weren’t a fan of spicy foods, but I was glad to hear that you were coming around. “I’ll have to like it if I live with you.”

One of my regrets is that I never took good care of my skin. It’s obviously important, but those hot showers and my overall lack of motivation slowly diminished the moisture in me until you came along. I don’t know why I was made without the ability to reach that one spot on my back, but I was so glad that you came along to rub lotion on the places that needed you the most.

I’m also glad that I had you to call when I had bad dreams. You told me that I could call you at any time and you’d come running. I pictured you as Ponyo, hurtling through the air on your magical fish, coming to comfort me as fast as the world would let you. Because Ponyo loves Sosuke and Sosuke loves all the Ponyos. It’s a big responsibility, but he really loves her.

And finally (for now), I’m glad that we fought about the ideologies that we have strong feelings about. We were hurt and upset and I loved you with all of my heart and I know you loved me too. We learned that we shouldn’t worry about ideologies. We just had to worry about love. You’ll never have to wonder if I loved you when we fought. I always have and I always will.

You just sent me a text message, telling me that you’re cancelling on a show we were going to see with our friends, and that you needed some alone time. You told me that you might go out later, and that you’ll call me if you do.

I would give so much to see you right now.",,False,,t5_2qhnh,False,,,True,t3_h884l,http://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/h884l/youve_already_read_these_you_know_how_i_feel/,

Girl moves into our flat and we immediately get along. We drink, watch movies and play games. I sort of had a little crush on her but I told myself not to do anything because she is my flatemate. Anyways, we go out on the town a couple of times and she's all over me. Leaning on my shoulder, holding my hand etc. I still don't act on it. Last Friday she writes on my fb saying 'after work beers at my work?' (she's a waitress) and I think 'fine, it's a cool friendly hangout'.

 I get home and she looks amazing! She is very dressed up and asks me how long it will take to get ready. I shower and put on some nice clothes too and we are off. We arrive at her work and from the instant we walked in it was if she was showing me off to her workmates. Her boss looked me up and down then she whispered in my ear that the bosses like to size up the girls the guys come in with. We try and find a seat and there is a convenient litlle romantic table for two on the balcony. We sit down and she orders us a variety of snacks and heaps of beer (all on her, she insists). Her waitress friends come over and giggle and whisper to her and we all just have a good time. We organize to go to a club with some of them later on. As we drink more and time wears on, her friends started finishing work and joining us for a drink. Soon, she reaches for my hand and we have our fingers interlocked, squeezing affectionately every now and then. The girls mention making a move towards the club when I get a txt from the girl I'm out with saying 'let's just go home and watch a movie'. I txt back yes and after saying our goodbyes we walk to find a taxi. She is under my arm and as we walk she stops and swings into me and we kiss. We get in the taxi and continue. We arrive home and we snuggle up in the couch ready to watch something but we realize we are to drunk and go to her room. We end up sleeping in eachothers arms which was amazing. 

Fast forward a few days of happiness and I get a txt saying we need to talk. Fuck. I greet her as I arrive home and we have a fun night chatting etc. Then she says she is going to bed. I mention the talk and she says 'oh yeah'. She tells me she likes me, but she is not in the right headspace for a relationship. Gutted. I end up being an emo for a few days and head out to a friends birthday party tonight. I start chatting to a girl who soon asks me if we should take the party back to mine and I say... no. It would be awkward having a girl back there with my flattie hearing all thats going on and truth be told, I'm still not over her. I'm drunk so I taxi home and watch a bit of tv. Soon I'm dozing off so I go to the bathroom before heading to bed. As I leave the bathroom I see a shadow of some fucking douche lurking. This guy side steps me and uses the bathroom. I got to my room and soon I hear my flattie getting pounded by this dude. After I turned down a girl. Fuck that and everything about it. I got dressed and went for a walk. It's almost 3.50am and I'm writing this at a bus stop. 

What the hell is going on?!?
I need some kind of words of wisdom!

And for over a year we went to the cinema, dates and dinners as friends. She's never been that usual girly girl, a bit tom boy and likes shit that normal girls don't like. More so, she is a bit defensive and doesn't let anyone get near her.

However over the time i've discovered that this girl is probably the girl I want to spend the rest of my life with. This girl is so perfect that probably there isn't going to be anyone as her who is going to complete me as she does it.

Last month, I've declared to her saying that she i'm so in love with her. She said we were just friends.

Today, after a party that i've went with her, I once again I tried to tell her that I'm really in love with her. This time reality brought pain as friend.

After I've opened my heart to her how perfect she is and how awesome she is, she started explaining to me how even she is unsure of her sexuality. After she explain all of her relationships with woman she started telling me that since she is a grown up she didn't found any love with man. She had casual make out sessions with man but she founds more connection with woman, being that she has only been with one and got interested in another one. I tried to tell her to open her heart to other people, to let people inside her heart. We had such a great chemistry and we could try something, even if for a week. I've tried to hug her, but still the worst part is that, even after that she said that for now we were just friends.

Right now I can't get any sleep. Seriously I've even considered suicide right about now but I doubt I have the courage to even do that. I just wish i could forget ever knowing her. More so I wish I was dead right now. No girl will ever be as perfect as she is and she will always be the mark as I found other girls. My presence in in reality right now has become pointless.

How can God even exist if he is this cruel.

She first messaged me after we got in a few debates together (on the same side (we're both Democrats)). Long story short, she is incredibly beautiful (blonde hair, semi-athletic looking but no longer does sports, could potentially outdrink me (this is a true feat since I am a big man (240 lbs, but only 17% body fat, so not fat)).
Anyway, she comes over about an hour before a party at my place starts. We immediately make some hefty rum and cokes and start talking. About 10 people come and we end up going into my bedroom to continue the conversation and sit in chairs (no, not the bed). As we talk, we get closer, knees touching, hand on leg while laughing sort of thing. She leaves to go get another drink and drags her hand across my shoulder when she leaves.
When she returns we chat for a bit more. Talk about future plans and somehow we got on the large dreams part (involving politics) and I mentioned that I am considering making a run for President after a hopefully successful business career (I'm 22, you have time to prepare America) and she is interested in becoming a high-level energy officianado. So of course I start calling her ""my energy advisor"". She says something witty and I pull her over to my lap and she says ""oh so this is like the Clinton administration?"" and then we proceed to kiss and make out (but sweet and meaningful, not the sloppy kind). I have never had my breath taken away like that before.
Unfortunately she had to leave an hour later to go to her dads for the weekend, but we have a lunch date planned for Tuesday and a date planned for Friday night.
Mind you this is all after I've been single for 2 years and have been avoiding getting in a relationship so I don't have deal with separating because of graduation.

And, naturally, there's this girl. She's 17. I first talked to her a week after my last girlfriend broke up with me. I had already decided not to actively seek anyone, as I finally realised that it would find me. Then - upon thinking this, I suddenly met this girl and got to know her... Over the past three months I've been getting to know her better, I only see her in school but when we do talk it tends to be good conversation. As well as that, she starts conversation sometimes when she's with her friends. I don't like to think I could have such feelings for someone so fast but I truly think I do. She's very musical - like myself. She's pretty much a professional cellist aged 17, and I a pianist. I feel like we'd fit well both as people and musicians but I have this constant underlying fear that i'll ask her for coffee or something someday and either we'll get close and then it won't work out or she'll just reject me entirely. I told a couple of friends about it and they said they'd see what they thought, and after assessing her body language and other things around me, they said I should go for it. Every time I see her I mean to ask her but it genuinely slips my mind and all I can feel is the butterflies in my stomach. She truly is the most elegant, beautiful human being I ever have known. I don't feel like I'm at the stage yet where we could really classify ourselves as really good friends but I feel such a strong bond with her that could just grow exponentially for eternity... I guess, what I'm attempting to say is... Should I go for it? Apologies for not shortening down this spiel my fellow redditors. ^.^

Still nothing and I was just laying there thinking about random stuff. Then this song came on and I had the most amazing dream I've had in a long time. I guess this girl who's a really good friend of mine and that I really like were staying in a big house with her family for the week end or something cause it started with me coming from outside, looking her in the eyes, putting my had out and saying come on, I want to show you something. And this wasn't a house in the city either, but also not in the woods. It was just.... There. Anyways she looks back at me in a kinda surprised look but takes me hand and I tell her to close her eyes. Then I lead her outside to a bridge with a calm river going under it and tell her to open them. She does and she's taken back in awe at the night sky. It was just beautiful and we both love astrology which made it even better. We were standing there looking into the sky and then we both looked at each other with out words and kissed.
The song was lullaby (produced by Tedder, prickett &amp; kutzle) by onerepublic. Sorry I couldn't find a good YouTube video of it.

Also if someone wants to make a picture of it I would really appreciate it and I listed more details bellow.
Details:
Bridge was a round, hump type bridge.
The water below had a violet reflection but there wasn't really a direction it was coming from, just that it had a violet reflection on it.
A lot of the stuff on the ground(plants, some dirt, ect) was glowing kinda like the movie avatar.
Idk how else to explain the sky other than is was just a beautiful night sky that I've only seen in pictures since I live near a big city, I'll include a picture of the closest it looked like.

My situation has not been improving

Though your body is not here the memories remain

And for me this is way to moving

---

I saw you first some ages ago and 

Fell flat from the first moment

For three years I walked with you

But you would not return it

----

Then one day as I walked by your side

You suddenly walked by mine

And all the joy came crashing through

My walls of sadness as divine

----

By each others sides we built our lives

Together we would not be stopped

We had our problems and many a fight

But nothing would separate our top

----

I worked so hard and improved for you

I threw away my very self

I wanted to be your perfect man

So you wouldn't put me on the shelf

----

Through years and years I thought and though

With you there was always something new

With all my reason and rationale

I figured this had to be true

----

Then one day you decided

That you needed something more

I understand, I'm not much of a man

But it still left me so sore

----

The first weeks I spent crying alone by myself

I couldn't face the world

For I gave you my all and now I am empty

A husk of nothing but hurt

----

I need to get out and I need to go away

For we did and saw everything together

Now you are gone but the memories remain

And alone I cant go however

1353493616.0,9,self.love,13k70w,"Have you ever fallen in love online?

Here's my story. ",Hopelesslyenamored,10,1,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/13k70w/have_you_ever_fallen_in_love_online_heres_my_story/,"So, I'll start off by saying that about a year and a half ago I was bored and downloaded a crazy chat app from an App Store. 

It randomly paired you with a person after you have entered certain criteria. 

To make the story shorter, I was paired with a guy.  We talked a lot that first day. Then it continued. Everyday. 

Sadly he and are are on completely different continents. So it makes it difficult to meet (we haven't yet, but planning on it in the near future.)

We have an awesome connection. We like the same things. We have the same goals. But as in any relationship, we've hit a few kinks along the way. 

During one of those kinks we actually stopped talking. Rather he stopped talking to me because of a girl he had met in his country. 

I was in love with him but didn't tell him because I was terrified of love. I still am. But I was more afraid of loving someone so much, who I haven't even met in person. 

He finally told me what was going on and I stupidly told him then, at the worst possible time that I loved him. He asked why I hadn't told him sooner. 

He had found someone else because he thought I wasn't interested. That relationship lasted less than a month and we were committed to being just friends to give his new relationship a chance to grow.  It didn't last very long. Can't say that I was very sad about that though. 

This is where my big mistake came in. After this episode, I became Rey jealous. Possessive. Needy. I was afraid of losing him again. This definitely wasn't my proudest moment. We fought a lot. 

We continued our amorous relationship after that. Fast forward 6 months and he starts acting weird. Not Answering messages. Even evading me. 

Eventually I had given up on him. I moved on. Tried a relationship with another guy. But that didn't work out. 

Then out of the blue, a couple of months after we had gone separate ways he sent me an email. Told me that he had met another girl and felt like a jerk so he evaded me. Thought ignoring me would be better than telling me the truth. 

I had done a lot of growing up during the time we didn't speak. I was more sure of myself. I told him I forgave him and that I did miss my best friend. 

We talked a lot in the next days. He finally told me he hadn't gotten over me and that he missed what we had. I still loved him, I just refused to tell him. I didn't want to be hurt again like I had been. 

Finally one day I decided I had had enough of hiding my feelings for him. Not telling him what I felt for him almost made me lose him once. I wasn't about to let it happen again.

I told him I loved him. He said that he had been giving me space and time to decipher my feelings and that he too loved me more than he could explain in words.

This is technically our third go around at this in one and a half years. I love him more than anything and I have learned to trust him again. He expresses his love to me daily and I do the same. 

We've both grown matured significantly and realized we want this relationship to work out. We don't fight and speak regularly on the phone. 

So after this long story Reddit, do you believe long distance online love can exist and flourish? And have you ever fallen in love with someone online in a different country, and did it work out?

Please, I will need your help /r/love.",Draedgal,12,2,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/11ypqw/its_like_i_am_the_most_unexperienced_people_in/,"Hello,

I'm a guy who has 16 years old (Crow in the sky, no I didn't say anything bad), living in France [and I was born there], and... Well fuck, I wanted to post this in weeks, I'm gonna do it before I go to the hospital (nothing to worry about, just wisdom tooths removed, gonna be a *hamster*).

So, let's begin my dear redditors ! 

I know a girl since last year. We were in the same english class [remember remember, I'm living in France, this isn't the same~], and I think..; But not sure (who cares now ?) she was looking at me several times. And now I remember, it was the first time I taked my courage in my hands and spoken to this beutiful girl (to me, she is. Really. Really. Beautiful...). A year passed, and I was kind of intersted in her all the year, trying to know her, have meet's up *[am I saying that right ?]*, and speak for hours. And Odin was a witness, I think the most beautiful day was a sunny day, a whole afternoon I passed with her. All alone. In the park, mostly. Was awesome. I wanted to hold her in my arms. I asked if I could... Yes we were hugging for less than a minute, but it was the first time I was hugging someone else that my family members. I miss a lot of details, sorry.

I do have a miscunception of friendship, mayby. Or mayby not, I just can't have friends ? But that's a whole another subject.

The school year ended early in June, and the last text she sended to me was ""sorry"" *(stupid story). I replied harsh, and I did regret it. At the end of the big vacations I texted to her a long text. She accepted my sorry as I did the same. But mine wasn't the same as her, mine was really a bad thing to do. And if she read this, sorry about that... Again.

I'm really happy to see this girl every weeks, even if this is some seconds (hello - how are you - how was your week-end - goodbye). The only true conversation was when we meeted-up last tuesday. Damn was a great hour with her... I was happy. Happy... I was happy. *No brain, don't make me cry now please.* We're not all that hippy and tripping, we are just good as we are, don't care about what others says etc. And I love what is all classy and stuff... And swing music, I like swing music. And jazz, but not so much... But I love progressive house, eletro-house, drum'n'bass, and... What... Others. I enjoy instrumentals more than voices. Still don't know what she likes.. I will ask her now then. Edit will come.


It will be a week that we are now sending a new form of texts that I never expected. Hearts ! And cute surnames (She is calling me *hamster* because of the operation tomorrow)... Don't you find owls beautiful ? Spiders lovely ? We do. So... What could I say more... I fell in love. Yes. I wasn't sure but... Now I am. Oh Thor. I feel so shy now...

After the vacations (I am now, thanks to that Hamster operation), tuesday, I would like to ask her to be my girlfriend. I was wondering about how I could do it. Take her hand when we are alone and ask ?
So... What do you think about all of this ? Do you need further explications ? Sorry, I typed it without thinking too much. Will answer your questions in comments if you want to ask... 

**TL;DR** : I can't do a TL;DR since you could need the ""story"", sorry... 

**TL;DR** : All right. I love a girl and don't know how to ask her. 

___

Love you reddit ♥

But anyways let me get started.

So it was about three years ago, it was the beginning of summer i was skateboarding with some friends, I noticed my friend witch we called matsa was texting someone so I asked who it was. Yes i was a bit nosy back then, but she responded with jade. And i just fell in love with the name. So joking around i said tell her I said hi and she did so she said hi back and told me to text her sometime. So I got her number from matsa and finished the day of, I went home and texted her for the first time. We got along just fabulously she was kind, smart, beautiful and just all around a lovely person. So the summer went by and we kept talking and talking and we found that we had a lot in common, well after that it was the same throughout the school year. So summer came again and by then we were the best of friends we'd always be texting and talking but we never met. So I believe it was about midsummer when I was playing MW2 I started to become a gamer, anyways as usual we were talking and she said i'm in love. me by then was completely madly in love with her. So me thinking it was someone else but not wanting to tell her said ""oh?"" ""with who?"" and she responded ""with you"". I felt such excitement such joy so much love i started to cry. But it was only then that I remembered we were moving away to mexico. So I asked my mom if she would take me to see her before we did and she said this to me when we arrived to mexico, she said she saw such depression and love in my eyes she couldn't say no. so one week before we left we drove to her house so we could see each other for the first time ever. And it was like heaven on earth we kissed so passionately when our lips first touched I swear my knees gave out and when we hugged neither of us let the other go for about 15 minutes. I never wanted it to end I just wanted to hold her in my arms forever and ever. But the day came to the end, a week went by and it was 2 days before we left and my mom said ""i'm going up north if you'd like I can drop you of at jade's house"" of course I said yes. So when i arrived her mom and brother were gone, and my mom left so we went in her room started to watch a movie. Well we started kissing and one thing led to another and well we made passionate love. We were young and in love, When it was time for me to go I remember we were standing at her door holding each other and she started to cry. I kissed her on the forehead and said don't cry i love you we'll be together again someday, she hugged me so tight and i her. I got in the car and drove of and started to cry. My mom stopped the car and said go say the last goodbye. As soon as jade saw me get out of the car she ran towards me and I to her. We kissed and cried and finally said goodbye. 
Now that im in mexico we talk via text message since she's never really online and i just miss her it's been three years and i just havent moved on or thought about dating, i just cant i love jade i hope we can be together some day again.
I love you jade.

Quickly we became really good friends, and he asked me out after about 1-2 months of knowing him. I liked him at that time, but so did my friend... so I declined. Then I went away for the summer and when I got back, he went off to camp. So the two of us didn't talk for about two months. When we started talking, we became best friends. He knew everything about me, and I knew everything about him. He knew the reasons I turned him down even though I liked him, and he told me that he was in love with me. Everyone said that we should go out, and many  people said that we were best friends who were dating but wouldn't admit it. On 11/11 he came over and it was really nice. It was one of the perfect moments in life, one that I would do anything for again. After summer to New Years Eve, he was perfect and I fell in love with him. This was the first time I've fell in love, and the first time that he fell in love was with me as well. On New Years Eve, I told him that I still really liked him (even though I knew he wasn't going to say yes -- but I needed the closure of everything). He said that it could never work out because he was too afraid to lose/hurt me and that we both needed to move on with our lives. Afterwards, things were a little awkward, but that was expected. Then  we just started ignoring/avoiding each other. We didn't talk, and tried to see each other as little as possible, even though all of our friends were the same and we had lunch together every day. He was being more of a jerk, and I was being really distant with everyone. Finally (about a month later), we got together and sat down and talked. We said how we needed to figure out a way to become civil with each other and hopefully friends. It's been a month since then, and even though its less avoidance, we still do not talk or hang out. I miss my best friend. I have moved on in the sense of, I understand that we will never date and I am fine with that. I have also realized that he has a lot of flaws that I knew before, but over looked. I want my best friend back, the guy who I can tell everything to. He was my first REAL best friend, the first person who I would trust with my life. 

This was the first time that I opened my heart. I spent all my life sheltering my heart, because I was too afraid to get hurt. And that ended up hurting me... A part of me will always love him, just because we never got the chance to see what we would have been like together. I will always love him, but I am no longer in love with him. However, I do want him back as a best friend. I just want him back to be someone who I talk to on a daily basis. And someone who I can tell everything to. We use to be able to talk hours on end... and now its hard to keep a few minutes of conversation.

She and I discovered a kind of love I had never experienced or imagined before, and finally ending it with her without looking back (we had broken up and gotten back together numerous times throughout 2010) was the hardest thing I ever had to. But I did it because the relationship had destroyed our individuality, we were both unhappy, and I'm glad I did it. It was the right thing to do.

I've spent every day since then as a single man, investigating who I am and what makes me happy. I've worked harder on myself in the last year than I ever remember doing before. I got in shape, got a great job, learned how to organize my time, started reading a lot and writing in journals to organize and keep track of my thoughts, in general I've taken control of my life on a completely new level. I do everything I can to be an honest reflection of the person I want to be. This lifestyle makes me extremely content with my life, but I am more than content, for the last couple months, I have consistently been the happiest I have ever been in my life.

I've been feeling this way because of the most important thing I've done in the last year- I started loving myself. I love the person I am and the person I want to be. I accept my strengths and my flaws, I trust myself completely, I approve of my own actions, and I do my best everyday to love myself and others as the people we are at the moment. I've been feeling the unconditional love for everyone and everything flowing out from me in every direction, and I came here to tell you all that I love you, and I'm so happy for you if you feel this same happiness because it is truly one of the beautiful things in life.

Hi Reddit!

I want to tell my boyfriend that I feel like I could marry him. I am immensely in love with him and I want to spend my life with him and no one else. I think he feels the same way but you never really know for sure without asking. We're in our mid twenties, and have been together a little less than a year.  Yeah we have some milestones to pass and we're young still and yada yada, but I've never felt such a feeling with such intensity as the love I have for this man, and the desire I have to be there for him for the rest of my life and have him by my side for the rest of his. I know women think about this a lot more than men do, and especially in our mid twenties. We get baby/marriage fever sometimes. Especially if friends are getting married or have kids.

I should mention that we casually mention ""our"" marriage/kids in conversations at times and neither of us get awkward or uncomfortable upon its mention.

So my question, readers of reddit, is should I bring this feeling up to him? Should I tell him I feel so strongly for him that I don't want anyone else ever again? Should I wait till more time passes and just keep my mouth shut? Or should I wait for him to bring it up?

**Edit: Update: Yeah, I think I'll wait. You guys are all right. Thanks Reddit! :)**

I'm a freshman in college. I met this girl orientation day, and my jaw hit the floor the first time we talked. We hit it off really well. We became great friends quickly. As is the nature of these things, I fell for her and I fell hard. I've never loved anyone- yes, *loved*, as much as I have her. I'm not a lovestruck kid. I've had experience dealing with these things. Here's the problem. We met in July. It's January. I've told her, and this is what she told me:

*  She isn't ready now. She has a lot on her plate, and a relationship would make it tougher. On top of that, she just got out of a really bad relationship around the end of high school. She still needs time to get over that. 

* The next thing she said was that she'd been in ""this situation before,"" and ended up hurting her best friend.

* That it doesn't ""just happen."" I'm not sure what that really means. She then said that feelings don't appear instantaneously.

* I asked, ""What would it take to happen? She said that it wasn't anything on my part: that I was the nicest, cutest, smartest, funniest, most ""mellowest"" guy she'd ever met. But that relationships just didn't pop up.

I want to share the weird ride I've been on for the past few weeks, so please bear with me...  

    




I'm 27 (male), she's almost 28, and we've only been seeing for a few weeks at this point, and yet... I think she might be the one!  
 

    

    

I'll start my story with a little history -  

I've always been a little shy and sometimes socially awkward. I've always had good friends, but had a really hard time approaching girls. This changed quit a bit in the last few years, due to some change in atmosphere (different circle of friends, different personal focus), and largely thanks to my first serious relationship, at the age of 26 (I've had GFs before, but nothing that lasted more than 2-3 months). 

This last relationship lasted about a year, and was terminated by me, because it got a little too much for me. We were already living together at my old apartment, about to move to a bigger one, and my Ex started using ultimatums to get me to marry her. This, along with some long-held doubts I already had, led me to the decision to leave and look for ""real love"". I wanted to find a relationship where I would just know ""this is it, she's the one"", rather than making a rational decision to ""do the right thing and settle down""...  

    



One more thing to note about me is that I pretty much wrote the book on self-control and rational reasoning. I tend to use my rational decision making skill for 99% of the choices I have to make, and very very rarely do my emotions get to lead the way. I have been seeing a therapist for about six moths now, regarding this issue (among others), and we've been making some progress.  



    

Now back to my story - 

It's been a little over 3 months since that relationship ended, and I've gone on a quite few dates in that time. It was enough to boost my confidence somewhat, and I did have a few good experiences along the way, but it's not something I'd like to make into a habit. 

    

Enter my new love - 
Basically, this girl entered my life like most of my recent dates - brief online flirts, then a few phone calls, followed by a face-to-face date. 
I could already tell she was cool and open minded from our online interactions, and I was happy when she didn't show any signs of disapproval when I shared my appreciation for the geeky side of life (there was a big scifi con where I live at the time, and I wanted to share my experiences).  

When we had our first date, I was just smitten - she was gorgeous, interesting, and simply better than I expected on every parameter...  To be honest, I was just flattered she entertained the idea of dating me...  

One thing that kind of hurt my outlook on our chances was that there was absolutely no physical contact, hand holding, etc. on that date (mostly due to my fear of rejection). I called her the next day, expecting to get denied a second date, but try I did - AND SHE SAID YES!  
Our second date was unbelievably awesome, and I really went all out - I got her a rose, took her to the best restaurant I could find, and made an effort to be romantic. That date ended with a kiss, and I was as happy as I could be.  
From that point on, something within me changed. I don't let her on to this too much yet, and whenever we're together I can keep my cool, but when I'm on my own it's as if I'm a 15yo schoolgirl with a crush. I can't stop daydreaming, and my emotions pretty much run me. I went from showing and having next to no emotions, to having full-on, deep feelings, and even the occasional tears of joy when I'm on my own...  

     

I know how crazy this sounds, but I think this girl will someday be my wife! This is the very first time I really saw myself marrying someone, let alone having these ideas so early on.  


      

On the rational side of things, all the technical requirements seem to be fulfilled - 

We're attracted to each other, we have some common interests, we get along fairly well, we're both at an age where that is a valid option in a few years, and I think we both played the field enough to be ready to commit when the time comes. 



      

on the emotional side, there's just no denying what I'm feeling, even though it's surely closer to the realm of an infatuation than deep love, at least at this point...



      

Reddit - what are your thoughts?  



    
    

TL;DR - After a lot of hardship, I met an amazing girl, which I hope to marry one day, even though we have only been seeing each other for a few weeks.

We've become really good friends (and I know she thinks so too) - I really do like her, and I feel the way to ""take it to the next level"", is by telling her this very thing. I'm afraid I might otherwise loose her after the summer, because we just finished the same school, so the next year we won't be seeing each other a whole lot.

I believe that she likes me too, however it's like we both pretend there's nothing more to it. We usually take a walk at parties together, where we hold hands or similar. But as soon as we near the party again from our walk, we automatically stop touching each other, and pretend it never happened. She did though, take my hands quite a few times at the party, where we sat at a table talking with each other, but also other people. However, still so that nobody could see it. This was all a few days ago, so I asked her if she'd like to take a walk with me yesterday, she agreed. However, this time, even though we were alone, we didn't hold hands or anything. Could this be a sign, she has lost interest? But on the other hand - the last time it ended well, nothing odd happened in between. Or could she just be shy?

So yes, we are seeing each other again soon, at a minor event. I planned on taking her to the nearby beach (about 5-10 minutes walk), sit down, tell her that I really enjoyed the last couple of months where we have been together a lot, as well as feeling happy when I'm around her. So in conclusion, that I like her. And hope to get the same thing back, and move from there. (Should I kiss her, if she says the same thing? I'm pretty sure she hasn't been REALLY kissed before. She's not someone who just takes any guy.) If it's relevant, we're both around 16.

Any advice on this? Should I tell her in another way? And could she have lost interest already, because of the signs she showed on the night walk, or would you think she's just shy?

Let's name the guy robert. I have known Robert for about 3 years now and only started really talking now that I have picked up a job at the same place he works. Robert hasn't asked for sex, or anything dirty like that, and he feels the age thing is weird too. We haven't done anything with each other and I honestly have no idea if what I'm doing or feeling is morally correct. The only outside piece of advice I got was from a friend that is older then me, and she said, ""you never know unless you try and if you want to give it a try be careful because you don't want to get in trouble.""

My family has all throughout my my upbringing had very close relations with this other family, having spent almost every holiday together. I have been spending time with this girl since we were both in diapers, and her family is pretty close to what I would consider family.

Over the last several month, we have been spending increasing amounts of time together, not for any particular reason other than enjoying eachothers company, and both being in a very similar situation in live. Both being single, early thirties and a very similar outlook on life. 

Im scared by the fact that im sensing a growing affection for her in me. One one hand, I know this girl extremely well, and think we would make a great couple, and on the other hand, I wouldnt want to loose her, or her family.

I do think she is feeling the same way. The last few times we have been together has all been at parties, and we the two of us have almost exclusively talked to each other and ignored just about everyone else. There has been touching with hands on thighs etc, and deep intimate conversations, while both have been stearing well clear of anything resembling relationship talks. I know I have been scared at least.

I feel like I should tell her, as there is definently something there. I havent been this infatuated by a girl in years and I think about here just about waking hour now.

A few years ago I met this girl, lets call her Sasha, after a while Sasha and I got together. Non of my friends approved but of course I didn't listen. I was happy and thats all that mattered to me. Graduation came and we decided to do the long distance thing (mainly me taking a bus and a train to see her, 3hr trip). Then one time that I went to visit her she told me she didn't want to be with me. Not only that but that I annoyed her, she would rather spend time with her friends, horrible at sex and basically everything you could imagine. I was completely heart broken. I thought Sasha and I were going to be together for a long time. I cried my eyes out weeks after that. My self-esteem went completely down and just kept thinking that no one will ever love me. Time passed and thankfully my friends were there to pick me up. They took me out to kickboxing, soccer and to the clubs just to keep my mind off her. They would tell me all the bad things they saw on her and after a while I realized that they were right I just didn't see it because love blinded me. I didn't realize I was being verbally abuse by her until we broke up. 

After a while I was able to start dating again and thats when I met her, lets call her Sam. Sam and I got along really well from the start. We started to spend more and more time together and finally on new years day I asked her to be my girlfriend and with a big smile she said yes. However, I was still feeling insecure so at first we weren't having sex but that only made things better, since sometimes sex does complicate things. One night when I was holding her in my arms I started to think how horrible I felt when I was with my ex since she would always put me down and how happy I was feeling holding Sam and simply being with her. Sam and I bake together and joke around and she always makes me really happy. It was a huge difference and honestly while I was holding Sam one night a tear came out. A tear of pure joy. Sam didn't notice I simply kissed her forehead and she hold me tighter. Now all I want to do is thank my ex for breaking up with me, if she wouldn't have i would have met Sam. &lt;3

PS When Sam and I started to have sex we had sex every night and every morning (2 to 3 times) for the next 3 days. She said my name and ""oh my god"" every time. What my ex told me only made me try harder and now Sam is benefiting from that.

I suppose I'll tell my story..

I met this girl during school, let's call her Kaitlin, who almost immedately captured my attention. I went a very long time without ever being able to man up and ask her out. One day I finally managed to work up the courage to talk to her. I asked her out, and she denied me, something about just not wanting a relationship. Things went silent between us for quite some time after that, a little over a year. Over time she began to come out of her shell to me a bit more, I still had a moderate-to-severe crush on her, so I was secretly excited beyond belief. But being somewhat of a pessimist at the time, I had convinced myself that she was just trying to befriend me and had no interest in me in the romantic sense. After a separate failed relationship and me growing more and more enamored with her, everything was thrown onto the table. She had told me how she despised my ex for getting to be with me, and subsequently hurting me, and that she always had a crush on me as well. At this point we lived nearly an hour's drive away from each other, so we could only communicate via phone and text. This didn't stop my feelings from growing as we talked more and more. Kaitlin eventually just said to me, ""I love you,"" and that was it. From then on she had a spell cast over me, I could never bear to imagine myself as being with anyone but her, I loved her like I didn't know I was capable. Things were great for a while, I talked to her for hours on end every single day. Until without warning, and through EXTREMELY indirect means, she told me she no longer liked me, and stopped speaking to me. After crying myself to sleep that night, I started a downward spiral, I was practically incapable of any real emotion; I had been completely numbed by the loss of her (Though I hid it quite well most days). For a long time I just didn't know what to feel as I went through the motions at school. It wasn't until months later that I heard from Kaitlin again; this time she was much more confident during our conversations, but I was far too ecstatic to notice. I found myself trying to find an excuse to talk to her every single day, and she seemed fine with this, but any time I brought up what she meant to me, how I wanted to be with her, she would always say the distance was just too much; essentially blowing me off whenever possible. After the end of yet another doomed relationship, I began chasing her harder than I ever had before, leading up to a particularly painful night, leaving me in tears once more. A dear friend of mine convinced me to tear myself away from Kaitlin, It wasn't until months later that I realized how poorly she had treated me. I still think of her nearly every day, but looking back I'm glad I broke free.

Even though I'm in my late 20s, I had never entertained the notion of marriage. I have even turned down two proposals. But, my current significant other is just... *sigh* ....wonderful for me. 

So, I now fantasize ALL THE TIME about getting married. It's harmless, I don't ever pressure him about it, and it makes me smile. But, I've begun looking at rings, and I've peaked at a venue or two... even signed my name with his surname to see what it looked like.

There are things you don’t say aloud. I mean, you trust your friends and tell them your feelings towards others, that’s cool. But then, inside, it’s like a sea of emotions. You’re confused but happy at the same time. You don’t know what you think at some points but then at others, everything seems natural. 
The point is, you can’t fully explain your feelings in person. Sometimes, it’s an action, a sign, a gift, and it just says anything and everything you’ve ever wanted t say to that person. Sometimes, you don’t have the guts to do anything. It may be because you’ve been hurt in the past or you’re just afraid. 
But I urge you, with every cell and emotion and thought, do something about it. There’s no point listening to love songs and wishing it was you. There’s no point reading fairy tales and dreaming up your prince charming. Because one day you’ll look back and the regret will be horrible, it will overwhelm you. You’ll be forever wondering. 
For example, I found a guy. He was a friend, we joked, mucked around, but we were just friends. I began to like him but was afraid. Then he moved. Looking back at that, the crying and the anger and the hoping for something to happen, well, it was useless. I should’ve done something; he was one of the guys I got along with the most, had the most in common with. I let him go.
So don’t do what I did. Yes, this is one of the clichéd messages ever given but it is one of the truest.

A really special someone, to see themselves, someone I recently introduced to Reddit, and while she may not understand it yet, maybe this will help her understand something else. Here is some stuff about our friendship.
So, I am currently a young guy, a year 10 in a south Australian school. But the story starts much earlier, year 8.
I started out without many friends, keeping to myself. and I eventually became friends with a guy named Tim, he was what you would call the ""funny, attractive, popular guy"" that each class would have, and we had science.
Walks in a girl, who is she I ask myself? I wouldn't have a clue. I go back to being a moron, playing with fire. Whats this? the new girl knows the people next to me, and she seems to find our reckless endangerment humorous.....and I kick into showoff mode.
I later on learn through others this girls name is Kaitlen (cute name?) and she had moved here from another high school. Did I want to be her friend? I didn't know. All I did know was that she was really pretty, red hair. Beautiful eyes. flowing body, and a soft,relaxing,calming, and hypnotic voice.
Luckily I am friends with two girls who already knew her, and this gives me a basis to introduce myself, and we talk, ever so slightly I feel that maybe this girl is special, But I'm a year eight. I am fairly stupid at this time. yet none the less we talk. and my feelings develop as well. around 9 weeks into knowing her, after lying to her, saying I liked someone else in our class. it just comes out ""I like you alot"" and the time after is kind of a haze.
Stuff like.....I like you...but my dad says no came about.....and I was spun into sadness. spiralling out of control. I felt incomplete if I wasn't talking to her. Yet I found myself growing apart from her. and only half a year later, I learn that her, still liking me was a lie, that she did it for my own good, because she did not want to hurt me. This killed me a little inside. I found it hard to deal with. and so, in approximately November, I was crushed. Scrolling through Facebook, there is was, Kaitlen, is in a relationship, with who you ask? Scott, someone who I was on good terms with at the time( this event.....had us growing apart it would seem)
I began my regime. I am happy for you I said, and for a time it was true, then I began to feel bad talking to her, that he may grow jealous. So I stopped. I grew sad every moment I saw them together. But what could I do.
February,2011. They are still together, happy. I find myself holding my own someone in my arms,for a mere month, before I realise it isn't real. that I am protecting myself, it ends, and again I am all alone. But then, so is she. Her feelings for Scott have died, and my hope rekindles in a sense. over the following year our friendship grows deeply. While we don't see each other out of school. We text and communicate in any way possible. All I can ask myself is... why can it not be? why can't we be the nuclears. A perfect match? far from it I fear. The closer we grow the more I grow.....into a fool, blinded. and......again I declare my feelings for her, ever so blatantly. An apology rolls off her tongue, yet again. and yet and yet again.
Out of nowhere. we find ourselves no talking. and then after many a month. school ends, and again we find Facebook and texting has become our primary source of contact.....and I do not have those feelings for her, I want to be her friend ( I think as much).
School begins, 2012. We are now both 15. getting older. We have two classes together, sose and English. We talk,laugh. We grow yet again closer, and I repress feelings that I fear may come up yet again(because they have ruined it before) and we become best friends. And then. It is my birthday party, I am turning 16. for me, a time of loud music, drinking and friends. She is coming, of course. and I dress up, as does she. I in a black suit, and her in a rather dapper red dress. Ever so elegant. Most definitely the best and only girl exciting me that night. I attempt to slow my drinking in order to share the time with her, she must leave early you see. and during this time, we move alone into the lounge room of my house, and sit together (in my mind, wanting to give her a quick peck, but how does she feel?) we share a moment....my head tipsily resting on her shoulder, and I feel time stop, could I spend the rest of my life like this? I wanted too. and as quick as it began, it ended. My ex girlfriend was there, and once kaitlen left........Mistakes were made. and i live now to regret them. I betrayed myself. my feelings for someone of an actual worth to me. She then learnt of this, hugged me, and told me it would be okay, would it be?
A girl, a friend of the both of us. Nikki, offers to come with me to a sexual health place. I wanted to be checked, and so did she. we then went ahead and arranged it. and on our walk to this place. my friends see's the way Kaitlen and I text. 2500 messages over the last month. She says we are cute together. and that we should get back together! i correct her and tell her, we were never together. but my heart sinks.....why did i have to say that, what if it were all different. I realise the shitty truth. It has always been there. suppressed and repressed by other thoughts, and emotions. FUCK! two days later, i am baking brownies and texting her. She loves brownies? how would she like some? she says yes. so i make my way to her home, a short journey. and give her some. Yet another chance to see her, i will not complain. She is happy, and enjoys them. I then return home, and go on Reddit, and minutes later find myself writing the very words i am now typing. I wish tomorrow would yet come sooner, so i can see her again, and say "" hey kaitlen, check Reddit. "" and see her face warp in recognition of what i typed the night before.
This next part is for her alone.
Dear Kaitlen. Life over the last three years has been the greatest and worst time of my life with you. The sad times.........they are sometimes about you, as you may recall. florence and the machines, ""happy for what i have, and sad for what i do not"" yeah....all about you. I know we are best friends, like a brother and sister. but im sorry, we can and always will be friends, the best of them i hope. but i will always have feelings for you, even if you never will, its an undying hope that i grasp onto tightly, time spent with you, is the only time worth spending. and i apologise for nothing in advance. this is my mind, and i thought this was an appropriate way to say everything i wanted too. and while saying this to you in person would have indeed been better. this is how i have chosent to do this. and yeah.
You are beautiful, my best friend, my world , my soul, and my breathe. I long for the day when you may say the same. but fear i may die before it comes, and Kaitlen, thankyou for taking the time to read this.

I won't mention what religion I am, but it is one that actively discourages relationships with non-believers. My father is a religious leader in this religion and my entire family and almost all my friends are fervent believers. 

Here is my dilemma. I think I have fallen in love with someone not within my religion. In the past I have mostly distanced myself from people I might find attractive outside of my religion in order to avoid this kind of issue. I don't know why I didn't this time. Either way I have no idea what to do. I feel like it'll be very painful to stay away from this guy now that I have fallen for him. He has been nothing but sweet and wonderful to me. We've discussed our futures together (as friends of course- although he has given signs that show his interest) and our humour clicks very well. He is honestly just so incredibly wonderful. Sorry I will stop ranting about him. 

I know my parents will be incredibly disappointed and try to make me stay away from this guy if anything occurs. In the one time I slipped up in the past (fell for a non-believer - who also fell for me) which was in high-school, they took away my internet, my phone and any other way of contacting him. I was not allowed to see anyone for months. They then pressured me lie to him and say I no longer had any feelings for him. He was heartbroken. I haven't been able to apologize to him because he has moved away. 

I don't want this to happen again. 

I know all my religious friends will also disapprove of me and try to (more gently) turn my mind. Even if they are not extreme like my parents they will definitely have an issue with me. 

I don't know what to do. I'm so confused right now. Should I try and distance myself from this guy? Is there something I can say to my parents? 

Thankyou if you read this.

To become everything they desire and more,

Just another sucker, building pedestals for whores.

Hopelessly awaiting the next toxic kiss,

My first time in love. I tried to prevent myself from falling too fast, but 5 months after we began, before leaving for Christmas break, I knew it was a certainty. So when I went home to the family, I began planning what to say when I got back. Unfortunately, the time apart wasn't enough for me to organize my words, so I decided to write him a love letter. The cheesiest love letter ever. I returned to him on December 30th. He greeted me at the airport, kissed me, held me, and told me he missed me. I gave him his present, but held onto the card a little longer. I was already losing my nerve. I was afraid that he wouldn't feel the same, and I was so close to shredding the card and forgetting the whole thing. One thought stopped me. Even if he didn’t love me, surely he was close. I remembered the petnames he called me, especially “mi amor” (my love). Surely that meant something. I held onto those memories and promised myself I wouldn’t chicken out.

New Year’s Eve. December 31st, 2010.

We slept in late so that we would be able to stay awake the whole night our friend's party. I told him that I had to go home to my own apartment so that I could shower and get ready. I put the note on his bed and left, to let him open it and read in my absence.

When I returned, he greeted me at the door, kissed me, held me, and told me that the letter was beautiful, but he didn't love me back. 

I didn’t have enough time to recover from the shock of it, or to feel the pain of rejection that I had feared and experienced all my life. Of course, he wouldn’t wait long enough for me to feel pain. His immediate instinct was to comfort. He told me he liked me, but we were only together 5 months. There was no way he could be in love. Liked me. Somehow I hated the word. Love and hate are feelings that anyone can understand. What does ""like"" mean? I like my girlfriend. I like pizza. I like Bloody Marys. 

He told me he was not freaked out by my confession, that he appreciated it, but love was still a far way off. I forced a smile and told him I felt like a fool for confessing, that I had misinterpreted his actions and words and thought that if he wasn't in love, he was at least crazy about me, or in some state of infatuation. He tried to explain to me that I shouldn’t regret telling him. He said he cared for me deeply, he wanted to spend time with me, he thought of me constantly, he wanted to please me. I shouldn’t be ashamed for confessing my feelings. Those words gave me an amazing sense of relief.

And while I breathed, the small moment of silence gave me something else. He was clutching me so close that all I could smell was his cologne. He was still here. He hadn't run away. My instincts were wrong, and yet they led me right where I needed to be anyway. I suddenly realized that I didn't need his love. I just needed him to know mine. Even if he didn't love me back, I had never felt more loved than I did with him. After years of looking for love, giving love and getting nothing back, I knew I didn't need him to put a name to what he felt. I just needed him to know my heart before it exploded, and now my heart is at rest. Everything I need is already there, only the words remain, and they can come at their own pace.

On New Year’s Eve one year ago, I made my New Year’s Resolution. After years of relationship failures and rejections, my only desire in the world at that time was to experience love, and to be loved. On the 31st of December 2010, I was halfway there, but getting to the second part of that wish is no longer my goal for next year. My new wish is to love him even more, and love this life we can share together, no matter what we call it.

Here's a picture of us on January 1st, a few minutes after midnight. Totally accidental shot and yet my favorite one to date: http://imgur.com/OoSf8.jpg

Thanks for reading. I know it was really cheesy but I am in that kind of mood and felt the need to share with the internets.

1270009651.0,8,self.love,bki27,When does the transition to a relationship begin?,lonelyguy15,9,1,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/bki27/when_does_the_transition_to_a_relationship_begin/,"I've never made it past a second date with a girl, except for the numerous times when we both realise there's nothing between us and we remain friends (whilst continuing to do stuff that could be misconstrued as dating, e.g. dinner, watching movies, etc).

Sometimes we seem to fall into the friend phase and I'll just suddenly realise that anything romantic with them would be weird, and I see them more like a sister than a potential lover.

Anyhow, I've met a girl I really like and we're probably going to go out. On one hand I would like to be in a romantic relationship, but on the other hand I feel that if I attempt to be in a romantic relationship I might ruin the chance for another great friend (many of my good friends are female.)

I could just jump in like I always do and let everything run its course, but my past experience has shown that if I do that she'll inevitably break off any contact with me or become a friend.

I mostly want to know at what point does the girl become a friend or a girlfriend and what determines this? Do I have to *make a move* to let her know I like her in that way? because I'm not good at moves.

When you've been single for as long as I have, having many female friends is starting to get frustrating.

*Edit: I went out with the girl, but we ended up inviting the friend through whom we met (all my fault in retrospect). I felt kind of ignored the whole time because the girl and friend have known each other for ages and had a lot to discuss.*

*She mentioned a couple of things that we could potentially do together that would exclude our mutual friend, although this could have been unintentional. Upon leaving she once again said we should catch up, but this time she mentioned another set of friends.*

*Is she telling me that we will only see each other in group situations? Should I attempt to pursue the activities that would cause us to be alone together, or do I have to be upfront about my intentions? I think she should be comfortable with just the two of us before I move forward. ARGH I HATE THIS.*

*Please, can anyone else offer their advice and/or perspective on this?*

I got inspired and thought: ""Why not post my story here ? Some people might be able to help !"". So without further ado, here's my long story (Sorry if my english is bad, its not my native tongue):

2 years ago, I met a girl, which I'll call A. I met her in school, the teacher made us sit next to each other, so basically we became friends right on the spot. She's pretty cute, gorgeous, smart and is super kind. At that time, I thought of her only as a friend, plus, she was in a relationship with my best friend. I supported their relationship because, well, the guy was my best friend, lets call him R. So R and A were a couple since the start of that school year, but they almost never interact with each other. A became really sad because of that and, as her seatmate, we kept on talking about it. We texted for really long times everyday and I had fun because she gives out a nice positive aura despite being neglected by R. So days passed, and, obviously, they broke up. R and I havent actually been interacting much that time too, since we were always busy and we were seated far from each other. A was deeply hurt because of that, and I comforted her everyday, through words and text. And so many weeks passed, I slowly developed feelings for her. At that time, she was always asking me who my crush was, and so I tell her that it was her. I told her that many times and I thought: ""Hey, she didn't change the way she treats me, maybe this means I have a chance !"". And so we continued our daily habits of texting, talking and sharing our thoughts. I was so goddamn happy then, but after that, things went downhill. She got a new boyfriend, lets call him L. She said that she fell for L because she said that L was the only one who comforted her during her breakup with R. Now imagine how I felt about this. I comforted her, I sacrificed alot, and I mean ALOT of time for her. A and L were also really lovey-dovey in public, I saw them hugging, kissing, etc. Once, I even watched them as another couple challenged them to a ""Longest kisser"" challenge. I also heard alot of dirty things about her, but it didnt change my feelings for her. Since then I experienced depression, I would lock myself every night in my room and cry, and sometimes, I even inflict pain to myself by slashing my wrists with a cutter, banging my head on the wall and leaning my back against sharp objects. Once, I even stabbed my hand with a pencil (I still have the lead stuck in my hand, and it can be seen clearly). So months went on like that, until A and L broke up. I was kinda sad, since A looked so happy with L, but at the same time, I was really happy, and I felt guilty about that. But I still saw L kiss A once after I heard of their breakup, so my heart was broken again. But after that, our daily routine came back, and I was really happy. I gave her a pair of earrings and a necklace during Christmas that year, and she gave me a stuffed toy (which I sleep with beside me, to this day). Then life went on, our daily routine continued until last year. Take note that she still loves R, my best friend, since she broke up with L up to this day. Last year I wondered why our daily routine suddenly stopped, then I found out that R and A were at the pre-relationship stage (I was invited to watch a horror movie, but I was watching them the entire time there). I was heartbroken AGAIN. My depression state came back. I was really really shocked at that point. R knew I liked A, and he even told me that he doesnt like A anymore. So more days go on, and suddenly their relationship stopped. I was told that R didn't want to ask A's parents for permission to court her, so he stopped. A was hurt again, but she continued to love him. I was really angry at R. Im really skinny and weak, while R was really buff, but even so, I still wanted to punch him so hard. It was a good thing that I calmed down before having seen him again. So lots of things happened, she was really close with other guys, but with me, I think she doesn't want to interact with me since then up to now. Even through text, she sends me 2 word messages every 10 minutes, so I start to think: ""I'm a piece of trash that doesn't deserve anything"". But even so, I really love her. During her birthday last year, I asked help from another classmate to help me bake a handmade cake for her. I successfully did it and I was really happy that she noticed my effort back then. I made a list of the days which made me especially happy such as: March 16, my bday, she hugged me last year, Valentines Day, I gave her a blue rose and chocolates, I got 2 hugs from her. So Im basically obsessed lol. We are still classmates up until now, and this is our last year. As Im typing this, Imtearing up, imagining the days before when I was so happy. I want to make her happy this year. What should I do ? (Thanks for reading if you did :') )",,False,,t5_2qhnh,False,,,True,t3_1ka3xp,http://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/1ka3xp/my_story/,

so she takes her pill's the doctor gave her, and we thought it would all be better,.

We have have found out that there is a problem with her hear beat, her recharge rate is very low, There's an appointment on tuesday to the doctor who apparently knows more about what's wrong,

She has to leave me for a few day's to her mother's to ensure she dosent digest any nicotine or caffine or any Stimulant, because it could cause my queen to suffer a Heart Attack,

So while she's away, I thought  of something in my head
it kinda flowed of the tounge,

so Ill start by posting my picture that she didn't know I took

My Queen need's hope and if you can break a bottle for her hopefully we will have alot of comments with I ""broke a bottle for you Becca"" with pictures, She dosent know Im doing this, it would be wonder full to see her eyes shine bright when she gets to see it

My mind is a torrent of questions and possibilities that I can't even get any sort of a hold on, but I'll try my best to describe it for you...

When I was six my parents got divorced (I'm nineteen now). I'm sure a great amount of us have a similar story. After that my mother married a man who she currently does not love and does not remember why she ever married, but is still married to. I'm well aware of the fact that their love faded very soon after marriage, but she stayed with him so that me and my brother could be taken care of (which I wish she didn't do out of love for her but am mind-blowingly grateful for her doing anyways).

I grew up generally as an outcast in school. I did damn near no dating the entire time, lost my virginity at seventeen to a girl who then didn't want anything to do with me shortly after, and overall showed up to college very uninformed on matters of the heart. During this time the most popular musical artists, the faces we saw on MTV, the saturization of advertising, the sexual nature of most popular films, and basically every popular media source was telling me that the only thing I should want in the whole world was either love or sex, but most importantly sex (I know this is a bit of a generalization, but for the most part it's accurate in my opinion).

I saw through the sexual pressure and saw that, though everyone else just wanted to fuck, the thing that would really make me happy was love. It wasn't long into my freshman year of college that I realized that no one can love anyone else without loving their self, and after some great trial and thought, I learned to do so, and now love myself immensely (which is something I could definitely not have said two years ago). Then came what I was looking for...

I finally got into a relationship with this girl. Looking back, I now realize that she never really wanted a relationship. I probably could have seen this from the beginning, but I wasn't sharp enough with love to see it. Over the two months that we spent nights together and then the four months that we were officially dating, I fell deeply into my first love. Unfortunately, she didn't. Best way to put it is that every time I said ""I love you"", she said it back and didn't really mean it, but my mind blocked out the obviously false way she acted because I wanted love so bad. Don't get me wrong, I know she loved me, but she was never in love with me, and she only went along with it so she wouldn't hurt me.

Just for you ladies out there, in my personal opinion, if he says he loves you, and you don't love him back, just say you're just not to that point yet, but you'd like to move toward it. Rip it off like a band-aid, because ripping stitches out later fucking sucks.

Anyways, she dumped me about three weeks before this school year started. I thought I'd gotten over it until I saw her walk into a dorm building with a kid I know, drunk. I do not know what they did, and it's absolutely none of my business, but after I saw that I cracked, hid under a generator by my school's music building and cried for two hours. Getting attached can really suck sometimes.

Now here I am, in an American college, trying to find love. Ha. I talk with my friends, boys and girls, and their always saying ""should I hook up with her?"" ""You think I could hook up with him?"" ""Did you hear so and so and whats her face hooked up?"". Unfortunately, all I can think of is...IS THAT ALL THIS FUCKING IS TO YOU???? Hooking up? Why don't you ask ""Could I get into a relationship with him?"" Why don't you ask ""Could I cuddle with her tonight?"" Why don't these fucking children put any meaning to their relations? Is it because fifty percent of our parents said ""Fuck this, I'm out"" without even thinking for a moment how it will effect us? Is it because all of our media tells us to get it in all the time and not think about love, cause bitches is just hoes and tricks? Is anyone looking for love? Is our entire generation just fated to think that sex is the main course, and love is a side effect? Is Lil Wayne really the new Barry White to these kids?

Is love dead? Give me your opinion.

**TL;DR**: Because of our culture, the values that were taught or not taught to our youth in important years, or whatever it might be, is love a hopeless pursuit for those with the strength to look for it to the ends of the earth?",,False,,t5_2qhnh,False,,,True,t3_11i2ui,http://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/11i2ui/is_love_dead/,

Hope

Too many times have said that I have seen what I want to be in a dream. But what does that really mean?
I may just be blowing off steam, but I have seen myself in the arms of the girl I wish to be with floating through the air as if weightless. But that's the difference, because in the real world, I give to the deference of others simply because that is what our mothers taught us. Back to the dream, I see myself holding your hand laughing and crying with you, running through city streets without a care because you know I'm there to protect you and you say you don't need me too. But the taxi fares of the hustle and bustle of the dream street seems to be based on the fact that no one truly cares
In my dream, when you read my art, tears flow from your face and you give me a hug and say as if a damsel in distress ""You came!""
But really, I just wait for you to hate me, and see your blank face as if a damsel in disdain saying ""what a mess you've made""

1342338555.0,7,self.love,wl471,I think I'm falling for my friend... again. But this time it feels more serious.,FuckImOnReddit,8,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/wl471/i_think_im_falling_for_my_friend_again_but_this/,"**Context:** So last year, I started to like one of my good friends. After crushing on him for a couple of months, I decided to spill the beans and just tell him that I liked him. Now, this guy and I are such good friends that we've talked about stuff like love and relationships before. I was a little worried what would happen if I told him, so I kept it to myself. But after watching a movie that really got to me, I knew I had to tell him. His reaction wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. He just said he wasn't ready for a relationship just yet and that we should just continue to be friends. Being way too used to rejection, I was totally okay with this. And we continued to be friends. In fact, I think that incidence made our friendship even stronger. We are even closer now than we were prior to my admission of my feelings for him.

**A Few Months Go By:** Eventually, I got over my feelings for this friend. We're so chill about the whole thing that I could bring up ""Back when I liked you"" and there would be no sense of awkward or weirdness. We were just chill. Starting March of this year, I had begun to have a crush on another friend and this lasted until late April/early May. During April, one of my oldest friends from high school decided to end our friendship solely because of a misunderstanding. This made me so upset. I was angry, I was sad, I was so overwhelmed with emotion. And my friend, the one who I had crushed on months before, knew *exactly* what to say to make me feel better. He didn't directly console me by saying things like ""Well, at least..."" or something like ""She was a bitch, anyways."" He just made me laugh which is always one of the best ways to get me to feel better after feeling like shit. And it just struck me how well he knew how to respond to my being upset. The day after, he spent the whole day with me as we worked on our homework. And it was just nice. When I thought about it, I was like ""That was so nice of him to do all this... Why can't I have a guy like that?"". I started to worry as I continued on this line of thought, though: Was I starting to like him again? After talking about it with a friend, I had come to the conclusion that I just really appreciated my friendship with him.

**In More Recent Months (May through July):** I started dating a slightly older guy a little over a month ago. He's great. We have similar tastes in humor, he's a smart guy, is very nice, and is generally a good guy. As nice as it is to spend time with him and stuff, I'm still not entirely comfortable with him. I have massive trust issues, so it takes a while for me to open up to people unless I really feel like they're trustworthy. I noticed upon getting to know this older guy, though, that there are some odd similarities between him and the friend that I had crushed on during fall 2011. I jokingly wondered aloud to a few people (including this same friend) if there is a pattern going on with the kinds of guys I liked.

**Here's The Problem:** Recently, I've been thinking about this friend again... a lot. And today, I just had to come to him to tell him something deep that was disturbing me. And like a good friend, he listened and gave me advice (even if he was a bit drunk and had to make a conscious effort to type with proper spelling and grammar). I think every so often what it would be like if me and him got together anytime soon, and I don't know. I just feel like I'd be happy because we're such good friends. 

Unfortunately, I have three problems: 

1. He doesn't like the idea of dating a friend because it might put the friendship at stake if the romantic relationship is finished. 

2. As much as I like the guy as a friend, he's irresponsible as fuck. He's going to take a year off from school to work, but he hasn't even found work for the year yet. I think I'd have trouble dating someone who didn't have some kind of job.

3. I'm going to be moving away for school. About three states away.

This sucks.

So I like this girl, but there's a problem which i'll get to later. Her and I have hung out a few times, talked innocently about this and that, and I have even attempted (successfully i don't know) to flirt with her. And from what I can gather, she hasn't rejected any of it. She also gets close to me every chance she gets and I can't for the life of me get her out of my head. She's the cutest thing I have ever seen, is very athletic and likes sports (like me), smart, very funny, and her and I have a surprising number of things in common. She acts way older than her age and looks it to. If I were to make a list of what I looked for in a girl, she would fulfill almost 100% of it. 

But now to the problem(s) which pains me to type. 1. She's a couple years younger than me (ill give you that I am a junior in high school). 2. Is moving away (when I think she is) near the beginning of school next year. And finally 3. She's my sister's friend (biggest one).

I wish I could tell her that I have feelings for her but I just can't bring myself to do it. My own sensibility is getting in the way. I obviously have realized all these issues and have thought about them for while and concluded that I can't, in any way, tell her I like her. But I would do almost anything to just spend this summer with her. I just don't know if I'm gonna find a girl like her anymore that seems to like me back. 

*My sister knows that I like her btw, and she seems to be ok with it. And this shouldn't come off creepy because it honestly isn't, I've simply fallen for this girl. 

What I'm saying [r/love](http://www.reddit.com/r/love/), is that like much of you, I'm confused and would like some feedback if any. You don't have to say the thing I want to hear but just be honest.

Ever since then we have texted each other all the time unless one of is sleeping, at school or working. We do typical things like tease each other and call each other cute/handsome/beautiful etc. Additionally, we talk about doing things together like having a bonfire and such.

I'm not socially inept or anything and I am good at reading people but the fact that I can't see her body language is throwing me off essentially. I also have the resources to go and see her if I wanted to pursue it.

I'm in my early 20's, male, and recently got out of a 5 year relationship with someone (Although the relationship was dead in the water for the last 6-12 months). Several years ago my mother died, and for a number of years, up to very recently, I went through a pretty bad depression. I didn't actually know I was depressed at the time, but I refused to talk to people or leave the house, I just became incredibly introverted, and that sort of killed the relationship with my ex. For some reason though, I was incredibly happy when it ended, I just felt like a weight was lifted off my chest, and I could breath again, it's hard enough to make another person happy, when you can't even make yourself happy, so I suddenly embarked on a journey to make myself happy, get back in shape, and just turn my life around before I get stuck in a rut. 

First day out of my relationship, I swore off women completely for as long as it took to get myself to a place where I'm completely happy. I was the number one priority. After a workmate heard of my breakup, he suggested I put my profile on an online dating site. I was completely apprehensive, but due to constant bugging, I just did it to keep him happy, and put a barebones profile up, with no intention of ever using it. About a week after creating a profile, out of curiosity I logged on and had a few messages, a few visits, but nothing promising. One of the matches that was suggested to me though, was this girl. Instantly I thought she was beautiful, and I messaged her. Within a few minutes she messaged back, and we hit it off straight away. We share many of the same interests, and I think there was an instant attraction on both sides.

We started to Skype from pretty much day one, and have done almost every night until the early hours of the morning. We pretty much know everything about each other, even the darkest corners of our past. About two weeks ago, we decided to become exclusive until we meet, but then later decided that was pretty much ""going out"" so we decided to make it official, which is something I'd never normally consider, but this for this girl, I was willing to make the leap. I have pretty big issues with commitment since my breakup, but the thought of being with the girl just overpowers those fears.

Since the day I've met her, she's fixed me, I'm no longer depressed, in all honesty, I've never been happier. I think I'm falling in love with this girl, which honestly scares me, because we haven't even met, or kissed or touched. I feel like I'm clinically insane for feeling this way, so I guess I'm just writing this to get some input from you guys.

Thanks.

P.S I'm 22, she's 18, she's mature for her age, and the reasoning we haven't met is because she has school commitments until Easter, and she's ~100 miles away. I'll be going up there for 4 days at the end of the month, which will be our first meeting.

TL;DR - Met a girl online, she took me out of depression, think I'm falling in love.

Junior year of highschool, I met this freshman girl. From the moment I looked into her eyes, I knew I was in love. Yes, I know I was young and that sounds silly, I know that's what you're thinking right now but just hear me out. For the next few weeks, we started talking, and became VERY good and close friends. I then asked her out, and she said she needs time to think. The next week she starts dating a big burly rugby player. This guy... this guy is insane. Not figuratively, but literally. Over the course of the summer, he attempts suicide a few times because he wants to ""push the limits of his body"", decides to join the army, and other crazy stuff I don't remember. She broke up with him in the hospital after he OD'd on energy drinks, and he later went on to threaten to kill her and her best friend. Really messed up guy. During this whole time, I continue to be her best friend, like a brother to her. After she breaks up with him, I ask her out again, for Homecoming. She turns me down in favour of another guy, one that we both *sorta* knew. Throughout their relationship, I continued to be her big brother, being there for her when she needed me. He broke up with her at the end of her sophomore year (my senior year) mostly because she wouldn't suck his dick. I then asked her out again, this time for Prom. We went to prom, and a week later she kissed me and said that yes, she will go out with me. Next weekend, she decides that it was a mistake, that she should never have said yes. So I say, ok, let's see how this goes. During the summer before I went to college (my college is , we became even closer than before, until one day, it happened. I was alone with her, and we started making out. This weirdness continues for a few weeks, but I find out that I wasn't the only guy in her life. I decide to skip past it and I ask her to cut off her relationship with him, and she does. From what she told me, it was around that time that she starts realizing what an amazing guy I am, how loyal, honest, loving, etc, and she professes her love for me as well. I'm now the happiest I've ever been.

The next two years are amazing. Truly and honestly amazing. We get to know each other SO well, we are the envy of all our friends, we are truly in love. A mature love at that. We gave each other space when needed, and we remained best friends and lovers. I don't doubt a single word she tells me, I even give her a ring and she accepts it while crying with joy. I love her with every fiber of my being, and I honestly believe she loves me too. I even go through go through bouts of depression and she's always there, always at my side, always supportive, always loving. She was my rock. My relationship with my family was not even close to good, and she and her family filled that void for me. Up to 2 weeks ago, everything was amazing. 

Then she went to college. I barely hear from her during the first weekend. She left on a Thursday and Sunday night was the first time we talked. I had to call her multiple times because I was scared, she kept saying ""i can't do this now"" ""my roommate is asleep"" ""please not now"", but I insist. She finally picks up, and we talk. We decide to try harder at this, to talk more, for me to visit more (she's only 40 minutes away), to just… be better. The next morning while I'm at work, after talking (texting) about classes and things, I say ""I love you"". She responds with my name, followed by ""…"". At this point I know something is really wrong. I take off from work call her. She says she wants to break up because things are not the same, she doesn't love me anymore. I can't let go, so I tell her that I'm coming to talk. We talk, and in tears, I ask if she cheated on me. She says yes. After we had talked the night before about being a better couple, she went and had sex with a guy she met 2 days before. Since I love her enormously, I decide to forgive and forget, if only she would work with me on this. She agrees, and we try again, we start fresh. The next weekend, I visit again, and this time it's AMAZING. We're SO good. Just like when we started, back in our glory days. We make love many many times (not fuck, but… love) and take midnight walks. We watch fireworks while hugging in the park. It's just… amazing.

Two days ago, Sunday, we were supposed to meet for dinner because she was home for Labour Day. She tells me this cannot go on. I'm confused at this point, because we had been doing so well. She says, again, things are not the same anymore. She doesn't miss me, she doesn't love me, she doesn't want to put an effort. Among others, I tell her ""we're so comfortable with each other, we know each other so well"" and I ask her if she knows him like she knows me. She says ""I'd like to"". She ended up leaving the ring on my table and leaving me there. 

Everything I was, everything I did, I did with her and for her. All my hobbies I shared with her. I was defined by her. We had a past, we had an amazing present, and we made SO many plans for the future. We named our kids, we told each other stories of our future life together. I was so good to her. I'm not being arrogant or anything, but everyone told her how lucky she is to have me. I'm romantic, loving, loyal, honest, just because I care about her. 

By now, she probably spent the night with that cocksucker, and I can't bear the thought of them together so soon after she made a lifetime commitment. Reddit, what am I to do? Everything reminds me of her. I spend a lot of time on the computer (I love eSports and I'm a comp sci major) and everything around me is connected to her. I can't escape her. Any advice? Do I talk to her and tell her to come back, tell her she made a mistake? Do I go over to her and throw money and her face, saying ""I've paid my whore""?
What do I do?

TL;DR I lost a long-time, mature relationship because she cheated and I can't get over it. Help?

EDIT: As of last weekend, she's officially in a relationship with the other guy. I'm absolutely certain that she's been lying to me all along, all these years.

I've told her I like her, but she seem to believe me. She's never had a relationship and is very self conscious, so whenever I call her beautiful or just compliment her in general, I'm pretty sure she thinks I'm lying to be nice. I'm trying not to just confess absolute love because love intimidates her, but I don't know what else to do to try and convince her of my feelings.

inb4 she's not that into you: Some of her closest friends have come to me and asked me if her and I had a thing. One explained to me how she only ever acted the way she acts around me around a guy she fell for a few years back (he didn't feel the same way, pretty sure it helped scare her out of love), and told me that she acts possessive of me. The girl I like even compared me to the guy once in conversation, though I'm not sure how to feel about that.

We talk at night till I pass out from exhaustion, when she's around I can't look at anyone else, and I want nothing more than to kiss her square on the lips. I hate thinking she'll be forever alone because I want to be there for her. I want to show her love can be amazing. She makes me ache in the best way. I just don't know what to do....

Installing Love 

Customer Service: Can you install Love? 

Customer: I can do that. I'm not very technical, but I think I'm ready to install now. What do I do first? 

Service: The first step is to open your Heart. Have you located your Heart? 

Customer: Yes, I have, but there are several programs running right now. Is it okay to install while they are running? 

Service: What programs are running? 

Customer: Let me see... I have Pasthurt.exe, Lowesteem.exe, Grudge.exe and Resentment.com running right now. 

Service: No problem. Love will automatically erase Pasthurt.exe from your current operating system. It may remain in your permanent memory, but it will no longer disrupt other programs. Love will eventually overwrite Lowesteem.exe whit a module of its own, called Highesteem.exe. However, you have to completely turn off Grudge.exe and Resentment.com. Those programs prevent Love from being properly installed. 
Can you turn those off? 

Customer: I don't know how to turn them off. Can you tell me how? 

Service: My pleasure. Go to your Start menu and invoke Forgiveness.exe. Do this as many times as necessary until Grudge.exe and Resentment.com have been completely erased. 

Customer: Okay, I'm done. Love has started installing itself automatically. Is that normal? 

Service: Yes it is. You should receive a message that says it will reinstall for the life of your Heart. Do you see that message? 

Customer: Yes I do. Is it completely installed? 

Service: Yes, but remember that you have only the base program. You need to begin connecting to other Hearts to get the upgrades. 

Customer: Oops! I have an error message already. What should I do? 

Service: What does the message say? 

Customer: It says ""Error 412"" Program not run on internal components. 
What does that mean? 

Service: Don't worry, that's a common problem. It means that the Love program is set up to run on external Hearts but has not yet been running on your Heart. It is one of those complicated programming things, but in non-technical terms it means that you have to ""love"" your own machine before it can ""love"" others. 

Customer: So what should I do? 

Service: Can you find the directory called ""Self-acceptance""? 

Customer: Yes, I have it. 

Service: Excellent, you are getting good at this. 

Customer: Thank you. 

Service: You're welcome. Click on the following files and then copy them to the ""Myheart"" directory: Forgiveself.doc, Selfesteem.txt, Realizeworth.txt and Goodness.doc. The system will overwrite conflicting files and begin patching any faulty programming. Also, you need to delete ""Selfcriticize.exe"" from all directories, and then empty your recycle bin afterwards to make sure it is completely gone and never comes back. 

Customer: Got it! Wow! My Heart is filling up with really neat files. Smile.mpg is playing on my monitor right now, and it shows that Warmth.com, Peace.exe and Contentment.com are copying themselves all over my Heart! 

Service: Then Love is installed and running. You should be able to handle it from here. One more thing before I go.. 

Customer: Yes? 

Service: Love is freeware. Be sure to give it and its various modules to everybody you are meeting. They will in turn share it with other people, and they will return some really neat modules back to you. 

Customer: I will. Thank you for your help. 

Service: You're very welcome.

1298595443.0,8,self.love,fs7df,It isn't so much the heartbreak as I'm scared I lost my best friend.  ,this_isnt_my_main,8,0,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/fs7df/it_isnt_so_much_the_heartbreak_as_im_scared_i/,"A short back story.   There's a girl,  we've been great friends since the day we met 8 years ago.    We dated off and on for about 3 years.  While we had ""ups and downs""  we never once had any serious disagreements. We also were never in a committed relationship,  something she wanted,  something I realize today I was scared of because of how I felt about her.  

She got married,  I had a girlfriend,  we didn't talk for a long time.  She's now divorced,  I'm now single,  we've been hanging out a lot.   As if no time had past,  she is again my best friend,  I trust her as much as ever,  I feel the same warm rush every time I see her.  It is as if nothing has changed,  in fact it has only become stronger.  

This is odd for me.  I'm not an exceptionally ""romantic"" person.  I'm not used to feeling this way.   I've not felt this way since the first time we were around each other.  I'm now afraid my inability to keep how I felt unsaid,  may have damaged this.   I don't know,  I'm bad at the male/female translation.   

Up to this point we spent a few days out of the week together and almost every weekend, going out when her ex had her child,  or me at her house when she had her daughter.  I never in my life have expressed my feelings to someone like this,  but I felt I have to be completely honest with her.  Now I'm scared.

The following is a conversation between her and I on facebook.   I originally sent her a text message after a night out at a club with her.   I sent her a text message,  but felt it probably didn't do justice to what I was trying to express.  I realize even now that words really can't no matter how much time you spend trying to piece them together, translating from feeling to text.  

http://pastebin.com/LnSjpsw3

This is the first time I've ever written anything like this to anyone.  It didn't turn out so great for me,  but more than anything in this short time since we've stopped talking,  it feels horrific.   It is strange how missing just one person makes the world feel like such an empty place even though I'm surrounded by so many people.   I realize she has some damage from all the bullshit she's been through with other guys.   I know she's scared.   I also know she trusts me a lot and that I'm one of her best friends,  and she mine.   I'm just fearful I guess.


I guess I just need to vent,  need to talk.   Whatever.   In my 30 years I've never quite felt like this so I'm not sure how to react,  I just know it hurts and is scary as hell.  



[  I apologize for the pastebin,  I know it kind of runs together,   I'm Me on the facebook header,  and her ""Her""   obviously.   Just look for those if you get confused reading them.   I've redacted all names and identifying features from the paste as well ]

The main problem is that you've never really had a girlfriend, so you feel like you're completely incompetent and wouldn't know where to begin to find a girl in the first place.

Then you meet a girl and somehow it works. You just click. You really like each other. You date, you hold each other, you kiss.

Now you know this isn't necessarily going to be the one. Hell, you aren't going to marry the first girl you meet, but suddenly the world doesn't seem such a horrible place any more.

But then it comes out: she's had far more partners than you and she cheated on one of her boyfriends. You tell yourself that she was young and naive and now she's looking for something else. She tells you she's afraid of hurting you, but you don't care. If anything, you need to be hurt, you've missed out on the sting of love lost, and you've got a lot of catching up to do.

Then she tells you she's leaving the country next year.

Do you pursue the relationship even though you think it's destined to fail? You know eventually your fears of her past will catch up to your insecurities, and if not, she's probably not going to stay in the country for you.

You could avoid all the drama and move on, but what are the odds you're going to find another girl like this?

I faked it and said it was cool, and eventually got them together, though it killed me emotionally. I kept smiling and stayed happy for them. 
My friend's new boyfriend thought of me as a friend. He talked to me a lot about her, not knowing how much it hurt me. I'm pretty sure that if he knew, he would have stopped. We trusted each other with everything, and soon he told me I was his best friend. My ex-best friend, however, started complaining about him constantly and picked fights frequently. She was way too clingy. Whenever he couldn't make it to hang out, she would get angry and yell at him for it. 
They eventually got fed up with each other and broke up. I've never seen people so happy about breaking up. My ex-friend basically dumped me as a friend as well. I started talking to her less and him more. I found out that we had a lot in common. My other friends kept trying to pair us together, and he denied it every time, which crushed me. 
I finally decided to have a talk with him and tell him exactly how I felt. I knew I would be making a huge mistake, but I did it anyway. He responded by telling me that he'd always really liked me, and thought I was really sweet and pretty. He basically spilled his heart out to me. I was actually crying out of happiness, and he asked me out, which of course I said yes.

5 years back i met a girl on the net. We started dating... we spent 2 years together. I love that girl MADLY. Damn i still love her... I don't know for whatsoever reason she cheated on me. We had a big fight. She broke up with me for another guy which turned out to be a liar and fooled her. I did everything possible to get her back but failed. They say if you really love her, let her go. She will come back which She never did. But even after 3 years that we broke up. i still dream of her sometimes and when i wake up in the morning i'm happy cause i saw her in my dreams. I'm not a guy who likes sharing his personal life with people. Some will say try to talk with her again. She hates me and doesn't want to see my face or hear my voice was what she said when we broke up. Since our break-up i saw her only 2 times in 3 years but didnt talk to her. My heart pounces when I see her, but I pretend to be calm. What should i do? If i see someone resembling her then for sure i would start to miss her more than usual.

Let me do a little background so your up to speed..
I was the kid in highschool, who could get along with everyone, but was very stubborn and came close to getting my ass kicked once or twice, i was in the group below the ""Popular"" group after year 8 after leaving them because i couldn't tolerate the fake bullshit and the heavy demand for everyone to be so cool.. 
I never cared for highschool, and i dropped out in my first term of yr11 (Im aussie)
Soon after i broke up with my girlfriend at the time because she was moving 3 hours away and it just wasnt going to work.
My dad was an alcoholic, and unemployed for most of his life, not much of a rolemodel, after i broke up with that girl, i went downhill, i got into drinking heavily and roaming the streets just being a pure douchebag.. Dad and i fought alot, he was always lecturing me that i wasn't the son he wanted or ever expected, and finally we got into a physical fight due to me not backing down and telling him to fuck off instead, 
The second after that finished, i bolted to my room, packed as much as i could and left.
I Spend the next 3 weeks moving from friends house to friends house, until i wasnt left with any more options, and slept under a bridge for a week and a half, living off restaurant throw outs and garbage.
I met a guy who had a spare room, and moved in asap, with an agreement of paying 150 dollars a week in rent, 
Centrelink, which is australias unemployment service run by the government, were paying me 500 a fortnight so that i could keep my head above water, and find a job. 
The problem with where i live, is that the majority is unemployed, and barely any jobs ever go, 
One day, as my mate got home, he bought over a few friends, 1 guy and 2 girls whom i'd never met before, i immediately noticed one of the girls, and after a few weeks, i knew i'd be dating her.
Surely enough i finally introduced myself and started seeing her heaps, we finally decided to become exclusive. 
My lack of job, or stability with my family and my small living space (Which was literally one room) didnt matter to her, we were in love, like REAL love.
We never fought, and having a stable job and finishing yr 12 herself, she was over alot, and helped with buying food and keeping me alive.
I never paid rent because every cent i had went into keeping myself fed and clean, and then her.
I was fine with this, the family i lived with understood my position and tolerated it for nearly a year and a half..
We fought probably a total of 2 times in our relationship, like REALLY big blowouts, I had become incredibly close to her family, and seen her father as the dad i had always wanted. He worked as a plasterer on work sites, and took me along occasionally to help me with some cash, everything was amazing.

Around july 20th last year, my grandfather had a stroke, and a week later passed away after another 2 strokes, this was the first time i was going to see my family and more importantly my dad, who i'd last seen holding me down with his hand around my throat and beating the life out of me.
I flew down to melbourne from the goldcoast, and attended the funeral and proceeded to exile myself from the family, still hating him with every ounce of my body, i honestly wanted him dead. 
around a month or two after the funeral, i moved home after being kicked out because i hadn't paid rent for so long, which is fair enough, i hold no grudge to them for that.
It was awkward for a month but got better slowly, i could tolerate being in the same room as him, and we never fought. He'd been seeing a psychiatrist and psychologist ever since i left, and was on heavy medication for depression and rage. 
Around christmas last year, my best mate and i were hanging out more than ever, i'd gotten a job and was slightly more stable than what i used to be. Although i was drinking again, and a hell of a lot.
My girlfriend never liked how much time i spent with him, she was jealous, and i should have realised it much sooner, but i was getting too comfortable with the relationship, and wasnt trying anymore.
Christmas eve after a big fight with her, i went to my mates once again, into the night after smoking a few joints and getting blind drunk, his sister was talking to me alot, and kissed me. 
I didnt stop her..
I rang my girlfriend half an hour later after collecting my head and sobering up quite quickly, to tell her what had happened.. 
And that was the end of us.
I didnt overly care to be honest, i was over it and wanted my mates sister, and we proceeded to have fun for 3 days, to when she told me she didnt want to do it anymore, and that hurt.
knowing i had given up a nearly 2 year relationship for this girl who dropped me at the flick of a hat took its toll on me, i was doing harder drugs, and wasting away, i was losing weight quick (im usually around 80 kilos, i was down to 68)
4 months later, i got in touch with the girl i broke up with on christmas eve, and ever since we've gotten close again, and its been a complete role reversal, i cant stop talking to her, i cant stop wanting  her and we're now on the verge of talking to her parents and telling them we want to be together.
She's fallen inlove with me again and i consider myself the luckiest guy in the world, although my anxiety now gorges itself on the thought of the multiple guys she was sleeping with while we were apart (she had the reputation of being a very easy slut) And knowing that hurt me more than anything in the world.
I'm incredibly over protective of her now, and she doesnt like it too much, but i cant help it. Anxiety is a very fickle thing....
I'm trying to move past it and block them out of my head, and it is working, but i know shes not as invested in us as i am, and it worries the shit out of me.
She's forgiven me for kissing my mates sister and knows i could never do that to her in all of our lives again.
I really am in love with her reddit, and while we've had a shitfight of a journey, i truly want her to be the one i spend my life with. I want my children to have her eyes and her smile, and her skin. And i want to grow old with her. 
She is everything i've got, and she's given the motivation to try harder and focus on a life long career that'll enable us to have a stable life together.

And for month we didn't speak, so one day i went to the theater and connected to their public wifi and I saw that i received a text message from jade. It was time for the movie so it had to wait, during the movie all I could think about was her, i can't even remember what movie we saw due to the fact i paid no attention at all. So we got out and we went to starbucks and i connected to see her text, she said she wanted to talk to me, that she misses me and that all she can think about is me. So i got home later that day and I sent her a text message almost instantly she replies, baby is that you? diego i dont want to be apart from you, i need you to be in my life please. I couldn't say no I was deeply in love with her. And one night we're texting and she said i need to tell you something. Instantly my blood raced I almost passed out because i knew something bad was coming. I cheated on you with juan she said, at that moment i dropped my ipod and just left i didn't even know where i was going i walked so long when i came to i realized i was in a completely different part of the city. I took a cab home and when i got their my ipod was dead i charged it and when it turned on it told me i had 24 messages all from jade, she was worried and sad and i just didn't know how to grasp the situation so i said look, i understand and it's not cheating we cant be together we'er not even in the same country but it does hurt, i need time to get over this goodbye. And i never texted her for months until one day i thought i was over it and i texted her, and she instantly replied i just want you to know i'm sorry and i love you. I cried, I cried so much never in a million year i'd think that i could cry that much that i feel so hard that i let someone do that to me, ever since then i have problems trusting women and i keep hurting them because of that. Anyways thank you guys again for listening and reading it means a lot. I'm just doing these cause i wanted to let it out and there will be more if you're interested in reading these thanks!

I'd like to speak about some thoughts regarding love which bother me since a few days. So, I'm a guy and I came in contact with another guy two years ago. We're chatting everyday and share quite a few interests. We also met several times in Rl. 
What me bothers, I like him, it seems I like him so much, that my stupid brain thinks about kissing him or huddle against him. But it drives me crazy, because on the sexual base I'm not into guys. 
So I'm confused. Can you love somebody in this way, but also have no sexual interests behind this?!
Another fact behind this that some kind of scares me: If my brain comes up with this, it impersonate myself as a female version of myself. That's totally confusing to me.

And on the other hand, I dream about having a girlfriend and have also sexual interests in women. So I don't know... I'm totally upside down with my thoughts...",,False,,t5_2qhnh,False,,,True,t3_r3t5p,http://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/r3t5p/can_you_love_someone_without_sexual_interests/,

What are your thoughts on the reality/blinding aspect of young love?

I am 19 years old. I've been involved off and on with the same girl for 3 years (the breakups have been caused by distance, we go to college about 2500 miles apart) but over the last couple months it has become far more serious and I know we both think about a common future very often. I'm quite certain that I am madly in love with this girl and I just want to know how you knew your spouse was the one for you - and when you were positive that it was the right decision. I understand that love is not formulaic- there is no right and wrong, but I'm just looking for advice. I'm very opposed to divorce and while I'm not contemplating getting married any time soon I want to be sure that I am investing my time in the right person (I have unwavering confidence that I am, but I would love to hear other points of view)

Also appreciated: advice for distance relationships, cute anecdotes, any advice at all really (I'm just a kid!)

After several delays, I have managed to start to write this description of a revelation that I just had. I am sitting in my room, listening to Zoé and watching Johhny Bravo. 

I am also very high. On marijuana. 

About 6 hours ago, I went and visited a friend who is taking care of another friend at a Honduran Military Hospital. I got there, we smoked a blunt, went inside, watched part of “The Hurt Locker”, ate junk food out a vending machine, smoked another blunt, I departed. 

On the long ass ride back, I started thinking about my currently ex-girlfriend. She’s a really sweet girl, who has a son. But, who in my opinion got a bad hand in life (teen pregnancy, abusive ex-boyfriends, etc.). 

Anyway, even though my instinct told me that she was nothing but trouble, I went out with her. We dated for about 5 months, 3 of them kind of tense and long-distance and then she broke my heart and kicked my ass out of her life.

It broke my heart. I had lost my job. I had lost my girl. I was fucked. 

I stared smoking pot. I got better. 

She came back. There was an…incident. 3 weeks later, she said we were friends. I thought about her comment and told her that I couldn’t handle the friend status. And I broke it off. And broke her heart. 

We drifted apart. She owes me money, but is responsible enough to pay me back. 

I think things over. I miss her. I started calling her and talking to her. 

One night, drunk and high, I looked at her Facebook. I saw a picture of her and another dude. I started to freak out. I couldn’t handle the fact that she had REPLACED me. I called her at 3 am. 

I totally lost it. I cried. And cried. And barely made out fragmented, blathering sentences. 

She wouldn’t listen. She wouldn’t REASON. She wouldn’t admit to having a relationship with the other guy. 

She told me. “We’ll talk tomorrow.” She hanged up. 

Things we’re very, very bad afterwards. Bear in mind that all of this was not less than 72 hours ago.  

She said that she needed space. 

I got angry. I got sad. I had chest pains. My heart was shattering. Again. 

What had I done to deserve such heinous treatment? I DESERVED an explanation. A RATIONAL one. 

I spoke man to man to my father for the first time in my life. I was SHOCKED to hear what he had to say. 

I hated all women. Equally. DEVIL WOMAN. 

I accepted the fact that I was probably never gonna see my X again. 

And my heart shattered.

But I was OK. 

The language behind the emails and text messages were violent. And painful. 

And blameful. 

I bowed my head and felt guilty. 

And I was almost sure that I had lost her. 

And it hurt. But, I didn’t know why. 

UNTIL TONIGHT. 

On the way back from the hospital (you remember the hospital, right?); I started to think about everything about her. And us. 

I couldn’t figure out why it hurt so much. Why her?

I looked up at the sky and asked (begged) God for an answer. I believe in God (non-practicing Evangelist, pastor’s son). 

And He gave it to me. 

THE SPARK. 

I’m in love. 

But, I forgot The Spark. 

We went out once and I place my hand on her, nonchalantly and she wrapped her pinky around mine. 
I was electrocuted. I felt a shock run from the pit of my stomach to the tip of my spinal cord. I nearly crashed into a telephone pole. 

She was none the wiser. 

I felt it again tonight. Nearly crashed into a telephone pole again. 

I started to cry. I started to laugh, because I imagined myself telling my friends tomorrow. 

First time I’ve every felt this.

It could be better, but for the most part we're extremely compatible and great for each other both in short and long term.

We have a lot going for us, but the few things stacked against us, are stacked hard;

We live in the same country, but ~1800 miles apart.
We both get a lot of attention from the opposite gender

And... that's about it, now, I'm ironwilled and lionhearted. He's expressed some wavering tonight and today on whether or not he wants to stay serious as he's suffering from conflicting feelings. On one end, he claims he loves me and wants to stay together but on the other he respects his family's opinion that he's too young to be this serious about a relationship. He's also been going to a couple of parties lately, and while I don't suspect him of cheating, I do think his coming in contact with other women there has something to do with it.

Part of me says ""If he can't be confident in the relationship and you can, then he's no good, he's just going to run off on you."" but the other part (much stronger) says ""Keep him. He's the best thing ever, are you stupid?""

I want him to be happy, and I've heavily considered just sayign ""Go, do what you need to do, be happy, and leave me out of your life."" --- I never date the same person twice and I've made exceptions to that rule that ended terribly, I won't do that again. Meaning, if we split, we split forever, no two ways about it. I won't wait for anyone, and I won't take anyone back.

I firmly believe it's possible for him to come through this and be okay with our relationship again but he's chock full of... cognitive dissonance. It's extremely disappointing. He wants to stay but worries he's missing out on physical interaction. I won't stand around knowing he's unhappy and feels even more stressed out with our relationship like it is. I'm trying to figure out how to close the distance, I've got things pretty figured but he has no idea where he's going for grad school at the end of the year.

What do I do? Should I just let him go? Or do you think we can hang in there?
 

This is us, being happy and awesome, like we should be..

I'm an 18-y/o guy and relatively recently I developed some pretty strong feelings for this girl. She's been my best friend for a long time, so this made me pretty nervous. Well, I opened up and told her how I felt, and after she thought about it for a while, she told me that she didn't love me as anything more than a friend.
My problem right now is this: she still wants us to be best friends, but I don't know if I can do it. At this point, my feelings for her are all mixed up, and I don't know if it's possible for me to continue to be friends with her. Even thinking about her, let alone talking to or seeing her, is painful for me. All I can think about is loving her. I still want to be her best friend more than anything, she's such a great person, but I don't know if I have it in me.
So basically, I know that if I tell her I can't do it anymore, I''ll be hurting her as well as myself. I hate the thought of hurting her, but I also can't stand the thought of hurting myself more every day by suppressing my feelings. I started to think that maybe it's selfish of me to end our friendship...I just don't know.

There is a girl I have liked for about a year now. the only problem is that when i fell in love with her she was dating this other guy (someone who i have always hated, even b4 they dated). 
Around 6 months ago they broke up and i knew this was my chance to be with her. The only problem was that she was not emotionally stable after the breakup, so i decided to give her space and did not make any real move on her. Somehow, though, her ex found out i liked her. I guess he just noticed i treated her differently from any other girls. 
At a friends party he confronted me about it and we just had a loud argument and in the argument i the guy told me he still liked her and it was obvious he regretted breaking up with her. That night, after our argument, he called her up and told her I was in love with her.

The next day I tried to call the girl, but she was rejecting my calls. after a couple days she agreed to meet with me so we could talk about it. At our talk she told me what I had expected: that she was not in a good state now to have a relationship, but she did say that in the future there could be something between us. 

about two months passed without seeing much of each other. Every once in a while we would get together for tea and talk for a bit, but this was not very often. A saturday two weeks ago I was at the library writting a paper that was due on monday and she found me on google chat and told me to go over to her place for tea. I was about to go home anyways so I decided to go over to her place. 

After talking for a bit we decided to go up to her roof and admire the moon. We kept talking for some time and around midnight I told her we should go down to the beach where there is less light polution and we could see the moon and stars better. 

We were so into our conversation that we lost track of time and missed the last bus to her place. At this point I told her she should come sleep over to my place (my bus was still running) so she would not have to walk in the cold back to her place. I made this offer as a friend and nothing else. I had no intention of making a move on her because the last thing I wanted was a one night stand that would ruing our friendship. 

Once at my place we had a quick snack and she immediately afterwards went to my bed. At this point i had already started seeing some signs that her intentions were different from mine, but I was still treating it as if she was just a friend over at my place. Once in bed, she slowly got closer and closer to me until it was hard to ignore and we kissed for a bit. 

I was extremely confused so I had to stop this and tell her we needed to talk. I told her I needed to know her intentions, what she wanted. I did not want a one nightter and I wanted to make sure she wasnt just horny that night. She told me she does like me, but still could not be a serious relationship so we just cuddled the rest of the night. 

I did not get to sleep much because I kept thinking about the situation. I realized that the next month or two are the last time we will see each other for at least a year because I will be going on exchange next term and she will be going on her exchange the term after. This made me realize that it didnt matter if it was something casual, I just wanted to be with her for the time we had. I told her this in the morning and she agreed with me. She said she could not make any promises, but would still like to take our friendship to another level. 

Before I finish the last part of the story i have to admit that was one of the best nights of my life. sipping tea with her, sitting under the moonlight, going to the beach and having her in bed with me. It was a night that was special to me not because of what we did, but because it was with her. Everything we said and did felt so real and genuine. The next morning my reason was blurred with the experience of the night before. It gave me too much hope for the days and weeks to come. 

I feel that is why after 1 day, two days, four days....one week of not seeing her hurt so much. She kept telling me she was too busy, that she had too much work in school. at first i understood that because I was extremely busy myself and i knew from the beggining she would not be as willing as I was to sacrifice school work to be together. But after so many days of not seeing her, after so many days of her not making the effort to see me I realized that night did not mean the same to her as it did to me. After so many days I realized she just needed someone to make her feel good about heself and she knew I would not turn her down. The morning that we agreed to make our friendship something more, I did not realize the true meaning of ""I cant make any promises"". I had to learn what it means the hard way. 

It has been over two weeks now and I have calmed down. I am no longer pissed and depressed. I stopped calling and texting her because i refure to beg. Although my feelings for her are still there i have decided to move on. I dont think i will get a word from her any time soon.

Yesterday, I did the most difficult task of my short life so far. I called off a ""friendship"" with the first girl I ever loved. And I know it was love. You see, the feeling wasn't mutual, at least on the level I was searching for. And I knew this since the day we became close but instead I chose to try and make the ""best friend"" thing work. After spending the senior year of high school with her, I was terribly in love with her. We were close.

We grew so close over the summer and she even had a boyfriend at the time who she was also growing close with. But there was a catch her mom was abusive and she didn't let the girl I loved see her boyfriend expect for once that year and with that I was able to become extremely close to her . Now the end of summer comes around and I know fully well that I can't keep this up. I have to call of my ""friendship"" with her but The Abusive Mom got in the way.

You see, Abusive Mom intercepted a message about my drug use(weed) and then forbade that girl from talking to me. And this lead to 6 months of me not hearing a peep from her. And so what did I do? I used this opportunity to try and forget her. It didn't work obviously and in fact just made me want to talk to her more. Then comes the start of the new year and it's an incredibly choatic mess. 

Skip past a lot of events, I was able to talk to her semi regularly and every time I did, I had to fight the urge to tell I loved her but I couldn't stay friends.  But yesterday, Mother's Day, the day where this love of mine disowned her mom, I told her I simply couldn't be friends anymore and I needed to kill this friendship. It was an emotional conversation most of the emotion coming from me but I did the deed. And I felt so good afterward.

To those with that ""Best Friend"" please do yourself a favor and tell them. Tell the one your in love with that you love them but be ready to kill the relationship. Don't be afaird to end it because ultimately it's for the best. You will feel so much better, trust me. I was an emotional wreak for over a year because I kept this obvious secret to myself. 

I know this is very disjointed and I will gladly answer any question anyone reading this might have. 

TL;DR: For those with that ""best friend"" if you know it can't work and will never happen, please don't cling to some bizzare hope it could. Discuss your feelings with that person.

Four years ago right around the time I graduated high school, this girl added me on Facebook.  Not something I would have normally accepted, but she was going to the same college and expressed some similar interests so I figured sure.  I wanted to meet some new people right?  We talked a couple times later in the summer and she seemed pretty cool, but at the time judging from her pictures she just wasn't my type.

Then school started.  We went to class together, we ate together, we were together a lot.  I couldn't have been more wrong about her not being my type.  Attraction was almost instant on my part.  The only problem was she had a boyfriend.  And as the semester went on, it became increasingly difficult for me.  I was hurting all the time.  At the end of that semester I decided I would stop talking to her.  For the most part that rang true.  We only saw each other a couple times the following semester, because she asked and I couldn't say no.  By sophomore year we had stopped talking entirely and I was, as far as I knew, over her.  

Flash forward to our senior year.  This past February to be exact.  I had long since wanted to give being friends with her another shot, but I was always too scared of falling for her again.  I finally caved and gave it a chance.  And for two months everything was great.  Then it all came back.  She had a new boyfriend.  Not a great guy.  Then in May she told me he had dumped her.  I was ecstatic, which as a friend made me feel horrible.  But things were looking good  for me.  We were both taking another semester.  I had more time with her.

I tried seeing her several times over the course of this summer to ask her out.  Our schedules never quite lined up though.  We finally managed to grab dinner Thursday.  I was gonna ask her out afterwards.  But not long into dinner I found out they had gotten back together.  I was devastated.  The last couple days have been absolutely unbearable.  I really thought I had a chance which is hard enough on its own, but its worse knowing that this guy has hurt her before and will do so again.  I think I need to cut things off for good this time.  I would love for us to be friends, but I know better.  I won't stop feeling the way I do with her around.  Should I let her know why I'm cutting it off?

The thesis of Erich Fromm's The Art of Loving is a compelling lead into a very mature treatment of the concept of love that still has me reeling three years after first reading it. The idea of ""true love"" being grounded in the reality of a platonic acceptance of, concern for, and identification with people in general is so radically different from the confused jumble of concepts I have variously associated with the word, ""love"", that I still haven't fully incorporated it into my everyday thinking and interactions with others. 

This is something I intend to work on, starting with telling my friends and family that I love them.

And on the first day of my new school, I met this girl. (Let's call her Sally) So on my first day, I ate my lunch alone, and then went outside to listen to music on my phone, and as I was doing so, Sally approached me. ""Why are you alone?"" She asked me. Me being the shy person that I am, it took me a while to respond. I was wondering why such an attractive individual had spoken to an obvious new kid. I soon replied with, ""I'm new here so I don't have many friends."" After I said that she immediately replied with, ""Well, you do now."" Then things just progressed from there, and I felt myself gradually falling in love with this girl as time went on. 
  
   A few months later, January or so, I felt it was time to confess to Sally. When I decided it was time, I approached her during our lunch hour, and as soon as I got up to her, she said, ""Hey, guess what?"" And naturally I replied, ""What?"" She then preceded to tell me about her new found boyfriend. Yep. So after that I died a little bit inside. The relationship that she had, it pains me to say, lasted longer than I had hoped. It lasted until about April/May. And I still had the biggest crush on her. As the last day of school approached, I realized it was now or never, but I just couldn't do it. On the last day of school, when everyone was signing yearbooks I decided to write her a note that was basically a confession and all the things I love about her (It was about a 3 page note.) 

   After school had ended, she texts me telling me that she read the note and she thought about me the same way, but she just couldn't tell me, I was extremely surprised, because I didn't think that would ever happen. So as the new school year is approaching, my question is: What can I do better to ensure that I can make her mine? Thanks for taking the time to read this, I really appreciate it.

I've been together with my girlfriend for three months. I've known her through some mutual friends in middle school. We never actually had talked as friends back then. I would call her mean names and make fun of her. Then Freshman year comes and we have Biology and Geometry together. I barley remember the poor girl for some odd reason. We barely talked through most of the year until one day in Biology we both get up to wash our breakers. We bump into each other and we just stare at each other. It was an odd, yet magical feeling. We stared into each others eyes for about a minute. We both walk away awkwardly, my heart was beating so fast. Then we started talking more and more. I had just gotten out of a relationship, and I was chasing after my ex. (Long Story). We would talk and I knew I had liked this girl, because I became so jealous when other guys would talk to her. Then reality hit me. I had to stop chasing after my ex and go for this girl. It's March 29th, and there's lock in at our school. My friend and I had just dealt with a depressing and scary situation. Our other friend(Whom we've known for about two years now, and we've gotten close.) Was planning on killing himself. After 8 hours of talking we talked him out of it. To get our minds off of the stress we decide to go to the lock in and have some fun. We go and I see her. I tell my friend that I planned on kissing this girl. I approach her and we talk. We went swimming, played Laser Tag, had a game of football. And she lies down. A Junior approaches her and starts getting very close to her. Enraged I confront him and tell him to beat it. He argues, but does leave. She smiles and I sit down next to her. We awkwardly stare at each other. And I grabbed her neck and I kissed her. The kiss was very awkward, but we went on. Afterwards she bursts into tears. I ask her what's wrong and she takes my hand and says ""I've been waiting for this moment since November you damn jerk!"" I chuckle and hold her. After we get out I asked her to be my girlfriend. With her face beaming with happiness she replies yes. Now we both laugh how things ended up. I made fun of her during middle school and now we're dating. These feelings I have for this girl are unexplainable. I've never loved someone so much. She's perfect. She's incomparable. She's all I could asked for. We've gotten serious. She feels the exact same way for me. I know we'll be together forever. I just know it. Although I've moved, we currently have a long-distance relationship but it's manageable. I don't live so far and we both are getting licenses soon.

1365144250.0,5,self.love,1bpwuj,Need Serious Relationship Advice,xchange1206,10,5,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/1bpwuj/need_serious_relationship_advice/,"Hi Reddit /love,

Sorry if my salutation is wrong, I don't usually write posts in Reddit, I'm more of a reader and upvoter. Just a little background on my self: I'm a 22 year old Asian, pardon me for my grammatically erroneous sentences, as English is only my secondary language (ESL, as we call it in Canada). I wouldn't say I'm ugly, I would say I look average (at least what I tell myself to help me be level-headed and not get cocky about my looks), I wouldn't say I'm a geek also, but I do love technology and computers, however, I'm also into sports (huge Basketball fan) and used to play Basketball for my university and high school. I would say I like being adventurous and spontaneous (I'm Sagittarius), I'm also outgoing **but** I'm a shy person. Pretty odd combination of characteristics, or is it only me that thinks so? I have one best friend that I usually talk to about my love problems, but he is currently out of the country until the end of the month. So I thought to myself, why not try the reddit /love community. The reason I only have one friend to talk to about love problems is mainly because of privacy issues and maturity (most of my friends or even people my age don't look for serious relationships yet, thus can't offer mature advice).




I've been with my girlfriend for more than a year already. She is 20 yrs old, same ethnicity as me. Although I would say English is her primary language as she grew up here, in Canada. Just like any other young couple we have regular fights, about 2 - 4 times a month direct correlation with our stress levels. Usually it's her stress that causes fights, as she is just learning how to control her stress and not take it out on me. We both agree that I have been very patient and understanding with her (she even told me my patience with her isn't worth it and I deserve better, but I just reassure her that she is worth it). However, I am a human too and I have feelings too. I do get fed up with the unjust treatment I receive from her and that's when we fight. We already discussed this as a couple about three times, that she has to try to do a better job in managing her stress and not letting her stress affect how she treats people that have nothing to do with her problems. The most recent being two weeks ago, and prior to that 3 - 5 months ago.


The main issue with my relationship is: our personal needs. We're both Catholics (don't worry, we don't hate atheists and homosexuals, we respect their beliefs just as we hope they respect ours). Her family or at least she and her sisters are very devout Catholics. They are a part of a Christian organization here, and they are active members in it. As for me, I'm just a regular Catholic, I admit I'm not a devout one and I was even starting to doubt the Catholic church (with all its rules and laws that raises questions). I had to tell her that, and she didn't take the news easily. We almost broke up because of it, the only thing that stopped her was me telling her I'm not leaving the church but just taking some time away from it. 


Also, just to fill you guys in, Catholics believe in sex after marriage only, in other words; no sex until we get married. Not all follow it, as it is a very hard thing to do, I for one wasn't able to follow this. On the other hand, my girlfriend is very firm about this rule. Nothing is to change her mind about it, and I do not intend to force her into having sex with me. That is something I would never do to any woman and of course man. I made a mistake of mentioning this to one of my friends, and it just spread like a wildfire. I was mocked by my friends, was called names, and even said things like having sex with my girlfriend, meant as a joke, but a very offensive one (forgive them, they aren't in the stage to understand what I'm going through and they do not share the same beliefs as Catholics do, pertaining to the no sex rule). Again, I had to tell her back then, before we were together but already in love with each other, that I was no longer a virgin. She didn't take it easily again, and we almost didn't end up in a relationship together. I appreciate the fact that she was able to accept me, however, she is really bitter and always acts awkwardly whenever I mention my ex-girlfriend, to whom I lost my virginity to. I don't mean to get her jealous whenever I mention her, that ex-gf of mine still happens to be my best friend, to this date (it's really nice to still have your friendship with your ex despite what happened to your relationship). But I reassured my gf that there are no feelings between my ex-gf and I, we have both moved on. Despite that she still acts awkwardly whenever I accidentally mention her when I tell her stories of my past.


**Warning, paragraph contains sexual words and descriptions** So just today, my gf and I had another argument. I visited her earlier and spent an hour or two in her place. We did the usual, but the most we do, in terms of physical contact, is ""dry humping"" and touching each other (my apologies if this is too graphic, I tried my best to word it in a less descriptive fashion). That's the most she would permit me to do. But today, I noticed she wasn't acting normal again and asked her what is bothering her. She told me she doesn't feel comfortable with what we're doing. She doesn't feel comfortable allowing me in her place without her mom's permission (their house rule, although I do know her mom well and even told me she likes me for her). She also doesn't feel comfortable coming to my place when no one else is home because, again, her  mom doesn't allow her to do so. I understand why her mom would put such rules, it's probably because she's afraid I might have sex with her daughter and accidentally get her pregnant. With dry humping, the chances of getting her pregnant are very low, and I stop upon ejaculation to make sure I don't get her pregnant. I know rules are still rules. She also told me she doesn't feel comfortable with dry humping. 


I didn't take this easily. I've given up so much in our realtionship to be with her and now she's asking me to give up even more, when she hasn't given up much for me. It was really hard for me to give up sex, until we get married (6 - 8years, maybe), and I learned how to be content with what she could offer me (dry humping), and now she wants to take it away as well. I do not intend to cheat on her also, nor with any other future girlfriend I have, so that was never a solution. I love my girlfriend a lot, however, I don't think I can give in to her last request. It's not that I only look for sex in a relationship, but I consider it as an important thing in a relationship. It's one of the few things that differentiates your girlfriend from your girl best friends. Like I said earlier, I've given up a lot to be with her, sex being one of them, and now she wants to get rid of the closest thing to sex she can offer me. I'm just really torn right now that it had to come down to this. I fear that my lack of physical contact with her will cause me to cheat on her in the future. Also, just to add, I'm also considering a career with the military (years of university education gone to waste -_-), like I said, technology is one of my interests, and weapons fall into that category. I also feel that joining the military is a good way for me to make a small positive difference in this world or at least country (one of my goals in life). That being said, I don't believe in long distance relationships, if I do decide to join the military, my training begins in a different province in the east coast (I'm currently from the west coast). I probably wouldn't allow my relationship to be a long distance one, so should I choose a military career, I will eventually break up with her before I get shipped to my boot camp.

She's a foster kid and the family she's at and my family are really close(as in their daughters are just like sisters to me and we would hang out almost everyday). that family applied to be foster parents last year sometime and finally got abby in the beginning of summer. after hanging out with her i found myself falling for her and i started hanging out with her just about everyday more than the others. they really noticed and during a BBQ one of them run up to us when we were alone and screamed ""YOU HAVE A CRUSH ON ABBY!"". at that point my mind kinda flat lined and i went inside and listened to music for the rest of the night while trying to organize my thoughts and how to deal with how awkward everything just became. i didn't see them for about 2 weeks after that happened. then on 4th of july i went over there and what do you know, she likes me too. i started hanging out with them again and eventually asked her out. we went out for about 3 weeks before she decided to end it at the beginning of a camping trip and ended up ruining my weekend(i basically sat at the campsite and listened to music on my phone trying to organize my thoughts again). she told me i was to much like family to her and that she wasn't ready for a relationship which i believed. i asked her if we could try again when she's ready and she said yes sounding like she was waiting for me to ask that magical question. then about a week later i find out from girls who were like sisters to me that she liked another guy and thats why she broke up with me. that made me pissed, sad and confused at the same time. pissed cause she lied to me, sad cause i lost her and confused cause not only she said yes to me asking if we could try again, but because she said it enthusiastically like she was waiting for me to ask. i don't have any contact with them, ignore their texts and phone calls for a while until i feel like i'm over her. for about a week we start hanging out again but abby was basically treating me like the plague so i asked if we could talk and she kinda exploded yelling ""about what?!??!"" a hundred times. so i said nothing to anyone, turned around, walked out of the house and walked home. another week goes by and i go over there on the weekend. while i was there i was talking to one of the girls alone and the relationship comes up. she asks me why i've been avoiding abby and i tell her ""to be honest, i'm mad at her"". she gets up and goes straight to abby and tells her that. next thing i know she's crying and i'm sitting inside watching tv with they're parents thinking in m head ""what did you expect to happen when you treat me like that?"" until i decide to leave. i decided to not see them for a while cause its hard for both of us and haven't seen them in almost a month. it sucks now cause i used to spend all my time with that familly and now i just feel so lonely. i hang out with my guy friends still but not often outside of school. and one more detail is that i can literally tell abby off and walk out the door while everyone looks the other way, including her parents cause they have all seen how she's been treating me, not that i'm the type of person to do that. i mean i still care for her but she makes it hard to keep caring and i'm at the point where if she asked to get back together(the other girls have really hinted at that) i would be in the middle leaning towards no or worse, telling her to screw off. and once again, i'm not that type of person.

Now for the part i need advice on....

there was another girl and i had a major crush on her during freshmen year. i think she liked me too cause she would always be messing with me but nothing ever happened cause when ever i asked myself if i liked her i just buried the question. well i went to another school the next year and haven't seen her since. then one of my friends who still goes to that school texted me he told her something(wouldn't tell me what) that she asked for my number and he gave it to her. that happened while i was going out with abby so i had to tell her that i had a girlfriend. somewhere in there i told her that i had a crush on her during freshmen year and she was really cool about it all. in fact when abby broke up with me she was the second person i texted which i kick myself for doing cause it doesn't seem right to go to her about when she knows i had a crush on her. we still text each other and she calls me names playfully like she used to and even texts me winky smilies... alot actually. and now i'm starting to fall for her again like i did in freshmen year but we haven't seen each other in 2 years(trust me i have been inviting her to stuff but its usually a few days before the event and she has plans) and i'm both scared to ask her out and don't want to until we see each other again, especially over a text. should i do it or keep trying to invite her to stuff?

went out every day since i met him.
kissed on the first date and all other days
I didn't realized he looked like Dr. Who until we were having coffee and he smiled, God that smile!
he's a mathematician, 6'6, speaks 5 languages, lives w parents, still in grad school, has a mediocre job...

Dislikes:
he knows nothing about fashion
I don't think he has ever been in a serious relationship
first kiss was not good
he's skinny (i'm curvy, not fat, but you know big boobs, butt..etc)
he's all about ""massages"" 

Dilemma
he wants to be ""friends w benefits"" w/o sex... O_o
I think i fell hard for him...i don't even understand the logic... I think of him from the moment i wake up until i go to bed. 
He doesn't call, doesn't text, doesn't email.

Last year, my friend had started a relationship with a girl. I later found out this girl is the same girl I met on Xbox 3 years earlier, she was one of my other friends' sister. We started talking, and soo enough became really close friends. Come graduation, I had been accepted at a school out of state, 2000 miles away, I promised to keep in touch, I talk to her atleast every couple of days. Recently I found out that my friend, (her boyfriend) had broken up with her for what seemed like no reason, (I still don't know the reason, and neither does she), I wanted to be there for her so badly, I would choose to be her friend more than I would want to be the guy's friend. I really like her, and have developed these feelings for a while since we had started talking almost a year ago, but with her being about 2000 miles away, I know there would never be a chance, but today, I just found out that she plans on moving here sometime in her life, I was hoping it would be after highschool, so that it would be next year, but she's saying it would be after college because she wouldn't be able to afford out of state tuition. She is a year ahead in highschool as of now, so technically if she took a year off of school after highschool and moved here she would have in state tuition, should I maybe bring this up to her? If she moved up here, it would mean more than the world to me, I'd even give her a place to stay with me (don't get the wrong idea) so she doesn't have to worry about finding a place to live.

1344734080.0,4,self.love,y2n5u,Reflections on living and dying for love,Gravizt,5,1,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/y2n5u/reflections_on_living_and_dying_for_love/,"Throughout my life there are a few words I have heard time and time again, but never quite understood. Words spoken mostly in movies, or between the brand new teen couples. A few simple words, that for me, make no sense at all.

“I would die for you.”

It sounds so romantic, so honest, and so daring, but thinking of it, its evil. It forces the other part into caring. Its a cowardly option in a possibly hard situation. Picture the following. You and your loved one are in a position where only one of you can survive. There is no way out of it. One of you have to die. Every proper gentleman would of course at this point immediately say his tearful goodbyes and face death for his love, but is this really the honorable thing to do? 

Let us work on the assumption that there is no afterlife. When you live, you live, and when you die, you're dead. Nothing more. No reincarnation, no heavenly kingdom, no nothing. This is what we shall believe, at least for now. Too set more guidelines, you are both madly in love. Your world consists solely of each other, and you are the most important aspects in each others lives. For most people, this only strengthens the notion that dying for your significant other is the right thing to do. You would want nothing more than for your loved one to live long and prosper, but is this what would really happen?

For those of you who have been unfortunate enough to loose a loved one, be it a family member, a friend or a partner, will know the pain that goes with it. The days following, filled with sadness, or even anger. Regretting not spending more time together. Thinking of all the things you wished you could have said before it was too late. Making up the conversations you could have had together. All the crying, and thoughts of what should have happened. Now imagine, all of this depression, coupled with the feeling that its all your fault. Knowing that if it wasn't for you, they could be alive. They could be happy, if only it hadn't been for you. This person, that you loved so greatly. This person that made up your entire world, is dead, because of you. You, you and only you. Nothing else is to blame. How long would you take too get over it? Months, years, more? Imagine spending years hating yourself. Living in nothing but guilt and depression. Self hatred beyond anything. Its your fault that your loved one is dead, and there's nothing you can do about it. Does this make you want to kill yourself? Is the sweet relief of death tempting too you? Sadly this is not an option. Your loved one died for you, and you are planning on throwing away your life. No, that would be an insult to their sacrifice, and you know this. So you are trapped. Trapped in your own personal nightmare of self hatred and guilt, and there is nothing in this world you can do to make it better. All you can do is live, because that is what your love wanted. Can you imagine living in this position?

Now of course you are not living in this condition, because you, without a moment of doubt, or half a second of intelligent thought, took the honorable way, and died for who you love. You feel nothing. You don't think any more. You don't even exist. Because you where a honorable person. You gave your life so that your loved one could live on. Was it worth it, only to inflict such pain on them? You didn't take the honorable path, you took the easy path, and because of it, you feel no pain. You are free.

We began by establishing that there is no afterlife, but what if there is? Does that change anything? Again your loved one is doomed to wander the earth, in the same state of depression and self hatred, but now there is a difference. Now they know, that you are in a better place, and they are stuck here, knowing it was because of them. Do you think it brings them happiness to know that you are fine and in heaven? No, it does not. They are still alone, you are still dead, and its still their fault. You will not see each other again, before they die, and go to heaven, with you. They still cant kill themselves. They would toss away your life, which you sacrificed so they could spend more time on this miserable earth. If they were to kill themselves, that would be a one way ticket to hell, and you would never more speak to each other. Now they are in a worse position, because they know they will see you again. They just have to live through their depression. In the mean time, you are happy. After all you are in heaven. Just being happy, and waiting for your loved one to return too you. Again you took the easy way out, and again you left them to rot in their own sadness. All you can do is watch them, wait for their arrival, and pray they don't realize that all their pain and suffering is your fault, for if they do, there is no way you will be forgiven. Still, the eternal bliss that is heaven forces you to watch their pain with a smile. Sadness does not exist for you. Again, you did nothing honorable, you took the easy way out.

Dying for someone is easy.

Now lets envision another scenario. What if your life was empty. What if you had nothing at all. All you had in your life was depression. You never had anything but depression. Depression, and love. You had the love of your life. For years you two were happy together. Then, your loved one leaves you. Its nothing dramatic. Your loved one just needed some time on their own. You asked if there was ever a chance for you two to be together again, and there was not.

Again you plummet into the same old depression that has been your life for as long as you can remember. You are left with nothing, and all you want to do, Is kill yourself. You don't care about what others will think, you just want to end it. Why wouldn't you? You have nothing left to live for. You tasted happiness, and now it is gone. Every day is a nightmare. Just living is a pain, and death would be sweet, sweet relief. It makes sense. Nothing is left but pain, why not get rid of it? Let me tell you why. Let me tell you why you live through the pain. The only reason you are still alive, is because upon ending the relationship, your loved one pleaded too you not to do something stupid. Your only shining light of happiness pleaded for you too live, saying it would crush them. Imagine your only reason to live is to not make your previous partner unhappy. Imagine caring for someone to the point of pulling yourself through mental and physical torment, every single day. Now why cant you kill yourself anyway? After all, I already said, when you die, you don't feel any more. Let me explain. If you kill yourself for someone else, you die with a clean conscience. You die, believing your loved one will live on happily. That is why dying for someone is the easy way out. If you kill yourself after they pleaded not to, you die, knowing you've let the love of your life down. You die knowing you've disappointed them. You die, in guilt. You are forced to live, only to make someone happy. This doesn't sound like a fun experience, now does it? 

This is the position I find myself in.

(We used to live like 5 minutes away from each other until he had to move away for college.) My whole life I have been insecure about men. My father left us when I was 3 and every boyfriend my mom had left as well. When I started to date in high school, my relationships always ended with dishonestly and yes cheating. I vowed to never date until after college. Then he came along. He tried and tried to get me to be with him and I constantly turned him down until eventually I gave in. Now 2 years later we are still together but we have reached a huge pump in the road that I don't think can be fixed..

I found out that he hadn't been telling me when he hangs out with girls alone (mostly because he was scared of what I would think.) However, he had been flirting with one girl in particular. The only thing that I came across that he had said to her was ""my day was bad because I haven't talked to you."" The worst part about it was that him and I had hung out that day..

I had never been the confrontational type, especially with men. So I held it in. I would try and try over again to talk to him about it but I could never fully finish what I needed to say and we would make up. I still would constantly think about it. I finally was fed up with thinking about how he could be hurting me and I said something to him. When I finally got it all out, he told me that he wasn't sure if we could be together anymore. That this fighting was unhealthy. Even though the only thing that we fought about was this girl.

I can't really explain it but I've never felt this way about anyone before and I don't want to lose him.

Am I wrong in feeling insecure? Has my past effected the present in not being able to trust him? Or am I better off without him?

ill start with mine then you share yours...:)

i met my girlfriend at school in 2006, she was a freshmen and i was a junior. her friend introduced us and we started talking/hanging out a lot so we decided to get together. last year both my grandparents died and i fell into depression and it really took a strain on our relationship (fast forward a little bit.) I got out of depression, we both changed our outlook on life and we became atheists. i was really happy with my life and i loved everything about it except my girlfriend, i guess somewhere along the line i lost my love for her. i confronted her about my feelings and we split up for about two months. one day she dropped by and demanded a reason why i don't love her anymore and one thing led to another and we decided to get back together, at the time i loved who she was but i wasnt IN love with her....(kind of hard to explain how i felt but it is what it is.)  the plan was to get back together and see where it goes from there... its been about a month we've together and were extremely happy, happier than weve ever been, we have learned to control our anger and how to express our feelings in a rational and mature way without cussing and yelling at each other. my love for her is slowly but surely returning. she has influenced in ways that no other women can, she is to me what water is to fish, what the sky is to birds, and to what weed is to snoop dogg.... were coming up on our 6th year anniversary and i hope we have 10x more!!

I was caught off guard and said ""Well, I thought you'd want them and I wanted you to listen to those songs..."". Regardless, she thanked me and gave me a hug- the emptiest hug I've ever felt.

My story starts in high school. I'm 22 now. Back in high school I met this beautiful girl named Jess. I was completely taken by her, but long story short I got the whole I don't want to mess up our friendship speach. About a year after seeing this girl everyday I met another girl named Allison. She was an exotic looking girl, absoolutly drop dead gorgeous and best part is that she liked me. At this point is still liked jess a lot. I went out with Allison for 2 years, had the whole first love relationship. Ended horribly. Jess hated her when we were together because we stopped hanging out as much and hated her for the shit she put me through. Jess started going out with some guy near the end of mine and Allisons relationship. They have been together for about 3 years.

Sorry for the long backstory but here's the point of this post. Ever since I got out of my relationship with Allison I have not have had a girlfriend. I will either do the one night stand thing or if a girl shows that she likes me I would just taper off hanging out untill I just stopped calling. Until I started hanging out with Anna. I have known her for a long time but through friends. We started hanging out a lot and I realized that I am actually getting feelings for her and maybe I finally got past whatever I was going through and am ready for a gf. 

Last weekend both Jess and Anna invited me to go out. I got convince to go hang out with Jessi just because she a good friend even tho I really wanted to see my crush Anna. While hanging out with jess she thanks me for coming up, that she had a horrible day, told me her bf and her got into a little fight. We had a great night. On our way back to her place in the backseat of my friends car I just put my Arm around her because it was a tiny little Honda. jess leaned into me and got comfy so I held her closer. So now I'm sitting here thinking I must have always loved her. A lot. I must have buried my feelings for her years ago and never let them out because we were with other people and when I let that feeling get out after 3 years of stuffing it down because of Anna, I go and see Jessi and all my feelings for her just broke down the gates. So what the fuck.

tl;dr  Like this girl Jess in high school. Didnt work out. Got another girlfriend for 2 years. After our break up avoided all commitment type relationships with girls. Years later meet a girl (Anna) who makes me ""crush"" again. See my old friend Jess who I have seen regularly but not since Anna. Realize that I really am in love with her.

Edit: Dont know if anyone reading it but hey if Im venting, Im venting. After thinking about it I realize that I have always loved Jess. Had a crush on her a long time ago. She is one of my best friends and has been for a long time. I think that after my breakup with my ex, I didnt let myself like any girl. I was always interested but never let myself like them. Right when I let my guard down, I go and see my beautiful best friend who is sad and comfort her and BAM lovestruck again.

So I met this girl during my Sophomore year in college that I really liked (she's one year below me). We basically saw each other every day since we're next door neighbors. She used to ask me about homework a lot and so we spent a lot of time together. I got a feeling that she kind of likes me, and I wanted to ask her out so badly but I was swamped with so much schoolwork that I didn't have any time for another commitment.

Come my junior year, I moved to another dorm and haven't seen her much the first semester. Second semester she went abroad so we had very minimal interactions.

It's my senior year right now and I see her a lot (we've had a couple classes together, and I'm even her TA for a couple classes also), but ever since she came back from abroad, she's changed a lot. 

I'm the kind of guy who wants something meaningful; I don't date girls just because of their looks or because everyone's doing it. But something clicked in me about her. She's someone special to me. 

We've had a talk and I indirectly asked her if she liked me (she knows I have feelings for her). As you might guess, she told me that she just considered us friends. At first I was ok with that, but now I can't stop thinking of her. Every. Single. Day. I still see her almost daily, and the thing is that I noticed her looking at me a lot when I'm not paying attention.

Right now, we're just friends with a slight awkward tension between us. I don't know what she thinks of me; all her close friends are being very elusive about it so that's no help either. 

I like this girl a whole lot and I want to pursue her even though she said she's not interested, but at the same time I respect her and don't want to badger her.

Just searching...",Pinkie0314,10,3,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/q7zle/lost_no_not_lost_just_searching/,"So, allow me to pre-empt my discussion with a little detail on myself. I am 25, in the Armed Forces, living overseas. I am athletic, fairly attractive, moral, an Atheist, introverted, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually balanced. At times I can be cold and hostile, but only when resonably provoked. Anyways...Here is my dilemma: 

For as long as I can remember, maybe since middle school, I have not ever been interested in 'chasing tail' or 'casual dating' or whatever. I have been looking only for love. I pursue this so avidly, in fact, that I didn't even have sex until I was 22, and it was with someone that I genuinely cared about and intended to be with long-term. Unfortunately, later in the relationship, some large incompatiblities started coming out of the woodwork.

My issue is that I am constantly surrounded by the mediocre rabble of people looking to drink themselves stupid, party, and get laid. These are their only concerns. And the few times that I actually have met somebody who I believed was special and worthwhile, it turned out that I was completely mistaken. My most recent mistake went so far as to tell me that she believed that she had found the person that she was going to marry (me), only to break-up with me, on Valentine's Day, so that she could go drink, act a fool, puke on herself, and be promiscuous, without feeling guilty. I saw the signs that she wasn't the person who she wanted me to believe that she was, but I was so taken with her that I chose to ignore them. I ignored my instincts, and thus payed the price.

The point that I'm trying to get at, is that I would rather get burned in a fire, and have salt thrown on my raw flesh, than EVER experience the incomparable pain of heartache. Yet my heart longs for that significant other. But where is a person such as myself supposed to seek the right person? As far as morality goes, I should perhaps look at church. Being that I'm an Atheist though, that's pretty much out of the picture. Being that I don't drink, and am very unfond of the places where people gather, i.e. bars and clubs, that further narrows my options. Furthermore, I'm introverted and fairly shy, and honestly extremely oblivous to the signs and hints that women give, then random encounters are kinda out of the picture as well.

I've even gone so far as to attempt to network through e-harmony and OKCupid, however, I never get any appropriate matches. After putting my information into E-harmony, it literally said ""We're sorry, but we couldn't match you up with anyone.""

I hate myself cause I started talking to you because I wanted to finally go out with a girl that was pretty and nice, but what caught me off guard was how nice and loving you really are, I was(still kinda am) desperate for love. Andbeing the dipshit I am created a mental image of how awesome it would be to go out with a girl as close to perfect as you. I didn't know that you already had Mikey at the time so when I found out I was bummed. Butni said fuck it. I thought  why ruin it and stop talking to this absolutely amazing girl, there's always a small hope that the unexpected could happen. Enter what's her face.

I know some guys would try to take advantage of a situation like that but I'm not one of those low lifes.

So the image was still there, I found myself falling in love with you, there was nothing I could do to stop it. You were and still are always on my mind.

But I still thought about you liv. I don't know what to do anymore. I have you always on my mind practically crying cause I want to be with you while knowing its most likely its not possible. Every time your sad I just want to ride my ass over there and hold you untill your happy. But I don't say it cause I don't know what you would say. So I just sit here and dwell in my thoughts trying to think of something to do so I can try to fall out of love with you so. We can be the really good friends that we are.

Suddenly, that peace breaks, and the cycle repeats, so is the way of my insanity.

Knowing this, my love is yours until time ends; death cannot retain the strength that my love for you possesses. So you see I understand now that true love is not simplistic.

I don't know how to act. I feel like she doesn't like me anymore. What should I do?

That was 2 years ago. The second time was just a few days ago. A girl introduced herself to me, which was shocking in and of itself. I would die to date this girl, and I finally worked up the courage to ask her out. Every one of her friends were telling me to go for it, that she really liked me. When I finally did, she told me that, honestly, she wasn't looking to date anyone at the moment, and would really like to get to know me as a friend.

I'm not one to complain about the friend zone, but I was sure this girl felt for me how I did her, I got all of the signals, her friends flat out told me she had feelings for me and she was asking about me. I haven't been this torn up since my last love broke my heart.

I think it makes me appear crazy :(

When I was in high school, I attended an after school class geared towards college preparation. I met a guy there, and instantly when I saw him I had an emotional experience that I can't recognize, and have never felt after him. The best way I can describe is this: if there is such a thing as a soul, then it felt like as if my soul suddenly woke up. It was as if a deep part of me was asleep for the entirety of my life until I saw him. I felt a lot of things all at once. It was like recognizing someone, but not by face. It is hard to explain if I want to be specific.

I never told him this, I didn't think it was normal enough of a reaction to mention. I didn't want to come off crazy.

We liked each other, it was obvious when we hung out together, but I pushed him away because I felt very confused and deeply intimidated with what I was feeling. Plus, he was moving to the other part of the country, so it wouldn't have worked anyway.

We lost touch with each other, and grew up to become a different version of ourselves from high school. I've had relationships and so has he. 
But I just can't shake him, I have never stopped thinking about him, and miss him constantly. I feel like that part of me is asleep again, and this bothers and hurts me.

I just wanted to know if anyone else out there know what feeling I am talking about, and if they ever found a way out of being haunted by it?

Thanks so much.

It's gonna be a bit of reading, but I just wanna put this out there.

SHORT VERSION: A girl I really like just reactivated her facebook after I wrote on her sister's wall about how I hope this girl is doing well. I have high hopes that she reactivated it for me! :D

Alright, people will probably say this is so gay and creepy, but I've REALLY REALLY REEEEAAALLLY liked this one girl for a large chunk of my life. I mean, I REEEAAALLLY like her. I can't say I love her because I've never been the least bit intimate with her (I've never dated her or anything). We've been friends practically since birth, but when we were around 10, our families stopped hanging out as frequently, so I didn't get to see her very often.

Well, I hung out with her about  a year ago (it was just one occasion and was just as friends), but I still love everything about this girl. She's got the biggest heart (does tons of volunteer work - the genuine  kind like ""Hey let's go to another country and help poor kids out""), She's extremely funny (That's kinda bitter-sweet cuz she's a heck of a lot funnier than me, so I can't really impress her with too many cunning jokes or anything). She also has the same religious beliefs as me and she's big into love/romance stories. Oh, and of course she's like MEGA cute.

Anyways, she deactivated her facebook account around a year ago, and just the other day her sister posted about this girl's birthday (which was recent). I commented and  just kindly wrote that I hope their family is doing well and that I wish this girl a happy birthday. Well, turns out just today she reactivated her facebook account!

That could mean absolutely nothing, but I almost feel like it could be because of me (or at least, I'm really hoping [more-so dreaming lol] that it is because of me). I feel like a million bucks because now I can finally contact her and see how she's doing. I have her phone number, but texting/calling out of the blue just seems too creepy since I haven't talked to her in so long. 

The only downer is that I was extremely awkward in high school (when we hung out) and had really low self esteem. Now, I'm a much more confident and non-awkward guy. I hope she doesn't think I'm still weird or anything.

It has been this way from the start. Well not exactly the start. the first 9 months were wonderful. what does this say about me? i am not in a position to really answer that question. i am here and not on the outside looking in like you are. you have the benefit of being outside of the emotional turmoil i am in.


The relationship from early on slipped into one of extreme comfort. we are both similar in political, social and personal philosophies. we both are eager to learn at the very core. does not matter what about, we both respect each others mind and when the other learned something we are willing and eager to listen and share. when we learn thing together we complement each other. she has a mind different then mine and is better suited at some aspects of learning then i and we have learned early on to play off that. she can ask me for my help and i for hers on topics. this was attractive and made us close friends early one. 


this started out as a pursue and hunt relationship. she the hunter. i was a year out of a 6 year relationship that ended very badly. I was looking to date, a horny twenty nothing and wanted to have some fun trying to forget i didn't know what happened. but it did happen and i was moved in. i gave up my apartment and a life i loved. I was in school so didn't think about what happened next, working 3 jobs and going to college full takes your attention.


she worked a lot and that is what i first attributed it to. she became distant to me. physical contact backed way off and she spent less and less time sharing with me. when i pushed her, i was told i was clingy and needy. she needed her space, she was dealing enough with personal interaction at work. worked at 3 mental health facilities. i shut up, shut down ,focused on my work. I was a student and could easily divert the energy. Of note, i had a troubled childhood, abusive alcoholic step father and my own family exploded after i left home,. I watched, as the man retired the family scattered to the win. We are not close, any of us.


When she said things like needy and clingy, i looked at my childhood and said to myself, OK, i am broken. i am clingy and needy and i need to get it together. i had been working on issues up to this point so that was a natural thing for me to do.


18 years passed and the distance grew. we are still compatible in many ways. the emotional relationship is strained to say the best. she is happy with this arrangement and other then the occasional attempts on my part to bridge the gap we live 2 separate lives. then something horrible happened. my brothers child develops autism and i do what i do best. since i have a fair among of both biology and social sciences in my back ground, i start to help him with research. I dig deep and hard into the research of the spectrum and discover something that changes everything in my life. My spouse is a text book case of aspergers.


i am reading through the literature i am thinking, wow, i know now. it is not me, well still maybe a little me, but the things i have been trying to work on that i am making no ground, they are not because of me. she has this, this thing. she is like this because of aspirers. it was a relief. i felt light as a feather knowing that i was not broken to the extent i thought i was, what she was telling me was not messed up, i am simply a normal human primate. hugs, hand holding snuggling was not a sigh of broken needy behavior. all the little signs i saw fit with this. not being able to tolerate anything but a firm touch, fabric types, so may things that on one level appear to be eccentric or maybe ""normal"" were not. they were symptoms and the all of emotional and physical stuff was not normal. what i saw around me in others was normal. what i wanted was normal.
i take the information to her. here i say, read this, it is like a owners manual, you are in here. all the things you have told me about your childhood, all the ways you are, all the ways our relationship is broken. all in this book and these papers. isn't this exciting! Now we can move forward. Sure i will read it. she never did. i would ask, what did you think. nothing. for the first year i was very hopeful. then it dawned on me, even though i had the answer, it really was only the answer for me. it only told me that i was not completely to blame here. it did not matter really, this was some type of biological issue, or maybe just a deep rooted psychological issue, both. so what. just because i knew what it was did not fix it. i was confusing knowledge for a solution.


Once this realization hit me the real trouble started. I was angry, i blamed her for my lack of emotional comfort and the empty physical life i had. i was mad at her for convincing me i was very damaged. when i reached out to the few friends i still had, she makes it very difficult to have people around. if you know aspergers you understand this. but when i spoke with them, they would look at me like i was crazy. you are the normal one here, they would say. you didn't know this? I was floored . my thoughts were to try and find a way out of the marriage of 10 years, the relationship of 20 or so years. Well this was not at first. It was fix things then it was find a way out. 


this second option happened slowly and i was not aware of this happening. I reached out to find people online, people to talk with as i sat essentially alone at nights after work. I slowly developed a circle of friends,. As time passed, my new friends would tell me that this was not a good situation and that i deserved to be happy. that i needed to have comfort.  they thought it was obvious i was in pain. then as i thought about it more and more i realized i was not only i pain but i was boarder line depressed. I need to fix things but i could not do it. It was up to her to adjust her behavior, I had adjusted mine for too long and it was obvious to me that i was not in a heathy situation.


Slowly i found myself not accommodating her behavior anymore. i was making less compromises. it was horrible for our marriage. fight increased and the intensity evolved on an exponential curve. she would still try and push her agenda or make sure things were the way she had to have them and would say no. no more. i reached out to friends old and new and got support but i could never see a path that would allow her to land on her feet. Since she was not working, her aspirer symptoms made almost any working situation impossible. she would come home from work in tears and frustrated that she could not adjust the behavior of herself or deal with the perceived inefficiencies of the work place. eventually after watching her go from job to job for years, we got married so she could have my benefits. 


But since I am the sole earner she would suddenly be tossed into a bad economy after being unemployed for 10 years. Not fair. I promised her to take care of her before i realized that there was no way that i was ever going to get what i needed in the relationship. back when i was hopeful of things getting better. she needed me, her friend, husband to take care of the world she lived in.


After two years of pushing and trying to prod her into going back to school for a masters in a field she could use outside of a standard workplace, she is brilliant, she just needs to find a way to earn a living. after 2 years of hell, i realized i was getting nowhere except causing both to be miserable. If  i shut my mouth, the house would be peaceful. since i could not find a path to fix things, this seemed like the best path. I would simply go down doing the right thing then the twist. I think i have fallen in love with one of my friends. she is very much in a similar situation she and i have had many conversations about our situations. we have acknowledged our affection for each other and how things would be better together for each of us if we could be together. i want to take care of her, like she wants to care for me. Fortunately for me, she can say no to me when i say, i will be close to where you live. lets meet for coffee. 

""I can’t afford the complication of meeting you in person"" was her last response. ""If your wife was not in the picture, I would walk today and come to you"" 
 

Now why am i writing all this down you might ask. i have to get it off my chest. no one knows except us two. we seek each other out for the affection, we share with each other. slight self delusions that we are fulfilling some needs we have. a silly indulgence for both of us. She has given me some sense of solace and something of what I think i am missing. Am I wrong for indulging myself in this little distraction I do not know. I just feel like i need something and this almost gets me there. it is better then what i had, which was nothing. it is better then ruining my good friends life. my new love is not asking me for more. i am only occasionally asking her for a little more but i never pressure her. she never pressures me. we have a stalemate.
I know there will be strong opinions on both sides. i know the arguments. i know the right and the wrong. i needed to get it off my chest so that i can atlas say to myself, there it is out there. If you have managed to get this far, thank you. Thank you for being witness to my twisted story. 



EDT:  i realized that did not double return the initial post. sorry for that. I have exposed all to my wife and my love has left from the horror of  being in love with a married man.

This happened last night, and I can't stop thinking about her. Problem is, I can't tell if she's giving me the cold shoulder. I'm receiving mixed signals. We've hung out 3 times with friends prior to the date, and we've kissed several times too. Our conversations are still impersonal though.

Now, I'm 26 years old, and experience has taught me that in these cases, the girl is not interested. But she keeps wanting to hang out, and she doesn't back away when I go to kiss her. I've shown her all the subtle expressions and gestures that typically elevate a discussion, but she's not responding to them. I badly want to know that she wants me, I want to tell her I want her, but I worry I'll lose her. I want to spend this brutal Chicago winter with her. 


It may be too early to request anything from her. She might be shy, she might want to take things slow, she might just want a casual encounter. Too early to tell. Sometimes it's easy to tell if the other person wants to pursue a relationship. Sometimes its not. All I know is that I have to endure these uncomfortable feelings until we get to a point where we can talk about things. What do you guys think I should do? Would it scare her away ?

I am 21 years old and I have only had one girlfriend, and that girlfriend was from high school. I was not attracted to her, so this did not work. We kissed once, but nothing like that ever happened again simply because I was not attracted to her therefor it was not enjoyable. 

I've dreamed of the day where I'd find the love of my life, get married, have a kid, and live happily ever after together being hopelessly in love. I've dreamed of this my entire life but I've never found true love or even false love. I've never even held a girls hand before. 

As a 21 year old, having not done any of these amazing things that a person my age should have experienced years ago, I can feel very sad a lot of the time, and I do. I feel very lonely and some times I feel like I've given up. A lot of people tell me that some day the right girl will find me, but that's never happened. I suffer from social anxiety which makes it very difficult for me to meet anyone because I'm always telling myself in my head that the people I'm seeing when I go outside, are all thinking of how weird and socially awkward I am, which makes me even more socially awkward making girls not want anything to do with me. 

Deep down, I am actually a very good, loving person with a heart of gold, and all I want to do is fall in love with a beautiful girl and give her everything I have, because she'll be the only thing in my life that makes life worth living.

For the last two years I've been a shut in because of my social anxiety and it's only gotten worse as time goes on. Now it seems impossible for me to socialize with anyone. I just become more socially awkward by the minute. 

I feel like I'll never find love, but I am really hoping that a beautiful girl out there will read this, and show me the love I've dreamed of all my life. Please, don't judge me by my cover, judge me by my heart, and give me a chance.

I've put in my email below so anyone that's interested can contact me, Thank You.

A PRAYER FOR FRIENDS

That you would know peace
As you read these thoughts tonight

That you would experience joy
As you lay your head, out the light

That your dreams would be filled with happiness
That your spirit would soar like a kite

That your heart might ascend
On wings of hope
As your soul
Takes fanciful flight

That you would never know war
Nor hatred
Nor fright

That you would know far fewer wrongs
And many, many more rights

That you, my friend
Would heartily absorb these heartfelt wishes
And smile. . . . . with delight

These, my mirthful thoughts and prayers
For my friends, one and all
May your passions always burn noble
May you answer when YOU hear the call.

Beautiful, smart, great professional career ahead of her, and we're actually from the same small hometown. Definitely the type of girl I could see myself marrying. Problem is that she's very family focused and doesn't want to leave the area, but I HATE living here. It's too hot, too dry, too conservative, and too far from places I like to visit. My dream location is somewhere in the Rockies in a cooler climate. I love winter, I love the snow and have always told myself that was were I wanted to end up. 
The relationship is new and great and still in that honeymoon phase, but she's in school 9 hours away and will be for the next 3 years. I've also recently got a potential job offer that would take me across the country, farther than she would ever consider moving in the future. But this place is like dreamland for me and the things I'm interested in. It's a major metro within eyesight of the Rockies. So many things to do year round that I don't think I'd ever get bored. 
If the job offer becomes real, I'll have to make a very difficult decision. Amazing location vs amazing woman.

This guy. Seriously.

A couple of weeks ago I was talking to my sister about how I was starting feeling a little lonely. We spoke about how I missed having someone to hold, hang out with, kiss, etc. Basically a companion. What made it more complicated for me was that I just moved to a new place and I was/am having a bit of trouble meeting new people.

She suggested that I go on the internet. She had done it too and even met her current boyfriend on there! Great, right? I thought so.

So I signed up to a dutch chatsite. I took some time to fill out the profile and I uploaded a photo. I entered the chatroom and was almost immediately grossed out by all the private messages I got.

I quit that shit right away. Didn't think of it anymore until I got an email of the website. ""You got a private message!"" I got a message on my profile. Someone found me somehow and messaged me. The message said: ""Hey! I initially looked at your profile because of your photo. You look great. Then I scrolled and noticed your favorite band: Modest Mouse. I nearly fell off my chair when I saw that! It's so unusual that people here like them, and a girl too?! I would really love to talk sometime."" 

I looked at his profile and wow, this guy is cute. 24, dark hair, dark eyes, tall. Fantastic taste in music, great taste in film, his message made me smile. Awesome! Too bad he lives about three hours away, but we'll just talk, right? So I replied, got his msn (haha, I had to reinstall it to actually talk to him!) and we started talking. We hit it off right away and had a lot of things in common.

Fast forward to today. We take our planners every week and find out when we both have time to talk to eachother. We talk with the webcam on and have a great time. He thinks I'm awesome, I think he's awesome. I smile like an idiot when the cam comes on and actually race home on my bicycle when I know I get to talk to him.

""I can be quick and honest about this. When I see you I'm like god damnit! This girl is badass. She's cute, sweet, has a sense of humor, is spontaneous, sexy cool, dresses fantastically. Wow."" 

That's what he told me today and I was just flabber gasted. I know we haven't been talking for too long but I feel like something HAS to happen. I've never experienced such chemistry, let alone online, and it's magical. I try to keep it cool, but I'm really feeling something here. I don't know if it's weird.

Basically what I want to know is

What would you do in my situation?

1342246123.0,4,self.love,wjg63,I've Never Told Anyone This Before,z3m,5,1,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/wjg63/ive_never_told_anyone_this_before/,"Growing up in San Francisco with hippy parents I spent a lot of time questioning their authority.  Whenever I had a question my mother couldn't answer she would tell me to ask the ocean.  So, when I was 24 and I told her I wanted to get married and have children ""How do I meet a husband?""  She told me to go ask the ocean.

I'm atheist and I don't particularly subscribe to that hippy crap but I believe in a transference of energy and I was willing to give it a try.  For months I went to the beach to ask the ocean to send me a husband and on the harvest equinox of that year I met the love of my life.  My mother ALWAYS had a bon fire on Ocean Beach for the harvest equinox and here this woman shows up - a belly dancer chanting native american incantations and burning boxes full of old medical records from her recently late husband.

Late - towards the end of the night - her son came to find her.  He had been up and down the beach 2x and had finally given up.  He crashed our bonfire just to get a beer and it just happened to be the fire his mother had crashed as well.  It turned out he worked 4 blocks from my job and he lived 4 blocks from my apartment.  Within weeks it was so obvious it was scary.

And 5 years later here I find myself with him in Seattle.  In our perfect little one bedroom apartment, with our 2 pet rats Seattle and Sierra and our pet bunny Snacks.  He's a glass blower working for Chihuly as an installation artist and I'm working as a medical assistant in an OB-GYN clinic.  Everything is perfect.  I love him, he loves me, we don't often fight and when we do it's not that bad, the sex is great, the no fucked up drugs or alcoholism going on, everything is great and we want to travel and have weddings and babies and love forever.

But, there's a side of the story that no one really knows about.  Or, rather a 3rd character...

Don't jump to conclusions.  I've never cheated on my boyfriend - let's call him ""Cody"".  He's amazing and I would never betray his trust...  Unless I already have.  I don't know anymore.

See, before I met him there was another suitor, I guess.  Let's call him ""Casey"".  I had just gotten off the bus to go back to my new apartment and saw him walking along.  We made eye contact but continued on until I slipped on some slick wood and crushed my wrist.  The rain was pouring down and as I called into the darkness for help he came running to my rescue.  He drove me to the emergency room and sat with me all night.  We were in love then.

He was a successful graphic designer living just 2 blocks away.  Tall, handsome, with impeccable wit and style.  I was a well known local musician and bartender at the local coke bar.  But, there were endless obstacles.  He was getting out of a relationship and so was I.  I was also touring a lot and out of town.  There just never seemed to be a good time...

One night after Cody and I had only been dating a few weeks and we took mushrooms together.  After an amazing day full of fireworks and romantic music in Dolores Park we went back to his place where I stupidly told him I loved him.  He flipped his shit and kicked me out.  

On the humiliated walk home (just a few block down from Twin Peaks), as I came down the spiral ramp from Market Street - with the beautiful skyline pulsating in the background - I found Casey trudging up the spiral clutching a bouquet in his hand.

""Thank god I ran into you!  I've been outside your apartment for hours!  Where have you been?""

""What?""

""I love you.  You need to marry me.""

""What's going on?  I need to sit down.""  And as Casey confessed his love for me I looked at his flower sadly and told him that I'd met someone and though he had pushed me away this night I felt he was The One.  Casey was heartbroken.  I was heartbroken.  I wondered if I was mistaken then.

Then the economy crashed and we all lost out jobs, including Casey.  He also lost his health insurance that covered the ritalin he had been on since he was a child and he began self medicating with speed.  Within months he had spent all his money and I found him squatting in an abandoned building talking to himself about native americans and telephone wires.

Here I found myself without Cody and without Casey, yet still dragging him kicking and screaming through the garbage to endless free clinics begging for help as he muttered, ragged, and sorrowful for what he could not provide.  I just wanted to be rid of him, to tell you the truth; but I couldn't bare to abandoned the man who had once been my knight in shining armor, no matter how dirty his face.

As Casey remained homeless and struggling Cody and I reunited and I found a job.  We got a place together in the sunset and occassionally I ran into Casey while working, as it required me to travel around the city.  We would get lunch together and he would tell me how he loves me and how it kills him that he can't give me more.

Eventually Cody and I moved to Seattle for more job opportunities and cheaper rent.  We both got good jobs and a nice little apartment.  I even went to medical school and he got a job working for a world famous artist.  Things couldn't be better.

But, meanwhile Casey has gotten his life together - slowly but surely.  He found new work in design and automotives.  He went to Tennessee, Florida, Texas, Arizona.  He calls me all the time.  We talk all the time.  And every time we talk he tells me how he loves me.  How I'm the one that got away.  He leaves me messages asking me to marry him.  And I still call him.

I feel guilty.  I love Cody.  But, I also love Casey.  I think I love Cody more but after 5 years we're not even engaged.  Things are great.  There's no complaints, but I can't tell if we're going somewhere or just floating in a placid pool.  I don't want to deal with Casey's ADHD and his on again off again speed affair.  Life is good with Cody but where is that passion I find from Casey?  Casey who brought me flowers, who came to me in the middle of the night to take me to vegas to elope.  Casey who calls me just to tell me he thinks I'm amazing.  That he dreams of my face and the scent of the nape of my neck.

Where is that?

My best friend tells me that Casey is appealing because he's not real.  He's just a voice on a phone from far away.  In reality - in a relationship things would be different and I know they would be, but Cody has never said any of those things to me.  I know Cody loves me but he's so methodical and calculating.  There's no... fireworks.

When I talk to Casey I feel special in a way that Cody doesn't make me feel and then I feel guilty, like I'm cheating on Cody talking to Casey.  I feel so guilty that I've changed Casey's name in my phone to a girls name in case he texts me and Cody sees it.  I feel like Cody would be really upset if he knew how often we talk and how we talk.  But, I knew Casey before Cody.  In fact, Casey loved me before Cody and I loved Casey before Cody.

Is what I'm doing wrong?  Is this awful?  What am I supposed to do about this?  I feel like I'm cheating on the love of my life with the love of my life.  I don't know what to do.

EDIT: So, we broke up today.  I mean, we probably wouldn't've broken up if I hadn't taken everyones advice and told him he needed to really think about our futures and give me an answer.  Yesterday he was kissing me, holding me, telling me he loves me and today he told me ""I don't want you to talk anymore than you have to.""  For the first time he is sleeping on the couch and he is moving in with a friend tomorrow.  It's all so fast.  I mean, I guess it's for the best?  I don't know.  I just feel terrible.  I can see our whole relationship flashing before my eyes.  Seeing him on the beach, at the bon fire, summer in San Francisco on hippy hill, the raccoon in our living room, the moped, the first trip to Seattle where we slept on my best friends sofa for 2 weeks.  All gone.  It's just so over I can't describe it.  I feel so empty.  Like no one is ever going to want me.  I can't believe I have to work tomorrow.  This is awful.

1338846764.0,4,self.love,ukxk2,I just want to share this with you guys. &lt;3 yes this will be a story. (new here),hiCarlo,6,2,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/ukxk2/i_just_want_to_share_this_with_you_guys_3_yes/,"It all started when I was in High School. Me being 16, and her being 13 at the time. To some of you it might sound like ""pedoish"" but hey, it's love isn't it ? 

To start things off, her parents are not around. Her mom and dad are divorced and she currently lives with her aunt. Her mom was a drug addict, her dad was not. On the other hand it was the other way around for me. (Yes divorced parents also, with my Dad being the drug addict)

Basically we met in school. We spend time together in between classes, we would also exchange ""love notes"" . We would make fun of other people that only we can understand. We loved trolling other people and she is very understanding.

Soooooo,
Our school is run by nuns. A very catholic school that has very strict policies on campus. We have been ""caught"" several times. Not doing anything dirty though, just spending time with each other, talk and laugh around.

Her aunt and my mom would be called to the Principal's office (which was a nun) and tell them to make our love come to a halt. 

Surprisingly her aunt and my mom would defend us saying 'Please understand that our kids are in love and maybe it would be cool if we still see each other since we are not hurting anyone nor the school (to some degree) ' So she accepts.

Her friends would tease us all day, my friends would also. 

We never had a fight. In our whole 10 month relationship there wouldn't be any. Because we would always talk it out. It seemed that we were pretty mature with things. Then we took the next step.
We would kiss, hug, hold hands tightly, dance to Rufio - One Slowdance and Toploader - Dancing in the Moonlight. And also make love to each other. It seemed as though everything was perfect. Until I had to graduate.

I remembered it like it was yesterday. It was the first time I introduced her to my whole family. And my family was so excited. (as me being the eldest) They loved her so much that they let me take the car and drive her home.

Then came college. I barely had time for her because of my homework and projects. Still I go out to see her. I would bring all of my stuff and we would help each other out. We would still go to movies and she would also come by our home just to go on top of our roof and lie there and watch the stars talking about our future.

After some time her friends would get in her head. (In my opinion) They would tell her that I don't love her and that I see other women in college. They would also tell her that the only thing I was after her was just for the sex. How mean is that...

She texted me if all of this was true. Ofcourse not, you can ask anyone in my university if I see other people. I said. Still unsure of her feelings she decided that we have a cool off.

So I gave her some space. I would text on mornings and evenings to greet her Good Morning Take Care and Good Night I Love You. 
So I head over to facebook just to look at her and all of a sudden her status was Single. Which made me text her this 'I didn't know you were single, do take care and I love you.'

Somehow it kinda pissed her. She broke up with me. One mistake of mine is this did not even bother me as I always thought to myself that we would still be together after this. (kind of a bump in a relationship thing) Being the stupid me she told me months ago she has two accounts. One for friends and me and one for her family. With different statuses. I did not realize this immediately. 

I would wait outside her apartment. Just look at her window. Waiting she would look outside and find me still being there. 

I would drink just to numb the pain. It was the definition of hell for me.
I would cry to my mother while drunk, and she was there too listen. Though she could not help me she had the most amazing hugs just to fill out the void somewhat, someway. 

4 years have passed. I could never let go. Lot's of girls would flirt with me yet I would still not be interested. She had a really big impact on my life. I would ask myself what the hell is wrong with me. I wanted to move on but somehow I could just not. I would text her, ask her how she has been. On the surface acting unaffected, but deep down dying. For 4 years I am still here. 

Then something came up. I decided I wouldn't be a pussy and maybe if I go to where she lives and tell her all about this I might have a chance. It was all planned. A couple of friends of mine were coming. They were very supportive. They kept on telling me to never give up since they pretty much knew how much she meant to me. Then an unexpected call comes. It was her. Apparently my mom being so worried told her of my plans. 

Here are some of the conversation. Bella I love you and I don't know why, it's pretty unexplainable. For 4 years I am still madly in love with you. Then she says: Carl, if you truly love me and would truly do anything for me, you have to stay away. I used to love you but I guess all stories come to an end. And if you really love me then you would respect my decision for you not to come and just leave me alone. Let me be. Or if you want we could just be friends.

I was devastated. I couldn't. I declined the friendship cause I know it would just hurt me more. Though I respected her wishes. Yet I still love her for some reason. 

The 5th year is coming up. The 5th year where we were together no more. Still I wait. That maybe someday she would change her mind. 
Maybe I am now crazy, delusional and obsessed. But I guess I have proven myself and to her that I still love her. No matter how pathetic it sounded. Even though she would just deny me of my feelings.

Isabella you are the love of my life and no one can take that away. &lt;3

 I'm in high school. There's this girl I am absolutely crazy about. She is everything I could ever want in a woman and more. A couple years ago, I met her, because we had every class together. We would always talk and laugh during class, we didn't care what was being taught. We would just talk about everything everyday. As I look back on this now, that year had to of been the best year of my life, it was sublime, because of her. I had such complicated feelings for her that me, myself, did not understand and still do not to this day. I would and should of, told her how extremely I felt about her, but she was dating a guy (We'll call ""Jake."") Jake had to of been the first human being I truly hated. Not because he was going out with the girl of my dreams, but because of the way he treated her. He emotionally abused her, called her all sorts of names, even cheated on her! And she knew about it. I don't know why in the world she went out with him, and continued going out with him after he would treat her so terribly. But I digress. They would break up a lot, then go out again. During one of the times they broke up, (This is a year after I met her.) I comforted her by just talking, talking about things that would get ""Jake"" off of her mind. Eventually the conversation got to the point where I told her my feelings. She said she always liked me but loved ""Jake"" more. But I asked her out. She said ""It's too soon, but I will think about it"" And I could tell she meant it. But months dragged on and she eventually went out with ""Jake"" again. I was infuriated that she never gave me an answer and without telling me, went out with ""Jake"" again (I found out from other friends of ours.) So i confronted her and asked what her feelings about me were. I asked if she liked me. She couldn't give me an answer. But this is where I messed everything up. I picked a fight with her out of anger. We stopped talking for a while. Then we started talking again because I needed to talk to her everyday or I would go insane. But eventually I would ask her out, but she would reject me and say ""I just don't see you as anymore then a friend."" So this would lead into a fight. This has been happening for over 2 years now. We just had a fight about 3 months ago, and we just recently started talking again about a week ago. But this time around I will not mess things up... I need her more then anything in the world, more then water, more then air. I literally can not move on, and I refuse to move on to any other girl. I just want to hear other people's opinions.

So here's the story: I met this girl a few months ago when we started school..she's awesome, I love hanging out with her, her smile makes my day all better, *ad nauseum*.  Sometimes (admittedly usually after a few drinks) she'll cuddle a little, or give me these great big hugs, or we'll play with each others' hands.  We get lunch all the time, get together to watch movies.  A few days ago, we lay in the grass watching the clouds.  Now here are the problems: she's just broke up with her girlfriend a few weeks ago.  Yep, you read that right, she's gay (and I'm not a girl).  She's also quite possibly the nicest person in the world, so I don't know whether to interpret what she says/does as overtures of romantic interest, or friendship.  I can't stop thinking about her, even after trying to logic away (she's gay, we're in the same very small class, we may be working together for the next few years) any romantic feelings.  Do I tell her how I feel?  It doesn't even matter if she shoots me down, I just want her to know how I feel about her.  I guess I'm worried about the fallout this may have on our friendship, she's probably the best friend I've made in the last few years and I don't want to throw that away just because of some ridiculous hormones.

Thanks reddit~

tl;dr: crazy about a girl who may or may not be into me.  she's also gay.  do I tell her?



UPDATE: Well, she told me she's definitely only attracted to women, but really wants to find someone with my personality.  Then we hugged and she told me she loved me.  I guess we're much better friends for it now, it's weird, if it's just me and her she'll be super affectionate.  It's nice.  Don't know what's really up or going on, but I guess I'm glad to have a friend who cares that much about me.  Ah well.

Today, my girlfriend broke up with me. Honestly, that's not a huge issue. I loved her, yeah, and it hurt, but I've been through worse. No, what hurts is how long I had this attachment to her. From the day I met her I liked her, and maybe a little bit more than that. As I learned more about her and got to know her better, I grew an admiration and attraction to her. It didn't hurt that I think she's beautiful, either. Nevertheless I kept her mostly in the back of my mind, sort of recognizing the friend zone. Hell, I even started a relationship with another girl for a while. I never really had that strong of an emotional attachment to that girl.

Anyway, after a while into that relationship I start to pick up on signs that my now ex-girlfriend is attracted to me. It takes me a while, but eventually I break up with the girl I'm with almost solely to go out with her. I catch her outside of school one day, and confess my feelings. She seems kind of stunned for a moment, and an awkward silence ensues between us. She tells me she'll think about it, and leaves. This gives me a sort of exhilarating feeling, as I'm already almost sure she likes me back. Monday rolls around and I see her again. End of the day outside of the school again, I find her and ask if she has a number that I can text to talk to her. She obliges, and we both go home. I start texting her, and we make small talk for a while. Eventually I address the elephant in the room. She tells me that she had liked me for a pretty long while but knew I was in a relationship already. She tells me that she actually planned on asking me out first, but wanted to wait a while for my ex to get over me because they were friends. With this, we engage that awkward spot between friends and going out. We start hanging out after school for a bit longer. One day, about a week after this starts, something happens. She kisses me. And not some silly little closed mouth goodbye peck on the cheek. A real kiss. I'm stunned and totally not prepared, and didn't even realize what exactly was happening at the time. I still remember how that felt.

When I get home, I text her and we joke around a bit. She has this perfect blend of geeky and... I don't even know what. We decide that we're going out for real now. Things were looking pretty nice.

The next few weeks are a bit of a blur. Not that much changed between us. We hang out a bit more at school. We hold hands occasionally. Maybe that was my mistake.

A couple of weeks go by. We eventually go on an actual date. Nothing big, just the park for a couple of hours. A couple of great hours. We talk and talk. It was nice being this comfortable with someone. Even the silence had meaning.

Date's over, she drives me home. No one's home, so we just kind of hang out in the car. We keep talking, past relationships and stuff. Eventually we start kissing. Kissing and kissing. Nothing more than that, but it was still great. This is also the first time I really hear from her sister; she called because she wanted my girlfriend to come home. Her sister is a silly little one. All I really heard was  ""Liiiaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar."" It was really funny, actually. We laughed about it. Eventually my dad comes home, so we have to part ways. I kiss her one last time.

She's a really busy person. She never really had more free time, so no more dates for a while. We plan one, but Mother Nature decides she needs to take a day off from sunny, warm weather to send rain and wind our way. No date. That was last Thursday.

I ask her when she might have time for another date. Her answer: this Wednesday and Thursday. I offer that we should go on both, and she agrees.

Sunday night rolls around. I ask her if she's still up for Wednesday and Thursday. She tells me that she actually has to help a teacher with stuff after school those days, so no go on the dates. This kind of hurt to find out, because I was really looking forward to the dates. Oh well. We talk for a while. She says goodnight, and I tell her that I love her. I'd actually been doing this for a while, but she had some issue where she really didn't want to say it yet. Not until she was sure that she meant it. This didn't bother me at all; I'm a pretty understanding guy. But something different happens. She asks how I can say that to someone who ""Can't"" say it back. I answer with the same reason that I gave above. I tell her that I was more than willing to wait.

""Don't expect too much."" Uh oh. I knew this wasn't good. I ask her what she means by that, and by she ""Can't"" say that she loves me. She tells me that she just means that she'd never said it to anyone before and didn't think she ever would. This was a bit of a punch in the gut, but I took it in stride. I told her that I would make it my goal, then, to make her want to tell me she loves me. With this, we go to bed.

I was worried last night. Really worried. I thought and thought about what I should do. The only thing that I could really figure was that I should stop saying that I loved her for a while. Obviously it distressed her a bit, since she felt bad about not saying it back. I decide to worry more about my week-and-a-half late Chemistry project, and I go to sleep.

Morning of today, and I feel pretty good. Lost a little sleep over the weekend because of DST changes, but whatever. Go to school, hang out with friends and girlfriend, all that jazz. She was quieter than usual today, but I don't really take notice.

After school today (Which is less than an hour ago from when I'm writing). We're standing by her car, talking. She looks down for a moment, then looks up at me.

""I've been thinking about it, and I want to break up.""

I'm at a bit of a loss for words. I can't say I didn't really expect it. But it still hurt. I do my best to stay stoic while I look into her beautiful, beautiful eyes. I ask her why exactly she wants to break up. She hesitates, and after a little deliberation says ""I just don't really feel like I have the feeling towards  you that I should for us to go out."" I do my best to stay stoic. ""Okay,"" I say. Maybe that was a mistake. Maybe I should've resisted, maybe even begged. Work out a deal, something. But that's over. I tell her that I've been through worse, which is true. My first girlfriend cheated on me. That was such a horrible feeling, so this didn't hurt nearly as much. At least she was upfront about it. We have this awkward little moment, kind of making small talk for a little while. Eventually she has to go. She comes in, and hugs me. I hug her back. As she pulls away, I draw my arm down hers, reaching and holding onto her hand for a moment before we part. I walk away to go wait for my ride.

I have a pretty big realization at this point. I realize that even though I still want her, want all of this to go away, to wake up and have it be Monday morning, go to school and have fun with her, that somewhere, in some part of her mind, no matter the circumstances, she wanted to break up with me. I don't think that I'd be comfortable knowing that if we for some reason got back together. But I still want to.

What do I do now? Do I just move on, go back into this crappy school whose list of girls that I'd consider going out with has been exhausted? Do I text her, ask her to rethink things, do what I can to get her back? It seems like a pretty sudden decision to me. Maybe it was a mistake. Maybe I was the mistake.

You know what hurts the worst? I realized something. She's a grade up from me; a senior. Not much longer and I might not ever see her again. I can't just let that happen. I can't be so emotionally invested in something like this just to let it slip away. I have to do something. I can't let go of her forever.

(first post) part 1,maximumdose,5,2,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/pxnbd/swing_dance_love_third_times_the_charm_god_i_hope/,"I don't know where to begin. I'll just type out the story of the girl of my dreams.

I met her in university. She wasn't in my classes or anything, we actually were both dragged to a swing dance open house event by our respective friends. I remember telling my buddy who I'd gone with that I'd probably only join if there were good-looking girls there. At the open house, you switched partners several times, trying to learn the crash-course dance moves being given. Some partners were really not digging the stuff at all and clearly wanted to leave,some were just not my type. But this one cute one, asian with a preppy-geek kind of style to her was the most fun partner, leaving both of us laughing at each other's clumsiness. I remember regret when our few minutes of dancing together was over. But after the open house was finished, I seeked her out before she left and asked her if she was planning on signing up and coming to the weekly classes. When she said yes, the next step was obvious for me. I'll refer to her as Miss H.

So over the next semester, I got to know her better. Admittedly, I had started to get to know another girl in my actual classes really well (Miss C). This girl, I would get close to over the next 8-10 months or so. We briefly dated over the summer, but I went across the country to work a summer job where the other half of my family lived. At first, we kept in touch via letters, emails, and lengthy phone calls. But then she called me and gave me a Dear John statement. When I came home, Miss C and I were effectively done talking.

So through all this and while that school year continued, Miss H and I developed into good friends, laughing and joking every time we danced together. She confessed to me some time later that she had considered me as someone to date. But after things started to develop between Miss C and I, Miss H backed off to the good ol' Friend Zone.

In the aftermath of the Dear John phone call, I was suddenly left far, far away from all my friends (approx 20 hour drive from home). The internet was my only connection to anyone. And it just so happened that it was Miss H who was online the most late night on MSN of all my contacts. The relationship there bloomed and thrived with renewed energy, and fertilized by near-daily conversation. I soon realized that we'd rarely gotten together outside of swing dance classes. We agreed to do more things together when I came home at summer's end.

Okay. This is getting super lengthy and it's also late...I don't even know if anyone will read this. But it's almost therapeutic to write our story. I'll finish this tomorrow during non-3am hours. =)",,False,,t5_2qhnh,False,,,True,t3_pxnbd,http://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/pxnbd/swing_dance_love_third_times_the_charm_god_i_hope/,
