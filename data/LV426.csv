1360717326.0,812,self.LV426,18ewf4,A lot of you are (rightfully) upset at the final product that is A:CM. Maybe I can shed some light as to how it got the way it is.,throwawayacm,973,161,698,http://www.reddit.com/r/LV426/comments/18ewf4/a_lot_of_you_are_rightfully_upset_at_the_final/,"First off, due to me breaking NDA, I can't provide any proof that I'm not just talking out of my ass. But I figure you'd be interested in hearing what I have to say regardless. I've been on the project for around a year and a half, so some of the following are things I've heard from more senior guys.

Pecan (the internal codename for ACM) has a pretty long history. SEGA, GBX and 20th Century FOX came to an agreement to produce an Aliens game around 6 years ago, after which SEGA almost immediately announced it, long before Pecan had even started production. The game has been in active development in the past, only to be shelved in favor of another project (Borderlands, Duke, etc), and each time it was resumed it would undergo a major content overhaul.

SEGA, naturally, wasn't super pleased about the delays, but GBX got away with it for a long time and the contract between SEGA and GBX kept getting augmented to push the projected release further and further back. The last time it was resumed, GBX outsourced a good portion of the game to outside companies. Initially, the plan was for TimeGate to take the majority of campaign, GBX would take MP, Demiurge and Nerve would handle DLC and various other focused tasks. This decision was made mostly so that most of the developers at GBX could continue working on Borderlands 2, while a small group of LDs, coders and designers dealt with Pecan.

Somehow the schedules for Pecan and Borderlands 2 managed to line up and GBX realized that there was no fucking way they could cert and ship two titles at the same time. Additionally, campaign (which was being developed by TimeGate) was extremely far behind, even as Pecan's Beta deadline got closer and closer. In April or May (can't remember which), Pecan was supposed to hit beta, but GBX instead came to an agreement with SEGA that they would push the release date back one more time, buying GBX around 9 mos extension.

About 5 of those 9 months went to shipping BL2. In that time, TimeGate managed to scrap together 85% of the campaign, but once Borderlands 2 shipped and GBX turned its attention to Pecan, it became pretty apparent that what had been made was in a pretty horrid state. Campaign didn't make much sense, the boss fights weren't implemented, PS3 was way over memory, etcetcetc. GBX was pretty unhappy with TG's work, and some of Campaign maps were just completely redesigned from scratch. There were some last minute feature requests, most notably female marines, and the general consensus among GBX devs was that there was no way this game was going to be good by ship. There just wasn't enough time. 

Considering that SEGA was pretty close to taking legal action against GBX, asking for an extension wasn't an option, and so Pecan crash-landed through certification and shipping. Features that were planned were oversimplified, or shoved in (a good example of this are challenges, which are in an incredibly illogical order). Issues that didn't cause 100% blockers were generally ignored, with the exception of absolutely horrible problems. This isn't because GBX didn't care, mind you. At a certain point, they couldn't risk changing ANYTHING that might cause them to fail certification or break some other system. And so, the product you see is what you get.

Beyond gameplay, the story has been raised as an issue several times. I can't really comment without feeling bad beyond saying that the script was approved by 20th Century FOX, and that the rush to throw a playable product together came at the cost of the story. Campaign does a pretty bad job of explaining a lot of the questions raised at the start of the game, and so hopefully there will be DLC to flesh that out a bit better.

I'll answer some questions, but I have to run soon, so it may take a while for responses.",,False,self,t5_2s5sk,1360717799.0,,,True,t3_18ewf4,http://www.reddit.com/r/LV426/comments/18ewf4/a_lot_of_you_are_rightfully_upset_at_the_final/,

Where is LV-223 in relation to LV-426? Well I have found official sources, and can now give you a confident answer.

In Prometheus we are never told where the planet they are travelling to is. When we see the mission status on screen, the destination is 'Classified.' All we have to go on is [this holographic map](http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120602134018/avp/images/9/91/LV-223_in_orbit_around_a_ringed_planet.jpg) that Holloway provides [[Source](http://avp.wikia.com/wiki/LV-223)]

Well, luckily Ridley Scott gives us a straight forward answer in [this interview](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yK2RQWumpQ4&amp;t=0m50s). Zeta II Reticuli. Does this sound familiar? 

It should.

In Alien, we are never given a name of the planet, simply that as they approach it, that they are ""[Just short of Zeta II Reticuli] (http://i.imgur.com/7vUl5.png)."" Remember that gas giant with the rings in Prometheus? How about [this shot of the Nostromo](http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100731064049/avp/images/3/31/Nostromo_LV426.jpg) as it approaches the distress beacon. 

It was not until Aliens we learn that this moon is called LV-426. So both orbit a large gas giant in the Zeta II Reticuli System, both have the prefix LV, and both have remnant of a Juggernaut piloted by an Engineer.

I think it is safe to say these are orbiting the same planet, and the derelict was one of the Engineers attempting to escape the outbreak on LV-223, only to be impregnated, crash land, and send out a beacon to tell fellow Engineers to stay away.",,False,self,t5_2s5sk,False,,,True,t3_uv6cg,http://www.reddit.com/r/LV426/comments/uv6cg/lv223_in_relation_to_lv426/,

1339411907.0,115,self.LV426,uvz6a,My grand unified theory of prometheus (spoilers),ianscuffling,137,22,105,http://www.reddit.com/r/LV426/comments/uvz6a/my_grand_unified_theory_of_prometheus_spoilers/,"So a week after seeing it, I was sitting on the toilet trying to make sense of it all. This is just my theory, I appreciate constructive criticism. So here we go:

1. Engineers ""seed"" loads of planets, as seen at the beginning - not just Earth, using ""green"" goo seen in the head room. This results in lots of Earth like planets with humans or similar analogues evolving all over the universe.

2. Engineers sit back and observe from afar. After many millions of years, for motives unknown, decide to clear their creations using the black goo which turns life forms into murderous mutants (like Fifield). They head back to their seeded planets and start bombing with black goo urns.

3. But there is an unforeseen consequence on the first few planets they start clearing - once the mutated humans start procreating, they give birth to tentacle monsters, proto-facehuggers (but much larger, like Shaw's ""baby"") **BUT THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN WITH THE WORMS ON LV223?** - yes - because the worms were too simplistic a life form to develop in that way. They evolved into angry murderous worms, with a natural instinct to ""impregnate"" Millford through his mouth - but without the necessary equipment to fertilise him.

4. Engineers are freaking out, they never saw this coming. They go in for a closer look, assuming that they are powerful enough to handle themselves (much the same way that the marines in Aliens did - it's just a ""bug hunt"")

5. While they are down there, they start getting facehugged and infected. In one instance, a pilot survives and makes it back to his ship to escape, with a load of egg samples collected from the planet he was investigating - only for a xenomorph to burst out of him. He crash lands on LV426 and his xenomorph offspring hangs around for a few years, but eventually dies of old age as there is no suitable prey on LV426 to sustain it. The eggs remain in his cargo bay until Nostromo arrives.

6. Meanwhile, back at the ""military base"" on LV223, all hell is breaking loose. The rest of the engineers are getting reports that the unforeseen xeno outbreaks are worse than they thought. The planned mission to ""our"" earth is put on hold. 

7. Meanwhile in the confusion, a panicked engineer accidentally becomes contaminated with black goo. He tries to hide it from his colleagues, but eventually they realise what's going on. Remember the first recording that David triggers - we see a bunch of engineers running, the final one decapitated by the door. The others were *actually running from him*. They close the door just in time to save themselves. 

8. Locked in the head room, they can only wait for death. It's too dangerous to go back outside. Instead they use their creativity to build a mural on the wall - a xenomorph. Contrary to what many of us believe, this is actually a warning to anyone who finds the room. Leave this goo alone, or this is what you get out of it.

9. The rest of the engineers are killed by their colleagues - only the angry pilot manages to get himself into hypersleep before it's too late.

10. Two thousand years later he is awakened by David and Weyland. He doesn't really understand what David is saying - after all, David's attempt to ""communicate"" is a best guess at their language, pronunciation etc. All he sees are his creations, the last he heard was that they were all mutated into murderous beasts, contaminated with a biological clusterfuck of a weapon gone wrong. His only choice is to kill them before they mutate, or give birth, or whatever.

1338901111.0,112,self.LV426,ulzzb,My take on Prometheus (many spoilers),mrpinchy,134,22,83,http://www.reddit.com/r/LV426/comments/ulzzb/my_take_on_prometheus_many_spoilers/,"Saw this last night in Imax 3D. Really enjoyed it, although I'm going to go back to watch it in 2D because I think the beautiful cinematography warrants seeing it as a ""regular film"" (and plus I just want to watch it again). I've read some very mixed and confused reviews about Prometheus, and after reflecting on it although there are some inconsistencies (mainly to do with the obvious cutting, it should have been at least 30 minutes longer) it is a superb film and well worthy of the Alien canon. 

*SPOILERS GALORE BELOW THIS POINT*

So, firstly my take on the plot. The engineer at the beginning of the film (""Adam"") is seeding the Earth with engineer DNA. He takes the black goo, which disintegrates his DNA and allows it to propagate on Earth. The engineers return to Earth at various points to check up on the progress of their seed. This is pretty well established, and follows on from various interviews I've read with Ridley Scott talking about ""Chariot of the Gods"", the Erich Von Daniken book from the 70s about how humans are descended from a space faring race. 

Flash forward to the future and Weyland Tech is subsidising a trip to LV-223 to investigate what the star maps are pointing to. Clearly this is so that Weyland himself has one last roll of the dice to try and extend his life (one of the many Blade Runner references throughout: ""I want more life, fucker""). Quite a few people seemed to be confused about why the medical-pod was setup for a male rather than female, obviously it's been brought along for Weyland, as has Vickers' escape pod. They land, find the goo and get back to the ship just before the storm (awesome scene). This brings us to the bit that most people seem to struggle with, what is the black goo?

My take is that the goo is a catalyst for life, and death. Adam uses it at the beginning to create life, but the outpost on LV-233 is a cache / research centre to develop the goo as a biological weapon. The goo changes the host into something else, a killer, and the way it changes the host depends on how they are infected. Look at the evidence: Fifield is infected from direct contact with the goo, goes insane and is killed. Holloway is fed the goo by David (on the orders of Weyland) and becomes infected from within, after impregnating Shaw. She incubates the seed inside her and pulls it out as it's gestating. This then impregnates the last engineer in the standard Alien way (seed down throat) which creates the proto-xenomorph that we see at the end. So, the goo is a weapon and we have been seeded on Earth to be the hosts of that weapon, hence the reason that the engineers are sending the ship back full of it. 

I thought the subtext to the storyline was subtly brilliant in many ways. The main themes are to do with creation, parenthood and, as with Blade Runner, what it means to be human. Taking creation first, the engineers created us and we created David. This sets up an ongoing theme throughout the film about what it is to be ""human"". There are many examples of this - the conversations David has with the crew, specifically Holloway, the exchange between Vickers and Janek when he ""just wants to know if she's a robot"".  Just like the replicants in Blade Runner, David is actually ""more human than human"", he shows more emotional depth than the rest of the crew- look at the way he stares reverentially at Weyland, his “father”. If we know that we are not a form of pure evolutionary Darwinism (""You want to throw three centuries of Darwinism out of the window?"") and in fact we are another being's creation (just like David) then how different is our existence to his? The engineers created us and we created David and just like the replicants, how much ""more human"" are we than our creations? In many ways LV-223 is out Voight-Kampff, and we fail the test. 

The mission Prometheus is on is also a quest for our parents, or more specifically, our fathers. Just as the first Alien films are about motherhood and birth (the Queen alien, the aliens gestating inside the hosts) Prometheus is about fatherhood. This goes right down to the way the engineers look, they are huge, muscular, silent creatures, just as many children see their fathers . Fatherhood in Prometheus is about creating something in your image that becomes something else (just as the goo changes its host into something different) and in the end becomes a threat that has to be destroyed; “A king has his reign, and then he dies. It's inevitable.” Ridley Scott is saying, if god can be killed, then god is dead. 

For me Prometheus shows Ridley Scott is still a wonderful sci-fi director. He picks up the big themes and creates films that entertain as much as they make you think. I think Prometheus will be looked back upon as a classic, I already consider it one.

I loved the story, effects, sound, music, acting, the horror, etc. Yet I can't find a single person online that actually agrees with me. Sure, some characters make some bad decisions, and not everything was explained as much as some might have liked, but I don't recall seeing a movie that was picked apart for every tiny thing THIS much in a long time. Why is everyone so harsh on this movie? It's the best summer blockbuster I've seen in years, despite its minor (in my opinion) flaws.

Excluding the hypersleep in which she was unconscious, Ripley didn't really live for as long as it seems after first contact with the Alien.

In Alien, Ripley's consciousness of being awoken from hypersleep on board the Nostromo by the homing beacon signal of the Derelict, to the moment she goes back into hypersleep aboard the Narcissus takes place between June 3rd and June 6th, 2122, a mere 4 days.

In Aliens, Ripley and the Narcissus are found approximately May 16th, 2179. The main storyline of Aliens takes place between July 8th: when Ripley is informed of what happened during her extended sleep and of the issues on LV-426, and July 28th, 2179: when she and the survivors of the Colonial Marines mission to rescue the civilians at Hadley's Hope enter hypersleep again on board the Sulaco, approximately 21 days later.

Finally, Ripley's consciousness in Alien^3 begins on August 9th, 2179 after the emergency pod jettisoned from the Sulaco crash-lands on Fiorina 161, and ends with her suicide 4 days later on August 12th, 2179.

All in all, by my best calculations, that renders 29 conscious days in which Ripley transforms from an innocent prude to a battle-hardened, yet damaged antihero in her epic fight against the Alien creature in all it's forms and across many warzones. 

I find this depressing, terrible, chaotic, mildly claustrophobic, and supremely entertaining. The thought that the last month of her life, Ripley was more or less in hell, in a constant struggle for survival adds a very disturbing human tone to the character and a painful empathy to her story. Add to this the final scene in which despite her best efforts, death was still inevitable, only to be brought on by her own action in a selfless suicide, and the saga is worth of comparison to any great classical Greek tragedy, in my opinion.

 I may be one hell of a Slowpoke for only recently coming to this realization and conclusion, but I felt as though you all here might enjoy the insight.",,False,self,t5_2s5sk,False,,,True,t3_sxygw,http://www.reddit.com/r/LV426/comments/sxygw/the_last_29_days_of_ripleys_life/,

The scanner that Shaw uses to analyze the decapitated engineer, blinks ""DNA match"". Now some interpret this to mean ""exact match"", but I doubt it.

If you were analyzing alien DNA, wouldn't you first compare it to our own on a broad scale?

From what I recall, the DNA map that pops up resembles a streamlined karyotype, which just shows that their chromosomal structure is a match to ours; 26 chromosomes of the same size and arrangement. This is an excellent plot device, as it shows we are very similar to the Engineers, but as most of you would hopefully understand, genetics are much more than a general chromosomal arrangement. Billions of possibilities still exist, before one even takes the epigenetic system of gene expression into account.

Therefore, the DNA match scene, does not represent a plot hole, but is apparently an excellent litmus test for the audiences knowledge of basic genetics.",,False,self,t5_2s5sk,False,,,True,t3_uxzfj,http://www.reddit.com/r/LV426/comments/uxzfj/simple_genetics_fact_most_seem_to_be_overlooking/,

---

From the *Aliens* commentary track:


&gt; *David Fincher did a really good job photographically and so on. I think it's really a well-made film, visually. It's just kind of a slap in the face of the fans who invested in Newt and Hicks and all of those character relationships. I understand the instinct, of course, which is you have to make it your own. I just don't think you should make it your own at the expense of what people like, personally.*

&gt; *But everybody's gonna make their own decisions. I had to change some things and make it my own on my film. And I know that Ridley probably watched it and wasn't pleased with a lot of things. He probably wasn't pleased with the fact that he hadn't made it. But I think it's tough. It's tough to see somebody continue on something that you've started. But then you learn to just get over it because that's the nature of this business.*

&gt; *I think the trick to this type of film is you just take it utterly seriously. You don't step outside yourself and try to have fun with it and wink at the audience. You take it absolutely seriously and you don't give the audience a chance to question it. And if the actors can sell it, then it works.*

---

And here are his [parting words](http://i.imgur.com/HY9pFSu.jpg) from the commentary (literally the last thing he says):

&gt; *I think in terms of actual technique, it's* [Aliens] *crude compared to films made now. But I think in terms of storytelling, it's as good as I'll probably ever be, which is really what filmmaking is all about. It's about the people, it's about the relationships...*

&gt; *Of course, then they made the third film and killed everybody*  [laughs].

Now one of ""pups"" does go down into the well and gives it a scan but we never get to see what's at the bottom Not with the pup, or at the 3D map on the Prometheus. What do you think was down there?

I recall a similar device was story boarded along with the pyramid in Alien but never filmed, does anyone recall where they were going with this well-idea?

2) Before Fifield and Millburn meet their fate, Janick has a bit of fun with them and tells them they gotta keep their helmets on. He returns to let them know about a ping he found; a life form. Now the pup that picks up the life form, was stuck behind the door that led to the cargo room, which then led to the pilot's chamber.
What life form was the pup reading? Janick tells the boys that it must be a glitch cause the pup does it more than once, reads a life form, and then loses it. Do you think, the pup is picking up the last Engineer's very faint, but still beating heart that's been asleep for two-thousand years, or could it be picking up the life form that destroyed all the engineers, the thing that burst from their chest and through the cryo-sleep-chamber glass?

Bonus! 3) Maybe the worms that are already found in the ""head"" room had something to do with what ultimately killed all the engineers? Ford's character remarks how the engineer's head is in a fascinating state of preservation. Perhaps the meal-worms were some how kept from further mutating by being in that sealed off room?

It's a stretch, and kind of goes against what I believe the ""head"" room is actually meant for. I kinda really like the space-jesus theory, and if you think of man's naturally inquisitive behavior, if the engineers had successfully sent that ship down to earth, I think humans wouldn't know what they had on their hands and like the Prometheus crew, would want to explore and take various urns out of the ship. If for some reason the planet is inhabited by a bunch of Shaws; who don't want to touch anything then the meal-worms are there as a just in case measure. The atmosphere in the room gets fucked with, the worms start coming up to the surface and the urns start melting. Perfect security alarm really.

Annnyways, those are just some ideas that were floating around. Was hoping someone could comment, elaborate further or shoot-down any of 'em",,False,self,t5_2s5sk,False,,,True,t3_zvyt8,http://www.reddit.com/r/LV426/comments/zvyt8/rewatched_prometheus_last_night_and_two_things/,

The Special Edition has multiple scenes which weren't included in the original theatrical cut, obviously, and most of them are great and add to atmosphere and excitement of the film. However, early on in the film, there's a sequence set on the colony, ""Hadley's Hope"", before the xenomorph infestation and the discovery of the Derelict. Although this sequence is initially interesting, with subsequent viewings, I've found it weakens the film overall by removing some of the suspense elements. Of course we *know* it's the xenomorphs that have caused the loss in communications, I mean the movie is called **ALIENS**. But the gradual discovery of the situation by the Marines is clearly stronger without the initial colony sequence: Ripley's briefing, the acid burns, finding the face-huggers in the lab, the magnificent hive sequence, etc.

So my recommendation is that when you're watching the Aliens: Special Edition, just skip the early colony scene...it just makes the film better. It moves perfect to *perfection*.

The Aliens physical characteristics have been fluid over time in the Alien universe, as well as the implied life cycle, origin and inteligence of it.

Its first appearance can be seen as its classic interpretation. Black and silver, hard cased and glistening. Ash hints at its silicon origin but this is never conclusively stated to be carbon based or silicon based, only that it can replace cells with polorised silicon. The face hugger points to a conventional biology but the adult had a shiny and mechanical appearance pointing to the otherness of silicon. It also seems to grow with out eating possible taking nutrients from the atmosphere. It certainly does not seem to kill for food.

The intelligence is never truly investigated but it seems to be smart enough to navigate the Nostromo and also hide in the Narcissus. When hiding in the escape pod it seems to slowing and hibernating as it has to be forced out of its hiding place. This hints at a short violent life, a matter of days – either an adaptation to the vastness and loneliness of space or a safety mechanism if it is a biological weapon.

The life cycle of Aliens fleshed out with the Queen and also its remoteness from the derelict as a location seem to position the alien as a fully evolved life form rather than weapon, adapted to live in space. Although the Aliens are seen resting they are quick to come to action when the nest is attacked with none of the hibernation of decline seen from the first film. It has instincts to nest with and have an affinity with technology. The Queen can operate lifts either through intelligence or through copying Ripleys movements. The Queen is the first time we see the Alien communicate when she beckons the warriors away from Ripley and Newt and she seems able to sense rudimentary emotions through threats.

The appearance of the Alien is in some ways more human with the less slender body but less human hands and feet. This can simply been seen as artistic license or an evolution of the Alien.

Alien 3 has a major departure from the classic look of the Alien. It removes the back pipes, deuces its size and changes its colour to shades of brown. The most apparent change is the 3rd hinge to leg mirroring its dog host. This also adds to its adaptability taking not just environmental cues such as atmosphere but a more physical biological element to the Alien. Just as it needs a parasitic host to seed itself, it now needs this to grow as a species. Its asexual reproduction being counterbalanced by the host providing diversity. This Alien is more blood thirsty and also less intelligent than the Queen and maybe the warriors in Aliens. It is literally more animalistic because of its host. Alien3 adds to the communication as the dog alien can sense the unborn Queen. This could be direct through senses not shown or non dirct through hormones from Ripley.

Alien Resurrection shows the Alien is capable of higher though when a team of them sacrifice the weakest to burn a hole out of their pen on the Auriga. They are shown to be smarted than the crude conditioning that the scientists try to implement with cooling shocks. Another emotion shown is fear when weakest Alien is killed – it visible shies away from the others and hisses in defence.

Resurrection keeps the 3 hinged leg of Alien3 even though there is nothing left of the dog based biology of the Alien. The monsters of this film are drived from the queen embryo in Riply's blood sample from 3. While this is at odds with the creatures earlier appearance it could explain the more biological and slimy rather than wet look of the Alien, a mongrel just like the resurrected Ripley. When one explodes it is visibly more organic with organs spilling out rather than the clean limb breaks from Aliens. This is also the second film that shows the Alien spitting acid, some thing that is missing from all other films except for 3.

The two AvP films (Canon or not) do not really add to any discussion – the first cannot even contain a single design with animatronic and electronic rendered aliens having different leg designs. AvP:R shows categorically that a human host is not needed and that the Aliens life cycle could be determined by that of its host in some way. The “Predalien” laying multiple eggs orally itself with out the need for an egg or face hugger.

Prometheus I will not even discuss as the ALien has not yet been seen and is so open to interpretation. It seems clear that this is an artificial life form, derived as a weapon, but that it could be ainterpretation of an earlier species shown in the murals in the temple.",,False,self,t5_2s5sk,False,,,True,t3_15hw8w,http://www.reddit.com/r/LV426/comments/15hw8w/the_alien_physiology_and_psychology/,

The mural on the wall of the Big Head Room essentially confirms that the xenomorph already existed, and that the engineers were well aware of the creature when they adorned the room, if not outright built the complex. In the least, xenomorphs had been created or birthed at least two thousand years ago, before the deaths of the Engineers as seen in the movie.

Makes me wonder if the alien that we know and love from the existing movies are what come from humans, and not Engineers, which would explain the difference in appearance.

Seiko was serious enough about the resulting product that they signed on to the movie ""Aliens"" as an official sponsor.  Four different Seiko watches were provided to the main characters, two of which were Giugiaro-designed 7A28 models.  One of these, the so-called ""Bishop"", was a cool PVD-coated asymmetric design - red, black, and white.  Super cool.

Apparently Seiko, which has been mining their design catalog for reissues, has settled on six new versions of the ""Bishop"" layout.  They're all Limited Editions sadly, only 300 pieces each.

1. The only rush would have been to get back to Bishop's drop ship, without being chased. Although perhaps some drones still would have gone after Ripley &amp; Newt, once the Queen and the eggs were out of danger...

2. The Queen, securely ensconced in her egg chamber, would have died when the reactor blew, leaving Bishop in much better shape by the end of the film.

3. Assuming it was the Queen who brought eggs with her to the Sulaco, if she had instead died on LV426, the entire course of Alien^3 would have gone differently.

**The Ampule:** 

- *(pg 111)*: ""The Ampules the crew discover inside the Chamber turn out to contain a biological weapon created by the Engineers to eradicate life on Earth but which, ironically, brought about their own destruction.""

- *(pg 126)*: ""The Hammerpede evolves from the black slime released from the Ampules inside the Pyramid when the temperature rises.""

**Head Statue:** 

- *(pg111)*: ""Ridley looked at it &amp; said, 'can we have a statue, a sculpture or something iconic in the middle of the set that celebrates the Engineers?' The idea being that the Engineers, playing the role of god in the universe, have visited Earth many times over millenia and given mankind genetic upgrades both physically and intellectual. How would they celebrate themselves? So we came up with the idea of the giant head.""

**Ampule Chamber:**

- (pg 106)*: ""The brief from Ridley was a cathedral, with a ceiling of murals, iconographic illustrations like in the Sistine Chapel, with the Creation, Armageddon and Judgement cycle,"" says Max of the idea behind the cavernous Ampule Chamber. ""And there would be an altar of some kind, without it being recognizably affiliated with any known religion, but have the basic feel of a ceremonial space.

- *(pg116)*: Inside the Pyramid, the Prometheus crew find what appears to be an altar, seen here under construction at Pinewood Studios as well as in the final film, with as its centerpiece, an arch-shaped relief of a pointy-head Giger-esque creature, which appears to have been crucified. ""That's the DNA homage to the ALIEN Giger creature, ""says Max, ""it's kind of a homage to him. They look at it &amp; speculate briefly about it. But it's not very clear what it is.""

**The Deacon:**

- *(pg 186)*: ""The offspring of the Trilobite's impregnation of the Engineer, the Deacon carries with it a mixed genetic makeup. It came from Shaw &amp; Holloway, which then produced the Trilobite, which impregnated the Engineer, which then mixed its DNA with the Trilobite."" ""We tried to hold on to some of Shaw, some femininity. It was born of a female before being born of a male.""

**The Pyramid:**

- *(pg 96):* ""Since the creators of the Pyramid, the Engineers, have periodically visited Earth, Max felt the interior should reflect that. ""The assumption was that the creatures that we developed hearkened to a strand of intellectual life that came from them, &amp; so there should be smiliarities, that you should recognize in their culture some of ours. If they're going to be portrayed as our creators, then rather than some made-up forms, the audience should be able to recognize architecture derived from classical and ancient cultures on Earth.""

- *(pg 102):* ""Max's premise was that the Pyramid could harness sunlight as well as act as a condensor to create water. ""The major ingredients for life. That's why they could take their helmets off &amp; breathe, when they got into the centre of it.""

**Dawn of Time:**

- *(pg 28):* And so the movie opens with the arrival of a massive spacecraft bearing a towering race of human-like beings, known as Engineers, who seed the Earth with their alien DNA &amp; bring about the birth of mankind. A young Engineer drinks from a ceremonial cup, then begins to disintigrate, his remains blowing into the sea and, eventually, mankind itself.""


**The Planet:**

- *(pg 67):*His concept was you don't really know there's architecture there until you get right in amongst it. And from a high altitude, it looks like part of the landscape. It's only when they get these readings of metal that they touch down - not because of what they see but because of their scanners, and that's the intrigue and the suspense of it. When they finally come face-to-face with it, there's this moment of realization that this is built.""




***My Own Personal Observations:***

- [The face at top of the structure:](http://i.imgur.com/C2dqj.jpg) was a tamper-seal warning...similar to the lids that 'pop' once opened. When they arrived, it was a humanoid face...but once the 'seal' around the ampule room was broken &amp; the amuples started ""sweating"" the ooze, the storm arrived and the [face changed to a skull](http://www.prometheus-movie.com/media/prometheusV_screencap22.jpg).

- When the 'mural' on the ceiling changes, it actually changes into the [picture of the Alien holding the egg](http://i.imgur.com/D8hxy.jpg) as seen in the 'Prometheus: Art of the Film' book *(pg 3)*

- Although not implicitly stated in the art book, they added ""homages"" of [old Giger designs](http://www.museumsyndicate.com/images/3/20298.jpg) to the lower left &amp; right sides of the 'crucified' altar.

It's interesting seeing the DNA of the final script in this one, and given a lot of the plot elements it seems to be clearly legitimate. Interestingly it does a far better job of establishing many elements that are a horrible mess in the film: they left Earth in a rush hence the crew not knowing each other. Nazca Lines on Zeus (LV-223) had been seen by a probe and a telescope hence having some idea of where to go when the moon was reached. The script has clearly gone through too many rewrites or one writer left elements in that were added by another while forgetting to establish them.

Summary as I read through:

There's an incredibly cheesy just missing the mountain bigger than Everest with the ship sequence, so it was still a script by morons.

It's established that the moon is somehow messing with the ship's systems hence their unawareness of the approaching storm and night.

Ship to team communications are jammed when the group first goes to explore the dome cave.

Shaw's the first to remove her helmet rather than Holloway, making the faith line a little more in established character (not that Holloway has any discernible character).

Fifield is actually interested in having found alien things.

We found evidence of extraterrestrial existence. Everything I’ve been led to believe was a lie""

Extra-terrestrial life causes Shaw to question her faith in some kind of meaningful way (why did they go through this script with a retard hammer removing all of this?).

This script is clearly an 18-cert oriented script that lacks all of Paradise Lost and Space Jesus stuff. I suspect it might have been edited after being leaked as Holloway seems to rape a virgin (rather than sterile) Shaw but nothing more is said about it and Shaw is directly implied to get raped by an alien med-pod's bio-mechanical tentacles, which seems rather over the top and 4Chanish .

Janek's suicide by flying the ship into the flying derelict makes way more sense- no one else is on board and he's been shot four times by Vickers.

Vickers is an android.

The script is better on the basic story and character interactions level but lacks any interesting themes.",,False,self,t5_2s5sk,1339730610.0,,,True,t3_v2man,http://www.reddit.com/r/LV426/comments/v2man/prometheus_in_the_light_of_the_earlier_leaked/,

I'd always tried to scour the text in the movie for little clues (To little to no avail), and it was great to finally be able to read everyone's info in full. The dossiers do, however, point out a couple glaring timeline inconsistencies in the series:

* Most notably, every entry except Ripley's ends with [this](http://imgur.com/pGnDf) note: ""Above was never acted upon due to employment discontinuity which occurred on 2/17/34 c.f. Document 81 under file BG97-G"", which would place the events of Alien at 2134, 12 years after the normally accepted dating of Alien. The flight history of nearly every crew member also shows missions as recent as 2133.

* Ripley's [birth date](http://imgur.com/wlp4K) is given as 6/10/03, which would make her 7 years old when her daughter was born.

Should this information not be taken as canonical, given that it arrears in the film? I am surprised that Cameron, who is usually something of a stickler for detail, would let such obvious discontinuities appear in the same film as the only one in the entire series that actually mentions a date. These dossiers are not just heaping piles of jargon either, they appear to have been meticulously constructed. They contain some nice character information too (If it's to be taken as canonical):

* Ash's flight history is strictly classified, suggesting this may not be his first mission concerning secret objectives.

* The rest of the human crew, excluding Ripley, appear to be dead-weights when it comes to their jobs with Weyland-Yutani. Ripley appears to have been put on their shit-list over her daughter.

* Possibly, Weyland-Yutani uses these secretive missions to off lackluster employees?

* Lambet had a sex change at birth (Nothing too important, just found it funny)

They quote him as saying (paraphrased) that the mural in the goo room shows a human being sacrificed to evolution, and then describe the goo as weapons of mass creation.

The idea I took from that is that the engineers goal is not to create humans, but to create the perfect Xenos, and that the entire purpose of humans was just to serve as the best stock for creating xenos. We know that xenos take on aspects of the beings they reproduce through, including maybe to some extent intelligence, and the engineers wanted the best base stock they could get for making the best xenos. This would be them, but of course they don't want to kill themselves, so they made humans in their image, i.e. with their same DNA, so that they could serve as the stock for the xenos. They then left us to develop ourselves, become more intelligent, and reproduce to the point that there was enough of us to be sufficient stock for making enough xenos. Then they were going to come and drop their goo on us so that they could harvest their large planet sized crop of xenos.

I think this is reinforced by the mural depicting the xenos in a way that seems to show reverence. It also plays in nicely I think with some of the dialogue regarding the reasons for creation, particularly the dialogue between David and Holloway about the creation of androids.
 
TLDR: The end goal of the creation of humans was just to serve as a stock, or stepping stone to the creation of xenomorphs, which is what the goo is for and why they were trying to deliver it to earth.

I only just recently got the chance to watch Prometheus and finally I can read some of the threads here to try to fill in the story that wasn't told. Anyway, assuming these 2 species share the same universe, I was wondering what kind of relationship the predators could actually have with the engineers.

In the AvP movies we see the predators intentionally spread xenomorphs for the hunt, when I recalled this I couldn't help seeing the similarity to what the engineers were doing (especially considering the murals and past interaction with the human race), albeit for a different purpose. Considering the predators' technological sophistication it's very plausible that they've encountered the engineers before, whether they are one of their creations or not. What's interesting is that for a species that values the warrior so highly, they've attained (or have been given) advanced instruments that seem to be beyond their means.

It also gives us an idea of how long xenomorphs have been around, since the movies where the mythologies clash are all present day and also make mention of similar hunts long past. Finally, whether it's simply because Hollywood hasn't had interest to explore it or for lore reasons, we have yet to see predators in a future setting, perhaps tying to the theories of creation and destruction behind the engineers. While I enjoy exploring all of this I would never want to see it fleshed out as there seems to be an incapability of making a decent movie of the species colliding.",,False,self,t5_2s5sk,False,,,True,t3_105ac2,http://www.reddit.com/r/LV426/comments/105ac2/engineers_vs_predators/,

There are two things, however, that make me wonder about the state of Earth, however at the end of the movie. The first one has been repeated by many fans of the series over the years....in one of the final scenes, Ripley and the crew of the Betty ram the gigantic, alien-infested ship right into Earth, specifically Africa if memory serves. I know Ripley says something along the lines of ""It's an uninhabited sector."", but the resulting explosion looks like an extinction-level event. Do you think there were repercussions? Aside from the explosion itself, flying debris, environmental damage, etc must have been a pretty big headache for those on the ground.

       The second concern I have comes from a deleted scene. There is a deleted scene, meant to come after the Betty breaks atmosphere and lands on Earth. The crew lands in Paris, evidenced by the Eiffel Tower in the background, but it looks post-apocalyptic. This scene can be found on youtube (I'd link, but unfortunately I can't access youtube on my computer). Paris is a major world city, what does it say about the state of humanity that it has been destroyed, and evidently abandoned? And, going back to Ripley's qoute on Africa, what does it say about an entire portion of our home planet being ""uninhabited"" Is humanity dying off here, or what?

Prometheus is quite polarizing even among fans (I for one enjoyed it but also agree that it has many glaring writing issues as well as bad characterizations and science, but overall I still inexplicably quite like it).  It performed faily well at the box office, though (worldwilde approx. $403,000,000 according to Box Office Mojo).  

Given that pretty much most of the major people associated with it are presumably busy with upcoming projects (Scott and Blade Runner 2 and a multitude of other stuff, Lindelof is producing and writing some upcoming projects, not sure what Spaights is up to, though), do you think that they will still want to make it when it is years down the road and they finally have time to dedicate to it?

I would like to see a sequel get things right that Promethus didn't.  I'm just not certain it will actually get made, it feels somewhat of a pipe dream.  Of course it is way too early to tell for certain, I'm just speculating and using my gut insticts, which I hope are wrong :)

And then there was the realisation earlier on that Ripley wanted to destroy the facehuggers, so Bishop uses this moment to divert the attention away from him and onto Burke, so as to appear as the good guy.

[SPOILERS],Genmaken,38,10,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/LV426/comments/v8125/watched_prometheus_a_second_time_this_weekend/,"The first time is a rollercoaster of antecipation mixed with hype and it's hard to take it all in.

I'm sure most fans have seen it twice (or more) and it's one of those films where it really pays off. I watched ALIEN a couple of days ago as a ""refresh"", along with the extras of the ""quadrilogy dvd pack"".

I admit I was a bit disappointed with Prometheus and this second viewing didn't change some things:

* Scientists that don't act like scientists
* Geologist and Biologist behavior (getting lost after mapping, poking an alien)
* Not a lot of character development (I still don't care about most people that die)
* Silly way for Meredith Vickers to die

The positives:

* It was a lot easier to appreciate the visuals this time, and the film really is stunning. The score is also fantastic.
* Noomi Rapace was indeed a good choice. Her character deserved a bit more insight that a mere ""dream sequence""
* David is a fantastic character he show and Fassbender does an amazing job. I wish we'd seen more of him and his origin.

As for character development, there isn't a whole lot of it in ALIEN as well, but for some reason (age, watched it several times, nostalgia?) I feel closer to the characters in the Nostromo. The claustrophobic environment of the ship also helped setting the mood. 

Prometheus deserved a longer running time, not for more action, but character development. I hope to see an extended version in the DVD/BR releases, and hopefully a sequel.

Go watch it a second time and you'll probably enjoy it a lot more.",,False,self,t5_2s5sk,False,,,True,t3_v8125,http://www.reddit.com/r/LV426/comments/v8125/watched_prometheus_a_second_time_this_weekend/,

I have a favour to ask of you, and I hope you don't mind me asking. Myself and a team of other researchers from a couple of universities in the UK have launched a new research project that I (we) would very much like your help with. 

We are trying to capture people’s memories of watching Ridley Scott's classic Alien, from anyone and anywhere in the world.  It is a self-funded project that comes from our own passion of the film. Ten years ago, [two of our team](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=martin+barker+and+kate+egan) applied to a major UK funding council to help with research costs, but it got turned down.  That happens.  But what really grated was one referee’s comment, that Alien simply wasn’t worth spending time studying. What we’re doing now is a version stripped down to what could be managed without funding support.

What do we hope to learn?  A great many things, actually, but among them these:  (1) what labels would different people attach to the film, and how do their choices connect to what they see as its most salient features?  (2) how do men and women compare in their responses to the film – a question made particularly interesting by the ways in which Alien has featured as an exemplar within feminist film theory?  (3) how does age – and also age in relation to when the film was first seen – affect people’s responses?  (4) what changes about people’s perceptions of the film when they watch it repeatedly?  (5) How do people’s responses to Alien relate to their general sense of connection with film and cinema?  This is a small sample of what we believe we will be able to learn, providing we get a sufficient number and range of responses to fill all the various categories.  And that’s the key.

The favour, then, is simply to ask you to tell other people you know about this, by copying this message out to friends, etc, to any email lists to which you belong, or by posting the survey address to web fora, Facebook pages, or whatever.  And, of course, fill in the survey yourself, if you’ve seen the film – whatever your response to it.  We are promising to make all our results publicly available.

As a redditor myself*, I value the kinds of discussion that can go on here, and genuinely feel as if you guys can help out with our research. If you have any questions at all, feel free to AMA.

The survey’s web address is: [www.remembering-alien.org](http://www.remembering-alien.org/).

I can only give my opinion of what I saw and people can either add to it or disagree but this is how I saw the whole story of the movie.

The ""engineer"" at the beginning of the film is part of a renegade part of the space jokey species. While most of the species is trying to create a weapon capable of wiping all life off a planet, likely for planet building purposes, this sub-sect started using an early version of the black ooze weapon to seed planets. These engineers were the Prometheus of the parable bringing ""fire""/life to earth. They checked in on civilization from time to time. This brings up the first main question of the movie. 

Why would the engineers make a map to the military installation?

I don't think they were intending it to be a map for human's to follow so much as a simple diagram of ""this is where you come from"" to answer the most basic question of the movie, ""where do we come from?"". They never thought humans would be able travel the stars. 

Fast forward to roughly 2000 BC and the main space jockeys have discovered what their ""Prometheus"" brothers have done to earth and decide to use the weaponized black ooze to destroy earth's complex life. In the process of preparation for take off the ooze leaks and infects most of the crew. When the crew of the Prometheus arrive we only see the husks of what their bodies from where xenomorph's would have emerged.

This is another important part of the movie for me. The ooze mutates complex life into a xenomoprh parasitic and hyper aggressive species that requires a host to reproduce. If you think about it, this is the ultimate weapon for cleaning a planet because the species only become sustainable for a generation or two before everything dies. So basically every creature we see in the movie is some form of the xenomorph species.


Rest of the movie is clear from there on. I am with the crowd that thinks that Vickers was a fully functioning android who was programmed to believe she was human, this is a tie into the blade runner universe.

Some have suggested that the proto-xenomorph that we see at the end of the film is some early version of the xenomorph form Alien on. I say it is not because it is a contaminated version of the xenomorph line that has been splice by human dna first. I would postulate that the traditional xenomorph is what would actual burst from an engineer if they are directly exposed to the black ooze with out the filter process, this is why the xenomorph we see in the film is a more flawed version.

How does this explain why there was a derelict ship on LV426 that clearly had a queen and clearly she was born out of a space jockey. The installation on LV223 (if that was the number I forget) is roughly 2000 years old. But that is the age of the installation they were not aware of the deep ship when they did their dating, so there is no way to know how old the ships that came and built the installation then waited for the black ooze to be complete are. It is very possible that when the contamination happened that one jockey was infected with the ooze and took of. His ship crashed on LV426 and a queen burst from him. The ship could have been easily thousands of years old but there would have been no way for the Nostradamus to date that actual time of crash but the age of the ship itself. So it is easily possible that the crash on LV426 happened shortly after or during the outbreak for the rest of the jockeys.

Some have gotten angry that the planet of LV223 was moderately hospitable to life but LV426 needed to be terraformed. LV223 was being terraformed by the engineers, the planet was likely not hospitable to life when they first found it. Addtionally there is no way to know how close LV426 was to LV223. LV426 only has to be somewhere between earth and LV223 in order for the engineer to be passing past it on his way to earth.

Lastly I don't think that there is a third race. The ""larger"" race where the head design comes from in the cargo hold. I think that just like humans the engineers didn't know their god or who created them so they assumed like humans do that god looks like they do so they worship that form.

Different races, but the same species.

If they seeded life on sterile planets with their own DNA, then all life should reflect that DNA one way or another. On the flip side, if the seeding went farther than that and broke the sacrificial Engineer down to his molecular essence, then what are the odds that humans would result from that primordial soup all over again?

But maybe that's the point. Maybe that's the experiment.

I have this image of an infinite number of monkeys plunking away at an infinite number of typewriters and producing Shakespeare. It's pure conjecture, but that could be the same underlying approach that the Engineers took in trying to understand their own creation. While the 'ritual' was a bizarre way to go about it, they could have seeded countless planets over countless aeons, watching these test tubes to see what resulted.

And maybe Earth is one of the locations - or the only one - that, after billions of years of life, death and but of course evolution, resulted in the creators themselves. We're the successful experiment. We're their children, in the grandiose sense of the word.

I don't know if this is what Ridley and Lindelof actually had in mind, and I don't know if it was obvious. But this is the only mechanism that makes *sense*, because again, it couldn't have been anything more than building blocks that came from the 'ritual', not genetic sequencing. You can't buck evolution in sci-fi, so it has to be a part of the narrative.

Homo sapiens weren't an automatic, weren't an inevitability. But they were a *possibility*, and given enough test tubes, maybe the insanely complicated evolutionary process that led to them was reproducible. At least, that's the only way I can reconcile the movie with actual biology, and I do hope Ridley and Lindelof were aware of it too.",,False,self,t5_2s5sk,1342480098.0,,,True,t3_wo25c,http://www.reddit.com/r/LV426/comments/wo25c/engineers_and_planetary_test_tubes_spoilers/,

It just seems like the movie couldve been way better if it had used just one or two of the crazy elements it introduced and developed them as the focus of the film instead of all these quick, awesome, and unexplained scenes.

I've always been a fan of Alien and Aliens and prior to the release of Prometheus picked up a copy of ""The Book of Alien"" by Paul Scanlon and Michael Gross. (My apologies if someone else has pointed this out before).

It's an interesting book that goes into some of the concepts and artwork from Alien.

To get to the point, after having read the book and then seeing Prometheus the entire story made sense. To quote the book, ""There's an entire subplot concerning the planetoid that's not in the in the final script.""

The original concept idea was for the crew after discovering the Alien ship and ""space jockey"" was to then discover a huge pyramid after a dust storm. The idea was for the crew to come upon the Pyramid/giant tomb like ""place of worship.""

From that point a crew member was to be lowered into the tomb and find ""weird statutes and some sort of hieroglyphics (which later prove to be representative of Alien reproductive cycles)."" I wish I could show it (but as a future lawyer/kind of still believe in copyright-sorry). Giger game up with concept art to show the Alien cycle and it is very close to what you see in Prometheus.

Anyways, I have no connection to the authors, but would thoroughly recommend the book. It clearly points to the early ideas from Alien that form the basis of Prometheus and if you read closely enough you can see hints found in the later film. 

I guess I wanted to write this in defense of Prometheus. I think many of us have intertwined all of the ideas and story lines for the Aliens universe and created our own backstories and future ideas. I think Prometheus better makes sense as what Ridley Scott intended it to be- a loosely based prequel to Alien.

1344291012.0,28,self.LV426,xsfbq,Question about Aliens and the last stand in operations/medical.,b4dkarm4,31,3,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/LV426/comments/xsfbq/question_about_aliens_and_the_last_stand_in/,"So nothings showing on cable and 9 times out of 10 ive got Aliens in the ol blu ray player. When I was a kid I watched this on vhs so much it wore the damn tape out and finally broke. I never had laserdisc so I didnt get to see the deleted scenes until a friend of mine at my first job was nice enough to make a vhs copy from his laserdisc.

Anyway, on to my question:

VHS: Everything is pretty solid and calm right up until Burke pulls his bullshit and tries to get Newt/Ripley impregnated. The two facehuggers die and shortly thereafter the aliens assault operations/medical.

Laserdisc/Blu Ray/Directors Cut: The Aliens are trying to get past the sentry guns, they get past the first pair and are stopped by the second pair when the queen finally decides she doesnt want to lose more. Burke pulls his bullshit, facehuggers get blown away. Assault on Medical/Ops.

My question is this, regardless of which version we are talking about, did Burke bring the final assault by the xenos down on them? 

If version 2, one could argue that the complex they are in is fairly huge. The colonists number 157 and subtract however many you think died to Vasquez and Drakes smartguns as well as two pairs of sentry guns. When Hicks looks in the crawlspace theres a metric shitton of the things crawling towards him, being as the facility they are in is fairly large how did they know all exactly where to go?

If going by version 1, more aliens are alive due to no sentry guns, but still the question remains how did they know EXACTLY where to go?

When I was a kid and I watched the shit out of this movie, I always assumed that if the queen is connected to every warrior/drone/facehugger in some telepathic misunderstood xeno sense. Did Burke getting those two facehuggers shot inadvertently let the queen and her brood know exactly where to go?

I used to think at first Apone burning the chestbuster earlier in the movie, its screams are what pissed off the whole hive. Facehuggers dont exactly ""scream"" per se but maybe the queen knows when one of her children dies?

Is my logic flawed?

This has really bothered me that I don't see anyone else writing about it...
the engineer at the beginning was ""pure"" hyper-muscled super-human etc.

the ""awoken"" engineer had geiger-esque skin and was mostly black. his eyes where also different. At first i thought it was a suit or something, but when they do a closeup of him after he wakes up you see the back of his head and it is clearly ""embedded"" in his skin...

it could be a few things...

maybe there are two factions of engineers? good and evil?
maybe the good ones created us, and the bad ones want to destroy us. angels and demons. would fit into the biblical stuff.

also with all the ties into ancient civilizations, many of the civilizations mentioned in the pictograph sequences have legends of ""godlike"" men that visited them and would teach them. The book ""fingerprint of the gods"" goes over a lot of this...

anyway. just wanted to vent a little. I loved the film.

While I am usually far more forgiving than most people are (Hey I enjoyed Ace Combat Assault Horizon when it got pretty negative reviews) I however did not enjoy this game one bit, Why? because the story makes little to no sense, the game-play is atrocious, and many others which I dive into here in a sec.

**Story:** as stated above the story makes no sense at all and is littered with plot holes and conflicts with the movie ""Aliens"" and I don't mean little stuff, these are big gaping plot holes, such as Hadley's Hope being intact and in one piece, along with the atmospheric processor, wait one minute here wasn't that area vaporized at the end of ""Aliens""? (i can't find the video for some reason) Oh yeah it was, so how come both the processor and Hadley's Hope managed to live? Another plot hole is how Bishops legs are still in the hanger when they were thrown into space like any other loose object in the hanger. The story is terrible with plot holes or without them.

**Game-play:** Honestly the worst part of the game for me, I felt no feeling of fear throughout the game, just walk to the objective shooting the aliens/Weyland PMC's and finish the objective. Also, why the fuck does armor exist if its going to be drained so damn fast, it feels as if the armor is made of wet paper, and the weapons are bland and ammo is literally everywhere so you can spray and pray all you want basically. the only ammo that is sparse would be Hudson's pulse rifle, ammo doesn't really spawn until the last level to my knowledge.

**Multiplayer:** I played one match of team deathmatch and overall the multiplayer is decent at best, so nothing more to say here.

**Overall:** This game is a flaming bag of dog shit on a porch, and the pranksters are Gearbox. the story is horrendous, the game-play is revolting, and I hope any publisher in the future avoids asking Gearbox if they want to make a game, as they clearly shown they can't handle the responsibility to do so.",Misc,False,self,t5_2s5sk,False,,,True,t3_1an08x,http://www.reddit.com/r/LV426/comments/1an08x/just_finished_aliens_colonial_marines_my_thoughts/,
