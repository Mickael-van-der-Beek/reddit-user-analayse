1269326732.0,317,self.Health,bgyy5,Hello Reddit! Just wanted to let you know that yesterday I had 41 Million Adult Stem Cells injected into my spine to hopefully fix my disc degeneration. Wish me luck guys!,,404,87,156,http://www.reddit.com/r/Health/comments/bgyy5/hello_reddit_just_wanted_to_let_you_know_that/,"I've been suffering from some pretty severe lower back pain and leg pain, all attributed to disc degeneration and a herniation (look it up for more details). So I decided to try something new: STEM CELLS! They are not embryonic... they are my own adult stem cells from my bone marrow. I'm betting on stem cells being the next leap for medicine. Lets hope it's true! 

EDIT: Wow thanks for your wishes guys! Some people have questions on the treatment so i'm posting my [forum thread](http://www.spinepatientsociety.org/forum/emerging-spine-surgery-technologies/ill-regenexx-stem-cell-therapy-guinea-pig-1149/) on the whole thing. 

A few answers to your questions:

* Stem cells are taken from bone marrow from both hips (the process is painful as hell).
* They are harvested for 3 weeks
* They are injected directly into the damaged disc using live x-ray.. it's actually a really complicated process and it hurts like hell!
* The clinic is in colorado, and they're having a few issues with the FDA because the fda is claiming that this is medicine and should be regulated.. the clinic claims it's not because it's a process using your own cells. Btw they are the clinic with the longest track record with the process.. so i'm a little optimistic. EDIT 2: apparently the fda issue was a confusion.. they did not send a warning letter, but more of an 'untitled letter' which has no formal effect. The guys that brough up the fda issue have issued this [statement](http://celltherapyblog.blogspot.com/2010/03/errata-statement-re-regenexx.html).
* I'm taking oxycodone to manage the pain after the stem cell re-injection procedure.

EDIT 3: Here's my [blog!](http://healingmyback.blogspot.com)

EDIT 4: I'm 2 days into my stem-cell re-injection. It seems that I have a couple of muscle spasms in my lower back (at least that's what I think).. I'm trying to calm them down before they cause any unnecessary pressure on my discs. Any tips on calming down my lower back muscles without using any medicine (i'm not allowed to take anything)?",,False,,t5_2qh9z,True,,,True,t3_bgyy5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Health/comments/bgyy5/hello_reddit_just_wanted_to_let_you_know_that/,

I'm sorry I didn't post sooner, but needless to say it has been a hectic day.

I'd like to start off by thanking everyone who saw, upvoted, or commented on the original post.  I owe you my life.  I don't think that I can ever express the amount of gratitude that I feel for the support and concern of strangers who had nothing invested in the situation, and could have easily chosen to ignore the post.  It is because of you that I may be able to see my 20th birthday.

I explained the situation to a friend and she was able to arrange a friend of hers to take me to KC.  As per the advice provided, I skipped the ER and checked myself in.  Poking, prodding, and scanning later, I have a diagnosis:

I have a brain tumor.

I didn't really absorb the specific science-y details he went over, but he seemed optimistic that it might be operable, at least to remove some of it, based on where it is in my brain and other things.  I have been scheduled for a biopsy to determine whether it is cancerous, and I will post the results whenever I get them.  I'm not really sure about anything else that's happening at this point - I'm mostly just going wherever they take me and doing whatever they tell me to.

The doctor said that **I could have had an aneurysm at any time and died without any notice**.  He also said that, since I wasn't experiencing many noticeable symptoms that would specifically point to a tumor (like hearing and vision issues, seizures, or muscle weakness), it could have metastasized before I found it necessary to seek treatment.   Again, I could have died tomorrow had you all not expressed such pressing concern that I get help ASAP.  I don't know how I'll ever be able to repay all of you, but I want to make sure you understand how much this has mattered to me.

Thank you.

My mother (age 58) who was a previous lung cancer survivor was typically short of breath and simply wrote off that symptom, that only left the burning stabbing pain in her upper back that got progressively worse over a period of **12hrs** to indicate a heart attack was imminent.

It comes out to around $850 per month for 3 people. The deductible for myself and my son is roughly $5000 per year.

We took our son to the hospital for a 1 night stay that included one or two antibiotic IVs and a lung scan (CT?). The price came to around $13,000, which was billed to the insurance company. The insurance haggled the price down to $6000, but we still had to pay 50% due to the deductible.

Today I went to a new family doctor for a referral to an endocrinologist. I filled out the required paperwork at home and waited for my turn. The doctor came into the room, asked a total of 5 minutes worth of questions, then I was on my way. 5 minutes is all the visit took. The price they are going to charge the insurance is well over $200. The cash price for this ""new patient setup"" visit would have been $190 without insurance. From my calculations, this doctor earns $2280 per hour for these first-time consultations.

Then we get into medicine. Insulin is a drug which cannot be made into a generic drug due to it [being of biological origin](http://www.dlife.com//diabetes/insulin/trecroci_122707). One vial of Humalog can cost around $300. My monthly prescription bill is around $300 with insurance. That's $3600 per year.

I know this pales in comparison to some people's medical bills, and I feel for them, but hopefully those people in more enlightened countries can see what we deal with here. Maybe some people here can become more enlightened too. If anything, personally I would just like the children to get free or cheap medicine.

Began running high fever one day in Sept. 2010 (104F), about 4-months after our daughter was born.  Ended up being diagnosed with Stage 2 Hodgkin's Lymphoma.  Began treatment, which was actually quite successful, but was hospitalized through most of it due to the fever persisting as well as extensive nerve damage after the very first dose of chemo.  At one point she was transferred to MD Anderson in Houston and they said: 1. They had no idea why she still had fever, and 2. They'd never seen someone with such extensive nerve damage after one dose of chemo (loss of function from the knee down on both legs, drop foot, etc.).

Once treatment was over, she continued to improve and was even walking using a walker/braces.  Fever still hung around but was mainly low grade.  Around November of 2011, she had a few days of high fever again (103.8F at the highest).  It subsided, then came back again in December (almost exactly 4-weeks later).  Subsided again (never actually ""normal"", just down to 101F which is normal for her these days).  

Around Feb 2012, the fever was back, along with some mental confusion (which was new).  Went to the hospital and was determined she had a very bad UTI.  She was treated for it and released, but was so physically weak at this point that she had to go to the rehabilitation hospital.  She went back to the regular hospital in Mid-March 2012 with another high fever.  Thorough investigation revealed no abnormalities anywhere, on anything.  No infection, nothing.  At the end of March the local hospital had exhausted all their options so she was transferred to the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota.

She is still at the Mayo Clinic and has been there for 3-weeks.  Her fever has hung around 103F the entire time, and her function has been declining.  She is asleep most of the time, and delusional/confused during the brief moments she is awake.  She has trouble using her hands now and cannot feed herself or even use her phone (both are new problems).  The Mayo Clinic has done many new tests, as well as repeated old tests:  lumbar puncture, CT scans, PET scan, multiple blood tests, bone marrow biopsy, MRI, EEG, EMG, and so on... and has hit a brick wall every time.  Every single test is negative and shows NOTHING.

They did a lymph node biopsy yesterday so we are waiting on the results, but if it shows nothing then they are getting ready to discharge her to come home with no answers, and just basically waste away.  I always thought that Mayo was where you went when nobody else could figure it out... they are one of the top places in the world for diagnosing people when nobody else can, and even THEY can't figure this out.

How can someone this young be THIS sick and nobody knows why?  I've had friends and family who have dealt with serious illness, but never in my life have I been told, ""We don't know why this is happening.""

Have any of you been in a similar situation?  Do you know of any options we should try next?  I feel like we have done everything we can do and yet she continues to get worse and we have no answers at all.

I feel like this is not a good thing to be doing, but it may be harmless for all I know.  I did myself used to be sort of addicted to sleeping aids. I do not take them anymore as I ended up being dependent on them to sleep.  Also on a side note my son told me her boyfriend puts benadryl in bread and doses the dog everynight as well. That seems weird to me. Thank you for your help.

Edit1- Thank you for all of your replies. I just woke up. I will read through all of them. 

Edit 2- I've gotten some really good advise from you all. I have never used /r/health before. Just to let you know, my relationship with my ex wife is as bad as it can be. She basically stole my son when he was a week old and I gave up everything to stay here and be a good dad.  That being said we do not talk on a personal level and any attempt of me to suggest a different way of raising him is percieved as threat to her. So I always have to pussy foot around things. You really have to be in one of these weird ex-relationships to understand, but you have to consider how you approach things very intelligently in order to maintain some kind of stability.
Having all of your input has greatly helped me approach this subject with some knowledge and reason. My son loves me dearly. I am a wonderful dad to him and fighting her to be that kind of dad has made me even better at being one.  He has agreed to refuse to take these pills, but I am afraid that she will punish him for doing something that I suggested.  She is just that kind of person. If it does escelate I will seek a legal remedy.

GF is home from the hospital, still lethargic and having intermittent angina and frequent coughing. They changed her medication to the following: Isosorbide Dinitrate (60 mg three times daily), Amlodipine (2.5 mg daily), Aspirin (81 mg daily), Effient (10 mg daily), Verapimil (80 mg three times daily), Pantaprazole (40 mg daily), Lipitor (20 mg daily-- should she even be taking this? Her cholesterol is perfect), sublingual Nitrostat (as needed), and Advair (500 mg, twice daily). Basically, they took her off Prednisone and Plavix, and put her on a new blood thinner, Effient. 


She has an appointment scheduled on Wednesday for a different cardiologist in San Francisco. I'm going to mention both Kounis Syndrome and Churg Strauss. I'm also going to ask that he test her blood for c-ANCA and p-ANCA, which might help in determining whether or not she has Churg Strauss. I'm going to ask about a higher dose of Prednisone (at least 60 mg). If we continue to experience problems with the new cardiologist, I'm going to call Kaiser and ask for a referral to a doctor at UCSF because of her unique (and potentially life-threatening) case. 


Thank you all so much to everyone that responded! Any input is helpful. I'm positive that someone, somewhere, will have the last piece to this diagnostic puzzle and she'll finally be on track towards recovery. I won't stop searching. I will definitely post updates as I get more information. Thank you, thank you, thank you. 


**UPDATE #2:**


My gf asked her cardiologist if she would be able to apply for a temporary handicapped placard for her car, so she doesn't have to walk too far (since she often gets out of breath). Today in the mail, we received a letter from her cardiologist stating what her health problems are, as well as a DMV application for the placard (a very kind gesture that I appreciate!). Here is his ""Patient Active Problem"" List:

* Degenerative Disc Disease, Lower Back *(But her primary care physician said arthritis? Are these the same things?)*
* Asthma
* Case/care mgmt, Asthma, Level 2
* Hx of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty
* GERD
* Angina, Prinzmetal
* MI, &lt; 8 weeks *(it's actually well beyond 8 weeks, but okay...)*
* Eosinophilia
* Leukocytosis
* **Acute coronary syndrome** *(first time I've heard of this!)*
* MI, acute, **non ST segment elevation**
* CAD *(I assume this stands for coronary artery disease... is this the same as atherosclerosis? We were told that she* didn't *have atherosclerosis)*

I'm not sure if this is helpful, but I thought I would include it anyway. 

**ORIGINAL POST:**


I’ll start from the beginning. About two years ago she was diagnosed with asthma. She started taking Monelukast (Singular) supplemented with Advair twice a day, and nebulized Albuterol as needed. About one year ago, she started to have, what she described at the time, as “heart burn.” Doctors told her she had gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD), and recommended she take OTC antiacids like Tums, Prilosec, etc., none of which helped much, despite avoiding acidic food. Months of persistent chest/stomach pain finally led to some lab tests. It was discovered that she had a *H. Pylori* bacteria infection and gastritis. She was given antibiotics, I think Cipro. 


Then, suddenly this March, she had a heart attack. We were sitting on the couch at our friend’s house watching Netflix, and she complained for hours about a foreign-body sensation in her throat. She started coughing a lot and having asthma problems. We decided to go to the hospital for her asthma; it was then that she passed out in the admitting area. She had an angiogram and angioplasty. She was diagnosed with the following: retroperitoneal hematoma, GERD, prinzmetal’s angina, and hx of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty [severe lesion proximal RCA—4.0 x 32 mm Taxus drug eluting stent expanded to 4.0 mm, spasm initially seen in LAD—not present at final angiogram, moderate inferobasilar wall motion abnormality with EF of approx 50%, angioseal deployed (6 Fr)]. She stayed in the hospital for a few days. She was put on the following medications: Asprin, Clopidogrel, Diltiazem, Famotidine, Simvastatin, and sublingual Nitroglycerin as needed. 


Since then, she has been hospitalized over twenty times with recurrent chest pain (luckily we have insurance), each time with elevated Troponin levels and eosinophilia. Nitroglycerin helps a bit, but not much (she usually has to take it 6-7 times a day). She has had her medicine changed back and forth each time. She’s been on several different forms of Isosorbide. Doctors say that her heart itself doesn’t seem to be a problem; the problem is that her coronary arteries are spasming and restricting oxygen to her heart. At one point it was suspected that she had vasculitis (Churg-Strauss Syndrome), but since she can’t have a biopsy (she's on blood thinners), they couldn’t make a conclusive diagnosis. They put her on Prednisone anyway, which seemed to help for awhile, then stopped working. She has seen multiple cardiologists, rheumatologists, and other specialists, none of which understand what’s going on. She has had five angiograms. On some of the angiograms you can’t even see her arteries, they’re so constricted. I have a couple pictures of her angiograms that I can scan tomorrow if it’s helpful.


We are running out of options and time. She has become lethargic, her quality of life has severely deteriorated, and it’s killing me to see her covered in brusies from being on Plavix, crying in her hospital bed because the pain is unbearable. I just want her to be the happy, healthy person she used to be… She’s in the hospital now once again and doctors are now thinking about retracting their initial diagnosis of prinzmetal’s angina because of her age. I’m lying in bed, home from work, feeling hopeless. I don't have any medical training, but I've been searching through a lot of medical journals the past few months, hoping to find something relevant or overlooked. I haven't yet. I really don’t know what to do anymore other than sit here and write this as I cry. 


Doctor’s of Reddit, what can we do? What do you think? We live in the SF Bay and have Kaiser Insurance. Is anyone interested in delving deeper into her case? 



**Other facts that might be useful:**

* 28 year old southeast Asian female
* History of smoking from age 17 to age 27 (quit before heart attack)
* Experiences angina every day, but angina increases during menstrual period. Also, her heart attack occurred while she was on her period. I asked if she could be put on the birth control pill to increase her estrogen levels, but her doctors said that would do more harm than good. 
* Stress test has always been normal. Angina occurs mostly at rest, but can also during activity. 
* Current medications: Verpamil, Simvastatin, Isosorbide Dinitrate, Prednisone 10 mg, Aspirin 325 mg, Nitrostat (as needed), Proair as needed) , Advair 500 mg, Plavix. 
* Discontinued medications: Metroprolol, Singulair, Amlodipine, Famotidine, Pantoprazole, Diltiazem, probably some others that I’m forgetting. 
* Persistent cough that doesn’t respond well to asthma medication
* No skin problems observed
* No Raynaud’s Phenomenon
* No Barrett’s esophagus
* Kidneys and liver normal
* Most recent (as of yesterday) eosinophil count: 25%
* Lipid panel is normal
* ALT, AST, alkaline phosphate is normal
* Erythrocyte sedimentation rate is normal


**TL;DR: MI in March with stent placed in RAC, GERD, eosinophilia, dyspnea, asthma, unstable angina caused by arterial vasospasms, 5 angiograms, normal stress test. Getting progressively worse and not responding to well to medication. Please help.**

I pump and oxygenate people's blood with the heart-lung machine while their heart is stopped during heart surgery (called cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB)).  I'm doing a rotation at a local teaching hospital, and they do something called isolated liver perfusion for patients suffering from hepatic cancer.  Just as the name implies, the liver is isolated from the rest of the body's circulation and hyperthermic chemotherapy drugs are circulated through it with what is essentially a smaller version of the CPB circuit.  The liver is bypassed with a separate CPB circuit.

Anyways, I got the hospital one morning a couple weeks excited to do my first surgery involving this.  The surgery began without any problems and the surgeons had begun to expose the liver (which is a lengthy process).  The phone in the OR rang, and the nurse, visibly angered by the conversation, hung up after a few minutes and told the surgeon that they had to stop. **The insurance company received the patient's payment two days late, and so they refused to pay for the treatment.**  Apparently someone working for this insurance company was doing some final checks that morning and found this error.  It had been missed before because how else could the patient have reached this point unless it was given the green light from the insurance company?  There was no proof that the patient had mailed the payment late; it could've gotten delayed at the post office for all they know.  As a result, they had to just close the patient back up and take them back to the ICU without treatment.

I've heard stories about insurance companies doing shitty things to people, but I've never witnessed something this awful.",,False,,t5_2qh9z,False,,,True,t3_onupd,http://www.reddit.com/r/Health/comments/onupd/i_recently_witnessed_the_evil_of_health_insurance/,

1320604012.0,172,self.Health,m2kag,"Reddit, about a week ago I posted about my gf who is sick for unknown reasons. After heeding your advice, I have an update. ",mistressnein,228,56,98,http://www.reddit.com/r/Health/comments/m2kag/reddit_about_a_week_ago_i_posted_about_my_gf_who/,"Last week I posted about how my gf was very sick and no doctor could figure out what was wrong. Reddit stepped in and suggested Kounis syndrome, Churg-Strauss, and Takayasu Arteritis. Folks on Reddit also suggested that I take my gf to a teaching hospital, such as UCSF or Stanford. 


Last Sunday, my gf started to have a lot of chest pain and needed to go to the ER. I took a risk and decided to take her to UCSF without preapproval from Kaiser. She had elevated troponin levels, so UCSF got Kaiser to pay for her treatment in the ER. Kaiser then requested that she be transferred to their hospital in San Francisco, but UCSF refused because they said my gf was not well enough for transport. Kaiser then agreed to pay for my gf’s stay at UCSF. Phew! 


The next day (she was admitted Sunday night), I mentioned the elusive Kounis syndrome to her cardiologist at UCSF. He was aware of it, but said that my gf’s medical history suggests that it wouldn’t be Kounis syndrome. He didn’t elaborate on what specifically led him to that conclusion, though. Vasculitis or ateritis were suspected. An order for a myocardial biopsy was put in (despite the obvious risks) to be done same day. The biopsy went well. After the biopsy was performed, Kaiser called UCSF saying that they would not pay for any treatment beyond the biopsy. My gf would either need to be transferred to Kaiser, or discharged. We opted to have her rest until the next morning (Tuesday), and then be discharged. 


Wednesday night we had to go back to the ER for chest pain. We went to Kaiser in Oakland, and had a unbelievably terrible experience (possibly even negligence on Kaiser’s part), which I can describe more fully if there is an interest. Long story short, gf had a minor NSTEMI (non ST elevated myocardial infarction/heart attack) and breathing difficulty/asthma/wheezing. She was given intravenous Diltiazem and Solu-cortef and nebulized Albuterol. She was stabilized and discharged several hours later, at 5 AM. 


Thursday night, again, back to ER (Kaiser Richmond—never, ever going to Kaiser Oakland again). This time for asthma only (no chest pain). She was given 60 mg of Prednisone and some kind of steroid in her nebulizer treatment. She had a number of blood tests done:

* **Neutrophils %:** 35  *(normal range according to Kaiser is 50 – 70)*
* **Lymphocytes %:** 16 *(“ 20 -50)*
* **Monos %:** 4 *(“ 1 – 11)*
* **Eosinophils %:** 45  *(“ 1 – 5)*
* **RBC’s, morphology:** Normal
* **Platelets:** Adequate
* **WBC Count:** 15.4 *(“ 3.5 – 12.5)*
* **Red blood cells count:** 4.70 *(“ 3.60 – 5.70)*
* **Hgb:** 12.5 *(“ 11.5 – 15.0)*
* **Hematocrit:** 36.8 *(“ 34.0 – 46.0)*
* **MCV:** 78 *(“ 80 – 100)*
* **RDW, RBC:** 13.2 *(“ 12.0 – 16.5)*
* **Platelets count:** 266 *(“ 140 – 400)*
* **Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate:** 42 *(“ 0 – 20)*
* **CRP (C-reactive protein):** 0.3 *(“ &lt; 0.5)*
* **Rheumatoid factor:** 60.1 *(“ &lt;14.0)*
* **C4 Complement:** 37.0 *(“ 10 – 40)*
* **C3 Complement:** 130 *(“ 83 – 180)*
* **ANA (Antinuclear Antibody):** Negative
* **IgE, QN:** 382 *(“ 0 – 130)*

She was not admitted in Richmond; discharged very early (2 am or so) Friday morning. Friday midmorning she had an appointment with her primary care physician in Richmond. Her PCP suggested going back to ER for her asthma, which she didn’t. That evening, her asthma worsened and I took her to Kaiser San Francisco at her request, hoping yet another new set of doctors might be able to shed some light on what’s going on. She was admitted, given Prednisone, Morphine, and Solumetrol. Prednisone seems to help with her chest pain now (she’s taking 60 mg), but it causes her to be extremely itchy all over all day and all night, so she’s just as miserable as before.


It’s now Sunday morning, and she’s being discharged because the myocardial biopsy had no abnormalities. 


We’re not sure what to do now. Reddit, do you have any other suggestions?

1331872048.0,120,self.Health,qyy3u,Irritable Bowel Syndrome is a really frustrating illness to have. No quick fixes - but I want to share how I got over it myself. ,,159,39,139,http://www.reddit.com/r/Health/comments/qyy3u/irritable_bowel_syndrome_is_a_really_frustrating/,"Hey, r/health. IBS is something the medical establishment doesn't really know how to deal with, most of the time. Isolating triggers is usually the way to go about it - but this mostly manages it and doesn't solve it. I have reduced my IBS, which is something I never thought I'd do. I used to have fatigue, chronic abdominal pain, bloating, terrible inability to control my bowels (mostly constipation), and I just felt really demoralised, because every time I ate I would feel shitty (literally - bad pun) and sluggish afterwards. 

So here's what I did. I'll give a little reason for each thing. 

ANXIETY - a lot of people think IBS is just anxiety, which can be a frustrating thing to hear. If anything, it can make existing anxiety worse! But managing anxiety is important, and the way I went about this was getting my life in order and through massive amounts of exercise. Trying to organise, stop unnecessary stress. Counselling and medication, if needs be. For supplements, magnesium (muscle relaxant) and St John's Wort have helped me heaps already. Also valerian is an indispensable herbal sleep remedy and has turned me from an insomniac into a relatively easy sleeper.

PHYSICAL HEALTH - yoga, chiropractic work, strength. I'm convinced that getting these things in order (I have been very unfit in the past) helped relax my body and prevent my nervous system from going into overload. I do believe there have been some studies down about the spine and how important central nervous system alignment is for the bowel. Lots of cardio, where you sweat considerably. It'll build up your endurance, too! To pain, discomfort, lots of things. 

DIET (this is a big one) - three major things:

1. Figuring out what I'm allergic to. I was already kind of suspicious about obvious things like gluten, but I did a biochemistry test and it turned out I couldn't eat all sorts of weird things. Eggs, capsicums, cabbage. Finding this out and eliminating these foods has helped me get rid of the really spiky abdominal pain, though I still had issues with soreness and bloating.

2. Paleo. I have been following a strict paleo diet and this has possibly been the biggest help to me. Why does it work? I believe, personally, processing modern foods for an already compromised digestive system is too hard. Stuff like grains and starches feed yeasts in the bowel that can compromise the good bacteria in it, and also they are simple carbohydrates that arguably humans weren't designed to eat in such large amounts. People may disagree, but the results for me have been argument enough. PALEO INVOVLES:

- eliminating: all grains (rice, wheat, spelt, buckwheat, quinoa, anything that is made into bread or pasta basically), starches (potatoes, tapioca etc - sweet potato is okay, however), legumes (soy [I still eat soy sauce however, because I only have it in small amounts and otherwise I would never, ever be able to eat Asian food], peanuts, beans, lentils), dairy (everything that contains high amounts of lactose, but yes, even yoghurt [however I permit SOME butter]), sugar (sweeteners, cane sugar [agave and honey are okay])

what does this leave? - meat, vegetables, fruits, nuts and seeds, honey, tea and coffee. alcohol is not advised, but it's okay. In the end, these are delicious, under-utilised foods! Finding paleo recipes has been fun and surprisingly satisfying, and what's great in the end, is that you're eating delicious things that are good for you! No guilt, just honest-to-goodness great food. I've recently found recipes for paleo biscuits, bread and fried chicken. Of course it's going to require personal organisation and makes eating out a bit of a headache, but it is satisfying (and it stops you from frittering away your money on shitty fast food!)

3. Food combining. It's difficult for the body to digest proteins and carbohydrates (like fruit) at the same time because the former process is very slow, the latter is very fast. Trying to avoid combining them helps. Also, somewhat weirdly, not drinking with food helps! Water can dilute stomach acids and make a weak digestive system even weaker.

PILLS - there are two, both very important:

1. Pro-biotic. I'm not entirely convinced that our heavy reliance on anti-biotics (and often not following the full course, or prescribing them too readily) hasn't caused severe problems in bacterial flora health in the gut. Basically these little bacteria are the things that break down your food for you. Without them, your digestion suffers. So pro-biotics try to restore them! Try to get a powerful pro-biotic pill with at least 4-5 strains of bacteria (yakult and the like is delicious, but not powerful enough!) YOU MUST TAKE ONE EVERY DAY, with meals. Also diet is very important. Paleo gives good conditions in the bowel, because the bacteria aren't competing with the sugary, starchy, yeasty conditions of a bowel on a regular diet. 

2. Digestive enzymes - I cannot get behind these enough! These are amazing. These gave my IBS the last kick in the teeth, and I feel confident enough to eat now without worrying about symptoms. These basically help you break down your food. They're easy to take. You simply take them with meals. Over a few days, you should notice a dramatic improvement in bloating. Even without the other things, give these a go!

ANTI-DEPRESSANTS - through a gastroenterologist I was prescribed a mild anti-depressant that has been shown to alleviate basic PTSD. This was designed to re-program my body and stop the stress response that occurred whenever I ate. Some decent research is behind this, but going off it I found more improvement with the other things. But it's something to think about. 

So, there you go. I did all these things together. Suddenly, I have energy again, can get out of bed in the morning, and don't feel horrible about the day ahead of me because I'm so anxious about my symptoms. As a six-year sufferer, this has been incredible. I know it's a big investment for a lot of people, but ultimately all of these things are agitating towards a healthier life overall, and even better one without pain. I still don't think a lot of gastroenterologists are looking at the body holistically, or linking the bowel to other body processes that might be going wrong. Did you know that your bowel has more nerve endings than anywhere else in your body? That's a lot that can go wrong. So it's important to have an open mind.

Also, don't be afraid to get these things checked out. I put off being tested and seeking medical help (though it didn't help much, it started me on a quest to find answers, which has been wonderful) for 6 years. And in the end, talking about it and getting a conoloscopy wasn't too bad. Also, if you have more serious conditions it allows you to know definitively. Also for instance, if you have coeliac disease! Eliminating gluten is a very easy way to eliminate symptoms in such a case. So actually, you can get better results. It's important to pursue symptoms if you have them.

To wrap up (this has been a very long post), all of this together has helped me. It's total, but I feel better than I ever have. And I have been so frustrated by conventional medicine's inability to help me that I had to do it myself. I'm sick of the misinformation, and want to see other people getting over this upsetting and difficult illness.

If you have any questions, I'm very happy to talk in a PM! (:

 
EDIT: also if anyone needs to me clarify exactly what you can and can't have on the paleo diet, feel free to ask. It can be quite confusing.

He ask for me and when I arrived, he told me so. And given his current state of health, I believe him.

A few months ago my mother was diagnosed with Breast Cancer. Luckily it was very minor and she caught it early and was able to take it out. Unfortuantly a couple weeks ago, we found out she has Lung Cancer (Carcinoid Cancer of the lung). She is awaiting more test results to know more.

I am pretty pissed about this, understandably so. And like I said in the title, I would like to go to war with cancer. The only way I know of to do this is to raise awareness and help raise money for cancer research (however, if you know of other ways, I am all ears). But I want to do something fun that other redditors may enjoy.

I did some looking and there is a Relay for Life next week in Burlingame California, which appears to be in the bay area.
http://relay.acsevents.org/site/TR/RelayForLife/RFLFY11CA?fr_id=34902&amp;pg=entry
I was thinking of starting up a reddit group and any redditors out there that want to go can go. Think of it as a reddit meetup for a cause. But really this all depends on the interest of all of you.

She also says that she is unable to follow TV or read a book because she doesn't understand what's happening. She couldn't explain that any better.

She was initially given a medication for a minor stroke (or TIA?) to get the blood flowing based on the initial CT scan (they suspected it might be her contraception pills). However another doctor's opinion was that she didn't have a blood clot in her brain after few days and then they did the EEG, which came out normal.

Now she is still feeling disconnected and having the memory problems and slight stuttering and slurring of speech. She also has some expressions on her face I have never seen before. The doctor's currently think it might be something psychological because she was somewhat depressed before the stuttering started. She is feeling fine otherwise and hasn't thrown up or anything and never lost her conciseness.

While we've been in the appeal process, we have gone through multiple rounds of antibiotics and my oldest has missed quite a bit of school due to her illness that isn't medically necessary to be treated.

So sure Anthem...  You can keep saying this is not medically necessary, but I know two little girls who have been constantly sick, lacking energy, and have yet to be determined long term side effects of always being sick -- All because you wish to stick to your callous, hard-hearted view of people and are unwilling to look at empirical evidence so that your stockholders can make just a bit more.

I may not be able to force you to pay for my children's necessary medication, but I can sure make life a bit hard for you by letting the world know sick children are just another of life's obstacles to your bottom line.  So, Anthem execs, the next time you go out to a nice fancy meal, buy another $8000 worth of wine for the table -- because that is how much money you saved per month by not helping me help my children.

Any advice is really helpful. thanks",terry947,118,17,123,http://www.reddit.com/r/Health/comments/spjxj/my_mom_is_a_super_hard_working_woman_and_it_sucks/,"Ok so I think I read every response. I'm really surprised at how nice r/health is. I've pieced together most of what you guys said plus some research that I've done on my own and ill put it here for people to read. I still have to do some research but hopefully this could help out other people who have the same problem. 


Rheumatoid arthritis is an auto-immune and inflammatory condition. As such, you may benefit from removing certain foods from your diet.

-Grains, especially wheat and anything that contains gluten
-Soy and other legumes including peanuts, conola oil, vegetable oil
-Dairy, maybe butter
-Vegetable oils
-Eggs
-Nightshades (peppers, eggplant, potato, and others)
-Red meat
-Sugars



Excess omega-6 intake and chronic omega-3 deficiency provoke inflammation (primary sources are grains and vegetable oils such as soy, corn, canola; these oils are ubiquitous in processed foods). You may also benefit from adding certain supplements to your diet, including vitamin D3, magnesium, digestive enzymes, and probiotics.


Eat lots of healthy animals and their fat, along with vegetables, and fruits and nuts on occasion.
Get plenty of sleep.
Get regular exercise – but not too much, and keep the Chronic Cardio to a minimum.
Get regular sun. (if you have inflamation you muscle supplement Vitamine D3 atleast 7-10,000 IU (trust me)
Don’t stress.

Some people suggest probiotic usage, either in supplement or whole food form (yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut)( to help gut flora*DO MORE RESEARCH)

Eating fibrous vegetables fresh from the garden, unwashed, in order to feed your new flora as well as introduce new bacteria and new digestive enzymes to diversify your gut’s digestive skill set. Foods like jicama, onions, garlic, and Jerusalem artichokes provide the prebiotic inulin (a type of fiber) which gut flora consume and convert to helpful short chain fatty acids. Olive oil, or coconut oil!!!!!!!! LOWER omega 6 oils, INCREASE FISH OIL!!!! Short chain omega 3 - flax oil. Its not as valuable. Not the same as fish oil. 



**Suggestions that people have made:**


-turmeric 3x daily, (450mg)

-I'd suggest reading the books Anti-Cancer, Real Food, and looking into the GAPS Diet

-Google 'gelatin arthritis', or 'chicken cartilage arthritis', or 'gelatin ray peat'

-Ditch all artificial supplements in use, replace them with brewers yeast

- Optional stuff: organic apple cider vinegar (in water, with honey if you like) and/or blackstrap molasses (bsm+milk=yummy), these are good for you. That should cover almost all vit/min needs.

-floatation therapy

-look at plaquenil

-reiki treatments?

-colloidal minerals

-Search for YYYY's post in this thread. Very good link and information too

-PALEO DIET!!!!!

-Black Cherry concentrate

I came out of the cubical and there was a random guy just standing there and ask me if I was ok as a lady sent him in to check, I walked out the bathroom and though the glass door I saw her staring at me. I went over to her and she went I know what your doing and whispered in my ear ""Your a male bulimic"". After what seemed like a long pause I looked at her and with watery eyes and dropped my head onto her shoulder and cried.

We went out into the beer sat on a bench out of the way I know everyone was looking and wondering but I blocked it and admitted everything.

I have yellow nail's, Red knuckles, gum bleeding, no energy, I have trouble remembering, I get violently cold.

My Parents where also at this gathering but as I stopped at my bosses house without them they didn't question it.

This is a throwaway account as I'm incredibly embarrassed by this. Basically, through a series of depression, lack of self worth, and laziness, I haven't brushed my teeth in two years. I'm starting to feel the effects. A few teeth hurt often now, and at first I thought it was my wisdom teeth coming in more, but I'm not so sure anymore. Also, on two of the teeth on the side of my mouth a little bit of the tooth...casing I guess? has chipped off. I know the harm I am doing myself and I have tried to brush them again but now I guess since it's been so long it hurts to brush them. What can I do to make it easier for me to transition back into healthy oral hygiene? I would love to go to a dentist but I honestly think I'm too embarrassed to do that right now, even though I know it would be the best thing. Maybe if I can get back to brushing and flossing regularly I will feel confident enough to seek out a dentist.",,False,,t5_2qh9z,False,,,True,t3_r6t6f,http://www.reddit.com/r/Health/comments/r6t6f/havent_brushed_my_teeth_in_two_years/,
