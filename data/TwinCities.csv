I came to visit my bf and stayed in NE Minneapolis for about a week but got to see all surrounding cities/areas, including St. Paul and even Rogers, where we went antiquing. It was my first visit to the U.S. and I'm glad I travelled through the midwest, definitely worth it.

Can't get over how much I loved the Twin Cities and Minnesota in general. Wish I could go to school here. Everybody was so nice and welcoming! Also, seems like there's great coffee everywhere I go. I don't think I could ever drink Tim Horton's the same way again. 

Some of my favourite places:

* Psycho Suzi's
* Modern Cafe
* Taraccino
* Elsie's, got turned down for bowling for not being 21 :-( but it seemed so awesome
* Minneapolis Institute of Arts -- amazing!! 
* Driving through downtown in general
* All the bridges, and the various views of the city/river from each bridge
* The skyline(s)
* Como zoo

In general, everything in your city seems very clean, pretty and classy. For some reason I expected something like Toronto before coming here and was pleasantly surprised. I love how it's not very crowded either.

Anyway this is probably a pointless post but just thought I'd drop by and say thanks to you Minnesotans for being awesome. Can't wait to come back during the summer! 9,998 lakes to go, lol.

I hadn't had a chance to make it out, but lately I've been looking at their pictures and I see a lot of shots that look a lot like someone trying to promote a regular club rather than what you may expect with a video-game themed place. Lots of scantily clad women, etc. Kinda turned me off, but today was the final straw.

Well, they are having a dance night there this weekend, called ""Beauties And the Geeks"", or something like that. And they are having a ""well dressed contest"". Except the prizes go to the ""nerdiest dressed guy"" and the ""hottest dressed girl"". I'm not an ultrafeminist crazy, but does this not rub anyone else the wrong way? I'm just really sick of these gender stereotypes and wish we could celebrate women being geeks, too, instead of everything being sexualized around them. Beyond that, it's sort of pathetic pandering and insulting to geeky guys, as if we need to be enticed with scantily clad girls to spend our money.

The worst part is, I called them out, twice on this on their facebook page and both times they deleted the post and reposted. I disliked their page and will not be visiting there in the future. 

I really, really wish there were places to hang out that cater to my interests that aren't saddled with all of the stupid/sexist aspects of club culture. Can't we celebrate music, video games, and drinking without the sexism?

Just wanted to make people aware of this. Obviously it's your choice whether you want to visit this place or not.

EDIT: Just want to point out, I'm not criticizing ""sexy"" or whatever. I'm criticizing the fact that they're implying it's OK for guys to be nerdy but girls should dress sexy.

I love arcades to death as much as the next redditor, and I admire that Rusty Quarters gave it a good shot, but all I'm saying is this: The owner has spoken at length about their current financial situation, both in the Indiegogo letter and on Facebook.  This is their 2nd donation drive in 12 months.  They are locked in a lease at their current location for another 18 months on rent they cannot afford.  No small business loans possible, no food/drink licenses possible.  

There is enough unpaid back rent that the mgmt company will only consider taking ownership of all the arcade machines to cover it other than $.  The owner has stated he thinks it's ""because the mgmt wants to run the arcade under different ownership"", instead of, oh idk, the landlord might like some tangible assets of some kind wherever they can get it.

It is obvious that the couple that own the store pour their heart and soul into the arcade, repair/maintenance of their hardware and their merchandise.  Many in the area who have championed the place as a rebirth of the modern local arcade.  All that aside, it does not take someone w/more than a month's work of HS economics to understand the writing is on the wall.  Heart and soul do not pay the bills, nor make up for poor business ownership skills.  (I could armchair-criticize how they run their arcade for days, but at this point it barely matters.)  

I'm pleading with anyone considering throwing extra money their way to keep the Rusty Quarters dream alive to rethink their decision.  There might be a market for a small arcade in the Twin Cities to flourish (I could rattle off a dozen places that have as much/better of a great arcade experience as RQ that have WAY more going on than just the stand-up machines,) but the space right next to Bryant-Lake Bowl isn't it.

Go to [this link](http://myballotmn.sos.state.mn.us/Default.aspx) to find out where your polling place is, and to see exactly what your ballot will look like.

2. **I'm not registered to vote, can I still vote?**

YES!  Use the link above to find your polling place, and show up there on election day (between 7am and 8pm) with the following items:

a. Photo ID (if your current address is on this ID, this is all you need)

b. If address on ID is different from current address, bring the ID and a document with **your name** and your **current address** (such as a utility bill, pay stub, etc) from the **past 30 days**; if you get online bills, just print one out, or bring your laptop/smartphone

3. **I just moved/I don't pay any utilities/none of the bills are in my name, what do I do?**

Bring someone else with you who lives in your precinct and is registered to vote.  They can vouch for you that you live where you say you do.  If they're not registered but they do have proof of their residency, have them register first, then vouch for you.

4. **I want to vote but I can't walk/drive to my polling place**

No problem!  You can sign up for a free ride to the polls, and someone will pick you up at whatever time you want.  There are several organizations who will do this.  One of them is Minnesotans United, and if you call **800-801-9286**, they will sign you up for a ride.

***

Now for the personal appeal:

Voting is a very important civic duty, and regardless of who/what you vote for, I hope that you and everyone you know will go out and exercise your civil rights.  That said, it would personally mean a lot to me if you vote NO on the marriage amendment and the voter ID amendment.  Here are some reasons why they matter to me:

**Voter ID**

1. The amendment is written very poorly.  It doesn't account for a lot of unintended consequences.

2. Unlike voter ID measures in almost every other state that has them, the writers of this amendment didn't make any exceptions for active military personnel or the very elderly who no longer have birth certificates.

3. No other state with voter ID laws has same-day voter registration. Election officials have said that the law, as currently written, would force same-day registration to end.

4. Unlike other states, the way the law is currently written would not allow students from non-state schools in Minnesota to use their student IDs.

5. The amendment, as currently written, is estimated to cost the state $30-50 million.  The state will have to pay for it by increasing property taxes.

6. Once it's in the constitution as currently written, it can't be changed, even if the legislature realizes that is has some unintended consequences; they will be forced to enact those laws because the constitution is the highest law; therefore, we should send it back to the legislature and make them rewrite it, and decide **beforehand** how they plan to enforce the law, so they don't force us to vote on something without first knowing all of the consequences.

**Marriage Amendment**

1. No one would want to be told it's illegal to marry the person they love

2. Gays and lesbians will always be in the minority; therefore, it's up to everyone, especially straight people, to stand up for and protect their rights

3. No single religion should be held above others and put into law, especially not the Constitution. Many religions, such as 3 of the 4 Jewish Movements (including mine), 5 of the 6 Minnesota Lutheran synods, many Baptists, Episcopalians, Anglicans, Quakers, Unitarians, and others, have same-sex marriage.  We shouldn't be discriminating against those religions.

4. The polls show that the vote is 50-50.  Whether the amendment is defeated will come down to how many people show up on election day. **You could be that 1 vote that makes the difference** (think of Al Franken's election)! How empowering is that???

***

Thank you all!  Please pass on all the information about how to vote to your friends.  This is a really important election and it's really important that you actually go out and vote!  I'm happy to answer any questions about how to vote if anyone is still not sure.

A lot of people are not happy with it and there are also a lot of people vehemently in favor of the changes. 

I can get behind how the TCS rules state that the subreddit “Is to be a pleasant subreddit and an appropriate level of decorum is expected. Comments not meeting this standard will be removed. Individuals repeatedly not meeting this standard will be removed.” I support that we should be aiming to maintain respectful posts–even when talking to those who we disagree with. Moderators should be expected to lead by example and to hold themselves accountable to their own expectations. Especially if part of the moderator’s goals are to repair the community which has been torn.


Yet just searching off of the most recent posts, without looking from anything posted more than a day ago (of which there is plenty more of the same):
“you are some sort of incompetent,” “mentally off their rocker,” “there are mods in charge who can tell the difference instead of plebeians like you” 

Name calling is not just using a harmless word. It deteriorates the attitude of the subreddit, is a sign of disrespect, and is meant to give someone a negative reaction. Mods sure can use whatever words they want, but as a leader in this subreddit, you shouldn’t choose to call names. According to the rules of TCS decorum where people who repeatedly makes issues are removed, I can think of at least one mod who is doing just this. Lowering moral, stirring up frustration and anger, he is not empathetic—instead he is caustic, he keeps ripping off scabs just as they begin to heal. Mkrfctr does not meet your own standards through his comments in the past several weeks. 


In a similar vein, mods should be held to the same submission rules as any other subscriber. It comes off hypocritical that a mod may post content which does not directly specify a time/place for people meeting up – whereas if anybody else had made that exact same post it would have been removed.

I don’t think that you understand that it isn’t the same 4 people complaining. A lot of people are unhappy with the changes that were made; moreover, unhappy with the way the mods are managing this change with utmost contempt to those who disagree. People are angry. It is not just that the subreddit was separated into two. That’s… whatever. But what is really hurting the community is a select group of people who are posting redirection in a hurtful, abusive manner. And then seeing mods who don’t follow their own rules that they just berated us for not obeying.

I woke up saturday morning in the passenger seat of a mini van in a parking lot, 6 blocks from my hotel, with a a cut on my forehead, and no memory of getting there or why i was there at all.  There was no one else in the van, or even the parking lot for that matter.

The parking lot was outside of St Mary's / Marys place, and a couple of other buildings.  It was near target field, across the bridge on 7th street (north west of target) and to the east of Royalston Ave, i think. 

The last thing i remember was being at sneaky petes with the crew i was with, and then waking up in the van.  We were drinking, but not hard enough for that.  The memory loss must have something to do with hitting my head, or maybe a roofie intended for a girl ended up in my drink.

Just wondering if you guys know any other places that are down in that parking lot, or if you can offer any insider knowledge on what the hell happened to me?  There was a shooting outside of sneaky petes and the cops came and dispersed people; my best guess at this point is that i got shoved in the commotion, clocked my head on something, and some good Samaritan brought me to the parking lot to stay out of trouble.  

Thanks in advance, was pretty concerned when i woke up to say the least.  Other than the bruise and the memory loss, i was in good shape.  No money stolen or organs harvested.

I live in Minneapolis and get internet service of 40 mbps down / 20 mbps up through Century Link. I had a 6 month promotion from when I signed up for the service. During the 6 month promotion I was paying approximately $40 per month for the internet service and modem lease. I do not use or need a home phone line or television subscription so I only had this internet service. 

The 6 month promotion period recently expired. When it did, my bill jumped to about $80 per month for the same service. 

I looked up the prices/promotions for new customers at Century Link and Comcast. New Century Link customers can still receive what looks like the same promotion I had when I started with Century Link. New Comcast customers can get 50 mbps service and a basic TV subscription for $50 per month (for 6 months).

I called Century Link customer service. From the list of automated options, I chose billing and then asked to talk to a customer service representative. I told the representative my bill recently doubled and I want to see what can be done about it or if I should look into other services. I told the representative I could get faster speeds for less money at Comcast -- the 50 mbps for $50. The representative said she could offer me lower speeds at lower prices, but that's all she could do, she would have to transfer me to another department if that wasn't satisfactory. I asked to be transferred to the other department.

When another representative picked up, I told him the same thing I told the first representative. He was able to offer me a rebate off my bill for the next 12 months. With the rebate, my bill will be about $48 per month for the same 40 mbps service. I went along with that.

Don't know if this will work for anyone else. But figured I'd offer up my experience in case it can help you avoid overpaying for internet.",,False,,t5_2r7ar,False,,,True,t3_1kaxuz,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwinCities/comments/1kaxuz/how_to_lower_your_internet_bill/,

What is Insert Coins?

When I first heard of a nightclub/old school arcade opening in downtown Minneapolis I was ecstatic. I was hopeful that the mix would make for a perfect weekend hangout spot for all my neck beard and club friends. But alas, it was not to be.

The location, directly across from the Fine Line, is prime but the exterior of the building is bland, not giving a hit whatsoever to what lies inside. When my friends and I entered we were told...let Me emphasize TOLD...that there was a strict No Hats policy and we would have to leave them in our car or coat check for $3 each. Fine. Whatever. 

Upon entering we were treated to a Group of 4 or 5 people standing behind, and around, the front desk area and were informed of the $10 cover. Fine Whatever.

The interior, from a nightclub/bar standpoint, is beautiful. The dance floor is pristine with a full stage for a DJ. The main bar on the lower level was very well put together and had multiple large televisions which were being used to play various xbox and ps3 game titles. The bartenders were all big breasted females with very little knowledge of actual bar tending. The drinks were overpriced for a place with a $10 cover and overall the crowd was thin considering it was a Friday night.

The only coin machine is located upstairs in the far back corner, there is more VIP seating than arcade games, there were not enough games to be considered an 'arcade' and not enough people on the dance floor to be considered a 'club'

NOW. The real problem with Insert coins...The staff. The staff. The staff. First off, there were just too many of them. Whether it be upstairs or down we would encounter groups of 3-4 staff members standing in a circle. No one knew where anything was or how anything worked. The bouncer outside told me to ""just throw your cigarette butt on the ground, the city picks them up for us."" The ones inside didn't know where coins were given out or where the ATM machine was (it was near the entrance)

What wacky idea would you rather spend the $500 million on?,a_humanoid,49,17,121,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwinCities/comments/1kcnzj/the_stadium_deal_might_be_dead_what_wacky_idea/,"With questions arising around the suspicious business activity of the Wilf's, progress on the new stadium has been put on hold.  Although it's unlikely the stadium deal will fall through, a team of lawyers have been hired to review Zygi's shady real estate business.  I don't know what they expect to find, but it wont be too surprising.  All I do know is that this project has the makings of a farce.  

So my fellow TC'ers, if you had complete public support and $500 million, what wacky idea would you spend the money on?  *Just a few rules.*


**The Rules**

* You must spend all money on one project.
* The money or project **cannot** be gifted to an existing institution.
* Majority of all dollars must be spent on construction.
* The project **cannot** be used as a platform for social change or commentary.
* The project has to promote ""jobs"" (I use that term loosely).
* The project almost certainly has to fail.


For example:  I think we should spend the money on building an exact replica of Jurassic Park on Harriet Island - with absolutely no dinosaurs, real or robotic.  Cardboard cut outs would be OK.  Only one programmer would build the park's entire computer system &amp; Sam Neil would give guided tours - in aviators of course.

Perhaps you've heard that in a coordinated and brutal assault, police in Oakland and New York raided and attempted to shut down the Occupy protest camps in those respective cities. Tens of thousands of people were assaulted, some with clubs, some with chemical weapons. **Tens of thousands of people.** Hundreds are in jail today.

What do you get on the front page of the PiPress? A story about carp, and a picture of some guys on a fucking boat.

This is shameful. Whatever you think of the Occupy protests, this is literally the only news anywhere today. It dominates the front page of newspapers across the world. In the Pioneer Press, it is on page 7.

We are principally a programming company, though it's a little more nuanced than that.

We're relaxed. Everybody is salary, some of us walk around in our socks, expletives are routinely exchanged. There's a grocery store nearby that we make a group run to practically every day.

Our office is in a ~~shitty old motel~~ unique space where we ship all of our weird personal purchases. It's not unusual to have a day where boxes with board games, motorcycle parts, and 3D printing filament land in the conference room. You'd be among Redditors, including myself, /u/norwegiangeek, and /u/twonuh. Our older four employees are past or present musicians and roadies. We have a great environment full of a variety of people, so if you're weird, you're perfect.

Speaking of which. Here's really what we're looking for.

* Familiar with computers. Like, you know how to use keyboard shortcuts, the clipboard, whatever. You're already on Reddit, so you're basically ready to go on this bullet point.
* Familiarity with simple Audio/Video concepts, like what an HDMI cable is, what its connectors looks like, and how an HDMI signal is different than a VGA signal. This is just an example, though. Background in A/V is a plus.
* Knowledge of computer programming is *not* necessary, and isn't even a strong plus. I know this seems counter-intuitive, but the programming we'll be doing is entirely different from any programming you learned in college. Unfortunately, a background in formal (ie ""good"") programming may hamper you while you learn all of the idiosyncratic ways of our universe.
* Your email subject line should include the phrase ""Reddit Job Post"" at the beginning. You seriously have to get this right or I'm not going to read your email. I'm putting this here to test you.
* Know how to research research research. Good note-keeping skills. Reasonable memory skills (or the organizational skills to make up for it). We work with lots of products that are all different, and occasionally different in insidious ways.

Does that seem too broad? Perhaps you're thinking, ""Golly, I dropped out of high school and even I meet that criteria."" Good.

So send me an email at [snip] if you think that this is you. I'm looking forward to hearing from you.

When I partially regained consciousness, my friend was trying to lead me out of the crowd to the back of the venue. At this point, I was still completely blind and my legs weren't working so well. As I tried to make my way through the crowd that I couldn't see, I remember feeling my hand land on what could have only been a woman's chest. I really wish I could have stopped to apologize, but I was in no state to do so...

So, if the woman in question happens to be reading this, please accept my deepest apologies. It was not intentional at all.

Additionally, thank you to the person near the front doors that handed me a bottle of water and refused the money I tried to offer for it.

I have the ""Find my Mac"" turned on so the moment they log onto wifi they're caught, but they haven't logged on yet. we're pulling surveillance footage from the gas stations so hopefully we can hunt them down. I'm constantly checking Craigslist and other outlets.

all of my music, demos, lyrics, rough ideas, video (50 GIGS from in studio footage) and everything else that is digital and important in my life is in that bag.. i'm offering a $1,200 reward for the fucker because I just want my stuff back. if it's you WAY TO GO you're gonna get paid.

I am tired of this city for many reasons, and want to move to Minneapolis.  Why?  Some of the reasons are below:

* I am a cold weather and snow person, and St. Louis doesn't deliver.  Also, it is way too hot in the summer.  
* I am a geek/nerd.  St. Louis really does not deliver in this area.  I've done Google searches for St. Louis and the twin cities for nerds/geeks, and I received a lot more hits from the twin cities search.  
* St. Louis sucks for singles.  For some reason, in my head, Minneapolis would be much better.
* St. Louis is far too conservative/traditional, which sucks being a black guy.  St. Louis is kinda racist, and I want to be with more progressive and more open minded people.  
* Minneapolis is a growing tech center, which is perfect for me.  I am a computer programmer, and would really like to grow my career, and to hang out with and make friends with like-minded people.  It is hard in St. Louis as it is not a technology hub, and there aren't really any places that cater to computer programmers, or to nerds/geeks in general.
* In a recent national survey, Minneapolis was ranked as having above average pizzas and burgers, and I LOVE beef.  
* In the same person, Minneapolis was ranked as having very smart peopld, and very attractive people.  I feel that meeting intellectually curious individuals would be much easier there than here.  

Basically, I don't believe St. Louis has anything to offer me.  Other cities that I believe are up my alley include Denver, Seattle, Boston, and the Bay Area.  I, however, believe that Minneapolis is the best fit for me for some of the reasons mentioned above.  

Again, I am a computer programmer.  I am not a senior level programmer, but more of a junior/mid at this point.  The main step in moving to Minneapolis is finding a job there.  For someone who specializes in .NET development, what companies should I apply to?",,False,,t5_2r7ar,False,,,True,t3_14orto,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwinCities/comments/14orto/want_to_move_to_minneapolis/,

I'm a clean/tidy person and prefer shared spaces to be kept relatively clean on a regular basis. Some of my hobbies/interests include cooking, reading, rock climbing, hiking, cycling, and PC gaming.

What do?",ctowns_down,25,3,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwinCities/comments/17d6wj/aussie_visiting_usa_got_two_weeks_beginning_in/,"Hello Minnesotians. I'm a 24 year old from Far Western Sydney and currently living on the south coast of New South Wales. When I was a young child my parents took me to California, Florida and Hawaii, I saw Disneyland, Seaworld, Disneyworld, Cape Canaveral, et cetera. Ever since I've had this notion that Americans had the biggest and best of everything.

Fast forward many years and now, for work, I'm visiting Minnesota at the start of June. While I'm over there my boss has given me two weeks off (paid :D) to explore. I'm not sure what to do with this time and hoping I can get some ideas without denting my childhood belief that Americans can do anything :)

At home downunder I spend my spare time in National Parks (mostly hiking, often camping) or at the brewery. I hear you guys have the best National Parks and awesome craft breweries. I'm pretty much stoked about this trip. I'm a scientist now but I used to be a truckie (truck driver) so my holidays are usually pretty packed, long drives are nothing to me. Although in inland Australia it is common to drive for hours counting kangaroos, emus and trees before reaching the next town. How difficult is renting a car or thumbing/hitchhiking in the states?

What would you guys recommend for a two week, one-way road trip? My boss is paying for a return flight to Sydney from LA or Dallas, I've accepted I'll be paying for a domestic flight probably to LA. I was thinking about exploring the South Dakota badlands and Yellowstone National Park plus whatever is between.

Cheers,

Chris

Nothing too crazy. The mall was packed-- moreso than it normally is, but it's the day after Christmas, and there are sales EVERYWHERE-- but still maneuverable with a stroller. 

It's 6:15 and we want to leave, so we cut through Nickelodeon Universe to head out on the East side(We ride Metro Transit everywhere), where there are cops ushering people a certain way, not letting them go through N. U. and even an unmarked K9 Unit German Shepherd. We leave out the exit, get down to the Transit Station, and the place is even more packed than the mall was, and our bus is still an hour's wait. There are cops down here, also, but that's sorta normal. {There have been thieves stealing cell phones on the Light Rail platforms and bus loading areas.}

While were sitting there, wondering why there are so many cops and people everywhere, we witness a man streaking through and flees into the bathroom, three cops hot on his trail. There's a loud bang, a cry of pain, and then he's lead away in cuffs, his shirt missing. Apparently they maced the hell out of him. 

We wait a little while longer, and our daughter starts to get fussy, but there's still a 30 minute wait, and our bus is usually very small. We decide to take a cab, and they park on the North side. We figure that we'll cut through the mall, so we head back that way.

Nope! 8 to 12 cops are guarding the entrance, turning people away, saying that the mall is closed. Looking at the holiday hours before we left, the mall was supposed to close at 9:30.

There haven't been any online postings anywhere about this yet, and we were wondering if anyone in the Twin Cities was there, and knows what's going on, because we're very curious.

As far as identifiers go, the passenger side headlight is broken (accident last week Thursday. Really.), passenger side window is busted out (how they stole the car), and the passenger side back door is missing the trim/molding thing that runs across it. There may or may not be a bike rack on the trunk, depending on what the fucks did with my car.
I just wanted to throw this out there because you never know. Plus, being a poor 20-something that works in the burbs, not having a car is really fucking up my life at the moment.

I've been looking over the last couple of months for a place of my own, and whenever I find a place that looks half-decent, all I seem to come across are volumes upon volumes of complaints about the landlords or management companies.

BBB has not been accurate, as many companies with A+ grades have several negative reviews from multiple tenants on other sites.

All have been along the lines of ""hey baby"" ""Hey girl, lemme get atcha"", and most recently today I was grabbed at twice and a man tried to take me on a date and put his number in my phone. The latter led to a construction worker from the light rail walking me all the way home to make sure I got there safely. 

These have all happened in broad daylight between 10am and mid afternoon, so time of day and location aren't an issue. 

I just want to know if this is something I'm going to have to get used to or should I pack my bags and head back where I came from?

I've pretty much had one of the worst days of my life, today.

Well first off, I came up here to see this girl I met online. I'd decided I'd start heading here after I got off of work, since it's about a 5 hour drive from where I live (west side of Iowa). I got here about 1 AM, but the internet girl (let's call her Ana) had been abducted by her friends for a night of partying. Okay, I thought. I did kinda spring this on her, and it is late, so I'll just see her in the morning. So I found a parking lot in a decent neighborhood and fell asleep.

When I woke up the next day, I called Ana asking if she wanted to get breakfast. Okay, she said. So I started heading over to her house, and all was well till I was at an intersection; I began crossing, and got SMACKED by this fucking van. My car's front passenger tire got fucked, radiator was leaking, could barely turn the wheel. It was a fucking mess. Neither of us were injured, though, but my car had to be towed away, so now I'm stuck 300 miles from home with no car. Police came, did their thing, and asked if I needed a ride. I said yes, since Ana has no car, and told them her address.

When I got there, I started telling her all about this day I've had, and she sympathizes with me, but then tells me that she can't stay because apparently her boss rescheduled her to work all this week. At that point, I just felt fucking defeated. Everything had gone so horribly wrong, and now I was alone in a huge city I was completely unfamiliar with, no place to go, and bound to walking everywhere (Her parents wouldn't allow guys to stay there).

So for the next 6 hours, I wandered the streets on foot, looking for a decent priced motel to stay at. I only have maybe 300 to my name at this point, so cheap was a necessity. After all that walking that scorched my skin and blistered my feet, I finally found a Days Inn to stay at.

And so that's where I'm at now: sitting in my motel room, feeling defeated and more alone than I've ever felt before, trying to figure out my next move. Any suggestions - or just some kind words - would be helpful. And sorry about any shitty writing - I'm writing this all on my phone.

What's the nightlife like in the part of town?
What is the range of ticket prices to Twins games?
Any camping, hiking areas within 50-60 miles?
How bike friendly are the twin cities for a weekend warrior cyclist?
How convenient is the public transport?
Are there many festivals (music, beer, art) put on over the summer?
Plus any other information you think might be interesting for someone in my situation.

Basically, we'll give women a chance to sit down with an attorney and see how to find any public criminal record they may have, what their rights are when it comes to housing and employment, what a record expungement can do, and how to get one (or put yourself in a good position to get one in a few years). Most of the women who come to this shelter are stuck in cycles of drug use, prostitution, abusive relationships, and homelessness, but almost all employers and landlords out there won't even look at someone with any criminal record, making it far more difficult for these women and their families to rejoin society. 

The shelter has been super helpful in getting this all set up and they've agreed to assume the cost of printing and office supplies for the day (we've been known to go through 1500+ sheets of paper in a day, so that's actually kind of a big deal), and I'd like to thank them for all their help. Currently, they need donations of any of the following:

* Cub Foods gift cards
* Bath towels
* Laundry detergent
* Hair products 
* Hand soap
* Toothbrushes
* Shampoo/conditioner
* Feminine hygiene items
* Diapers
* Panties
* Wash cloths

And that's my deal in a nutshell.  I always enjoy meeting new people and trying out cool new things.  Who wants to be friends?

I was wondering if any dudes out there could give me a recommendation on a new barber. I have gone to the same woman at Mens Dept. in downtown Minneapolis for almost the last three years. Right before my last appointment they called and said she had left to 'go back to school'. As it turns out, (according to Yelp and Google reviews) they had a change in ownership and lost all of their best stylists. 

Anyone out there have a recommendation for me? I live in the east metro and work in North Minneapolis, so I'd be willing to look anywhere from downtown Minneapolis to the east side of the cities. Thanks!


Also, if anyone knows any of the stylists that left Mens Dept, I'd be interested in scheduling with one of them!

I'm an Al's regular (yes, even from 800 miles away) and my other #1 breakfast joint, famous for pancakes and Polish sausage, is Bonnie's Cafe at Cretin/Vandalia and University.

Bonnie's is struggling because of the restricted traffic and general mess of the central corridor construction on University Avenue. This is a bummer, because Bonnie's is an institution of breakfasty goodness.  
(For those of you who've ever had a pint at the Dubliner, Bonnie's is the other half of the building.)

I just wanted to say: the next time you're looking for a new breakfast place, try this joint, because I will be so damn sad if I move back to the Cities and Bonnie's is GONE. That would be terrible!

I work in downtown St. Paul and have a major problem with eating out for lunch every goddamn day. But my fiscal loss is your gastronomic gain! In this sporadic series, I plan to document my culinary adventures, mostly focusing on cheap lunchtime eats in the streets and skyways of downtown St. Paul (because I'm in St. Paul, and I'm cheap).

If you enjoy this and want me to keep going with it, vote it up. I am not a food critic, I am just a food eater. Do not expect anything fancy out of me. That said, if there's somewhere you'd like me to go that's in my lunchtime range, let me know and I'll work on it. Without further ado...

**Today's restaurant: The American Burger Bar, 354 Wabasha St. N, St. Paul**

This is the third or fourth time I've been to the American Burger Bar, and they impress me more every time. I've only ever gotten the daily special, which is a rotating selection of burgers with fries for $8 with a glass of water. Told you, I'm cheap.

Today's special was the Cheyenne Burger, 1/3 pound of Angus beef topped with two thick-ass slabs of bacon, a couple homemade onion rings, and a light coating of barbeque sauce. Not enough to overload you on sweet, but just enough. Cajun fries on the side.

First impression: Well presented, as always. Very attractive plate. If there was one negative thing I noticed right off the bat, it was that the spices on the Cajun fries were very uneven. Some fries were overcoated, some were almost bare. If that's the worst gripe I've got, I'm happy. 4/5.

Taste: Fantastic. What a burger. The bacon was perfectly done. But my favorite part of going to the American Burger Bar: When I order a burger medium rare, that son of a bitch is perfectly medium rare. If you go anywhere else, you've got to order it rare to get it like this, if you can get it at all. The fries, as noted, were pretty uneven on the seasoning, but nicely done, not too soft, not to crisp. 4.5/5.

Service: The other couple times I've been there, the service has been friendly, helpful, and *slow,* especially given how quiet the place typically is during the day. Today was quite a bit better. I got served promptly, got my bill promptly. Didn't get asked if I wanted a refill on my water until I was done eating, which was less than ideal. I think they're pretty new in that building, and they seem to be getting the hang of it. 3.5/5.

Final judgement: Really, I like them more every time. If you're a burger snob, this is the place. 4/5!",,False,,t5_2r7ar,False,,,True,t3_pdibt,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwinCities/comments/pdibt/buffalo_pete_eats_first_of_a_sporadic_series/,

I have a beautiful older, male, neutered, de-clawed, long furred, soft grayish cat named Sydney. He is very laid back and likes to nap a lot. Seeks out attention when he would like some love but he is never pushy or annoying about it. Not a big meow-er, unless you are opening a can of wet food for him and then he is very encouraging. 

I have had this cat since he was a kitten; he is just the most amazing cat and is so important to my family! We are in a bad situation and cannot have him at the hotel with us. My brother was caring for him but is now moving to a place he can’t take Sydney. We literally have until the end of this week (28th of October) to find someone to watch him for us while we try to find an apartment. I hate to have to do this but I am afraid that if I can’t find a temporary home he will end up in a shelter that will put him down because he is old. This would be devastating. 

Please if you love cats, help me keep mine safe! He is such a good boy; he blends in like he belongs. He is just the right mix of independence and snuggle. And his fur is SOOO soft. He loves being brushed. He is a purr box, and will purr you to sleep if you want. For more information please message me.

I reversed out of the intersection and didn't wait around to see how long it would take for the arm to go up.

 Now that is bad, but what is even worse is that there is no Metro Transit phone line to report a problem after 5pm. You can leave a message which will probably be greeted with laughter upon hearing on Monday morning. I even tried the police non-emergency line which was also closed. Fuck these people, what the hell do I pay taxes for when I can't even get a hold of a real person after 5 o clock? The Metro Transit authority website had a number to call but is closed after 5pm and it suggests to call 911 if it is after business hours. I am sorry but I am not dealing with 911 for a stupid train arm fuck up. It is a waste of precious 911 resources for when there is an actual emergency.

This is not the first time Metro Transit has screwed up and it won't be the last. They need to at least have some staff running the phones after 5pm.

Once all the planning is done, the spouse who's in the know takes their significant other out for a nice, long date. That's when we move in with a crack team of contractors, and in the space of about four to five hours, completely renovate the room.  The renovation is worth tens of thousands of dollars.

As you can imagine, the big payoff is when the spouse brings their significant other home from the date. Their eyes will bug out when they see the newly refurbished room that they last saw only a few hours ago.

It's a great show, and we design and install amazing rooms. We make a lot of programming for HGTV and DIY already, but this is by far our coolest show yet.

So please, see the official casting call below for more details, including how to apply, and ask me anything you like! I swear this is for real. I love Reddit, and would really like to see a Redditor get a new room.  We're particularly interested in doing a library for someone.

Surprise Your Spouse with a Room Remodel!

* First dwelling in Minneapolis (Lake Calhoun)

* 45th parallel (Theo Wirth Pkwy @ Golden Valley Road)

* Victory Memorial Drive (on Theo Wirth just north of 394)

I have enough cards to teach and let you use one of my decks, but the game really does become more fun once you have your own cards and start building your own decks.

If you're unaware of what A:NR is, it's a card game (think Magic: The Gathering) only with two huge differences. One is that the two sides are not symmetrical. One side plays a hacker, and the other plays a mega-corporation and each side plays from a different pool of cards with different ways to win and completely different actions.

The second huge difference is that the cards aren't random in the box. Everyone has the same cards to build their decks from and each month a new set of 20 cards is available and you just buy that pack of 20 cards. No random boosters and no super rare cards.

Why? Because the Family court records office will only take by mail certified US funds and I do not live in the USA. I have no way of getting such a thing here.

They will accept cash if you go there in person. I'll send money to cover the certified copy ($14) plus if any postage is needed to send to me ($38 for international flat rate), plus I was thinking $20 for your time. Now I say postage may not be necessarily because a request through the mail is only $14 and they will ship to any where in the world without extra charge, so it would be easiest and cheapest if who ever went asked if this can be done.

I'll PM the record number I need, my address, and we can exchange paypal info for payment once I've made an agreement with someone.

I had circled a few bikes that fit what I wanted, and after the first few went over $150 easily, I gave it up.  Seriously, the only thing sold under $60 were shitty BMX's or children's bikes.   And the bikes weren't even that good. I feel like I see equal or greater quality bikes at garage sales all the time and those are always like $25 at the most.

As the title suggests, I'm in desperate need of advice in terms of where to look for housing.  My office is located in Bloomington, so I feel that just about anywhere in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area would be close enough to work.  My problem is that I have almost no idea what the different areas are like.  I'm only 25 years old, so I'm not really picky when it comes to school districts or nice yards.  I think I'm looking for areas with a younger crowd, where I can meet people and enjoy being social.  ""Hole in the wall"" type bars with good beer would be a plus, and I'm looking to spend about $500-700 a month.

It will take place on April 6th from 8pm to midnight.  This prom is intended to be a safe place for GLBTQA youth to have a prom they might otherwise not attend. We do have an age range limit from 17-20.  Persons over 21 years of age may attend as someones date if they pledge to be free of alcohol and drugs.

This is our second year holding this prom and last year was a great success.  We had only a few months to prepare and we ended p having 5 couples join us.  We do hope to have many more this year but we need help getting the word out!  There are pictures of the setup last year on our website.  This year we will have a photographer, food, dj and plenty of space to dance.  Our location this year is at St. Cloud State University in the Quarry.  The quarry is a great space with a capacity of 91 people.  I expect we won't have that many but if we do there is an alternative space available. :)

Some background: I am 26 and my boyfriend is 25 and we have no kids or pets. He grew up in California and I grew up in Massachusetts (met at college in Boston) but we moved to Sioux Falls last March because of the better economy/to try living somewhere different. I've really like Sioux Falls but there really aren't many people our age and the plane tickets back to either coast to see our families are very expensive. I also have some extended family in Minneapolis. So we decided to make the move to the Twin Cities area, having heard lots of great things about it and are ready for a new adventure.

We are moving in a month and neither of us have jobs yet, so the apartment search has been tricky as there's really nothing to go off. 

We are chiefly looking at Minneapolis but would not be opposed to living in St. Paul either. We are hoping to spend $600-$700/month (heat included). We also have a one-car garage in Sioux Falls so that would be nice but isn't a requirement. We have one car so one of us will most likely have to walk/bike/take public transit to work. 

We don't go out to bars often but do appreciate being near good restaurants. I've heard Uptown in Minneapolis is the place to be for all of that stuff. I'm hoping we can find an area that's sort of in-between ""happening"" and ""dead quiet"", haha.

We both *love* co-ops and ethnic food stores - Asian, Russian, European, anything really. This is the question I haven't seen answered - what are some good neighborhoods with ethnic food stores nearby? Do these neighborhoods have any co-ops and farmer's markets during the non-winter months? We also shop at chain grocery stores and Wal-mart for some things, but would really love to be near some non-traditional food stores, co-ops and farmer's markets.

Also, what is public transit like in St. Paul? I've read a lot about the light rail and bus systems in Minneapolis being pretty good. 

Thanks and I am very excited to move to your wonderful cities!

**Edit:** Thank-you all for the input! I will definitely be looking into a lot of those neighborhoods.

http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Pledge/395211553846836?fref=ts

Anyway, my friends and I love the idea of the 'going green' movement.  However, lately we've been feeling frustrated. It seems there's a lot of greenwashing going on and that jargon is turning people off to the movement.  The public is getting bombarded with a lot of 'green this' and 'green that'.  We feel the primary reasons for these problems is how businesses are communicating to the public.

See, the public, for better or worse, lumps the green/environmental movement under one umbrella.  Our project unifies to make it easier on the consumer.

Our goal is for businesses to create (if they don't already) or share their green initiatives on our platform.  Maybe they showcase their green certifications, or highlight simple goals like biking to work and reducing paper.  

When people want to know, ""what is my favorite pub doing to be more environmentally conscience"", or ""hey, my favorite pub is doing great things for the environment, they should publish that shit""...we think our platform will make it easy...

Anyway, it's late at night so my spelling might be horrible, but I'm passionate about this project.  Feedback and support would be nice.

Full time job with salary. ,,10,1,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwinCities/comments/g9rnq/looking_for_a_web_developerdesignerit_person_full/,"Hey fellow Twin Cities Redditors. I'll try and be as specific as possible. I'm no IT guru but I've been tasked with filling a job position and I thought I'd turn to Reddit first because you will be working directly with me and I need you to be awesome x a billionz. I want to work with someone who's savvy, intelligent and you don't make websites that look like a Geo Cities page.

A company in Long Lake, Minnesota is looking for an in-house person to manage the websites of four different companies (under one parent enterprise) and develop a social networking site for artists and athletes (it's already up and running but right now I would say it suck-diddly ucks Flanders). 

Like I said, I'm no IT guy but here's what you should be qualified with:


**MOST IMPORTANT EDIT OF ALL!!!!**: HTML, PHP (or Ruby), Web Design (mostly front end stuff, but if you have some back end experience that's great too!)

**EDIT:** Let me specify. The design/developer part is the most important thing. You don't have to be a rockstar when it comes to hosting (we can probably contract that to someone) but we would like you to know enough about it.

**Yet another BREAKING edit:**
Just talked with my boss. We definitely want to emphasize the design/programming part- if worse comes to worse we can host with someone else. 

**Breaking Edit 2** Salary is around 50K.

The most important thing: Making sites that function well, reek of Tiger Blood/Awesomeness and make people want to visit again!

Don't know anything about benefits yet. PM me for more details. 

Thanks!

My husband and I are moving to the Twin Cities soon, and we plan to buy a house. We're shopping in the under-60k range, and prefer older, single-family homes which are **not** in the suburbs. I'm going to Bethel for grad school and he'll probably be working downtown Minneapolis, so we don't want to go too far south of 94 or east of 35E. 

With those parameters, a lot of the results I'm seeing in preliminary online browsing are in locations like:

**Saint Paul**

* Payne-Phalen
* Thomas-Dale
* North End 
* Como
* Midway
* St. Anthony

**Minneapolis**

* Jordan
* Near North
* Holland

I've only been to the Twin Cities once (St. Anthony is the only neighborhood that I'm even a little familiar with) — and apparently it's illegal for realtors to tell you what a neighborhood is like. 

I've done a lot of Google street view browsing, used [City Data] (http://www.city-data.com), and read [stuff like this neighborhood list in Wikipedia] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighborhoods_of_Saint_Paul), but in many cases it's very unhelpful and just defines the geographical boundaries. So is there any wisdom you can offer? Thank you much!

This isn't really an annoyance, but I've been kicking around the concept of having a fully comprehensive guide for a while. The idea started as having a wiki-like map where users would shade neighborhoods with colors based on how friendly they are, but I have nowhere near the technical skills to build such a thing.

It would have to be standardized. People from various parts would make a list of pros and cons of a neighborhood (or city), as well as amenities and quirks. The architecture of this is still somewhat in the air. We could possibly use census tracts as a base-level unit, which could be easily integrated with actual data. 

One thing that would be a must would be absolute honesty. We can't gloss over bad parts of a neighborhood for the sake of making them look more attractive. There will be places we will flat up say ""Don't live here. You will get stabbed,"" or ""A lot of crackheads live here,"" or ""Don't live here unless you want stepford wives coming by every day to tell you how little Blake and Dakota are doing on their youth soccer teams and flute recitals.""

I'm fully aware this would be a somewhat massive undertaking, but it would be a good guide for people who want to know more about the cities than a realtor would disclose.

They improve handling, reduce braking distances, and make it far less frustrating to try to accelerate from a stop. 

Sure, you may be able to get by OK with all seasons, but winter tires are cheap insurance when you get into a situation where you need your car's maneuvering abilities to function in the snow. Sure, $500 is a chunk of money, but would you rather be spending that $500 on an insurance deductible to fix your car and the hours and hours digging it out of the ditch and the hassle of body shop stuff? Not to mention the potential of being injured in an accident.

So, next time you're sliding around in the snow and frustrated by the lack of traction, remember: you can fix this problem!

I'm looking to start up a table top role playing group, for either weekly or bi-weekly meetups. Experienced players and newbies alike totally welcome, I can accomodate anyone. 

I have a few games that are one-shot, single sitting deals, we could play to get introduced to gaming. I also have a few larger game campaigns we could play if the interest is there. 

PM or reply here with questions or if you have interest, thanks!

EDIT: Hey everyone! So I have gotten a lot of responses, and I thought I would update this post with some details.  

I have a Sci-Fi setting and campaign ready to go,  a horror (think cthulhu/xfiles/johndiesattheend) game nearly ready, and some big ideas for a fantasy game.

Since I have had such a good response, I would also be interested in running something like [this](http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/78/grand-experiments-west-marches/
), which would accomodate all players. Basically a large group of players all make characters who explore an untamed wilderness from a central town. The group changes every session, and actions one group takes change the world for the others. It could be fun!

The best way to get to know each other is also by having a meeting and playing a short social game, like [Dread] (http://dreadthegame.wordpress.com/about-dread-the-game/) or [Fiasco] (http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/games/fiasco/). Then after we know each other we can hammer out start dates and character creation.

EDIT DEUX: 

So after talking with everyone interested, it seems like weeknights work the best for everyone, withTuesday and Thursday seeming like the best candidates. 

I would like to meet everyone before we start a regular group, to make sure we are all on the same page, so I propose we meet either tomorrow (10/18) or next Thursday (10/25) and play a one-shot game of some sort. I've got 5-6 spots open for each night, so please let me know if either day works for you. We need at least 3 players each night for it to be fun.

Up until now, all my banking has been through a rather small bank in my hometown - adequate for checking, debit, and bill pay, but very inconvenient now that I live 4 hours away.

I just got out of college, and started a salaried job.  So, I'm paying off a little bit of college debt, but mostly have a good amount of cash coming in that I'm not using yet.  I'd like to buy a house in a few years, and I'm looking to buy a slightly used car within six months (my current is in pretty bad shape).  I could use a place where I could get financial advice - I know about interest rates, budgeting, etc, but I would like to put some of my money to work, and make sure I'm in a good position to minimize tax liabilities.

I've done a little googling, asked around a little.  A lot of my friends seem to use Bremer.  I found St Paul FCU, which seemed attractive in that they offer 2.99% interest on checking.  But, I really don't know how to compare banks.  Advice?

I also don't have a credit card.  I don't expect to start running up big bills too soon, but I would like to get one, so I can earn credits on some purchases, and not have to use a debit account for online transactions.  I know that's not necessarily tied to a bank decision, but if you have advice on that account, I'd be glad to hear it.",,False,,t5_2r7ar,1375677582.0,,,True,t3_1jn41p,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwinCities/comments/1jn41p/looking_for_a_bank_or_credit_union_in_the_twin/,

I'm not picky by any means but I do have a few basic criteria I'd like to satisfy:

* Inexpensive- *I want to play ~twice a month without breaking the bank*
* Maintained- *I don't need immaculate fairways but I do expect filled divots and clean traps*
* Relatively nearby- *Don't get my hopes up about a course just to tell me it's up in Duluth!* 
* Minimal elitist attitude- *I love golf, but I shoot just over 100 on a great day. If a muffed shot is enough to piss off the regulars, then I don't want to give that club my money.*

I'm guessing that a lot of people have some of the same things on their list too, so if there are enough suggestions I'd love to put together a spreadsheet that will let you quickly compare multiple courses at a time (e.g. price, course distance, on-site range, quality of play, etc).
