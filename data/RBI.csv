Thought i'd post this thread to give you guys updates and clear anything up for people who haven't seen my comments.

First of all here's all the pictures I've taken so far.
Original Pictures:

The damage caused to my Macbook charger that made me decide to look inside this thing:
http://imgur.com/geDsqRP

For the people wondering what inspired me to open up the extension / power strip in the first place, I had to wait for maintenance to reset the fuse to my room (took them about 2 hours) so I wanted to see the extent of the damage.

In regards to suspicions helicopter parents are still not ruled out, not sure if there'd be anyone wanting to spy on my parents.

Law enforcement is unlikely, I don't think I'm that interesting (a student) and it seems to be something you can purchase pretty readily online (not any special kit).

The simcard is currently in an old phone but no phone calls yet. I'll provide any updates on that front in here.

Any more suggestions are welcome, sim card forensics tools or even just suggestions about where else might be a good place to look incase there's any similar devices around.

Thanks for the comments everyone!

**UPDATE** 

I called and an automated message said ""the service is now closed and if you have voicemail you can turn it on and ......... "" nothing interesting - didnt get the last number called in

I created an account on the 02 website and the only information i got is that there have been no top-ups in the last three months

I called 02 and they said that they could not give me the incoming call log, would need a warrant but I don't want to get one ... is there another way to get the incoming call logs off the phone. 

Also how does the six months no outgoing call charges means deactivation of sim work?
As I left for uni at the beginning of October and its now May, but when I put the sim in a phone it worked. Is that possible as no-one could have made any outgoing calls. Or did it re-activate (if it had been inactive) on me putting it in the phone?

Begging whoever has it. (Fredericksburg)Someone took my phone. A Samsung Galaxy S3. It's white. It's only worth a few hundred bucks to you or anyone else. If you unlock the screen you will see my home screen. 

In the picture stands a man. A man with a backpack and 2 other bags. That man you see, was my husband. And that night, it was the last time he ever held me. If you open the gallery you will see a collection of photos. Mostly of him. But some of his children as well. You will also see some of his funeral. Of his burial flag, his coffin. 

See, that man you saw on the home screen. The one who looks so eager to head into a war zone to protect the country he loved and his family, he lost his life doing so. The only pictures I have of him are on that phone because my computer crashed after I transferred them. 

Tonight, I cried uncontrollably in the arms of a friend because tonight I felt as though I lost my husband once more. I know with time my memory will fade. I will have difficulty explaining his features to his children. Or why I think they look like him. One who never had the honor of meeting his father.

I don't care about the phone. If you have it. Please just email me. I will respond and you will be able to send them to my email and you will never hear from me again. I only want the pictures nothing else. The reward money is 100%. If you can prove to me you have the phone and are willing to give it back. Proof required: My husbands Eye color hair color and shirt color in the skype photo of him. Along with the type of cover that was on the phone.

Can you help?",Lstinala,177,19,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/RBI/comments/1bbu9t/grandfather_murdered_a_man_53_years_ago_were/,"My family has been trying to find the family of a man who was murdered back in 1959.  The murderer was my Grandfather.   In the summer of 1959, my grandfather was working as a carpenter.  At some point, he ran into a drifter and offered him room and board, with a little money on the side to help him with a job.  They worked all day, then my grandfather took him home with him.  After eating dinner, my grandfather went out, as he did every night to partake in the local moonshine.

Around 9 p.m., my grandfather came stumbling in, drunk and agitated.  He found the man sitting in the front room, reading the paper with my great grandmother.  An argument ensued, ending with my grandfather shooting the man, point blank with a shot gun, killing him.

The man had introduced himself as Chester Stotts.  But, police found numerous forms of ID on him (back then it was social security cards, membership cards, a paper driverâs license).  He did have a social security card with the name Chester Otis Stotts.  He had spoken of a wife and two daughters.  And, it also believed that he came from Kentucky, Indiana or Missouri.  Law Enforcement were not able to find anything viable, so the man was buried in a unmarked grave in our community cemetery.   My father would later place a tombstone on the grave with the only name we knew âChester Otis Stottsâ.  In addition, he and my mother would make regular trips to Missouri, Kentucky or Indiana in hopes of tracking down his family (this is before the internet age). They did this up until their deaths 4 years ago.  

Now, Iâm posting here, hoping that somebody may know of a family named âStottsâ, that had a male member go missing in 1959.  I know this took place a long time ago, and itâs possible this manâs immediate family has passed, but it would be nice to get some closure.

And for the record, my grandfather was convicted and serve significant prison time for this murder.  Like my father, I canât undo the horrible crime, but I can continue his search for the family.

Edit:  Picture added of the tombstone placed on the grave.  http://imgur.com/VWB2eGm

1366845942.0,131,self.RBI,1d1mjp,Looking for 3 Girls I Saved From House Fire When I was 17,Kofcandre,160,29,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/RBI/comments/1d1mjp/looking_for_3_girls_i_saved_from_house_fire_when/,"It was either 1993 or 1994 I am not sure about the date, there was a family who lived next door to my parents house they had 3 daughters I know one daughter was about 1-2 years younger than me. 
I believe her name was Dusty or Destiny I think she was a step daughter, the fathers name was Marty I don't remember the mother's name. 
I know Dusty or Destiny attended Antelope Valley High School for a while. 
The other 2 girls were about 4 years old and 6 years old if I remember correctly. Marty worked in Aerospace in Palmdale CA. 

Here is what I remember about that evening:
I was in my parent's back yard working out, and I heard a fire alarm go off next door, I looked over the fence and saw fire coming from the window. I ran inside my parents house and told my mom to call 911, I grabbed a couple fire extingushers from my parents kitchen and ran over next door.

The front door was unlocked to I ran in and went down the hall and the older sister was crouched down in the corner of the hallway, I asked her where her sisters were she was crying and in panic. I pulled her out of the hallway and told her to go across the street to the neighbors and make sure the fire dept was on the way. 
I entered the little girls room fire was coming from under the bed up the wall and over the ceiling. 
I looked around the room but it was so smokey and dark and the only bright light was from the flames, I was able to see the two little girls in the corner crying. 
I reached over and picked them up, I remember one of them was scratching me and hitting me as they were frightened. I ran out of the house and handed them to neighbors who were gathered outside. 
I then went back into the house and started swipping the fire with the first extingusher until it ran out, then I started using the second one and was able to knock the flames down enough to break out the window and toss the smoldering bed outside. 
I jumped out of the window mostly because I needed air, then I noticed a water hose nearby and used the water hose to put out the mattress and box spring. 
By this time the fire department started to pull up and started treatment on the girls, I refused treatment but found out later that all the hair on my arms, legs, stubble on my face, neck and some of hair on my head were burned off. 

A few days later I found out that the 2 little girls were playing with a candle under their bed. 
Marty was upset that I broke out the window that he wanted my dad to pay for the replacement, or so I was told by another neighbor not sure if that was true or not. 
Shortly after the fire they moved away. I would just like to know how the girls ended up in life and if they remember that evening at all. I am sure the older sister does. About a year after the fire I moved away from home.

She was 26, and besides a few pictures on her profile, there wasn't much other info. She also did not use her real name on the website. After a few messages, we exchanged phone numbers and started texting.


Things were going okay until we started talking about sexual preferences, when she asked me if I was into incest, then if I was into underage, and lastly, and to quote her ""U want ta fuck my daughter?"".


When I responded negatively to the above, she responded with ""I WANT COCK FOR MY LISA!"". I told her I couldn't help her there, and tried to back away from the subject, not being sure if she was serious or not. However, she kept bringing it up: asked me to tell her incest stories; suggesting I should try underage; asking me what sorts of things I would do to her daughter. In the process she also told me that her daughter is 10 years old.


I declined to answer any of those, and eventually stopped texting her altogether. This all happened over a period of 2-3 days, and haven't talked to her since. The extent of our interaction was solely on that dating site and through texting.


I tried not to think about it much at the time. I thought that maybe I should do something about it, like report her to the police, but I didn't know her name or exact location (I live in a large metropolitan area and online people often claim to be from the city, when they actually live in a surrounding town or county). I only had her phone number, which has an out of state area code. I didn't know if I was being trolled, or if it was just a fake profile setup by some creep. I also wouldn't want to give my phone to the police for evidence or whatever because there are pictures/etc of drugs/paraphernalia on there (trees and such) which might get me in trouble. I had also admitted in my texts to her that I do certain drugs and whatnot. Anyway, going to the police didn't seem like a good idea at the time, so I just tried to forget the whole experience.


But now its starting to eat at my conscience and feel like I should do something it; what if there really is a 10 year old girl out there whose being abused by her mother in this manner?


What should I do? The only concrete personal information that I have about her is her phone number (which I will not post on here). I also have the entirety of our text conversation still on my phone. I think that she probably really does live in my area and I'm pretty sure that she really is 26, and I also have a few other vague bits of personal information (like I know the month of her birthday). I'm not entirely sure whether she really does have a daughter.


I thought about simply sending an anonymous email to my local police department with the information that I have, but I don't know if it's enough for them to take it seriously or to be able to do anything about it.


TL;DR A woman I met online wanted me to abuse her daughter, and I'm not sure if it was legit or if I have enough information to report it to law enforcement.


What should I do reddit? Do you think this could even be real?


**UPDATE**: 
I contacted the central police department in my area electronically and explained my situation to them. I'm awaiting their reply so I can send them the information I have. Thanks for all the responses everyone.  

And no, I haven't contacted a lawyer, I'm 20, still in school, no steady income, no chance of being able to afford one.

ok, so here is the Saga of this particular Purple Heart:

i have a friend who was unpacking a case of water into her cabinet when the PH in question fell out of the package.  she really had no idea how such a thing could get in a package of bottled water, so she sent me a couple of pictures of the medal and asked me if i thought i could find the owner, because i research stuff like that for a living.  that is when i made the picture in the Original Post.  

i posted the picture to the facebooks before i posted it here, and updated that FB post with information i was finding from the reddit thread posted above.  a few dozen shares later, and we were making some real progress.

turns out that my friend who found the medal in her water bottles had given a ride a month earlier to one of Moses' sister's grandchildren.  This person carried the Purple Heart for good luck.  He accidentally dropped the medal while he was in the back seat with the package of water.  my friend didn't use the water for a couple of weeks, but when she went to unpack the water, the medal fell out.  

a few dozen facebook shares later and she was able to get in contact with her friend to give him back his medal!

The men seen by neighbors were obvious drug addicts known for stealing and selling food stamps. As men they were not supposed to be in the building, yet somehow they were.

After beating her to death while her 2 kids slept in the next room they took most of her belongings and children's toys and spent the night selling the items door to door in the shelter (most of these items were recovered by police). A neighbor stated she had seen these 3-4 men harassing her for her food stamps outside of the shelter earlier in the week. 

Police did a slap shot job in the investigation bc she was a homeless woman in a shelter. The scene was contaminated by unloved investigators and no reliable fingerprints were ever lifted. After beating her to death they stuffed her mouth with narcotics in an attempt to make her death seem drug related. Her tox screen was clean at autopsy.

Security footage only showed men in dark hoodies repeatedly entering/leaving her apartment to sell her belongings while her body laid in the apartment living room in full view of the hall and anyone who may pass.

W/O a doubt these were drug addicts. I'm hoping at some point they bragged about their crime to someone, somewhere at sometime. The only ID'ing info is one man either Hispanic or light skinned black had longer curly hair (2008). My friend Ilisha was about 5'6-5'7, app 140lbs curly reddish hair with black roots (Puerto Rican), a tattoo of her name on her upper arm, large gap in front top teeth and very large chested. Her chest was how ppl knew her lol. 

Any info or even similar cases in the Queens burough is greatly appreciated. 

**EDIT** Thank you all for your advice and kind words. I realize how long ago this was, but I also know there are cases from the 50's getting solved today. 

I think it's important to know (NY'ers might recall this) that around 2002-2003 the Social Services Offices in NYC got into a lot of trouble for having women and families sleeping IN the offices; under desks and on benches. Ilisha was the woman who broke this to several local news affiliates after sleeping in a bathroom with her kids. Arnold Diaz's ""Shame On You"" responded to her plea first and the city was forced to step up and put these ppl in cheap roach motels. Ilisha was told by her case manager that the City was unhappy with her (she did an interview about her experience) and any further ""trouble"" and they would find a reason to delay/reject her benefits. I can't help but feel this played into the slap shot investigation. What I mean is, I know that the news simply cannot report on every homicide in NYC everyday but a single mom, beaten to death by men who sauntered past security in a ""strict"" Woman/Children's Shelter, who's items were sold door to door (on video!) yet no one who purchased these items could recall a single detail of what the men looked like would peak SOME reporters interest. 

I even contacted Arnold Diaz, thinking since she helped get him a fairly big story that all the major affiliates ended up covering he may be willing to help. Nothing. As soon as the investigation opened, it closed. Typically with so much footage the police ASK news affiliates to show it so they can get leads. When I brought this up the detective responded ""Well this isn't your fucking job, is it?"" I want to note, at the time I was 100% confident and cooperative with the police. They weren't interested that I spoke to her on the phone about an hour b4 her time of death. They also weren't interested in the fact that her son had gotten up to use the bathroom and witnessed the men arguing with his mother. They didn't even ask him for a description! They never spoke to the security guard at the front desk who buzzed them in. They did next to nothing.

The neighbor who discovered her kids eating cereal next to her body in the morning and called the police told me how the first officers to arrive touched everything w/o gloves and even rolled her body before a detective or coroner was at the scene. Some of the pills fell out of her mouth and an officer said ""Shit."" and stuffed them back in. I don't want anyone to think I don't trust law enforcement just bc her case is unsolved, there are damn good reasons. 

Now this last part is the most outrageous and suspicious. When her Aunt got the death certificate it was marked ""Suicide"" but the ""Method"" area was left blank. We got the autopsy report and waited 6 hours to speak to the man who conducted the autopsy. We asked how she committed suicide? How did she break her own jaw, both eye sockets, knock out half of her own teeth, crack her own skull in 2 places, cause internal bleeding from several major organs, rip a chunk outta her own scalp then stuff pills in her mouth but not swallow them? He took the certificate and report and had security escort us out (we were not being belligerent, threatening, etc). A week later a new death certificate was issued with cause of death listed as ""Homicide"". We had been clear that were going to send his report to another coroner for a second opinion if he didn't answer our questions, instead he simply reissued. I think he was pressured to close this case for the police.

How do I know these men were addicts? Several neighbors willing to talk to me away from the shelter explained that for months residents had been complaining about these men smoking crack and leaving crack pipes in the shelters courtyard where the children played (its enclosed by the building and you need to pass thru the building to reach the courtyard). They had also been in several scrapes with ppl over food stamps and drugs. Now Ilisha had been fighting for extra food stamps from the City and one of the neighbors who spoke to me told me one of the men involved had overheard her telling a friend in front of the shelter that she had finally been approved and they were even giving her extra food stamps going back to when she first filed for the increase. This man approached her and started asking if he could buy some of her food stamps and when she said no he became belligerent and a passerby had to restrain him while she got her kids inside. This was not the first time one of these men had had altercations with shelter residents over buying/selling benefits. Therefore I'm confident these were crack addicts (the neighbor referred to them as ""crackheads"").

I never came across anyone in the building who was questioned by police except the woman who found her body. Not one. The detective never denied not interviewing anyone and often wouldn't even return calls. My best friend of 15yrs was nothing but another homeless woman to them. When the City wanted to put her in a cardboard box and drop her in a paupers grave I came up with the $$$ for a proper casket, service and plot. As a young single mom myself that was financially very difficult, but she was my sister and closer then blood so she deserved what little I could do. Even members of her family in law enforcement could not find out why her case was handled the way it was. I have no delusions about solving this thru Reddit, but I have hope that if I throw out enough hooks ill get something eventually. At some point one or all of these men have probably been to jail/prison. Even if an ex-con recalls hearing a similar story I'm willing to listen. Heard some druggie on the corner talking? Ill listen. You get away with such a horrific and blatant crime, chances are good that at some point you're gonna open your mouth.

A while back this appeared outside our house.

They took it down after a couple weeks and we never figured out what it was.

This post is only to see if I could get the help that I seek.

A few months back I was attacked by 5 teens from 14-17 years old.  The reason I was attacked was for asking them to put out a fire without getting them in trouble for drinking.  [pics of my recover](http://imgur.com/a/d1SAz)

I was beaten so badly and left for dead.  The only reason I am alive today is due to kind people that helped me out of the woods.

They all had records before this for drinking and fighting.  They are all drinking again and posting pictures to facebook of themselves drinking/smoking in woods again.  I have contact the DA about them doing this again yet they still seem to walk without even losing a step.  With in one of the papers recieved the judge at the pretrail thing said they were not to use facebook and have no contact with each other, they all used facebook and contacted each other.  One got sent to a joke of a rehabilitation facility, and will be reviewed in a few weeks.  

Only one got raised up to an adult which is the only one that is getting a decent sentence, because he evaded the law for 20 days.  The current DA that is working on that one is good and has stated that based on the criteria to define my case it is at the top of the scale that they use.

I have a civil lawyer, but I don't know how much help that will be since they are all kids.  All the information that I have gotten about them has been open source info.

I am just wondering what if anything I can do to make these peoples lifes just a little more crappy since it seems that they got such a light sentence.  So far everyone pleaded guilty, which they were.  There was 10-12 people with them so the case does not hinge on what I say happened.    


EDIT1: going to sleep now.  Will be up in a few hours if not sooner (noises freak me out now).

This happened around the time of all the news reports of travon martin so I was afraid to fight back.


EDIT2: [link to a news story about this](http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/delco/Man-beaten-by-5-kids-drinking-in-woods.html) there is other ones as well as tv news reports.

EDIT3: ideas list (no particular order)

* hire a PI to follow them around.  3 are out and the costs might be unfeesable.

* hire some juveniles to kick there asses (they would deffently rat me out and the cycle would continue)

* contact the prosecutor about this again.  (I have, the prosecutor also hinted that what I was doing could be consider ""stalking"" even if it was online only and I made no contact with them at all)

* contact the police again. (I have)

* contact the PO's.  (don't have anyway to know who they are)

*  call 911 with a burner in the woods where they go.  (good idea in theory but I can't go in the woods anymore)
*  message me if you want me to add your idea specifically

EDIT4:  Is there a way to bring criminal actions against the parents as well?

EDIT5: this pdf outlines some very wrong things that occurred within this process [link](http://www.jlc.org/files/publications/Youth%20Expungement%20FINAL.pdf)

EDIT6 (off topic): why when I refresh often do see down votes that have a +/- 5 votes @80 up votes.  It seems that there is bots that are running that create a +/- of **30 - total votes/10** votes based on the total number of up votes in a given thread.  This is a variance of 12 hours ago when the thread had ~50 up votes and had constant variance of +/- 3 up votes.  Yet I don't think that there would be that much up/down voting that quick in this sub.

Casio projector broke within the first 90 days ... Covered by warrantee, no sweat. Called up Casio repairs (800 706 2534 #2), and they told me:

Send to: 

Casio Repairs 570 Mount Pleasant Ave Dover, NJ 07801

Include: reciept, a note explaining the problem, my name, my return address, my phone number sent in a ""trackable way""

I followed the instructions to a ""T"", and on top of tracking it, I insured it for the full amount of the device.
I was told it would take 6-8 weeks to fix. Around week 4, I started getting antsy, so I called to see what was the status. Apparently:

Casio fixed the projector, sent it back to me in the actual projector box (without telling me via phone or email), didn't insure it, and explicitly didn't require a signature. They sent it back to me during the holiday season. I do not have this in my possession. Obviously, SOMEONE stole it. I don't care about WHO stole it, I believe that Fed Ex or Casio is to blame. I should have had to sign for it, and/or I should have been notified that it was coming back. I would have worked from home had I known I was getting my baby (try playing Guitar Hero on a 1080p projector) back and it was going to be no sign. required. Why would Casio send me a $1,000 item back during the holiday season and NOT require a signature? Moronic.


I put in a claim to Casio (who put in a claim to Fed Ex), and it basically turned into a 3 week round-robin finger-pointing circus between Fed Ex and Casio. Now they say that neither of them are to blame. Fed Ex is saying since a signature wasn't required that it wasn't their fault. I can buy that. Casio is saying that it's not their fault, and nothing further. No explanations. Fed Ex has refused to talk to us (me and my SO) the whole time saying that they will only deal with Casio.

This is bullshit. My SO and I want some justice. I would like my projector back, but I'll settle for a same-model replacement.

Reddit: Please tell me what to do to get some justice. I can't let this one slip through the cracks. Are there magical words I can speak to Casio to get my projector replaced (they still sell it)? Should I take them to small claims court? Do I take this up with Fed Ex even though they have refused to talk to us about the matter?

TL;DR sent in broken projector (in the warrantee period) to Casio, they send back, no sig. required, stolen from me (never took possession), now neither Fed Ex or Casio are doing anything about it. What do I do?

**edit: I initially posted this to /r/justiceporn, but they told me to come here**

**update #1 2013-02-25 16:21** - called up casio and calmly explained what was wrong with all that.  Said if no resolution is met, I will be forced to go to small claims court and name the manager in my suit.  Apparently these were the magical words to speak;  I was told I'd get a call back today or tomorrow.  We shall see...  To all those suggesting small claims court: I looked into it, and I'm ready to move forward with this pending I don't get a phone call by the time said by the manager in the time range she suggested.  Lucky for me, my nearest small claims court is walking distance from my job!  The manager I spoke to said that this has caused them to change their shipping policies to requiring a signature.

**update #2 2013-02-26 16:19**  Casio got back to me.  They are going to replace the projector with a new one, and they have changed their shipping policies (or so they told me) so that this doesn't happen again.

I have just found out she took it out of state and had been planning the whole time to never return. She won't answer my calls so I am going to the police and then I suppose I will attempt unorthodox vigilantism, including possibly hiring a PI and offering a reward for its return. Everything I did was wrong, but this doesn't change the fact that the laptop has important files on it, and she borrowed it under false pretenses. I would pretty much do whatever it takes to get it back. I believe I have located the complex she is in but with only the number I am unable to narrow down which apartment it is. I don't know what to do but I want to recover it.

The reason I am asking if I have any legal paths available to me is because my friend's brother's girlfriend took his laptop out of state once, and the police hassled her until she returned it. He had also let her ""borrow"" it. If I have no legal recourse, would hiring a PI help?

Oh, and before she left, she put all my things into storage, and I have no idea how to get to that either. She lives about two hours away. I would really like my stuff back. Yes, she is mother of the year. If you're wondering why she didn't tell me she was leaving or where she was going, it's because she is now living with her ex who abused me and others in my family as a child. She's a real winner.

What do I do (x-post from /r/AskReddit),imbeingstalkedhelp,119,25,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/RBI/comments/1g8d1z/im_being_stalked_what_do_i_do_xpost_from/,"I'm an immigrant to the U.S. and I met my future-husband in 2006 and we got hitched in 2010. After we got married, I received a conditional green card (must stay married for 5 years or revoked). Fast forward to early 2012, things were not going so well between us so we mutually agreed to separate (not divorce) for the time being. We both needed time to decide what the future of ""us"" would be. My husband used his separation time to get a girlfriend, so in turn, I got a boyfriend.

I joined a dating site in early 2013, met a guy (we'll call him Al), hooked up a few times, and then due to my unresolved past, he decided to end things with me.
Fast forward to April. Al randomly texts me professing his love and desire to be with me forever. At this point, I had already moved on from my fling and was not interested in his advances. One morning, when I walked outside of my apartment, I noticed my car tires were slashed, and my license plate stolen. Ironically enough, I get a call the very same morning from Al inquiring how I'm doing, etc. I explain I'm not doing so well due to the car, and he offers his help with my car. Being a damsel in distress, I accept his offer to help me with my car trouble, filing a police report, etc. Because I was very stressed, he offered to take me to lunch, and later offers to come back to my place and cuddle until I calm down. So we end up hooking up again.

After our casual hook up, Al kept texting me non-stop, professing his love for me, and ignoring my requests to be left alone (I didn't want a relationship). One day, I received a 5 page letter addressed to the U.S. Immigration Department, in detail, outlining numerous false accusations stating my initial marriage was bullshit (fraud/federal crime). Although false, these accusations could lead to me being deported and my husband being sent to federal prison. The conditions he offered for not sending the letter would be for me to date him and have a family with him. Although I could prove these allegations are false, it would cost a lot of money, time, etc. and I don't really want to make more trouble for myself (i.e. my husband and I are separated. I don't want the govt. looking into it anyways). Al also told me that if he couldn't have me, no one in this country (U.S.) could have me.

As days went by and I didn't respond to his threats, he started to verbally threaten me, saying it didn't matter if I moved away to a different county, state, or country, he would always follow me until I agreed to his conditions. He would randomly come to my apartment and sit on the doorstep awaiting my arrival. He would post things on my social media accounts, tag me in creepy pictures, message me with threats, the most threatening one being he would follow me until one of ""us"" dies.
Around this point, I began to realize that my car tires were probably were not just some random act of vandalism. This also made me realize that if Al was capable of vandalizing my car, he was capable/serious of causing me a great amount of trouble with the immigration department. Everyday, I grew more paranoid because throughout the day I would receive non-stop text messages from him accusing me of lying to him (in general) and telling me he knew where I was at that exact time. More paranoia sets in and even when driving on the interstate, I couldn't stop looking around me out of fear he was following me. Taking my friend's advice, I ended up going to the police and getting the documentation needed for a restraining order. I filled it out and turned it in.

The next day, I was surprised to find the police at my door telling me to grab my stuff and I was being admitted to a mental institution (in handcuffs) because Al went to the police and told them I was stalking them, and I was probably going to go the police station and file a complaint against him. In turn, Al got a restraining order against me, telling the police everything he did to me I did to him. Another surprise was that the person who handed me the restraining order papers handed me the wrong papers and the restraining order was never filed. On top of all this, Al told the police I was unstable and was threatening to commit suicide. As it is in many states, accusations like this are not taken lightly and when the police came and got me from my apartment, I was taken to the mental institution (in handcuffs) for a 72 hour psych-evaluation.

When I got out today, I was contacted by my supervisor at work informing me that a resignation letter in my name had been turned in saying that I'm resigning from my current position because of my mental illness. Even more, Al informed me I should expect for my colleagues to receive photoshopped pictures of my naked self. Despite my ""stalking of Al,"" he has continued to message me on my social media accounts telling me to put everything he has done in the past and begs me to start a family with him.
I've had to re-do my restraining order paperwork, so the police report is pending and I'm gathering evidence for my meeting with the lawyer tomorrow.

I know its unclear because the collision occurred at an angle (his front right bumper to my mom's rear passenger) but I am really hoping someone can help me catch the guy as the police have been largely unhelpful and apathetic. My mom only had liability insurance so I will have to pay for all this out-of-pocket but, in all honesty, I could not care less about the money, I just want to see this guy brought to justice. My mom is fine now save for some aches and pains but had she not been, the thought of this pr**k just driving off without even checking on her just infuriates me. 

Edit: This happened in Virginia, where the license plate letters are blue and the sequence is three letters followed by four numbers (ABC-1234). 

Edit2: This occurred at the intersection of Huntsman blvd and Sydenstricker rd in Springfield, Virginia. There were some witnesses but they were more preoccupied with helping my mom to get an accurate description of the fleeing vehicle but we do know that it was gray (so the blue must be from the license plate and not the car). One of the witnesses said he thinks the driver was a white male with dark, blackish hair. 

Edit3: My family immigrated to the US ~30 years ago and one thing I have always believed, and was greatly reaffirmed by this incident, is that American altruism is amazing. Despite the occasional bad apple, the fact that strangers will rush to help each other makes this country so beautiful to me. My mother said she had no idea what had happened but when she came to there were people all around her trying to assist her. Being out of town and unable to help immediately...this got me right in the feels. Where we're originally from, no one would have stopped to help.

Edit4: Here are two more pics http://imgur.com/a/6SXm4. I'm sorry that they're not much different than the previous ones but they're all I got. The car has since been demolished.

I posted to /r/offmychest and someone told me about this sub. [Here's the original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ez5d7/i_think_my_friend_was_murdered/) but I'll list the facts as I know them here.

First of all I have large gaps in my memory I believe to be associated with various childhood traumas. One of these gaps covers most of first grade (1995, I think) when my friend Cecilia was killed, but lately I've been remembering bits and pieces. My family told me she was hit by a truck, but they've always acted very odd about the subject. They're still acting strange about it almost twenty years later and I'm starting to suspect Cecilia might have been murdered.

Around the time she stopped coming to school there was an incident where a man with a gun tried to get me and a friend to get in his car. Thankfully my big sister intervened and we ran to my house where my Mom called the police. 

I don't remember if Cecilia was with us too, though my sister doesn't think so. He was gone by the time the cops got to the park, anyway. I don't know if they asked me any questions or what I might have told them if they did, the last thing I remember is my mother on the phone with 911.

All of this happened in Denver, Colorado. We went to Palmer Elementary school. Cecilia would have been six or seven. She was black with short braided hair, brown eyes, and was average height and weight for her age. No glasses or other identifying characteristics. The man I saw at the park was tan, possibly Latino, heavyset, and pimpled. He drove a dented blue car. He had dark eyes and I think he had a sparse mustache, but I'm not sure. He had some kind of hand gun.

So far I haven't been able to find an obituary or much of anything else in the newspaper archives. Someone in my original offmychest thread found an article that might be related--the Cecilia in that case attended a different school and died two years later than I believe this happened, but it's all I've got so far. 

Any information would be helpful, I just want to know what happened so I can finally start to deal with it.",,False,,t5_2tayf,False,,,True,t3_1f0uib,http://www.reddit.com/r/RBI/comments/1f0uib/i_think_my_friend_was_murdered/,

My father is a teacher in his late 70s, trying to support our family and to help me through graduate school. In May, he took on a second job to bring in some extra money. He was contacted by a company from Denmark that offered him the position of a ""purchaser"". My family has lived in Europe, so the possibility that a European company would reach out to my father wouldn't be out of the ordinary. My father's role was to purchase large quantities of technical equipment from the US and send them to Europe. Yes, alarm bells should have been going off, but it was more insidious. After a series of training tests, communications with the company (over email and phone), my father was to make his first three purchases for a total of $25,000. The company required him to purchase a dozen expensive laptops through their bank account in order to make payments on his credit cards, which he used to make the purchase. 

He made a total of three purchases, every single time confirming with his credit card company that money was indeed transferred from the European company's bank account to his own. Three weeks later he was notified by each credit company that the payments he received were returned and that his account is now overdrawn. My father immediately contacted the European company but never heard back from them again. My father has contacted the consul in Denmark to learn that the company no longer exists.

I have their website URL but all the registry info looks fake. The credit companies have determined that my father owes the amounts in full. His lawyer and a lawyer friend of mine have confirmed that he has no legal leg to stand on. My father will likely be declaring bankruptcy shortly.

**TLDR; A company forwarded my father $25,000 to purchase laptops to send to Europe. After receiving the money in his credit card account and making the purchases, the money in his account was returned to the company and he is now responsible for paying off the 25K.**

Not sure if anything can be done. I have the company's URL, some phone numbers, names, and addresses. But it's probably all fake. My parents have contacted multiple lawyers, various US fraud agencies, and their states' attorney general to report the scam. 

Curiously, another company contacted my father soon after about using his address to receive packages in the mail. My father never replied, sniffing out another likely scam. ",,False,,t5_2tayf,False,,,True,t3_xoylq,http://www.reddit.com/r/RBI/comments/xoylq/my_father_was_scammed_out_of_25000/,

There's enough evidence so far to attract the FBI and the state's attorney general (they investigate claims of tax related fraud), but I want to gather more.

This morning I ran across court documents describing how the US government sued a man with the same name as our current city manager 10 years ago for doing essentially the same thing he's doing now.

I'm about 90% sure the two people are one and the same, but how do I prove it? Are there any tools that'll help establish the connection?

**Update - June 26:** 

The mayor of the town in question was elected after the city manager was hired. He's also a former city police chief. When asked if the current city manager was the same one involved in the IRS fraud, the mayor said ""yes, it's the same guy."" Unfortunately, that's not proof enough, at least not enough for me. It is enough to motivate me to continue digging for the link.

Interesting, to me at least, is that I can practically trace this guy's every step in life. I know where he lived as a kid, where he went to school, when and where he bought homes and sold homes, and more. If it's public information, I have it. I actually feel a bit creepy, and certainly more aware now of my ""trail"". 

The most interesting part for me (and maybe obvious to others) is how he goes ""silent"" during the big scandal years. I can find very little public info aside from the court documents for the case itself. I suspect that's because when the United States is taking you to court, you probably can't afford to buy homes, get married, divorced, run for new city government positions, or even die for that matter.",,False,,t5_2tayf,1372391774.0,,,True,t3_1h4bai,http://www.reddit.com/r/RBI/comments/1h4bai/how_do_i_provedisprove_that_the_city_official/,

During and since those three years, both my parents and the doctors involved kept all information about these events secret from me. It's been seventeen years. The events left me with PTSD, phobia, and extreme anxiety which have not faded with time. To recover, I feel I need the details of my treatment and case, but these cannot be obtained from my parents.

I am unsure how much detail I'm allowed to go into. I have one news article referencing the lawsuit, the name of the doctor who misdiagnosed me and my memories. I know that some time in 1996 (give or take a year) I may or may not have been on the show Dateline (The film crew spent the day at our house interviewing my parents and taking some footage of me, but I was not allowed to speak to anyone. The next day, my parents told me that they had cut our segment from the show, so we would not be watching it. I suspect this was a lie.)

Giving the link to the article I've found would reveal my name at the time of the events, though it's not my name now, and I'm unsure if under Reddit policy I'm allowed to identify myself. Since I'm only looking for public records, as without my family's assistance I don't know that I could get private ones, and since the name I had at the time is not my name now, I am not uncomfortable providing the link, but do not want to break any rules.

If no one here can help me search directly, I would greatly appreciate any tips you might offer on locating this almost two decades old information.

It'll be this weekend or Monday before I have a chance to inquire about my medical records. Sadly, I am often strapped for time, and have to run down the leads everyone here has provided at a slow pace. I haven't spoken to my mother yet about this.

Thanks for all the suggestions.  I plan on taking action tomorrow when I go back there (2/7).  I will videotape/record any interactions.  Still not sure of my plan yet, but I do plan on trying.)

A couple of weeks ago, my book bag was stolen out of my car in Burlington, Iowa.  My car was parked just outside my girlfriend's apartment building when it happened.  It had a new IPAD 3 and a lot of expensive clothes, total value around $1000.  I reported it to the police, they came and asked me questions.  I told them about the suspicious looking neighbors that were hanging around the apartment building around the time of the theft.  They called and questioned them, nothing happened.

I just received the IPAD from my work, and I hadn't set up ICloud yet.  Sorry.  I was able to give them the serial number, however.

Fast forward to last night when I was waiting outside for my girlfriend to get there.  I see two black males in their early 20's come around the corner, walking towards the apt building entrance.  One of them is my girlfriend's suspicious neighbor, who was present at the scene of the crime, looking shady as fuck.  

And wouldn't you know it, homeboy is wearing my fucking book bag.  It's an Iowa book bag, with a tiger hawk logo on the back of it and ""IOWA"" in small print under it.  I know 100% that it's mine.  I'm not surprised it was him, but I'm still in awe that this dude is wearing my bag right in front of me at the exact same location he stole it from.

I get out of my car to follow these 2 hood rats and I see the apartment they go into.  It's a floor down from my girlfriends, and its the exact apartment that my girlfriend thought might have done it.

I immediately call the cops and tell them what I just saw.  I get hit with.. ""Okay but the judge is going to ask me how we can be sure that it's your book bag.""  The cops don't do diddly doodoo.

Yesterday, I was sitting on the couch, and I heard a loud bottle rocket and a POP on the side of my house. My wife was outside when this happened, and came running in freaking out because these kids *shot a bottle rocket at her* and it hit my house.
She described the car and I got in mine and found it 2 streets over. I knocked on the door and after some nervous talk behind the door, a girl answered (probably 19) with hair colored blond and black alternately throughout, with a few facial piercings. She looked nervous as hell. I asked ""Does that car there belong to you all? She says ""no, well I mean it belongs to my boyfriend..."" looking down and away, extremely nervous.

I said ""well, your boyfriend just got here after shooting a bottle rocket at my wife in a drive by."" She said ""um....well, that can't be me because I don't even know where you live..."", again, looking down and away.

I said ""tell your boyfriend to watch himself."" and walked away.

Today, my neighbor calls me and tells me he saw some kids throw a bigger firework at my house while I was out and that he ran them down in his car and got some pictures of their car, including license plate, and a FOR SALE sign on the car with his phone number on it!
My neighbor described the girl EXACTLY like the one I talked to the day before, so I know I got it right. He yelled at them, and they looked terrified and drove away. He followed them for just a bit but when he saw a little kid's head poke up in the back window, he just turned around. No need to freak out the little kids just because their dad is a deadbeat.

The police came out at my call and basically said that it's hearsay for now until they have evidence, but he said it sounded like they were scared shitless and probably won't come back after getting caught twice.

My problem is that I can't make out the phone number. It's just a little smudged. The first part is easy: 574-551-xxxx

551 is a standard 3 digits for cell phones in our area. I can't quite make out the last 4 digits. Can anyone make this out, or alternatively, will the license plates help?

He's told everyone including his parents about how amazing, driven, beautiful she is. He even spends hours drawing pictures of her and sending them her way (hes very talented)


Her facebook page: (told to remove)


Now for starters, yes, she's unbelievably attractive, and my buddy is no slouch himself, hes great guy, and funny to boot. I say that because its important that I put emphasis on the fact that my concern is not coming from a place where I think 'she's just out of his league'  - it goes much deeper than that.

Aside from the fact that she is an 'intentional jet-setting supermodel', many things make me worried the entire thing is being hoaxed by some sick troll, who gets pleasure by impersonating this girl, and seducing guys who fall for it.

He has plans to meet her soon...that's why I'm trying to get to the bottom of this. He can take care of himself, But I've know the guy all my life and I'll be damned if I'm going to let some sick weirdo daydream about the possibility of putting my friend in danger. Let alone wound his pride.

It all just feels eerily like that movie Catfish, and I can find NOTHING on this girl.

- They have never spoken on the phone (only text) 
- Text are super girly in nature, almost forced
- They have plans to meet this week
- Again, her facebook is (told to remove)
- Spolier to the movie Catfish http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_YRagi8aiQ

I really appreciate anything you guys can do to figure out / help.


**UPDATE**

They are hanging out tonight.

I've talked to him about it. He thinks i'm jealous...he has zero doubt its her.
Trying to use phrases like ""tine eye"" or ""reverse image search"" is useless with him, hes not stupid - it just doesn't translate to a guy like him.

I tried to break it down to him rationally, but so far he just isn't hearing any of it. He has ZERO doubt.
Apparently they are hanging out tonight. I told him he should have someone with him for safety, his response was that there was no reason to, its her and he'll be fine. Understand that in his head it's her, they both are really into each other, what could go wrong?


**UPDATE 2**

Hey guys, thanks again for staying tuned. 

So, as we all predicted...the meeting never happend...thats all we know. Now that everyone has told him they  think its BS...he's withholding most of whats going on. Not only does he believe the girl is more real than ever, But he's mad at everyone for telling him she could be fake. He thinks that possibility is ridicules, and anyone who tries to convince him otherwise, he laughs at...i've never seen such a severe case off suspended disbelief.

He said to a friend that anyone that doubts her authenticity isn't ever going to meet her, **as punishment.**

Today/Tonight his roommate is going to sneak his phone and copy down the number hes been texting her at, and we are going to take Reddit's (My3rdTesticle) advice and try to figure out if its a google voice number...and call.

**What information can we get with just the number?** How should we go about this?

While anchored, an LCM transport fire control missions for that night to the ship. Shortly after their departure, the seas were very rough. One of the sailors aboard the Higbee had a ball cap with the embossed ""DD 760"" on the front of the cap. There is some confusion as to whether this individual was an officer or an enlisted person. With the high winds and seas, his hat blew off and landed on the side of the LCM in the water. At that time an young Marine named Ron Arnold fished the hat out of the water. An attempt was made to deliver the hat back to the Higbee but the waters were too rough.

Arnold kept the hat and would like to return it to it's rightful owner.

Some love here?,willpower101,92,24,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/RBI/comments/13vy9f/iphone_4s_stolen_while_escaping_a/,"I tried this as askreddit and the reply was ""reddit is not your personal army"" despite all the cool stories of reddit helping track people, license plates, etc. :(

My whole story is TL;DR: People pinned me down in their car after demanding my cash I brought for a phone and sped off. I bailed and ripped my jacket being drug through the streets with one arm half in the car. In my jacket was a new, unactivated, iphone 4s from work with all my contacts sync'd, Find Phone installed but never ran, and my keys to everything. I had my wallet, cash, and personal phone in my pocket.

Info I have:

* Out of State text only phone number of girl doing the deal with me
* Local number of friend/brother's cell phone she was reluctant to use
* Her personal email address she replied from on craigslist
* Maybe her facebook page from that

The police said it's a slow process and they have to subpoena phone records of suspects and such. So my first question would be, where can I find a reliable fee based reverse lookup service? There's a million out there and I was going to try numberguru, but I want to make sure I'm getting quality. **[edit: This still hasn't been addressed]**

**[Edit 1]** **Let me clarify that by 'not helping' I mean:**

* I gave them the perps personal info on a silver platter. 
* The craigslist ad was up from the 23rd (when it happened) all the way to last night and they could have attempted to meet with them. 
* They could create false facebook friends but they said they were unsure about doing that.
* They could have reviewed the tapes with the GM when she was there reviewing them for me, but they didn't.
* They could have taken witness testimonies of people who saw it happen, but they didn't.
* 
I don't care about my work phone, there's just too much info here that they could use to stop these people from robbing others.

**[Edit 2]** **If I post their personal information....**

Can I be **100% SURE** that no one is going to herp de derp and go link them to this thread? Or do something stupid like message ""Gotcha"" to them? Or blow up their phones with text so they turn them off before we can get more info? I don't need a thug with a gun showing up on my doorstep. Nor do we need to inadvertently lower the chances of them getting caught :P

**[Edit 3] Some verification maybe?**

I need advice.",insomniasystems,69,4,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/RBI/comments/131lnk/reddit_my_most_prized_possession_was_stolen_i/,"So I just found out that my 1977 Fender Musicmaster (guitar) was stolen from my Grandparents house (Albuquerque, NM). Here is a crappy [Picture](http://imgur.com/YlwgB) . I bought this guitar when I was 15, because I wanted a Mustang but couldn't afford one. So I bought this and with my Dads help customized it to make a custom Mustang. He helped me rout it and I learned how to solder. Over the years I've constantly been offered money for it after people played it (I even turned down $1000, a lot more than the guitar is worth!) but it was priceless to me so I didn't even consider it. I also worked at USA Custom Guitars for 5 years and built some cool guitars for my self, but they were never as perfect as this Mustang.
So my grand father called me today and told me that my Heroin addicted cousin stole it along with thousands of dollars worth of his tools. Apparently they were helping him get back on his feet after rehab. Had I known he was staying with them I would have had the guitar shipped to me immediately. I recently moved back to S. Florida and knew that I might end up in Colorado so I decided to wait to get it shipped because a couple hundred miles sounded safer (shipping wise) than a couple thousand. Guitars can be fragile, and shipping co's don't treat things well.
Anyhow I need advice on how I might locate the guitar. My cousin has several warrants but is yet to be caught. in fact he can't even be charged with this theft because there is no evidence. At this point I just want my guitar back. It means everything to me and I'll even pay to get it back. I assume he probably sold it at a pawnshop. He definitely didn't take it to Grandmas Music and sound because I used to work there. In fact one of my old co workers was using that guitar to record, so he would have called me if he saw it. It's a one of a kind.
I only ask because I know you guys are Pros at this kind of detective work.
TL;DR- My most prized possession (Vintage Fender guitar) was stolen for drug money- and I need advice on how to locate/get it back.

This car followed my friend home for 15+ miles, even after going 115mph on the freeway and taking two unexpected turns at big intersections this piece of shit Kia Sophia managed to keep up. Unfortunately my friend filmed his ride home at 720p so this may be impossible to get a clear legible picture out of it. This took place in Florida. I saved the grab-frames as PNG images, if there's a better format I could upload them in let me know. I tried playing the clip in VLC but the quality was worse.

edit for clarity on how we know the car was following him: At one point early in the video my friend is stopped at a busy/big intersection, he's in the middle lane of the non-turning lanes(6 lanes total, two turning left, 3 continue straight and one right hand turn lane), you see the car behind him while he's stopped, but then my friend decides to take a different route home so he cuts across the lane to his right (which is a few cars deep, so he gets across by squeezing through a gap of the stopped cars), but yet the Kia manages to catch up to my friend down the street when he catches another red light. I know this is kind of confusing but it's the most telling part of the video showing that he was 99.9% followed by the car.
The point where I took the screenshot is at 14:35 in the video, total length is a little over 17 minutes I believe, so obviously the turn they took was near the ending.

I'm studying abroad in a 3rd world country, and my laptop was recently stolen (abt a month ago). I have Prey running, and get pretty regular reports with IP trace and network info, screenshots and webcam shots. Police are extremely disorganized and lazy here and basically told me there's nothing they can do without his name and address.

Problem is, he mostly just looks at porn and WWE wrestling. Doesn't appear to have email or facebook, or any personal accounts, or at least doesn't log in with this computer. Some girlfriend or sister of his has logged in a couple times, and I have her email and facebook acct info (but no webcam pic).

For fear of getting myself involved in a circle of pretty bad people (the thieves, people who buy their stuff in this country, etc), and being a foreigner in a country with weak law enforcement, what's my best option here?

And, if all else fails, does Prey allow me to reformat or permanently lock the computer, so that they'd have to reformat it or ditch it? I see there is a lock-down option but it's unclear as to what it does. If I can't get the comp back before I leave here in a couple months, I would at least rather they not potentially hack my OS password eventually and have access to my pics, personal info, etc. As it is they are logged into the fake user acct. It's kind of an old comp and it wouldn't be the end of the world if I lost it.

Here's the link where the ad used to be: http://dallas.craigslist.org/ndf/cto/3374730848.html. 

Here's a little bit of the back story:

They talked on the phone, per seller's request, decided to meet at the tax assessorâs office. My cousin asked the seller to meet at the VW dealership to have it checked out. The seller said she will have it inspected before she brings it to the tax assessorâs office and show my cousin the report to save time. 

The seller showed up, my cousin test drove it. My dad also test drove it, looked at the inspection report (it had watermark of Firestone) with a receipt which said balance/payment due $0 â she didnât have to pay for the inspection. A look at the inspection report revealed that everything was either good or OK. Agreed upon $5700 inside the tax assessors office, my cousin paid this amount and told the rep (at the window) she would rather pay $7 for new license plates so there's no confusion with any future tolls.  Signed paperwork and left the office. 
They agreed that my cousin would take the car she had to rent in order to meet the lady at the tax assessor's office so she could drop it at Enterprise and the seller would drive the VW to Enterprise (About 3 miles).

At the parking lot (of Enterprise), my cousin asked the seller if she wanted to come to the office while my cousin returned the keys and paid the balance. Seller said she was ok in the car (VW). 

My cousin paid for the rental car and came back and the seller asked if my cousin wanted to drive. She said the seller could drive herself home  (since she knew the way) and that my cousin would bring back the car. Seller drives the car, with my cousin on the passenger seat and her 3 year old daughter in the back. 

The seller pulled in front of her house (she thinks) and got out. They said bye to each other and my cousin drove back home. 

The next morning my cousin started looking for the inspection report (that the seller showed) to take it to someone to inspect because she could smell something burning (which had actually been discussed with the seller earlier as well but was blamed on a new oil change). This is when my cousin realized it was missing so after work she drove it to the dealership (the one she had originally wanted to take the car to) and there they took over two hours and told her the car was in bad shape, that engine could blow up any time or catch fire or something. They told her the first three things on the estimate had to be done right away. The total bill they estimated was $5500.

Devastated, my cousin called the seller from her cell phone but the seller didnât answer. So then she used her other cell phone (the seller didnât have that number) and this time the seller answered and my cousin told her what the mechanics are saying. Seller said she didnât know what to say. She kept asking what was the reason my cousin brought it to the shop, and my cousin told her the smell was very strong and it was bothering her. My cousin even asked her if she would take the car back and she said she would not do that. My cousin told her she would call her back after a second opinion. 

She called the Firestone in the seller's hometown asking them for a copy of the inspection report that was done on a VW recently. They were not able to find it (or so they said). She called again the next day to speak to someone else at the Firestone, but he was unable to help too.

She called around for estimates, and got a very reasonable estimate from another repair shop, and called the seller again, but again, no answer. My cousin couldn't drive the car so had to keep it at the shop, arrange for the money, and two weeks later after all the repairs were complete, she drove it back home. 

Car value $4000 (according to the mechanic)

She ended up paying $9300 after repairs.

Reddit, I need your help so my cousin can go after this seller in small claims court and recover the cost of repairs, but lawyers are saying that she needs written proof that the car was advertised in proper working condition or ""mint condition"" etc, as some people buy junk cars to fix them up. This is why I need to recover the craigslist ad!

Apparently they never wiped my icloud information, because the other day I checked and now all of their contacts show up in my icloud account, and I can see my phone, though it says offline so I cant track it. The phone is still named what I named it and my name is still on the icloud account. I have their 'mom' and 'dad' contacts on the list. Is there anything I can do? Any way to find their number/name/address? whitepages.com shows the mother and father as unlisted, but it gives the city, same city as me. I went to the police with all of this and they just gave me a case number and said a detective would have to look at it, who knows if they will do anything, even though I just handed them an easy ass way to get my phone back through mom and dad's contacts. Maybe someone who reads this has better tech skills or something that can help me track down this person directly. If I still have somewhat of a view into my phone's stuff, does that mean they did not take my sim card out? I am going to contact at&amp;t tonight to see if the serial number has been activated on their network, even though i told them it was stolen and they told me they red flagged it. Hopefully someone helps!

tl;dr my iphone got stolen but i can see all of their contacts in my icloud account, as well as my phone on the tracking page (although its offline so no tracking)


update: so thanks to lots and lots of help from reddit member VETTE_50_TH, we have managed to track down the person who has the phone, along with their entire family basically. So as soon as im out of work I will be taking all of the new information i have and bringing it to the police to see if they will take action after i basically put a huge spotlight on the person now.

update: detective contacted me and pulled up all these people in the database, looks like their whole family is full of convicted felons. Detective is on the case and told me they would call me to come pick up my phone when/if they get it. Hopefully my next update is me getting the phone back. I just hope if they do get my phone back, these people don't come looking for me.

He was a passenger in a car on his way home from Castro Valley when a car pulled up next to them, yelled something at them and then shots were fired. One of the shots struck Angelo in the head. It was late at night and no one saw anything. 

There was a composite sketch created with the assistance of the driver of his vehicle but it was not very detailed. A $50,000 reward was put out there and yet still, no one has come forward. 

Angelo wasn't a thug or a criminal. He was a student at a local community college and worked part time for his family business. He had a smile that lit up a room. Hundreds of people came to his funeral, have participated in fundraisers for the reward and helped the family pass out flyers. 

It's been ten years since he was taken from us. We just want answers. If you've heard anything or know anyone who has, please, contact the Alameda County Sheriff's department at (510) 667-3622

1366919681.0,55,self.RBI,1d3rf9,"Who is James? Help us solve the African mystery of a flash drive, a physicist, and an unusual set of coincidences.",vickio,72,17,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/RBI/comments/1d3rf9/who_is_james_help_us_solve_the_african_mystery_of/,"RBI, I have investigated this mystery as far as I can myself and am stumped. I'm turning to you for help. The story goes like this:

I am an American living in Tanzania. On Monday, April 22nd, 2013, my friend Michael in Tanzania received a package in the mail from his mother in America. The package had been opened and resealed, which is not uncommon for us because package contents are sometimes checked by the customs office in Tanzania.

Loose, among other items inside the package, and with no note attached to it was a flash drive. He looked on the drive and found three videos and no other files. He played part of the first video and saw that the person in the video addresses someone named Emily. He assumed the flash drive and videos must have been meant for my wife, Emily, so he gave the drive to me.

My wife and I watched the videos, and, though there are some unusual coincidences, neither she nor I recognized the man in the the videos. I gave the drive back to Michael who watched the videos and determined that neither he nor his wife know the man in the videos either. We showed them to others here and no one in our organization recognizes this guy.

At this point, we were rather confused, so Michael contacted his mother in the US and asked about the flash drive. She indicated that she knew nothing of a flash drive in the package!

My own investigative work is included below. **Ultimately, I am hoping to identify the intended recipient of the flash drive so that I can deliver it her.** I believe the easiest way to do that is to identify the man in the videos, find his contact info, and ask him who Emily is. I understand that the posting of personal information on Reddit is forbidden and hope you can help me without violating that rule.

Here is a frame of the video showing James and his surroundings:  
&lt;http://imgur.com/KL8cwbE?&gt;

Here are the actual video files that were found on the flash drive:  
*(REDACTED)*

Here is my case file so far:

### The flash drive ###

*   Lexar JumpDrive TwistTurn USB Flash Drive 16GB
*   Volume name ""LEXAR""
*   Contains three files
    *   ""Video 1.wmv"" (131.8 MB, created 3/26/13 7:20 PM)
    *   ""Video 2.wmv"" (172.8 MB, created 3/26/13 7:24 PM)
    *   ""Video 3.wmv"" (142 MB, created 3/26/13 7:24 PM)
*   A scan of the volume for deleted files reveals nothing

### Notable things that James says ###

*   Video 1
    *   ""Hey Emily""
    *   ""It's James""
    *   ""You've been gone so long""
    *   ""It's Pi day""
    *   ""I hope that you're having a great time in Tanzania""
    *   ""I have included a gift of astronaut ice cream""
    *   ""I hope that it makes [you] less sad to leave Tanzania""
    *   ""I don't know how sensitive they are to alcohol appearing in your classes, but Megan told me to do science demos either for your entertainment...""
    *   ""I don't know if you want to show it to your class or not or if you think I'm just a terrible speaker and you're embarrassed of all your friends""
    *   ""We miss you and I look forward to seeing you in June""
*   Video 2
    *   ""If I were a chemist instead of a physicist""

### Notable items appearing in the videos ###

*   Gray Champion brand t-shirt, worn by James
    *   ""2007 SEC Champions"", ""This is what a champion looks like"", ""LSU Tigers"" (LSU is Louisiana State University)
*   Music stand
*   Vacuum cleaner
*   Photo of an unidentified baby
*   Photo of unidentified people sitting at a table
*   Quinta Do Noval Porto Special Reserve bottle, empty
*   3 Calendars
    1.  Featuring an unidentified comic strip
    2.  Featuring an unidentified politician
        *   Turned to July
    3.  Featuring artwork
        *   Turned to January
        *   ""Art is A Hammer"", by Doug Minkler. ""Art is not a mirror held up to reality, but a hammer with which to shape it. Bertold Brecht"" (I used TinEye to find a larger version of the calendar artwork here: &lt;http://www.robertlpeters.com/news/serendipitous-quotablesâ¦/&gt;)
*   US one dollar bill
    *   Serial number L15396741N

### Things we know about James ###

*   His first name is James
*   He recorded these videos on March 14th
*   He has a friend named Emily who is a teacher in Tanzania
*   He knows someone named Megan who also knows Emily
*   He expects to see Emily in America in June
*   He is, or is studying to be a physicist
*   He may be associated with Louisiana State University

### Things we know about Emily ###

*   She is a teacher
*   She has been in Tanzania for some time
*   She is leaving Tanzania
*   She will be in America in June

### An unusual set of coincidences ###

*   My wife's name is Emily
*   She is a teacher in Tanzania
*   Michael's wife's name is Megan
*   My wife and I are planning to return to America in May and will be in the states in June

The obvious conclusion is that Michael's wife Megan asked her physicist friend James to record videos of science demos for their mutual friend, my wife, Emily to show her students in Tanzania. Furthermore, James recorded these videos, copied them onto a flash drive, and gave them to Megan's mother-in-law to have shipped to Tanzania. We reject this conclusion on the basis of the following facts:

*   Emily denies knowing James, a testimony I have no reason to doubt
*   Megan denies knowing James
*   Megan would not have asked a friend to mail a flash drive containing three videos, since the internet where we live is good enough to receive them online
*   Michael's mother denies having any knowledge of the flash drive in the package she sent or of the videos contained on the drive or of a physicist named James

### A working theory ###

Our current working theory is this:

*   Michael's mother sent him a package with no flash drive in it
*   Someone named James sent a package containing the flash drive to another Emily (not my wife) who is a teacher in Tanzania
*   Both packages were opened by customs in Tanzania and the flash drive was accidentally moved from one package to the other

In support of this theory is the fact that the package Michael received **did not contain the promised astronaut ice cream**.

RBI, can you help us solve this mystery?


**UPDATE (4/26):**  
/u/rr645 found [a blog](http://emilytotanzania.wordpress.com) which is written by someone named Emily with the following similarities to the Emily we are looking for:

*   She is currently teaching chemistry in Tanzania
*   She is returning to the states in June 2013
*   She has a poor internet connection (which explains why James would mail her a flash drive)
*   She specifically mentions missing ice cream

/u/rbidetective noticed that the Emily from that blog studied at the University of Wisconsin. He then found a [list of University of Wisconsin Department of Physics grad students](http://www.physics.wisc.edu/people/gradstudents) and one in particular named James who looks like the man in the videos.

With that info, I found the Facebook profile for that particular James, and his Facebook networks include Wisconsin and... LSU! Searching his Facebook friends for people named Emily I found the Emily from the blog! (Confirmed with info from her LinkedIn profile.)

I will attempt to contact James and Emily on Facebook and will update again if hear anything. Thanks RBI!

**UPDATE 2 (4/26):**  
/u/rr645 has received a response from Emily to a comment he left on her blog. She has confirmed that the James seen in the video screenshot on this post is her friend and that she is the intended recipient of the flash drive! I have received a PM with her personal contact info and will arrange to give the flash drive to her.

1375256154.0,51,self.RBI,1jept7,Posting for a friend: Mother missing in Jamaica...,Faberbutt,65,14,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/RBI/comments/1jept7/posting_for_a_friend_mother_missing_in_jamaica/,"This is long but please bare with me.

As the title says, I'm posting this for a friend. This is not a new case, it has been ongoing for years, and I do not know all of the details. She asked me to post this for her for advice, and so here I am.

Anyway, my friend is a Canadian. A few years ago, her mother moved from Canada to Jamaica and married a man there. This man began to be abusive soon after the marriage and the last contact that my friend had with her mother was an email telling her that she was getting a divorce and that she would call soon. 

She never did. It has been about 3 years and there has been no sign of her. No phone calls or emails, her Canadian bank account has gone unused, her passport is expired. 

From what I've been told, the investigation by the Jamaican authorities into her disappearance was a joke... My friend, of course, suspected her mother's husband from the beginning and told them as much, and why... They proceeded to ask the husband if he knew anything about her disappearance, which he denied, and they refused to investigate him any further.
 They told her ""We asked him if he knew anything and he said no, so we don't have anything to investigate"". They stopped investigating within days.

The man was remarried within months of her disappearance. 

My friend has sent letters and made phone calls to Jamaican and Canadian authorities and politicians. They have all basically told her that she's shit out of luck, that there's nothing they can do. 

Lately, my friend has been getting prank calls from Jamaica. It is the same man every time... At first he didn't block his number but now he is and his voice is the same... At first he claims to be from the FBI and asks her questions about her mother. She asks for the man's name and contact information so that she can verify that he is with the FBI and he switches to taunting her about her mother... Making explicit remarks about things that have supposedly been done to her and that he will do to her. 
During the phone calls, she can hear dogs barking in the background and kids yelling and screaming.

She has tried reporting these phone calls to the local police but, of course, there's only so much they can do and half the time they don't even answer their phone or answer her messages (police force covers three towns, with a total population of under 6,000 combined and they have only a handful of officers).


She has been at a loss for years. Her resources are limited, especially since her mother disappeared in a foreign Country. She doesn't know what to do.... I'm posting here for advice. Does anyone here have experience with this sort of situation or otherwise know any steps that she can take to have her mother's disappearance properly investigated by Jamaica? Anything that she can do to get Canada to put pressure on the Jamaican government to do something?

I'm a student at the University of Chicago.

These emails were sent through MailChimp, and signed with my name in an attempt to impersonate me. Thankfully MailChimp has shut down the account involved. 

Through some sleuthing I was able to determine from WHOIS / DNS records who runs the server running UChicagoAnon.com. This person lives in East Brunswick, New Jersey.

Helpful comments there, and someone suggested that I x-post to this forum. 

I've been receiving anonymous phone calls and text messages from a stalker for over year. She is a woman who had a fling with my ex, and is a sociopath at best. The total number of call and texts is easily 150+. 


My phone carrier has tried to help but the messages don't appear anywhere in call logs. I was under the impression that all calls are logged no matter if they're inbound or outbound.

(Example: make a call at 12:00, receive anonymous stalker call at 12:30, call phone company at 12:40. All the phone company sees is my call at 12:00 and the call to them at 12:40.)


The current round of text messages show a series of random numbers as the 'sender' number. Always random, but never exactly the same. In the past she could assign any return number she wanted to the texts and used mostly out of state business numbers.

She is likely using her iPhone to make the calls and send the texts. Police have been investigating this for some time. They've questioned the stalker (who denied everything) and believe it is her that is responsible, but cannot act without some evidence.

To be clear, there is NO doubt who is doing this.


Questions:
NEW: how can there be a call or sms that the phone company has NO record of? 

- Is anyone aware of such a program which can make calls or send SMS which can't be identified by the phone company?
- What else can I do to try and expose the source so the court can act?",,False,,t5_2tayf,False,,,True,t3_1atgja,http://www.reddit.com/r/RBI/comments/1atgja/xpost_from_rprivacy_stalker_is_calling_and/,

&lt;some backstory&gt; Ive been asking about my dad since I was about 16. For as long as I can remember, my mom has been vague on the subject. Often ignoring my requests. Let me begin by saying Im now 38. I have 2 other siblings. A brother that is 37 and a sister that is 24. Up until about a year ago I learned that my brother and I have different dads. Up until 2 days ago, I learned that the man my sister thinks is her father is not.
I initially asked my mom some family history when my son was born 17 years ago. You know the standard was anyone in the family suffering from this or that. My mom said that no one on her side had any major ailments. So I asked about my dad. She says nope sharply and left it at that. 2 years pass and my wife at the time gets preggo with my daughter. Same medical history questions only to be shot down again. I let it go with the occasional here or there questions. Still cold.
Last year, I went to my 20 year HS reunion. I saw my mom and asked her again about my dad. I had some suspicion but nothing concrete and I didnt want to rush some guys house saying Im your kid. She says she has some errands to run but call her later. I tell her Im only in town for 2 days and that this is important that I know who my dad is. She says call me. Later that night, I call her. Nothing. I leave VM after VM and it takes her two days after Im home for her to answer. Im asking her about my dad and shes being very secretive about it. I ask her did she grow up with a father and she said yes. When she couldnt talk to her mother, she could talk to her dad. I ask her to give me that opportunity.
She begins to tell me that I (she) did the best that I could. ""Things could have been different. I had choices. I didn't have to have you"". Of course this enraged me. Did my mom just say to me that she could have aborted me but choose otherwise?! She then goes on to continue to say that I didn't deserve to know who my dad was. Finally I told her then fine. Ill find out on my own. I asked her if my brother and I had the same dad. She at least confessed to that. She said she would take the information to the grave. She doesn't care if she doesn't have a relationship with me or my kids (her grandkids).
Its been about a year since I last spoke to her. She calls me on father's day to wish me a happy father's day. Kinda insult to injury if you ask me. I ask her if she is willing to tell me the information I want to know. Of course she wouldn't.
I sunk to a low and contacted a couple of talk shows in desperation but that has led to nowhere. So now, I ask your help if you can. I can give some facts and some speculations but nothing is solid because I have no leads. Information I know:
The guy on my birth certificate may or may not be my actual dad. I know the man and some history but he wont talk to me directly. Ive contacted his sister and his daughter. I know his address but he refuses to talk to me citing that my mother knows the truth and that she should be the one to tell me. Basically it's none of his business. Things began to really unravel when I transfered from private school to public school. I went by my moms last name. The school asked for a birth certificate and low and behold, my last name was different. I grew up in a poor neighborhood but somehow my brother and I managed to go to private school. Recently I found out my mom was arrested when I was 6 for 2nd Degree Grand theft. (trying to find out if this has some connection). Can you guys help. Im willing to give up some personal information on all parties involved. I would hire a PI, but I don't know who to investigate. I plan on trying to get a DNA sample, but if this guy wont talk to me, I doubt hes giving up DNA.

UPDATE 2: The university police have been asking for a lot of information on me (address, name, dob, phone number). Is this just part of the routine? Is there a reason for this? 

UPDATE 3: I just called the police and was told that he is ok. They are evaluating him and a relative is flying over to help him with some issues he's had. 

Thank you guys for the tips! I'm glad you got me to call police and they were able to find him in time. ",,False,,t5_2tayf,1340660261.0,,,True,t3_vkl2c,http://www.reddit.com/r/RBI/comments/vkl2c/a_friend_is_no_where_to_be_found_his_phone_is/,

They got between 1-2 months house arrest and 88 hours of community service.,imagegami,62,11,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/RBI/comments/141bho/update_number_31_i_was_almost_beaten_to_death_by/,"This is the 3rd update.  It has been a long time, I am sorry for the delay in my updating.  I would first like to say that the support you have given me was outstanding.   (beware!!! wall of text) 


The one case that was brought to adult court, the kid pleaded guilty to only two charges.  Aggravated assault 1a (F1) and CC (F1).  I can't link directly to the pdf but you can look if up using [pa_common_pleas](http://ujsportal.pacourts.us/DocketSheets/CP.aspx), change search type to participate name.  
 
* last name=    aldridge
* first name=   shane
* county=       delaware  


Some of you may have noticed that the last 2 have been cleared of information.  I did this for my own sanity. I **stupidly** attended a meeting at a coffee shop with some people from Delaware county juv. court.  At that meeting I was told that if I didn't stop looking I would be brought up on charges.  After stating that I only used open source information. The point was still pressed.   While they will say they never said anything like, but if you read between the lines it is what they said by using words such as ""someone could be"" or other pronouns like that. 


I filed a complaint with the office of the victims advocate because I was not getting notified of home passes being given. Magically the day that OVA start looking into it, I get a call saying that a home pass was given the prior weekend.  Yet it clearly states on [arcfamily](http://www.arcfamily.com/faqs.html) that they go home monthly. They were also using conference calls to communicate with the person that is in that facility. By having the person say he had a gf, she would call in and they would be conferenced in after id/auth. was made the facility.    


The Delaware county probation department looked at the pictures and basically laughed, while they sounded concerned when talking to me, nothing has changed. It took a call from a senator's office to even get ""random drug tests"" placed on the one that weren't transferred to Philadelphia.  


The Philadelphia probation department is a **FUCKING JOKE**.  While I was using double and triple verification for information I would get, they would dismiss all of it because the victim was bring the information to them.  I had one guy tell me that I wasn't allow to even be on twitter (That isn't a joke, he told me I wasn't allowed to view www.twitter.com). I had to teach another probation officer how to make the character ""_"". 


Everyone said get a civil lawyer.  I had one at the time. They dropped the case after 5 months.  The next lawyer dropped the case as well.  I am on lawyer #4 waiting to hear if they will take the case.  I don't get straight answers from them as to why they can't bring a lawsuit just keywords.  It just seems to be out of everyone's scope.  I don't even think they had the parents list assets or anything like that.

**If anyone knows a great personal injury lawyers that focuses on cases dealing with juveniles  around the philly area that would be willing to take this case please let me know.**

[6 girls charged as adults](http://www.delcotimes.com/articles/2012/09/28/news/doc506486d756225291567064.txt) African-American.  The incident took place 3.1 miles from the location of my assault. While I feel bad for the lady that this happened to.  The punishment was different because they had a video and caused less damage?  This video [Jack_Whelan_DA](http://www.clipsyndicate.com/video/play/3775680) @ -58 sec that is perplexing.  If that statement would have been made 6 months prior perhaps this wouldn't have happened to the poor lady.  


How the above relates to my story is by what the chief of police said ""Some of the kids we arrested this time we've had numerous times,"" Ruskowski said. ""They're not even worth the air they're breathing."" He even called the DA about this. [source](http://articles.philly.com/2012-04-05/news/31294492_1_ruskowski-puncture-wound-smoke)  I guess if the color of your skin is equal in color you get 1/5 of the justice?

2. My wife's phone made two phone calls right after it was taken. We called the numbers and one lady was kind enough to give us her first and last name.  
3. Later that night my wife's ""Find my iPhone"" app pinged the phone at at a strip mall at 27th and Center. There is a Boost mobile and a check cashing store there. I called the cell phone store they say they don't buy cellphones. I spoke to the check cashing place, they have camera's that cover the storefronts and some of the lot.  

The gas station and the strip mall both have security camera's, we know exactly when the person/person's were there. What should I do next? I'm also assuming the lady who gave us her name knows who called her on Saturday. How do I get a police officer to ask her?

I have Prey Project, Cerberus App and Lookout mobile security installed on it. Also I didn't set any pincode or security to open og turn it on. So everybody can have access to it. But I did put up security - everytime someone tries to open facebook, gmail or something else that would compromise my persona - it ask for a pincode. That way, maybe a thieft would use the phone... And I could track him down easier. 

But none of the programs can give my any data, since they have problems connection to the phone. Even though, when I call it - it gives my the ringtone...

Also when I go to google play, I tried to install apps on it. And it says it done it without problems....

Im from Denmark, Copenhagen - if it helps.

Basically, I have almost no money and I have an opportunity to go abroad and possibly perform for agents who are interested in me. (not a sketchy situation, I have more details if people are interested.) However, I need money to do that.

Many years ago, my mom would tell me about a CD that my grandparents left for me when they died when I was little, and how it was near $15,000 in initial money + interest. When I turned 18, she woke me up at like 8 AM and forced me to go down to the bank to sign it over to me, so that my father couldn't have access to it if she were to unexpectedly pass away. Needless to say, they didn't have a good relationship.

Two years ago, my parents (who are kind of crazy I will admit) stopped speaking to me on account of my significant other, who is of a different race than I am. We haven't spoken for two years.
Long story short, I really want that money and before we stopped speaking, I asked about it (when I first graduated college) and all my mom would say was ""I don't want you spending that, it's for saving, you can just ask me for money"". I am not even sure what bank it is at but I do have a few ideas (commerce, chase, or TD bank.)

Is there any way to track down this money? Could I call and just give my social security number?

My icloud account had been signed on to the laptop but bootcamp always booted windows. In the first 3 months there was no activity at all but the laptop miraculously started sending me it's location. Whom ever had the macbook had figured out how to boot into the mac side. I called up the police and opened up a case. And for months I have been gathering data on it's location.

I still didn't have much information to retrieve the laptop... I kind of just gave up but kept having Find My iPhone give me it's location to gather up an archive of where it's located and used most. Today months after all this tracking I look through my contacts and see two names I have never seen before. One was an odd Spanish first and last name, the second contact was called mi amor mesa which means my love mesa. I went on Facebook and copied the phone number. It gave me a profile and I was even able to verify this person lived in the area where my laptop was being tracked. I lurk through the profile and I see he's in a relationship with a woman who's last name happens to be mesa.. coincidence? 

oh wait there's an email too???? not sure if it was a typo but the word music in it was spelled as miusic...

Looking at his Facebook photos he seems to be into the whole hey I'm a cuban with a mac making music scene.

Think I've found the person who has my laptop and if I give the detective on my case this information he'll actually help me retrieve it?

*Investigators are currently searching for a silver minivan, possibly a Chrysler Town &amp; Country, that was last seen in the area prior to Heeringaâs disappearance. The evidence is based on a passerby observing the car parked near the gas station and driving away, police said.

The driver is described as a white male, approximately 30 to 40 years old, 6 feet tall, medium to heavy build with broad shoulders, light brown or sandy blonde wavy hair parted in the middle and slightly longer on top. He was last seen wearing a bright red or orange sweatshirt, police said.

Heeringa is described as a white female, 5 feet 1 inch tall, about 110 pounds, with blond, shoulder-length hair and blue eyes. Heeringa is also known to wear wired rim glasses. She may be wearing a blue collared shirt with âSternberg Exxon"" on it, the police chief said.

Any way to track them down?,harassed_and_mad,44,5,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/RBI/comments/pi1iv/someone_on_youtube_is_dropping_my_familys_dox_and/,"Semi-xpost from [/r/ronpaul](/r/ronpaul) but with added info.

*I'm posting this as a throwaway because whoever is harassing us has already collated enough of our personal information and (should they find this) I'd rather they not be able to dig through my standard Reddit account, too.*

Some context: My husband and I are both active making Ron Paul videos on YouTube, mostly in the talking head format. In mid-January, he made [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOIIcWyXJEs) about the Jere Brower fiasco. On Monday, a large number of people began making hostile comments and downvoting the video (fair play on YouTube), but then one of them (and I should note that these were mostly brand-new accounts created that day) posted our home address repeatedly in several comments and kept threatening to ""come over.""

Of course, we reported the privacy violation to YouTube and filed an incident report with the local police, just in case. Fast forward to last night, when another brand-new account posts several comments dropping not just our home address, but my husband's work phone, our personal emails, my cell phone, etc. etc... and threatens to come over again. We file another privacy complaint about *that* new sock puppet account with YouTube and update the police, who can't do anything because they claim that individually, all of the items are technically publicly available, and there isn't really such a crime as ""threatening to trespass.""

So all we're left able to do is ignore the douchebags as much as we can, delete the dox comments as they appear, and cross our fingers. 

But since a lot of the comments are Jere Brower-ish in style and were initially posted on the Brower-tagged video, we *did* think that whoever's harassing us might be involved with the ""Stop Ron Paul"" Facebook group or whatever's left of it. And that's where you come in, Reddit. Do any of you know if it's still around, and if so, is any of it publicly accessible? If our dox are being dropped there or we're being targeted by name, it'd really help our harassment case. Also, they're dicks.


**More info**

These are the usernames of the dox-droppers who have threatened us, and their suspected sock puppets (or members of the same group). The ones in bold are the ones who have explicitly dox-dropped and threatened us.

***TL;DR***

Harassed and dox-dropped by people who may be either Brower or part of the same group. What's the status of the group now, and wat do?

**Update 12:52PM Pacific**

So I found the group on Facebook. Here are the relevant threads -- we just received the posted images via a fake email from John Vigil.


[First photoshop](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=318864974826020&amp;set=o.219367058137448&amp;type=1&amp;ref=nf) / [imgur'd for posterity](http://i.imgur.com/GhLhf.png)

Be sure to read all the comments if you really want to rage. At this point I'm pretty convinced they're just trolls and not as worried about my person safety, but really - do these people have no personal ethics at all?

**Update 12:59PM Pacific**

So it turns out that Jere Brower is still up to his old tricks and appears to have been behind this harassment campaign. If you load more posts twice at the bottom of the [Stop Ron Paul 2012 group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/219367058137448/), you'll eventually come across [this one](http://i.imgur.com/S1bhB.png) where it seems that Brower himself is helping call the shots.

There's also another [malicious shitty shoop](http://i.imgur.com/GZJgQ.png) of my husband.

Wow, [this one](http://i.imgur.com/yNzxT.png) isn't specific to us, but holy shit. They want Paul supporters in dog crates and electric collars?

**Update 1:10PM Pacific**

Okay, holy shit. I found [the original thread](https://www.facebook.com/groups/219367058137448/247541001986720/) where they found G and started harassing us. [Screencapped](http://i.minus.com/ibjBUDblcg1jV6.png) for posterity.


**Update 3:11PM Pacific**

Well, their taste for us still hasn't passed. They just posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/0P0BX.png), which isn't as directly insulting as the previous ones, but ""vesty"" appears to be their nickname for my husband. They've insinuated that he's gay more times than I can count now. :P

Since we know who they are now and I'm keeping records of all of this -- anybody think that there's any grounds for legal action against these people? Or should we just shut our traps and let it pass?

I know G wants to make a video documenting our harassment, but I'm concerned it'll just escalate their behavior, and might risk putting us in actual danger. Thoughts?

**Update 3:42PM Pacific**

Okay, great, so they've uploaded [this picture](http://i.imgur.com/SBjNY.png) along with the claim that ""We're not done with vesty boy yet."" Awaiting harassment. Will report as it occurs.


**Update 4:04PM Pacific**

Edward Jordan has just posted [this modification](http://i.imgur.com/IrQLr.png) of the previous picture, using my husband's and Ron Paul's faces instead of the originals. Have reported the image to Facebook for harassment. [A few minutes later with a few more comments](http://i.imgur.com/6cXaw.png).

**Update 4:18PM Pacific**

G is collating together everything that's happened today to email the sheriff, but someone down below also mentioned that our state is relevant if we'd like to receive any useful legal advice. We're in Nevada. What are our options regarding restraining orders, civil suits, etc.?

**Update 4:29PM Pacific**

Edward Jordan has posted [another version](http://i.imgur.com/DgrgT.png) of that image from earlier, this time paraphrasing a line from the video that got them so riled up, and adding an intimation that my husband would enjoy receiving a rectal exam from Ron Paul. What the fuck is wrong with these people that they're so *fixated?*

It's also come to my attention that Jere Brower is a [Google employee in Atlanta](https://plus.google.com/107832480148498044191/about). Surely they have some kind of social networking policy that frowns on this kind of internet stalking?

**Update 6:22PM Pacific**

I'd hoped they'd have settled down by now, but Edward Jordan has posted several more mean-spirited photoshops, one portraying Paul and my husband [as white supremacists](http://i.imgur.com/jVGNr.png) and one of them at a [gay pride parade](http://i.imgur.com/z5SzP.png).

Several people have already analyzed it and at least what is **was not** (including an actual storm!):

The official explanation is that it was chaff released from a local defense testing arsenal (Redstone).  This is a highly usual explanation though due to the fact it showed up as up to 10 miles wide and 1 mile tall and lasted for almost 9 hours. 

I am hoping to avoid any of the tinfoil hat stuff here, and am interested in some actual scientific evidence pointing to an explanation such as a local Redditor finding some chaffe on his care, or someone with any real knowledge on this subject.

But my wife's jewelry was taken that was inherited and is irreplaceable. It makes me sick someone would do this.   

Fast forward to a week later. My neighbor told me one of the suspects was arrested (tl;dr arrested for something else, neighbor that called 911 ID'd the kid as the one she saw that day). Oh, I should also mention, that the neighbor the day after the break in was walking her dog with her toddler and saw the kids again, she snapped a picture of them because it looked like they we're scoping out houses. Cops came, but they were already gone by then. They live in the same complex of condos.

So I go to Google and I find the arrest log, arrested on three charges (including burglary). So then I search for the County Court and I find the kids case. He's only being charged with one of the three, criminal threats (the burglary isn't one of them).     

I talked with the Sheriff, he confirmed a suspect was arrested relating to my case, they said they searched the house, but didn't find anything (no idea how thoroughly they searched or if they even knew what to look for, especially with the jewelry). They say hopefully a print hits since he's in the system now. But it doesn't sound too promising. I can only confirm that one of the kids was arrested, but we are 100% there was two involved and the neighbor that called 911 is pretty damn sure there was a third.     

So I have the arrest report, the court case info, *and* his name. So being the neckbeard that I am, I searched Facebook. Bingo. Found the kid's profile that was arrested, and pretty sure I found the second kid (based on his Facebook picture and the picture my neighbor took) and it's the kid's cousin. The profiles are either private, semi-private, or they just don't post on Facebook ever.    

So where do I go from here? I don't get a shit about the video games and computer that was taken. I have data backed up and we have insurance to replace those items. I care about getting the jewelry back. At this point, from talking with the police it sounds like they are done on their end unless a fingerprint matches. Because there are no witnesses of them actually going into the house or my stuff found in their house, that's that.  But I have their names and pretty sure I have their Facebook profiles. I was thinking about making a fake profile and trying to scrape information that way, but not sure if that's the way to go or what.    

Should I just drop it? Anything more I can do? Any ideas?   

The arrest record and court records are public information, but I don't want to post them (for now) because it'll be just as easy for everyone here to find their Facebook pages as it was for me.   

Thanks gang.  

PS. I say kid throughout this, but the kid arrested was 18. I just say kid because I'm 30 and he's a little shit that breaks into people's houses.

PPS. Yes, we have started checking pawnshops and cash for gold places to see if anything turns up there. In California they have to wait 30 days before selling anything (assuming they are legit). Furthermore, from the couple of pieces that we still have and shown them, each one said they would not buy it because it's not real gold (which we knew). There we're some real gold pieces and diamonds though, we just don't have any examples of those to show the pawn shops.

But her new dark blue 2010 Audi A4 was stolen. She was at a going away party 2 days ago with the entire family in PA at the time. It is too convenient it went missing when no one was home, in-between the hours of 2PM and 7PM. She had the car parked out in front of my cousin's Cul-De-Sac house and we are convinced that one of my cousin's drug dealing friends stole it. One of my cousin's got a call during the party to ask if they, my aunt, or my uncle were around.(possibly a telemarketer but I am suspicious) My cousin told them no. So the opportunity to snag it was there. Also the car has laser locks, meaning it is hard as hell to hotwire. On top of that no glass was left at the scene, meaning forced entry is not likely. My sister says she lost a key at my cousin's house, between the dates of May 18-May 20. Meaning it is likely that it was actually stolen from by one of the drugies without her knowledge. The car had GPS but not lowjack, the Audi dealership said they can't track it through the GPS which majorly sucks.

She sunk a lot of money into this new car, and is moving to Cali with her Marine boyfriend tomorrow...so kind of urgent. And the cops aren't following any leads or doing anything short of putting it in a nationwide database.

The [Car](http://i.imgur.com/78aWc2K.jpg) has Pennsylvania plates. License Plate number jdy-0084. Last seen on 306 Ainstree Court, Vienna, Va 22180. The car is also automatic.

Please contact me and/or the police if you have any information. Thank you. We need to stop it before it ends up in a chop shop.


My suspicion is if this was someone that stole my sister's keys a month ago than they have already got a buyer and the car is probably gone. But I am hopeful. I don't know if they would go and try and sell it on Craig's List. But I figured that would be a good place to sell off parts if they don't have a chop shop, or think they can make more money on their own. I was told that tires and wheels are the first thing they would probably sell off the Audi online. My sister doesn't know for sure what kind of tires she had but I think they were goodyear size 225/50R17.

I was wondering if it is at all possible for me to get my money back from a supposed well known scam. I live in a college student only apartment complex, and a young man approached me and asked me to help him win a contest before he goes to the marine corps. He even told me a sad story about his sister who died in a drunk driving accident. 
His information was inconsistent (I should have known..), but he cited a communication disorder that made me bleed sympathy. 
I continued to badger him with questions but he eventually sold me, and made it extremely evident that he was not going to leave without a sale.
He told me that I can get an immediate refund and that he still gets to win points to a trip to Italy (this is why he's selling) if I get the refund.. But I'm afraid that I will overdraw my bank account with the check that is supposed to be held for 21 days and I am supposed to get a call for an authorization.. 

The affiliated company is MTS Circulation LLC and I looked them up. According to the Better Business Bureau, they're a fraud..
I'm so nervous now. I really don't have a lot of money, and I gave him $55 cash, and 3 checks for $55 in efforts to help him win the contest. I'm afraid that I won't see my money again! 

UPDATE: Thanks, RBI! You guys are amazing! I'm really lucky to have this source for help. I am stupid for falling for this; but YOU GUYS DO NOT FALL FOR THIS. 
Anywho, I did stop payments on the checks that I wrote to the dumbass company and I'm going to close my bank account (and reopen another w/in the same bank) in about an hour and a half. Any advice as to what I should say exactly to the people at the bank? 

UPDATE #2: I took care of everything at the bank, Thanks again, RBI. My bank was really chill about everything and waved all of the fees and helped me open a new account.

If you guys think there is anything that can be done to find some background info before I approach real LEO's (and which ones should I contact), please let me know.  A lot of what the company deals with is political-based.

**Background**

I purchased a magazine and noticed an add for a symposium (that related to my field of study) that would take place in a month close to my home town.  I signed up early and payed the $169 registration fee.  A few weeks later I received a polite email stating the symposium would be postponed until next year and that I had the option of receiving a refund or purchasing 3 years subscription to the magazine.  Naturally I chose a refund as the subscription rates were a ripoff.  A month later, and after numerous emails, I had yet to receive my money.  He (the president of the company) was very shady and stated that he never got my emails, even though gmail confirmed that they were received.  Naturally, I started to do some digging and found some interesting info.

**Current situation**

The president/owner of the company also owns at least 3 other similar companies.  One or two of them are non-profits, while one of them is a for-profit.  The non-profits have been taking donations from donors, who they keep anonymous, though some digging shows the names of some donors.  Since the early 90s, the companies have received over $15 million worth of grant revenue.  The problem, however, is that these funds are then transferred to the for-profit and they are not used for any sort of research.  The company then uses their money to lobby hate-speech.  Further research indicates that the companies have no physical address, just a PO box.  Some of the people involved are former gov't employees.  I apologize if Im rambling or if this post lacks proper flow.

**TL;DR** Company A is essentially a tax avoidance entity set up to collect funds from donors and commission research to company B.  Company B then uses that money to promote hate-speech and supports radical political movements.   Both companies are owned by the same person.  A lot of people involved are former gov't, foreign military, and radical rightwingers.

I was in a pretty bad accident at a gas station last thursday. Wasn't wearing my belt either so that didn't help. Basically I was making a turn into the gas station and the guy was speeding furiously in the middle of the two lanes and hit me, backed up and sped off. This happened in North Highlands, CA (Zip 95660). I tried to chase after him but only got the first four digits of his license plate. Cop said he couldn't do much until I have the full plate but he did see the accident on camera. Unfortunately the camera was horrible and gave me these next three images. Hopefully some reddit detectives have some good tools to extract the numbers or find out what type of car this was. I believe it was a white ~~hatchback~~ Subaru Wagon. Thanks for the help..

**TL;DR:** Anyone know how to get a list of MAC Addresses off a DLink router that have been connected in the past few days?

I am currently renting a place in London, Ontario. And at the moment it is just me, one roommate (whom his dad is the landlord), the landlord, 2 contractors for basement renovations, and a coworker that have been inside the house since Friday that I know of.

Friday morning, I got a ride from a coworker home for the weekend. We had left at around 10am. My roommate, left with his family later that day leaving the contractors here for the weekend.

Saturday, the contractors were still working on the project downstairs, but had left several times to pick up materials. Eventually, at about 6pm, they started closing shop to go home. They were instructed by the landlord to close all the doors and windows, then turn on the AC and lock the door behind them.

No one was at the place Sunday.

Monday (today) comes around, and I went upstairs and noticed my safe was missing, plus the 46"" TV downstairs. Once my roommate and their fam came over, we found that they took the PS3 as well. which is where I am asking you guys to help me figure out how to get a list of mac addresses that have been connected to the network.

I called D-Link, specifically asking for PREVIOUS mac addresses, and the guy ended up giving me a list of current devices and telling me it wasnt possible after 20 min.

**SUMMARY:**

Stolen Items:

1. PS3

2. Small Safe

3. 46"" TV

Clues:

1. Broken window screen

2. Window to basement left open

3. A hand mark on the wall in the basement by the window (but the cop said it didnt make sense as to where it was, prob was contractors)

4. Kitchen Table moved aside (more room to take TV through back door I assume)

5. Knives for garage side door removed (prev owners shoved knives through the door frame to hold door shut

6. Thieves left computers, computer monitors, and power tools alone.

JOHNS ISLAND, S.C. (WCIV) -- The last few weeks couldn't have been better for Robert and Elizabeth Paige. Marley Lion, Elizabeth's oldest son and Robert's stepson, had just graduated from Academic Magnet and was looking forward to starting his freshman year at Clemson.

The recent high school grad was a two-sport athlete in grade school and was, according to his mother, admired by everyone -- and that's how he'll be remembered.

Lion was shot around 4 a.m. Saturday morning in a parking lot just off Savannah Highway near Famous Joe's. He later died at MUSC.

""I don't think he was really aware of the darkness that goes on in the neighborhood behind that area,"" Elizabeth said.

Friends and family say Lion drove his truck off the road, and instead of attempting to make the entire trip back to his house, decided to spend the night sleeping in the back of his truck. That's when Robert says things went wrong.

""It was just moments after he had laid down that the first suspect came up and tried to jimmy the door,"" he said. ""Then seconds after that, the second fellow came up and shot Marley through the window.""

After the hearing gunshots, a neighbor called police. When EMS arrived they found Marley just barely hanging on.

""He was pretty bad off when they first got there, but he was able to talk a little bit and tell them that they tried to rob him,"" Robert said.

Not long after being transported to MUSC Marley Lion passed away.

""He had some time to think about things and pray and that helps us,"" Elizabeth said. ""We know that these things go on. Now children are not guaranteed to outlive their parents. It's a part of the world we live in. People lose family members all the time. We are one of those people now.""

No funeral arrangements have been made public at this time. Academic Magnet has chaplains available for classmates needing counseling.

**Surveillance footage shows shooting of Marley Lion** 
Police ask for help identifying gunman and person of interest

**Charleston police have released surveillance footage from the shooting of 17-year-old Marley Lion** and are asking the community to help identify a suspect and a person of interest in the investigation.

Marley Lion, a recent graduate of Academic Magnet High School, was shot inside his Nissan Pathfinder early Saturday morning in the parking lot by Famous Joe's Bar and Grill at 1662 Savannah Highway, and around 4:05 a.m., police found him lying on the ground beside the vehicle. Lion was still alive at the time, and he told an officer he had been sleeping in the car because he was too intoxicated to drive home. He said **two black males walked up to the vehicle and one of them shot him five times** before they left the parking lot on a gravel path toward Yew Street.

- [Marley Lion shooting surveillance video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgMOuc_otL8)

Police say the **gunman is a black male who appears to be taller than the vehicle, putting him in the range of 5 feet 8 inches to 6 feet tall. He has a medium to stocky build** and was wearing a striped or checker-patterned shirt at the time of the murder, and he fled on foot toward the Ardmore neighborhood afterward, according to the police investigation.

""Obviously what you saw there is the best piece of evidence that we have,"" Charleston Police Chief Gregory Mullen said of the video footage in a press debriefing. ""What we also recognize is that there's somebody in our community today that can help us identify who that person is who committed this crime.""

Earlier in the pre-dawn hours, about **20 minutes before the shooting took place, the same surveillance camera captured footage of a man striding briskly across the parking lot. This man, described as a black male in a long white T-shirt wearing dark baggy shorts and black flip-flops over white socks, is considered a person of interest in the case and is not a suspect at this time**. Police are also requesting help with finding him.

It was 2006, I had just moved away to go to college.  I was living in the dorms and one night I received a phone call from my father asking why four FBI agents and a police liaison had showed up at their front door looking for me.  I thought my parents were kidding, apparently the FBI had one of my online usernames on a CD and would not tell my parents why they were looking for me since I was already of legal age.  The FBI told my parents they would be coming to visit me at school soon. I had no solid idea as to why I was being investiaged. Three LONG weeks passed and finally at 7AM I received a knock on my dormroom door.  It's an FBI agent and a school liaison, from there the FBI agent proceeds to question me in my dorm hallway with me in my boxers and kids from my hall walking by.

After a few minutes the agents start asking questions that indicate to me why I'm being investigated.  I ask the agent point blank what I'm being investigated for and am told until I'm indicted they don't have to reveal why they are investigating me or what for.  But they're questions hint at child pornography.  I was shown a picture of some girl and asked if I had ever seen her before, I hadn't.  They asked me if I had ever seen child porn before to which I replied not that I know of.  It went on for an hour or so, eventually they ask if they can take my computer to which I comply.  I had nothing to hide so I didn't mind them doing whatever they needed to do.  Only thing was I had two major assignments due within the next day or two that were already completed on the computer and the FBI wasn't going to let me email myself my projects.  One humorous moment I remember when the FBI came into my dorm to grab my electronics was that I had my hotbox vaporizer sitting right ontop of my laptop with the whip in the drawer below.  The FBI agent picks up the vaporizer, asks what it is to which I respond that it's a humidifier and change to subject asking if he needs my external back up too.

The FBI ended up taking my laptop and my external hard drive which interestingly and humorously enough was indeed filled with porn but all adult MILF porn like MyFriendsHotWife, MyFriendsHotMom, MyFriendsHotSister, MILFHunter, etc.

After taking my laptop the FBI then went door to door to all the other rooms on my hall asking them if they had ever seen or heard me watching child porn.  Needless to say I became rather infamous on my floor after being in school for only a month.

The FBI ended up subpoenaing my roommate infront of a federal grand jury where they asked him questions like if he had ever seen me with child porn, if he knew my password for my computer (which he did), and other similar questions.

My parents of course were freaked out and hired a federal attorney costing $10,000.

Eventually almost 9 or 10 months after everything began I got a call from my attorney notifying me the FBI was closing my case and I of course was not being charged.

It was a nerve-racking experience especially since I legitimately didn't have any idea what I could be investigated for or why I was in their target.  My only suspicion as to why they were investigating me was because four months before this happened I had been given an MIC at a party over Spring Break, I felt the way officer handled the situation terribly and I reported the police officer, filled out a report yadda yadda yadda.  Fast forward to summer and I start receiving calls from a detective who found a post I made on the internet about running from a party and began harassing me about it.  He would repeatedly call and try to scare me for what reason I'm not sure but eventually he even went so far as to call my girlfriends parents to tell them I was a drug dealer, a horrible person, and had inappropriate pictures of their daughter on my MySpace. That was the final straw, I called his lieutenant to report the detective.  His lieutenant was not terribly helpful but after that call the detective stopped calling me, then a month or so later the FBI is on my front door.

The only other thing I had ever done in my life which could semi-warrant an investigation were two fraudulent donation sites I made, one a ripoff of SaveToby and the other essentially telling people to donate money to me so I wouldn't have to work.  But neither of those would result in the investigation I was caught up in.",,False,,t5_2tayf,1367425476.0,,,True,t3_1dhi56,http://www.reddit.com/r/RBI/comments/1dhi56/was_investigated_by_the_fbi_in_2006_was_never/,

From his other photos I have gathered that he currently takes an economics class at the university in BA, has a yorkie that he plays with in Palermo, and might work at a phone repair shop. The BA police cannot help him until he can prove he owns the phone, and pays the bill (it is his work cell phone, they pay the bill). Being so far away I can only do so little, but I do want to try to help as much as possible. What do you think? I should also state I sent a couple more messages, but he never answered my previous inquiries, and never responded back. My husband went to his feed and also commented in spanish, also receiving no response.


EDIT: Turns out this kid is 12, I found him in the KIK messenger service (no idea that existed). He responded, saying that he doesn't understand me (language barrier) and that he turned the phone to the police. Awesome!

Basically, the situation is, someone (my suspicion is that it's the neighbor kid) keeps breaking into my parents garage, opening their car door--my mom often keeps it unlocked, and taking whatever cash is in the glove compartment. This has happened about 3-4 times in the past year, and happened again a few days ago.

They don't want to make a big fuss about it. They're older and have other things to worry about. 

Of course, they've changed the keypad for the garage door, and I've reminded them to keep the car doors locked. Usually, they're pretty good about this, but the weird/scary thing is that suppose they forget for one night, it'll happen. Like clockwork. This leads me to believe whoever is doing this slinking around frequently, if not every night. And that pisses me off.

I've looked into cameras and even firearms to try and stop the problem, but I guess I'm a little lost with regards to what the best way to spend my money would be. Obviously, if I could get a camera, we could nab the bastard if it happens again. What's are some such cameras worth spending money on? What are some other things I could do?

There was a guy I went to middle school, high school, and undergrad with.  We were very good friends and hung out pretty consistently for about 8 years.  I'll call him Pablo to avoid posting any personal info.  After we graduated, he said he was taking a year off and then going to law school at Columbia.  

A year goes by and he says he is going off to school, and for a semester we assume he is in New York attending Columbia law school.  Over winter break he and another mutual friend of ours (who we'll call Fred) came back to our hometown for a wedding.  After the wedding Fred and Pablo were supposed to meet back up in New York so that Fred could stay with Pablo while he was job hunting.    

So Fred arrives in NYC and calls up Pablo expecting to go meet up, but Pablo says he went to visit his parents before he flew back to NY, and his father was having some health trouble.  Furthermore, while visiting his father in the hospital Pablo was knocked over and suffered a concussion, so he was restricted from flying.  No worries, he was taking a train and would be in NYC the next day.  Fred finds another place to crash and then calls Pablo the next day, and Pablo has more bad news - his train is delayed due to inclement weather, but he should be in the next day.  So the next day Fred goes to meet Pablo at the train station, but Pablo calls with yet more bad news - he was robbed on the train and had to meet with the police.  He told Fred to just go about his business, and he'd catch up later.  

That was the last phone call anyone ever received from Pablo.  Fred texted Pablo after not hearing from him a day or two later and Pablo replied ""You're a good friend, I'll talk to you soon"" and that was the last communication we received from him altogether.  

His facebook is still active, but has not been touched.  His phone number still goes to his voice mail, but it is never answered.  I got his mother on the phone once about 6-8 months after this happened, and she said he was at the gym but would call back; nobody has answered the home phone # since.  I know his full name, birth date, parents names, and the name of the company where his mother works (though the company posts little to no contact info besides a generic help email).

Some other possibly relevant details:  I found an old article from a year or two after Pablo was born where a person with his father's exact name was convicted of kidnapping.   Pablo and his family spent approximately 6 years traveling the Caribbean on a boat right before we met.  His parents were constantly moving throughout the time we knew him; a new address every 8-12 months in the same city, and once Pablo graduated high school they started moving all over the state so I don't know where they may be located by now, but I'm semi sure of at least the city.

I feel like with the info I have I should be able to find some trace of him, but I can't find anything.  Does anybody have any suggestions?  ",,False,,t5_2tayf,False,,,True,t3_17c18v,http://www.reddit.com/r/RBI/comments/17c18v/trying_to_find_a_friend_who_vanished_can_you/,

My question is, can anyone help me identify which one/ones may be for a 2007 era macbook?

I only posted partials, as some of those definitely belong to friends/family. I think the first three sections should be enough to compare.

Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks.

TLDR; Robbed. Police report filed. Hoping to find mac address for stolen macbook.

EDIT: Its been a busy weekend worrying about weather or not we'll get anything back. I've made the rounds to the local pawn shops, checking kijiji religiously, etc. We did happen to call the Staples the macbook was originally purchased from 5 years ago, and after a really helpful employee going above and beyond to search through 5 years worth of receipts/POS records, we have found the serial number, and it has been added to the police report.

Tiny bit of backstory:
Some kids from a prior marriage came out of the woodwork recently and say he was into some bad stuff, and even talked about riding in the car with him late one night and stopping on a bridge. ""He walked around to the trunk and heaved a wrapped up body over his shoulder, walked over and dumped it into the river"" were their exact words. When they found out he was killed (unsolved, no leads whatsoever) they said ""that's not surprising, he was always trying to stay one step ahead of the guys that were after him"" which actually makes a lot of sense. I'd always wondered why he'd suddenly move us to a new area in the middle of the night. ""Wake up, we're going to the new house!"" at 3:30 am is weird. I can't stand the curiosity any longer.

For more context:

* Every bomb threat has been for our Chevron Building (mostly chemistry) or Cathedral of Learning (mostly arts and sciences, but i've heard of calc classes being taught in there) buildings (Cheveron has 2 and Cathedral has 5)
* All threats have been written on the stalls in bathrooms (all male restrooms except for a recent female restroom threat in Chevron)
* The stall doors have been removed from male bathrooms recently
* Whenever a threat happens a text and/or phone call is sent out to all students registered to the Emergency Notification Service (ENS) and all students are evacuated from the building.  The building does not re-open until it has been thoroughly checked (usually takes 2 hours)

Here are dates and times I received the ENS text for each bomb threat:

*   02/13/12 05:17PM Chevron Building - cleared at 6:18PM
*   03/14/12 11:03AM Cathedral of Learning - cleared at 12:47PM
*   03/19/12 10:40AM Cathedral of Learning - cleared at 12:32PM
*   03/22/12 09:47AM Cathedral of Learning - cleared at 11:39PM
*   03/28/12 10:06AM Chevron Building - cleared at 11:51PM
*   03/28/12 05:55PM Cathedral of Learning - cleared at 7:50PM
*   03/30/12 10:16AM Cathedral of Learning - cleared at 12:11PM

I am currently in a position where I can only investigate things in the afternoon, but I know people who could investigate things otherwise.  I would appreciate any assistance in putting an end to these bomb threats because they are disruptive to me and my peers, and the University as a whole.  Anyone who solves it on their own go ahead and try to get the reward.  If you have any advice about actions I can take, I will gladly hear them.  Thank you.

I bought it for just under $10,000 for 35k miles on it which was a fair price according to KBB. I am now in the process of trying to sell the car and when I went to check the KBB value again it won't give me the option of selecting a 4 cylinder GT. I check my paperwork and my loan and they all list GT. I put the VIN into google and come to find out, my car is actually a GS which is valued significantly less than the GT. I tried to contact the phone number on the website to find out why they sold me a GS under the pretense of a GT but the number belongs to a random woman now. I emailed the site through the contact form too. What else can I do? I was told LLC's have limited liability so if I sue I probably won't get anything back.

This guy was already previously pissed apparently because he started yelling various angry things out his window and kept repeating ""GET OUT OF THE WAY! I HAVE A FUCKING BABY IN THE CAR!"" -- he then got out of the car, came over and yelled at my fiance again.. My fiance looked up at him and simply said ""Do you need something?"" smiled ..and this really pissed the guy off because he reached in and punched my fiance in the face .. The light had turned green at this point (and if you don't know the turn, there are two turn lanes) he had enough space and could have easily pulled around us once he returned to his car.. but instead rushed back to his car and started yelling the same thing and blaring his horn.

It was at this point that I yelled at my fiance that he needed to get this guy's license plate but when he stepped out of the car and began dialing the police the man reversed at about 50mph into the gas station(Chevron) next to us rather recklessly and then skidded out in an attempt to avoid us catching his plate.. Police were phoned and arrived but unfortunately could not find a plate that matched the vehicle..

I have a partial plate but would this information hurt my case if we were to share it, and would it also hurt to offer a description best we can of the man? I would really appreciate some help on this..

This unfortunately has left my fiance with a gash that may need stitches in his left cheek.. Otherwise I would have just let it go. I wish I could have done more to help the situation but being 24 weeks pregnant I couldn't really run after the car to confirm the plate.. :/

Update: Wanted to thank gabbythefck for helping me out. It seems that the plate we had taken down is a fake and this guy will likely get off free unless someone happens to see him. I am just really glad someone was there to further help us out. If you happen to see or have info on a beige Nissan Pathfinder with the plate 089YZQ we'd appreciate it.

Detailed information and pictures inside.,V3L0CTY,34,8,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/RBI/comments/1jbras/can_rrbi_help_track_down_a_friends_stolen_car/,"Hey everybody. I was hoping you guys might be able to help a friend of mine recover a stolen vehicle.  It is a black 2006 Chevrolet Impala SS with light grey leather interior.  The car had around 106,700 miles on it.  The VIN number is 2G1WD58C169102912.  He had it listed on Craigslist and someone came to buy the car with a cashiers check.  The check turned out to be fraudulent.  The car was âsoldâ on Saturday (July 27) and my friend called the bank that supposedly issued the check this morning (Monday July, 29) only to find out that is was a fake.  The guy said he was from Birmingham, AL and he claimed to be buying the car for his daughter.   The number he called from was (678) 270-0693.  My friend has not called the guy because he doesn't want to alert the guy that he knows the check is fraudulent.  It is common for people to just cash the check and find out in a couple of weeks.  He was hoping by not calling he would buy some time to track the guy down.  The guy drove up in a new Red Wing edition Dodge Ram 1500 crew cab truck that was a metallic red color that looks very similar if not identical to the picture posted below, note the Detroit Red Wing logo on the rear bed of the truck.  He was middle age, possibly mid to late 40s.  He was African American with short hair and possibly balding.  He said his name was John.  He said he was going to title the car in his daughterâs name.  A police report has been filed but that doesnât seem like that is going to do much.  I have attached pictures of the check and pictures of the vehicle.  Note: the Police have the physical check, as it is evidence.  The bank requested a fax of the check and this is a picture of the copy of that fax.

Edit: Thanks for all the responses! He is still looking for it. Hopefully something will work out and the car will be found. He did manage to get the vin flagged as stolen. The police said they didn't know how to classify it at first. There was a debate between theft or financial fraud. They ended up classifying it as a stolen vehicle so at least there is that small victory.

Apparently someone picked it up and I guess they have no intention of returning it as of yet. I lost a loved one and there are pictures and video on this phone that cannot be replace and I hadn't downloaded yet.  
It is a black LG Optimus with slide out keyboard. Service is through straight talk. It is an android phone and I tried the plan B android app, but it isn't working.  
I tried calling the phone, a woman answered, i explained it was my phone and i am offering a no questions asked reward for it, but she hung up on me. I called back and a man answered, i again said i would give a reward, he asked how much and off the top of my head I said $50. The phone is 2 years old, a bit banged up and only costs $150-180 new. He also hung up and i tried calling back several times they never answered again.
Is there a way to track it when the plan B app fails? from what i have read, straight talk will not track a location or give me any info on call details. Also from what i have read, police would be unlikely to track it either.  
Is there a way to track it myself? I'm not sure if triangulating the signal would require hacking in to cell towers, etc... GPS was not on when it was lost.
 I would also imagine that the people currently in possession of it are sketchy about meeting for a reward for fear that I would bring the police, that is my best guess. Is there a way to get them to do the exchange anonymously? (If they will listen to me long enough to arrange it).

##Background Info

""I run a cash business where we collect cash payments for the sale of Disneyland tickets. On 10/09/12. Me and my business partner went on vacation returning 10/24/12. We left the company to our employees while we were gone. 

On 10/22/12 at approximately 8:00 a.m, employee **M** gave me a call and said he couldn't open our office door, as the door handle was smashed in. Once he was able to pry open the door with a screw driver, he found that everything was untouched in the office except than the safe was gone. The safe contained approximately $40,000 cash, and one diamond ring valued at around $600 (details below see: **diamond ring**). 


I know, we are retarded for having this much cash in our office, but it piled up while we were gone. [The safe](https://m.hayneedle.com/?event=product&amp;id=SEN090&amp;category_id=2418&amp;source=pla&amp;gclid=CMyPr8--8bQCFQf0nAodj0cAYA&amp;adtype=pla&amp;ci_sku=SEN090&amp;kw=&amp;ci_src=17588969) is approximately 30 pounds and small enough to carry out. The office is located in a medical building with many other offices. My business is conducted in one room located towards the back  that was broken into.
There are two doors that enter the building (both require a key to enter). The one door is in the back, and the other is the main entrance, but is observed by a neighboring buildings camera. Whoever entered, entered in the back door, as we saw no-one enter in through the main door. 


There is no suspicious persons or anything useful in this one camera, other than our one employee, **R**, leaving at 1:00 pm on 10/21/2012 empty handed. There are also no cameras with other coverage around the premises. There are cars shown on this camera entering and leaving the parking lot, but unfortunately none are too easily seen, and many cars drive into the parking lot over night, as with our business, you must drop tickets off after you are done using them in our 24 hour drop box. 

There is an alarm system in the building, but our land-lord didn't have the alarm active for 3 months (which we didn't know about), so we weren't able to look up what time is was deactivated (if any), etc. 

All doors were said to be locked before leaving the premises at 1:00 pm by employee **R** who worked on 10/21/2012. 



---

##Suspects

Here is a list of employees/ partners of the business with a brief description. Everyone listed below has access to both a key to get into the main building, as well as our personal office door. Also note, there is a doctor currently also working in the building who has employees that have access to our building, but not our office. If anyone need any extra information, please let me know.

* **R**- Female in her 30s. Used to be in the military. Slow girl, but seemingly honest and seemed to always mean well. She would mess up some ticket purchases, but never was caught stealing money or skimming from the top. Worked 10/20 and 10/21 the days right before the safe was stolen. Was getting a ride to work from a friend because her car broke down. Has told us many times she needs money and offered to work more days after the incident. After the incident would still get rides to work, but then took off all of December due to a vacation she was going to take to Chicago. I spoke with her recently and she said she has post traumatic stress syndrome and has been sent to San Francisco to get rehab, and she didn't make it to Chicago, but can't come back to work. I sent her an e-mail, and upon reply will be able to see if IP address matches for San Francisco. Her story stayed the same that she didn't have money, and she never seemed to get her car fixed from when she would come to work.

* **M**- Male  in his 20s. He is a senior in college, and is studying business I believe. He is a very nice kid, a huge churchgoer and still lives with his parents in Orange County. He said he would take a polygraph if we needed him to. He gave his two weeks before we went on the trip 10/09, and his last day was 10/24 when we got back to the trip.

* **B** and  **V**- Males in their 30s. We found **V** to help out with our projects through Craigslist, and he asked us to bring his ""brother"" in to help out as well, and said they would split everything. These two were let go about 2 weeks before the incident occurred, due to a slow down at the office (no hard feelings were seemed to be felt). The two came in on the Friday before the robbery (10/19)  to pick up their last paycheck. and were seen walking around the office in areas they did not need to go. We share office space with a med center and one of there employees noticed them in the front while my business is only in the back area.  Both are ex-military members. **V** has a family and wife, and has always been respectful. **B** had tendencies to not show up to work on certain days, and his brother would always apologize. **B** and **V** would sometimes ""forget"" to give back certain change amounting to no more than $10 when going out for errands, etc. **B** always had excuses when he didn't come in to work. **B** has told me that he doesnât have a job and sells weed as his main income and that his friend grows it outdoors. 

---

##Aftermath

Based on the above info, we thought **B** to be the most likely suspect, without even telling his brother what he did. We had a Private Investigator look into him, and saw him and his brother driving around in seemingly new vehicles. Our PI confronted **V** at his house, and the detective was told the cars were used to help them move packages from their old apartment to a new one. The one was a friends and the other was **V**'s wife new car. When **V** was asked by the PI if he though **B** did it, he said he wasn't sure. The wife seemed upset at this time, saying **B** has gotten them into trouble before. I had the private investigator look into **B**s bank accounts, and he found $300 in one account, and a negative balance in the other. It seems **B** is still living with **V** and **V**âs wife at the new apartment they moved in to, but this is not confirmed.

When **B** was asked by the police detective to come in for questioning, he referred the detective to his lawyer. The lawyer then called the detective and said **B** would not be coming in for questioning. 


At this point, the detective has said there is nothing else he can do if **B** doesn't want to come in for questioning. (By the way they didn't even look for fingerprints or anything at the premises, said it wouldn't have helped). The private eye is too expensive, and the detective has already told **V** there was a private eye following **B**, so following will probably lead to little if anything. 

Other than suing the landlord for negligence in not paying the alarm company, the Reddit community is the only way I think there is a possibility of getting the money and/or ring back somehow. I thank you for ANY help you can put in, and the intelligence of this community. Some of this money was to be applied to already purchased inventory, and now I am in debt. 


###I am willing to donate 10% of the amount found to anything the Reddit community wants, if we can find this safe and/or ring.

I'm told they must have access to her Icloud in order to do that. They've sent personal conversations to her BF, as well as violent threats, while insinuating that they are me. 

I need to catch the person. There are 3 suspects. 

The boyfriend deleted all the messages, despite her asking him to send them to her (she read them on his ipad, and verified to me they were in fact real messages she and I had sent-- nothing illicit, but they were taken out of context and used to harass and torment her boyfriend). 

The boyfriend is a suspect. So is her exhusband, who has sent hate mail to her boyfriend and his family in the past, and also stalked her car rental account (cuz it was her old password). Another suspect is her 20 year old son (who doesn't like the boyfriend and wishes his mom and I were together).... we aren't romantic like that though, just the dearest friends 

It's pretty obviously the creepy exhusband... (divorced for 3 years, she gave him both their houses in the divorce and just wanted to get away from him forever, and he dogs her like a total creep who should be locked up). 

SO-- I don't have the gmail address. All that I know is the name that showed up on the gmail account is 'You Know Who'. 

I searched google plus and found only two names that match on the entire gmail network-- how do I find out the IP of the person responsible for this? I need to catch whoever it is... I need definitive proof. 

How do I do this?

My parents were born in the Philippines and immigrated here in the 1970s.  I was born here.  We are all citizens of the US.  They are in the process of obtaining dual citizenship.

About 6 month ago, my parents informed me that they had been talking with an individual back in the Philippines.  They said that this woman was the girlfriend of some immediate family back in the Philippines.  Let's call her Sarah.

Sarah tells them of some amazing investment opportunities in the Philippines.  Specifically, she tells them of some farmland that could be purchased for a very low price- something about ""the landowners are in debt and want to put up the land as collateral for a loan.""  My parents agree to loan them money.  The landowners eventually default on the loan, and my parents now own the property. 

The story quickly becomes much more complicated.  Additional investment properties are offered up in place of payments.  My parents' ""property holdings"" grow.  Presently, my parents have gotten roped into ""purchasing more property,"" some of which are supposedly apartment buildings, and ""collecting rent"" from those apartments.  However, no money was ever materialized.  Sarah repeatedly tells stories of ""the money was deposited and should be in your account,"" ""there was a death in the family and this transfer was delayed,"" ""I will get to the bottom of this,"" etc.

However, it has been revealed that all but one of the ""land titles"" that my parents hold are forgeries.  My aunt who also got roped into this scam flew to the Philippines and tried to sort things out.  Sarah avoided her the whole time she was there, and my aunt came back without any answers.

My parents are obviously stressed and embarrassed by this whole situation.  When asked how much they've sunk in to this disaster, they dodge the question.  I estimate their involvement is in the tens of thousands of American dollars, at least.  They trusted Sarah as family and I doubt there are any written contracts.

When pressed on the issue, they admit that they have no plan, and that they're ""waiting and seeing.""  They feel that there's no one to turn to.

Where should we turn?  Is there a government entity that we should involve, since there are forgeries of titles involved?  Any specific international agencies I should look into?

I recently got wind of  a missing person from my collegiate Alma Mater, and everyone has been stymied in finding her. Any help would be great, [here is a link to the public facebook page.](https://www.facebook.com/groups/emileeirsik/?ref=ts&amp;fref=ts)

The original post about her disappearance is below:

&gt;
Help us find Emilee Irsik! On October 19, Emilee flew on American Airlines from Wichita, KS to Dallas, TX and then to London Heathrow Airport. She then flew on British Airways to Hamburg, Germany arriving on October 20. She was to return to Wichita on October 26. Unfortunately, Emilee did not board her scheduled return flight and she has not rebooked on a later flight. Her cell phone has been off since she departed Dallas, TX on the 19th, and all attempts to contact her via email, Facebook, etc. have failed. It is possible that she visited Trier University, University of Hanover, or Bielefeld University in Germany. She has been listed as a Missing Person
with the NCIC registry. The American Citizenâs Service Unit of the US Embassy in Berlin has notified the police in Hamburg that she is missing and her family is concerned about her welfare. The police in Hamburg have in-turn notified other police departments across Germany. There is also information regarding Emilee on German radio. If Emilee spoke to you regarding this trip, has made contact with you, or you have any information that may prove beneficial, please contact local law enforcement or the US Department of State at (202) 647-4000 and ask to be transferred to the Duty Officer in Berlin. If you are overseas, please contact the German police or contact the local US Embassy. Please âshareâ this group with your friends, and anyone you know in Germany or may have contacts in Germany. As her family, we are extremely concerned about her welfare and just want to bring her home. Please join us in praying for her safe return. Please send all media requests to this page and you will be contacted by Emiliee's family as soon as possible.

Once again, any help would be great! Thanks!

So that happened for a few years, no contracts were signed or anything. Now fast forward to not too long ago. The web designer who had been maintaining the website for a long time suddenly decides to have a fare hike. To which my relative declined to continue the services further. At this point, the designer supposedly pledged revenge on my relative saying that ""he will pay.""

So my relative never had ownership of the hosting or the domain name (which is my relative's fault, in my opinion).

So what has the designer done? The designer started putting up lots of Google Ads. Meanwhile, they changed some of the information such as the phone number, address, menu items, and certifications.

So my question to RBI (not sure if this would be the best subreddit since it's not exactly a crime, just slightly unethical) is what should I do (or suggest to my relative to do)? I was thinking of possibly complaining to the web host (GoDaddy **shudder**) that there may be things that are copyrighted or something like that. Or writing something to the better business bureau?

In pursuit of a better job, I had to sacrifice and move to a fairly shady part of Boston. Better rent, cool room mates, a place that was in fact nicer than my old place, but the area around us was fairly shady.

We live pretty much across the street from a corner store and it's no chore to walk there and back. Yesterday, I left the house (Unlocked even though I was the only one home) and went to the store to get some Arizona (A-Palms for life). When I got back I found stuff missing my from my room (Closest room to the front door). The list of missing shit:

* Droid (Plan B didn't work worth shit and Verizon is basically laughing at me because I installed CM7.)
* Guitar in hard, unmarked guitar case.
* Desktop computer (With all of the music I've written over the last 10 or so years).
* Laptop (Gaming-grade laptop with all of my accounts set to log in automatically) Side note: I have a BIOS password on it and Prey installed, but I'll tell you why that shit didn't work out for me in a minute.
* Nikon D700 + about $3000 of lenses + a couple years worth of photos.
* External hard drive

I'm lucky enough that they didn't try to take my 42"" monitor, but that would've been hard to run with I assume.

It wasn't a smash-and-grab job, but rather a ""we saw you leaving your house dark and walked in the front door"" job. I called the cops immediately using the phone at the corner store and they weren't even a little sympathetic. They tell me they can't do much because they didn't steal my gun and they didn't break anything. I asked if they could fingerprint and they said no. Yay. The neighbors were less than helpful (The ones who spoke English, anyway). I now have nothing. My roomie is nice enough to let me use his netbook until I can save up to buy all that shit back (Not going to happen any time soon).

What hurts pretty badly is that my Facebook, Soundcloud, deviantArt, Steam, Gmail and original Reddit account have since been hijacked. Google is being really, REALLY slow to help me. Like... One canned response. They're probably not going to be able to in at least a couple days because of my phone situation. Valve can't help because my Gmail is unrecoverable. Same with deviantArt and same with Facebook.

My girlfriend called my room mate wondering what the deal is with my Facebook which has been horrifically defaced. Friends messaged, my girlfriend's ""pictures"" distributed to a large portion of them.

My life is on fire and I have nothing. And to think, I was buying some Arizona so I could have a nice all-nighter of Skyrim with all my new mods.

Don't fuck up like I did. Don't.

EDIT: In my frustration, I forgot to add why Prey and my BIOS password isn't working. The photos of my girlfriend were on that laptop. I figure they reset BIOS with a battery pull or something.

My mom works as a real estate agent in Caracas, Venezuela. A couple of days ago she got an email from someone who claims to be a vascular surgeon from California under the name of Dan Newton.

Everything seems a bit fishy to me, mainly because of 3 things

1. I don't know why a californian surgeon would ever want an appartment in Caracas. My dad says there are some surgeons from overseas that come and work here because they apparentlypay less taxes in Venezuela, but I don't think that's enough evidence for me to be sure everything is in check.

2. I read the e-mail he sent to my mom and it looks like the guy doesn't even know how to write in his own language. 

3. The guy says he specializes in vascular surgery, yet I still can't find anything about him on the internet.


Here's a textual copy of the email sent to my mother. I didn't post his full adress because I don't know if I am allowed, just the type of adress he is using. I will however, give them via PM to anyone who can help.

''Hello, I am Doctor Dan a surgeon from California, US. I saw your house listing for sale on Coldwellbanker site which I am interested in, Please get back to me on my personal email address so we can make neccesary arrangement for viewing and payment. -------@gmail.com Regards, Dan Newton, M.D. Specialty: Vascular Surgery ------@gmail.com -------@aol.com''


If anyonce can help me prove is this guy is real or not, me and my family would greatly appreciate it. Venezuela is a country where everything can happen unnoticed and I just want to avoid having a parent run into serious trouble or an unpleasent situation. I already told her to excercise some caution should anything else happen.

This particular year was rough for my dad- his oldest daughter was a middle schooler, his wife was pregnant, and his already disabled 8-year-old son acquired a virus that was determined to be airborne.  It left him blind in one eye (&lt;15% vision in that eye until corrective surgery in 2004) and damaged sight slightly in the other.

No one remembers the name of the virus.  My half-sister was 12, I don't expect her to remember.  My mom was pregnant with me, and my older siblings aren't her kids, so she doesn't remember.  My dad, as I said, was having a rough year due to those life stressors.  He ""doesn't want to bother"" contacting his ex-wife to find out the name of it strictly because I'm curious.  I don't really want to either, because I've met her twice in my life and it would be weird.  My half-brother is mentally and physically disabled, and knows about as much as he does about his health conditions as he does about calculus.

Any medical professionals of Reddit know what this could be?  I feel like conjunctivitis and herpes would've been simple enough to remember, so I'm guessing it was neither of those.  Plus, my family always seems to tack on ""rare airborne disease"" when talking about my brother's blindness, which also leads to my tentative conclusion that it is not conjunctivitis or herpes.

I have a little update. The FOIA request is still processing. Something very strange happened to me this morning. I was emailing few family members regarding the case when I went to my desktop to attach a few files from the folder I made specifically for my Grandpa's disappearance. I left it on my desktop, in plain view, to remind myself to keep my search going.

Well, the folder wasn't there anymore. I thought maybe I misplaced it... I searched for it both manually and automatically. I tried every word I could think of that was in the file names, NOTHING. ZERO. It's like the folder never existed. Even tried to do the file recovery. NADA. It somehow got wiped off my computer and I'm PISSED. 

I don't know if it was intentional or I was really a dumbass, but I'm pretty sure I would have known it if I deleted the entire folder full of articles, photographs, etc. I just feel completely invaded... I'm also puzzled, why would someone do this? I didn't think it was that important to go onto my computer and just delete it? There was no bombshell in there. Just same ol' information. 

Is it a threat? A warning of some kind? It's giving me even more reason to get into this deeper... I still have some of the folder's contents stored elsewhere so I'm okay. But dayum, I should have backed up the whole folder onto a flashdrive or something. Any ideas of what I should do next? :/ I'm trying not to get paranoid, but wtf I can't believe that this happened to me. Something is DEFINITELY going on and I'm kinda in a freak out mode now.

This day, 2 years ago, my life was completely flipped upside down when the girl I had been e-dating for a year+ turned out to be a guy all along. Upon finding out, he completely disappeared and I haven't seen him since. Since then, I have been plagued with numerous questions about the entire ordeal and could seriously benefit from some closure from the entire event. In addition to this, it would also mean a lot to me, as I'm sure it would others, if I could make sure this never happens to anyone else, as maybe she has other victims. In addition to this, I'm sure the girl he's pretending to be wouldn't be too thrilled about him posting her picture around. 

* So here's the information I know about him. The name he went by was Regina. He has an account on D2Jsp forums called RvBFan, and was a massive fan of Red Vs. Blue. He played many games, including Diablo 2, Starcraft and CoD Black Ops 2. He was an avid fan of football. He claimed to live in Houghton, Michigan. He'd always used proper grammar/punctuation when talking. He's 24. He's very tech saavy and is going to be making a living doing things with computers.
* Last of all, this is the girl he posed as: http://i.imgur.com/YA3bKY9.jpg

* I realize this probably seems pathetic, but it seriously messed me up something pretty awful. I don't want anyone to ever go through what I did when this shit happened.

When they arrived, they were down to 4% battery life and eventually went down to 1% and then dead.  A few minutes later it was turned on.  It is now moving(???) around the flea market while charging....

My husband is on his way up to the flea market right now...  how should we proceed?  I assume they are trying to find someone to wipe the phone out...  If they do, will ""Find My iPhone"" continue to work???

**EDIT:**

**Why does my son have an iPhone?** My son's father is a verbally abusive tool. When my son turned 5 I got a Firefly (kid's phone) to maintain direct contact while he was with his Dad. Fast forward a few years and I dropped my iPhone 4 in the toilet the night before the 4S release. Bought the 4S the next day. The phone randomly came back to life a week later and passed it along to my son considering the fact he had gone years without breaking or losing his cheap kiddie phone.  His understanding has always been that he's ""borrowing"" it and it will be repossessed without notice if me or my husband need it.

**Retrieval:**  The phone lost signal right as my husband was arriving.  When he got there, my husband called the cops.  He used the last dot on the map and began looking in that area.  He found a Cricket wireless table and asked the guy if he could unlock and activate an iPhone.  The guy confirmed that he could.  My husband then asked if he received an iPhone within the past hour that had a broken back screen.  The guy pulled out a ticket with a woman's phone number and first name.  He said she was supposed to come back the following day at 8:30 a.m.  The guy was somewhat helpful but wasn't excited about turning over the phone.  Per the Mexican Cricket guy, ""the senorita is with a very large black man, what if they kill me""?  The police arrived, my husband had to provide various methods of proof to get the phone back.  The police officer called the woman and she swears she just found it and didn't know (which is bullshit, I sent messages to the phone via Find My iPhone).  Oh well, she paid $110 already and we have the phone back.  Plus I called her from an offsite, private, blocked number and explained to her what a cunt (a word I have only used twice in my life) she is and society would appreciate her finding a job to pay her bills as opposed to stealing from a child.

Lisa Holst of ""PC Professional"" wrote an article making outrageous claims in order to prove that people on the internet believe anything.

&gt; Problem is, however, Lisa Holst, ""PC Professional"", and the people-are-so-gullible article all apparently do not exist.

&gt; Now it could well be that the story of ""it was a story made up by Lisa Holst"" could very well itself be made up. (Yo dog!) I know it is hard to prove a negative, but if there is any way of proving that Lisa Holst does NOT exist, that I think would solve the mystery as well.

OKC",meowmeowman,19,1,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/RBI/comments/1cmyuj/my_nexus_4_was_stolen_and_i_have_his_phone_number/,"Hey guys.  I live in central OKC, and yesterday my Nexus 4 was stolen.  I was selling it on Craigslist.  The man met me in front of my house, I let him look at it while he was in his car, and he sped off.  I know it was foolish, but he seemed fairly trustworthy and like he knew what he was doing.  Either way, it was stolen.  He was a tall, white, thin man who was bald.  Late 30s, probably.  He had a shorter, plump friend with him, with dark brown hair.  
More sleuthing led me to find that this guy has been at this for a while.  Running his phone number on Craigslist showed me multiple listings of phones that he was selling.  I've texted him from a different number offering to buy one of these phones as a sort of trap to find out where he lives, but he's sold all of them at the moment.  
What I know for sure:


- The Man's appearance.


- I have the serial number and IMEI of my Nexus 4.  It has no personal information or pictures on it and I did a factory reset, so Plan B won't work.


- The car he drives.  It was a bumble bee yellow Pontiac Sunfire.  I have his license plate number.  If anyone has some kind of way to associate an address with it, it'd be much appreciated.  

- As I mentioned in the last bullet, his plate numbers.

- I have his cell phone number.  He's been using this number since at least October.  He is on T-Mobile and using an unlocked iPhone 3G or 3GS (at least, he was when I saw him).

- His Significant Other's phone number.  It was a second number listed on one of his ads.  

- His S/O's name.  She had a voicemail, he did not.  Her name is Danna, or Daina or something like that.  I don't know if that's how you spell it.   

- This is *not* his first time doing this.  He has multiple phone listings on craigslist, although all of them have been sold.  

That's essentially all I know about the guy.  Ideas I've had include setting up a few fake phone ads and seeing if he bites on any of them, or waiting for him to list a new ad and then offering to buy it.  The police came to my house around 15 minutes after he left, and we gave them all of the information we have.  Is there anything left to do that I haven't already done?  The phone had insurance on it, and T-Mobile is sending me a new one, but I'd like to stop this guy and get my phone back.  I can supply more explicit details via PM.  Let's catch this motherfucker.

Ask me something, maybe I forgot to list it.

I am sorry if this is not really the right place for this, it seems kind of paltry next to all the other posts here. If you know of a better place to ask about this, I would be happy to delete this post and ask there instead.

For a while now (probably 2 months or so) I have been getting emails daily with the heading ""Delivery Status Notification (Failure)"". Around 100 or more a day. I also get the occasional email from businesses with automated ""we are out of the office"" responses.

It seems as though some spammers are spoofing my email address, so I get all the bounced mail. My junk mail seems to have increased too, but that may be people trying to get back at the spammers by posting my email address around thinking I am the cause. 

Luckily I am on an unlimited bandwidth plan for my broadband, so I am not using up a limit by receiving these emails.

I tried looking up the issue online, but the only advice I could find is to give up my email address and move on. The problem is this email address is tied into my broadband account, and I've had it for 13+ years. The company doesn't even use this format any more because it changed names a few years ago. Everyone who knows me contacts me through this email address, and I use it for lots of forums, websites etc.

The other problem with this email being tied to my account is that the ISP has an online email inbox (think Hotmail or Gmail), so even if I stop checking mail for that email address it's still piling up, and questions may eventually get asked.

So my question is this: Is there any way I can stop this from happening?

A friend just clued me in to reddit after NO help from the state department and police department. My brother Steve served in the US military as an Army Ranger and returned as a private contractor this year, to work on a base in Kabul that has about 300 employees. All these guys are American for the most part, and most of them are cops or ex-military. He says all the cops are assholes and have a sort of ""good ol boys"" club there. Not surprising (ha). He came home mid-Dec. for a month's break and hung out with me in San Francisco for a few weeks. When he got back to Kabul, his laptop was missing from his room. All his private info was on there-- scanned copies of birth certificate, SSN card, credit card info, access to FB, gmail, linkedin, etc.

No one will do anything to help him. Although this private company is under the state department, apparently they've told him they have decided not to investigate. They won't even tell him who went on leave while he was gone-- because whoever stole the computer brought it back to the states with them, and if he had a list of names, he could possibly figure out who it was. Somehow he's been able to track down his facebook IP addresses, and there were three he doesn't recognize, from Texas. He hasn't been in Texas lately, that's for sure. He has the IP addresses and the time accessed.  He's been texting all this info to me from his phone and asked me to call a PI to see if anyone can help. He called police departments in Texas and they said they can't do anything either. I called a PI today, and they told me they need a subpoena to get any information. If he could just find out the name of the person who did this, he would be able to track that person down from the small pool of people who work at this base and hopefully find out what was done with his computer. Like I said, we're talking about a community of 300 employees. He's so worried his personal info is going to be used somehow.

Hope someone out there can help me.... I'm not the most computer savvy so please keep that in mind with the computer lingo you send my way. I will absolutely send you the IP addresses and info he gave me, I would post it here but it says I'm not allowed to and I don't want to break any rules.

Thanks! 
Maree

Ten months later, my twin brother, Coty, was murdered in his apartment. Nothing was stolen from either crime scene. Despite a $200,000 reward for Gelareh's case (the largest ever offered by Crime Stoppers) no arrests have been made. My family and I believe both murders are connected. We are seeking to generate attention on both cases beyond Houston in hopes that anyone with information will come forward. On April 5th, 2013, Channel 2 KPRC Houston interviewed my mother and I and the segment aired April 25th. The investigative reporter identifies Coty's father-in-law as the likely link between both cases. Here is the complete story: http://www.click2houston.com/news/local-2-investigates-uncovers-new-clues-in-unsolved-mysteries/-/1735978/19898912/-/143cax9/-/index.html

A few months before Coty was murdered, I told Gelareh's mother, ""I don't understand why people aren't giving more attention to this case. The murder appears to be professional and the killer is still out there. What if this happens again and destroys another family?"" I didn't know a few months later my family would be the next victims.

Almost 6 months after Coty's death, there are still items being tested at the crime lab. I didn't try to push for results when Gelareh was murdered because I assumed the police would handle the investigation and the killer be brought to justice. It's unsettling that the murderer(s) are able to work faster than our justice system. Never having experienced something like this, I am not familiar with options available to help expedite the process and protect my family. We are open to suggestions.

Coty frequently visted a current events/consipary forum called AboveTopSecret. He mentioned many times on this forum that he feared for both his and his wife's safety. More information about our family's experiences prior to Coty's murder can be found on the ATS site at: http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread943037/pg1

Justice for Gelareh and Coty is long overdue.

Pictures and a VERY long story inside...,geeeenie,19,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/RBI/comments/18mcv4/friends_cat_stolen_many_months_ago_please_help/,"[Pictures of Sassy, who was once featured as a ""Cat of Instagram.""](http://inst.ag/u/sassycat1/)
(Yes, I know Reddit doesn't like Instagram. Sorry.)

Hi all. I know my chances are slim, but my friend (I'll refer to her as K, as her name starts with a... K) misses her cat desperately, and I want to reunite them so badly. I'll start at the VERY beginning... 

K was very sick in high school. Her mother got her a little kitten whose health was also very poor as a way of making her feel more ""in control."" K had to take care of this kitty, Sassy, and nurse it back to health -- she would give Sassy her medicine and food before taking her own medicine and food. 

Well, fast forward some years. In August of 2012, K's parents moved into a condominium for a short-term stay as they were waiting for another housing situation to go through. At this point, K was out of the country. Anyway, they ate dinner outdoors every single night so they could let Sassy, an indoor cat, play outside supervised for a short time. Sassy didn't always go outside, though; they just liked making it an option for her for an hour or two every night. 

One night, they returned inside after dinner and found that Sassy was gone. They immediately suspected a family who lived in the same condominiums, whose little girl would go up to them almost every night when they had dinner and would say things like ""Your cat is so cute. I want your cat so badly. Can I have your cat?"" etc., etc. But there are about 200 condos in this complex and they had no idea where to look. Cats are easy to conceal. 

So it seemed like all hope was lost, until a couple months later. In October, [this picture](http://inst.ag/u/sassycat1/p/QxUZUWyT6K/) was found on Facebook by K's sister. As you can see, Sassy has a VERY distinct appearance. In addition, they recognized the tiling and the bar stool as the ones in every single condo in the complex in which Sassy was stolen. 

However, here's where the dead end is reached. K managed to find the phone number and email of the person who posted this photo (this person does not live in these condos, so we don't believe it was her who stole Sassy). K called this person numerous times and literally *begged* her to please, please, please say who stole the cat. K's mother even offered her $3000, as the cat was worth $2000 and the extra $1000 would just be a bonus. In response, the girl who posted the picture said ""I'm sorry, I really am, but I can't tell you, because that would mean ratting out my best friend."" Such bullshit.

Anyway, here's where you come in. If you've seen Sassy, please let me know if you have any information. K's parents no longer live in those condominiums, but every time K drives home, she stops by the condos and walks around, looking for Sassy and asking people if they've seen Sassy. 

We don't know much about the family that stole Sassy, but here's what we do know:

â¢African-American.
â¢Somewhere in Rancho Cucamonga, CA.
â¢The ""best friend"" mentioned before goes to Etiwanda High School.

I'm cautiously optimistic about it. It is crowdsourcing of crime solving. Very cool concept.

That said, I think it should operate under heavy moderation and take heavy note of how /r/askscience is run.

My initial suggestions:

  * Only self posts.
  * Only serious comments that directly relate to solving the crime. No jokes. No unrelated chit chat. Offending comments should be ruthlessly deleted by mods similar to /r/askscience. This is to prevent good info from being buried beneath a pile of irrelevance.
  * Any personal anecdotes must be highly relevant and only used to give context to information or suggestions that you share. Only report the essential facts and do not use this subreddit to practice your literary skills.
  * If enough people join, we should implement the identification of professional status similar to how askscience does it, so that we'll know that a commenter is a lawyer, police officer, PI, etc.
  * Posts that celebrate the successful conclusion of a case can be unmodderated free-for-alls.

They're in it deep ($10-45k US, they haven't been straight about the amount) and after having tried to convince them that it's a ponzi scheme they're still committed to it as a real investment scheme. One of them has even quit his job to pursue this ""investment"" full time and has been bombarding everyone he knows to join this thing. Definitely brainwashed.

I've taken it upon myself to decide to get these people arrested as I now know they've been scamming loads of people in the same county I live in. 

I've decided to set up a meeting with them so that they can give me their sales pitch, record it, and get any other viable information I can get to give to the authorities so that they end up in jail and my in-laws don't waste any more of their time on this obvious scam. Then the civil suits can begin.

The details of the scam go something like this:

Invest at a low rate (2-3k) to begin with and receive a slow monthly payout over the next 3 years. 
OR
Invest at a high rate (~15k) and then recruit 3 more people through 3 levels [branching out to a maximum of 3+9+27 people] to receive a large monthly payout over the next 3 years totaling $100k or more.

What I need: 

* Questions to ask during their sales pitch to expose them.
* Ideas on what evidence the police would need to consider this a viable arrest.
* Tips on hiding a camera/microphone.

After justice has hopefully been served I will submit relevant news articles, pictures, and the original hidden cam video exposing the scheme to justiceporn.

We tried calling the police, who couldn't find it in their system. I'm fairly certain it was a New York license plate (with the dark yellow and blue color scheme) And using lookup online doesn't bring anything, even after trying every state.

My 13"" 2011 MacBook Air, my North Face backpack that housed it, SONY noise-canceling headphones, and my North Face winter jacket were stolen.

Local police came to file a report, take fingerprints, etc. but didn't get much.  There was a full dirty handprint on my center console but we were told they do not get ""good prints"" off of leather.

A detective that is working the case took some serial numbers.  He mentioned a nationwide pawn shop database that they submit the information to for a match.  Other than that, they are going to interview some of my neighbors as part of the investigation.  The detective feels that the criminal is someone who knows me or what I keep in my house/car.  I can't even begin to believe that someone I know would do this to me.  I am very generous and love to host friends for parties often.

I used iCloud to remotely wipe my MacBook Air and lock my iPhone 4S but I can not locate them anymore.

Any other tips?  Am I missing something?  Is this a lost cause?

I remember sharing the back seat of my college roommate's buick regal with it for forever, that red cover staring me in the face, but it never enticed me enough to ask to borrow it. Today, though, I needed something new to read, and I figured now was as good a time as ever.

There were several copies on the shelf, and I grabbed the one that looked the most beat to shit - this book store prices their books by condition, so getting one that's a little rough around the edges gives you a good chance to save a few bucks. i opened it to the page where this store normally lists their prices - those first few blank pages - and was confronted by a note left by a previous owner to her dead sister.

i read through it quickly and the only words i could muster were 'what the fuck.' i showed my friend and she was just as perturbed by it. i could have easily just put it back and gotten a different copy of the same book, but something about it refused to let that happen. i bought it and the lady at the front desk skimmed right over the notes (one in the front, one in the back) and didn't notice a thing. the book has been in my possession ever since and it's creeping me the fuck out.

**TL;DR - found a book with a note from a girl to her dead sister, some sort of angsty poem too. afraid someone is going to crawl out of my television and kill me.**

i've included images of the book and the notes here, and the text transcripts of those notes in the comments as well.

[Note to her sister](http://imgur.com/alGQL)

[Poem? Suicide Note?](http://imgur.com/vrt4z)




**Some clues -** 

Presumably the author's name is Theresa - in the bottom right of the first page, she signs it Theresa and what LOOKS LIKE the last name BLY or BELL. 

The note is clearly written to someone named VALERIE, whose death anniversary is coming up at the time this was all written. 

In the note the author feels the need to clarify what LOL means - the book is copyrighted 2003, so did her sister die before the internet became popular?

In the beginning she writes a little side note that says ONCE A JOHNSON, ALWAYS A JOHNSON. 

Their mother is either dead or out of the picture.

 We bought a house a few years ago in a quiet neighborhood. Fenced backyard with a gate on the side of the house. Several months later, I open my sliding glass door to find an empty mousetrap beneath the step.

I assumed that one of my cats raided it, took the booty and left behind the evidence. 

I grabbed a spoon to make sure it wasn't ""loaded"" before I disposed of it and much to my surprise, it snapped shut. Scared the living shit out of me.

So now I have a mystery. The only logical conclusion being that someone went through my gate, down the walkway, past my windows, past a motion censor light and put it there...ARMED!!!

 But who and why? Neighborhood kids? Cat haters? Seems like a shitload of trouble to go through to mess with us. It would be easier to put it out front.

Maybe one of my cats is a ninja. Who knows. But I don't even think the best ninja puss could drag a loaded trap here without setting it off.

We are a reserved, normal couple. We don't cause any trouble and keep to ourselves. The house on the right is empty. The old folks on the left were and are kind, welcoming people. We have never had issues with anyone.

We only have a handful of friends, most of whom live out of town. It just makes no sense.

After seeing some of the shit you guys solve, I figured if anyone could figure this out you could.

This friend didn't have a computer so I tried my best to recover her email from my computer with her permission to use her credentials to try and recover them. They were wiped pretty well out though and so she said she had called AOL and that they said they could still recover them if they had been deleted in less than 24 hours (which lined up with AOL support documentation almost). 

She gave me the number and I conferenced that number in and we got ""Raj with AOL tech support"". He would only talk to my friend and when I said that I was just there as local tech support for her and she was ok with me being there he promptly hung up on us. This seemed weird but I decided to see where it would go if they just talked with her while I stayed on mute.

After I called them back with her and stayed on mute they asked for a call back number, my friend gave my number, and they called me back. I added them to the conference I had with my friend and they began walking who they thought was her through allowing them remote access, instead they were remoting into my computer with logmein123.com.

They had her/me login to her AOL account, where they did nothing but look at the screen. they then opened up my prefetch files and system information saying that I had prefetch files corrupted by a virus and it was affecting some drivers that were shut off.

At this point I laughed to myself recognizing the standard fake AV scare scam, pulled my network cable and re-imaged my computer out of my sheer paranoia.

I suspect my iPhone is stolen and about to be wiped. It was turned off shortly after I hit the play sound button on Find my Phone App on iCloud. This was 30 minutes 

Anyways this is what I did so far:

* I locked the iPhone with a message on the iCloud Find my Phone App

* I reported it as lost through my Canadian carrier (Fido)

* I will be contacting the non emergency police department tomorrow as their office for is closed


**From my understanding**


If the thief wipes it, I just lose all my data on the iPhone.


If I lock it via Find my Phone App, I get an additional pass lock on top of my usual lock. Also my message ""Lost phone: Monetary reward if found. Call xxx-xxx-xxxx.


From my conversation with the rep at Apple Canada's 1800 number, Apple can't block or lock it. So the IMEI block is done through my carrier (Fido)? Maybe they don't do an IMEI block because I read somewhere that Rogers (another Canadian carrier) does a sim card block.


**Concerns**

What happens if I don't block my IMEI? Is there a greater chance of identity theft if I do not block this?

From the above site, someone suggested that it is better to not block the IMEI just yet. Wait a few weeks until the phone is sold to another person. Then block it. That way, the new owner is forced to contact their carrier (FIDO assuming it is still not locked to the carrier) and finds out the phone is stolen. Then hopefully, there is some store policy in returning the phone to the rightful owner (me).


Is this a good way to get my phone back and are there any risk to me?


**Proposed Retrieval Method #2**
&gt; http://blog.zenone.org/2012/02/retrieving-stolen-iphone-in-under-72.html


1. I installed the Boxcar app on another apple device. This sends me emails from my AppleID email. Notably any email from noreply@me.com according to that blogger means that the iPhone was turned on. I rarely get any email so it would be easy to find out.


2. I am now playing the waiting game hoping the thief will turn the iPhone back on. If he does, I can get a approximate location of where he lives. 


3. Report to police??

Need to do something about it.,BustedBreaks,14,5,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/RBI/comments/1cfaie/second_stolen_gps_need_to_do_something_about_it/,"Hello reddit. A little over a year ago my girlfriend's car was broken into outside of our house and her GPS was stolen. I used to leave my car unlocked often and every once in a while someone would rummage through it and take something small, a usb charger or empty book bag. Since then we tried to keep our car doors locked and keep anything valuable out of sight. It worked until last week when we must have accidentally left my girlfriend's car unlocked because someone stole her replacement GPS (Stupidly, when she got her new one, I never thought to see if there was a way to register it to see where it is or something like that). I'm really tired of this. The police in my neighborhood are generally good, but I just happen to live on the road that separates our neighborhood from a somewhat worse part of the area. I try to report incidents, but there isn't much they can do as this happens randomly. Since summer is coming I expect that who ever is doing this will attempt it again. 

I'd like to set up a video camera and put some bait with a small GPS tracker in it so I can both see who is stealing from me and so I can give this info to the police. I need some advice on a camera system that isn't crazy expensive. I'd also like an affordable GPS tracker that I can trace from a website or software so I can see where it goes... Something like what Hank puts on Gus' car in Breaking Bad...Haha.  

Thanks in advance and will update with information if any comes of it. 

**tl;dr: I need suggestions for security cameras and GPS trackers**

**EDIT: Just to be clear, I realize I'll never get this stuff back, I just want to catch whoever is doing this in the act so I can give info to our town police.**

It happened a little after 1am on October 13th.

Stupid I know, it was in my butt pocket. I know I felt it when I pat my pocket when I got to the main stage. Got sandwiched with a tall white guy and a shorter asian one, pat my pocket again and it was gone. Asked both guys, they say they didn't see my phone (I should've frisk them down...).

Shortly after I knew it was taken, friends called the cell. Too noisy, not sure if someone picked up but after calling again, it went straight to voicemail (I know that I had signal inside of the place and it was at ~30% battery at the time so they probably turned it off).

Asked lost and found, they said they didn't find an iphone after cleaning up the place so I left my contact info with them in case someone turned it in.

I filed a police report the next day and occasionally check iCloud and Cylay (phone's unlocked/jailbroken T-Mobile) but because I turned off wifi/data cellular before I got into the club, device stays offline and can't located until someone somehow bypasses my pw locked screen or reset it to factory settings and gives it access to the internet.

I check craigslist to see if anything comes up in the Los Angeles area, no good leads so far :/ Regularly call but it still goes to voicemail so they probably took out the sim card. I'd check ebay more often but I'm not familiar with it.

I'm desperate to find my phone again so monetary reward for anyone that can help, thanks! No questions asked, no police involved, I'd just like it back :(

One, why does it say Facebook User when both of the people in this conversation have names in their profiles?

Two, is that address real at the bottom, or can it be faked?


It looks like it is sent from the Facebook Messenger app by Android, but it is from an iPhone (you can see the signature iPhone header on the top, and I can confirm that the person who took this has an iPhone). One more thing: the post that is in the picture, the one the facebook user refers to in her conversation, is a real and was actually posted, so that is not faked. Is it all real though?

I'd like to preface this saying that I'm going to probably immediately hear that it's creepy in a way. To that, I'd say that what I'm wanting to do here is the same as finding the friend that used to live across the street at your childhood home to reconnect as adults. 

**Story**

Anyway, I basically had a friend that I lost contact with in 2007. We both used a series of websites and forums, and in 2008 the friend stopped using any and all screennames that I knew of. Because of this, it's really difficult to find a current form of contact.

**What I've got**

Multiple usernames, emails, a birthday, and an idea of where the friend was living down to a single small road. All of this information was from around the end of 2007. What I don't have is a full name; I only have a nickname.

**What I Need Help With**

Basically, if you're interested in helping out, just let me know via PM. Since it's relatively personal information, I don't want to just give it out in the thread. I'm basically looking for any current form of contact, whether it be email, facebook, phone, or even somewhere I can mail a letter to. *I'd also be happy provide some Reddit Gold as a token of my appreciation*.

Thanks for reading! Again, if you think you might be able to help, even a little, let me know via PM and I'll share what I know.

[Here](http://www.facebook.com/HelpFindMyLongLostBrother/posts/352474284827526) is the facebook page my friend just created to find his brother.  Here's a copy and paste description.  

Hello, 
My name is Brad. I just found out that my mom gave up a baby for adoption three years before I was born. I am now on a search to find him. He may not want to meet me, I am completely prepared for this, but I would like to know that I at least tried to find him. 

His birthday is September 12, 1983 and he was born in Bountiful, Utah. This is the only information I have on him, as it w...as a closed adoption. 

I have a picture of myself (his half-brother), his biological mother, and his half sister on this page. If you read this and think you resemble us, have that birthday, and you were adopted - Please, PLEASE contact me. I would love to meet you and get to know you. 

Everyone else, please share this post on your walls and ask your friends to share it as well. It would help me so much if this could reach as many people as possible. 

Thank you!

Cont:  Please feel free to ask relavent questions on his facebook page.  This one is going to be a tough one as it was a closed adoption through LDS Adoption Services.  However, if anyone can do this, Reddit can.

I told them this was impossible as the slip had been in my letterbox all day and no one has access to that other than myself, although, the sticker on the slip has been removed that means the parcel has been collected. The staff at the depot refused to manually look in the parcel room to see if a parcel was there with my name on it and would only say that the computer has said it has been collected and that is the end of it. The contents of the parcel are a pair of grey trousers, a blue and beige jacket and a letter from my family containing cash.

I am not expecting that people can necessarily help me solve this but perhaps offer advice, I wonder if it is something I can got to the police about and I have a number that I can ring on Monday about lost post at the post office. 

My suspicions are that perhaps a postal worker has intercepted the parcel (though why then leave a slip in my letterbox), that it has mistakenly been taken to another depot (I'll ask there on Monday), that a worker at the depot has intercepted it or that the computer system at the depot is wrong and my parcel is still there.

BUTTT here goes.

In short, my biological father lives in the former Yugoslavia ... somewhere.

He came here on a green card or work visa. It expired and he had to go back home. But during his 1-2ish year stay in the US, he impregnated my mom with me! (When mom got pregnant with me, she was actually dating this US guy in the Air Force. The AF guy had a vasectomy and he knew the baby wasnt his. They got a paternity test anyways and found out for sure that I wasnt his. He stayed around till mom had me though. And signed my birth certificate. But left shortly after that.) 
(You are NOT the father)


All I know is that my biological father was in the USA when my mom got pregnant. I know his first and last name. And I have a book and an old letter written in Serbian or whatever he speaks. Someone kind of translated it but the letter wasnt written to me. It was written to someone else and he mentions knowledge of me. And he mentioned some other kids of his (I found out about this letter when I was like ... 14, and Im under the impression they are younger than me).  

My mom is getting older and cant really fill in too much for me. I have a book about a city called Ljubjiana (this is from memory ... I just moved so I dont know where the book actually is right now). And it had an address taped inside but I couldn't find the address on google maps or anything. But found something that sounded almost like it in Slovenia. But mom has always told me they lived in Serbia. 

Mom and I have always been a little too worried about my stepdad's feelings to really pursue getting in contact with my biological father (my stepdad raised me since I was 4). But now I'm 30 years old .... I mean, if not now, when?!

So if  you guys could give me some starting points. Can I talk to some embassy and explain and see if they could pull some immigration records? Or what? I have no clue where to really start. I tried to google his name but his last name is fairly common and I doubt a 50, 60 year old guy from the former Yugoslavia has a strong internet presence. 

Sidenote: My biological dad's roommate used to live in the US and probably still does. My mom was good friends with his American wife. But they've been divorced for a long time and my mom hasnt talked to them in over 20 years.

The only thing I can think of doing is emailing local Oxnard, CA High school principals and printing out the snapshots. The police also wanted copies of these items I posted so I will give that to them soon. Since I do not know if I can get my hands on digital copies of year books. The police officer who took down the info for some reason did not care much for looking at the video, in fact he didn't look at all and requested the copies instead.

Last night/this morning I got a bunch of calls from a number that belongs to a woman I knew years ago. We were both regulars at the same for several months, nearly a year ago, and we'd occasionally grab a meal together. We both started to drift apart and lost contact, until these calls.

There were 5 calls in totally. At 11:35 PM, 12:02 AM, 3:31 AM, and 3:50 AM, and 3:55 AM. The first one resulted in a very short voicemail. Google voice couldn't transcribe it. I think it's just a few words. They *seem* pretty audible, but last month I had surgery on both ears and I'm slow to get back to full hearing. Google voice's transcribing has been a huge help, especially for an occasional laugh, but this is either too brief or too inaudible to transcribe.

I can't get a hold of her. I know I shouldn't worry, and it was probably just drunk dialing, but being home-bound during recovery has me going all Rear Window on this. Can anyone shed some light on what's being said here? It sounds like there are 2 words, a pause, and 2 or 3 more words.

My gf is fine and we have collision coverage so everything is OK. I guess I am just trying to figure if there is anything RBI can do to help bring justice since the cops said this situation is typically a dead end.

I made this throwaway last month, and this post.  But the post never received any responses, and never appeared on the subreddit page or search (on my end anyway).  Between that and a major development this morning, I'm posting again in hopes it can be seen and I could get some help.**

**The quoted text is basically my original post with some updated detail changes.  The crazy latest update from this morning is under it.  I apologize for the length, but I wanted to give you guys as much info as possible.**




&gt; In the spring I was contacted by a man from  a dating site.  When he contacted me, I recognized him because we both posted in the forums.
He is originally from my area, NYC, and now lives in SF. Long story short, even though neither of us were looking for anything more than friendship and conversation, it blossomed very quickly to much more.

&gt; His personal story was quite fantastical. Almost unbelievable. From an awful family and love life, to triumphs academically and financially. We spoke every day, a few times a day, for months. Although, it was a lot to take in, I never could pinpoint a reason to doubt him.

&gt; Two months into our exchange, his personal life was thrown a major monkey wrench. However, it never swayed him from wanting to fly out to see me (or offering to pay for me to come out there) and trying to make a relationship work. A couple of weeks before we are suppose to meet, he said his life was going to be changing too much (because of the monkey wrench), and we should cut things off and ot would be easier for him to have us never speak again. He pretty much cried during the conversation.  It didn't make any sense and my attempts to reach him since have been futile.

&gt; I'm sure most of you are thinking, ""who cares, just drop it"". I can't. His story and what happened was just too weird. I'm not sure how much I can get into the details, but it is-- please trust me. Also, if certain things he told me are truthful, they are possibly dangerous.

&gt; What is weirdest of all is that I have enough information to where you would think I could easily locate him and verify his information. But the more research I do, the more I'm lost. I can't trace of this guy. Which is now bugging me out even more.




&gt; **Information I have**


&gt;  * **Name:** I have his first and last name (he said he wasn't given a middle name). His name is extremely common, which has been the big issue in my search.

&gt;  * **Birthday:** I believe I know his city of birth as well.

&gt;  * **E-mail Address**

&gt;  * **Phone Number:** He has a work assigned cell and personal cell. I have the personal number. Some voicemails to me are saved.

&gt;  * **Screenname:** The one he used on the forum.

&gt;  * **Location:** Current city and area of the city. I know of previous places he has lived. He also has claimed to currently own some properties.

&gt;  * **School/Work:** I know what colleges he attended and major.   He said he had a PhD.  The schools are in Maryland and California.  One is an Ivy.  I know what type of job he works but not clear on details.

&gt;  * **Family/Friends:** I know the name of one family member and one friend. I know how many siblings and nieces/nephews he has.

&gt;  * **Pictures:** I have three photos of him. Yes, I asked to see him on video. He never said no, but video chat was always postponed to another time.




&gt; **Research**





&gt;  * **Pictures:** The images he sent me of himself were through the site we met on. Reverse Google image search comes up empty.

&gt;  * **E-mail Address:** Googled, Spokeo'd, and Peek You'd. Nothing comes up. No results on social networking websites either. I wanted to get his IP from the header of an e-mail, but then I realized our e-mails were just from me. He would never respond back through e-mail.

&gt;  * **Phone Number:** He mentioned phone was no contract. Found out it was a MetroPCS phone (probably a burner). The name registered to the phone has the same first name, but different last name. Weirdly, this registered last name matches part of his e-mail address.  That last name is also common, and has produced nothing in searching.  **--UPDATE: This number is now registered to a different name altogether.  My best guess  is he switched his number and a new person now owns this particular number.**

&gt; However, the very odd thing about this number is it was posted in ads for an escort (dates on the ads were from early 2012). Reviews for this escort have stated they spoke to this girl on the phone and they were scammed.

&gt;  * **School/Work:** Not much here. Only guy with exact school and degree match I could find, doesn't live in his area, and is either really old or dead.

&gt;  * **Screenname:** Results are from the site we met on.

&gt;  * **Social Networking:** He said he didn't do Facebook or anything. Looked into all of them, nada.

&gt;  * **Other info:** He claims to have patents, but was going to give me the details about them âlater onâ.

&gt; Just to be clear, I don't believe this was possibly a classic ""romance scam,"" from what I know about them. He did not have a foreign accent (he had a slight NY accent if anything), he never claimed to be in another country at any point or was educated anywhere else. He never asked me for money, favors, or for confidential details. In fact, when I passingly told him money was a bit tight, he offered to send me a large sum of cash or a check-- several times. Which I found to be out of bounds, and another reason of many in wanting to confirm this guy.




-----------------**UPDATE**---------------------------------

I had rejoined the same dating site a couple of months ago, but I'm not very active.  After logging in, the bottom of the page shows a row of matches that are in your local area.  This morning, his picture was the first one to show up.

I was completely shocked.  His location was set to NYC, but a different part of the city from where he is from, and where he claims to currently own a place that he rents out.  He hated NY and vowed to never move back.  He settled and happy in SF, so WTF?

I kept reading, and there were huge discrepancies.  His height, hair/eye color, pet, and two of his photos (one he had on his original profile, and one he had sent me through the site privately) were the same.

The other two photos that were posted, I have never seen before...but they were of him.  This new profile had him listed under a completely different occupation, different education level (Masters), and three years younger.  In this ""about me"" he gave a different first name (which was also in ID name).  He stated he was ""new"" to NY.  That he was raised in AZ, went to school in Massachusetts, and landed his ""dream job"" in Los Angeles, where he has been living ever since.

I saved the photos and took screenshots of the profile.  I wrote to him with just â?â (I didnât know what to say, and was more testing to see if he would respond.  He did-- also with â?â.  I replied asking if he moved back to NY, to which he responded âI got a promotion.  Iâm in NY once a weekâ.  Based on the work and position he told me held; this would not make sense or be possible. Hell, even the style of writing seemed off.   I wrote â****, Iâm confused, and this isnât making sense so what is going onâ.  I was immediately blocked.

I was thinking maybe by chance this was someone else, these were his photos, and he blocked me thinking I was some loon who had him confused?   I quickly created another profile on the site (its free), and wrote briefly explaining what the situation was and what I was trying to figure out.  Again, I was blocked.  Shortly after, the profile information and pictures were removed.  A few minutes later, everything was deleted and the account was closed.

I can only come up with three scenarios for this: A) This is the same guy I was talking to, and he lied about almost everything, majorly slipped up, and went back into hiding.  B) Someone else has his photos, made a profile (maybe somehow knows him since some of the details were the same), embarrassed he got caught and deleted everything. C)These photos belong to someone else all together, and it's an operation done by two or more people.

**Now I need suggestions on where do I go from here.  What other avenues can I look into?  How can I proceed in finding out the truth?**
**Again, I apologize for the length, but I wanted to cover everything.  Iâve seen the awesome work this community does, and would be so thankful. I would be happy to give any personal information that might help...privately... since itâs not allowed on here.  Thank you!**

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_lighting

""Security lighting can be counter-productive. Turning off lights halved the number of thefts and burglary in ÃvertorneÃ¥ Sweden""

""A test in West Sussex UK showed that adding all-night lighting in some areas made people there feel safer, although crime rates increased 55% in those areas compared to control areas and to the county as a whole.""

""In the early seventies, the public-school system in San Antonio, Texas, began leaving many of its school buildings, parking lots, and other property dark at night and found that the no-lights policy not only reduced energy costs but also dramatically cut vandalism.""

""Bright, unshielded floodlights often prevent people from noticing criminal activity, and help criminals see what they are doing.""

""An important limitation to the usefulness of security lighting is the simple fact that it is only useful at night. This is particularly significant for home owners because, contrary to a widespread myth, most household burglaries occur during the day, when the occupants are away at work or shopping.""

Someone had thrown vomit on it and keyed it. We called the police, and filed a report, and had a chat with the officer. He said it was unlikely that we would ever catch the vandal. We don't know any people that are in the area that would want to do something like this to her. Today, we took it down to the body shop to get an estimate - it may be a total loss (on a fucking paint job, nearly the entire car has to be re-done). Then after we got home, it got interesting. We noticed yesterday when this happened that there is another car that looks exactly like hers. The color, make and model are almost identical. By this point we had already figured that it was most likely a case of mistaken identity. We saw the identical car parked near the entrance to our apartment, and went to go check it out. Upon basic inspection, it appeared to belong to someone in high school. There was a high school parking permit in the windshield, and there was a high school ID (with a visible name) and other paperwork covering the VIN in the windshield. This strengthened our suspicion that this was a case of mistaken identity in the form of a high school prank or some other high school drama gone horribly awry. We go upstairs, and I prepare this post. Then it gets really interesting. Our doorbell rings. It is a kid (that claims to be the owner of the car) at the door and his mother down the hallway. My GF is the one to answer the door, and I don't get to the door and get up to speed on what was going on. She tells me what I just wrote - a kid and his mother are outside wanting to know why we were taking pics of the kids car. GF is unsuccessful in getting them to go away, as they keep demanding to speak to ""the bearded man"" (me). So I put on some pants (yes, redditor here) and go out to talk to them and get them to go away. Immediately when I step out, they back down. I tell them that there is nothing to worry about (it appears that they thought we were casing the car, and I have some issues getting through what sounds like a mexican accent), we have a car that is almost identical and thought it was really neat. After this the kid says thank you and goes away. I am thinking that this kid could lead me to whoever did this, or at least point me in the right direction. What are your thoughts? I would like to know how best to proceed from here. http://imgur.com/a/Le5eZ

Any help you can provide would be amazing. (For the record, moore PD and the pawn shop owners assoc. have been given the full rundown)

Hello everyone, first time posting here. Not a guitarist myself, but i come from a long line of pickers. One of those being my uncle, Alan. My family is from Moore, Oklahoma and as you know, we've been through some shit the last few weeks. thankfully none of my family was hurt, and we had very little property damage, but in the aftermath of the storms, we weren't so lucky. see theres a reall shitty subset of people in the world, and when they see/hear about a tragedy they get dollar signs in their eyes and decide to to fuck over their fellow man. This manifested itself in the theft of ALL my uncle's band equipment.

He plays in a band called ""Brown Note"", and has been building his sound setup for 25 years. it was his pride and joy. But last week, after loading up their trailer on wednesday, for a friday show, my uncle returned to his house to find it gone. all of it. 70k worth of speakers, boards, guitars, and all sorts of home made shit he'd made over the years. Luckily it was insured, but insurance can only do so much.

The biggest casualty was my uncle's favorite guitar. His Charvel. here's a pic of [""The Goat""](http://i.imgur.com/wfYUpha.jpg) .

Its a Charvel San Dimas Style 2. and is out of production. My late Grandpa helped him pick it out, and it means the world to him.

So my request is this, oh axe-wielders of reddit. If by ANY small chance anyone EVER sees this guitar, or any of the other equipment in my post to /r/oklahoma please let me know. the rest of the equipment is whatever. it was insured, but that guitar was an extension of him. It would mean the world to my family to have it back. Thanks for your time everyone.

Help a girl out!,GFMReddit,8,4,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/RBI/comments/1favuo/stolen_in_los_angeles_white_2003_buell_xb9r/,"TL;DR- Motorcycle found parked damaged/moved on Sunday, filed as hit and run. Monday it was missing, assuming Sunday was result of failed 1st attempt. Footage taken with motorcycle just out of frame, but catches the act. 


Saturday May 25th 11:30PM, White 2003 Buell XB9R is parked 70ft south of NE corner of Laurel Canyon and Tiara in Valley Village, just after gated driveway and next to a station wagon. [Here are the images of the bike, and after the following incident.](http://imgur.com/a/UQPKX) 

Sunday May 26th at 1:30PM, I see my bike is parked at an angle that I wouldn't usually do. I see there is damage to both sides of my bike, and guess the bike has been hit/tipped and propped back up. Same vehicle is still next to me which belongs to an old lady residing in the building. I leave a note with the landlord asking for security footage from driveway entrance before accusing her and calling the police. No call was returned, so I file a report in the evening for suspected hit and run. 

Monday morning my bike is missing. File stolen vehicle report, and then landlord unofficially shows me the video. At 11:12 PM Sunday night, footage of what appears to be a beige truck with similar appearance to a [Ford F150](http://www.nelsonsauction.com/2008-sales/2008-08-16/2001_Ford_F150_ext_cab_4x4.jpg) headed Northbound on Laurel Canyon slowing down. They pulled next to my motorcycle, then 2 men used a trolly to hold my locked front wheel while they rolled it on to the truck bed. Like the picture,  the truck has windows for the back seat that are separated from the passenger window by some of the frame. Video quality is too grainy to make out much else.

Monday being a holiday, most businesses were closed, detectives had the day off, and security company handling building cameras have the day off. Smart, as Tuesday I'm told by numerous places that their cams only save 24 hours of footage (probably a lie from low level employees who don't know/care). Canvas the neighborhood and see that KarTek across the street has high res video showing the traffic, report it to the detective, and he claims it's too far away to really matter. What no one seems to understand or care about is it I find any images of the truck passing, I can more easily get a make/model, put together a route of where they were heading, and possibly eventually find a business with video catching the license number. Obviously the detective doesn't care to put this much effort into it, which I'm happy to do, but businesses don't cooperate when a little 120 pound girl asks to see their security cams. 

VIN is 4MZAX57J533420153 and license is 16S7035. What appears to be the gas tank is actually a plastic cover which can be removed and will likely be sold, and if they remove the EBR sticker decal there should be a shadow of where it used to be. Foot pegs are [EBR race pegs](http://www.erikbuellracing.com/store/parts-accessories/bodywork/1125-rider-footpeg-bracket-set-with-rigid-pegs.html) that I believe can only be used on other Buells. [ASV shorty levers with red adjustment wheel](http://www.roadcarvin.com/sites/default/files/images/ASV_Levers_4035.preview.jpg) which I believe may have shown up on [craigslist](http://losangeles.craigslist.org/lgb/mcy/3835350869.html) already. According to the detective, because most parts will not have an ID number, I can't prove it's mine so they won't investigate.

Lambda was changed to L, everything is solid as far as my original transcription (as solid as you can be when using the Thelema alphabet). The only symbols I could not clearly identify were left out, and numbers 4 and 5 may be different. Other than that, I am 100% sure about this being accurate.

***And now on to the original post:

From the code on this link:

http://www.zodiackillerciphers.com/?p=179

Here is what I figured out.
I added the lines, then added each subtotal. It equals 418. Here is the significance of that number, as far as I can find (Aleister Crowley called it Abrahadabra):

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abrahadabra

Here is how I got **418**. Using the Zodiac Killer's code (see above), I listed the mathematical difference between each number, reading downward in vertical lines in order (as if it were Japanese and not English). The first integer is the mathematical difference, the second integer, aka after the [:], is how many times it occurred in a row. The totals of these numbers, with their appropriate positive or negative attributes, gave me a subtotal for each line. These subtotals, also both positive and negative, equaled 418.



Line 1:  +22:5, -419:1, +22:4, +1:1; +22:10, Line 1= 0

Line 2:  -187:1, +22:8, +1:1, +22:5, -419:1, +22:5, Line 2= 0

Line 3: +254:1, +22:3, -419:1, +22:3, +1:1, +22:12, Line 3= 232

Line 21: -187:1, +22:10, +1:1, +22:4, -419:1, +22:4   Line 21= -209


Total is + 418 (From the sum of individual lines' totals.)

Here is some of what the Wiki article says about Abrahadabra and 418:

""ABRAHADABRA has 11 letters
ABRAHADABRA = 1+2+2+1+5+1+4+1+2+2+1 = 22
The five letters in the word are: A, the Crown; B, the Wand; D, the Cup; H, the Sword; R, the Rosy Cross; and refer further to Amoun the Father, Thoth His messenger, and Isis, Horus, Osiris, the divine-human triad.
Also 418 = ATh IAV, the Essence of IAO, translated from Hebrew as âThou art IAOâ
418= BVLShKIN, or Boleskine
418= RA HVVR, or Ra Hoor
418= ××¨×-×¨×-××, a Hebrew spelling of Heru-Ra-Ha
418= AIFÎÎ£Î£, a Greek spelling of Aiwass
418= The sum of all integers between 13 and 31 inclusive.
Abrahadabra is from Abrasax, Father Sun, which = 365 [10]
418 = 22 x 19 Manifestation""



*Notice the 22x19=Manifestation, which is the number of times the difference of 22 occurred in line 1, only. The other lines had it reoccurring in even amounts each.*

Edit: I looked up the 800+ pg. FBI file where this magic square was from. Also in there were a couple of photocopies of detailed pictures of someone practicing Thelema (robed magician sitting in a pentagram, etc), from a book or other publication.

I looked up every older alphabet I could find, and though some of the Greek and Latin symbols I found were similar to those in the 340 Zodiac cipher, nothing matched up so much as that of Thelema. Yes, it has its own alphabetâand a very ambiguous one at that. Thelema has two alternates for every letter, and uses pictures. Many of the pictures matched up to the Zodiac's.

So in fact, I think maybe his code was taken from the Thelema alphabet. My guess is that back in the day, this alphabet was not readily available (thanks to the internet). Here it is:

By replacing only about half of the symbols (and not taking liberties or replacing those which did not have a clear alternate), Here is what I found in the 340 cipher:

He was seen in a verbal dispute with a man and a woman. The man struck my cousin in the back of the head with a weapon, causing serious brain damage, the couple then ran off. Since this assault my cousin has been in a coma, and condition is extremely serious. He may not live (He has suffered several strokes and other setbacks while in the ICU) and if he does he will almost certainly have permanent brain damage.

A bit about my cousin: He's a 22 year old guy, just about to start his first year at university, not at all a trouble maker, never been in a fight in his life, laid back, likes to play videogames, watch ted videos, typical stuff. Blood tests showed that he was not drunk when the assault happened.

The suspects: You can view surveillance camera pictures of the suspects here:

[http://www.torontopolice.on.ca/newsreleases/pdfs/23951.pdf](http://www.torontopolice.on.ca/newsreleases/pdfs/23951.pdf)

One is a white male, 25â35, 5â8ââ5â10â, medium build with a shaved head. He was last seen wearing a Portugal soccer jersey. The other is a woman described as having a dark complexion, 25â30, with long, black, curly hair.

They both appear to be smoking.

We've created a website with more details at at [http://www.justicefordan.ca](http://www.justicefordan.ca)

Earlier in the day there had been a soccer game between Spain and Portugal. The male suspect is wearing a Portugal jersey with what looks like a number 7 on the front which is Renaldo's number.

Please take a look and share these pictures with anyone who you know who might have been in the area. This was a savage and unprovoked attack that's left a good guy fighting for his life.  If you have any suggestions or questions please feel free to ask.  I've cross posted this from /r/toronto

I was in probably 8th grade and got a random instant message on AOL instant messenger from someone I didn't know. They asked if I was ""x"" (I wasn't) so it seemed like an innocent mistake but we got to chatting (it was a girl's screen name so at that age I was excited to talk to almost any girl) at first about innocent stuff but it turned sexual quickly (and if you guys remember A/S/L whoever it was knew very quickly that I was in the 11-13 range)

The person would ask about what sexual experiences I had had and what I was doing and what I liked. I would send pictures (non - sexual) of me in hopes of impressing this ""girl"". The girl would send me pictures of pornography (girls) and we would send dirty IMs back and forth (""she"" would ask me to describe in detail me masturbating etc.) 

She would always say she was going to send me pictures as soon as she was at her dad's house (said her parents were divorced and she lived with her mom) but only sent me one picture (fake off the internet I'm sure) the whole time we talked. We probably talked about a year before either we stopped messaging back and forth. (Can't remember why we stopped)

Looking back, obviously I was naive, but the whole thought creeps me out and makes me worried that this is some predator who is doing this to other young people which is why I'm posting, maybe there is a way to uncover their identity or potentially stop a predator.

Sorry for the long back story, here are the details I know:
AIM Screen name : keilyp   (formatted to look like KellyP)
Said she lived in ""West Virginia"" but who knows.

I went to aol.com and clicked ""forget password""  for that screen name and it said I could send a link to following email address to reset the password (I didn't)

d*****e@msn.com   (The stars are put in by AOL)

Who knows, this could have been a classmate pulling a prank but with the length of time it went on and the graphic nature, something feels wrong.

      My mother had her credit card information stolen a few months ago. As soon as she had noticed odd transactions (about $60 in credit checks and a subscription to lovefilm.com) she had the card canceled and the number switched. Also, she has been receiving phone calls from Auto insurance (local, quote on 2010 nissan pathfinder), medical insurance, and credit repair services. These phone calls seem odd because they have been to her work phone which she has had for only a year. Not her cell phone.

From my understanding, the credit check (not the one who called) was for someone else but paid by her card. When asked for a name they could only give us a first name and last initial.

So far the only action taken by my mother has been switching cards. Is there anything else that could possibly be done to help secure her information? Should I file a report to the police? Lastly, any tips to help find out more information on who/how this was done?

I appreciate any responses. Thanks RBI!

* If the message is read after that, *it's not a problem.*

After that, her father stopped checking in and she hasn't ever heard from him again.  

Here's what we know (I'm trying to leave out her info, just because, you know, internet stuff)

* Her father's name was Hui-Song Cho, with 'Song' possibly spelled slightly differently. NOT the Virginia Tech shooter.
* He had a son she thinks was named Adam (Cho?), who would be in his early or mid 20s now, probably born between 1985-1990. She remembers visiting her father in D.C. and that he had a son.
* Hui-Song may have moved back to South Korea, to live with his mother.
* Her father was a slender, relatively in-shape man, I think in his late 30s or early 40s when he would've had Adam.  My wife says, as a Korean he loved wearing trucker hats, and was very proud of his appearance.
* Hui's father was a bus driver, who committed suicide after getting into an accident that killed some of his passengers.
* Hui met my wife's mother while working on/near a US Naval base in South Korea.
* My wife's sister was born in Seoul, so it stands to reason that her father lived there.

The only thing we have to go on is what they call ""non-identifying information"" as provided by the adoption agency. Non-identifying information is exactly that-- vague references, no names, nothing that can be used to identify the place or person. I am hoping with enough research and some educated guesses I can figure out some of the facts. 

I listed all the vague facts we received below in hopes someone might  be able to provide me with some good guesses as to what the real info might be. There is a lot of info, so I put my actual questions for you in parens below, hope it's not too confusing. If anyone has any ideas or research tips in general, I would love to hear them (we've also tried 3 dna services and all the adoption registries and have come up dry).

-My boyfriend's birth mother was born in 1941/1942 in Ontario, Canada and lived in a town bordering the US. This town was very close to a US military base in Michigan.

(Which town could this be? what are the options for military bases, probably air force?)

--Facts about the birth mother: while growing up in Canada, she took lessons in piano, dance and violin. She attended presbytarian church and sang in the choir. She graduated high school with honors in Canada (1957-ish?) and worked in an attorney's office (family law focused) for two years before getting married in 1959.

(if I can figure out the town she lived in, I can start looking at high school reunion sites and research the law firm).

-Facts about birth mother's family: her father was from England before moving to Canada and at was at one time a concert pianist. I estimate he was likely born sometime between 1900-1920, based on her birthdate in 1942, but have no idea.

(any way to get more info on concert pianists in England/Canada in this timeframe?).

The birth mother's father left the family shortly after her birth and moved to a ""northern central US state"" and operated a wood business. The birth mother's mother worked as a crane operator ""during the war"" (did not specify which war) and later died of uterine cancer. The birth mother had twin brothers who later married and had children in Canada. One of these twin brothers had a child with muscular dystrophy (born 1960 or 1961).

(is it odd that the she worked as a crane operator? Any guesses where this might have been?)

-Facts about birth mother meeting her husband: Sometime in the late 50's to 1960, the birth mother met her future husband while he worked on a US military base near the border of Canada (i believe this was in Michigan). He had just joined the military and worked as a ""heavy equipment operator"".

(any ideas what ""heavy equipment operator"" is code for?)

They married and lived on the Michigan base, and she had two children while there-- James, born in 1959-60 timeframe and Kevin, born in 1960-61 timeframe. In either 1962 or 1963 they moved to Tyndall AFB in Florida.

In 1964, the birth mother lived on Tyndall AFB (Panama City, FL) with her husband. She was 22 years old, 5'6, 135 pounds with brown hair dyed black and ""pleasingly striking"" in appearance.  The birth mother belonged to a local Presbyterian Church at or near Tyndall and may have sung in the choir.  

The birth mother's husband (NOT my boyfriend's birth father) was 26 years old in 1964-- he was a serviceman and worked as a ""heavy equipment operator"".  Her husband was sent to Asia in 1963 and returned in January 1964-- when he returned he suffered from infectious hepatitis and was hospitalized at Tyndall for one month to recover.

While the birth mother's husband was on assignment in Asia, the birth mother claims that she ""went out one evening and was taken advantage of"" and became pregnant.  She claimed not to know the birth father's name and only states that he was caucasian and a serviceman.  [Note:  it is entirely possible that the birth mother may have stretched the truth on this portion-- perhaps had an affair with this other serviceman].

When the birth mother's husband returned, she told him about the pregnancy and they agreed she should give the baby up for adoption (baby born on July 2, 1964 in the hospital on Tyndall AFB).

My daughter's biological father has long been a source of headaches around here, and while I used to keep tabs on him and his whereabouts - it has grown to be more of a chore than any kind of thrill in finding this guy. Honestly, I know my daughter will never see a dime of child support from him, and I don't mind. I see it as ""protection money"" - he's keeping it instead of paying it, and will stay as far away as possible from us!

Anyway, I know at the moment he's incarcerated (again) in Colorado. I know it's near Durango, but I don't know anything about counties, state, or why he was picked up this time. I have last known whereabouts dating back several years, full name, aliases, photos, birthday, and criminal history (that I know of anyway!)

I'm not sure what is needed to track him down, or what would get me in trouble as ""posting personal information"" here. I really would just like a record of what his criminal activity has been so I know how far to stay away really.

And then there's a side mission, should you choose to accept it... he claims he has a child from when he was 16. He claimed that the girl died as a toddler. As of my search 2 years ago, I could never find any record that this child ever existed or died - and his story about her always seemed fishy, but he does have a tattoo of the initials he claims this little girl had for a name. It would be nice to know if my daughter has or had another half-sister out there...

Anyway, I also have information about biological family of his as well as information about his adoptive family... names, dates, all the good stuff.

Will someone direct me as to the next step? What to post, what to PM, and what is needed to get some answers?

If nothing else, It would be nice to know what to tell my daughter when she's an adult and wants to know what happened to her father :(

An ordinary office, in a semi-factory complex, the gray doors situated between two offices, on the left, a pharmaceutical company on the right, one that makes parts for airplanes.

CAMERA PANS

Our hero walks up to the door, he opens it and sees a pretty ordinary office, polished plywood floors, generic blue cubicles and windows overlooking the loading bay.

As he steps in from the smell of asian food from the nearby shops, he notices another, more peculiar smell. At first, the smell hits him like burnt chillis, hitting the nostrils first before causing his eyes to water. He starts coughing.

He quickly opens up the windows and escapes the room, back into the relative safety of cooking oil and smell of various exotic spices coming from down stairs.

He only had one question in his mind.

What has been plaguing his office for the past 3 months?

It was brand new, there were no ventilation shafts into the room aside from the A/C, the smell becomes less noticeable as the room gets aired.

Maybe he had to call the RBI for help this time. He picked up his laptop and started typing...

Here's what I know.

* My roommate has had a stalker for a long while now. 
* The stalker seems to be able to enter our apartment without using force.
* We're not sure who this could be.  
* She has attempted to get the police involved. They said something along the lines of needing proof. (I'm a little hazy on this part)
 

I personally think the stalker is toying with her. Anytime she moves to a new place he purposely lets her know he can still find her. 

It seems like he is ALWAYS watching. I'm super freaked out. I hid my car for a week, and didn't leave the apartment for at least a few days. I never saw anyone suspicious, and nobody came to our door. I finally had to leave town and the Stalker broke in. 




If anyone has any ideas for catching this guy, then that would be great. 

Alternatively, how do I get the police involved? It sounds like my roommate needs to get murdered before there is even a cop at the door. 

TL;DR: Super stalker is going to murder my roommate and the police think they are in a teen horror flick.

Every time they hit papers are scattered inside the car, the glove compartment and car doors are left open and they seem aware of hidden  compartments within the vehicle that most people wouldn't notice especially at night (ex. pull out or pull down cup holders). And a terrible stench that is left behind. We keep calling the police but they claim they are unable to help us.

We have one guy we suspect  whose a known drug user and former car mechanic who smells of the same stench that is left behind. But no proof to put him away.

The damage is fairly high up on the body and there isn't much paint transfer, so my not-very-educated guess that it was hit by a larger commercial vehicle or a trailer, but I may be completely off with my guess as well.

She is out of town at the moment, and this happened in the town she's staying in now. She visited a friends place a few weeks back and had been working on her macbook while she was there. Her friend *x* invited *x*'s friend *y* over as well.

When my friend took a walk to the corner store, she came back to see the lights were off and assumed *x* and *y* were going at it, so she walked to her grandmothers and returned the next day to find that her laptop is now missing. She strongly believes that *y* stole it, and *x* is likely in on it.

She will be returning home in 23 days, and any proof of purchase she may have is at home. She has nothing on her that can legitimately prove that this laptop is hers, though due to her work on it, it could easily be proven in the content that it belongs to her supposing it hasn't been wiped yet. She also has not previously installed any sort of ""Find my iPhone"" software on the computer so she can't use a GPS method to find it, and Apple won't help.

She's positive she knows who took it, so this should be fairly straightforward if she's right, but can you guys give any advice as to other methods she can go about legitimately proving that it's hers and where it is, and how to retrieve it within the 23 day time limit she has before leaving? Even if it's past the 23 days, it would be worth getting her hands on again, but I don't think she wants to leave without the thief getting at least a little karma headed his way.

They said he traveled through the other 3 rooms and started two fires in each corner of the room. Then walk calmly back out the door he came? There was linen, sheet, and cloths of sorts on there thathe caught on fire. Have you ever tried to catch folded linen on fire? I can't imagine it would be to easy. Fast forward to the day he took the plea deal because he was facing 35yrs to life and was in front of the judge. The judge was asking my son all kinds of questions. Why did you do it? What were you thinking? How did you do it? What kind of stuff did you catch on fire? What did you use? Cody had the same answer everytime. I don't know your honor. He didn't know, because he didn't do it. They gave him 6 yrs for though.

[xpost from /r/metalmusicians &amp; /r/metal],werzcaseontario,8,8,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/RBI/comments/1dpb88/stolen_guitar_empyrean_plague_has_a_guitar_stolen/,"So Empyrean Plague was doing a tour of Eastern Canada and had one of their guitars stolen. It is a green sunburst Yamaha Ty Tabor signature model guitar with EMG 85 pick-ups. It was in a black hard case with some Empyrean Plague stickers on the outside. There were also a boss tuner and chrome decimator noise gate pedal inside.

This guitar is very sentimental and only has one knob. All other knobs were removed.

It was stolen on one of these tour dates (where exactly Im not sure yet, will update with more info)

But this situation that I find myself thinking about is something I've never experienced before.


One of my clients came in (she isn't rich or super wealthy or anything) and was visibly upset. She's had a bad week. She had some issues with her car's tires and unfortunately had to take it to firestone to get new ones. 


One of the employees there was checking under the hood ""for good customer service reasons"" and my client explains ""I just had a lot of work done on the car, I know there is no issue with anything underneath it and would appreciate it if you stopped and just fixed the tires"".



She tells me that the firestone employee was very very upset, like she just bruised his ego or something and had a very unusual reaction to the response.



These people had her address and various sensitive details about my client. 


Needless to say her tire had a 5 inch slash in it. She lives in a gated community and the creeps who did it must have waited for someone to let them in.


Its a quieter neighborhood and she could hear the car driving away quickly.



this is a much older lady. Very very sweet and nice. She treats me with respect and kindness and we chat often. I can't imagine her having enemies.


My urge to kill can't be controlled..... I'm fucking mad and want to do something. 



But these people are obviously dangerous and aren't afraid to retaliate.


We don't have total proof. All I have so far is that its obviously a male, hispanic, dark skin and I know where he works.

So I was called about a month ago by a private investigation company in Los Angeles that had been looking for my mother and Aunt (the two heirs to my maternal grandmother). They said that they were owed substantial funds (the low to mid six figures) from something my grandmother had. (we don't know if they were unknown bonds, a pension, life insurance, etc.) Of course, the company won't tell us what the funds are from until we sign something that says that they will receive 35% of any found funds. Obviously, I'm trying to circumvent using them and finding the funds ourselves.

I've gone on all the ""Unclaimed Funds"" sites to no avail. I've checked with a couple of life insurance companies, etc.

My thought process (and this is where I need your help) is:
The PI company is doing the opposite of what we're doing. He must have a list of names of people owed money and his job is to find their heirs.

So does he have some software? Where would he find such a list?

She lives about 2 hours away from me but we've both honestly been busy her being in high school and me with just life honestly and I haven't had the time to visit plus her parents have to give it the OK.

She's sent me a ton of pictures, when I ask usually but sometimes she doesn't and makes up excuses. This girl isn't out of my league at all shes good looking but it doesnt seem too far fetched. We talk on the phone daily for around 5+ hours and she's really awesome to be honest. Here's where my problem starts. She's had past boyfriends in long distance relationships and some where she's from that SEEM to check out.

I found another account on the same site with a different last name (one of her parents). This is where stuff gets really fishy. She always will call me with her friends and list off their names or say who she's with, so I recognize a few of their names. I checkout this newly found account and see a lot of familiar first names in there. I start scrolling through the tweets and a lot of them are similar subjects at around the same time. This is where stuff gets almost locked in. I notice that one of her close relatives passed away on the SAME DAY. Her grandparents are in the same hospital as this new account. 

So I bring this up to her we argue about trust and the next day 50+ posts on this site are deleted most are ones we talked about but some aren't. This is too obvious so I'm not sure what's up there. 

There's more details which I'm sure I forgot, anyway I should go about finding out before I drive out there?

1347732772.0,0,self.RBI,zxnti,"In my opinion it's likely that Eugene Christopher Wright was framed for the murder of Ken Dolezsar by David Novak. /r/RBI, what do you think? Details inside.",maybe_innocent,1,1,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/RBI/comments/zxnti/in_my_opinion_its_likely_that_eugene_christopher/,"Here's the story: David Novak is a very smart, charming, and likeable guy who is also a convicted white collar criminal. He apparently is involved in some shenanigans involving faking his own death and filing a false insurance claim for which he spends a year in prison.


After prison Novak meets this really wealthy guy, Ken Dolezsar. Dolezsar is worth over $100 million and had inherited his money from his wife (perfect target for swindling). Novak befriends Dolezsar and talks him into investing lots of money into various projects and scams, including $2 million for some crappy movie.


In my opinion, at some point Novak realizes that it would be easier to bump off Dolezsar and take off with the money rather than explain why all these projects aren't going anywhere. Novak knows, however, that if Dolezsar is bumped off all fingers will point to him because of the financial incentive. Some of Novak's friends quote him as saying during an unguarded moment that the perfect way to commit a crime is to pin it on someone else (so the police stop looking).


Novak finds a nice real estate developer living in a neighboring condo who looks kind of like a stereotypical hitman (Eugene Christopher Wright) and introduces him to Dolezsar. Dolezsar is supposed to give a couple million to Wright for a real estate deal. Then Novak (who has the key to Wright's condo[1]) possibly plants a shell casing in Wright's apartment and possibly obtains some DNA to plant in Dolezsar's car. Novak gets Wright to buy an untraceable cellphone to talk to Dolezsar, which Wright later gives back to Novak. Then Novak (who has bragged before about being connected to Russian mafia) hires a hitman who kind of looks like Wright to kill Ken Dolezsar, using the cellphone to lure Dolezsar to his death. Ken Dolezsar is assassinated on Nov 15, 2007.


When the police come by asking questions, Novak is the one who points them in the direction of Wright. During the investigation all the evidence points to Wright: the cellphone, the casing, the DNA, and a weak eyewitness. While police are investigating, Novak, who is friends with Wright, spends time with Wright's wife and asks her a lot of questions about the investigation. After Wright is arrested, Novak suddenly leaves town.


During the 11 hour deliberations, the jury ask to see the eyewitness video again. Eyewitness misidentification is the single greatest cause of wrongful convictions nationwide, playing a role in nearly 75% of convictions overturned through DNA testing [2]. Wright is convicted of the murder of Ken Dolezsar.


It really bugs me that it's likely that a sociopath criminal framed an innocent man here, and the justice system totally fell for it. If you just follow the money it's obvious that Novak had a huge incentive to kill Dolezsar (millions of dollars that wouldn't have to be accounted for) while Wright had a huge dis-incentive (by killing Dolezsar he would be losing his real estate deal before it had a chance to happen). Plus Novak is a convicted criminal and as far as I know Wright's record is clean.


You can watch the crime special for the story: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FINb2kAeeV0](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FINb2kAeeV0). If someone could get Wright's wife to do an AMA that would be awesome.
