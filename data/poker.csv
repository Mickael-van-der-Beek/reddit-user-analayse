Arrived about 2pm, got on a list, and got unto a newly opened 1/3 NL table filled with fish who were checking out the new casino.  

Good times were had by all, I talked to the guy next to me about the upcoming car show that was coming to town, somebody else collected motorcycle license plates, the table discussed the Baltimore Ravens defense, and if the local college basketball team was going to win tonight.

And all the while, I was folding, playing my premiums, and building up my stack little by little until I had about $700 in front of me. By this time, seeing what a good time and soft table we had, quite a list of sharks had built up.

So around 5pm, couple of the fish had to rebuy, and two of the better players finally left the table.  They were replaced by two hoodie wearing, sunglass wearing, ear buds plugged in internet kiddie ""pros"".

One of them was instantly feeling kind of salty when his online aggression 4bet all-in shove with pocket 10s was snap called by my pocket AAs.  He spent the rest of the time providing an after hand analysis of where the winner of the pot could have 3bet for more value or where the loser should have check folded.  

They both unplugged one of their ear buds, so they could chat with each other and discuss their VPIP percentages, and adjustments they made to their 3-bet merged ranges, and what the ideal c-bet percetages where on dry flops. No more talk from the fish about old cars they used to own, or football, or who was going to win the big game.  

In fact the fish, instead of busting out, started racking up their chips and leaving the game one-by-one.  As each fish left, he was replaced with more competent players who were starting to arrive or had been on the list.  I finally racked up my $500 profit myself after the last bad player left, and the game consisted of a bunch of grinders trying to steal the $4 in blinds from each other, while the internet pro kiddies were discussing if one was raising for value or raising to narrow the field with AQ.

Good job guys.  I could have spent the next few hours extracting another $500 and having a good time, but I guess it was more important that you guys impress everybody with your vast poker knowledge.  Maybe you guys could start a training site -- How Not To Make Money At A Soft Table.

1368884699.0,161,self.poker,1ekqm7,Stanky-Leg Giveth And Stanky-Leg Taketh Away,TheMadFlyentist,191,30,67,http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/1ekqm7/stankyleg_giveth_and_stankyleg_taketh_away/,"I encountered an interesting dynamic at the cardroom last night, and, in addition to a being a crazy story, I think there is some unique live cash game strategy to be learned here:

I got to the poker room just after dark; it was crowded, but not packed. After hitting the cashier cage, I found my seat at one of the many active $1/$2 NLHE tables. As soon as I sat down, a fellow youngster to my immediate right grumbled ""Welcome to the table, bro. This clown (motions to an elderly black gentleman sitting across from us) has been going all-in like every hand and turning over trash."" 

I thanked the guy for the heads up, and settled into my seat. Over the next half hour, I proceeded to watch the gentleman that he motioned towards play like an absolute madman. He was clearly drunk, and clearly had money to blow. His preflop raises were typically to $20 or more and he did not hesitate to shove on any flop that he so much as grazed. It should also be mentioned that every time he turned over a winner (or a few times, a bluff), he would shout ""STANKY LEG!"" and proceed to stand up and perform the Stanky-Leg. YouTube the dance if you are unfamiliar, and then imagine a frail, 70 year old black man doing it after throwing 4s/5s on the table for bottom-two. All of the dealers knew this man as Stanky-Leg and apparently he was typically a 5/10 player, though I've never seen him before. Honestly, it was a pretty entertaining table.

As any reasonable player would, I decided to just wait for my spot to either re-pop him pre or call him in position and hope to double through his aggression. He had been running over most of the table and had a stack of about $500 at this point. On the rare occasions that his shoves were called, he turned over hands like Qx suited, Ace-rag, and suited connectors, typically for nothing better than top pair. Of course, the ""good"" players at the table were berating him for playing ""such trash"". Luckily a guy on my left gave one very stern ""Don't tap the glass"" and the conversation shifted to football. Tim Tebow to be exact. Blech.

Anyway, it was probably 45 minutes after I sat down that I looked down at two bullets in middle-position. Stanky-Leg was in the big blind and I had seen him defend his blinds like a wounded animal, so I decided just to raise instead of getting tricky. I made it 15 to go (pretty standard at this point thanks to Stanky) and both he and the small blind called. Flop came A97 rainbow, Stanky bet, I shoved, SB folded and Stanky called with a ragged ace. I doubled through Stanky and offered to buy him a drink, only to find out that he had been cut off by the house. He said ""Thanks anyway, youngblood"" and gave me a fist-bump.

So, with mission accomplished and roughly $500 in front of me now, I complacently leaned back and settled in, fully prepared not to play anything less than top-ten hands for the rest of the evening. Then, it happened.

One of the ""good"" players who had been berating Stanky earlier for playing trash decides to shove pre-flop from UTG for $307. That's right. 

He made some speech about how he can't seem to see any flops thanks to Stanky, so he sees no option other than to shove. It folded to Stanky, who was suddenly very serious. Like *scary* serious. 

Stanky stacked out $307 exactly but didn't push it forward just yet. He looked up and made eye contact with the shover. ""You ain't played a hand in two hours, so I know you got aces or kings,"" Stanky declares. ""But I'll tell ya, I'm all the way live over here."" 

There was an awkward moment of silence as the two stared each other down, until finally Stanky said ""Lez do it"" and pushed his stacks in with one hand. The blinds fold. Original shover turned over KK; Stanky flipped up 8d9d. The guy with KK literally let's out a howl of victory. The woman on his left says ""Good play"".

The dealer assembles the pot and the whole table watches intently as he burns one card peels off three more. The window card is the six of diamonds. Full flop is 6d7dTd. Our table goes GORILLAS. Stanky literally leaps out of his seat and screams ""STANKY LEEEEEEGGGGG"" and busts a serious move. I started laughing like a small child on Christmas morning, as did most of the table, save of course for homeboy with KK, who couldn't be saltier. He hadn't said a word and was just sitting with fists clenched, staring at the board in disbelief. 

As though it mattered, the dealer burned and turned one more. Adding insult to injury, it was a king. The table this time let out a group ""OHHH"" as we all briefly sympathized with what's-his-face. Even the dealer tilted his head a bit, as though he was slightly pained by the cards he had dealt. With two raps on the felt, the dealer burns one and shows us the river. The table goes silent. It's the case king.

Just when I thought that the guy with KK was gonna take his beat like a pro and quietly re-buy, he proves me wrong. ""JEEEEZUS CHRIST!"" he belts out, ""WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT SHIT?!? I MAKE THE PERFECT PLAY AND HE FLOPS A FUCKING STRAIGHT FLUSH, THEN I RUN QUADS?!?! GOD DAMMIT!.."" A supervisor appeared behind him and tapped him on the shoulder. ""Sir,"" he said, ""you need to relax.""

Steaming, but not stupid, the man shut up. He reached into his pocket and pulled out two crisp Franklins to re-buy. Another supervisor came over and informed Stanky that he had just won the high-hand for the hour, which ended right after the crazy hand did. The supervisor then handed Stanky $750 cash.

Stanky turns to the table and announces ""Guess what? I'm buyin' all y'all muhfuggas a drank!... Except for you!"" He points at the man who had KK.

Still visibly furious, the man retorted ""And why is that?"" 

Stanky leaned back, finished piling his chips into loose stacks and said quite succinctly ""Because you a whiny bitch.""



I'm not sure if there is a moral to this story or whether it's just one of the craziest things I've ever seem in a cardroom. I guess my takeaway is: pick your spots, and don't be a whiny bitch. Guys like Stanky-Leg aren't at the table every night, you have to capitalize when they are. And if you ever run quads after someone flops a straight flush in your eye, take it like a man. Otherwise, you may cost yourself some respect, or more importantly, a free drink.

I worked for FTP at a high level and watching these Howard videos has moved me from rage to sadness to sympathy to fucking god damn rage again.  

Howard has always been great at navigating his media persona and this is no different.  It’s damage control to his image, and more importantly, to establish his plausible deniability in what happened.  

Cutting to the chase, if you want someone to hate for your FTP troubles, it’s  Ray Bitar and Gil Coronado, who knew exactly what they were doing.  I can’t say for sure if Howard knew the depths of their incompetence and where they were taking  the company. I can say that with the move to Dublin, Howard really did lose touch with what was going on.   

 Did Howard and company empower Ray and turn a blind eye to what was happening, most definitely.   

I remember when guys like Perry and Juanda disappeared, they saw the writing on the wall, sure it took some years for them to be proved right, but here we are. Oh, and I do remember Alan’s last name. lol. He was a good guy and left because he also realized it was a bad company to hitch his wagon to.  

It disgusts me that despite board members realizing how incompetent Ray was that he was allowed to continue running the company.  

It disgusts me that Howard is trying paint a bad picture of board members who recognized a problem. FTP was always run like an old boy’s club, protect the tribe versus doing what’s right.  The loans we floated guys like Matusow  and  Benyamine were disgusting.  

We couldn’t enforce our normal policies against “big poker names” when the situation warranted. We were told “I’ll talk to them.” From Howard himself.  I hated it.  

•	Aldernay License? – Yeah, they lied and fudged numbers to get it. No big deal.  

•	The idea that they didn’t know they were circumventing banking protocols is absolutely ridiculous.  

•	Hiring competent managers? LMAO … Just check out how many Bitar family members were on the payroll.  

•	If you do some research, you’ll find several lawsuits from previous employees and  other’s who have dealt with FTP’s unethical behavior.  

•	Player’s rights and experience were never a priority, getting their money was.  This doesn’t come as a surprise to anyone who had to deal with customer service.    


Anyways… feel free to AMAA … about the Howard videos or my time with FTP.  In order to protect my identity and previous coworkers I'll be general and non-specific in some areas.

1365085418.0,125,self.poker,1bntyr,"In light of the ""just bet your flops"" post, a lot of misleading information was thrown around that I thought could use some clarifying.",jla88,139,14,90,http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/1bntyr/in_light_of_the_just_bet_your_flops_post_a_lot_of/,"After going through the comments in yesterdays post about c-betting, and how it will lead to easier decisions/ more profitable play, I decided that this post warranted a new thread. Warning: While I may be an experienced poker player, I am a reddit positing noob. So I apologize if the formatting of this comes out poorly, I just wanted to get my thoughts out there to help some of the misguided players out there. 

Edit: The concepts I cover within this post are by no means to be considered ""fully covered"". If you could learn everything you need to know about when to cbet flops or what opponents are best to bet against from a simple post, then poker would be a very solvable game. If enough people enjoy this post I will probably start doing something like this weekly where I can actually flush out a lot of these concepts, but for now, this is just a general summation.

So it seems that the general theme that was being pervaded in the previous post was that continuation betting will alleviate all these problems that arise from tight or passive play. The simple answer to this, is that it is **false**. I do agree to a large extent, continuation betting in general will set up more profitable plays in the future, while sometimes simply taking the pot down on the flop. But, as poker players, we should always avoid making blanket statements. Why should we avoid doing things like that? Well the simple answer is that every situation in poker is unique. While continuation betting (cbetting from this point on) may yield profitable results when we have AKss and the board comes out 883 vs. a tight player, it does not always yield the same results when we cbet the same board, with the same hand, vs a loose passive player. 

While the previous post had some good ideas within it, the OP does not go into specific detail as to why his plays are profitable. Whether this is simply laziness, or he thinks that r/poker is incapable of handling the information he may bring to the table, it is misleading and must be corrected (I'm just trying to save everyone a little money here). 

So, when exactly should we be cbetting flops? In order to answer this question accurately, we need to determine why it is that we are even raising in the first place. 
      
* For value: The main reason that we generally raise our hands in the first place is for value. This simply means that we either have a strong hand that is worth protecting, or that we are isolating a specific player(s) that is evidently playing a wider, more marginal range than our own. 

* To take an aggressive edge in the hand: This is the point that the OP in the previously stated thread was attempting to achieve. A lot of time in poker, you're going to win your hands simply because you have the aggressive edge. When I say this, I simply mean that you are the one applying the pressure via betting in order to cause our villains to fold. While this strategy is one that I, and many profitable players use, to simply say that by being more aggressive than your opponents, you will yield profitable results, is a fallacy. You need to understand **why** it is that you are betting, is it to take the pot down immediately because our opponent has a 75% fold to cbet, is it to set up profitable turn and river double or triple barrel bluffs, or is it for value when we are attempting to protect our hand from inferior hands that may be drawing to stronger made hands. 

* In order to exploit a weak player that is playing a marginal range, or has shown that they're capable of making call downs with marginal hands that our range dominates.

So, what makes a situation a good one in order to raise preflop **and** cbet the flop/turn/river? The easy answer is that it varies from hand to hand. No one in the poker world, whether it be Sauce123, jungleman, durr, ivey, ect, will ever be able to offer you simple blanket type advice that is going to bring your game to a new level. If that were the case, I would have simply stopped with ""cbetting is not always profitable"". But the point of this thread is to explain when and why it's profitable to cbet, or check.

* To retain the aggressive edge: This means that you are cbetting the flop mainly because your opponent tight passive, or has shown a predisposition to float flops lightly, but fold to double or triple barrels often. This is the advice that the previous thread offers, but it alone is not reason enough to always cbet. 

* For value: This idea is simple enough, you have a strong hand that warrants being protected, so you bet in order to charge weaker hands to see future streets. 

* To bluff: This is done because you have a marginal hand that has no chance of winning if the pot were to come to a showdown. This is slightly the other implication made by retaining the aggressive edge, but typically you hold less equity than you would in the first example.

* Flop Texture: There are certain flops that are specifically good for cbetting regardless of your hand because it is incredibly likely that the board didn't hit our opponents range. Boards like 622, 975, 443, are all boards that the opponent must either have weak holdings, or larger pocket pairs in order to continue. If our opponent open limps in middle position and calls our button raise, and the flop comes out 622, the only hands that they can call multiple streets with are hands like 77-AA, maybe AK/AQ, or KQ if they're really bad, and even those small pocket pair type hands are going to face a lot of heat when we double barrel a queen or ace turn. 

Those are a few reasons as to why we should be cbetting, but what about situations where we **shouldn't** be cbetting? 

* Playing vs loose/passive villains: These are the types of opponents that will limp K4o in early position (EP), and continue to check call down on A42QJ boards. You simply are never going to get these guys to fold. It doesn't matter if you fire 200bbs into a 10bb pot, these people just never had the fold button installed with their software, so they're not going to start folding simply because you're representing pocket aces. 

* You have a marginal hand: While on the surface, this concept seems simple enough, but it really is what separates a lot of winning from losing players. This concept also starts to delve into why the blanket statement of ""always cbet your flops"" is poor advice. An example of this is when you have 99 preflop, you have a limper in middle position, you isolate the limper (for value), he calls, and the flop comes out: QhJs3c. What do you do on this board? Do you simply cbet, and hope to take it down, or do you check and get confused about where you are in the hand? The answer is neither of these things. What you should be thinking about when attempting to determine whether a bet or a check is appropriate in this position, is what is our opponent representing? This concept is called applying ranges, and it is the basic puzzle solving mechanism that every single professional poker player takes in order to better determine what it is that their opponent is holding. In this example, a villain who is playing something like 14/9 vpip/pfr, their likely holdings are 22-TT/TJs+/AJo+, so applying this range to our board of QJ3, its safe to say that our opponent very likely got a piece of that board, and if we're still up against the same opponents that are calling down with K4o on the A42QJ boards, then you are simply bloating up the pot for them because they are never going to fold their hand that dominates yours. If you aren't using stat tracking software, then one way to figure out a persons range, is to watch what they bring to showdown. Did they limp pocket fours in early position, but raise pocket eights from the same position? Then you can assume if they limp in early position their range is now 22-77/TJs+/AJo+, ect. As soon as you start determine what villains do with specific hands, you can start to apply those hands to greatly reduce the range of hands they could be holding in any position. 

* You are playing against an aggressive opponent: This idea is one of the more difficult ones to employ because it implies that our opponent is a thinking player, like ourselves, and they understand that we are simply cbetting a lot of boards because people don't always connect with their ranges. These players will do things like check raise big to marginal draws on coordinated flops (I.E. boards like TJ9, KsTs3h). The reason this is profitable for them is because if they know that you are simply cbetting all of your hands after the flop, so they can start to exploit that to earn more money off of you where you would have checked in order to retain pot control under normal circumstances. 

* To retain pot control: This idea is practiced in order to keep pots small when the board comes out dangerously, but you have a decent hand that is probably good at showdown if it is only for 1-2 streets of value. An example of this would be having AsAc on an ThJh4s flop, you cbet, and the turn comes the Kh. Now there are multiple hands that beat you that only call on the flop. AQ, Q9, any hearts, KJ, TJ. Even if this is the first time seeing this concept, everyone knows that feeling, its the ""Oh m@$%&amp;*@ fu$%($*#, my aces just got cracked"" feeling. And it exists for a reason, because often times it's true. If poker were as simple as only playing AA, and better 3 street with it, then everyone would be profitable at poker. It's the people that recognize the dangers of a board, coupled with the implication of our opponents range, that inherently lose less money because they pot controlled the flop or turn in order to keep the pot smaller simply because the opponent cannot continue to call with worse. The inverse also applies, but takes a lot more skill and practice, and that is to know when to value bet your weak to marginal hands. The idea of betting for thin value only comes with experience/ practicing range reading, so I wont delve into that topic today, but once you're comfortable with all the topics above, it's certainly the way to bring your game to the next level. 

While cbetting a lot of flops may have been the bread and butter of poker players for many years, it is not 2006 anymore and the jig is up. Long gone are the days where you could apply blanket statements like that one and be a winning player at poker. I am not advocating weak passive play in this thread, I am simply trying to exemplify why it is not always profitable to blindly cbet our hands constantly. You need to know why you are betting when you are betting, otherwise you risk stagnating your own poker career. 

TL;DR It is not always appropriate to cbet boards, you need to learn to read flop textures, opponents ranges, and positional implications before you will know whether or not it is appropriate to cbet.

In order to stay sane, I have been occasionally documenting (trip report style) some of the major points along the way in my short past few years of going from low stakes to mid/high stakes.  I wrote them many months ago and I recently re-read this first one and thought it would be good to post.  So without further ado, the first trip report I wrote:

.


Preface

My life has generally been pretty boring, but these past few months are something worth writing about.  This first trip report is about me winning my biggest pot up to that date, $25K, and with just one pair.  I thought that this was a pretty wild night, and it was certainly momentous for me personally, but little did I know my life experience was just getting started.  Not soon after this, I'd lose $72K in an eight hour session of 100/200/400 HA after being awake for 2 days straight; shortly after that, I'd find out one of my closest friends had joined a cult; and the week after that, I'd wake up groggy, confused and alone in a “by the hour” motel in Tijuana.

.

Trip Report – Part 1:  Top Pair on the Turn [February 2012]

Our four-man team formed last year [2011] after the Series, each of us putting up a grand, and taking our combined $4,000 and just taking a shot at 2-5.  I had been a 50nl and 100nl grinder, another poker friend of mine had been a low stakes MTT grinder, and two others both worked for poker TV productions.  So after Black Friday, we were all four of us out of a job and trying to figure out what to do next.  Teaming up with that $4k was the best idea that we could come up with.  Not good mind you, just the best one we could think of.

The four of us ran hot at those 2-5 games early on, and since then we've managed to run it up to about $45K  in addition to taking out some money for living expenses.  Enough for us to be playing 5-10 regularly and taking shots at 10-20.  Coming from the world of post-UIGEA online 6-max, and playing micro stakes for a living without any other job prospects, I had always been very nitty in my bankroll-management.  My teammates have been slowly ingraining in my head the wisdom of aggressive shot taking and just generally finding a way to get out of a life of grinding, and it's finally beginning to kick in.

.

With $10K of the team's $45K on me, I'm now sitting at the Bellagio at about 1:00am, having gotten up for the day at about 9:00pm, in the second table of the 5-10 – a must move into the main game.  From my seat, I have a clear view “upstairs” on the 10-20 game that goes regularly, now with about 5 players.  I get up a few times and walk to the bathroom by the sports book—and the 10-20—scoping out the game from afar.  It looks pretty soft.  Aggro, but soft.  One guy in particular seems to be barreling 3 streets pretty frequently.  So when I get called for the main game, instead I head to the cashier and change up a rack of orange $10 chips to a few stacks of the brighter orange $20 chips, and sit in the 10-20 with $3K for my buyin, $2,000 in cash and two and a half stacks of 20's.

The second hand I manage to run AK into queens preflop in a straddled pot, run it twice, and whiff both boards.  So I pull out $3K more and decide this will be my last buyin.  I'm still pretty bankroll-nitty so losing $6K of $45K in a night is definitely pushing the envelope for me.  Lucking, I pretty quickly run TT into what I assume must be 99 or AQ from Mr. Aggro (the guy who had been barreling a lot when I was scoping the game out earlier), because when we run it twice, he mucks, and with the bottom board containing a king and the top board having a jack, eight and seven on it, I just can't figure what other possible hands he could have had.

Sitting on $6K and even for the night after that double-up, I manage to pick up a few pots and work up to $9K.  (It's 5-handed, straddled every pot, and fairly aggressive, so even small-ish pots have a grand in the middle, ergo grinding up $3K isn't that difficult of a task.)  Mr. Aggro, the guy who had been barreling a lot, had contributed about $1500 to my work up in addition to his 99/AQ hand, now has $6K left, and he proceeds to give it out across the table.  I play for a bit, perfectly happy to stay in this game even without him playing, but also happy to lock up my $3K win and take $9K off the table.  But after about a half hour, he comes back and sits down with six white $5K chips (which I soon find out are called “flags” because they're fucking impossible to actually cash out).  He changes two of them out, then two more, as he aggressively spews to the table.  I manage to “only” pick up $3500 more from him while he gets himself down to about $14K, with me happily sitting at about $12.5K, over six G's in profit.

.

Then the following hand occurs:

Mr. Aggro's in the sb, two to my right, and I put out the $40 straddle.  The mediocre cut-off player limps for $40, the button folds, and Mr. Aggro makes it $140 to go.  I have JcTs and 3-bet to $420 in order to isolate him and get HU in position.  The limper does indeed fold and Mr. A calls.  The flop is 8c7d2h and Mr. A leads out $900, almost pot.

His bets have been on the bigger side all night, and I didn't nickname him Mr. Aggro for nothing, so with 4 nut outs, two probable overs, position, and plenty of stack left behind, I opt to call.  (I felt if I raised, I open the door for him to jam, which was a real concern with this player.)  I manage to bink the Tc, not the nine I was hoping for, but a card that puts me well ahead on average.  He checks, and I decide to go for value against all of his possible worse pairs, overcards, and the myriad of straight and flush draws, and worse pair-plus-draws, and I bet $1600, a little under 2/3 pot.  I feel it's small enough where he can't jam, and also I can pick off a reasonable sized river bet without committing more than half my stack to the hand altogether.  A really good-sized bet I think.

He instantly check-raises to $3600, which is a pretty small raise even though it's 100 blinds for the game we're in, and $2,000 actual cash.  (Bear in mind last year I was grinding 50nl online, so this was definitely a step up...)

Well fuck.

I don't want to commit myself with the hand here, but as I'm tanking, I just can't put him on two pairs, sets, straights, etc. often enough to overcome the sheer number of draws and outright bluffs he might have.  And if I just call, the pot will be $10K, a perfect size for shipping $8K on the river into me.  I think Gus Hansen once (jokingly?) called the small blind the best position because it's the first one to bet.  As far as how the river is going to play out if I just call his raise, I think he's got it spot on.

And what am I going to do then when he jams the river, fold?  Clearly I can't do that.  I'm going to be good on the end well over a third of the time.

But if I'm just closing my eyes calling off, he can bet or not bet the river perfectly—my hand being somewhat face up—so theoretically every single action I can take on the river could be made to be wrong.  So calling is out.  And I've already decided that folding is out.  And with the pot as big as it is, that really only leaves the one option...

*600 big blinds—twelve thousand dollars—with top pair.*

I'm not initially fond about that prospect.

But the straddle, the 3-bet pot, the opponent— I must admit that top pair is looking better and better.

In goes the money.  If I lose, at least it's a fun giant pot to tell my friends about, and we're only $6K worse for the day.

Mr. Aggro tanks and tanks and eventually asks me if I'll run it twice.  Although I generally only run it once (to maintain fold equity), in this situation I decide some variance reduction is at hand, and I tell a lie— as calmly as I can, I answer that I always (“always” being the lie) run it twice, and no sooner than the word “twice” leaves my mouth is he moving his money over the betting line.

Well shit.  I was really hoping to take down the pot.

Oh well, hope I'm ahead at least.  I turn my JT over, he tables his A9o, we run the river twice, two beautiful blanks fall off, and I'm being pushed a $25,000 pot won with top pair.  With the g-ball I won at the 5-10 earlier, this puts my total net for the net at about $20K.  Mr. A leaves, and we play for about a half hour before it's pretty clear that the game is done without him, and we all rack up.  Always attempting to be the consummate professional, I manage to stay mostly numb to this turn of events and continue to play my game, but I do manage to [discretely snap a photo with my phone](http://i.imgur.com/0qOqUak.jpg).

I'm told the wait list for a box at the Bellagio is about 3 years, so I drive home to my $600 month-by-month “inn and suites” apartment with about $30,000 in cash, not really wanting to spend the extra effort to take the long walk and tram over to the Aria to put it in my box there.  It seems dumb when I say it that way, but only a few months ago, my car had broken down, and I didn't really feel I had the budget for a new car just yet, so I was regularly taking the 202 up and down Flamingo with $10K-$15K in my backpack— basically, my bar for doing dumb shit like carrying lots of money, was set pretty low to begin with.

(Poker money isn't money after all, right?  A carpenter can't just sell his toolbox after a job and expect to be able to work tomorrow.  Looking back on it, it does seem funny having that much cash on hand but still considering the $50 space heater I had to get a “big expense” — let alone buying a car!)

Anyway, like I said at the beginning, I thought that this was a pretty wild night, and it was certainly fairly momentous for me personally, but little did I know that my poker and life experiences were just getting started.  Not soon after this, I'd lose $72K in an eight hour session of 100/200/400 HA after being awake for 2 days straight; shortly after find out one of my closest friends had joined a cult; and the week after that, I'd wake up groggy, confused and alone in a “by the hour” motel in Tijuana.

The day after that, I was back in Vegas and ready to blow my brains out...",,False,,t5_2qhix,False,,,True,t3_194qfa,http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/194qfa/trip_report_1_top_pair_on_the_turn/,

Let me know what you think.,REInvestor,108,16,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/jrwjx/my_attempt_at_a_new_player_guide_beginners_guide/,"I felt like the new player guide could be better, so I put this guide together to hopefully make the learning path a little easier for new players. This is going to be mainly a collection of links to outside resources vs. straight exposition from me. I will rely very heavily on 2+2 because it's the nuts. If you disagree with anything I say, or if you think I should add a resource, please let me know. I will not be offended.

###Important Starting Concepts

* **You Suck...but so did everyone.** So maybe you do OK in your home game, or maybe you once won a freeroll, but I will lay 100-1 odds that you are actually terrible at poker. Yeah, there is an outside chance you're just a poker genius, but in all liklihood, you actually have no idea what you're doing and have simply gotten lucky so far. Right now, you just don't know what you don't know. Don't let your ego stop you from improving and don't be a victim of the [Dunning-Kruger effect.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) The rabbit hole of poker knowledge is so incredibly deep, that I could hardly believe it once I started studying.

* **[List of terminology and abbreviations](http://archives1.twoplustwo.com/showflat.php?Number=5988672).** There are some terms that are not covered. If you come across something you don't know, just google it along with ""poker"" and you'll find something that will help.

* **Where to play online.** For US players, pick a site from [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/jr1nj/live_in_the_us_and_want_to_play_online_here_are/). For everyone else, I would start on [Pokerstars](http://www.pokerstars.eu/). Before you sign up for any site, search for rakeback deals. Poker rooms make their money from the rake which is a percentage taken from each pot. Many online sites will pay you back a portion of the rake you pay if you sign up through special referrers. Not signing up will cost you real money in the short and long run.

* **Fundamental Theory of Poker**
Every time you play a hand differently from the way you would have played it if you could see all your opponents' cards, they gain; and every time you play your hand the same way you would have played it if you could see all their cards, they lose. Conversely, every time opponents play their hands differently from the way they would have if they could see all your cards, you gain; and every time they play their hands the same way they would have played if they could see all your cards, you lose. See [Theory of Poker](http://www.amazon.com/Theory-Poker-Professional-Player-Teaches/dp/1880685000/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1314114900&amp;sr=1-1) by David Slansky for more.

* **What Game to Play.** I would start in no limit (NL) cash games. Limit games are pretty boring IMO and pot limit omaha is a little too crazy for new players, but YMMV. Play the smallest stakes available until you are crushing it, then move up to the next stake level. Tournaments have way too much variance for a newbie IMO. Here is one [redditor's thoughts.](http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/9usse/cash_vs_sng/)

* **Pot Odds**. The math of poker is pretty simply until you get much farther along with analyzing equity against hand ranges, and even then, a lot of players don't even bother with it. Here is a good start on [pot odds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pot_odds). Here is [another article](http://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/32/beginners-questions/pot-odds-calculating-outs-rule-2-4-a-389150/) which covers the rule of 2/4 which is about calculating the odds of hitting your outs.

* **[Expected Value.](http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/facqh/can_someone_explain_to_me_what_ev_is_and_how_to/)**

* **Tilt.**
[Tilt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilt_\(poker\)) sucks. It is the bane of all poker players. The 2+2 anthologies below contain a lot of great strategies for dealing with. Please don't [stab yourself in the foot](http://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/54/poker-beats-brags-variance/14-000-downswing-masochism-hospital-tr-697958/) though.

* **[Variance.](http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/atb92/judging_by_many_of_the_posts_in_rpoker_lots_of/)**

* **Bankroll Management.** Stolen from icanhazstax: Bankroll Management - While solid poker players have an edge against their opponents, and this edge allows these individuals to make money over the long run, the short term with regards to poker can be very unpredictable. These short-term swings are referred to as Variance (positive &amp; negative variance). Due to variance, Bankroll Management is essential for anyone looking at poker from more than just an entertainment perspective. By following ""rules"" of proper BR management, and thus having enough buyins in your bankroll to stand the possible negative variance swings, one can assure the chances of them going 'busto' (losing their entire roll) is significantly decreased. While the number of suggested buyins can be debated, 'imo' the rule is something like: Cash = 20-30 buyins, STT = 40-50 buyins, MTT = 90+ buyins. See the anthologies for more.

* **Levels of Thinking:**

1st Level: Your cards

2nd Level: What does your opponent have

3rd Level: What does your opponent think you have

4th Level: What does your opponent think you think he has

5th level: What does your opponent think you think he thinks you have, etc.

At the micros, your opponents will almost all be level 1 thinkers. Don't get tricky; just play ABC poker. See [Brian's comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/jrwjx/my_attempt_at_a_new_player_guide_beginners_guide/c2encu5) down below for more discussion.

* **Thought Processes.** Every time you make an action, you need to know:

- The reason for your action.

- Why that actions beats the alternatives (check, fold, call, raise, shove, etc.)

- What your plan is for subsequent events.

Here is a [good example](http://archives1.twoplustwo.com/showflat.php?Cat=0&amp;Board=microplnl&amp;Number=11760459&amp;page=63&amp;fpart=1) of what you should aim your thought processes to be.

###2+2 Anthologies

This is just a start of what [2+2](http://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/) has to offer. Go to the site and click on the stickied threads for each subforum to discover a wealth of more information covering such things as Sit N Go tournaments, multi-table tournaments, pot limit omaha, and more.

These threads are for NLHE as that's the most common game, but most of these basic concepts will apply to almost all poker games.

* [Microstakes FR Concept of the Week Listing](http://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/78/micro-stakes-full-ring/concept-week-schedule-table-contents-397190/)

* [Beginner threads](http://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/162/best-two-plus-two/poker-strategy-information-new-beginner-players-638459/)

###Books

There are SO many good poker books out there. I have read a bunch, but that only represents a fraction of what's available. Here are what I think are super helpful books:

* [Harrington on Hold 'Em 1 &amp; 2](http://www.amazon.com/Harrington-Expert-Strategy-Limit-Tournaments/dp/1880685337/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1314113981&amp;sr=1-1).

###HUD Software

If you're going to be playing online with any sort of seriousness, using a heads-up display is tremendously useful and almost a necessity. The two best options are Holdem Manager and Poker Tracker 3. I am partial to HM, as I feel the software and interface have surpassed PT3. They both offer free trials, so maybe see what works for you.

Once you get your HUD established, you'll need to pick which stats. I would start with the following:

* Voluntarily put $ into the pot (VPIP) / Preflop raise % (PFR) / Aggression Factor (AF) / # of hands

and once you are comfortable with understanding those, you can start adding more such as:

* Steal attempts / fold to steal in the small blind (SB) / fold to steal in the big blind (BB)

* Continuation bet (cbet) flop / Cbbet turn / fold to flop cbet / fold to turn cbet

* 3 bet / fold to 3 bet / call 3 bet / 4 bet

There are plenty more stats that are very helpful, but don't go too crazy. It's easy to overwhelm yourself with info, and there are plenty of high stakes guys that only use a barebones hud.",,False,,t5_2qhix,True,,,True,t3_jrwjx,http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/jrwjx/my_attempt_at_a_new_player_guide_beginners_guide/,

After Black Friday, we pooled some of our money to play live, and managed to run it up reasonably quickly.  It's been stagnant since then because we've taken out living expenses, but we're still firmly entrenched in 5-10 and reasonably happy for the moment.  We met Jerry playing 5-10 in a small gold mine north of Los Angeles, the Ventura Player's Club, which has a regular uncapped 5-10 game with some of the nicest and most wonderful people you'll ever meet in your life.  They also happen to be terrible at poker.

Pretty soon after Jerry started playing at my table, he started to ask about me -- what stakes I play, my life in general, et cetera.  He casually asked if I ever play higher limits and I mentioned that no I wasn't really rolled for that.  After a few hours, he got up for a smoke break and asked me to come join him, where he proceeded to inform me that he runs a lot of private games around California and he makes money in them by staking good players, and he thinks I'm worthy of being staked.  The next night, he says, he has a 50-100 game up in San Francisco.  So I give all my team and personal money to my teammates (in case Jerry was trying to rob me), and I hop in the car with Jerry, who I'd just met.  I proceeded to lose $50K running second nuts into the nuts, and rode back to Ventura with Jerry two days later.  He didn't seem upset, and I had a very interesting addition to my normally boring life, so even though I felt bad, I was still pretty stoked.  It was an exciting past few days.

Jerry still wanted to continue to stake me, and talked to me and my teammates about getting us in his games.  Initially we were excited, but after months and months, we realized that these games only go very rarely.  They hinge on a few rich businessmen who often change their mind about what they want to do for the night -- and obviously it's poor business to let them know the games just don't go if they don't show up.  So I'm often running over to LA from Vegas on the slim likelihood of a game.  My teammate Jack lives in Ventura and he's managed to play a few of the bigger ones.  The biggest game he was in was 300/600 PLO held [at the house from this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDXmJ-AbE4Y) Charlie Sheen car commercial.  Jack won “only” $30K that night, having lost a $186K pot in a game with Ben Lamb, and with Ben and our staker Jerry flipping coins for $5K a pop.  (Literally, they were throwing quarters in the air.  True coin flipping).

We've always been in the red in these Jerry games, and they rarely go anyway, so as far as we are concerned, it's just funny money.  We've never been paid from them.  I don't actually even know Jerry's last name.  That being said, all we have to do is bink one good night and we're set—assuming we actually do get paid.  So we always have to be ready to go at a moment's notice for these games, even though we're still down overall.

We were only $25K in make-up when Jack got a call about this 100/200 game in San Francisco.

I was hot off a recent [$20K win at the Bellagio 10-20](http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/194qfa/trip_report_1_top_pair_on_the_turn/), and feeling pretty good just grinding 5-10 with a nicer cushion now, and happy I had finally been able to contribute to the team after being flatlined in my winnings over the past few months.  I was on an odd sleep schedule, so even though it was mid-day, I was in bed for the day... but I couldn't sleep, so I went to the Aria played 2-5 since the 5-10 didn't look very good.  I didn't want to scope out the Bellagio for the 10-20 because I was really tired (and also the Yellow Curry Chicken from Lemon Grass at the Aria is just too good to pass up).  I had been playing for a few hours when I got a text from Jack saying there was a Jerry game in San Francisco the next day, so I cashed out and tired though I was, I drove to LA.  Our teammate Corey was working, and the other teammate, Ben, had already committed himself to [some leadership seminar or something](http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/19mncj/daniel_negreanu_antonio_esfandiari_for_choice/c8pm4z9); therefore, I headed over to Los Angeles alone.

Books on tape are a good way to pass time, but Cormac McCarthy's *The Road* is a bit too much of a downer for focused, casual driving while already being sleepy.  So I was a bit on the tired and depressed side when I pulled into the Player's Club, but that wonderful 5-10 managed to perk me right up.

It was a good game.  In fact it was a REALLY good game.  Jack and I knew if the Jerry game went, we'd have to leave around 1 or 2 in the afternoon the next day to make it to SF on time; however, we estimated there was only about a 10% chance that that would actually happen, since the games always seem to fizzle out, so even though it was getting late now, and I hadn't slept in a long time, we kept on playing the juicy 5-10 game rather than get a good night's sleep.  At about 9:30am the next morning, the last player in the game quit playing Jack and me 3-handed, so we finally went home to sleep, somewhere around $5K in the positive for the night and pretty sure, since we hadn't heard anything, that the SF Jerry game would be cancelled.  At about 11:00am, Jack was banging on my door saying we need to leave.  The Jerry game is for sure going, and it's starting at five o' clock, not eight.  We need to leave right now.  Unshowered, and in our day-old clothes and half asleep, we make the drive up to San Francisco.

Groggy as we were, we still managed to have a fairly in depth discussion about Jack and Ben's very exploitative sense-and-pounce-on-weakness style versus my and Corey's closer to optimal board-texture-representing-with-the-right-frequency style.  Corey and I are both still learning how to maximally exploit our opponents and make the most money, but I continue to catch myself making certain plays in order to be balanced when doing so is completely unnecessary.  Yes, if my opponent was good, I should just raise here with most of my range, but he's terrible, so I can just flat here and even if the club does hit, he'll tell me whether or not he has it.  No, I can't make this river call, even though I put in so much money in on the turn -- he just always has it.  He's never bluffing, he just has it.

I don't like opening myself up like that, but it's clearly where the money is.  5-10 and 10-20 live (and 50-100, 100-200, and 300-600) are just miles softer than 100nl post-UIGEA online, and exploitative play is obviously the best for live games.

As we were about an hour away from San Francisco, I pulled out my phone hoping to find a truck stop or something that we could shower in, but we were cutting it too close already.  No time for showers.  So we just continued into the city and found a parking garage as close to the Fairmont hotel as we could.  We wondered how the hell they snuck a poker table into the suite we were going to play in, but Jerry's friend Sam, who was running the game, said that apparently they have private poker “parties” all the time, and the hotel loves to accommodate that.  So apparently he'd found a good permanent home for hosting his games.

After we had parked, we got out, and right there in the parking garage we changed clothes into more classy business-casual attire -- we did after all have to make like we were also rich businessmen.  I hoped piles of cologne and deodorant would mask my B.O. smell, and I stopped in the less-than-sparkling parking garage bathroom to wash my hands and run a comb through my hair.  As long as whatever stickiness was on the floor didn't manage to get on the TOP of my shoes, I felt like I might actually pull the charade off.  I'm more of a shorts, tee shirt, and flip flops guy myself, so this dress-up was kind of foreign to me.  But for a 50-50 split stake in a 100/200, I can find a way to live with it.  After I got out of the bathroom, I ran to the car to grab a few 5-Hour Energies, chugged one right there, and stuck the rest in my pocket.

The game itself was actually pretty uneventful.  Everybody bought in for $20K or so and we started out at 100-200 no limit holdem.  (Nobody brings cash to these things; it's just taken care of on a laptop spreadsheet, and then the host and the winners/losers settle up privately, usually just through check or bank wire.  This is another reason I said it feels like funny money to me—I've never actually seen the cash.)  The game was pretty soft, easily soft enough to beat the exorbitant 5% $200 max rake that finances the whole shebang, but I was not getting any cards, and pretty quickly re-bought, so I was sitting on $25K and in the game for $40K for a good chunk of the night.  It was a pretty boring game.  The only interesting hand was that Jack managed to bluff somebody off of a one card A-high flush convincing him that he had one of two possible two-card straight flushes.  Jack had air and just thought the guy's river raise was FOS.  (Later we found out that the guy was a “pro” friend of the main fish in the game, and was playing scared because he was being staked by the fish.  The fish doesn't know Jesse and Sam know this and let it happen because his “pro” isn't very good.)  Jack showed the bluff after the “pro” folded his ace face up and we all had a chuckle about it.

After that, everybody got card dead and the game slowed down for a while, so we agreed to mixed in a round of PLO, and then eventually also a round of PLO8.

PLO is approximately 4 times swingier than holdem per blind level.  This is because hand values are closer together equity-wise, so it takes more money being bet to determine where you are and narrow ranges to the same degree that you can in holdem.  It's also often correct to call off because you usually have a lot of equity, even when you realize you're behind.  This means that if you're not 600+ blinds deep, getting all-in is much easier and more common in PLO than in no limit holdem.  That fact, combined with everybody straddling for $400 made my losing another $20K seem completely normal.  Before I knew it, I was sitting on about $40K, but in the game now for a cool $100,000.

Once again, I slowly and uneventfully dwindled down to about $25K, but then a few people left, and we were stuck playing 4-handed with me and Jack, and Sam the host, and Mike, the main businessman fish of the game.  For whatever reason, we all agreed to switch the game back to just NLHE, and Jack and I began really eating away at Mike's chips.  Sam fairly quickly stopped the game when Mike had $10K left and looked ready to rebuy.  When Jack and I talked to Sam later -- fairly pissed about him stopping the game -- he explained that this particular fish was the type to get REALLY upset if he lost everything and not want to play for a few months, so stopping the game when he still had $10K was better for the long term interests of the game.  I'm suspicious of this, but if the man is going to give me $100K to play poker with and not come knocking on my door the next day when I lose it, he can do whatever the fuck he wants.

All told, I ended the night down $72K, and Jack up $7K, so adding that net -$65K to our already -$25K, we were now in the hole $90,000 for the Jerry games.  It sucks, but many people have had big six figure nights, so like I said before, it only takes one good night to make it all worth while.  Jack said that Mike Baxter spewed over a million in that 300/600 PLO game he played, so I'm hoping that sometime in the next few years, since these games only seem to go once every few months, we'll bink a good score.

It was about 2:00am and the game was over.  We were both dead tired, but Jack had previously made plans with his family for the next day, so he wanted to get home.  I took my last 5-Hour Energy and drove most of the way, giving him a chance to nap, and we pulled into his house at about 7:30.  He only got a few more hours sleep before getting up with his family, but I happily slept all day on their kid's bed while they were all out.  I'd been up for something like 3 days after all.

That night, I played in the Player's Club 5-10 again for a little bit and then decided to head back home to Vegas.  Jack pestered me to stay, because no games in Vegas are as juicy as that 5-10 game, but home is home, and I desperately needed some rest and relaxation.  A nice break.

Not soon after, I would wake up stranded at a Tijuana whore-house, contemplating killing myself.",,False,,t5_2qhix,False,,,True,t3_19p1n8,http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/19p1n8/trip_report_2_a_jerry_game_finally_goes/,

1368205821.0,92,self.poker,1e2ue2,Differences between live and online poker,CardCounter0,119,27,82,http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/1e2ue2/differences_between_live_and_online_poker/,"Part 1: The mechanics

Live poker is played with real cards and chips.  You have to look at your cards and remember them, they aren't constantly displayed in front of you on a screen.   Might seem trivial, until you see a flop come with two spades at a table filled with new live players, and everybody immediately checks their cards to see if they have spades, after which some have looks of disappointment and some are betting with a new gleem in their eyes.  This ain't gonna happen online.

You always have the whole betting with chips thing.  Online, you type a number or slide a bar, click, and you just bet $10.75.  Live you have string bets, single chip rule, misstacking chips, fake pumps, etc.  Online you also have numbers all over the place.  Each player's balance is displayed neatly in front of them, while live everybody has random stacks of chips (and you will have to notice that guy has two black chips sitting on top of that stack of red).  The bets are displayed as little number, not a string of chips spewed across the table that you have to count, and the total in the pot is another neat little number, not a massive scattered pile of chips that you should have paid attention to how much had been bet previously.  Nobody is going to tell you how much is in the pot in a live game.

So after you figure out the mechanics of how to properly bet and raise and once you get over the having to look at your cards and remember them, being able to look at other's while they look at their cards (can't do that online can you?), estimating player's chips stacks, and remember to keep track of what has gone into the pot -- you will probably notice that there are no numbers floating over the player's heads in a live game.  The fact that chuckle head across the table from you is playing like 40% of his hands?  You have to track and make a note of that yourself.  If you were busy on your cellphone tweeting your buddies about how lol soft live games are, you won't know that when you do get in a hand with chuckle head, there will not be a 45/5/5 floating above his head.  You have to keep track of who is loose, who is aggressive, and who never cbets with less than top pair.

Other things that happen in live games that are impossible online -- players act or try to act out of turn, cards inadvertently get exposed, people fold out of turn, the turn card gets dealt prematurely.  Never gonna happen online.

Okay, the mechanics can quickly be adjusted to, so now it is time for the actual play:

Part 2: The play.

The first thing you will notice is everybody limps.  People do not drive for an hour to a casino to fold cards.  They got two cards, maybe the flop might hit them, they are gonna limp.  After everybody limps, and they have thrown in some money they for sure aren't folding, which brings us to the second difference, preflop raise size.  The 2.5x online preflop raise is a joke.  In for $2?  Might as well call $20!  So for raises to mean anything, you have to raise 5xBB or more, and you are probably still going to get callers, since like I said, nobody comes all the way to the casino to fold cards.  So just because somebody raises $12, and is snap called by the next player, you shouldn't necessarily be throwing away your AQ, you probably aren't up against AA and KK.  You can also tone down your attempts to raise to isolate loose players, because everybody is loose, and you probably aren't going to isolate.  And you will probably be playing for a while before you get a chance to attempt to steal blinds, because like I said, everybody limps.

Despite the limping and large raises, 3betting actually means something live.  These players are passive.  They are not 3betting with 98s.  I sometimes chuckle over an online player assigning ranges to a live situation, ""villian 3bet I put him on a range of 66+, ATs, AJo ..."", no dude - he 3bet, it's QQ+ maybe AKs.  Also the range of 66+ is a joke in a live game.  Anything a live player will or won't do with 77, he is equally likely to do or not do with 44.  There is no range of 66+.  It is either 22+ or 99+ (or maybe 22+, 88/99+, QQ+ depending on the player).  If you ever get 4bet shoved on live, it's not JTs thinking about fold equity ... You better have AA because the other guy either has your other two Aces, or he has KK.

Could go into much detail about live play differences -- I will just add one more.

Flop c-bet.  With everybody limping, large preflop raises, etc.  It isn't unusual to see a pot on the flop of over $100.  First to act bets $25.  Hmmmm... thinks the online player, 1/4 pot bet that means ...""  No dude, that wasn't a quarter pot bet.  That was a bet of $25.  $25 is a lot of money, $25 buys a lot of beer.  Live players do not think in terms of pot size.  They think in terms of $25 is big bet, $10 is small bet ...  So on the river, a $75 bet into a $300 pot isn't lol snap call, it is wow that guy might really have something.

Maybe others can add more details...

I know this doesn't mean much to most of you. I've lost alot playing poker the last year. I don't know how bad my addiction is.. or even if it is an addiction but I really love the game, but can not afford to play. As a college kid the buy-in I was losing to even play 1/2 -2/5 ( a few hundred bucks) means a lot. I've easily lost $20,000 the last few years off and on. Constantly telling myself I could master this game.Working minimum wage that was alot for me. The last few months I was just saving to go to the casino to practice, but I can't afford that. I have other shit to pay for. I wanted to make it somehow...kept losing. Win a little. Lose way more. I starting skipping class to play. I haven't told anyone about how much I've lost. 

Anyway I know it could have been way worse but Im not gonna keep chasing my losses. I am just gonna stick with the self realization that I suck and poker isn't the life I even want. Its not worth the stress anymore. I should be out chasing girls and making money.

My new years goal is to to not chase this unrealistic dream of becoming phil ivey and to get a real job and graduate school.

1371963898.0,80,self.poker,1gw82w,Poker ABC's: How To Analyze A Hand,Protential,98,18,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/1gw82w/poker_abcs_how_to_analyze_a_hand/,"There seem to be very few posters on here who know how to analyze a simple hand. The majority of posts amount to ""I would do this...blah blah blah, I hate/love draws/2p/JJ/AK/etc"" and don't actually provide much info on what might be the best play. 

Yes, your analysis might be correct to some degree, but when you just give some kind of half-assed bullshit answer that is vague in a somewhat complex spot and don't back up any of what you say, it is both difficult to take you seriously and also tough for others to learn. (which is why some people post here, specifically hands)

Thus I am going to write up a short and simple guide on how to break down hands, and how to prove whether or not a decision is correct or not using very basic math and one of the most useful tools in poker; ""PokerStove"". 

I am going to build a hand and take you step by step of how I get to the conclusion of whether or not we played the hand correctly in a simple spot. 

**The Situation.**

9 Handed tournament. Blinds are 50-100, 10k stacks around the table. 

Hero is Delt On the Button:

[](/As) [](/Ks)

*Folds to Hero who raises to 3bb, sb calls, bb calls.* 

**Step 1:** Figure out their Pre-Flop ranges. (This is done by guessing what type of players they are and estimating what hands they might flat/3bet with). 

This is by far the easiest and one of the most important parts of playing a hand, knowing what kind of hands villains will call/3bet/etc with pre-flop. Knowing what they start with helps immensely with breaking down their ranges post flop. 

Lets say in this spot that both villains are fairly loose passive out of the blinds, and play straight forward (will 3bet most of their value hands). 

Thus both of their ranges might look like this:

(To build these ranges I pulled out PokerStove and put in hands a loose passive player might call with)

SB:TT-22,AJs-A2s,K8s+,Q8s+,J8s+,T8s+,97s+,87s,76s,65s,AQo-A9o,KTo+,QTo+,J9o+,T9o,98o = 24.6%

BB:TT-22,A2s+,K5s+,Q6s+,J7s+,T7s+,97s+,86s+,75s+,64s+,54s,A2o+,K7o+,Q8o+,J8o+,T8o+,97o+,86o+,76o,65o = 45.1%

**Step 2:** Figure out what kinds of hands will continue vs us on the flop, whether or not we are betting for value or not, and how their range may shift based on whether they call or raise us (Much of their range that hits the flop will only fold, sometimes fold, call, sometimes call, only 3bet or sometimes 3bet). 

Now lets say that the flop is:

[](/Ac) [](/7s) [](/8s) 

*Both villains check to us.* 

To figure out whether or not we should bet, and whether or not our bet is for value, or as a bluff, we use PokerStove to look at how our hand does vs these ranges, what % of their ranges hit, and how well our hand does vs hands that continue vs us. 

I'd assume that for these kinds of players, this kind of range might continue: 

AJs-A2s,KsQs,KsJs,KsTs,Ks9s,QsJs,QsTs,Qs9s,JsTs,Js9s,T9s,8c7c,8d7d,8h7h,65s,AQo-A4o,T9o,87o : 14.5% of hands.

Thus SB will continue 14.5/24.6 (59%)  and BB will continue 14.5/45.1 (32%). 1 person will continue 72% of the time. (0.41 x 0.68 = 28% both fold) 

Vs the above range AKs has 80% Equity. Because 1 person will continue a lot vs us, and we crush their range, we can bet somewhat large here for value.

*So into a pot of 900, I would bet 650.* 

**Step 3:**Have a plan based on how well we do vs their ranges, whether we get called or 3bet, and have it be able to adjust based on how our equity might change due to various turn cards. 

*Out of simplicity's sake we will state that sb folds, and bb calls us.* 

Now that we have seen their actions, we can build a range that continues vs us in this manner, which might look like:

AJs-A9s,A6s-A2s,KsQs,KsJs,KsTs,Ks9s,Kc8c,Kd8d,Kh8h,QsJs,QsTs,Qs9s,JsTs,Js9s,8c7c,8d7d,8h7h,6c5c,6d5d,6h5h,5s4s,AQo-A9o,A6o,T9o

AKs has 86% Equity vs this range. 

The Turn: [](/6h) 

The above range has 33% equity vs us on this turn, nearly all of it will call another bet, of the 8.4% of total hands that will continue, only 1.6% (18% of the range) is ahead of us. Vs this kind of player, if they raise us on the turn, we can assume that they caught up/have us crushed, and vs the hands that do so, we have only 23% Equity (A6, 910, 45ss, 78s).

Thus as pretty much all of their range is continuing and as it has a lot of equity vs us, we can bet large once again. And as villain is fairly loose-passive, if we get check/raised large we can comfortably fold, while if they check/raise us small we can peel and hope we hit a K/s. 

*Hero bets 1500 into a pot of 2200. Villain Calls.* 

**Step 4:**Figure out what part of their range will react in what manner, so we may decide to value bet and call a raise, value bet and fold to a raise, or check behind. Also, understanding what part of their range will react based on sizing is fairly important as well vs more competent players. 

As villain called us on the turn, we can take out nearly all of their strong value hands. Thus going into the river their range might look like this:

AJs-A9s,A5s,KsQs,KsJs,KsTs,Ks9s,QsJs,QsTs,Qs9s,JsTs,Js9s,98s,6c5c,6d5d,6h5h,AQo-A9o

River:   [](/7h) 

*Villain checks to us. Hero bets 3000 for value.* 

Here is why: 

As villain is loose passive, they will almost never c/r us as a bluff, if villain was good, we could lean twards betting really small and hope we induce a jam, but as villain is not we should purely be betting here to get calls. Based on their above range, nearly all of their range is Ax or a busted draw, with a couple 98/65 type hands, thus a lot of their range is semi-weak value (bad top pairs) and will call a fair sized bet as a bluff catcher, however as much of it is fairly weak, we don't want to scare them off by betting too large.

When we bet  I'd expect to get called by:

AJs-A9s, A5s, AQo-A9o. = 4.5% of hands, or around 65% of the time based on their river range. 

**Results:**

**DON'T FUCKING MATTER.** (For a single hand)

If you have any thoughts/concerns/suggestions on things I can add to this to make it easier to follow/read, or if a mod would like to edit it for grammar/etc feel free to do so and give me your thoughts. 

Thanks!/You're Welcome!

Edit: Pertaining to results. For a single hand, the results don't matter. Over the course of many many hands the results do matter as it helps us construct our ranges more accurately. For instance, if villain had 77 here and called our river bet and we lost, that doesn't mean I'd always include sets in their flop/turn/river calling ranges, I might have 1/5th of possible set combos to compensate a bit for it, and add in more combos if they continue to show up with sets in the future in this kind of spot. 

Being able to accurately construct ranges and adjust them based on how the board changes and who your villain is, is the most important aspect of being able to play post flop poker.

At 2:31am, the tilt fairy comes and makes you think it's a good idea to play higher stakes... 

Rule 2: There are 12 heads-up tables and all of them have only one player.  This is not an invitation. This is a warning. 

Rule 3: Your set of aces on the flop will not hold up in 5-card Omaha. 

Rule 4: If you are dealt a 732A badugi, and your opponent draws 4, 3, and 2 cards on each of the betting rounds, and check-raises after the third draw, he has a 6. 

Rule 5: We don't know how he does it, but when /u/HookDragger completes with a King of Spades on 3rd st. in Razz, he's dragging that pot. 

Rule 6: Every player has a tell.  My tell is that whenever I have the nut low with no high on the turn, a deuce comes on the river. 

Rule 7: Your opponent's hand will shake if he's got a big hand, a big bluff, or Parkinsons. 

Rule 8: It is impossible to practice BRM with bitcoins.  Your 0.001/0.002BTC game just went from ""micro stakes"" to ""small stakes"" to ""high stakes"" and back to ""micro stakes"" as you were reading this. 

Rule 9: Semi-bluffing with a flush draw is only profitable if your opponent will occasionally fold bottom pair. 

Rule 10: There is no correct way to play pocket jacks. 

Rule 11: Position is everything.  You want to be sitting to the ~~left~~ **right** of tight players, to the ~~right~~ **left** of loose players, upwind from smelly players, and across from thin players so that you can see the TV.  

Edit: *Collarary 11a: Do not post online after 2:30am.  You say left when you mean right, and right when you mean left.*

Rule 12: You can beat the rake, but you can't beat the rake, the flight, the hotel...

Rule 13: When you find yourself dominated by a better kicker, remember the safeword: ""Fold."" 

Rule 14: Sometimes a -EV chop is +EV when you figure in that you just don't want to sit there at the table another three hours waiting for the other guy to shove or blind themselves out. 

Rule 15: Impress new players by name-dropping other poker variants than Holdem, such as Stud, Razz, Badugi, and Omaha.  Impress experienced players by not name dropping *stupid* poker variants like ""circle holdem,"" ""pass the trash,"" and ""roll your own stud.""  Rule of thumb: If you can win a bracelet in it, it's not stupid.  Exceptions to the above rule of thumb: ""Badacey,"" ""Razzdugi,"" and ""Courcheval""

For those who are relatively new, here's a brief history of /r/poker:

* Long, long ago, a user called [steveoola](/u/steveoola) created /r/poker. Then, he promptly disappeared, never to come back. And /r/poker existed, but there were almost no subscribers and no moderators.
* Slowly, a bit of a community developed, and we had interesting submissions, and discussions.
* [ibarg](/u/ibarg) realised it would be nice to have some moderators, and he petitioned the reddit administrators to make him a moderator of /r/poker. And they did.
* ibarg made a thread asking for nominations for more moderators, and then made a few more people moderators.
* Someone made us some awesome CSS that let us have card images and a neat logo (pocket reddits!). But I can't remember who! ([protell](/protell), perhaps?!) Someone please let me know so I can get this right!
* Then slowly we grew, and things were good.
* (Of course, eventually we started running into the problems that larger subreddits have: spam, assholes, memes, black friday, but generally I think we get along okay. Reddit is still a much better format that *many* other social media sites.)

So, now, why don't you all share your memories? How did you find /r/poker. How has it changed since you found it? What events do you particularly remember?

My name is Jack Bates.  I don't believe that privacy exists any longer, and I've ""decloaked"" several times under this moniker.

I was a software engineer for both UltimateBet and Full Tilt Poker.  Amongst other things, I wrote the RNG and shuffling logic for both sites.  I'm happy to host a Q&amp;A session on this topic.  I will also answer questions about the scandals at these sites.

Ask Me (Almost) Anything!

EDIT: I am surprised that no one brought up the subject of modulo bias.

EDIT: I hope that everyone is enjoying my public interview with Scott Bell.

EDIT: Haley Hintze dropped by, and reminded me that I'm an FBI informant in the the matter of the UB cheating scandal:

EDIT: 2013-03-18: Without solicitation, Haley Hintze has apparently started a blog series about my experiences in regards to the investigation of the UB cheating matter:

EDIT: I realize that I had misidentifed George Marsaglia as the author of the ISAAC PRNG.  Actually, Bob Jenkins wrote ISAAC.  George Marsaglia wrote the diehard suite of random number generator analysis tests.  George died in Feb 2011 of a heart attack.  RIP, George, and thank you for your rigorous work in this realm of applied math.

EDIT: After spending some time on the wayback machine, I found the statement that I wrote in regards to UltimateBet's RNG and shuffling algorithm when I was an employee of ieLogic, in Portland, Oregon.  Here it is:

1) What books should I read? 

2) I'm going to Vegas, where should I play? 

3) Guys, like my royal flush? LOLOL.

Then, when someone offers constructive criticism to the few and far between HH posts, the replies often resemble ""Oh, well, you have some very nice points here and here, but I disagree with this one point you made, so let me reply only to that one and ignore the real meat of what you just said"". 

Not to mention the issue of unskilled players being very vocal about their opinions (down-voting those that disagree with them and refusing to ever LEARN anything. You get good at poker by realizing you suck. Stop pretending you're a God.) This is particularly hard because I can spot people who are probably giving bad advice only because I have a large skill advantage on that particular subject. How do I get advice from someone at or above my skill, when I certainly can't tell the difference between good and bad? 

I am not butt-hurt for upvotes. In fact, I rarely get down-voted into oblivion. And I'm not saying there aren't good posters on here - there are. But I'm starting to get really pissed off at a lot of this stuff. We can do so much better, and I think the reason we have few players with long-term success in poker, is because they are tired of this shit and just went to TwoPlusTwo. I know I'm getting close to that point.

Some of you may remember a [post I made almost three years ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/dmltv/five_weeks_ago_i_quit_my_job_and_started_playing/) after quitting my job to make a run at full-time poker. I was relatively inexperienced, and definitely under-rolled for the endeavor, but I ran well early on and so I never had to go get a job. Six months after I took that plunge, I posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/fpwmy/what_ive_learned_in_6_months_of_professional_play/). Recently u/Ryanlynn2004 ran across my six-month update (which is now 1.5 years old) and asked for a more current one. This is that update.

I still play poker as my primary income. I’m almost three years into it, and have somehow been able to successfully support my wife, myself, and our three children by playing low- and mid-stakes cash games.

**What I Enjoy**

Freedom and flexibility are by far the biggest benefits of playing for a living. I answer to no one. Not clients, not a boss, not customers. No one. And I love that. I don’t know very many people with fewer restrictions than we have. Since we educate our children at home, we can take a trip with no notice at all, and we’ve done so quite a few times. Pick a destination with a poker room nearby, and pack up the car. I took my family to Florida three times last year, and that’s where I am now. We’ve also been on ski trips on a week’s notice, and I never have to miss a kid's baseball game or track meet because of work. When a tornado tore through my hometown last month, I was able to take time off from poker and volunteer with the recovery effort; I didn’t need to call anyone and get permission.

The game itself is still fairly enjoyable, especially when I’m really reflecting on my play and pushing myself to *play poker* instead of robotically just go through the motions. Even though I end up spending a lot of time with some people I don’t care for, that would probably be the case at most jobs. And these guys are, for the  most part, there to have fun, so if you can put up with old man jokes and a few egos, the social aspect is fine. I’ve made some good friends through poker — dealers, other regs, even the waitress that always cheers me up when I’m running bad.

The money is also nice. I never made much money outside of poker (since I was a PhD student living on fellowships, and working part-time jobs to supplement), and the money I make playing poker isn’t making me rich. But it’s more than I could make doing anything else I’m qualified for. How much is that? YTD hourlies are ~ $165 for PLO (**EDIT** I have a statistically insignificant number of hours for PLO), $63 for $2/5 NL, and $89 for $5/10 NL. I’ve played a little 1/2 NL as well, mostly waiting for other games to open or when I want to socialize with friends at 1/2 games, and I’m at $34/hr in those games over the last 18 months. Last year I made a little less than I am this year at $2/5 NL, but I think I’m playing better now. The samples are so small in live poker that it’s impossible to really draw any big conclusions from hourly rates over six months or a year, so I won’t pretend that it’s significant. I included it because I thought people would be curious. I play a few tournaments when larger series come through town, but I don’t travel to play tournaments.

Finally, poker has made me a better person. I know that sounds ridiculous on the face of it, but the bad beats, variance, and bad runs have had a very positive influence on my emotional control and ability to adapt to bad news away from the table. Refrigerator breaks? I lost two refrigerators on the river yesterday. Car needs a big repair? I bluff-caught yesterday for that amount. The ups and downs of poker have made me much more even-keeled, and it’s pretty tough to upset me now; my work on my mental game, tilt control, and emotions at the table have no doubt spilled over into my personal life and my other competitive endeavors.

**What I Don’t Enjoy**

Even though I spend lots of time with my kids, volunteer with a couple of organizations, and have a strong marriage to my best friend, sometimes I feel like I’m wasting my life playing poker as much as I do. This is probably a feeling I would have trapped in a cubicle, or maybe even if I’d gotten an academic job. But poker seems even more pointless than being a tiny cog in a large corporate machine. At least that corporate machine produces something; I don’t. Poker no doubt enables me to do some great things (like travel, be with my sick kids, and have time to dedicate to important other projects), but poker itself doesn’t seem to count as doing anything at all. I try to counteract that by spending my time away from the table living well and being productive, but we Americans seem to put a lot of stock in our professional lives.

Obviously, I get tired of the bad poker humor, the old man jokes, the inane conversations, etc. But there’s some analogue to that at any job around other people. I think I witness more blatant sexism and racism playing poker than I would at most jobs. That pisses me off. Just yesterday I heard one of the most racist conversations at the poker table, as an old man lamented his daughter’s choice in husbands. He justified his racism with, “My granddaughter is mixed, so I can say this…” And then he repeated every negative stereotype in the book. Then he said his granddaughter is lucky that she won’t be around all that “nigger shit” because her father died last year. Seriously, my jaw hit the table and I was speechless. That’s an extreme example, obviously, but I don’t think I’d hear that sort of thing at most traditional jobs. And if I did, I guess at least complaining to HR would make me feel a little better.

**EDIT**

I deleted a section at the end that didn't seem to add much, and I'm adding a few things that I forgot:

I had the chance to join a family business about a year ago. It included a decent salary and benefits, so it was a real test of whether I wanted to keep playing poker. If it had been local, I may have taken the job, but it would have required moving, so the combination of moving, entering a business I wasn't excited about, and losing the freedom I have made it a pretty easy decision, so I passed on it.

Also, I forgot to mention that I have started doing a little poker coaching. It hasn't been as consistent as I'd hoped; poker players are pretty finicky when it comes to committing to coaching. My students see success and then decide they've learned everything they need to know, so they bail. It's also tricky to find students in the player pool that you're making a living off of. It's nice to make a small side income, but I don't think coaching, for me, will ever be more than that.

Also, we didn't tell our families that I was playing for a living for over a year. Partly it was because it *was* sort of an experiment, partly it was because I was still on the job market for academia, and partly we feared negative reactions. Once I decided to give up the academic job search, we told everyone. By that time it was pretty difficult for them to tell us we'd go broke since I had a year under my belt. I still didn't enjoy that conversation with my father-in-law.",,False,,t5_2qhix,1372427164.0,,,True,t3_1h8ryh,http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/1h8ryh/update_on_my_life_in_poker/,

At river show down after opponent turns over the nuts, look at your cards, look at the board, shake your head, then look at your cards again.  Lift your cards in the air and make waving motions with them like you are going to fold, but do not release your cards.  Pull them back and show them to your neighbor on the right so he can share in your misery.  Look intently at the board again.  Show your cards to your neighbor on the left.  Then FINALLY slowly slowly slide your cards forward face down to fold, but pull them back at the last instant to give one of your cards a last quick peek.  Look at opponents unbeatable hand.  Look at the board.  Then slowly slowly slide cards face down again while making a tsk-tsk-tsk sound with your tounge and shaking your head.  Works best when you have complete trash, that should have been folded preflop in the first place, and ended up with bottom pair and a busted gut shot draw.

**The Everlasting Show Down.**

Stare at each other.

""If you got the flush, you beat me.""

""I don't have the flush.""

Stare at each other. 

Turn over one card, revealing top pair.

Other player turns over one card, also revealing top pair.

Stare at each other.

""How big is your kicker?""

""Not very big, how big is your kicker?""

Stare at each other.

""I've only got a medium kicker"" 

Stare at each other.

Finally show other card - a ten kicker.

Other player looks at revealed hand, looks at board, and stares at other player. 

Then he slowly turns over his remaining card, showing Trips.

-----------------

.

   My path to learning poker started with my grandfather.  When I was in junior high and high school, whenever he came to visit us up in Seattle, he would talk about his visits to Las Vegas—how he got free rooms and great treatment and so forth—and he always claimed that he never lost nearly enough to justify such treatment.  Of course I didn't believe him; everybody thinks they aren't the ones powering the lights, but alas the house edge always catches up to them.  Still, after some discussion, for a Christmas present he sent me a book he claimed would prove his case to me, a book by some mathematician from the 60's or something, a guy named Edward Thorp.

   I finished that book that night, and in one fell swoop, the understanding of expectation in gambling, and the nature of counting cards at blackjack was a revelation to me.  I always knew the casinos won money because they paid less than the true odds of the events, but it had never occurred to me that this advantage might fluctuate around, even towards the player at certain points.  I soon devoured everything I could in all of the blackjack circles, even taught myself the Hi Opt II count, and after my high school classes were over for the day, I would occasionally run over to a nearby Indian casino and place minimum bets and practice counting.  I also started looking at other games—I found out about physical defects and biases in roulette, attempts at semi-control over the tossing the dice in craps, optimal play at full pay deuces wild video poker, and many other games—but blackjack was always the game I liked.  I had heard about poker, but never got much into it.

   When I got rejected from USC and UCLA—undeterred and still wanting to study film, I looked up other universities in the country and found out that the University of Nevada in Las Vegas had a reasonably good film school—and even better, they had a 2.0 GPA requirement, no essay, you could apply online, and registration was open until the first day of school... jackpot!  While my parents weren't thrilled about it, it was still a university, and I'd be in college in the fall, so they begrudgingly agreed.  My mom wasn't thrilled when she dropped me off at school and read in the school paper an op-ed piece by s student-stripper complaining about potential legislation to make even non-alcoholic strip clubs hire 21+ year olds instead of 18+ because how else was she going to pay for college?

   Despite their intense reservations, somehow, my parents left me there and let me go to school in Las Vegas.  About half way through my first semester, a kid in the dorm across from me mentioned that some people he know were playing a dorm poker tournament, and he thought I'd like to know since I'm so into gambling.  Even though I never learned poker, I decided to throw $20 in for the tournament, and without even really knowing what the rules were, I luck-sacked my way into a win, a whopping $140 from the two table tourney, and I was hooked.  Even though I had no idea what I was doing, it was still immediately apparent to me that poker contained all the good aspects I liked about gambling, but much more fluidity and psychology than any other casino games I'd studied—and I was smart enough to realize that this meant there was much more room for differing choices and decisions, and whenever there are more choices to be made, there are more rooms for people to make the wrong choice, and with such disparity, large edges can be had.

   Aside from my courses, the majority of my time in college was spent getting better at poker, more specifically, at no limit holdem cash games.  This was easy at first, because in 2003-2006, money was pretty much raining from the sky on Party Poker, and logging on and making a few hundred or even a thousand or more, both at the cash games, and at the 10-hand-per-level sitngos, was ridiculously easy, and although I didn't know photoshop, a simple cut and paste of my birth year in MS Paint was good enough to pass their ID verification.  While my parents weren't thrilled about my part time job of gambling, they couldn't deny that somehow it was working for me, and I wasn't taking out credit card debt or needing money from them.  When I graduated in 2007, I went back home to Seattle, I had planned to leave poker as a side hobby and get a job at Microsoft or Boeing or something.  My parents had always instilled in me that all you had to do was get a degree and then getting a job was super easy, so even though I had an essentially worthless degree in film production, having had no experience searching for a job, I had no reason to think they were wrong.

   Six months of job searching later, and I was getting very depressed.  I was living with my mom, unable to find work, and I felt completely worthless.  Even though in Washington state it was a Class C Felony on par with sexual assault, I continued to play online poker at night for something to do and to keep my mind off of being a miserable failure.  (It's actually only a felony if you play “as income”, and nobody's been prosecuted.)  Six months of job searching turned into almost two years, and I was going to therapy for depression and frequently contemplating suicide.  It was also frustrating my parents who also believed that I should have been able to find a job, and when my mom said I should work at McDonald's to at least have SOMETHING, I finally snapped and decided that if I was going to fail like this, I was going to go down fighting.  I was going to go to the place I was happy and the place that had kept me going through college, and I was going to do the only thing I had ever known to make money.  That night I cashed out my $1000 of my $3000 balance on Full Tilt, and the following week when it got in my bank account, I got a ticket back to Vegas.  I was going to grind online, maybe also play 1-2 live, and if I busted, well, there was always that final selfish out I could take to at least stop feeling so  miserable.

   I found some old college friends who had an extra room for rent in a cheap house, and even though it wasn't the greatest accommodations, it was $300 a month + 1/3 utilities, so even accounting for food, I could survive on less than $700 or $800 a month.  This was in April 2009, and although I lived in Las Vegas, I was spending my time grinding 50NL 6-max online, and by god I was treating it as a profession.  I made sure to get my fat ass out and go for a walk or light jog every day, I played in 2-3 hour spurts, then took a short break, then put in another session, I reviewed my hands in Poker Tracker at the end of every day, and even as broke as I was, I paid for a coach for few lessons per month at $100 a pop, each lesson $50 an hour for 2 hours... and I put in a minimum of 30,000 hands per month.  I can't mass-table or 8-table Rush, and I get burnt out sooner than most, so I can't put in 6 figures of hands like a lot of people apparently can, but I was managing to cover my costs and even save up a few hundred every month.  And with the light exercise, the paying my on way and standing on my own two feet, and the endless sunshine day after day in Vegas (as opposed to the endless clouds in Seattle), I was actually feeling really good about life, even though I wasn't really moving forward.

   I had also taught myself to deal poker, and was deciding whether or not to apply to deal the 2011 WSOP.  Despite being the biggest poker event every year, it's also the primo break-in job for new dealers, because they just need 1000 people every year, and nobody who's decent at dealing is going to leave their good paying job for a two-month stint that doesn't pay well.  So when Black Friday hit on April 15th, I did two things—I went to the last audition for dealing they held at the Rio (and passed!)—and I started looking up ways to get around the restrictions for US players.  I also found out that a poker friend of mine was apparently contacted by a guy representing Bill Chen, Jerrod Ankenman, and Matt Hawrilenko, to test a winner-take-all sitngo strategy they had developed.  (One which, having seen it, I think could easily just be spit out by Sit N Go Wizard.)  So even with Black Friday, I had a job lined up and I was also being staked for the STT's in the Series.

   With the money I had saved every month grinding 50NL, the money made from the sitngos, and the money I made dealing, after my expenses, I was still sitting on over $10k at the end of the Series, and really thrilled to death about it.  I'd been living very cheaply for over two years, and having a bankroll of $10k was a big deal.  Some of my poker friends who were also now out of work thanks to Black Friday came to me with a suggestion that we each put up a grand, and we take that combined $4K and just take a shot at 2-5 and see where it would lead.  With more money than I'd ever had, I was balling and eager to do it, and in fact we ran like god early on and were soon regularly playing 5-10 and taking shots at 10-20.  We'd drive over to LA and play at the Commerce, and drive down to San Diego and play in the Ocean's 11 juicy $1500 buyin 5-5 and stay a few nights in order to get in on their recurring Tuesday and Friday 10-20, and some of my other poker buddies, my close friend Tim and his friend J.J., would occasionally meet me in San Diego, play the 5-5, and then hop down to Tijuana with me.  By mid- 2012, our roll was over $100k and we were all playing 10-20 for the past few months or so [until the team broke up], and crushing it.  We were even staked for occasional high stakes home games, although we were running pretty bad in those—but all it would take is a single good night, and we could potentially get a 6 figure payout from our backer.  All in all, being a traveling poker pro, playing in high stakes games, getting sexy times with hookers—this was the high life as far as I was concerned.  I have always been very introverted and awkward, and the poker table is still the only place I feel in complete command, and this lifestyle was both exciting and very VERY new to me.

   So I was very upset to learn that it looked like our team might be falling apart.  Ben was committing more and more time to something called the Choice Center, which it looked to us was bordering on a cult.  He had entirely new friends, was hardly putting in any time at the tables, and was just generally going off in an entirely different direction.  Jack had moved to Ventura and was money hand over fist dealing at the same Ventura Player's Club that was our own private gold mine for a lot of our bankroll increase, and he also had his own private staking offers from the people there who had seen all of us play and had also gotten to know him personally and see that he's a trustworthy guy.  Corey wanted to spend more time with his family and these frequent trips to California were really making life difficult at home.  It seemed that I was the only one who really wanted to keep the team going.  And on top of it all, we'd been running bad recently and the roll was back at about $70K.  This meant if we split up, I'd have $17.5K as my share—enough to play $2-5, but by no means enough to continue sitting on my throne at the 10-20 and living the high life.

   So I was pretty depressed when we all reconvened in San Deigo for one last hurrah at the Ocean's 10-20, and I was very happy to find my friends Tim and J.J. sitting in the 5-5 game.  My team ended the session Saturday $6K in the hole, after Corey lost a $12K pot with a set versus a gutshot+flush draw getting in on the turn, so when we finally parted ways, my share of the roll was $16,000.  I was feeling really down, since the team was not only the “high life”, they were also my closest friends next to Tim.  Luckily for me, Tim and J.J. had a really great idea for curing depression and we hopped in the car and headed for the border.

-------------------

.

   It took a lot of time for me to recover from that and integrate back into a normal life.  I still haven't fully recovered.  To this day, I still bring my backpack with me almost everywhere, because in the back of my mind I need to know that I can take care of myself and escape if I need to.  When Tim came back into town, he was very apologetic.  He knew I had already been depressed about the team, and he felt terrible for being a catalyst of my break down.  I knew he didn't know how bad off I was, and that he meant no harm, and we're still close friends.

   Even though I'm not in a super dark place any more, I'm still definitely not in the best of places.  I've been playing much less the past half year or so, and I've been spending far too much time doing nothing with my life but browsing reddit and being a reclusive hermit.  My roll is at about $13K now, and since I no longer have the team for backup, I've reverted back to my old bankroll-nit ways.  I'm playing 1-2 live with occasional shots at 2-5, and playing 0.50/1 on Stars and 10-20 on Seals With Clubs, about the equivalent of 100nl at current bitcoin exchange rates.

   I didn't post this for a while, because it's so personal, and I'm both depressed about my life, and also ashamed about revealing that I'm no longer the high stakes baller I once was.  But in the past few weeks, I've managed to get my head on a little firmer, and pull myself back from the depths of despair, and I feel that part of my return to my former glory must be openness and honesty.  It's been a wild few years, and I'm grateful for the immense life experiences I've had along the way.  I genuinely feel like an old hand in the poker world, as silly as that may sound.  And despite being back at low limits, I am confident my NLHE game is maybe not world class, but damned close.  While I used to be content just grinding, my eyes have been opened to a whole other world, and I will be aiming to get back there, on my own roll, my own way.  I don't know if I'll end up running sky high, like Matt Moore, or if I'll fail miserably, but I'll keep you guys updated.

   If you've made it this far, thanks!  I appreciate you guys letting me vent and pour my worries and confusion out, and I hope it was at least an entertaining story for you.  I'll probably be dealing the Series this year, and just grinding it out at the low limit games on the Strip and online until then.

I took him up on his offer and busted out. He re-staked me (along with many others) every time, but eventually I got too embarrassed to ask and quit. (I would post the thread but can't find it, it's filled with good advice.)

So, back to my normal poker activity, which had meant reloading my pokerstars account with a fresh $50 every 5 months or so. The one thing this redditor taught that stuck with me was to play low stakes relative to my bankroll, something I now know is called ""bankroll management"". The next time I hit zero, instead of ponying up another $50 I started playing FPP tourneys. When I won I would swap the winnings for money and I would play micro-limits sit'n'gos, the $.10 and $.25 variety. I busted many times, but eventually (must have taken 6 months) I got to $50. But now, I wasn't so ready to gamble my money away. I kept playing low limits, and so my misfortunes never got me bust. Very very slowly I built my bankroll up to $450 playing mostly $1-$2 sit'n'gos, and occasionally I would indulge myself and splash out in a more expensive tourney. Last week, in one of those occasions, I won 1st place in a $5 hyper-turbo (I know, I know) boosting my bankroll to over $1400.

So, in a way, I completed the challenge. The redditor in question is /u/anonymous7 and he is a moderator in this sub.

I'm currently looking at different ways to monetize playing/coaching poker without packing up and moving out of the country post Black Friday (did that once, but its too difficult on the family).  

Figured this was a decent place to gauge viewership interest as it kind of hits what I think would be a good target market: relatively internet savvy people who are into poker but don't have a ton of traditional ""grinder"" experience in the mid level range and are looking for good/cheap/free ways to improve.  

So, would you have interest in watching free, streamed, ad-supported coaching sessions/lessons?  My general coaching method is to review tournament hand histories via a hand replayer while discussing hands/situations with my students on Skype (again, this is a review of an already completed tournament, not live ghosting a player and telling them what to do).  The uptick of twitch.tv makes me wonder if I could create enough channel viewership/buzz to make this worthwhile.

I would be focusing on the student while reviewing their history, but would certainly be fine with the standard streaming format of hopping on the channel and answering questions before/after commercial breaks or at the start/end of a lesson.  So tell me Reddit, is this something you'd watch/support?

I can post resumes etc, but I was a former exclusively online professional player (Used to 20+ table MTTs 5-6 days a week) who has transitioned to more live play recently. I've final tabled most online majors, won a Pokerstars SCOOP Championship, have been a top 100 rated player previously, and have over 350k of MTT online winnings.  I've also played a full live WSOP schedule of 20-25 tourneys for the last 3 years.  I also have lots of references from students who have gone on to be very successful and am well known and well reputed in the online poker community.

I earned $18 an hour working for a call center and I hated this job. I will earn in average $14 from live 1/2, and this is before I move to 2/5.

Bankroll is $30,000 atm BUT I got to pay rent and food, total is around $1,500 a month. Needless, I am going to start playing tomorrow.

If I wanna win $2,100 a month, I have to play around 150 hours - I plan to play 40 hours a week minimum (5x8), so I should be fine, and have enough bankroll to manage some variance.

Some advice appreciated, thank you. Questions:

1) I plan to move on to 2/5 when my bankroll reaches $50,000. Good idea?

2) How much should I buy in at 2/5? Still maximum?

3) Worth noting every session I play, whether I win or lose, etc in a small book?

4) Worth drawing the player and trying to recognize them over time (i.e. notes on regular).

5) Is a 8 hours poker session reasonable?

Thanks. I already left my job, there is no backing down. I can go back if my bankroll is dry but I hope not to get there.

I'm making an offer to people who have a Full Tilt account, but don't have any money in it. You've either never deposited and never won a freeroll, or you've lost whatever money you deposited or won.

I'll transfer you $1 and you can take another shot, but with a few **conditions**:

1. **Full Tilt only**. It's the only place I have an account.
2. I'm only offering this to current redditors, not new accounts.
3. Let me know your Full Tilt screen name, and I'll transfer you $1.
4. You pick a (ring) game out of the following: no limit hold'em full ring (9 handed); no limit hold'em 6-max; pot limit omaha 6-max; pot limit omaha high-low 6-max.
5. Play that game - and only that game - **following my rules for bankroll management** (see comment).
6. If you go bust, let me know and I'll transfer you another $1.
7. If you make it to $1,000, pay it forward somehow (like this, or sharing your knowledge, or something else).

**Let us know how you go!**

If you don't have a Full Tilt account, you can create one, **but make sure you get rakeback FIRST!**.

Why am I doing this? I'm not entirely sure, but at least a) to promote good bankroll management, b) because I've run about $2,000 above EV (my bankroll is about $7,000 and I started with $10 on Full Tilt), and c) because it would be so awesome if someone turned $1 into $1,000 - and I know it can be done!

----

**Edit:** If you're creating a new Full Tilt account, you need rakeback **first**. I'm with RakeTheRake, and they're great. (In two hours, I'm going to play in a *totally free* RakeTheRake $25,000 freeroll.) If you use this referrer link: [http://www.raketherake.com/?Refer=1051071](http://www.raketherake.com/?Refer=1051071), you'll get 27% of your rake back and I'll get 4%.

At the time, I had just completed my first full month playing poker for a living. I crushed it my first month (I admitted at the time that I'd been very lucky) and had to brag a bit to /poker. I've now been at it for six months, and I haven't had to apply for a ""real job"" yet, so I thought I'd offer you some thoughts on my poker startup six months in. I apologize in advance for the length.

**I (still) love poker** I know at six months I'm still young for a full-time player, but I can honestly say that so far I haven't experienced anything like the burnout I've been warned about. I am still eager to play; I haven't had many jobs in my life where I was eager to go to work. I still want to play often enough that I haven’t had to “make myself” play yet.

**Live poker is easy. Really easy.** Some of you are no doubt losing players at live cash games, and I don't want to come off as condescending, but the fact is that anyone of reasonable intellect and drive can become a significant winner playing low-stakes live games. Many players are predictably passive calling stations. Lots of the others are spewy super-aggro guys who don’t know how to check. If you adjust to these two types of players properly, you will win money. Even when I thought I was good enough to quit my previous job, I didn’t realize how exploitable the tables I was playing were. Stay away from marginal situations and just pound your big hands. Throw in a *very* small number of well-timed bluffs, and you’re off to the races.

**Bigger stakes are overrated** My biggest surprise is that I can make a living playing $1/2. Yep, you read that correctly. Many of you cautioned me about the stakes I played during my first month. Given that my poker bankroll and personal savings account differ in name only, and given that I have a stay-at-home wife and three children, I realized after a few tough sessions at bigger stakes that the swings were torture. It’s really tough leaving work for the day after losing a quarter of your bankroll. It was unacceptable, and it put my family in jeopardy. The players are generally better as you move up (duh!). Even though I still enjoy playing $2/5 PLO, and even though I aim to become a better player at higher stakes, I realize that it’s probably impossible to beat $2/5 NLHE at the same (proportionate) rate that I beat $1/2. It’s just a different game with different players, and the fact is that I just dominate $1/2. I am profitable in just over 80% of my $1/2 sessions (as opposed to around 60% at $2/5) and I make about $50/hour at both (this includes promotional money like high hands bonuses and proceeds from a weekly free-roll tournament they run if you play at least ten hours that week). I know from other forums that some people think that beating $1/2 live at that rate is impossible; I don’t really want to have that debate. All I can say is that if you’re a good player, come to the casinos of Oklahoma and try it. It’s what I make, and it’s not that difficult to do.

**Table selection is important** As a regular, you quickly learn who the whales are, who the super-aggro college kids are (I play near a university), and who the uber-nits are. You are losing money if you’re not keeping an eye on the players in the room and actively seeking transfers to more profitable tables. A couple of my biggest benefactors called me out on this recently, as I moved (once again) to their table from another. I just said, “I like to be where the action is! You guys make it fun!” They laughed, “Well, there does always seem to be a lot of money on the tables we’re at.” (I left out the part about them funding my kids’ college savings.)
 
**Casino selection and promotional selection are important** If you live near more than one casino, I strongly recommend keeping track of how you do at different venues. Since my main venue is near a university, there are a lot of college kids playing through their Pell Grants, whereas the casino thirty minutes in the other direction is mostly “good ol’ boys” (think Doyle Brunson look, but not skill). I’ve tailored my play schedule around when the juiciest games are and when the casinos offer the best promotions. The closest poker room offers a high hand bonus every hour after 2 am, whereas another casino offers a high hand bonus every thirty minutes between noon and midnight. In each case, I can add $7-$12 an hour to my winrate by playing when high hand is running (depending, obviously, on how many players are there. Very often there is only a single table running after 4 am, and I’m a night owl anyway). (As I side note, I also decrease the variance of high hand bonuses by agreeing to split them with other willing players at the table. I’ve also shown a decent profit from buying the high hands from people for less than they’re worth — I think I’ve gotten pretty good at estimating the likelihood of a hand holding up. Usually people will take much less than what the actuarial value would be. I’ve even bought hands like QQQTT with ten minutes left and only one table running for $60. People are really phobic about their hand getting beaten.) One other note about promotions like this: You don’t have to win any money directly from the promotion to benefit. If a fish wins the bonus, you indirectly win a slice. If a fish chooses to stay awhile longer because the promotion is running, you benefit. In the long run, it can affect your winnings noticeably.

**Time away from the table is crucial** I know I’m just repeating what people have said on other forums, but if you’re a serious player, you should spend time every week reading articles or books, watching training videos, and discussing interesting spots with poker friends. You should also be active and stay healthy. When I feel better, I play better.

**Friendship is precarious** I see the same players over and over again, and over time I’ve made friends with some of them. They’re nice guys, but most of them lose money playing. Becoming their friend has put me in awkward spots (see below). Sometimes people expect you to go easy on them if you become friends, but you can’t lose sight of the fact that, if they are at the table with you, your goal is to take their money. Every last dollar. 

**Never loan money to people you only know through poker** I know you guys are thinking, “Duh!”, but I had to learn this lesson the hard way. Your mileage may vary, but I made the mistake of making several loans and it did not end well.

**NEW ADDITION Treating players well** If you're playing the same player pool a lot, it's especially important not to be a dick (Life tip: It's always a good idea to avoid being a dick). Yes, you shouldn't tap the glass, but it goes beyond that. When I started playing full-time, I didn't realize how much I came off as cocky know-it-all. I sometimes evaluated other players at the table and, embarrassingly, sometimes even berated their play. I am still working on being affable at the table and being a good sport, but several players have commented that they have noticed a change. You're going to upset people when you take their money; don't make it worse by being a dick. Remember that most players are there to have a good time. Do whatever you can to make their experience enjoyable. (Thanks to fackingcanuck for reminding me to add this.)

That’s it for now. I welcome any questions about playing low stakes cash games for a modest living and look forward to your comments.

**EDIT** Upon rereading some of my comments, I see that I come down hard on live players in general. Obviously, there are plenty of good ones. But the bad ones far outnumber the good ones. Once you identify a good player, just be a little more cautious about entering pots against him. You'll have plenty of opportunities against the weaker players. Sure, you'll go back-and-forth a little, but you won't win any serious long-term money from other winning players.",,False,,t5_2qhix,True,,,True,t3_fpwmy,http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/fpwmy/what_ive_learned_in_6_months_of_professional_play/,

-------------------

.

Driving across the border is a nightmare, so the best thing to do is to take the “last USA exit” on I-5, and park in the parking lot there, and simply walk across the border to Mexico. We park, I throw my $16K and all of the contents of my wallet, except one credit card, a few hundred bucks, and my ID, into the trunk of Tim's car, I grab my backpack, and we walk to the border. On the other side of the turnstile gate, we pass four Mexican policeman with assault rifles, and my cell phone beeps at me, showing a text message from my phone company, welcoming me into Mexico and reminding me that I will be charged an arm and a leg if I wish to make any calls while in Mexico. A small chip in my phone, which is more powerful than my computer in college was, is using mathematics derived from the Theory of Relativity and the Lorenz equations to grab a signal from a satellite orbiting the planet and pinpoint my exact location to within a meter, so that Verizon can charge me more to call somebody. What a fascinating world.

Just the other side of the guards, there's a line of yellow taxis, and we get in and tell the guy to take us to the Hong Kong Club. He doesn't really understand English, and there's no meter running, but he does recognize and know where the Hong Kong Club is, and $10 USD seems to satisfy him for payment to get there. The two main strip clubs in Tijuana are the Hong Kong Club and Adelita's Bar. They lie in about a 2 square block area that is a “safe zone” for tourists, and cops are all around to make sure that nobody ruins city's trade business. There's also food vendors with carts everywhere, so cheap authentic Mexican food is available any time.

We walk into the Hong Kong Club. There are restaurant-style benches with tables filled with guys and bikini-laden girls. We head to the back and to the right, through a double-door that leads into a room with a big stage and a single girl dancing around a pole. In America, there's a big stigma about prostitution, and we have a cultural assumption that it's for broken girls and human trafficking and just all kinds of badness. But in Tijuana, it's just their job, they're happy to be making the kind of money that drunk Americans give them, and they are grateful for the business. They are happy to make men happy. It's a fair trade, an honest business, and they welcome the customers. It's just not sleazey and degrading like I had originally assumed it would be on my first trip to Tijuana. And best of all, the girls here are gorgeous. They are all young, thin, and frankly amazing. Using the normal ranking scale, I'd describe most as a 7 or 8, but there are a lot of 9's and 10's as well. They all approach each of us, rubbing our backs and legs with their hands as we walk by, letting us know they are available for hire. We walk by them and head up the stairs to a balcony area overlooking the main stage, and a guy comes over to ask us if we'd like anything. We each order a beer and chat for a little bit, reminiscing and catching up, before we signal him over again and ask him to find us some company.

He brings over what must have been the three most beautiful girls in the place. It is “suggested” that we order the girls a beer—they get an affiliate's cut from the bar whenever we order them drinks—and we are happy to do so. One girl comes and sits on my lap, puts one arm around my shoulder, hanging off me, and uses her free hand to caress my leg and occasionally gently squeeze on my crotch. It's very pleasant.

I use my amazing high school Spanish skills and ask my girl for a “bailar” and she does an amazing lap dance. After a few minutes and another beer, we call the waiter guy over and ask him how much the girls charge to go “upstairs”—i.e. to the by-the-half-hour motel that sits adjacent to the club. I write “$75 ?” on a napkin, and he talks in Spanish to the girl, and she seems to agree. She takes my hand and leads me out the front door of the club, one yard to the left, and into a doorway with a staircase that leads up to the reception desk of the hotel. I give the guy $30 for the half hour—although they offer a full day for $45—and he gives me a key, and we find our way to the room.

It's a quaint little room, and there's a small-ish HD tv on the wall playing a porno. She has her own condom, and wouldn't trust me even if I'd brought mine—safety first and all that. She puts it on me and we proceed to have a very nice time, with a few minutes left at the end for a very quick shower, so I can get back in my clothes reasonably clean. I give her $100 and imply as best I can that she keep the extra, and she seems exceedingly grateful about this. She grabs three $1 bills from her purse and gives them to me and points at the guys standing in the hallway waiting for us to finish so they can clean them room, and she says “this, but not more”. I guess the room-cleaners of Tijuana are making too much these days. She then smiles at me and gives me a kiss on the cheek before leaving and I finish dressing, and leave a minute or two later, handing the few bucks to the guy in the hallway, and returning the key to the front desk.

I meet Tim downstairs and we grab some food at a sidewalk vendor and chat for a while, when J.J. comes running down the stairs laughing hysterically and tells us we need to leave. We gulf down our food and start walking, eventually getting to Revolución Street, a main drag in Tijuana, not at the clubs but still reasonably safe. As we walk towards Hotel Tijúan, J.J. still cracking up uncontrollably tells us that he managed to get his girl to give him head while sitting on the toilet seat, and basically tricked her into fulfilling his fantasy of a perfectly-timed climax blumpkin. The girl he was with was surprised and NOT happy about this. We might be permanently barred from the Hong Kong Club, I'm not sure. We do decide though that this is a hopping town with lots of music and partying in the street, so even though we got laid, we're gonna stay the night and hang out, partying and potentially getting more girls. Hotel Tijúan is a much more upscale place, not the Bellagio, but more like the Bellagio of Tijuana. Tim gets a room, and he and J.J. and I all go in and check it out. There are two beds, and it's really nice. I decide that if we're staying the night in Tijuana, this is definitely the type of place I need to be able to come to for sanctuary—as opposed to Jizz Motel above the Hong Kong Club—and I immediately go downstairs and fork up $100 for my own suite for the night. My suite is even bigger than theirs and has one king sized bed and big bathroom and a jacuzzi. Nice.

On the way out the door, I get a sharp pain in the side of my back. I guess I pulled something, I'm not sure. I do do a lot of just sitting all day when I play poker, and once again, I haven't slept in two days, having spent the previous night in the Ocean's 10-20. Tim and J.J. go off looking for music and fun, and I go looking for a genuine massage parlor that gives actual massages. It takes a lot of mis-communication and confusion to tell the ladies running the parlors that I want an actual massage as opposed to a happy ending “massage”, and in the end, I never do find a place for a real massage. I'm also fairly tired and worn out, so combined with that, the pain in my back, the food settling, and having sexual release a few hours prior, I decide to just go back to my suite and hit the jacuzzi and potentially nap for a bit.

As I get to my room, the food settling takes a turn for the worse and I spend 15 minutes in other kinds of agony in the bathroom. Usually the Mexican food has been good to me, but not today apparently. I settle on my bed and turn on the TV in the room, and find an English sitcom on one of the channels, and just veg out, relaxing my body and mind, and trying to just generally recover and rejuvenate from the stress of the past few days. I drift off a little bit but then get a spurt of energy as my back spasms a little bit. I decide to start running the water for the hot tub, so I can run the jets on my back. It goes very slow and it looks like it might take an hour or more, so I pull out my laptop from my backpack, enter the password for its full disk encryption, and boot up. The hotel, being the Bellagio of Tijuana, has free wifi, so after I turn on my firewalls and start up my VPN, I securely start surfing the web. I know it's pretty geeky to be in Tijuana and surfing the web on my computer, but I was very worn out, and it was my way of relaxing.

Before the hot tub had filled up, there's banging at my door, and I open it up to find a very inebriated Tim telling me he needs my room. Apparently, Hotel Tijúan fills to capacity weekend nights, and Tim and J.J. had found a few gorgeous girls on the street who would be their companions for the whole night for a few hundred bucks and he wanted my nice place with the hot tub for a few hours instead of the sleazier hotels by the clubs. He could tell I really didn't want to oblige but he insisted, and I didn't want to ruin his trip, and I guess I also felt like he had a point, because I really wasn't utilizing the room to it's full potential.

I put away my computer and grabbed my backpack and head towards the only other place in Tijuana I know of, the strip clubs. At this point however, I'm very tired and in pain, and stressed and I just want to sleep. I go up stairs to the by-the-hour hotel and just pay the $45 for a night, just so I have a goddamned bed to sleep in. I try not to imagine the plethora of sex and fluids that the bed has seen as I doze off.

Not more than a few hours later, I wake up with a massive headache, and very groggy, still having not gotten more than a few hours of sleep over the past few days. My head hurts, my back hurts, I'm tired, and I can't sleep. I also see through side of the blinds a girl leading a guy into a room across the hallways, and I remember where I am.

.

Since my time after college, living in Seattle, and grinding micro stakes in Vegas, I've gone from a liberal democrat to a civil libertarian-bordering-on-anarchist. Not being able to find a job, watching the housing crisis happen, seeing how inefficient politics is, watching the wars drone on and on, seeing criminal bankers not be jailed and politicians be bought—basically I've been growing more and more cynical about the world as each day goes by. My mom kicked me out—or at least I felt like she had—and the whole world was fucking broken and getting worse. Everything I had been told and believed in, all the people and family I trusted, I felt like they had all bailed on me.

I had known Tim for years—he was and still is one of my closest friends. He and his wife have an open relationship, and they are one of the most honest loving couples I know, and some of the best and most trustworthy people I know as well.

I mention these things because it all came crashing down on me at two in the morning in Jizz Motel in Tijuana when I woke up, with a headache and back ache, and groggy. I felt like Tim had betrayed me. I felt like not only could I not trust the world, but I couldn't trust my friends and teammates, and now I couldn't even trust my closest friend, who by the way was sleeping around when he had a beautiful wife. Everything I knew about how the world worked was in shambles. I was alone in the world. Everything and every one I cared about or trusted had let me down and abandoned me. I was in great physical pain, very tired, and now psychologically, the whole world came crashing down as I lie in the bed of this hooker motel.

I snapped. What was I doing here? What was I doing with my life? What the fuck was going on!? How did this happen? This isn't me. I was really freaking out. All I wanted in the world was to be back home in Las Vegas in bed. I started crying. After a few minutes, I left, taking my room key with me—I had paid in cash, so it's not like they could charge me for it. I hopped in a cab and told him to take me to Hotel Tijúan, and I scribbled a letter to Tim saying I was leaving and going back to Vegas, and I told them it was very important that the guy in my room get this letter. Even though I was very upset, I still didn't want them freaking out wondering where I was. I then took the cab to the border, and waited at the line back into the States with a bunch of kids from UCSD. I gave my ID to the border agent, and he told me I should really bring my passport next time, but he let me through after scanning my license. Once I was in the states, I found a cab who would take my credit card, and took the half hour ride to the San Diego airport.

Once there, I hopped on the airport's wifi and found a Southwest flight leaving in an hour and a half to Vegas for $160. I was kind of jazzed up from the freakout, so I couldn't nap, so I went back on the wifi and used [my VPN setup](http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/15eihx/7trxmk6zs_guide_to_getting_on_stars_in_the_usa/) to play on Stars for an hour before the flight started boarding. Before getting on the plane, I thought to call Tim's cell and leave him a message, just in case the hotel didn't get to him. He had a GSM phone and a SIM card for Mexico, and his Google Voice forwarded to all his numbers, so I knew he'd get the message. I boarded the plane and back in Vegas, took a cab back to my apartment. I knew my stuff was safe in Tim's car, and I knew I'd get it back when he came back home.

But I still couldn't manage to sleep. For hours, I sat in my apartment, confused, angry, tired, thinking about the world and about my life. I would have killed myself at that point if I'd had a weapon. I didn't, and the effort of leaving my home and going out to get one was more trouble than it was worth, being as tired and in as much pain as I was.

Finally, at about noon on Sunday, I was able to fall asleep in my own bed.

I've been playing poker for a while now and just recently started taking lessons. I was wondering if I streamed an MTT coaching session (2 hours), how many people would be interested in viewing it?

My poker coach is Brandon Shane (theshanetrain22) and his coaching profile can be found at http://www.pocketfives.com/coaches/shanetrain22 and his tourney performance can be found at http://www.pocketfives.com/profiles/shanetrain22

His lessons are $50/hour, which is crazy cheap, and hes really good. He gets amazing reviews and after my first session with him I see why.

I'm thinking about Wednesday afternoon, some time between 6 and 10 pm (United States - EST). Trying to get a lot of people to view this stream (twitch.tv/TampaBayManning), so spread the word!

Edit: I have consent from my Coach to do this, so no worries there. Even if you aren't interested, please upvote so people who might be interested can see this.

Originally it was just going to be a comment in that thread, but it ended up longer than I expected, so I'll post it on its own.


**6 Reasons Professional Poker Is Way Easier Than It Looks**

** *1. (Almost) Everyone thinks they're good at poker* **

But they're not. Very few people are actually skilled at poker, yet the vast majority of players who get into a game think they are good, or they at least think they will be good with a little experience. People generally overestimate their own ability to read other people, bluff well, and be generally cunning. This is good for you, the guy who actually *is* good at poker. In the long run, the fish have no chance.

** *2. People like to gamble* **

Even players who understand some of the basics of poker strategy and math often like to gamble. They are sometimes willing to get money in knowing they are a statistical underdog, but they are just hoping to get lucky. They are gambling, and the overdog plays of the role of the ""house"" on this gamble. If you are always on the favored side in these gambles, you *will* win money. It doesn't take a tremendous amount of discipline to refuse to get money in when you know (or reasonably expect) that you are not getting the proper odds to be in the pot. This discipline is not fun, it's not sexy, and it won't impress the hot cocktail waitress. But it will make you gobs of money, and you'll attract a girl way better than that slutty cocktail waitress anyway when your fat stacks are falling out of your pocket on your way out of the casino.

** *3. People are emotional* **

Everyone is prone to tilt. Even you, but you're smart enough to take a break when you feel it coming on, and that's better than what most players do. They play right through their emotional highs and lows, and they often make very expensive mistakes when they are tilting. As an observant player, you notice when players are on tilt, and which players are most prone to tilt badly. When the signs of tilt show, you know it's worth getting into pots you otherwise would not, because the potential payoff has just risen. You know you must strike when the iron is hot, and the smoke coming out of seat 3's ears suggests the time is now. And you'll make money off of other emotions, too. The player who has had a great night will open up late in the session and splash around too much; he's just having too much fun and in too good a mood to fold. And that player who's just moved up in stakes is emotional, too -- she's *fearful*, having never played for this much money. And she's also scared of that river card, since it brought in the flush. Sure, you were on the straight draw, but she's never calling a big bet here. Professional players take advantage of these emotions, and it can be very profitable.

** *4. Most players are way too lazy or stupid to read books and articles, or even be open to other opinions when discussing poker* **

There's a reason that chess is not more mainstream in the US. It's *hard* to be good. *Really, really hard.* Poker is difficult to master, too, but, somewhat ironically, some of its most avid fans don't realize how hard it is. They don't realize just how deep the rabbit hole goes, how many aspects of the game they could be thinking through. They certainly don't realize how many leaks they have, and how many opportunities they are missing. One of the reasons is that most players don't work on their game. They don't think through tough spots postmortem; they don't read books or watch training videos; they don't talk about hands with good players (well, they do talk about hands, but their discussions consist entirely of bad beat stories). And these are the guys who pay the professional player's bills. The pro *does* read online forums, books, articles; she *does* discuss tough situations with other good players. And in so doing, she separates herself from almost all of her opponents (and separates them from their paychecks). 

** *5. As poker has grown, a lot of people who never would have tried poker in the 'old days' have flocked to poker rooms, both live and online* **

First, let me be clear: I was not around in the old days. But I've heard about them, and I've certainly seen them in movies. These are the days when poker games were contested mostly be bookies, gangsters, and cowboys. They were the days when poker was ""dirty"". It was underground, and you almost certainly had a cigar collection if you played. Now poker players get a spot on Letterman, right after Drew Brees and before Katy Perry. Grannies take a break from their slot machines to play; college frat boys take a break from studying to play. By opening up to the masses, poker has brought in a tremendous number of fish, and they collectively carry a tremendous amount of dead money. Sure, it's also brought in some great players, but the ratio of fish:sharks is very, very high. These days, a pro can make a living playing mostly recreational players. Sure, pros have to go head-to-head sometimes, and the most accomplished pros enjoy the challenge of facing one another, but a low-level local pro can make good money facing mostly recreational players that would not have been in the game twenty years ago.

** *6. The lifestyle is as good as it gets* **

There are not a lot of jobs that are completely free from deadlines, clients/customers, bosses, a dress code, or required working hours. As far as I can tell, playing poker offers more freedom than any other job. Not only are poker pros free from bosses, clients, and a set schedule, they can work anywhere a game is running. When I took my wife on a cruise a few months ago, I wasn't really planning on working during the trip. But there was a poker table on the ship, and she had several spa treatments planned, as well as a few shows that I had no interest in. So I decided to play (i.e., work) while she enjoyed those activities. As it turned out, I paid for almost our entire cruise playing about 15 hours of poker during the week we were aboard. The point: I can work almost anywhere I want (and once internet poker is brought back, we will be able to drop the ""almost""). I can work whenever I want, and I answer to no one. Even though there are stressful aspects of the job, the freedom more than makes up for the bad beats and losing sessions.

More importantly though, I genuinely feel that these kinds of posts are detrimental to new players looking to improve. A new player who sees the third and second nuts being beat all the time would lead to them nitting up and playing scared, which is never a good idea in this game.

(For searches: where to play online in America American US united states merge cake minted everleaf bodog accept players).,REInvestor,59,7,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/jr1nj/live_in_the_us_and_want_to_play_online_here_are/,"This question is asked almost daily, so I figured I would write a post that would answer the question well and also appear in the search (hence all of the tags). What follows are the best options available to US players after Black Friday. I am not going to make a firm recommendation one way or the other, as I don't play on all these networks, but I've done my best to provide the essential information after doing a good bit of research. If I got something wrong, please correct me.

###General Advice

* I would not deposit more money than you can afford to lose in the event these sites get shut down and they pull a Full Tilt. Until all aspects of online poker are legalized in the US, I would treat your deposit as essentially play money. Lots of us still play on these sites fully knowing the inherent risks, but it would be unwise to keep your whole roll on them.

* Each ""Network"" has a bunch of different ""skins"" which are interfaces, but they are also an independently owned franchise with their own support and bonuses. Do your research on each one to find the best deal. To the best of my knowledge, the skins I have linked to are the biggest and most repped ones for each network. Also, each skin can offer different promotions/rakeback deals, so research to make sure you maximize your bonsuses and rakeback before signing up for any site.

* But which one has the most fish? There are crappy players everywhere you go. I don't believe that anybody can make a blanket statement that one of these sites has more fish than any other. At the micros, everyone is pretty bad.

* All of these sites appear to have really strong customer service except maybe Cake.

* Here is a continuing [2+2 thread](http://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/28/internet-poker/where-can-us-players-play-1021260/) on where US players can play online. Go to around post 90 for more recent conversation.

* Here is the [2+2 subforum](http://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/28/internet-poker/) for discussion of internet poker sites. If you have a specific question, I would search there first.

* View [traffic stats](http://www.pokerscout.com/) of the sites.

###Options

* **[Bodog.](http://www.bodog.eu/)** Probably the fastest cash outs of all the sites. Customer service is quite good. They use a point system which is pretty bad compared to a straight rakeback deal. Some folks don't like the interface and your hand histories are not automatically saved, so you'll have to buy Idleminer if you're using Holdem Manager. Further, you're limited to only 4 tables open at a time which is ridiculous. They've been around for a long time, and IMO, are the most trustworthy of the current crop of sites. [Reddit thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/iyqmu/worth_it_to_play_on_bodog_us_player/) on Bodog.

* **[Everleaf Network](http://www.everleafgaming.com/)** ([Minted](http://www.mintedpoker.com/index.php), [Raiseandfold](http://www.raiseandfold.com/)), etc.) Most folks are reporting cashouts within roughly two weeks. Rakeback is 40% with up to an extra 10% in rake races and other bonuses. The interface isn't the best, but they're supposed to be coming out with new software within a few months. Traffic is low, but getting better.

* **[Yatahay Network](http://www.yatahay.com/).** ([True Poker](http://www.truepoker.eu/), [Doyle's Room](http://www.doylesroom.net/)). I've never played on this network, but players are reporting check cashouts within two weeks. Rakeback is 27%, but traffic is low

* **[Cake Poker.](http://cakepoker.eu/en/Default.aspx)** ([Intertops](http://poker.intertops.eu/en/)). This site has had some controversy in the past [\(2+2 thread\)](http://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/28/internet-poker/won-50000-60000-off-guy-cake-poker-cakepoker-takes-my-funds-update-settled-1040155/). They apparently settled the issue recently, but the whole thing scared away a lot of players, myself included. Having said that, a lot of like it, but as of late, cashouts have been taking two months or more for some people. Rakeback is 33% paid weekly plus a points system. Here is a recent [thread on Cake](http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/jpy84/im_considering_depositing_on_cake_poker_and_would/). I think there are better options available. Having said that, a lot of players are strongly supporting [Intertops](http://poker.intertops.eu/en/) which is now on the Cake Network, as they have a separate cashier which is offering cashouts within 1-2 weeks.

* **[Merge Network](http://www.mergegaming.com/).** ([RPM Poker](http://www.rpmpoker.com/), [Lock Poker](http://lockpoker.eu/), [Carbon](http://www.carbonpoker.ag/)). They are currently **NOT** accepting US players but will most likely start up again in September according to their CS. They use a [point system](http://www.rpmpoker.com/vip/) instead of rakeback which is pretty terrible for microstakes players. Until you're grinding like crazy, you might be getting only the equivalent of 15% once you've built up enough points. Traffic at night is regularly over 10,000 players. Once they come back, I would recommend depositing for the traffic alone.

* **Bitcoin sites.** ([BTC On Tilt](http://btcontilt.com)) I have no experience with this site, and cannot comment. Here is a [/r/poker search for bitcoin](http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/search?q=bitcoin&amp;restrict_sr=on) if you're interested in researching it.

**Poker Game Types:**

* Cash/Ring Games: 
&gt; You play with direct stakes, meaning that the value written on each chip corresponds to the chip's value in real- or play money. Every hand is a game in itself and you can sit down and leave the table whenever you like. Variations include Pot Limit (PL), Limit , and the more commonly No Limit (NL)

* Multi Table Tournys (MTTs): 
&gt; You follow a fixed tournament structure, with increasing blinds and antes. Play continues till you are the last player remaining or you no longer have any chips. Variations include PL and more commonly NL. 

* Sit n Gos (SnGs):
&gt; Same concept as MTTs but usually with smaller fields. Commonly defined as a MTT with 18 - 90 Players. 

* Single Table Tournys (STTs):
&gt;  Same concept as MTTs but restricted to a single table, anywhere between 6 - 10 Players. 

* Heads Up (HU):
&gt; This can either be cash or a tourny structure but consists of only 2 players per game. 


* Poker Variations:
&gt; Variations include: Texas Hold'em, Omaha, Stud, Razz and others.

1375736819.0,49,self.poker,1jrl2x,How to beat bad players,CardCounter0,80,31,92,http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/1jrl2x/how_to_beat_bad_players/,"* Lots of Bad players always calling, every hand going at least 5 handed, cracking your good hand?

Okay, I was going to reply to this but it will probably get lost in the noise of the thread it came from, and this is a topic that I have seen come up frequently.  So it deserves it's own thread.

Here is a very well expressed train of thought that comes up frequently:

&gt; I realize how its profitable if you can flop a straight or a flush or a set but top pair top kicker and big pocket pairs were not cutting it. Even if I sit around and wait on AA, KK, QQ, AK, AQ, which is basically what i did. Im still an underdog because 5 or 6 players are going to be there on the flop. If youre hitting straights and flushes youre going to make thousands. If youre trying to win with TPTK youre going to lose in this game.

Okay, let's analyze the first statement, because it is totally correct:

Flopping straights and flushes and sets is very profitable.  Good.  Against a full table of calling stations, TPTK rarely turns out to be the best hand by the river.  Also correct.  No problems so far.

How about the second sentence?

*Sit around and wait on AA, KK, QQ, AK, AQ* -- Wait.  Stop.  AA KK QQ are never suited.  They can't flop any flushes.  You already realize that floping straights and flushes is the way to profits.  So why are you waiting for AA KK QQ?  They can't flop a straight or a flush.  They are top pair kinds of hands which you just said aren't cutting it!  Now AA KK QQ can flop sets - but so can JJ TT 99 88 77 66 55 44 33 and 22, so why are you just waiting on AA KK QQ?

Your other two hands you are waiting for?  AK and AQ?  Well, the only straight they are going to flop is broadway.  T9 has much greater chances of making a straight than AK.  In the flush department, A2s is just as good as AKs when it comes to flushes.  ATs is just as good as AKs when it comes to straights or flushes.  So why you just waiting on AK?  You are waiting on AK to make TPTK and lose to 96o making two pair on the river for the 50th time?  

And now the third and fourth sentences:

&gt; If youre hitting straights and flushes youre going to make thousands. If youre trying to win with TPTK youre going to lose in this game.

Yes, that is just repeating what you said in the first sentence.  Both are correct.

So the whole key to beating a bunch of bad players who are playing every hand and seeing every flop no matter what?  I think the key is contained in the second sentence.  

&gt; Even if I sit around and wait on AA, KK, QQ, AK, AQ, which is basically what i did.

Can you figure it out?

I experienced this twice over the past week.  You are playing late at night and the games have consolidated into 2 tables (or there is 1 main game and a 1 ""must move"" table running).  The game you are at is getting short while the other table is full (rooms won't try to balance tables because in the confusion of musical chairs they usually wind up breaking both games).

Your table gets to 6 handed, and Mr. Nitty McNitt (usually when it is his turn to post the big blind) declares ""I'm not playing 6 handed"" and quits. Somebody else chimes in with ""Well, I'm not playing 5 handed"" and goes home, so of course the game breaks.  At the very same time, 1 or 2 seats open up at the other game, so the floor comes over and usually you draw cards or something to see who gets the open seats and what order the remaining players go on the list to wait.

Okay, everything completely standard so far.  Here is where my pet peeve kicks in - Mr. Nitty McNitt, who initially didn't want to play short, and was the cause of the game breaking?  He wins the draw and gets the seat.  So you have 4 people who were perfectly willing to continue to play 6-handed sitting around waiting, while the guy responsible for breaking the game, is happily playing at the full table.  WTF!

When the first guy quits and breaks the short game -- he should automatically go to the bottom of the list.  Then the remaining 5 players should draw for the seats and positions on the list.  Yeah dude, you didn't want to play?  Okay, let's have the guys who do want to play get the seat and you can automatically wait the longest.  Justice!

This would also have the benefit of nobody wanting to be the first guy to quit and going to the bottom of the list, so the short game will run longer, until somebody legitimately quits to go home or something.

Made my first straight flush, almost got killed (literally killed, long read, need advice)",toolucky,54,9,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/gdfni/help_made_my_first_straight_flush_almost_got/,"Ok yesterday I had my first straight flush ever. Like, I never had a straight flush ever before.

First, let me say that in Quebec, poker is kinda limited. Loto-scammer controls all the market and competition is prohibited (all government-controlled). Thus, the only solution if you want to play poker, aside from underground/illegal casinos, is playing either at **the official casino** OR **at an indian reserve**. Yesterday, I chose the later, players on Sunday SUCK.

I was at a VERY aggressive/loose table and had to fold AK with a K 7 3 flop (6 people in the hand, lots of action, someone had a set. Fun thing, a guy with KT called to the bitter end). You get the idea of how aggressive and loose people were, calling with all kinds of hands. However, people are so loose that I tripled in one hand (88 on a AK8o flop - someone had Ax, someone had two pairs).

Finally I am sitting on the BB with [7](/hearts) [5](/hearts). Blinds are 1/2. Normally a easy fold hand, right? I entered the table with $200 and am now sitting at a comfortable $450. UTG raises to $11 and two people call. Looking at the odds (I called with T3 earlier and got a J33 flop and emptied a guy), I decided to call.

UTG has around $500 and is a HUUUUUGEEEE fish. ATM machine. How he made it so high, I have no idea. He calls with any possible draw - he called with A8 on a 569K flopturn, getting his 7 on the river.

MP+1 is very tight, the only tight player at the table, has around $75 left

SB is very loose and fishy, has around $135 and rebought several times

Flops comes [4](/hearts)[Q](/hearts)[6](/hearts). I first notice I flopped a flush, but don't immediately notice the open-handed straight flush draw! SB checks, I check too, UTG bets $15 in a $44 pot, MP+1 fold, SB fold, I call.

Turn comes [4](/hearts)[Q](/hearts)[6](/hearts)[K](/spades). Crap, no luck, and I'm stuck with a 7-high flush. But against such a lose player, I feel comfortable calling low bets.

I check, he bets $35 in a $74 pot and I have to give him credit for that. I think for a while and call. 

River is a BOMB.

[4](/hearts)[Q](/hearts)[6](/hearts)[K](/spades)[8](/hearts).

And here is the kicker... 

I do a simili-blocking bet of $45 in a $144 pot. Immediately he raises me to $115. I think for a while and decide to raise to $255. He thinks for a while and immediately goes all-in and I insta-call.

He laughs and says: ""Sorry, got the Ace. You got the King or queen? Prolly King?"" showing [A](/hearts)[2](/hearts) (also yes, he really did raise UTG with A2s). I flip over [5](/hearts)[7](/hearts) and his face changes from ""UHHH YOU CALLED ME WITH 7-HIGH FLUSH?"" to ""Oh my fucking god"". And I win this HUGE pot.

And now he's really pissed. Like, really really pissed. He stands up and screams bullshit. I don't know what to say and I feel a bit nervous. Then, he says ""You're a fucking idiot! You're a fucking idiot!"" All he can say is that. I just don't say anything and look at the table. The dealer makes it hard as well pushing that HUGEEE chip stack towards me. He keeps spitting insults at me and MP+1 just says ""That's poker, man"".

""HE CALLED MY RAISE PREFLOP WITH 57s! WHAT A FISH! 57!!!! He called with that!!! SEVEN HIGH!""

I just don't say a word. He then says: ""I'm going to get my money back one way or another is that fucking clear?"" and leaves the table.

I keep playing for a while, trying to cross the $1,000 line but just never making it, $945. It has been an hour since he left and he's sitting at the bar. Alcohol is free in Indian casinos. He's looking RIGHT at me. ALL this time. 

But what do I fear? He doesn't know who I am and he doesn't know which car is mine, even if he wanted to do anything to id. I sit at the table again and again and he waits for me, hour after hour. Finally, my play starts to suck; I drop to $810, I get one big hand, get back over $900 and feel ready to leave.  

I go to cash out and he's just looking at me. I have no idea what to do. As I'm standing to the cashier he's like ONE FOOT behind me. As the cashier counts the money, he yells: ""GOT A LUCKY NIGHT THERE RIGHT?"" so loud everyone in the casino hears him. I got see one security agent and explain the situation and how I'm not comfortable. He tells me to piss off (well, he ignores me for the most part). I have this strong feeling this big, drunk guy is going to attack me as soon as I leave the premises. 

I don't know what to do. I stand at the bar, thinking to myself that I am just a pussy. I'm 6', 230lbs, I train four times a week and I don't know what to do. I just wait at the bar and drink a bit, checking my stuff closely.

I go to the bathroom and he follows me, takes the stall right next to me and starts singing. I go back at the bar, he follows me and finally I have enough. I say politely:

ME: You got a problem man?

HIM: Nooooo I don't, do you?

ME: Stop following me. I'm not kidding.

HIM: I'm not following you man. 

ME: You are and that is making me uncomfortable. Please stop.

HIM: Let's play heads-up. You and I. $1,000 buyin.

I am *this* close to accept but I'm too tired, it's 2 AM, and whatever will happen, I'll lose (if I lose, I lose, if I win, he's more angry). I start to think of the possibilities. I could make a run for it to my car and I could possibly get away, but couldn't he note my license number? I could call the police, I don't know what they would do in the indian reserve. I decide to go see another agent. He says he will hold the guy and that I have five minutes to leave. I thank him and go outside.

I'm about halfway to my car and the guy is running outside.

I should say, the parking is really, really dark. At this hour you can't see anything. The Indian reserve barely has any lights. 

And he's coming at me, and he's not happy. He is running. I can a) Run into the nearby woods and whatever happens, happens b) Scream c) Stand back and fight. I don't really have time to make my mind as he's already next to me, so I yell:

""YOU GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME OR I WILL FUCKING KILL YOU.""

He stops moving and says: ""Got a lucky night, huh? Got a lucky night?""

I'm angry because it is so late and because of this stupid bullshit. I don't start a fight when I lose a hand.

""It was fucking poker. It was a fucking straight flush. IT HAPPENS, GET OVER IT fucking crybaby.""

I don't even realize how tensed I am. I am taller and probably stronger than him since he is so drunk. He put one hand in his pocket and now I have enough, I stand back behind a car. My plan is to put distance between him and me and pick some rocks on the ground and throw them as hard as I can to him. I'm really thinking that fast. If he has a knife and I think he has a knife, that should be fine. A few rocks should calm him down. At the same moment two security agents run outside and yell at him, he yells back at them. They take him back inside. One of them talks to me, he's obviously some kind of boss, and I explain what happened. He apologize and say he will call the police, and I'm allowed to leave, finally.

I run into my car, start it, my heart is pounding, my hands are shaking and I speed away from there, probably never to come back. As I am speeding on the highway, I'm scared that he is following me so I am really speeding hard. 

Finally I get home, stop the car and start to relax. It's well past 3AM and I work in the morning. I get inside, take a shower and go to sleep.

**Questions:**

What could I have done? How do you deal with that kind of situation? How do you avoid them? 

Was I all a pussy? Should I have ""played this"" more aggressively? I believe I did everything I could but for the timebeing, I'll have to stop going to Indian casinos and certainly will have to stop live poker for some time. 

Thanks for any help.

**TLDR**: Straight flush beat his Ace-high flush, guy got really pissed and couldn't believe it, tried to mug/kill me outside the casino. What do I do?

There is a sort of informal pressure to keep up with the pace of the game you are playing in.  Ignore this.

The simplest thing you can do to improve your game is to slow everything down.  Take your time on *every* decision.  This will annoy some of the other players, but let them be annoyed, you're likely to gain value from them being annoyed.

Ideas? This can happen as early as monday if there is enough interest.

I used to be a player on full tilt. I have been lurking this form and 2+2 and I have decided I would like to try playing at the local poker room. Here's my problem, I can't move my arms at all. One time (my first and only time playing live) when I was at the MGM in Vegas I went to the poker room and explained my situation and was accommodated **very well**. I sat to the right of the dealer and he showed me what I have and I verbally communicated what I wanted to do. Everything was going fine, and I was actually up about $150 when a player across from me just decided to be a total dick and started making a fuss about the dealer showing my cards and making my chip movements for me. I don't know if it was the fact that I outplayed him for about $100 two hands before (I broke his two pair with trips on the flop) or if he was just having a bad day, but ever since then I have been very hesitant to try playing live again. What I'm wondering is, do you guys think this was a one-time thing or would you as a player not want me at your table? what can I do to make it more comfortable for everybody? I don't want people to feel like I have an unfair advantage,  I'm just lookking to have the same fun you guys are. I appreciate any advice.

I am actually so sickened by this, Me and my friends play a regular game of hold'em pretty much every day/every other day, Nothing too serious, €5 buy in winner take all, Sometimes bigger if we feel like it, Everyone who plays knows each other very personally, We were friends long before we began playing poker together. We've been playing this regular game for about 8 months now. It's been super fun - Until 2 nights ago. 

I noticed in one of the games where just 3 of us were playing that one of the people who plays most regularly (Lets call him ""That dirty fucking cheating shitstain, Or just a Cheater, for short) Was dealing pretty goddamn weird. He'd deal almost backwards, with the deck face up, I didn't think much of it, Because fuck, Why would anyone cheat against friends? So the cheater deals, long story short he beats me with 2 pair A10 where I had A7, Didn't think much of it, But then I remembered that A10 was on the flop of the last hand. Again, As odd as this seemed I put it down to complete randomness and carried on. 

But then I finally saw it, The fucker was dealing from the bottom of the deck. He'd pick out cards he wanted from the previous flop, Put them on the bottom and deal them to himself. I was so fucking shocked I didn't even say anything, I just kept playing and kept watching him do it. I mean, What in the fuck? Why was this guy cheating in the friendliest game of cards you could ever find - Between friends no less? 

So we finish the game, The cheating shitstain leaves (After winning) and I tell the person I was playing with that I'm 99% sure he was dealing from the bottom of the deck. He agreed that he shuffled funny, But didn't see him bottom deal, So we said we'd just watch him carefully next game.2 days later the next game comes, This time there's 6 of us, The cheater deals twice and no bottom dealing (Everyone at the table bar the cheater knows at this stage that I have seen him cheat), The 3rd time though, He does it, My friend who was playing the previous game and who I told first about what I saw immediately called him on it. 

The cheater sits there like a deer in headlights, Not knowing what to say, Knowing he just got caught by the balls. He started flat out denying it, But he knows, we know, and now reddit knows he was bottom dealing. So he just flat out denies it, We can't really do much other than tell him *we all just fucking saw him do it*, so we play out the rest of the hand (the most awkward hand of poker i've ever played by the way), Pretty much everyone folds, We ask him to show his hand, It's AQs, He would of hit 2 pair on the flop. After the hand we just ask him to admit it so we can keep playing and assume he'll never do it again, He refuses to (While clearly knowing he was caught, fucker was shaking and everything) 

So he leaves the table and we haven't heard from him since. It was just fucking sickening, I nearly wouldn't mind if it was some scumbag at a casino table cheating, But for someone to come into a friendly game that's not even about money to steal money from friends? That shits all sorts of fucked up. 

So, Any similar stories?

I topped off in 2008 winning close to half a million dollars and did very well in recent years never winning less than 6 figures.  I've grinded mostly cash games and dabbled in tournaments online and live.  

I've won as much as $250k in a single day and have lost 5 figures many times.  I play everything, mostly online cash games (which I'm known for) but also online and live tournaments and live cash games including nl, limit, and mix games.  Yet through it all I think I maintained a very stable life for my family and myself (which is rare in this industry).

I've written articles for various poker magazines and online sites such as Cardplayer, Bluff, and PokerNews.  I've produced mid to high stakes videos for Cardrunners and I own my own training site [StackEm Coaching](http://stackemcoaching.com) . I also host my own web show over at Quadjacks called Cashplays where we discuss cash game strategy.  It is the most viewed and downloaded show on the site.  Currently I live in Las Vegas (been here for the past 9 years).

My two biggest accomplishments in poker are winning more money than the previous year 10 years straight ('98 to '08) and providing a nice life for my family and myself. I'm here to answer any questions and share my experiences and wisdom on what it takes to succeed in poker over the long run.

We'd got to the point where a couple of the players had only 10-15 big blinds left, and one of these players was next in the big blind. He proudly layed out his 8,000 chips which constituted his blind, and exclaimed to the table that if they wanted to play this hand 'it would cost them one hundred thousand chips!' because there was no way he was folding to any sort of raise with his short stack. As we were on the bubble at this point (top 6 get paid) it was clear he was hoping to pressure the table into giving him a walk.
He confidently looked each player in the eye as they passed their hands, reminding the table that it would 'cost them one hundred thousand chips' to see a flop. Action was folded all the way round to the small blind, who was a quiet Irish guy, not a reg at the casino. The big blind looked at him, repeating his warning: ''It's gonna cost you all these chips, son''.
 The Irishman looked down at both of his cards and without hesitation looked back towards the big blind and said ''Wrong. It's gonna cost YOU all those chips, son'' as he moved a tall stack of black 5k chips into the middle. The rest of the table simply observed in an awed silence.
 The loud guy on the big blind looked shocked and gingerly passed his cards into the muck. 
 The Irishman flipped up the deuce of clubs and took in the pot with a crooked smile on his face.
 I think it was the most epic thing I've ever seen on the poker table.

I am about to quit (playing full time at least) to start a business (well in 2014). I've made close to $750K profit playing cash games essentially bumhunting. I have a barely ever had any mtt scores barring 2 notable ones. While I never chose this as a job, I fell into it. I fell in love with poker became obsessed with becoming pro as I knew how flexible my hours and what sort of money I could make tax free. Ive not had a losing year but 2013 is proving my most troublesome, I'm barely breaking even. Games are tougher, too many pros hunting the same fish, not enough fish and lots of coutires regulations have meant that poker is practically dead, unless you are the elite (which I never profess to be, I just have disicpline and know who I can crush). Playing poker for a living while it seems glamours and everyone whos not into poker thinks your the luckiest guy on earth has many pitfalls. Firstly if you breakeven for months on end, you eat into your bankroll to pay your expenses. This is the single hardest thing. I have played as high as 10Knl and my main game has always been 1knl. I'm now finding that even with rigorous game selection, its very tough to swallow a 5bi loss in a day when you have a mortgage/bills and games are harder. Its like a constant uphill struggle and EVERYONE is feeling it. Ask me anything you like but I'm not giving out my SNs, I cba to post graphs but I could do later on. but I have maybe 1/2 of my hands stored which is about 400K hands winning $1 a hand up to the present day. Poker is a grind, it also is coming to its shelf life, unless of course your a prodigy and are a millionaire. Even though I've won near $1m I dont have that money due to expenses and its hard fucking work trying to stay afloat, and I'm sesnible. If I hadnt have been in my primitive years of poker I would be broke and out of the game. I am creating an exit plan for 2014 which I always wanted to do and poker enabled me to do it. I will say this, if I had run as bad as I have this year at the beginning wouldnt have turned pro woudlnt have been possible - so Im lucky. To anyone getting into poker, be careful 2013 is not the time to be doing it unless you have maybe 1 years worth of expenses and a decent BR and know what your doing. Questions? 

Because people dont believe me here is a pic of my last 400k hands, dunno time period maybe 3 years I lost roughly the same amount of hands on an old computer and didnt have it backed up :( - haters be quiet now :)

1334774205.0,37,self.poker,sgew7,"Pocket Queens, Preflop - A guide to Level 2 thinking for new players. 
",BrianBoyko,57,20,92,http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/sgew7/pocket_queens_preflop_a_guide_to_level_2_thinking/,"Okay, many in r/Poker will know that this is an ""obvious"" spot.  However, /r/Poker has a lot of people coming in who are beginners.  

I played this hand in a live mixed game last Monday and I wanted to illustrate a concept for the new players - Level 2 thinking. 

When you see a poker movie, you often see the hero somehow figure out exactly what his opponent has, like they can ""soul read."" And it's true, some players are so good at live tells that it can be uncanny.  Look at Daniel Negreanu playing heads up against amateurs on Million Dollar Challenge, for example.  

And ""tells"" do exist - shaking hands could mean a monster... or Parkinsons.  Legs wrapped around the chair legs could mean weakness - or it could mean the legs need a stretch.  

But for the most part, you're going to get the most information about your opponent's hand based on what he *does* rather than *how he does it.* 

There are many levels of poker thinking, but a beginner playing against other beginners only really needs to worry about three of them:

Level 0: ""I am not thinking about what I have."" 

Level 1: ""I am thinking about what I have.""

Level 2: ""I am thinking about what my opponent holds.""

Level 2 thinking is the biggest quantum leap that a new player can make.  It's the point where you stop ""playing cards"" and start ""playing poker.""  And Level 2 thinking can get you through *most* poker games against beginners with a positive balance. 

Here is an example of Level 2 thinking.

I'm playing in a mixed game, and it is the holdem round.  I've been pegged as very tight preflop, and people have literally been making jokes about me being the tightest person at the table.  

I'm sitting in the small blind with 9 players. We are all very deep stacked, I have about $180 in a $0.25/0.50 game!  There is no straddle on, so that's 360BB.  

The under the gun player limps (that is, he simply calls the $0.50 big blind.)  This sets up five limpers behind him who also call, all getting increasingly good odds on their money.  Then it gets to the button. 

The button (who I know little about but don't think he's been getting out of line) raises to $8.50.  This is a raise of 17 BB - and about twice what is currently in the pot.  The rule of thumb in many cases is to bet 3-5x the BB + 1 BB for every limper.  The button has now bet 9x the BB + 1 for every limper.  This is a very large raise compared to the size of the pot and the action before the flop.  

I now look at my cards, and see [Q](/hearts)[Q](/diamonds).  

QQ is a solid hand, it is literally the third best preflop starting hand in holdem, and is only beaten by two hands, AA and KK.  

I look at the raise by the Button, and it's clear that the raise was designed to knock out some or all of the limpers from the pot.  He does not want to play his hand multiway, which implies to me that I can eliminate some hands from his range.  Suited Ace-small, suited king-small, suited connectors, small pocket pairs - these are all hands that would want to raise, but keep the pot small.  I can eliminate these hands from his range.  He likely has two big cards - KQ, AJ+ or ATs+, or a medium-to-big pocket pair - TT+. 

Against that range, I am a clear favorite.  I also do not want to play the hand multiway, so I decide to make a bet that will further discourage the limpers to call.  I raise to $20. 

True to form, the limpers fold, and I am now heads up with the button.  I am out of position, but my hand is very strong - QQ is a monster preflop.  

However, the button decides to ""4-bet"" - or re-re-raise - to $60.  

With a high pocket pair in holdem, you typically want to get all the money in preflop, if you can. And I could easily re-re-re-raise all-in - the pot was big enough.  But this had me concerned, because a 4-bet range is much stronger than a raise's range.  What would the button do this with?  I can't see him doing this with TT or even JJ.  I can't see him doing this with AQ.  *Maybe* AQs... So that leaves AA, KK, and AK.  Against that range, I'm am either a small favorite (56% against AK) or a huge underdog (18% vs KK+).  

I decide to fold.  I'm not ""beating his range"" and he has made his 4-bet big enough that I can't afford to try to set-mine with queens.  

Level 1 thinking would have shoved. But thinking at level 2, this is an easy fold.  

Now, there were also level 3 considerations that I made during this hand, which is ""thinking about what your opponent thinks you have.""  I do know that my opponent pegged me as tight, and my 3-bet range, from the small blind, was probably TT+, AQs.  Because of the limpers, I don't think the button was putting me on a re-steal, as a steal probably wouldn't work against a field of limpers. So whatever he had can crush such a range - something like AQ/AJ would have probably seen the flop and tried to spike an ace. TT and JJ might call to set-mine. I myself would probably have flat called with AK or JJ in that spot. (in tournaments, it's an easy 4-bet, but in cash-games... but that's another topic for another day.) 

And it's true that he could be ""turning his hand into a bluff"" with something like AQs or JJ - a hand he now knows is beat, but against a tight player, he might get a laydown.  But I doubt it.  He's risking $60 to win $30, and I'm not folding there near often enough for that to be profitable for him.  

But level 2 thinking was enough to get me to fold my queens here.

I was just getting to the point where I was getting bored, but mostly trying to be too tricky.  I lost my game.

So 3 days ago, bored, with only 52 cents in my Sportsbook (merge network) account, I decided to play a freeroll.  There were over 4000 entries.  I have played in these a lot on merge (used to be almost everyday), and the furthest I ever got was the lowest payout (I think a 2.20 ticket).  I got third place!  The prize:  $9 in cash and an $11 ticket.  I promptly blew the $9 in the blackjack game on there (I know, I know, you don't have to tell me how stupid that is).

Then, yesterday, I had some free time, so I saw that there was a $11 satellite to the daily ""high roller"" $200+$15 tourney.  It was in late reg, but I still got in.  They payed about 9 spots, only the top 6 getting a $215 ticket.  I won second place (after 7th went out it was an all in fest anyways, with nothing more to gain).  I do have an interesting question about a play I made near the 7th place ""bubble"", but don't have time to post it right now.

Edit:  I made a [separate thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/nkl0i/satellite_tourney_bubble_playetiquette_question/) to discuss that hand.

I decided against playing the ""high roller"" that was playing that night.  I was tired, etc.  So, I decide to play tonight.  I fucking won the whole damn thing for $6600.00!  It is my single biggest tourney win, and puts me in the black for the year!  I can't fucking believe it!  I always hear those ""make a freeroll into a ton of money challenges/stories, and think they're impossible/bullshit, but I did it!

For the haters, here's a pic of my [hand history](http://imgur.com/i2AHD.png) screen showing the three tourneys in the last 3 days, and the [""congrats"" screen](http://i.imgur.com/V3HZm.jpg).  Unreal!

Edit: I have not played on-line in years.

Edit: Calling it a day. I'll check back in the morning.

Edit: Let me clarify a few things.  First the money, which I didn't think would be all that relevant really.  The period I tracked is 1/1/06 thru today.  That's really 6 years.  The total is really $181k and 1/3 of that is PLO.  So call it $20k a year in HE which maybe puts the skeptics at ease a little.

The real point: Those that know I do this have seen me develop into a solid player. They ask me questions that I won't really answer because I'm playing the next hand against them.  I enjoy going to Vegas and having conversations about my little rules because I will never see those people again.  And a lot of the conversations end with ""I'm telling you, I've got the data on that!"" and they laugh and call bullshit and we're all having a good time.  But I truly think I'm right with almost all of it. I might have the best database of live NL hands in the country.

8-handed table, starting stacks at $25.00, blinds were $.15/$.30. Top 2 places pay out $150/$50.

BTN: $???

SB: $???

**Hero (BB): $15.65**

UTG: $???

**UTG+1: $13.85 TAG**

**MP1: ~$35.00 LAG**

MP2: $???

**CO: $26.20**

Pre-flop, hero is BB with [](/Ad) [](/Qh) 
UTG Folds, UTG+1 calls, MP1 calls, MP2 folds, CO raises to $.60, Button calls, SB Folds, Hero calls, UTG+1 calls, MP1 calls. 

Flop: [](/Ah) [](/Kh) [](/6h) (5 players)
Hero raises $1, UTG+1 raises to $2, MP1 raises to $5, CO raises to $10, BTN folds, Hero **???**

My thoughts: It's pretty easy to see that, at the moment, my hand is beat even with TPTK. There's $21 in the pot and a call would leave me with $6.05 behind, which would definitely wind up going into the pot by the end. I've got the nut flush draw with two cards to go, and I can see that the TAG in UTG+1 has his mind set on going all-in anyway 

UTG+1 wouldn't be in the hand at all if he didn't have a middle pair or a decent ace in his hand. He would have definitely raised early on with any pair tens or above, so he doesn't have trips. If he's sticking around, his range is pretty much AK or a pair of sixes in the hole and that's it, but I don't think the sixes are likely. Either way, he's got me beat now, but loses to a flush, and he doesn't have a heart in his hand.) 

MP1 could have almost anything, but I'm guessing either the flush or a decent flush draw, so either one or two of my remaining hearts are in his hand.

The CO only raises to $10 if he's trying to discourage a flush draw. If he was on a flush draw, he would have called. He *did* raise pre-flop, so he probably has a pair or the remaining Ace (assuming that UTG+1 has the other), but if it's the Ace, he only bets into this pot with a high heart or a King as his other card. A(?) [J](/hearts) is the absolute bottom of his range here, but I don't see him making a weak raise in position pre-flop with any combination of the remaining hearts, and I don't see him trying to discourage flush draws if he's already got the flush with any of the hands he would have initially raised with. I figure his range is pretty close to 66, KK, AK, A[J](/hearts).

So the way I see it, there are anywhere from 6-8 hearts left in the deck giving me somewhere between 24% and 31% to win, nobody else is folding, and most of the cards that would pair the board at this point to make a boat are already in someone's hand. I could fold right now knowing that I'm beat, or I could shove and hope to quadruple up to be the big stack. What would you do in this situation?

I can post results later on if anyone's interested.

**Edit:** So for the results: Every other night, I would have folded this hand after the $5 raise, let alone the $10, but the next day was Easter, and we hadn't done our eggs yet, so I felt kind of guilty leaving my wife to the task, so losing wasn't a big concern for me. I shoved and got three callers. UTG+1 showed AK for two pair, MP1 had the flush with [10](/hearts) [3](/hearts), and the CO showed KK for the set. The turn and river were blanks, and MP1 took the pot. ",,False,,t5_2qhix,True,,,True,t3_rzon9,http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/rzon9/interesting_at_least_to_me_hand_for_analysis/,

TALKING POINTS:

As recently reported by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement, Atlantic City's collective casino revenue fell 8 percent in 2012, marking the sixth straight annual decline.

According to a 2010 study by Econsult, a regulated online gambling market could equate to anywhere between $210 million and $250 million in added grossrevenue for the state. The analysis also estimated that the industry could create up to 1,900 jobs.

The bill will directly increase Atlantic City’s revenue stream by requiring that all online gaming operators be restricted to land-based casinos in Atlantic City and casino operators would be required to obtain an online license (renewable on an annual basis) from regulators.

New Jersey is uniquely positioned to lead this innovative new industry and help run the operations for other states that will want to adopt similar structures moving forward.

Regardless of the player’s location within the state, all wagering will be deemed to have taken place where the casino’s server is located.

The bill allows for both interstate compacts and taking play from players in other countries as long as the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement determines that such wagering is not inconsistent with federal law.

I like poker. I have no credentials and grind microstakes when i have spare time. I write these guides when I hit a few coolers in poker and have nothing better to do. Still reading? Cool.

The general gist of poker guides for beginners is pretty standard ""raise large with a tight range, fold everything else. Value bet the pot whenever you hit top pair top kicker until the river."" It's a good guideline for crushing microstakes but it actually guides you away from the fundamentals of poker.... logic.

Instead of giving you a set guide of hand ranges and raise sizing for specific opponents, I plan to introduce you to the fundamental logical thought patterns so that you can adapt to situations yourself.


**Why raise?**

So you've probably heard from many many poker guides that raising preflop is the bomb. 
It is the bomb. The blinds represent players raising with a 100% preflop range. We make money off our opponents mistakes. It is almost never a mistake to check with 27o on the BB. Therefore we are not making money. 


But you can find the fundamental reasons for raising anywhere:
1. get value from weaker hands(&lt;50% equity against you)
2. get hands with equity against you to fold (this still counts for hands that have less than 50% equity against you)
3. deception (a lot less relevant in microstakes since your opponents are probably half drunk and therefore not trying to read you).

So when we raise preflop we are generally looking to either get value from weaker hands or just pick up the blinds. 


In truth, calling a preflop raise isn't bad. The reason people advocate 3betting so strongly in microstakes is that your opponents generally don't consider the option of 4betting. This means that they are often making mistakes when 4betting is the right move (and therefore you are making money). On top of this, most hands that are raising preflop have equity against you. This means you generally get a lot of fold equity from your raises. 


**Preflop raise sizing and ranges based on preflop stats:**

Okay, so most microstakes players suck. Having said that, atleast some of them will pick on raise sizing if you start raising 5BB with your good hands and 3BB with your high potentials (it may take them a while but they'll get there eventually). This is not what you want. If your opponent sees you bet 3BB and has picked up on this, not only does he know your range is wide (say 30%) but he also knows that the top portion of your range is taken off (now he's looking at a 15-30%). This is bad, this is the worst, you don't want this.

There are many ways to solve this. One is to polarise your preflop raise sizes (bet 5BB with your AA, KK, QQ, 67s, 22   and bet 3BB with KJ, KQ, JT etc.). 
What I like to do is just imagine the range i'm going to be playing in this situation and bet accordingly (i have super nits behind me that only see 10% of flops, I bet 2.5BB with AA on the button because that's how much I would bet with 48o to steal).

So how much do we raise?
Standard posts will tell you 4BB+1 for every limper (works very well 9 handed microstakes).

The correct answer is dependent on how much your opponents are willing got call.
Are your opponents willing to call 10BB with a 50% range? then you can profitably raise 10BB with a 25% range (1 opponent for simplicity)
Are your opponents willing to call 2.5BB with a 20% range? then you can profitably raise 2.5BB with a 100% range.

Obviously you also have to factor in their 3bet frequency etc. (prettty much if they start 3betting a lot just tighten up your range).  But this is the main idea. 
They call too much? Raise a tight range large. They fold too much? Raise a wide range small. 
They play weird ranges in between and 3bet weirdly? you work it out and if you can't either leave the table or just limit yourself to playing Aces against them.

The idea that you should have a standard raise size that you stick to forever is a very bad notion and will move you away from the logical thought processes needed in poker. How much should I raise and what should I raise? The answer is entirely player dependent and should vary substantially depending on the table dynamic. 



**Impact of Postflop Stats:**

First thing's first. Are you scared of playing your opponent(s) postflop? Leave the table and find an easier one. Or if there's only 1 shark and many fish. Avoid the shark like the promotional burgers at McDonalds. 

So, your decision on what to do cannot be determined by preflop stats? This is where most people fold. Marginal situations are where you lose money playing them while you're tired or on tilt or against a better opponent is bad. But you're a learning player! You've gotta take these marginal situations on if you want to learn quickly.

So... what postflop stats should impact your preflop decisions. I'll give you the easy ones you can work the rest out from there.

- your opponent folds to 3/4 pot bets on the flop if they don't connect. You can profitably raise 100% of hands with a large raise size and cbet the flop. (obviously you ahve to limit your range against multiple opponents) (also changes if they have something like a 10% preflop calling range as they will hit like 60% of the time.)
- your opponent always calls the flop bet but gives up on the turn if they miss. You can raise (or in some cases just limp) 100% of hands with a small raise size (and then 2 barrel bluff them). 

In fact, these are bad examples. If you have a dead read on your opponent like those. It's very easy to exploit them (and these reads are what you should be spending the majority of yoru time trying to find).
Pretty much for more complex situations try to stick to a principle that if he folds too much you want a lot of smaller pots with a wider range and if he calls or bets too much you want bigger pots with a tighter range.

While all of this is good info, it's NOT easily available on the sidebar. As a new US player, looking for info on who is playing what/where (are you on Carbon or Cake, if not those, who?) 

I did get a pre-paid visa this past weekend to deposit on a site, but I still haven't put it anywhere because I am still nervous about where to play and the legalities of it all. I would love to play on Stars again but I know that probably won't happen.

[Bitcoin](http://www.bitcoin.org/) is a distributed p2p currency that can be transferred from person to person with no record whatsoever. 

There would need to be an intermediate site that was hosted outside of the united states, but there is absolutely no way they could seize bitcoins (due to the way the mechanism works). Also due to it not being an official foreign currency I'm pretty sure they'd have a hard time prosecuting it. 

A second option for the use of bitcoin is to build it into the p2p system that bitcoin already runs on. Basically it would be like when they shut down Napster and everyone when to bittorrent and emule.. Without a centralized server there is noone to arrest, nothing to take down, and no way to stop it.

You can buy bitcoins with paypal, but someone needs to make a site that would track chip counts vs bitcoinsm, etc, etc..

I'm not sure how it would all work exactly, but the REALLY cool part about it is that bitcoins are a VERY finite currency. This means that people that got in the ground floor of this opportunity could get QUITE rich if online poker stars to migrate towards bitcoin. Because bitcoin is a finite currency and theres only so much being generated every day, the price of existing bitcoins would go through the roof as more and more people started to play bitcoin online poker..

Bitcoin is already a pretty established currency..

I'm a programmer by trade and really want to take up this idea because the demise of online poker is going to hurt one of my favorite things to do.

If any other programmres want to join me in this mission, please send me PM or post here with great ideas..
I'm trying folks!

I've been crazy busy with school and Dave (Hero CEO) has been busy with stuff on there, but we talked tonight and he gave me the green light to organize a freeroll league exclusively for r/poker members. 

I want to start it off a bit slow and see where it goes, but my initial idea is for a 4 week league with 3 $50 freerolls every Saturday. They would start at 1pm, 2pm and 3pm server time (which is now Central Time I think because of Daylight Savings) and there would be a $600 purse for the league leaderboard to be paid out at the end of the 4 week cycle. 

What do people think of this setup? Any ideas of how we could do it better? I think the 3x freerolls every Saturday is the way we are going to go, but if we have $300/week total between the freerolls and the leaderboard purse does this seem like a cool way to do it? If the league cycle is 12 tourneys how many should we count towards the leaderboard standings? Top 8 results for each player?

1376402719.0,27,self.poker,1ka0l5,Legit Challenges.,SwampJieux,44,17,143,http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/1ka0l5/legit_challenges/,"**Hello, /r/poker, let's actually get something going here.**

There is a ridiculous amount of pump-fake braggadocio and bluffing bravado going on ATM regarding heads up challenges. I won't name names but everyone knows what's up. So, why don't we consolidate a list of *actual legit challenges,* **show the money**, and get something rolling?

Simply put it's like this: Post your game here, who you'll play against, for how much money, when you're available and I'll set up an escrow. The person you call out can reply with ""accept"" or ""decline.""

Put your money where your mouth is and have your skill and luck tested or don't. Quite simple. No attempt to save face by pricing people out or pretending you had server issues. No bitching about game types. No excuses. Just accept, or decline. Think of this post as the brush - you don't whine to him. You don't cry because the only game you'll play isn't available.

The escrow I'll set up will be a dealer at Harrah's who'll hold the money for a %. I'm thinking 5% under $1,000 total and 3% if the prize is over that. If people want to make their own escrow arrangements then this thread can serve as a witness. In other words, make your own arrangements or have them made for you - no excuses. Challenges will be considered legit when the money is being held.

Here's an example post - and a 100% legit challenge:

* **I challenge /u/MaxMidget to a heads-up poker match.**
* Glove to the face: You nipple-phallused scallawag, you twice-humped daughter of a butt-fucked fatherless whore, I shall defeat thee on the felt battlefield at the time and day of thy choosing and shall wipe up my gravy with your yarbles.. if ya have any yarbles. ^^loveya,meanit
* Game type(s): 5Draw, PLO High, NLHE
* Challenge Structure: Each game for set stakes, winner of each game takes representative portion of the pot. Each game will be 1/3rd of the prize money. Scooping the series by winning all three awards a 10% bonus.
* Stakes: Let's keep it small, $100 per game. Frankly I don't expect to win any but the 5Draw you fucking demon you.
* Game structure: $4,000 in chips, 30 minute levels for NLHE and OH, $5,000 in chips for 5Draw and no levels for the first two hours. After that blinds double every half hour. }:-D
* Caveat: Players must wear bow ties and panama hats. If you win a pot with a full house and the pocket cards [6](/hearts)[9](/hearts) you must sing at least one line from The Love Boat theme song. The winner must buy the loser a beer. During breaks and between hands it will be considered good form to talk about how people who say how great they are at poker and how poor other people are at it and claim to be poker players are complete loserdouchefagtwats if they won't even play a game of poker with the people they talk to about it.
**ESCROW TYPE:** We live in the same town and you know my bankroll. Let's have fun man. Put my money in your wedding fund so I don't have to buy you a present.

Obviously this is a fun challenge but it exists as a legit challenge and an example of how to do this. Gentlemen, please PM anyone if you call them out. A general challenge may look like this:

* (link to paypal or escrow account screenshot
* I'm calling out /u/name or group of people (anyone over 21 / people who enjoy orange juice, anyone on this subreddit, anyone in my state, anyone who plays on site XYZ...)
* Game type
* Challenge format
* Stakes
* Offer good until 99:99 EST
* Insults if you want to, just for fun, not to be taken seriously
* Caveats or special orders

So, basically, this is the no-back-out space. Don't post without the money. I'm thinking of starting a subreddit just for this so I can delete posts by people who try to post without proof of the money, and have a sidebar that notes that posts are legitimate offers of business and backing out forfeits the money to the person you challenged.

So there it is, gents. Have at 'em.",,False,,t5_2qhix,False,,,True,t3_1ka0l5,http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/1ka0l5/legit_challenges/,

When you play a hand passively, you are advertising to opponents that you don't feel your hand is strong, and basically asking them to take pots away from you.

They THEY bet out, you call, and soon you're on the turn and river with a bloated pot facing a larger bet for much of your stack **and no idea what to do**, all because you took no initiative in the hand and did not give villain anything to respond to other than weakness.

If I can give most of you novices one tip you need to make a habit out of, one that will immediately pay dividends and put you in better spots, it's this: **Bet your flops, especially when you spike top pair or a strong draw, or you were first in with a raise. Keep the lead**.

Stop letting your fear induce passive lines that get you in trouble, and don't give me some bullshit that your check is a strategic decision. Most of you are checking the flop because you're chickenshit about villain stacking you with the nuts... but then you check/call off a bunch of your chips anyway, putting yourself in a worse, more expensive spot after giving villain a chance to outdraw or otherwise leverage the hand away from you.

You will get yourself in a lot less trouble when you bet your flops, bet your turns, bet your rivers. Most of the time, if you are beat, your villain will let you know sooner rather than later with a raise. And then you can get away from your hands having lost a lot less than if you had check called a bunch of chips away to get in a bad spot with no idea what's going on.

EDIT: These are guidelines, not absolutes. Anyone telling you they are absolutes and argues against them under that false premise a) has an axe to grind and b) has something to lose by you realizing the value of value betting your flops.

Also, [we now have a counter-thread for this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/1bntyr/in_light_of_the_just_bet_your_flops_post_a_lot_of/), one based completely around the aforementioned inaccurate assumption of absolutes.

Getting late and games are winding down game is playing 4 handed with myself(hero) and 3 other regulars.  Villain is probably a slightly winning regular who is OK,  a little on the tightish/passiveish side but by no means a nit.  

Hero has probably been getting the best of villain in the last hour or so, and has been 3betting the shit out of his opens with position with anything playable.  Villain has been mostly folding to the reraises, or calling and playing straightforward postflop.

You've broken me (rant),SockBramson,64,30,120,http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/ycf9d/congratulations_live_poker_youve_broken_me_rant/,"Remember online poker? Remember when you took a bad beat, hell you took 20 bad beats, and you laughed it off and fired up more MTT's or SNG's? That's what I miss.

If you were an MTT/SNG specialist online and live in a jerkwater town you can go fuck watermelons when it comes to playing the tournaments you love.

Today I hit my breaking point. After 10-cashless tournaments against what has to be the softest field of poker players imaginable I'm out. I just can't win.

Can anyone calculate the odds of losing all of these hands? You'll notice a progression.

**EXIT #1:** Move my short stack in from the button with 22. BB snaps me off with AKo.

22 = 52.75%
AK = 46.67%

Flop = K-K-Q

Lost a flip. Pretty standard stuff.

**EXIT #2:** Final table. Stack around 12k. Blinds 1k/2k. Folded to me in the SB. Look down at 66. Jam. BB snaps me off with AKs.

66 = 52.27%
AK = 47.27%

Flop = K-K-Q

Again. Pretty standard stuff. Losing two flips in a row isn't a big deal.

**EXIT #3:** Final table. Getting short. MP player limps and I jam AJs from the cutoff for about 7BB's. MP player calls with 33. Maybe after losing the first two with the small pair I'll win here and have a decent stack at the final table.

AJs = 49.37%
33 = 50.04%

Flop = J-T-3

Wtf. Let me win any of these 3 hands and I'm in the money and battling for a top 3.

**EXIT 4:** Final two tables. I have about an average stack with 10k. With blinds at 200/400 I make a raise UTG to 1050 with AA. Folded to the BB who has me covered and monkey jams, I snap him off. He shows JJ.

AA = 80.94%
JJ = 18.65%

Flop = 3-8-J

**EXIT #5:** Final two tables. Getting short around 6k at 200/400. UTG+1 raises to 1200. I look down at two red Aces and 3-bet to 2550. Guy at the table actually says out loud, ""He must have AA."" Yeah they're not too keen on poker etiquette. Folded back to the raiser who asks how much I have behind. I think he saw that on TV or something. I tell him 4k-ish and he pushes out a stack to put me all in. I call and he turns over [Q](/diamonds) [J](/diamonds)

AA = 81.26%
QJdd = 18.30%

Flop = [8](/diamonds) [T](/diamonds) [J](/spades)

WTF.

AA = 46.26%
QJs = 52.83%

Turn = [9](/diamonds)

Drawing dead.

One guy at the table shouts at the guy ""YOU ARE A FUCKING IDIOT!"" At least that was funny. I just wish everyone good luck and leave.

**EXIT #6:** Final two tables. By this point I haven't won an all-in or any hand at showdown in more than two months. After stealing some blinds with shoves I have 8k with blinds at 400/800. UTG+1 is a big stack who raises to 2300.

I look down at [A](/clubs) [K](/clubs) and 3-bet shove.

Back on him he tanks but finally says, ""I can afford it."" and calls. He shows [A](/hearts) [2](/hearts)

AKs = 66.86%
A2s = 26.65%

Flop = [4](/hearts) [6](/hearts) [2](/spades)

Come on man this isn't even fair.

Turn = [7](/hearts)

Drawing dead on the turn again.

**EXIT #7**

There were an unbelievable amount of idiots in attendance today. Saw a guy cold call a 4-bet for half his stack and then check/fold a flop saying ""Had sixes."" A guy I recognize as being particularly atrocious gets moved to my left.

Blinds are 200/400 I have 6k. UTG limps, SB limps. I look down at KK in the BBand raise to 1350. UTG calls, SB folds.

Flop = 8-9-T.

Pot is 3100, I bet 2200. He jams obviously I call because I'm committed. I'm thinking I'm probably in bad shape with the super-wet flop.

He shows A9o

Really? How could anyone think they're good there or I'd fold. This guy is a regular. How could anyone with a brain make a play that bad?

KK = 77.27%
A9 = 19.70%

Turn = J

KK = 88.64%
A9 = 11.36%

River = A

I flew out of my seat. This is enough for me.

Seven tournaments without winning a showdown or an all-in. The worst shape I put myself in was a slight underdog?

I know in the grand scheme of things this shouldn't bother me. Like I said before, online this is nothing. You take 30 bad beats and just fire up 30 more tournaments.

This is different. I'm driving 45 minutes to get it all-in against morons who just crush me with whatever garbage hands they can muster.

I also I know what I sound like a total asshole but believe me when I say I'm not and this is just frustration. I smile, I make polite small talk. I take my beats like a man. I always say, ""good luck everyone"" and shake the hands of whoever extends them. I don't call people idiots when I see atriciously played hands every single hand.

But I'm just boiling.

It's like the ant the grasshopper.

The ant spent the summer storing up food for the winter while the grasshopper laid about doing whatever the fuck he wanted and getting drunk.

Then the winter came. The grasshopper was drunk out of his mind and starving for food. So he stumbled around and tripped over his own legs and fell right through a wall into the ants food storage place. He landed on the ant crushing his spine so the ant couldn't move. The ant could only lay there, paralyzed, in indescribable agony as the grasshopper ate all his food and jerked off to the picture of the ant's girlfriend on the wall.

That's me. I'm the ant. ",,False,,t5_2qhix,False,,,True,t3_ycf9d,http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/ycf9d/congratulations_live_poker_youve_broken_me_rant/,

1336596239.0,33,self.poker,tfa9t,How I Stopped Tilting,7trXMk6Z,41,8,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/tfa9t/how_i_stopped_tilting/,"I used to tilt.  A lot actually.  I still do sometimes, but it's far less often and the consequences far less disastrous.   As Tommy Angelo said, nobody is tiltless but everybody can tilt less.

I didn't have a particular path, I just had to always work on it.  Most of my poker buddies think that I don't tilt and they ask me how I do it.  I tell them the truth, it took me nine years of working on it, and it's still there (to a much smaller extent).

My previous coach insisted it was as easy as ""not accepting that from yourself, you're better than that"".  Others suggested that the stakes were too high because if you care about the outcome that much, then you're putting too much on the line.  Still others suggested that my outside life was causing it and I needed to fix my life or meditate or do whatever to make it so that when I was at the table I had no concerns or outside reasons to tilt.

As far as I can tell these are all very valid reasons and all in part true and helpful.

I think the fixing my life one was the most useful.

Poker is much less stressful if your life is good and you have enough money or outside income that the session really doesn't matter.  Grinding rent money at 25nl and 50nl was pretty stressful, and I actually practiced a lot at not tilting during that time, which is probably why it's so much easier for me to not tilt now, with things so much better in life.

I can't say for sure what did it, but I know that early on, with effort, I was finally able to feel the tilt creeping in, in the back of my mind.  The frustration, worry and panic, guilt, anger, all swirling around in the back of my head-- I could feel it coming on.  So the first thing I did was learn to sit out before it overtook me and my play.  The next thing I did was to see it coming on, and push it back-- to take pride in being able to recognize my emotional state and not let it affect my play.  So I'd feel it coming on, and resolve to play 1 more orbit of solid tilt-free play and THEN sit out.  Then 2 orbits.  Then eventually I could still feel it sitting there in the back of my mind, and I was still in a miserable state, but I wasn't making godawful spewtarded ships.  I was ""soft tilting"".  The kind of tilt where you don't realize it unless you look at your session in Poker Tracker and wonder why the fuck you were so passive the entire second half of the session.  The kind that makes you break-even at live play for 3 months before you even realized there was a problem.

So I realized that I was still not playing my best, but I wasn't sure what to do about this.  I still don't know.  So I worked on my A-game (you know, strategy stuff, the kind of stuff that's useful when you are playing well), and hoped that my rote technical skill would be enough so that even my soft-tilt game would be a solid winner.  This actually worked reasonably well, and I think my technical skills at NLHE are very very good.

But then a few years ago, I started trying to work on my LIFE.  Get in shape, make more money, get out and be more sociable, etc.  The standard things people work on when they're pumped up.  I haven't fixed all of it to a satisfactory level yet, but I'm working on it, and I'm reasonably proud of my self and my life and my person.  And for the past year or so, my poker has been really really good.  And virtually tilt-free, even of that ""soft"" tilt.  And only recently did I realize why-- it's all the reasons that people were initially telling me, but finally fully internalized.

I know for a fact that I'm by far the best player at every table I sit at, and I honestly would be embarrased for myself if I were to just tilt and play poorly.  I am above it.  I can crush these people, there's just no reason to tilt.  It's beyond silly to tilt.

Even though the money does mean something, I have enough friends with couches to sleep on, enough borrowing poker, and a few useful vocational trades that will always be needed (like DEALING poker--the WSOP needs like 1000 dealers every summer)... in short, I will never be on the street, and the absolute worst that will happen is I work or deal or sleep on a friend's couch playing on borrowed money for a few months until I scrape up enough to grind 50nl online or 1-2 live again.

To be sure, it's a crappy living and I wouldn't enjoy it, and if I was there, I would immediately be finding other ways to get myself back into a better situation-- but it IS there, it IS available, it IS me making my OWN way in life, and I did it for YEARS early on, so it's not like I'm above it or something.  I know I can do it, I've done it before.

So the worst cas scenario is that I'm set back a few years in my life.  Doing what I did before.  It sucks, but it's not the end of the world.  And realizing that that was the aboslute worst case scenario was pretty damned comforting.  The worst that can happen is I'm back where I was at.  That's a pretty good ""worst"".  And I realized that it was that realization that was allowing me to play so tilt-free.

Not only am I above tilt, and better than everybody, and would be embarrsed to tilt, I really and truly DON'T care about the outcome of the hand.  It just doesn't matter.  At all.  If I lose every single hand I play, I'll be fine.  Now when I play, I truly feel transcended above the table.  Like the act of playing is weird experience now.  I remember when I started out, playing 1-2 at the MGM in Vegas, losing 2 buyins in a day was a disaster.  Like I couldn't imagine varience beyond that at all.

Nowadays I'm frequently in a game for 3-6 maximum buyins and ready to dig for more.  I'm often in a game for four buyins, sitting on six, and end the night up 3 or 4 buyins.  Wins and looses like that used to be unfathomnable to me when I started out playing live.  I  was in a 1-2 friendly home game for 2400 and was very proud of myself for ending the night only -1200.  All my friends there were blown away and thought I had serious problems.

If putting my stack in gives me a 1% edge, the money goes in the middle.  I just don't even care.  People at the table are often shocked at how often and easily I can put my money in the middle, but I mean, the right play is the right play, and as I said, I just don't care if I lose it.  With this attitude, I've taken more shots, played much higher and built my roll up very quickly, and now am firmly entrenched in mid and high stakes games.  But if I lose it all, that's fine too.  I've put enough away in savings and other investments, and at the very worst, I can always go grind low stakes again.  The world won't end, and it's been a fun ride.

I just feel completely at peace with life and my poker and I know I can and will make the right play and I know I will always be fine in life.  That peace and knowledge I believe is what has helped me not tilt (or tilt very little).

I hope my story is helpful.  I don't really have specific advice, but I'm hoping that path that I took will give you some ideas of ways to help tilt in your game.

If anyone is interested in signing up for the beta go to http://www.bitcoinpoker.net/ and go ahead and sign up.
We will be sending out announcements in short order.

You'll notice that there are no ads on the site and I plan to keep it that way, I also don't plan to take a rake as I think the scarcity of bitcoins will make them go up in value as more and more people are attracted to online poker using bitcoins.

One thing that will be incredibly useful are any initial bitcoin donations for cashouts and promotions, etc.. We need to have a stable pool of bitcoins for the initial startup and unfortunately we've only been able to procure a very limited supply (though transactions for more are processing)

The best thing that you can do to help right now if you're not a programmer is to spread the word that this thing is under rapid development and will be off the ground shortly.

Right now encourage everyone you know who plays online poker to watch the bitcoin video and learn how the system works. Also encourage people to go ahead and pick up 10 BTC or so for themselves now.. 

I know that one of the fundamentals of poker is knowing when to throw away a losing hand, and this whole thing may seem like a backdoor flush draw.. but it's the best idea I could come up with and it's better than doing nothing!

See you at the tables soon!

Please down-vote and ignore if you don't enjoy these kinds of stories. 

So, tonight I got to feel what run bad is like. I'm playing a very, VERY deep stacked $2/5 game (plays more like a $5/10). As for image, I tend to get little respect because I do bluff in good spots to do so, the woman to my right is on tilt and is particularly out to get me. 

Attempting to recall the hand from memory a few hours later, I didn't write it down. The board is 100% correct.

Mississippi straddle to $10 BTN. SB and BB complete. I make it $50 with JJ from UTG. 5-6 callers pre-flop (couple guys behind, BTN, SB, BB villain, and us). 

Flop comes AJ8r. I cbet and get called by just the BB, who is a drunk female on a bit of tilt. The turn is an A. Absolutely perfect for us, I don't think she's ever folding Ax here given the history and her level of intoxication, and Ax is a huge % of her range. I jam into the ~$1000 pot. Now, we're actually $2250 effective behind, but I didn't realize she was quite this deep, she was on my immediate right and had a $500 chip and a couple $100 chips where I couldn't see them. I wanted a slight overbet to make it look bluffy, but this was actually bigger than I thought. 

In any case, she tank calls with A3. I think you know where this story is headed, I run it once and see a 3 on the river. She starts howling like a banshee and sounds like she's literally having an orgasm. This is odd for me, she usually has a lot of class at the table, probably the tilt plus the alcohol. Just absolutely no class.

The win? I didn't tilt. Not even a little bit. Tap the table, say nice hand, and keep playing my A game. I've been focusing on improving my mental game and it seems to have paid off. I'm sitting at home writing this right now and I'm not upset, I feel fine. It's a nice feeling that's subdued a bit by the big loss. 

In a card game where running good or bad can have such an impact on your short-term results, controlling your mental game is so key. I highly recommend you work on it guys, tilt is a real BR killer.",,False,,t5_2qhix,False,,,True,t3_1dur5v,http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/1dur5v/a_mental_game_victory_but_a_sad_result/,

This weekend went to a casino that I hadn't played at for over year.  Friday night I managed to lose about $140, but I made a note that this place seemed to have attracted a collection of some of the dumbest players I had ever seen.

So I was right back there Saturday night, managed to recover my $140 loss, and added about $750 profit on top of it.

But back to how not to make money at a soft table:

A young hillbilly type guy with a strong country accent sat down at the table.  He started ordering beers two at time, and was generally whooping it up, good times saturday night style.  He rather quickly got loosened up with the alcohol, and in loud drunk fashion announced ""He was just there to have a good time"" (sober translation: I want to lose all my money).

He went through about 2 buy-ins, and on his third buy-in pulled a suck out or two, and was probably sitting on about $500 which he was just starting to spew back to the table.  Two grumpy old men at my end of the table starting complaining and griping and making complaints to the dealers about the now quite drunk hillybilly's antics and loud boisterious talk.  Hillybilly started getting pissed, and was making comments like ""I thought we were here to have fun, I ain't gonna play at a table if we ain't all having fun"".

I was cracking some jokes with the guy (and taking the large portion of his chips) and generally keeping everything light hearted.  I told him ""Don't pay attention to those old sour pusses, they never had fun like us guys"".

A little while later I excused myself from the table to take a smoke break, and as I was walking out of the room by the front podium, the dealer that had just rotated out from the table was talking to the floor.  Seems several of the old grumpy players were wanting the guy removed from the game because of his loud talk and drunken manners, and for dropping the occasional f-bomb.

As I walked by the floor was saying, ""Well, it didn't help when the waitresses were bringing him beers two at time...""  I quickly interjected myself into the conversation and told the guy, ""As long as he has a big pile of chips in front of him, you can bring him beers three at a time for all I care.  If you pick him up out of the game, then I'm going to be pissed."" and went for my smoke.

Drunk hillbilly went broke shortly after and managed to lose about $600 to the table, instead of getting picked up like ""grumpy old guys who don't want to make money in a soft game"" wanted when he still had $500 in front of him.

Why don't people like money?

**The Pair vs Pair Paradox**


Posted: 2005-12-07 09:20 



One of the most frustrating things in Hold 'Em is getting a good pocket pair, seeing all lower cards come on the board, and still losing at showdown to a higher pocket pair or a lower pocket pair that hit a set. 



After a while it can seem odd. You don't get pairs that often, and when you do it seems that other players have pairs more often than what ""feels right."" 



The odds you'll be dealt a pocket pair in Hold 'Em is once out of every 17 hands, or 5.8%. So you don't seem them that often. 



Because you only see a pocket pair 5.8% of the time in your own hand, the mind naturally assumes since this is an infrequent event, you will not be likely to face another pair. Plus with any ten handed Hold 'Em hand, the odds that more than one player is dealt a pocket pair is 11.4%. 



So, the odds of you getting a pocket pair is 5.8% and the odds of more than one pocket pair on the table is only 11.4%. So why do you see opponents with pairs so often? 



The simple reason is that it happens more often than you think it should. Once you receive your cards and see a pocket pair, the odds another player has a pocket pair are 42.5%. 



You read that right. The odds of more than one player on a ten-handed Hold 'Em table receiving a pocket pair is 11.4%. But when YOU see your pocket pair, the odds of another player holding one is 42.5% 



This is what we call the Pair vs. Pair Paradox. Its not really a paradox, this is just how numbers work. And when these things happen, some players begin to suspect foul play or that the site is dealing rigged hands. 



Lots of players who worry about a site dealing rigged hands typically complain that a site ""doesn't feel right."" As we've discussed, the evidence coming from people worried about poker sites cheating by scripting how the cards are dealt is scant. Most of the concern is based on ""hunches."" And ""paradoxes"" like this create those ""hunches"" and ""feelings."" 



But the ""feeling"" that opponents too often have pairs the same time you do is wrong -- unless you ""feel"" that it should happen about 42% of the time -- typically far above what many would estimate. 



The REASON for this is that once you look down at your pocket pair, we've already reached the first step in the probability equation that showed the 11.4% chance more than one player have pocket pairs. Once you see your pair, there is now a 100% chance that YOU have a pocket pair. And now there are nine other players who each individually have an approximate 5.8% of having one. 



Think about it this way: 

What are the chances of you flipping a coin HEADS three times in a row? 

Simple answer: 50% * 50% * 50% = 12.5% 

What are the chances of you flipping a coin HEADS three times in a row after you've already flipped HEADS twice in a row? 

Simple answer: 100% * 100% * 50% = 50% 

The bottom line: When you have a pocket pair in Hold 'Em, the chances another player on your 10-player table also has a pocket pair is over 42%. When you see those hands, don't think the site is rigging the deal to build pots. Think that this is how things work in a random system.

**Part 1: First Week.**

As my last WSOP trip reports on TwoPlusTwo were so well received, I decided for this year I would do another one. A friend of mine, and writer for QuadJacks, Luke Haward, has kindly agreed to edit and write up my trip reports which I will be frantically scribbling in-between some sessions on the felt. My updates will contain analysis of the major hands I get involved in, stories about the players I meet on and off the felt, as well as my thought processes and feelings as I pit my energies and poker skills against huge fields of players live in Vegas in an effort to achieve my first six figure score and that compelling WSOP Gold Bracelet. 

For those of you who don't know me, my name is Ryan Laplante and I'm an MTT pro originally from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. I'm better known in poker circles by my Pokerstars and TwoPlusTwo screenname - Protentialmn. I'm glad to have you with me on this journey as I try my best to achieve my dream of becoming more than just another MTT grinder. Maybe if I bring my A game and have a bit of luck, I'll achieve my first Gold Bracelet and be able to call myself a World Series of Poker Champion! Thank you for reading and best of luck at the tables!

**May 30th (Day 1, Event 3a)** 

I doubled up in the second hand of my first tourney, day 1a of a $1k 3-day NL event, with my AA vs JJ. The hand folded to the CO who opened with a 4bb bet of 100 chips, I raise to 300 from the BB, and he calls. The flop comes 2 2 7 twotone, I continue for just over half the pot, he raises to 750, I jam my stack in the middle and he snap calls it off with JJ and doesn't make his 2-outer to survive.

My day 1a table draw was full of randoms and very soft, also a fairly quiet table. I was moved after a couple of hours, along with one of the chattier guys from my previous table, a really nice guy from D.C. There were two dudes at the new table who obviously knew each other and were a lot of fun. Whenever we had a good looking female dealer they made a lot of jokes and were hitting on her and getting badly denied, it was pretty amusing. 

Melanie Weisner was then moved to our table, and she and I discussed hands a decent amount while the guys on either side of her hit on her and made jokes. I know her boyfriend Rupert fairly well, so we had a decent amount of real life stuff to talk about. We also played an interesting hand last year in the 5k where she ripped me off of top pair with a great triple barrel bluff. 

After a while she ended up having her AA cracked to bust in a fairly sick spot. By the time Melanie busted I had been chipping down for some time and was sitting on about 10 big blinds at 150-300. When the final level hit, at 200-400 I was down to 2400 chips or 6 big blinds. I finally had a run of decent action at this point, winning a flip, busting an even shorter stack, and then winning another flip to get back up to 16,700 or 42 big blinds, and ended the night with that. Made day 2 with just above average stack and 30bbs to work with. 

**May 31st (Day 2, Event 3)**

http://img703.imageshack.us/img703/4998/playingwithphelps.jpg

My starting table draw for Day 2 included none other than Michael Phelps! While I wasn't able to play with him long as he busted fairly quickly, I was once again reminded of one of my favourite things about poker in Vegas; The opportunity to play not only with legends of the game, but also celebreties and people from many walks of life is truly an astounding feature of these major live tournaments. WSOP really brings out the craziest variety of people you will ever play with, from John the carpenter, to Michael the greatest swimmer to ever live. You never know who you're going to meet, or what may happen. 

Not long after Phelps busted, Scott Seiver was moved to our table. Scott is considered by many to be one of the greatest NLHE players in the world, and is also an incredible person, as I'll go on to explain. I was absolutely shocked to see him sitting in a 1k, having assumed he'd be crushing the big cash games running through the summer and only be playing the bigger buy-in events. It occurred to me that he might have some kind of bracelet bet running, but when I quizzed him on this he just told me he was in love with the very concept of the World Series, and just wanted to win another bracelet really badly, not really caring about the money. This commitment to playing for pure glory and for the game itself earns my respect far more than his ability alone. When you add the fact that he comes off as a genuinely good guy, you have the makings of highly entertaining table draw, provided you're not seated directly to his right!

The way that Scott got started in poker is less surprising once you've met him and realized what a mind he has. Scott told me a story about his college days at Brown University around 8 years ago, about an occassion when the then President Clinton came to Brown to give a speech. After the speech, one of Scott's friends recognized the legendary poker player Billy Gazes in the crowd and approached him, somewhat star struck at seeing such a prolific player at their school, he nonetheless plucked up the courage to start chatting with him. Not long after, Scott was also introduced and a group of them went out to dinner. 

Over their dinner discussion, Billy realized right away how intelligent Scott was and how his mind would be great for the game of poker, and so on the spot Billy decided to stake Scott $20,000, who was at the time a broke college junior with less than $500 to his name. One of the first games Scott ever played on this stake was the Sunday Million on Party Poker, the first tourney with a $1 million guarantee to ever run on the site, and he managed to make his way to the final table for a score of around $35,000! The rest, as they say, is history. 

I managed my best to stay afloat at the table that included Seiver. After we broke and I got moved to a new table I managed to build for a bit. I managed to peak at around 45k at 800-1600, and then got into a BvB confrontation with 88 vs KQs in a 100k pot. As my snowmen were unable to hold in the flip, I was turned into a short stack, and not long after busted in 103rd place (out of 3200 runners) for $2,900. 

Most people would be upset to run fairly deep in a WSOP event and not have much to show for it, but I was actually very happy to have my first event of the summer go so well! 

Maybe it was a sign for what the series had in store for me…

**June 1st (Event 6)** 

I sat down for flight A of the $1.5k 'Millionaire Maker' with a tantalizing $1 million guaranteed for first place, and immediately noticed a line of four professionals to my left, and two to my right, including the fabulous Xuan Liu. While a fairly challenging table draw, it was a fun one, and I had the opportunity of hearing about the history of the games in L.A. and Vegas from a live pro who's played as high as the 100-200 nlhe/plo mix cash games.

I was busted in a totally standard spot, and re-bought expecting my next draw to be much softer than my first. I couldn't have been more wrong. My flight B draw had the following players on it; Darryll Fish (who has just taken 3rd place in the 5k 8max for 215k), OnCommand (who also final tabled the same tourney for around 70k), the world famous Yevgeniy Timoshenko (or JovialGent online), one of the best online MTT-ers as well as an extraordinary live player, Tony Cousineau, one of the top WSOP cashers of recent times, and Dan Suied, who goes by the nickname Miami Boss and is good friends with Darryl. There were in fact only two people at the table who I figured might not play full time, neither of whom played poorly. 

As you can imagine, Darryl and OnCommand were happy about their 8max final table scores and were celebrating their success by drinking beers and doing shots. Miami Boss was joining in, as well as some others at the table, and on nearby tables as well as on the rail, which included Jason Mercier. Our table was wild, hilarious and probably the most fun I have ever had at a poker table. I was literally blinded by tears of laughter multiple times. 

One of the funniest moments of the night was when we started playing the meta-game of 'show one card if you win a pot'. One of the main players in the hand was Miami, the entire  night he acted like a ""player"",  and he had the letters WSOP shaved into his head (though half covered by a cap) and kept repeating some sort of catchphrase or mantra about ""popping models and bottles"" through the night and showing people the “hot” girls he would party with. 

The hand that occurred Miami Boss opened in middle position for just over a min raise, and finds himself facing a snap jam from a kid in the small blind. Both players have about 20bb in their stacks, and Miami when he sees the jam starts to tank and talk fast about how this kid who had jammed was the quietest player at the table and also had been the tightest by far. 

After a few minutes of thinking and talking through it all aloud, he held his cards high up in the air and looks over at Darryl, saying something about having to fold. I'm pretty sure Darryll caught a glimpse of his cards, as he made a really funny face and then snap covered his face with his hands and started giggling like a little kid. They were both fairly drunk at this point. Miami finally does fold, showing his hand to Darryll once again as he does so.

1353866478.0,29,self.poker,13rm6u,Calling Pre-flop with Suited Connectors in Multi-Way Pots,MaestroOfMirages,31,2,61,http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/13rm6u/calling_preflop_with_suited_connectors_in/,"ChipChase, schrapa and CardCounter0 had a discussion concerning suited connecters in a [thread made by Southrawrea](http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/13qdw8/was_it_right_to_raise_otf/) where Southrawrea calls in position with 87s versus a field of players.

CC makes the case that the play is overall negative EV and the hand should be folded pre-flop. 

If your default strategy is to call, then you are essentially playing for implied odds (I/O) only. Any pair you make will be weak in a multi-way pot and, let's be honest, hitting two pair or trips shouldn't even be a consideration since it rarely happens.

I agree with CC on folding and the reasons are simple: (1) you don't have any fold equity and (2) the stack-to-pot ratio (SPR) is going to make your life a living hell on the flop. Let me explain, because like many things in poker ""it depends"" on the circumstances.  

Villain raises 4bb, 3 callers and you're on the button with 87s. What's your game plan? If you call, the pot on the flop will be 4x5 + 1.5 = 21.5bb. _Assuming effective stacks are 100bb before the hand starts_, the SPR on the flop will be (100-4)/21.5, around 4.5. That's a horrible SPR for drawing hands. 

Suppose you flop a flush draw, you're getting ~1:5 to hit on the turn. In today's games you can expect villain to fire a cbet of say ~15bb. You need to make 15x5-(15+21.5) = 38.5bb to break even with the call (more if you include rake). If you call the cbet, your stack shrinks to 96-15 = 81bb on the turn.

The math looks good right? Wrong. You're forgetting the most important thing in poker: villain's range. 

Villain's cbet range is pretty wide (even really bad players are cbetting these days), so when you call on the turn you're basically gambling that he has a hand good enough to call a 40bb bet (assuming you hit on the turn). If you miss and villain bets, you're screwed, he essentially shuts you out of the hand. 

Now many of you will say that (1) the other players in the hand will increase your I/O to a point where calling is +EV overall or (2) since villain's range is wide, you can float his cbet and try and take it away on the turn if her checks. Both these are valid points but, again, there's a problem. 

The worst case scenario is your up against a bigger flush draw, or your straight outs will be tainted by someone else having a flush draw. Reverse I/O in full effect. Note that these are all very probable in given it's a multi-way pot.  

Another thing to consider is that the other (3+) players won't let you get to the turn. Online games are really aggressive, they aren't like low stakes live games. This further decreases your I/O. 

I left some stuff out (ex: playing with 150bb+ stacks), but will follow through if anyone else posts their thoughts.

So, what does /r/poker think? Please keep it friendly :)

Even still, something Abe Limon said on this week's Seat Open Podcast (formerly Deuce Plays, and still hosted by Bart) really resonated with me. During the interview, Bart and Limon had made a brief segue from poker to prop bets, and Limon was talking about all the action he gets on various prop bets against high-stakes recreational poker players (in this case, bets about the upcoming election). A point he made about the prop bets took them right back into a discussion about PLO, as it rings just as true. The relevant part (beginning around the 23-minute mark):

&gt; If I take a bet with a guy on Obama...and then I see him a little while later and he says, “You know, I’ve figured out that you got the best of that bet, but anything can happen, and so you shouldn’t be so happy to think that you’re going to win.” **I’ll tell him, “I already won. I cannot lose.”** And it boggles their mind — they cannot possibly fathom what I am saying, **but what I’m saying is: once you take the worst of it, you’ve lost, and I’ve won.** I don’t care what the freakin’ outcome is because over my life and your life, we’re going to make a lot of decisions, and we’re going to be in the long-run on these decisions, so whenever you make a decision where you take the worst of it you’ve lost already. And, your average person just can’t even begin to wrap their mind around this concept, and that’s why they get themselves in these situations over and over again, and hope for that one lucky card that’s going to bail them out.

The total prize pool for the 4 week series is $1200, with 3 $50 freerolls each week and a $600 prize pool for the overall leaderboard. You can check out the page over at http://www.heropoker.co.uk/en/leaderboards/reddit-ranking for updated rankings, upcoming tourneys in the series, payouts, point structure and all of the rules. Everything you need to get into the tourney is over on that page under the rules tab. Hope everyone is as excited as I am for this, I got Dave (Hero Poker's CEO) to put 7 minute levels on the tourneys, so there will be more play and we can really get some good smack talk and rivalries going! See you guys at the tables Saturday!


Note: Only those players from the following regions are eligible to play to reduce international freeroller abuse:
North America, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland. Let me know if you are in another country and want to play so I can talk to Dave about adding that country. Just send me a message on here!


If you have any questions, feel free to ask here and I'll do my best to answer or I'll ask Dave if I don't know the answer.

River Th. BB thinks for 10-15secs, and shoves $150ish in the pot.

Once a month we might have a tourney, but we were all about the cash game. We were out in a garage where you could drink and smoke and we'd play some Friday nights until the sun came up. It was only a 25¢/50¢, $20 min buy in game but it played like $1/$2 and the biggest cash out any one person had was over $1,500 and we'd usually have up to 3 full tables of guys show up to play.

The best hand I've ever seen play out, I haven't even seen repeated online or on television. 

I'm action and I look down at AA. I know my table is full of maniacs, so I limp knowing someone will raise and I'll punish them back. 2 seats after me raises to $5 (pretty standard at our game.. 3x the bb will just get everyone to call). Directly across the table re-raises to $30. the BB next to me goes all in for $125. I go all in for $225. The original raiser only has about $50 in front of him so he goes all in. 

Back to the guy across from me who has about $250 in front of him. ""Jimmy... you're the only fly in the ointment for me"" ""I know you don't make that move without AA or KK and I'm sitting on QQ"" ""I said you're right Scotty... you should lay them down"" (we allow chatter at our cash games.. even about our hands) he says ""Show me?"" I said ""I can't do that Scotty... there are other people with money in the pot... but I'm telling you... you should lay it down"" (I don't like that I have 2 all in with me... I certainly don't want a 3rd). He says ""I call""

By now, the other 2 tables have stopped playing to come over to see this pot. Everyone turns over their hands. Original Raiser 88. Scotty across from me QQ and bb has KK. I show my AA. Here comes the flop... 1 by one.. 1st card - 8 ""OOOOhhh"" ... 2nd Card Q ""OOOOOOOHHHHH"" .. 3rd card A and the place loses it's fucking mind. My wife complained later that she could hear us in the house. 

Turn brings... A giving me quads and sealing the fate for everyone... and I drag a massive pot (well massive by my family guy playing $20 buy-in standards).

That stands as the craziest pot I've ever seen.

TL:DR. 4 people when all in with pairs only to hit Set over Set over Set on the 1st three cards on the flop... then made quads. craziest hand I've ever seen.",,False,,t5_2qhix,False,,,True,t3_18tl5y,http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/18tl5y/whats_the_craziest_live_hand_youve_eve_seen_play/,

What the hell do I do?",ohboypoker,40,13,81,http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/kpw88/a_guy_just_gave_me_16000_what_the_hell_do_i_do/,"2/5 at local casino. HUGE fish at the table. Now it's getting super late and most people are playing 1/2 and the table is slowly dying. It's up to four people including me, one of them being super tight. I am dominating the table and am up $2,000 or so already  ($3,000 in chips).

Fish at $1,200. I get QQ and end up allin vs him and another guy. I win, and the other guy leaves. It's 2AM, and the other guy is super tired and says he's skipping a round. He never comes back.

What happens next is one of the hardest ""in-your-face"" heads-up match I ever played. I managed to steal nearly $13,000 from this guy. In 2/5. It's simply unbelievable. This guy has NO idea how to play poker at all.

1) Plays 100% of his hand. Yes, even 63o. He called a $300 raise on the river with a pair of fuckin 3!

2) When he has a good hand, he always check. Check, check, check, check. When he checks the flop I pretty much know he has something, else he ""bluffs"".

On the first second hand I clean him. He instantly rebuy. Cleaned in 15 mins. He asks the dealer if he can rebuy for more than 200BB and the dealer says no, max buyin. I tell him I'm okay with it, pit boss nods, dealer agrees. Fish buys for $2,000. To his credit, he actually make his straight on the turn. He goes allin. I had nuts set. I call, I make my full on the river.

He acts like he's about to stop. It's 3:30, I am SO tired, but this guy is just spitting money, ""I'm so unlucky !!!!"". 

I say I am going to sleep, he says ""Hold on give me a chance to get it back"". Okay. We make the limit 5/10. He buys $2,500 - down to his last $100 bill. 

About 30 mins I clean him again. He plays every hand worst than the hand before. I play tight (top 30% of hands) aggressive (with the semi-bluff call with hands such as 67s which IMO are too weak to call preflop headsup)Now he cries, he says he'll be back, he withdraw some cash, and he loses it all again. I'm actually afraid to call his allin on the river with top two pair, but I win $2,000 again. Oh yeah, this guy has tons of tells too: when he pushes his chips excited, he made whatever he was hoping for. Once I flop a full on a flush draw board. I bet a bit, he calls. I bet the non-flush turn, he calls. River gives his flush. I bet a bit again, he raises, I take a long time and go allin, I win.

He's crying and he can't stop. I am dying, exhausted and want to sleep. I make a last $1,000, then two guys go behind him and say it's time to sleep. And he screams "" I lost everything! I lost it all! I was so unlucky! every hand!""

This guy just threw his money away. Called an allin on the turn with a shitty flush draw. Called with two pairs. Called with K high on a 888JT board. This guy had no idea how to play.

My question: I actually feel pretty bad about it. I mean to me it was free money. Way for a good flop, bet aggressively, he'll call with anything. This is the worst loose passive maniac fishy player ever. This is my third best poker day ever.

Is it wrong? Should I... I don't know, give some of it back? Casino made a cut from it but not that large. I mean, could I have continued even more? Where the hell does he gets that money from? I feel bad for him, imagine how you'd feel if you lost 16k. I mean, he has a problem and I feel like I took advantage of it.

He was really animated and lively at the tables, joking around with and entertaining everybody.  Harrah's shuffled him from table to table so that a lot of people would get a chance to play with him.  I railed him for a couple of hours.  Players and onlookers gravitated towards him, jumping at any opportunity to ask him for an autograph or for a picture.  At some point he goes out for a smoke, accompanied by two security guards.  When Scotty began to make his way back from the balcony, my little cousin, a huge poker junkie, starts grabbing me and begs me to ask Scotty to take a picture with us, because he was too shy to ask himself.  I'm sure Scottie was probably a little tired from being harassed for pictures and autographs all day.  I shout towards him, ""Scotty!  Can we get a picture with you!""  One of the guards started to rebuff us, but Scotty interjected, ""Sure, baby!"" with a wide smile.  There aren't words to describe how happy it made my little cousin.  
TLDR;  I met Scotty Nguyen last night and he was a really nice guy.

Below I will explain the formula used to figure out whether or not a jam is +CEV ( Positive Expected Value based on Chip Equity).

**Note:** In many situations plays will be +CEV but be -$EV and thus in actuality be bad to do.

There is a simple formula used to figure out whether or not an open jam pre-flop is +CEV or not. That formula is: **Fold Equity (FE) + Called Equity (CE) = Hand Equity (HE)** 

Fold Equity (What we gain when everyone folds) = Chips in the pot x % Everyone Folds 

Called Equity (What we gain or lose when someone calls) = ((Hero's Stack + Blinds and antes x Hand Equity vs Avg Villain Calling Range) - (Hero's Stack x Villain's Avg Hand Equity))x % Hero Gets Called

While the formula above looks pretty complex in text form, it is actually very simple and easy to apply. (Not really, but bear with me, it is worth learning/understanding)

Easiest way to explain it is to give an example from a real world hand. 

Lets say that we have [](/7s) [](/7d) UTG at a 9 handed table. We have 10k at 500-1000 + 100. If we were to shove, how many BB's +/- would our jam be?

**First thing to do is to estimate calling ranges for each person**, and then to figure out an average calling range. Generally UTG+1 will have the tightest calling range while BB will have the widest calling range. Below are some example ranges for each player. 

utg+1: 99+,AJs+,AQo+ = 5.4%

utg+2: 88+,AJs+,AQo+ = 5.9%

mp:77+,ATs+,AJo+ = 7.5%

HJ:77+,ATs+,AJo+ = 7.5%

CO: 66+,ATs+,KQs,ATo+ = 9.2%

BTN:66+,ATs+,KQs,ATo+ = 9.2%

SB :55+,A9s+,KQs,ATo+,KQo = 10.9%

BB:55+,A9s+,KQs,ATo+,KQo = 10.9%

Essentially the avg calling range generally comes out to what the cutoff or hijack will call with, thus i'd say on avg we get called by the following range: **66+,ATs+,KQs,AJo+ = 8.3%**

Now that we know what calls us on avg, we can figure out how often we get called, by mathing how often everyone folds. In order to do that, you take the % one person folds on avg and take it to the X power, where X = the number of people remaining. In the above scenario it would be 0.917 x 0.917 x 0.917 x 0.917 x 0.917 x 0.917 x 0.917 x 0.917 = .4999 (**Everyone folds on avg about 50% of the time**). 

Now that we know what range on avg is calling us, and how often everyone folds, we can figure out the FE part of the equation and start building the CE part of the equation. 

**The Fold Equity = Blinds and antes X % everyone folds, or in our scenario it is .5 x 2400.** 

**For Call Equity we first need to figure out what our hand's equity is vs the range that calls us.** We then add the blinds and antes to our stack, and multiply it by the equity. 

equity 	win 	tie 	      pots won 	pots tied	
Hand 0: 	58.638%  	57.94% 	00.70% 	     625045632 	  7508514.00   { 66+, ATs+, KQs, AJo+ }

**Hand 1: 	41.362%**  	40.67% 	00.70% 	     438688860 	  7508514.00   { 77 }

Thus the first part of the Equation for CE looks like: (12400 x 0.41)

The 2nd part of the Equation for CE is: - (10000 x 0.59)

Now the final part of the CE is we take the % everyone calls us on avg and multiply it by the number we obtained from our range Equities. (In this case we multiply it by .5 as we get folds from everyone half the time, thus at least 1 person calls us half the time).

**The CE Part of the Equation in total is**:  ((12400 x 0.41) - (10000 x 0.59)).5

**Thus the final Hand Equation is: (2400 x .50) + ((12400 x 0.41) - (10000 x 0.59)).5** 

1200 + (5084-5900).5

1200 + (-816).5

1200 - 413 = +787 chips or .79bb

This formula may seem a bit daunting at first, and a bit useless when you don't know what ranges call on average in various spots, but as you gain experience and experiment with using the equation and practice with it, you will see a noticeable increase in your ability to play with a shorter stack in tournaments. As with anything else in poker it is not an exact science and there is a lot of skill derived from being able to properly estimate calling ranges. However if you are determined enough, this equation and PokerStove is a great way to begin your journey to becoming a great short stack player (in depth understandings of ICM theory and NASH theory can come later on). 

Also it is important to note that this is just the equation for our equity when ONLY one person calls us. Occasionally we will get multiple callers when we shove, however as it occurs only a small % of the time (around 5%-10% of the time in the above scenario). Thus it affects our equity only minimally and thus we should Error on the side of nittyness when estimating our edge in shove spots to compensate for it, so in the above scenario instead of +.78bb it's actually closer to +.7bb overall.

(Note:This equation can also be used to figure out 3-bet shove math as well!)

It is much easier to explain this stuff in person/over skype, so I hope I was able to explain it all well enough.

Pick a site from here: http://www.mergegaming.com/partners.html

Any of them will be good for you as they all run the same software and all of the rooms are interconnected. Pick one at random! The only difference is the user interface, but they should all be very similar.

### Freerolls

Freerolls occur at 0:00 EST (Midnight), 6:00 EST (6 AM), and 20:00 EST (8 PM). You can simply sign up for these. Maximum 5,000 players and no late entry so try to sign up early, up to 4 hours. They pay CASH to the top 4 ($18, $14, $9, $5) as well as satellites to other tourneys (SNG/MTTs) for quite a few spots.

### Steps

In the client you'll find a ""Player Admin"" button, where you'll see a list of buttons on the left side. If you find the right button, which should be labeled ""Play Money"" or something similar, you can exchange 250 play money chips for a Step 1 entry ticket.

* Top 3 in Step 1 get a Step 2 ticket
* Top 2 in Step 2 get a Step 3 ticket (3rd place gets another Step 2 ticket)
* Top 1 in Step 3 wins $1.00 cash (2nd gets a Step 3 and 3rd gets a Step 2 entry)

Then you can enter either a $0.10+$0.01 6-seat SNG or a $0.50+$0.10 10-seat SNG to try to earn money that way.

NOTE: You can get a max of 10 free Step 1 tickets per day. The average player will make ~95 Step 1 attempts before cashing $1. So this method is pretty terrible, but still possible. I cashed on my 36th attempt. (But I was mostly 4- or 6-tabling the Step 1s)

At the tables to the side of the room was a middle aged woman also with her nose in a book, but she didn't look like she was enjoying herself. Eventually a man walks over to her and they start arguing. They aren't being loud or making a scene, but I'm the table next to them so I can't help but overhear.

I did my best not to listen in, but I still caught things like, ""You were up when I wanted to leave!"" and, ""How could you have lost so much?"" After a minute or two of this they stand to leave the card room together. They make it about twenty feet when the table he was sitting at yells loudly with one voice clearly saying ,""That's a bad beat!""

Everyone gets up from their games to come look and sure enough quad tens just lost to a straight flush 7 to the jack. All the hole cards played and the table was thrilled to be splitting the bad beat jackpot which was sitting at $98,000. 

Lo and behold the man who was arguing with his wife had been in the hand at the start, but had picked up what was left of his stack after he folded preflop. If he hadn't argued with his wife he would have been long gone by the time the hand actually reached its conclusion. The table share for him was roughly $3,500 and both left arm in arm with the fight completely forgotten.

They are 2/5 and above only and are really juicy. The main drawback is the dealing is terrible, and the bosses are completely clueless. I could give some examples, but they are mostly pretty standard. They just occur at maybe 10x the frequency of a normal room. 

Anyway, here is the hand. Villain is OTB and is loose splashy rec. He just lost last hand leaving him about $100. Hero covers (obv).

I open UTG to $20 with TT. Get 4 callers. Flop A35r. I check, checks through. turn 8c, puts 2 clubs on board. I check. Checks to villain, but shoves his remain $69. Hes not repping much here, as I think he never checks A OTB. Quick look to my left, no one calling. I call. River is 2c. 

Villain is acting like he is going to muck, but doesn't. I don't like to flip my hand right away so maybe I can see his. Dealer finally says 
""show me a winner"", so I show. Now all of a sudden player reveals 2 100 chip runner tokens that were under his players card, and bets $100 (this is an error on my part, I did not notice him interacting with the runner).

I actively wanted to ""invest"" in bitcoin last weekend for entertainment/speculation, but despite spending a few hours trying to get bitcoins I could not find a method that satisfied my sketchiness/absorbitant fees criteria. This leads me to believe that this post could be useful in helping those who are interested but are overwhelmed by the process.

Without further ado, here's the way that I found easiest:


1) Go to https://bitfloor.com/ and create an account

2) Click on the 'Deposit' tab, check the boxes, enter an amount in USD and 'Request Deposit Amount'

3) Go to your local Bank of America with the instructions found on the next page. All you need is the cash and the account number from the instructions page (the teller filled out the out-of-state deposit slip for me). Double check that you are sending the exact amount correctly: this is how they verify you! LocalTill generates a random $ amount that is ~1% higher than your deposit amount as a form of ID on your account. 

4) The deposit should show up in USD on your bitfloor account very quickly, mine took about 10-15 minutes.

5) Click on the 'Trade' tab in bitfloor. Depending on how impatient you are, a 'Market Order' allows you to simply use your balance to purchase bitcoins at the market (""ask"") value, or you can place limit orders to try and get them a bit cheaper. Market orders fill almost instantly, limit orders may take longer (I had one go through in about 10 minutes and am currently waiting on another one).

6) Once you have a balance of bitcoins on your bitfloor account, you can ""withdraw"" them to your wallet. If you don't have a wallet, simply go to: https://blockchain.info/wallet/new and create an account. This will give you a wallet ID which you can withdraw to. Send your funds from bitfloor to this account.

7) Now that you have bitcoins in your BlockChain wallet, you can send them to sealwithclubs. Log in to your seals account and go to https://sealswithclubs.eu/my-account/ . You should see a wallet ID under ""Current Cash In Address"". Paste this ID into the 'Send Money' tab in BlockChain with the amount you wish to deposit.

8) The transaction will be verified automatically (5-30 minutes), chips will appear in your seals account, and you are ready to play poker!


As for the actual poker experience itself: I'll just confirm some opinions that others have said around here. The play is very soft (I found whales willing to call my all-in with any two preflop), at least at the micros. There were about 300 players logged in while I was playing (Friday night EST). Since it is flash/browser-based, there are very limited options as far as HUDs, etc, though a few basic stats are automatically tracked in text form (hand histories, flops seen, stuff like that).

As far as cashing out: I haven't tried it myself yet, but I have heard others confirm that it is extremely easy and quick. Once you are familiar with the bitcoin environment and have your own wallet with funds in it, transferring them around is the easy part.

So, from one cherry-broken noob who made far too many *really* embarrassing mistakes to the next:

* That oval line in the middle of the table? All your bets go *past* it (on the inside), not just in front of you or your stack (DUH).

* That 'big blind' chip they put in front of empty seats when the button moves isn't like the 'dealer' chip / button we're all so used to in friendly cash games. It doesn't move with the button -- it stays where the dealer put it for a reason (so the person at the empty chair can ""buy the button"" to re-join when they return to the table). No, really, don't try to move it out of courtesy when the dealer button moves. :/

* The chip tray doesn't go on your lap, or under the table, etc -- it slides right behind the base of the backrest of your chair.

* When someone asks if you want to play 1/2/**4**, it means the usual $1 / $2 blinds with a third blind of $4 to raise the stakes a bit. Don't just nod and say ""uhhh, sure"" like I did, and then sit there like an idiot in the BB+1 spot with no chips in front of you.

* You can tip the drink people in chips (I kind knew this, but apparently I was noobiful-looking enough that the person next to me felt he had to let me know when I choose to tip a dollar bill instead of a chip).

Anything else I'm missing?

I'd say it's probably a leak in my game right now.  I tend to flat a raise in position with AK so as to not drive out worse aces, and 3-bet out of position so I have initiative postflop.  But I have no clue how to react to a 4-bet with AK preflop.  At the stakes I'm playing at (4NL) I feel like a 4 bet range for the regs consists almost entirely of AA, KK and maybe AK, which means I ought to be folding to this range.  Do people stack off at 6 max with JJ/QQ/AQ often enough that I can ever get it in preflop with AK?  I see a lot of people advocate for getting it in with AK preflop but I feel like against the range of hands that stacks off preflop, AK is in pretty rough shape.

I'm also not too sure how to deal with somebody 3-betting me when I hold AK out of position.  By 4-betting I'm turning AK into a bluff, I think, because no hand ever calls a 4-bet that I beat.  QQ is basically the only hand I have equity against, and I'm screwed on any board with cards lower than Q, and on any board with an A or K on it QQ will give up quickly.  And if they 5-bet shove preflop, can I REALLY call them?  It feels pretty gross.

So, what's the deal with AK preflop guys?",,False,,t5_2qhix,False,,,True,t3_w2p79,http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/w2p79/lets_talk_about_playing_ak_preflop/,

**some general rules**


1. if you don't want to say anything when you raise, make sure you use more than 1 chip. if you want to raise to 25 dollars, if you throw in 1 green chip it will be considered a call of the initial bet/raise.

2. don't string bet - if you say ""bet/raise"" but don't say the actual amount, and want to bet/raise 40 and you neatly make two stacks of red chips and you use one hand and put in one stack at a time, the dealer will say ""bet/raise 20"" as opposed to 40. if you want to bet/raise without saying the amount of it, you have to push in the chips in one single motion into the middle of the table.

3. you can sit down with more than the maximum buy-in if you're previous table breaks off (i.e.so they can create a full table by consolidating 2 small tables). if you're playing 1/2, max buy-in is 300, you can sit down with 800 if you want if you had that much from your previous table.

4. make sure your cards are behind the line, if even a little piece is touching or crosses the line on the table, it can be questioned as a fold. obviously for your chips as well when calling or bet/raising.

5. if someone calls you, you are more inclined to show first because someone is calling YOUR bet/raise. you'll see that people don't want to show even when they are called (esp. if they were bluffing) and tell you to show first. but you can make the argument that you called them. the dealer will say the same thing. 

**my personal tips &amp; observations**

1. general rule of thumb - 1/2NL online is different from live. in 1/2 online you'll see people folding 10's to an 8 dollar pre-flop raise. in live even tight aggressive people will call 12 with pocket 10s. 

- the standard live raise i see with ""raise-able"" hands is 10-16 bucks pre-flop. when i see raises of 6 to 8, i immediately think they are tourists or online players and are new to live casino games.

2. if you are a great online player and you immerse yourself in countless books and poker theory, you don't have to show it off by using all this poker-specific lingo like ""fold equity"" or ""value."" i know you're trying to sound smart but to me, you sound like an idiot trying to show off your poker knowledge. i think a great player understands all those things but don't say a word about it. it ultimately gives ""sharks"" a perfect categorization and use this knowledge to play back at you.

3. some stereotypes of players:

- old men: they are solid tight, conservative players. they won't bluff a lot but are good enough to call a bluff. they have a good understanding of the game but have no balls to bluff themselves. please note, what i'm trying to say don't try to bluff an old guy unless your bluff is perfect and believable. 

- young scruffy guys with bad hygiene, wear sandals, need haircuts, wear hoodies and cargo shorts: usually the live grinders, though i have no understanding of how they grind at 1/2 and make a consistent living.

- guys wearing sunglasses - usually they aren't that good and just want to look good.

- asian/middle eastern guys - i can't exactly say they all have good poker knowledge but they tend to be aggressive with their hands, look for the bluffs, but watch out, they can trap and actually have a solid hand. just be alert or don't get in a hand with them with regular-strength cards or you'll get outplayed.

4.  don't berate a noob player. you don't have to say ""great hand"" or anything either. just don't call him out. there's plenty of times when i see these ""good"" players that rip noobs a new asshole and later find that they are in a hand with a noob and are stuck more than half their stack in the pot. the good player goes all in and the noob calls, and wins and the good player just gets mad and leaves. save face, just sit quiet towards a noob and his bad playing/calling abilities.

5. you don't have to get into a hand with a better player if your hand isn't good. its very mentally draining to think of all the lines and scenarios and making the right moves when you are playing against a good player. i will fold JQ pre-flop vs an aggressive player but will raise or reraise against a noob and try to outplay him. at the end of the day, poker is fun but you also want to make money. so have fun and play smart. don't play KJ and by the turn all you're doing is calling every street with a J high board. you're gonna end up doubling up or losing everything. you wanna risk everything on one hand like that? wait it out.

Let's just say this was play money because of obvious reasons.  

At a guy's house, game was 1/2, I bought in for 200.  I was having a pretty terrible run at the start, and was down to about 43, during this time I was side-betting the dealer 5, whether the flop would be black or red.  I end up side betting 5 and going all in with the remaining 38.  Lost the all in but won the side bet, so I was sitting with 10.  I pushed next hand, everyone at the table called me, I ended up winning the hand with I think it was 2 pair, with Q 10 or something like that.  So I was sitting around 80-90.  Next hand picked up QQ, UTG raises to 18, another player calls, I repop it all in, Both call.  I was against AK and JJ, my hand held up.  I'm now sitting around 250-280.  I grind it out for a couple of ours then finally pick up KK, I'm sitting around 300 at the time. I raise on the button, Big blind re raises me, I push, he calls, shows QQ, I hold up.  So now I'm sitting at around 600, and there's only about 4 people left, we decide to play it out for a little bit.  About 30 minutes later, I pick up KQ Spades, Raise on the button, 2 players call.  Flop comes 10spades Jspades, blank.  First position bets around 40, next player raises to around 120.. Now I was a bit drunk, and felt like I couldn't miss, so I shoved over the top all in.  BOTH players call, and show Trip 10s and trip jacks.  Turn blanks, River 4 of spades, I flush up, pull in around a 1600 pot.  Table breaks up, throw the dealer 100 and take off a happy man.

I have never used BitCoin before (after reading up on it though I am definitely intrigued), and I didn't want to spend any real money (at least not yet).

So instead of going the route of buying BitCoins I set up a miner on my ATI 7950 and let it run for ~2 days until I had .15 BTC (~$1.95 US).  I then transfered that to my BitCoin Wallet.  Side note. The BitCoin client app that stores your wallet takes a LONG time to sync.  It's downloading a ~3GB file that contains all BitCoin transactions EVER.  I have a 50MBs connection and it took about 24 hours to catch up which is terrible and I sent them a bug report.  I was able to mine in the mean time using a separate app that I got from the BTCGuild.com mining pool.  So as previously stated it took about two days to get to the point were I could actually make a deposit.

The card room I picked was SealsWithClubs.eu and they had my transfer almost instantly.  That said it took a bit of poking around to make sure I did send the transfer to the right place.  It's very obvious that this is a small scale room.  That said I was able to quickly sit down at a table and start playing.

Software wise the room is very basic.  I don't currently have HEM or PT installed but since the room is flash based in side of your browser I doubt the HUDS will work.  There is a way to view your hand history for the table your at but I didn't see a way to save HH locally so I don't know that you can even add the data to your program of choice.  On top of that I tried copying and pasting a hand history to weaktight.com and handconverter.com neither of which could read the hand.  So for serious play right now it's kind of a bust.

That said I did almost quadruple my funds in about 2.5 hours so that's not bad.  All in all it did scratch my poker itch.  While the software leaves a lot to be desired I think I will keep playing and encourage others to do so with the hope that it will encourage other rooms to start taking US players with BitCoins.",,False,,t5_2qhix,False,,,True,t3_1672d1,http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/1672d1/first_impression_of_bitcoin_poker_from_a_usa/,

This last weekend I was playing $3/$6 limit HE (w/ a kill if the pot goes above $60 dollars... is this unique to my home casino?) at my local casino.  The table composition was pretty awesome with a perfect mix of tourists and ""regulars"".  I am 22 years old and the other regular was maybe 25-26 years old (both of us full time college students making a little easy fun money on the side).  The tourists were all 50+ years old. Most were ""elderly"" gentlemen with the oldest being an estimated 80 years old.  These fellas were the guys with near infinite bank rolls playing the ""old school"" gamblers game.  It was clear they were there for fun and let the cards play.  All in all they were giving away money because it was raise raise raise with top pair into straights, flushes, and trip ripe boards.

-The Story-

This one older gentlemen (call him Blue Shirt) left the table to attend to something.  He may have gone to eat, use the bathroom, drink, etc.  I didn't pay attention to it, but he was gone for roughly an hour.  Blue Shirt was a guy with an endless bankroll and there for fun, he was giving away money to me and the other regular.  He was not a very good player but he knew enough to get into troubles.  

So Blue Shirt is gone for a looooong time.  While Blue Shirt is gone the evening tournament breaks so a waiting list develops for another $3/$6 game.  The house opens another $3/$6 table right next to ours because of this.  So we have two full $3/$6 games right next to each other.  The clientele for both games is roughly the same with two young guys and the rest older men (and one middle age woman at the other table).

Time goes on....

Next thing you know the poker silence (lol) is disturbed by an older Asian guy yelling ""WHO ARE YOU!?""  He has a seat, the exact seat as Blue Shirt, at the $3/$6 table right next to ours, apparently he got his seat played a few rounds and then left for dinner or something.  He had just returned...  With the commotion  everyone from our table (with Blue Shirt still gone) looks over to see what was going on.  

I SHIT YOU NOT

BLUE SHIRT WAS PLAYING THE ASIAN GUYS STACK AT THE OTHER $3/$6 TABLE!!!!  EVERYONE AT OUR TABLE HAD A LOOK LIKE ""WHAT?""

Apparently Blue Shirt had come back after his long absence and mistakenly sat at the other $3/$6 table and began playing someones stack.  All unknown to the dealer and everyone else at the table.  I suppose its logical to consider that on a weekend, with a new table, deals close to shift end, and the fact that $3/$6 is in many ways the new comers game, it is possible for this situation to happen.  

Floor was called and that table froze in a strong WTF moment.  

But it gets better....

Blue Shirt had been literally giving away money to our table.  He was down at least $600 since I had sat down (I had him for at least $200).  Apparently, Blue Shirt had got on a little heater at this table and build the old Asian Guys stack up.  

So we have:

Blue Shirt playing someone elses stack.  
He made money on this stack.  

Situation:

How is this situation solved in your home casinos?  Have you ever witnessed such a thing?


Solution at my place:  Luckily these two guys were very kind with regards to the situation.  Blue Shirt was clearly embarrassed and had honestly become disoriented with what table he was playing at.  I had my back to the poker room entrance so there was no way that I could have seen him walk over to the other table.  The Asian Guy was mixed emotion about it.  He was laughing and then at the same time saying ""how much does he owe me"" (lol).  Little did he know that Blue Shirt made him some cash.  It turns out that he made around $200 bucks thanks too a could of huge kill pots. 


The Asian Guy decides that its only fair that they split the profit and continue on with the night.  I figure that I would have come to the same conclusion if I was in the same situation.

The best part of the matter was the kindness exhibited during the ordeal.  It was clear that these two guys understood the ""old man"" nature to do such a thing.  The funniest thing of the whole ideal is that the Asian guy called Blue Shirt ""Old Man"" for the rest of the night.  

Has anyone ever seen this?

I thought I would do my part to increase the quality of this subreddit by writing a few posts about tournament poker. I can't promise that I will make a lot of these or that they will come very often.

This first post is very basic tournament strategy, so if you already know this bear with me.

----

**The value of tournament chips**

Knowing the value of the chips you have, risk and stand to win is crucial to any form of poker. In cash games this is made easy by the fact that you are playing with actual money. One dollar is one dollar.

This is most definitely not the case for tournaments. Let's understand why:

You are sitting down in a 10 man Sit and Go. It costs $10 to enter and everyone gets 1000 chips. So 1,000 chips is worth $10. Like most 10 man SNGs this one pays 50% for first, which is $50. To get first place you need to win all of the chips. So 10,000 chips is worth $50. From start to finish the value of an average chip is cut in half.

Imagine now that you are in the same SNG, but 4-handed with only 500 chips. The chip leader has 8,500 chips and the two last players each have 500. Let's also assume that the chip leader is secured first place. He isn't, but for the sake of this example we are going to assume he is. So that leaves $50 to be distributed among you and the other two short stacks. This means your 500 chips is now worth $16.67. That's almost 70% more than 1,000 chips was worth when the tournament started.

As you can see from the example, the value of your chips change throughout the tournament. In fact, not even all your chips are worth the same. Your first chip is worth more than your last chip.

To illustrate this I tell people to imagine your stack as one huge stack of 1-chips. Whenever you bet or call you take chips from the top of the stack. Whenever you win chips you put them back on the top. If you have a 1,000 chip stack, losing 10 off of the top doesn't affect your chances to win by much, but if you were to lose only one chip off of a stack of 2 chips, that would cut your chances to win in half.

It is theoretically possible to get 2nd place in a tournament with only one chip, so the value of your last chip is extremely high.

*The chips you put on the top of your stack are worth less than the same chips on the bottom of your stack.*

**How does this affect how you play?**

It affects your strategy a lot because this means that the chips you risk are worth more than the chips you stand to win. If someone went directly all-in preflop and showed you their hand. You are exactly 51% to win against him, should you call for your entire stack? It depends, but most likely not. Because the chips you are risking are worth a lot more than one chips you can potentially win. There would have to be a lot of dead money in the pot to justify that call.

To put it simple this means call less and raise more compared to cash games.

Understanding how the value of your chips change throughout the tournament is absolutely crucial to being a good tournament player.

There are various ways of calculating (by that I mean approximating) the actual dollar value of your tournament stack. The post popular method is ICM, but this only works for smaller tournaments or when there are few players left.

I suggest you read up a bit about ICM (Independent Chip Model) and try a calculator to see how the values change with your stack. This will allow you to get a better feel for it.",,False,,t5_2qhix,1346442800.0,,,True,t3_z4ub1,http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/z4ub1/tournament_strategy_chapter_1/,
1341850608.0,24,self.poker,w9xs6,"GG all, I'm done playing.",JimmyJamesincorp,54,30,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/w9xs6/gg_all_im_done_playing/,"Last saturday night I hit rock bottom. I never felt this could happen to me, it certainly wasn't pretty, here's the story:

Some context: I'm a 30 year old architect who had an accident driving drunk 7 years ago, I'm now a paraplegic. I started playing poker about 3 years ago and got instantly hooked.

I went to my local underground room after one of my best friend's wedding. I wanted to give him a bass guitar as a wedding gift (which is a stupid idea, he does well, I'm broke) Anyway I went to play drunk and as LAG as I ever did, I started ok but it didn't end well. I lost about $1k. So when I had to pay I realized I had no actual way to do it but to transfer some Stars dollars I had. I check my account and it says I have $228, and because it wasn't enough I decided to flip them on a turbo HUSNG. My JJ got beat by a straight right away in an all in pre. Deposited $500 more and tried to flip again, same story, my 99 this time was beat by A7. One more time I said, this time $1k, 1 match, double or nothing. I get the money in the A23 flop holding A3, villain payed with AQ and rivered 2 pair. I felt like puking, as I was now $2,728 down in a matter of minutes. I promised the room cashier I'll pay with a guitar that's worth about $1k and I left. 

I came home and started crying. I know this is not that much money, but it wasn't about that, it was the fact that I finally found out I'm a drunk degen and poker has not been a positive influence to me. I'm a good player, I can grind some cash up only to get wasted and lose it all, it has happened many times. 

Anyway, I've been quite depressed lately and was actually thinking about killing myself. Instead of doing that I decided to call my good friend/half time boss to help me. I told him all about it, and we came o the conclusion that I need to clean up my act. Too much alcohol, cigarettes, gambling and other drugs are taking the best of me, so that was it, I'm done I said. He was kind enough to front me some cash to get out of the financial hole I'm in right now. 

I feel now liberated and I like the fact that now there's no way but up. I'm quite a talented 3d artist and architect, I'm also a musician and I like to paint. I left all those things because of poker, I think it's because of my self destructive nature., gambling and drugs have been my refuge since my accident, and I just figured I deserve better. So here I come sobriety, wish me luck :)

What I learned playing poker:

- You can be as talented as Ivey, but that's just useless If you are not disciplined and put the hard work behind it.

- Chances are that you are not nearly as good as you think, stop lying to yourself and to everyone else.

- Money don't mean shit to me. I'm glad to have this at least.

- Poker players are generally not interesting people. I'd rather have my old friends back.

- I'm talented but useless. I can exploit the passive fish and piss of regulars so that they make bad decisions against me. It's awesome and I love it, but it's useless. I simply don't have the right mindset to be a successful poker player. I can do good, but eventually I'll fuck it up good. Also, I don't think I'm able to exercise a healthy BRM.

So that's it man. This is probably my last r/poker thread, GG, GL all and thanks for all the time you put on helping me when I needed to learn.

One last thing; I won't be going to any Anonymous group to deal with my addictions, I wanna do this by myself, it would be too depressing to hear about ""Jesus"". I'd rather flip my whole bank credit than becoming one of those guys.

1321954081.0,25,self.poker,mlaxu,How to post hand histories to /poker for analysis,,32,7,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/mlaxu/how_to_post_hand_histories_to_poker_for_analysis/,"Hey everyone. Lately I've noticed a bit of a problem with regards to hand histories. People regularly post them incorrectly, which makes it difficult for us to analyse them and in some cases has led to people spending a lot of time analysing a hand only to have their analysis voided when OP adds some extra information to the hand.

For those of you that don't know, posting hands for analysis by other players is a fantastic way to learn more about poker, and there are lots of great poker players here who are happy to help.

So, here's what is generally accepted as the best way to post a hand (the example thread is pasted below under **GOOD HAND EXAMPLE**). Notice how OP (oh, it's me? How embarrassing!) has included all of the relevant stats, such as how he's perceived, how his opponent is playing (VPIP/PFR are vital stats in any hand, but if you're not using a HUD, general observations such as ""he's very aggressive"" will do), and then any further stats that may be useful (flop c-bet).

Additionally, general information about the circumstances of the hand is given: whether it's online/live, the size of the field and the buy-in, the strength of the players, the stakes and the current stage of the tournament are all useful to know, depending on whether you're playing a cash game or tournament.

OP has then discussed why he is confused, giving his reasoning along the way. This information should always be included above the hand history, so as to not clutter the hand itself.

Finally, OP finishes by including the hand, in a properly-formatted fashion by simply copying and pasting the hand into the [Reddit Hand Converter](http://www.handconverter.com/), or if it's a live hand, presenting it in the style of the hand converter. I don't know if there's a way to include spoilers on /poker, but generally it's best to post the hand outcome maybe 12 hours later. Or, post the result as a comment, so that people on the front page can expand the text to read about the hand, and then enter the thread to see the results.

**GOOD HAND EXAMPLE** ([source](http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/mlgn7/550_mtt_jj_facing_a_khigh_flop/))

&gt; CO is running at 17/8 over 70 hands, but has been quick to call some shoves with ATo etc, and once limped UTG, leading me to believe that he's not fantastic. He's c-bet the flop on 3 out of 3 occasions.

&gt; I'm playing ABC TAG poker, running at about 18/12.

&gt; We're both fairly deep, chip average for the tournament at this point is 20,000, and it's a Sunday, so the field is both large and weak, meaning that I'm apprehensive to get it all-in pre here, because I think that I can use my skill edge well instead of relying on coinflips, and we're approaching the bubble, so I don't want to bust over something so marginal.

&gt; I put him on a fairly decent range due to the limper, but we can't be sure of his strength exactly, so let's say 66+, AQ+. I expect him to c-bet the dry flop here with ATC, but his 1/2 pot bet seems to suggest that he's not strong - at these stakes I notice a lot of 2/3rds+pot bets with strength.

&gt; When he checks the turn, I figure he doesn't have a K, so I'm just wondering how I can get him to maybe fold QQ or call with a lower pair, without betting too much to lose lots of money if he does actually has a K. Afterwards, he commented ""I knew you didn't have a K"", which is weird considering how I believe I took the exact line that anyone would have taken with a K.

**BAD HAND EXAMPLE** ([source](http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/mb2qw/poker_hand/))

&gt;I had AKo on the button. One raise to 3bb, then another guy reraises it to 5 times the other guys raise. The guy who reraised was supertight 16vp pfr 14. Only saw him with huge pairs really, he may also had AK, i don't know.

&gt;I just call, and he bets huge on the flop 10d6cQd. I fold, thoughts please?


As well as the poor formatting, questions that OP leaves unanswered include:

* Is this a cash game or a tournament,
* Is it live or online,
* Are your opponents good players,
* How many people are at the table,
* What are the stakes/buyin,
* If it's a tournament is it near a bubble,
* What's everyone's position,
* What does the original raiser do in response to the 3-bet,
* Who bets huge on the flop,
* Did you have to check to let him bet huge on the flop,
* What was his bet size,
* Did you have a diamond in your hand,
* How many hands did you have on the villain?

And can you then see how hard it was for everyone to analyse his hand? Most people didn't even try.

1264269765.0,24,self.poker,atb92,"Judging by many of the posts in /r/poker, lots of redditors don't really understand variance. Here's a variance simulator, and a couple of examples.",dO_ob,27,3,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/atb92/judging_by_many_of_the_posts_in_rpoker_lots_of/,"In simple (non-rigorous) terms, variance is the fluctuation of a variable from its expected value. In poker, it's most often used to describe the uncontrollable fluctuation of a player's actual winrate over a certain hand sample from its expected value.
   
As a result of variance, if you've played less than, say, fifty thousand hands of cash game NLH, you have **no idea** what your true winrate as a player is. Variance is a **huge** factor in a sample as small as fifty thousand hands.
  
By way of example, here's a [variance simulator](http://www.pokervariancesimulator.fr/). You enter your winrate in $ per 100 hands, and the standard deviation of your winrate in $ per 100 hands, and it will chart the progress of a number of virtual players with your winrate and SD. You enter a number of hands to perform these trials over, and a number of virtual players to model, and it outputs a graph.
   
For example, [here's a chart using my long-term stats from 50NL, over a 30k hand simulation](http://imgur.com/RXhkz.png) (the number of hands a casual grinder might play in a month). The graph models fifty players, all with the same true long-term winrate, all playing as well as each other, and all with the same expected level of variance. The luckiest five players make **almost six and a half times** what the unluckiest five players make.
 
If we adjust the graph for [5k hands](http://imgur.com/WXXNi.png) (the number of hands a recreational player might play in a month), now the bottom 20% of these **winning** players are **losing** money. The unluckiest fellow down at the bottom of the graph seems to have lost seven or eight BIs. 
  
The purpose of this post is to encourage novice players to **not indulge in results orientated thinking**. In that last graph, **all of the players are long-term winners**, but that poor guy at the bottom is probably thinking to himself that's he's terrible, and should give up now, because he's played all month and lost a fair bit of cash. If we narrow a simulation down further, to the few hundred hands a recreational player might play in a day, we can draw almost **no conclusion** about that player's actual winrate from the amount of money they win or lose, because variance is **by far** the overriding influence.
 
You need a large hand sample before you can start trying to establish your long-term winrate. There is a still a lot of variance for most players over 50k hands, you might be able to draw more valid conclusions over a couple of hundred thousand hands. If we look at our [50NL grinder over 350k hands](http://imgur.com/f27dx.png) (the number of hands a casual grinder might play in a year), we see that although there is a much greater apparent convergence in the graph, the luckiest 10% are still earning 40% more than the unluckiest 10%.
 
If you'd like to try [experimenting with your own variance and winrate](http://www.pokervariancesimulator.fr/), you can get these data from player summary report in PT3 (you have to configure it to display SD in $/100).",,False,,t5_2qhix,True,,,True,t3_atb92,http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/atb92/judging_by_many_of_the_posts_in_rpoker_lots_of/,

Villain is playing lots of hands, and winning a lot. I'm relatively new to the table and he's been in a lot of them and is being selectively super aggressive. I've seen him lose a stack and rebuy and then get stack to over 550 in 30 minutes. Mid 30's hat low. I think he's decent player and not just a donk on a hot streak even if a bit loose, because he probably plays all live.

Hero plays LAG and has a 300bb stack after playing in a few hands with villain and folding without showdown to his aggressiveness.

Anyone have any good stories?,ctoph13,31,5,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/x7bhv/no_interesting_new_posts_today_anyone_have_any/,"Pretty bored today, nothing new on here to discuss. I figured if anyone has any funny/embarrassing/cool/whatever stories they could share them since myself and probably the other people who degen in this subreddit are bored. I'll start with one.

Friends and I get together every couple weeks and play in my basement. We call it Robertson's Den the Big Game (My last name isn't actually Robertson but you get the point) for no other reason that just because. It's usually a 1/2 game split between NLHE and PLO, but as it gets later and we drink more it becomes random games every orbit. So one orbit we're playing blind mans bluff. If you're not familiar with blind mans bluff, it's NLHE except you take your two cards and hold them to your forehead facing outwards. Everyone gets to see your cards but you, and you get to see everyone's cards but your own. This game gets out of control pretty fast I can tell you.

So I'm on the button and we're 5 handed. UTG raises to $7, CO calls, I call, SB calls, BB checks. UTG is holding [T](/hearts)[7](/hearts), CO has napkins, SB has napkins, and BB has [3](/hearts)[3](/spades). I'm assuming by all the loose action my hand isn't godlike.

FLOP ($35): [A](/hearts)[Q](/hearts)[2](/spades). Everyone looks at the flop and then looks at everyone elses hand. I notice CO looking at my hand and having a sort of ""wow"" look, wasn't sure at the time if it was an angle or not. SB checks, BB checks, UTG checks, CO checks, going on my drunken read I bet $20. SB folds, BB raises to $50, UTG calls, CO calls, I'm getting priced in so I call.

TURN ($235): [2](/hearts)
		
At this point I'm thinking I was pretty strong on the flop. Normally when we play this we try to raise each other to make each other fold the winner. It's happened a lot which leads to a looser game most of the time and everyone calling. I'm drunkenly trying to put together information. UTG raised preflop, so obviously I don't have any sort of AA QQ AQ monster hand. I could have something like A2 or Q2 because CO looked at me funny on the flop. BB raised me on the flop so I'm thinking I've got to have like Q2 or A2, both which are boats now. UTG made his flush but he doesn't know it. If I have a strong hand here and I play aggressive everyones obviously folding. BB bets $75, UTG and CO both fold, and I'm almost sure I have a good hand now and he's trying to get me to fold. I call.
				
RIVER ($385) [T](/clubs) 
		
CO is pretty pumped that we're getting a big pot going. He keeps looking at my hand an the board. Obviously I've got some dirt Q2 and I'm huge. Sickest soul read ever while being half in the bag. BB thinks long and hard while looking at my hand. He's trying to think if he can get me off it. Finally he goes all in for about $150. **SNAP CALL** I flip over my hand and say ""good try bro."" and look down at:
		
[8](/clubs)[4](/spades).

I'm talking about those of you who are just interested in poker, or who are relative beginners at poker, or even who are winning players at microstakes, but who want to become winning players at the $0.25/$0.50 No Limit Hold'em level online, or $2/$5 No Limit Hold'em live.

I'm *not* going to train you. I have written some poker training software. My offer is that I will mentor you, and offer you the use of my poker training software, as we both work to turn you into a solid winning poker player. This may take some time, and it will definitely take some effort, on your part and mine.

Firstly, here are my credentials...

----

**anonymous7 = RangeVsRange = guyupstairs**

Until now, I have been anonymous (and I have tried not to let that anonymity turn me into a jerk). I started this account in 2009 because my previous account (2007) was personally identifiable, and I wanted to be a bit freer to speak my mind. I was one of the founding moderators of this reddit (see [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/a6nwq/changes_to_rpoker/)), and I've been the most active moderator since. [ibarg](http://www.reddit.com/user/ibarg) is the other active moderator of this reddit, and he deserves great credit for being the guy who got up and usurped steveoola, who created this reddit and promptly got lost.

**guyupstairs**

My screenname on Full Tilt was guyupstairs. Full Tilt was the site I played most on. Here is what PokerTableRatings has for the three stakes I've played most (ring games):

    Stake            Hands    Net     BB/100
    $0.05/$0.1 NLH   17,479   $200    5.72
    $1/$2 NLH        15,839   $4,019  6.34
    $0.01/$0.02 NLH  14,510   $49     8.52

Note how long I spent at 1c/2c, even though my winrate was so high. This is because I deposited $10 on Full Tilt, and followed strict bankroll management. You will also follow strict bankroll management, but there will be more on that later. I actually got to the point that I was properly bankrolled to play $400 NL (i.e. $2/$4), but I recognised that my bankroll had finally overtaken my ability, so I didn't take a shot.

My lifetime bankroll is over $9,000 :), including live play.

Here are my OfficialPokerRankings results (multi-table tournaments):

    Prizes   Profit   ROI   ABI     AFS   ITM
    $3,996   $1,254   46%   $5.62   229   90/488

And SharkScope (includes sit'n'gos):

    Games Played   Av. Profit   Av. Stake   Av. ROI   Total Profit
    1,168          $1           $5          41%       $1,579

**Range vs. Range**

The software I have written is called Range vs. Range. Until now I have been posting about it as user [RangeVsRange](/user/rangevsrange), anonymously. This is because I did not want to be seen to be abusing my position as a moderator of this reddit. However, very few people seem to understand how this software works, and I accept some responsibility for that. Mostly I think the problem is that people who understand poker theory haven't noticed it yet. Probably because they're too busy winning money, and spending their spare poker time doing what they've always done to try to improve their poker game: watching videos, getting coaching, reading books and discussing hands.

For an explanation of why I don't think videos, coaching, books and hand discussion are sufficient or efficient, see [here](http://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/15/poker-theory/how-we-improve-poker-1175422/) on Two Plus Two.

For the post where I explained what this software was about, see [here](http://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/45/software/new-software-range-vs-range-1171917/) on Two Plus Two, or the reddit I created for it, /r/rangevsrange.

----

**The offer**

I'm going to close the Range vs. Range software and make it invitation-only. I will offer accounts to all who wish to take me up on this offer, including non-redditors, but /r/poker and /r/rangevsrange is where we will discuss things, so you'll have to be a redditor to participate. (Later, I might make the offer available to the Two Plus Two micro stakes forum. Depending on how this goes.)

I will set up a training programme in the Range vs. Range software.

I want to make it very clear here that my software is actually aimed at mid-stakes players and above, but I'm going to make it useful for beginners too. The way I will do this is by creating training situations that are the most common in microstakes games. For example, 3bets are something small stakes players have to be good at, but that's less true at microstakes because people don't make thin 3bets very often. You also will not particularly have to think about ranges, because the ranges will be near-optimal. This means that the cards your opponent will have when playing on Range vs. Range will be the cards they would have if they were a strong player. The one caveat to the usefulness of this software is that it trains you to play against good players, and while microstakes has some good players, it also has many weak players. That's something we'll have to discuss in time.

So, the training programme: I will come up with a progression of training situations, starting with the ones that are most important for you to be good at – and be comfortable with (this is also very important). As you work on the first situation, you will become comfortable with and it you will come to know your own strategy for this situation very well. This will make it very easy to play when this situation comes up at the poker table, and because you know exactly what your default strategy is, you will also find it much easier to make *slight* adjustments to this strategy based on what you know about your opponent. Much more on this later.

Here are the situations we will start with. I haven't thought much about these, and I will continue to refine them from now until the challenge starts, and beyond:

* Middle position player raises to 3 big blinds, button calls, everyone else folds.
* Late position player raises to 3 big blinds, big blind calls, everyone else folds.
* Middle position player raises to 3 big blinds, button calls, big blind calls.

Once you can play well in these situations, you can play well at microstakes. These three situations are actually seven scenarios you'll have to face at the table:

* You raise and end up out of position (acting first on later streets)
* You call and end up in position (acting last on later streets)
* You raise and end up in position
* You call and end up out of position
* You raise and end up acting second in a three-way flop
* You call and end up in position, but in a three-way flop
* You call in the big blind and end up out of position in a three-way flop

As people show proficiency in all of these situations, I will add more. But to start with, there will be just one. And you will train in this situation (against other people!) **until your results match the average of all other players**. Please understand: there is absolutely no reason to want to progress to new situations. Train just one until you do well in it! If you can't get your results up, ask other people on /r/rangevsrange how their strategies differ. Or just see if you can tell what your opponents are doing better than you! And, as I said, I'll be around to discuss it all too.

Now, once you're doing better-than-average, it makes sense to move to a different situation and get good at that too. Slowly, you will get good at lots of different situations. Later, I will add situations like this so you can target more specific parts of your game:

* The flop has an Ace, potential straight draws, and potential flush draws, and the out-of-position player makes a continuation bet (having bet preflop).
* The same flop when an in-position player was pre-flop aggressor and makes a continuation bet.
* The same two situations as above, but the flop has a King and two lower non-coordinated cards. E.g. Kh 8d 2c.
* The big blind calls a bet and then donks into the flop.

But, to repeat: *we will start with only one situation!* Most of what you will learn will be in this one situation. And most of what you learn will help in every other situation. The nuances of other situations are very minor compared to just playing good post-flop poker in even one situation!

Well, that's pretty much it. There's a lot more to talk about, like how to use the software, what it means, and I'll give you a few tips on how to start with strategy, and how to get the most out of it. There will be lots of concepts to discuss. The training schedule will change as I think about it more, and discuss it with the you and the rest of /r/poker. I'll help you out, and if you show good results and can't afford to deposit online, I might even stake you.

I hope that what we achieve, together, is a realistic, useful and even fun training programme. And I hope it proves to be an **effecient** way to learn poker, and maybe even **sufficient** by itself. All I ask is that you put in the effort, and give it your best shot. **Who's in?**

Range vs. Range is now closed to the public, pending the start of this program. If a few people show interest in this, in a few days once I have the training schedule set up, and we have had a chance to discuss it, I'll be opening the site on an invitation-only basis.

If you're interested, you can leave a comment here, message me, or subscribe to /r/rangevsrange.

1329039973.0,21,self.poker,plx08,I am feeling AWESOME tonight.  I played this KK hand *perfectly* and I feel great about it.  ,BrianBoyko,42,21,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/plx08/i_am_feeling_awesome_tonight_i_played_this_kk/,"0.25/0.50 cash game.  All the players are very good - I am probably the weakest player at the table, which isn't saying much. To give you an idea of why I play at this game, it's because I'm trying to learn to be a better poker player, and other than coaching, the best way to get better at poker is to play players better than you.  (For stakes you can afford, of course.) 

Right now, I'm up to $70, and we are 6-handed, but I'm still the short stack at the table. 

And I'm UTG, dealt KK.  

I raise to $1.50, 3x the big blind.  

Folded to Button, who 3-bets to $5.50.

(Awesome!)

SB then 4-bets half his stack to $30.  

(REALLY AWESOME!)

BB (a competent TAG) then *shoves* for $90.  

(...waaaaaait...) 

BB is a very tight player, same skill level as myself.  And her 5-bet range?  Well, there's AA, KK, QQ, and AK.  AK would probably call and try to flop an A or K, as the 4-better's range includes AQs, TT, JJ, QQ... So I'm ruling that out.  QQ... again, I think she would flat call and this time try NOT to hit an A or K, to try to get JJ/TT to pay off (they might fold to a shove, after all.)  And KK... well, KK, I'm only calling for half the pot, and I've got two blockers to it.  

Her range is Aces.  Her range is *Aces.*  

But I still tank, and for a good long while, too - enough that I apologize to the table.  I mean, seriously, kings preflop?  There is only ONE hand that KK doesn't dominate, and that's AA. My read could be wrong, she could have QQ, or maybe JJ here.  It's almost never wrong to get your money in preflop with KK.  And such good money it is too... I could triple up here... and if I'm wrong, I could just say that KK vs AA is just ""the cost of doing business.""  

""Sorry guys, if you know what I had, you will understand why I'm tanking so long."" 

I count and stack my money, and I seriously, really think about this.  And then I say: ""BB, I'm giving you a **huge** amount of respect here."" I fold, and hold onto my cards. 

The cutoff folds.  Button calls.  The SB had QQ.  BB turns over her cards.  ***Pocket Aces.***

I triumphantly flip over my pocket kings, and *literally* (and I mean literally) jump for joy.  That was the sickest, hardest laydown I made in my entire life, and I was *right*.  

I feel so AWESOME right now.  ",,False,,t5_2qhix,True,,,True,t3_plx08,http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/plx08/i_am_feeling_awesome_tonight_i_played_this_kk/,

1298925507.0,25,self.poker,fujeq,Weekly reddit poker games - Full details for newcomers. And this week has EU-friendly start times!,mlloyd67,30,5,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/fujeq/weekly_reddit_poker_games_full_details_for/,"Hi everyone. Here's a long thread but, based on the influx of new players recently, I thought it'd be nice to summarize the reddit poker tournaments and bring everyone up to speed.  

For those joining us, we play a variety of tournament games on either PokerStars (PS) or Full Tilt (FT) each week. Usually reasonably priced No Limit Hold 'em (NLHE) games but occasionally a variety of other game types and higher buy-in amounts. Based on participation, we have found that Wednesdays have had the best turn outs but still test other days occasionally.  

A schedule of upcoming events is kept in a public Google Calendar that you should subscribe to and never miss a game. The [Tournament Calendar](http://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=90ffr9qqsphlbg0hrmrop95qi0%40group.calendar.google.com) link is in the right side bar. Full details are in each calendar entry but I usually post a new topic to reddit with the details on Monday/Tuesday of each week.  

I schedule the games to start at :05 past the hour and allow for late registration. Thus, if you're running late, you have until :15 past the hour to get in. Of course signing up early is always the surest way to not get locked out! You can find the tournaments on either site by looking through the (tournaments|private games) or by doing a search-by-tournament_id - ""ctrl-t"" and entering the tournament IDs posted.  

The [Reddit Poker Standings](http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=t1BoIODBV3g1maHuqcoPacg&amp;output=html) link, also in the right side-bar, is a shared Google doc that records the games we have played in the past, including number of players per game, running-times, type of games, finish order, etc. A score is kept based on buy-in and finish position. The more you play, the more you can accumulate. This is purely for bragging rights and was last cleared to zero on 1/1/2011. Separate standings are kept for PS and FT.  

My personal plea: These are **friendly games** and we often banter, share hands, and discuss strategy during the game - tactics we'd possibly do differently outside reddit. Further, it's not uncommon to see money-added tournaments and/or self-inflicted bounties. **So please do not give out the passwords to non-redditors.**  

Bottom line, we're here to have fun and welcome you to join us! That said, on to this week's challenges!

However, given he doesn't have a big chance of winning, it'd be more interesting to see the comparison between Obama and Romney.

So, are there any good reasons to vote for either one of them? Or it doesn't even make a difference?

One day you find a pack of cards on a footpath, no one is around, so you pick them up and in doing so, rub your finger along the box.  A large blue genie erupts out of the packet, floating in front of you with his arms crossed.

You ask him if you get 3 wishes, and he says: ""No.  You get your choice of 8!  8 powers, wonderous, powerful powers, all related to the amazing game of poker.  I present to you your choices, and only one, may you decide upon.  It will last your entire lifetime and will never fade away.""

The genie then presents to you the 8 poker powers, which one would you pick?  And remember, in reality you would need to be able to get away with using these, some are quite powerful, and may make you a target, or may make it seem like you are cheating or playing unethically.  (Kicker: These abilities apply only to Hold 'em.)

Now choose...

1) You have the ability to see one of every opponent's hole cards each round in your mind.  Example: In a 10-handed game, you instantly know 1 (randomly selected) card, both suit and value, of each of the 10 opponents in the hand as soon as dealing is complete.

2) You have the ability to see 2 of the flop cards (randomly selected, and in your mind) before the flop is dealt, but after you have looked at your hole cards.

3) You, through some divine universal magic, will always play on the button, never again sitting in the blinds, always on the button.  For the nerds; Imagine that the dealer always passes you the button if you accidentally move it, and *insists* you were the small blind last turn (or the CO, whichever direction...) and all the players/floor managers/security/cameramen will always agree with you about your position.

4) You can see the suit of every card in your opponents hands (all players involved in a hand) as well as the suit of the flop, turn and river cards, before they come.

5) Once a week, you have the ability to grant each player in a particular hand, any cards you wish, and to then control the flop, turn and river cards.  For example, On Tuesday 11am, at the local casino I could decide the next hand I'm in, I'm going to get 22 UTG, limp in, then one guy will get AsKs, another will get KK, and another AA.  The flop will come 2sAK, the turn will come Qs and the river will be a 2.  This can only be used once per week.  You can choose all of the cards involved, but obviously not doubling up on any individual card (Can't have 2 aces of spades).

6) Once per hour, you can read the mind of everyone at the table.  Even if they are not explicitly thinking ""I have 2 aces"" you will know what they know, so if they've seen their cards, you know what they are.  If they are old and forgetful, you'd just wait until they looked again and get the values then.  You could read their mind for tells/bluffs/strength etc.  You would know what they are planning.

7) You can entice someone (1 person) to shove or fold once an hour.  Ie: if you have the nuts, you can make someone call you, regardless of what they have.  To them it would just feel like a hero call and they wouldn't question it.  Or you can make someone fold when you are bluffing, even if it would cost them $1 to call.

8) You have the concentration of a God, and you never have to eat or sleep, you never get tired, you NEVER TILT, EVER.  You can sit down at a table for 6 months and never leave, it wouldn't make any difference.  You always play your A game.",,False,,t5_2qhix,True,,,True,t3_qaz1a,http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/qaz1a/mutant_poker_abilities_which_one_would_you_choose/,

Currently, NLHE is very popular and there are a lot less fish and a lot more grinders online than there used to be, but PLO is still fresh and there are tons of fish to be making money off of at the tables. It's so much easier imo to turn a profit in PLO than in NLHE right now. Granted, the variance will obviously be a lot higher due to more draws and more hands seeing a flop, but from experience, you'll get paid off with the nuts a lot more often than not. 

To get started in PLO, here's a few basic tips:

1. Be able to calculate your pot odds really well. PLO is much less of a game of reading your opponent and more about the math behind your calls/bets.

2. Don't chase draws that won't give you the nuts. A Queen high flush might just get you in a lot of trouble against the King or Ace high flush. Likewise, tread very, very carefully with a straight on a paired board.

3. Pick and choose your starting hands wisely. 6789 double suited is much better than JJ23. At the same time though, don't be afraid to see a flop with some marginal hands. In PLO, you're rarely ever crushed preflop.  

4. Always look for re-draws. Two pair is nice on the flop, but if you don't have a flush or straight draw to go with it, don't get too cocky

I've been playing PLO online for a while now, but by no means am I an expert. I've never even read a book or an article on the game, but it's the only game I'm profitable at online, because that's how bad 90% of the players are online.

Anyway, that's my two cents. Get in on the action while it's still good",,False,,t5_2qhix,False,,,True,t3_o1qfk,http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/o1qfk/learn_plo_now_before_everyone_else_does/,

Goals:

* Simplicity (help text will be avoided in favour of making the interface intuitive).  
* Fast loading (as you can see, no ads or crap to get in the way, calculation code heavily optimised).
* Accurate: rounded to nearest 0.01%
* Pleasing interface (click, drag/drop, animations etc)
* Shareable - the link at the bottom creates a 'permalink' to the results
* Accessible - works even without JavaScript enabled!

One of the best features (in my opinion) is that you can type in your address bar something like: **pocketodds.com/aa67** which will redirect straight to the results for Aces vs 67 -&gt; http://pocketodds.com/AsAc-6h7h

Supported browsers: Safari, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, IE6+ (although IE6 will not be super pretty). If *any* of these browsers have bugs please let me know and I'll try to fix it up.

Slated for future updates:

* Equity option (to combine win and tie odds)
* Pie graph showing likely winning hands (fullhouse, straight etc.), it's all ready in the code but no UI for it yet
* Option to show more decimal places if the user wants (or as an exact fraction)
* Odds for Omaha (likely have to wait a while for that, but would love to add it).

This just went live 30 minutes ago, love to hear feedback and suggestions; and if you'd like to please link to the permalinks in discussions about odds!

Cheers,

1367504494.0,20,self.poker,1djve6,Was this as dumb as it looks?,Maxmidget,39,19,108,http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/1djve6/was_this_as_dumb_as_it_looks/,"2-5-10 Live, 7-handed table. $1500 Effective stacks.  I have been playing pretty LAG. 

Limps to BTN - young, smart, aggressive, and has been opening ~15% of pots, more in position.  He makes it $40.  I am on the straddle with [K](/hearts)[Q](/diamonds).  I 3bet to $160.  Folds to him and he very hesitantly calls after double checking my stack size.  


Flop:  [8](/hearts)[2](/hearts)[4](/clubs)   I cbet $200, he makes it $600, I shove for ~$700 more.  

Without my reasoning - what do you think of this?




~~


EDIT: My defense.  I think he is bluffing here a good amount of the time, because my cbet looks like BS on that board.  I also have plenty of equity against all of his draws and single pairs, and I am pretty certain he doesn't have AA or a set. Running the equation actually makes me even more confident that this is a good decision.  My expected value is: 

(Pot before shove)(his folding%) + (Pot after he calls shove)(winning%) - (Cost of shove)(Losing%) = EV


(1150)(b) + (1150+740)(1-b)(x) - (1140)(1-x)(1-b)


where b = his bluffing % (that folds to a shove), and x = my equity vs. his raise/calling range.  My *pessimistic* guesses at these two numbers are b = 20% and x = 30%, meaning a shove here is ~+$45 EV wise.  My break even points:

If he is raise/folding ONLY 20% of the time, I ONLY need to have 28% equity.

If he is raise/folding ONLY 10% of the time, I ONLY need to have 33.5% equity.   

If he is NEVER raise/folding and this is only a pot odds situation, I ONLY NEED TO HAVE 38% EQUITY.

RESULTS:  CardCounter0 turned back time and folded my hand preflop.

Since /r/ poker has no in-depth cruise ship posts so I figured I'd give one a go. 

Company: Royal Caribbean
Ship: Navigator of the Seas
# of Passengers: 2114

Poker: There was only one table, I think I was lucky to be on one that had a live dealer. Most of the 2p2 threads I had read had me expecting an E-table, on Navigator at least, this was not the case.

The play onboard was the worst I had ever seen. By default, they spread $1/3 with a 10% rake up to $15 taken every $5 (if that sentence was confusing: in a $45 pot, the dealer would take out $4.50). They have an option to spread 1/2 with a $10 rake, I petitioned the casino manager for it as soon as I heard. The min BI is $50 max $300 and you can buy in over $300 up to whatever the chip leader at the table has. The table didn't get going until at least 9pm and the casino shuts down at 2AM, if you're interested in a game, sit down with a drink at 9, chat with the dealer and whoever else wanders over, before you know it, you'll have a full table, 5 on the waiting list and a dozen more hovering around the table watching.

The only advice I can give is BE FRIENDLY and PLAY TIGHTLY. These are the worst players I had ever been on a table with. For example, I witnessed a kid limp/call me w/ AA and check all the way down on a K4T33ss board. You will learn very early that TPGK is the nuts, they will call you all the way down with 2nd pair, 3rd pair, and any gutshot. Conversely, you CANNOT BLUFF AT ALL SO DONT TRY. Are they getting aggressive preflop? They have a PP. They will jam with 77 just as easily preflop as AA and KK. 

These guys are there to gamble a little, drink and have a good time. Don't laugh when, after sitting for 20 minutes, some guys asks the table if this is no limit. Also, try not to get frustrated with the slow play, I can't imagine we were averaging more than 20 hands/hour.

So relax, have a good time, chat it up with people from all over the world. If do all this and play tight, you can expect to pay for your cruise playing &lt;4hrs/ night.

Feel free to ask any more questions about the casino, ports, or the ship itself. I had a blast and would highly recommend it.",,False,,t5_2qhix,False,,,True,t3_16ntzk,http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/16ntzk/trip_reportcruise_ship/,

(Again.),2fouroffsuit,32,10,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/rvfxv/how_to_post_hands_for_analysis_again/,"I'm not picking on anyone individually, but lately I've seen a lot of poorly posted hands in /r/poker and would like to see some changes. The easier it is for people to see what your post is about and read the action, the easier it is for them to provide useful feedback. Win-Win!

I know that there's a link here on the sidebar ----&gt;
http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/mlaxu/how_to_post_hand_histories_to_poker_for_analysis/ that says how to post a hand. But it is below the fold so maybe people aren't seeing it, or are skipped over it. So I'll summarize and add a few suggestions of my own.

* Title: In your title it isn't useful to post ""Did I play this right?"", ""What should I do?"", ""How would you play this"", etc... If you're posting a hand for analysis, people will tell you these things. What you want to have in there is the STAKES and type of GAME that the hand was at example: 2NL, 5PLO, 1/3 Live, 100NL Zoom, $125 Tourney, etc... And then give a BRIEF DESCRIPTION. Ex: ""50NL 6m 2pair on flush turn""  or ""2nl Zoom check-raised on dry flop""

* The Hand: Please convert your hands. It's so much easier to keep track of stack sizes, action, and how much is in the pot. You can do it here: http://www.handconverter.com/ Select ""Reddit Poker"" under Ouput. It's also helpful to cut off the action at the point where you're asking the question. For live hands you can use: http://www.handconverter.com/tools/generator or the [A](/spades)[4](/hearts) markup, but make sure that you include stack sizes, positions, clear description of the action, etc...

* Reads: Include reads. Please be as detailed as you can be here.  If you have literally zero reads that's ok, but the more info you give, the better advice other posters can give.

* Results: Please don't include the results. 

* Post what you think: Make an effort to figure out what the best play is and why. /r/poker (or any other poker forum) is not here to spoonfeed you answers. Putting in some extra effort to figure out what would be best before posting will help you be able to ask the right questions, help people responding to your post, and eventually help you get better at poker!

If anyone else has anything to add, please do. Maybe we can make the original guide more prominent or add something on the submit page?


Good luck.

1328614605.0,21,self.poker,pek8m,Playing shortstack live at a casino: A short summary,xatmatwork,31,10,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/pek8m/playing_shortstack_live_at_a_casino_a_short/,"So I was PM'd asking about how I play shortstack at a casino.  Now while I'm not the most seasoned player this has worked well for me so far.  Please feel free to criticize or provide more feedback.

Let's say the blinds are $1/$2, and the other people at a 9 seated table have over $150 behind, in fact most have over $200.  This shouldn't be that rare.  You're seeing standard opens to over $10, like somewhere in the $14+ region would be amazing but anything over $10 is good.  You should definitely, for maximum profit, be sitting in with near the minimum buyin.  I'd say aim for around $50 to $60.  

The reason for this is that when people are considering their opens, etc, they are going to consider the majority on the table.  So when someone opens with their 89s, they (should be) raising to a level where approximately three pot sized bets, one on each of the following streets, would get the average player all in.

You can profit **massively** from this in **any** position.  Not only this but by buying in with less, you are reducing the chance of running out of money since you have more buyins!  The plan is this:

Your range:

Definite shoves:

* 88 and higher

* KQs, AJs, AQ, AK

Depends on your reads:

* 77 and lower

* AJ, ATs, KQ, KJs, QJs

Do not be tempted to play:

* Suited connectors, up to and including JT.  They are too often behind in a shove.  This is the sort of hand you want your opponent to be making bad decisions with.

**Early Position:**

You want to **limp** with your hands.  Allow somebody else to open, and then shove on top when action gets back around to you.  If there is a 3bet, then you will have to use your judgement and sometimes fold.

If nobody opens and you're forced to see a flop, you should have just enough behind to be able to play properly.  Assuming it's a multi-way pot, it's probably sensible not to play anything worse than top pair.

**Middle Position:**

If somebody in early position has opened, then you can shove.

If there is enough money in the pot due to limpers (around 20% of your stack), you can shove.

Otherwise, limp/shove as with early position.

**Late Position:**

If somebody has opened, you can shove.

If somebody has 3bet, it's going to be a marginal decision, use your reads.  If still completely on the fence, lean towards folding.

If several limpers, you can shove.

If it has folded around to you or there is only one limper, this is interesting.

You should consider a smallish raise, fishing for a 3bet.  You have position after all if you do have to see a flop.


After doubling up or stealing lots of money, you are obviously no longer shortstacked and need to start playing proper poker.  However it is important to note you may still not have enough behind to play low suited connectors or set mine profitably.

Some things to note:

* Once people start clocking that you are limp shoving, this will probably cause them to think twice about opening after you have limped.  **Use this to your advantage!** start playing some suited connectors and other marginal hands, which you are happy to limp fold, knowing that you have a higher chance than usual of seeing a flop!

* So it went well, you turned $50 into $100, played good poker and turned it into $350, then you lost it all in a big hand.  Immediately you are tempted to rebuy for $300 because you want to win it all back.  **Don't do this, use discipline.** Rebuy for minimum again, and take advantage of the now even deeper stacks!  Remember you are only down $50 for the night, not $350.

* You obviously need to adjust your range depending on how the players on the table are playing, and in any given hand, how wide the players who are still to act are going to open.  Monitor showdowns - how often did someone open with low suited connectors, medium strength aces and kings, tiny pocket pairs?  These are a dream hand to shove on top of.",,False,,t5_2qhix,True,,,True,t3_pek8m,http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/pek8m/playing_shortstack_live_at_a_casino_a_short/,

Feel free to tell me which party is in the wrong.

**Situation #1**

You know how bad players talk constantly about how they folded the winning hand? Ya know like it matters? As if they should have called a 3-bet pre with A4 cause the flop was 44Q? I'm pretty used to hearing that. What bothers me is players doing that while the hand is being played.

EXAMPLE:

I raise from EP with KK and pick up 2 callers. The flop is 8-8-9. While I'm waiting for my action I hear one guy do a quiet chuckle and whisper something to the guy next to him that definitely contained the words ""I folded"". The guy replies back laughingly, ""Me too!"" Okay so now I know that one or possibly two of the 8's have been folded. Meaning I'm getting a read on players in the hand from people not in the hand.

I bet and both players fold.

After the hand I say something to the one guy about influencing the action while not in the hand. I don't know if I didn't explain the situation right but the entire table looks at me like I'm a freakin alien.

Am I wrong here? This happens a lot where I play and no one seems to notice or care.


**SITUATION #2**

I crippled a guy in a tournament and he was left with slightly more than the BB which me tosses in on the following hand. It's folded to the BB who calls and they turn up their cards.

All-in player has 9-7, BB has 9-5.

Boards runs out Q-T-2-4-4

The dealer says, ""it plays,"" and ships the pot to the all-in player with 97. No one at the table says anything. She's dealing for the next hand and I say, ""Uhhh wasn't that a chop? Pair of fours with a Q-T-9?"" The dealer asks around if a pair of 4's was out and everyone nods. They call the floor and end up chopping this guy's stack in half.

He gets upset and calls me a ""fucking asshole.""

i dont mean to be negative, but what can we do to boost the quality of this forum? i feel like a lot of the posts are ""whats your worst beat ever"" or ""played live for the first time"" .... kind of (for lack of a better word) childish postings that dont build quality or offer any growth (as a player) to the potential reader/s.

what i do like is the postings that involve questions about hands played. it helps people see where they maybe should have done something different. it helps the poster grow, and the people who read the comments grow as well. hand discussion is very important, but this is found on every site pretty much.

also what i like... in contrast to LP.... there arent any people wining about bad beats, or showing Aces that held... over and over and over again. thats gets ridiculously annoying.

1. Getting casino security to escort me to my car at the end of a session.

2. Buying my own counterfeit bill pen (and also learning how to spot counterfeit bills).  This is obviously especially relevant in card rooms where cash plays.

Just a few general questions about playing AK preflop.
Im currently grinding 5NL, want to play 50-100k hands to see how well i do. I probably have the bankroll for higher stakes, but wanna get a foothold on the game first.
Anyways....

I seem to always run into this problem playing AK pre. IS it always a 3bet/4bet or do i play it soft? Should i be folding to 4bet shoves? 5bet shoves? I seem to run into aa/kk alot playing AK too strong.

I also have the same sorts of questions about AQ, though Im not going crazy at all with that, just wondering a proper line preflop in position and out of position, 3bet? call?, should i be folding aq to a 4bet?


Any advice would be helpful!

Hell, I was watching old EPT episodes the other day when they talked about a guy who won online qualifiers for 3 seperate EPT events in a single season.  

It just seems like there is so much more luck involved when trying to survive such a large field of players who are looking to gamble. It's like you have to win 5 coin flips in a row, have your 70 to 30s and 60 to 40s hold up 10 times in a row and suck out on someone at least once or twice just to hit the final table.  

I don't want to come off as someone who is just whining here as it's obviously possible for a skilled player to be successful in MTTs.

I would only play good starting hands, but I would fold at the first sign of aggression.  

After some more experience and study, I became a tagfish.  I still played good starting hands, but I would overvalue medium strength hands in the face of aggression.  

Then, the maniac was born.  Started opening up my preflop range a lot, still pushed medium strength hands too hard.  Didn't know when to apply the brakes.

More study and practice.  Loose Aggressive.  Tightened the opening range slightly and toned down the aggression a little, trying to get to showdown with more of my medium strength hands.  

More study and practice.  TAG . Really started understanding how powerful position is.  Learned what pot control was.  Finally ""got it"" when it came to stack to pot ratio and implied odds.  Learned to make the most of my image and board texture and learned how to launch some pretty sweet 2 and 3 barrel bluffs.  Learned how to fold.  And thankfully learned to reserve slowplaying only for the rare occasions when I had the board MANGLED.    

Still have a long way to go.  I need to get better at a lot of things.  Most of all probably hand reading/putting people on ranges and doing equity calculations away from the table.

He makes a lot of money quickly, but inevitably loses it all. My problem is players like this generally push you out of your marginal playable hands preflop, so you never get to play unless  you luck out with a monster early. Especially when you first sit down and are relatively short stacked. Besides any appreciated advice here, is there a book or article online that anyone suggests to combat this? Opening up your range seems one obvious way to gamble with them, but is pretty hard when you're short stacked.

Struggling on 1c/2c NL hold em tables!",DatHarass,25,5,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/u45g2/very_new_player_lots_of_questions_struggling_on/,"Hi everyone, I just starting playing poker a few days ago and I am really enjoying the experience, but I have been having some difficulty.

I've been powering through the beginner's guide on r/poker, and these are the questions I've been left with so far. 

~ I know this might end up being kind of long, but I'm going to give some prefacing to this first - if you are not familiar with gaming just skip ahead to the next paragraph! I'm a very high level Starcraft 2 player, who has recently decided to check out poker. This is a result of many SC players being very successful at, and also enjoying poker very much; I wanted to see what the fuss was about. I feel I am very good at improving and analyzing, and am the kind of person who will be happy to grind out hours upon hours of tedious work to achieve any minor improvement. I started out on the free play tables, where I went from 1000 chips to 160,000 in less than a weekend (I felt this was an accomplishment at the time, and made me think I was better than I am) With that said, I'll jump into the newbie problems I'm having. ~

The big problems I'm having are these:
1.What are the super fundamental mechanics of poker (primarily preflop, but also general principles)? I've read 'make them call with worse hand' and 'make them fold a better hand', but that doesn't seem to make sense for me, and gives me the following issues:

   1a. I'm dealt AKs on my 1c,2c table, so I'm told I should bet something like 6c (+2 for each limper) from mid-late position (with no raisers before me). Why am I doing this? 

   1b. Why is it better to raise and isolate with a good hand, rather than limping in and calling with a good hand against a larger number of players?

   1c. It seems to me that getting to the flop for 2c and hoping for trips, nuts, or a really nice high card to bet on against a larger number of players is more effective than getting to the flop against 1 player for 20c, only to find your AK matches nothing on the board, and now you have to fold to your opponents bet (As the micro strategies would tell me, anyway!). This seems most definitely to not be the case, but I can't wrap my head around why. If this was made super clear to me I'd really appreciate it!

2. A few questions on buy ins.

   2a. I've read that I should get 200-300 big blinds (or max for the table) for no limit holdem, but I'm a little uncertain on this. From a math standpoint, it makes a lot of sense. With 200-300 big blinds, you can afford to get into your pots comfortably, and pay your blinds, and it also lets you really nail those that chase you on a good hand. Is this thinking correct? Is there more to it?

   2b. I typically play with $1 on zoom or $1 per table on 2-3 9-max tables and generally end up losing most of it in small increments. Is this bad (the buy in sizing)? I am almost certain I would do proportionally better with $6, but I only have the minimum $11 dollars on my account, and really don't want to risk money until I learn to beat the lowest level of tables. Is the $1 buy in really hurting me? Or should I correct my fundamentals before moving to 200/300 BB bankroll? 

   2c. When I play play money tables, I usually have a lot of success. I play conservative like I do on 1c2c, but have a much, much larger bankroll (usually 200-500bb). I don't know if it's the only reason, but I always feel way more comfortable and I do really well. Is this a result of play money players being god awful, or is it the benefit of a bigger buy in? How is it weighted to each?

3. Analysis and improvement. How do I do it?

   3a. I know there is a hand history in pokerstars, but I don't know how to use it well. A generally good piece of advice I've read is 'If you had known the other persons cards and played the same way, that is good'. The problem is that I often find huge difficulty solving this. In Starcraft, the replays lets you see everything from both players perspective -analyzing and assessing is entirely logical. In poker, I'll be in a tough spot and decide to fold. I'll never ever know if that was a good decision or not. Sometimes I win a hand from the other guy folding. I'll never ever know if that was good either, because I don't know their hand. How can I solve this? What kind of methods can I use to analyze my own hands?

   3b. If I were a really, really good poker player (like Negreanu and Durrrr level, etc.) at what rate should my average profits be on a 1c,2 table?
I'm not asking because I want to make money, but rather to gauge progress.
 Currently I am consistently losing on these small tables and would like to know how I can tell if I'm improving. If the answer is ""Durrr would easily be able to get $5 profit from 1 table per hour with only very minimal downswing"" that's where I want to aim for. If the answer is ""well, Durrr would probably be losing all his money on 2/5 tables, and doubling his money on 3/5, getting a total of $5/h"" then I'd be a little disappointed, but be not be expecting rapid improvement over simple fixes.

   3c. Lastly, any tips or resources you'd like to share I'd be really happy to look at. I am often told to play tight on low stakes tables (which I do), but I usually lose most of my money to bets on the flop after raising with a good hand and getting nothing. This leads me to believe that's where my biggest problem is linked to, and would love any advice!

Thanks VERY much for reading. Thanks even more if you can give me some answers. 

 I want to emphasize how much I appreciate this and I'm really looking forward to being part of the poker community if I can ever beat the 1c2c!

~EDIT - Corrected my misuse of bankroll in place of buy in. Thanks for the correction!

     Thanks to everyone for your great responses. I'm finding bits of knowledge through all your comments and am very happy. If I don't manage to get an individual response to you, keep in mind I'm still very appreciative!

I'm not opposed to paying the bubble if everyone is pretty even when we're one away from the money, but other than that, I kind of like to stick with the payout structure I signed up for.

I think, typically, the players chop at two, or even (which seems stupid to me) just take the 1 and 2 payouts as is based on stacks when they reach two players.

That's what happened to me.  I made it to heads up with this old guy.  He had me about 5/2 in chips, and the dealer calls the floor over to say they old guy won first ($900) and i got second ($540).  There wasn't even a chop, so I stopped him and said I wanted to play for it.  Eventually I beat the old guy to take first.

Now I know that is an extreme example, but in general, I don't like to chop, I'd rather just play it out.  I play in tournaments to play poker and win, not make deals.  Is it bad etiquette, bad business, or just stupid.  Tell me.",,False,,t5_2qhix,False,,,True,t3_q9sql,http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/q9sql/am_i_a_dick_poker_etiquette_question/,

1322003754.0,23,self.poker,mm1l1,"Baseline standards aside, what are some tells you see in live games that you can read? (some of my favorites inside)",redditforgotaboutme,24,1,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/mm1l1/baseline_standards_aside_what_are_some_tells_you/,"If you aren't familiar with baseline standards and what they mean [read this book](http://www.amazon.com/Phil-Hellmuth-Presents-Read-Reap/dp/0061198595).

What are some tells that you absolutely, without a doubt can call someone on without having a baseline standard on their play? I will start with a few of my favorites.

**tell** When someone shoves, and says something along the lines of ""Well, I gotta get home"" or ""I guess I gotta call"" usually accompanied by a hand gesture where the palm goes from down to up in a flip (kinda looks like the monopoly guy when he pulls his hands out of his empty pockets. **meaning** He has the nuts, or close to the nuts. side note: 5-10% chance he really has to leave.

**tell** When the flop comes in favor, the player immediately glances at their chip stack. **meaning** he hit the flop hard. This is usually a very amateur move (I was guilty of it until someone pointed it out) side note: usually demonstrated by someone who is first to act, or in early position or in heads up. secondary side note: may also place his hands on his chips, a form of reassurance. 

**tell** A snakelike tongue gesture, where the tongue flips out and back in within a very small fraction of time. **meaning** this is a tell that cannot be consciously made, so it is a very real tell. Usually seen after someone bluffs and gets away with it, or when contesting a chop at a final table and the person gets the bigger %. side note: this tell is RARE, I have only seen it twice since reading Read em and Reap a couple years ago. 

**tell** The BOSS, the villain puts his hands behind his back, leans back in his chair, and basically looks like your boss. **meaning** He thinks he has you beat (and he may have you beat) usually this is displayed by a alpha male player, or someone who is very vocal with physical tells. side note:  DO NOT CALL THE BOSS, unless you have the nuts, or close to the nuts.

**tell** Players eyes dilate **meaning** A non conscious tell that lets the other player know the villain sees something favorable. Usually seen when a player flops the nuts or a big hand like 4 of a kind. side note: only available as a tell on light colored eyes, sunglasses and dark eyes prevent this tell from being seen. 

I would make this ten times longer if we covered baseline standards. Personally this is one of my favs after baseline standards. **baseline standard tell, The Spring** when a player, who is almost mush at the table (leaning back, slouching, not paying attention) all of a sudden this player gets good hole cards or hits the flop hard and they literally ""spring"" up, both physically and vocally (the tenor will raise in the voice). **meaning** they like what they see, the like it ALOT and will raise, play aggresively, mostly seen by nits and TAG's who get bored at the table and finally get a good pocket pair. side note: you must have a baseline standard on someones posture to master this tell, although less experienced players will show this tell quite a bit. 

Hope this has helped a couple people, or made you think about other players in live games and what they are looking for. Go ahead guys, list em up, what do you got as a favorite tell that you regularly spot.

A last-minute snafu killed my bankroll (my electricity bill got charged four times, not one, so until the bank gets it's act together, I'm actually down $1,000 in my bank account.  For that reason, I only took about $325 with me, instead of the planned $500.  

First night, I played a $60 buy-in tourney at the Luxor with about 27 players. My work-friend Greg gave me $20 before I went, and I told him I'd use it as 1/3rd stake in the rouney.   Had fun, and played well.  I finished in 4th place, just in the money.  I took back $140, tipping $20 to the dealers, so after the tip and Greg's $40, I'm up $40.  

Second night, I headed to the MGM grand for the 1/2 NLHE cash games.  Here's the good news - I won.  The bad news - I shouldn't have. 

I had intellectually thought about the reality playing, but I was playing scared money.  When I got my $200 worth of chips, I realized I was over my head - especially when I had two really good players to my left and right, the game was not soft at all.  

I only won one pot, but that was enough. I was on the button, holding [K](/spades)[Q](/spades). Middle position raises to $20, I call, BB calls.  flop comes [8](/spades)[4](/spades)[6](/hearts). It's checked to me - I take the free card. There's $60 in the pot. 

The turn is the [K](/diamonds) which gives me Kings w/ a Queen kicker.  

The BB goes all-in with a $80 short-stack.  The MP goes all-in with his $100 stack.  

I count my outs.  Assuming nobody hit a set of kings and was slowplaying the flop, I think they both hit -a- king, or a 2p-kings.  I think I'm slightly behind here.  

However, I do have a 28% chance of improving, and it's $100 to call to win a total $340 pot.  And that's assuming my king isn't winning right now.  I probably wasn't getting good pot odds to call, but I did.  River's a queen, and my 2P beats BB (lower 2P, slowplayed) and MP (AKo).  

I end up taking down the pot, and doubling up.  I also lose a pot, but I did not lose nearly as much as I won, I ended up at a little north of $300, when I realized that I wasn't having fun, I was nervous, and there was just too much damn money on the table for me to feel comfortable.  I racked up and left, making my total win for the table around $100. 

All in all, I'm up $140, and I think I'll stop here.  

One last thing. 

I went sightseeing after the cash game, and saw the [Bellagio fountains](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8V_Y31GZRo&amp;feature=channel_video_title); and stopped by the Aria.  

And I got this picture - with my all time favorite pro player: 

[http://i.imgur.com/o3I0n.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/o3I0n.jpg)

All in all, fun.

----

**Bankroll:**

Start by buying in to a 1c/2c shallow table for 40c. **Set your buy-in preferences to top you up to 40c.** Stick to full tables, not ones with empty seats (the blinds come around less often). Look for tables with the highest percentage of people seeing the flop.

Basically, you need 20 buy-ins at the lowest stakes (2NL), then 10 buy-ins for each additional level, and to move up you first have to accumulate 5 buy ins at the next level.

**Always leave when you get up to twice your buy-in, or 5% of your bankroll, whichever is greater.**

You're going to start at shallow tables until you've won some money. Play at 1c/2c shallow until you have $16 (20 buy-ins), then move to $2NL full-stacked (100bb deep). **After this you will always buy in for the maximum 100bb**.

Here are the details:

Less than $16, play 1c/2c shallow **buying in with at most 5% of your bankroll** (or the minimum buy-in of 40c).

Less than $40, play $2NL **buying in for 5% of your bankroll**

At $65 ($40 + $25), take a shot at $5NL

Less than $90, play $5NL

At $140 ($90 + $50), take a shot at $10NL

Less than $190, play $10NL

At $315 ($190 + $125), take a shot at $25NL

Less than $440, play $25NL

At $690 ($440 + $250), take a shot at $50NL

If you lose your 5-buy-in shot at the next stake, you just drop back down.

**Edit:** Don't leave yourself with less than 40c in your account, because you can't buy in with that. You might have to sit at a table with more than 40c (but never more than 79c) to make sure you don't get stuck with some you can't play with.

----

** Strategy: **

First, recognise that your strategy will change (slowly) as you move up in stack size (from 40bb to 100bb), and it will change slowly as you move up in stakes after that.

That said, [here's is my post](http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/dme6p/reddit_challenge_talking_strategy_for_40c_nl_he/) about how best to play 40c. Read it, and then discuss it!

----

** Sitting: ** 

Don't pay the blinds at a table with more than one empty seat.

When you join a 9-handed table, paying late-position blinds for your first hand is okay, as long as you're close to the button (ideally the cutoff). Otherwise, wait until you're in the big blind.

If you get deep, and the players on your immediate left are deeper than the players on your immediate right, don't pay the blinds. This is because you're more likely to lose to the person on your left (who has position on you), and more likely to double up off the person on your right (who you have position on).

Don't withdraw money. Except to buy HoldemManager or PokerTracker. I think the appropriate time to do this is before you take a shot at $25NL. But I actually suggest you get the trial version of this ASAP, because it will help you get off the ground.

----

** Multitabling **

There's nothing wrong with multitabling from a bankroll management perspective, but only do this if you're pretty sure it won't affect the way you play. It's very important that you have the time to think through each decision.

----

** If you bust: **

If you bust, you can try again on the condition that you have been following all the rules, and you have been discussing strategy, and hands, and you believe you know what mistakes / room for improvement there has been in your game. Convince Estoeth of this, and you can try again.

** Take Two Promotion **

[Full Tilt's Take Two promotion](http://p.fulltiltpoker.com/take-2) is starting in a few days, and it is an exceptionally good way to pad your bankroll when you are starting off. When I was starting a bit over a year ago, Full Tilt ran this promotion, and it made a massive difference.

** Rakeback **

If you're creating a new Full Tilt account, you need rakeback **first**. I'm with RakeTheRake, and they're great. There's a monthly freeroll that has a prize pool equivalent to about a $40 buy-in. If you use this referrer link: [http://www.raketherake.com/?Refer=1051071](http://www.raketherake.com/?Refer=1051071), you'll get 27% of your rake back and I'll get 4%. If you don't, you'll still get the same 27% rakeback, but RakeTheRake will keep the additional 4%. (I would recommend RakeTheRake even if you're not using my referrer link.)",,False,,t5_2qhix,True,,,True,t3_dorkh,http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/dorkh/the_reddit_challenge_i_give_you_1_you_turn_it/,

My company has access to a billion-hand database, and we’ve decided to put it to use analyzing this year’s WSOP hands.  

Here’s our first hand analysis, from the final table of the Millionaire Maker.  (Link to a video of the hand: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ9TLoIBvrY)

Blinds 40k/80k, 10k antes  
8-handed  
Chen opens to 160k UTG w/KhJh, Kelly flats in the cutoff with 2d2h
(Pot 520k)
Heads up to a flop of Qd9c9s
Chen continues for 180k, Kelly raises to 450k, Chen calls
Turn 2c
Chen checks, Kelly bets 675k, Chen folds

Today, we’re answering the following questions:  
1) What’s the typical range of a c-bet in Chen’s spot?  
2) How often does Kelly’s raise induce a fold?  
3) What’s the typical range of a bet/call in Chen’s spot?  

Our overall conclusion is: the historical data provide fairly strong support for Kelly’s flop raise, and turn bet.  

1) What’s the typical range for a c-bet in Chen’s spot?  

We found 19,988 similar spots in our database.

Across those hands, the range for a c-bettor in Chen’s spot was: 
- 42.8%: one pair (aka “air”)
- 47.7%: two pair
- 7.5%: trips
- 1.7%: boat
- 0.3%: quads

Takeaway: historically, the c-bettor has air almost half the time.  So raising is definitely worth a look.  

2) How often does Kelly’s raise induce a fold?  

In our 19,988 similar hands, the player in Kelly’s spot raised the c-bet 2,650 times, with the following reactions from the player in Chen’s spot:
- 45.5%: fold
- 39.5%: call
- 15.1%: re-raise

Takeaway: even under conservative assumptions, Kelly’s raise is historically +EV.  When Chen doesn’t fold (54.5%), let’s assume Kelly never sees his 450k again.  When Chen folds (45.5%), Kelly wins the 700k in the pot.  Thus, Kelly’s raise is historically worth a minimum of (54.5% * -450k) + (45.5% * 700k) = ~73k.  

3) What’s the typical range of a bet/call in Chen’s spot?  

We found 1,046 similar spots in our database.

Across those hands, the range implied by a bet/call in Chen’s spot was: 
- 30.4%: one pair (aka “air”)
- 56.2%: two pair
- 9.8%: trips
- 2.9%: boat
- 0.8%: quads

Takeaway: the historical range for a player in Chen’s spot has improved dramatically – almost 70% of his range is two pair or better.  Going for full value (i.e. after filling up on the turn) is now worth considering.  

*In case you’re wondering, my company is developing analytic products for the poker industry.  We think this is a *very* cool use of a billion hands.  

**The billion-hand database is comprised of online hands played for real money (i.e. no play money hands).  Hole cards are exposed, but the hands have been fully obfuscated.  Player names and hand identifiers are anonymized, timestamps are removed, blind levels have been grouped for ring games (ex: we can’t tell the difference between $5/$10 NLHE and $10/$20 NLHE), suits have been randomly morphed, and hole cards and flops have been randomly reordered.  Although we can’t identify the source(s) of the hands, we can say that we have approval to use them for hand analyses like this one, and that we don’t owe anything to the source(s) – legal, financial, or otherwise – with the exception of nondisclosure.  

***The definition of “similar spot” is necessarily fuzzy, because even in a billion hands, truly exact matches are hard to find.  For example, in this analysis, Q88 rainbow flops are included, and in the future, other small relaxations will be made (likely on an ad hoc basis) to the criteria by which we define similarity.  That said, we are hopeful that the reddit reader will not let the perfect be the enemy of the good – these relaxations add variance, but not even close to enough to throw the baby out with the bathwater.

1368558123.0,21,self.poker,1ebyai,The Four Noble Truths of Poker,FootofGod,31,10,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/1ebyai/the_four_noble_truths_of_poker/,"There's actually been a fair bit of Buddhism-minded poker work done. I remember seeing an ""eightfold path to poker"" series on deucescracked, but I didn't view it because I'm not a subscriber. So this is probably much in the same light of other works, but I decided to make my own, mostly just to reiterate to myself what is important in light of some frustrating runs recently that have caused me to revert to less mindful habits.

**The Four Noble Truths of Poker**

**1. Dukkha** The truth of suffering  
Poker is unavoidably suffering. You will run bad, you will get sucked out on, you will lose money to players who almost seem to mock you with their bad play and never get it back. It will probably be worse than you're willing to imagine at times. The better you run, the worse it becomes. Look at Phil Hellmuth: he's a player with untold millions, who has no doubt run like God time after time, and he's worse off in this category than most of you. I remember him saying in the NBC 2013 Heads Up finals “you'd think someone with everything I've accomplished would be happy with what they've accomplished, but you're not because you had one bad tournament and that's all you think about.” And I think that sums it up pretty nicely. Money, success, results, and fame don't make it go away, and the closer you get to perfection, the worse that last little smudge in the mix looks in contrast. Intense dissatisfaction, frustration, and suffering are realities of poker, they bleed out into our whole lives, and they're not going anywhere or getting easier to deal with unless you find the origin and take the path to cessation.


**2. Tahna** The truth of the origin of suffering

Our suffering comes from our ***craving*** to have things our way in the short-term. And keep in mind, everything but the statistical reality that converges at infinite trials is short-term, so effectively your whole poker experience. Whether it's one hand, one session, one 10,000-hand period, we are permanently thinking “I've got to get some good results. I'd love to run good.” We always want to post a winning session, even if we're smart enough to intelectually know it's impossible. But we always want “this one” to be the one. How many times are players shouting “one time?” If they manage to hit their out and are all in 5 minutes later. What are they usually shouting? Do you think they sincerely hope to lose since they used their “one time?” I don't. Straining over things we have absolutely no control over, which is everything but our decision, attaching to those things, making them a part of ourselves, constantly attributing good outcomes to ourselves and our skill and bad outcomes to unavoidable situations, bad luck, whatever - It's all meaningless, and it is ultimately fuel for suffering.

**3. Nirvana** The truth of the cessation of suffering

There is a way to end suffering, and it is to give up the pursuit of “running good,” wholly, in all of its many forms - posting results, winning money, winning titles, going pro, “proving yourself” and all of these mistakes of the ego and putting only the path to making better poker decisions first. Most people pretend to do this, but we do not actually cultivate our skillfullness as we should because we are more distracted by our cravings to get good hands, win, etc. It is like looking at a garden full of weeds and cutting what comes above the surface so it looks nice – if you're not finding and pulling the roots, stop pretending. Maybe you are putting yourself in situations where losing is more stressful because you are playing at stakes you can't stand to lose, maybe you really want to win *this* tournament, maybe you crave to play for a living. Maybe, even as you read this, you are desiring to manipulate the path to get the results you desire. If that result is anything other than ending suffering by extinguishing its cause, you have already lost, because the mindset is poison. Nothing short of honest intent and effort to abandon it entirely can work.

I could probably still beat 25NL for at least a few bb/100 online, but I don't play online anymore. Most of these hands will be from a live context, where we do need to make some adjustments, but a good online player can find the right answers too. 

Throughout this series I am going to try and emphasize learnings that will save you the most money over the long run. Discussing marginal spots or tricky spots is nice, but it's important to have strong fundamentals. I'm going to focus on these now.

**Those discussing the questions below, please do so without spoiling the answers I have posted, where possible.** If you disagree with something I've answered, give it a day or two before commenting. I know I'm asking for a lot here, but I want to have some good discussion with people's own opinions without having people get spoiled.

Question 1: 

You're playing in a full-ring live $1/2 game with $200 effective stack sizes and against unknown opponents. UTG and UTG+2 limp for $2. We make it $15 with JJ from MP. The BTN flats. UTG raises to $60 and it's folded around to us. Hero ???

My answer: http://pastie.org/private/wwahrgbjjqacrx9s1anvkq

Question 2: 

$1/2 game with $200 effective stack sizes and we have a few more reads now. Folded to us in MP and we raise AdJd to $10 on the BTN (excuse the ridiculousness of folds to the BTN happening in a live game, it's just an example). The SB and BB both complete. 

Both of these players we notice are check/calling a lot post-flop, and we think they are your typical loose-passive live player, if even a little more on the loose side. The flop Js6s5c. 

What is our plan for continuing in this hand?

Answer: http://pastie.org/private/8z91zcb4tp9hsxvd0dfiq

Question 3:

You're playing in a full-ring live $1/2 game with $400 effective stack sizes against V1 here. We've been at the table for 3 hours with him, and we've played pretty tight (partly card-dead, partly no good bluffing spots) and shown down strong hands. V1 is a relatively aggressive player, you note he's raising pre-flop more often than most, and tends to cbet a pretty high %. 

He opens for $10 from the cut-off and the SB comes along (pretty weak-tight). We flat in the BB with 7s8s. The flop comes TsJc4s. We check, and V1 bets $15. SB folds. Hero ?

Villain is a pretty decent regular.  Note we are 250bb deep here.  Basically, this deep on such a horrendous flop I feel like not only are we not doing great equity wise against a calling range, but we are also pretty likely to get played back at, and overall positionally owned by decent players here.  I don't very much like cbetting, as I feel like most of the times I'll be faced with a raise (which I have to fold to), or a call and there are just tons of turn/river cards I don't want to see.  And even on ""good"" card, I'm OOP deep, and likely to get owned.  Don't really like check/calling either and capping my range, making it pretty easy for him to bet turn + river with a wide range for value and bluffs.

Too nitty to just check/fold here on such a bad board deep OOP against a good player?  Just bet/fold, then check/fold turn often when called?

UTG+1 checks, **HERO ???**

Villain is a 58/13 fish.  On the turn here, not sure if we fare better by vbetting turn or checking behind.  Basically, I feel like against his calling range we fare well enough to valuebet, expecting calls from Qx, Jx, Tx, and single spades like Ks.  But, if jammed on I think we have to fold, even with all our outs.

So given the turn does decrease the likelihood of being called by worse, as he could some hands like Tx, 8x, Jx that might pay off another street on the river if we checkback.  And the fact that we have a lot of outs to improve that we don't really want to bet/fold.  Is checking back here better than vbetting?

**River:** [](/7c) (**$11.50**, 2 players)

Villain is an aggro fish.  Essentially I'm wondering the merits of cbetting the flop versus checking back and taking a bluffcatch line.  Normally I'd cbet the flop here, expecting to get value from flush draws and weaker 8x/4x/gutshot hands, as well as having villain make a mistake the times he folds all his overs that had equity to call.  Cbetting also allows for being more aggressive on future streets, gaining more value the times we improve, and being able to bluff more profitably if we decide our hand doesn't have enough showdown value on later streets.

However, with the above said, I feel like against a villain that is fairly likely to bluff future streets if we check behind, the value of checking behind increase.  Just not sure if it's enough to make it better than cbetting.  Also, while I do feel like he's likely to bluff future streets, I really won't have too good of a grasp on his frequencies.  Also we give all his inferior hands a free look at 2 cards.

I think cbetting is best, planning to check back turns, and fold rivers (or check down).  At least against most players that aren't going to bluff turn + river very often.  But wanted some additional feedback.

Vbet river, or check/raise?  I feel like most of villains worse hands aren't too likely to call a river bet (8x, 77, etc).  His strong hands that would call are also pretty likely to bet when checked to I think (any sets he slowplayed, 54s).  And of course he has some bricked flush draws, and 56, that checking might gain value from if he decided to bluff those bricked draws.

Overall, I'd tend to valuebet here, as I assume most villains are more likely to make poor calls with 8x, etc here than they are to bluff their bricked draws when checked to, or make ""thin"" value bets.  But on rivers that typically increase our fold equity, I tend to feel like maybe checking is better since now a good portion of his worse hands are going to be inclined to fold.

Let's Do This.,canadianbakn,25,6,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/14lrww/1_to_1000_challenge_lets_do_this/,"So, it turns out after my last withdraw I have $1.50 on Stars. I'm going to try to grind my way through the micros and turn this into $1000. This should be both fun, challenging (if I bust I need to cash a freeroll *shudder*), and will probably improve my game again since I've taken some time off of online poker.

I'm going to probably play 50/50 tournaments until I grind up to $5, then hit the 2NL tables. I feel like these have the best ROI. I'm chip leader in one right now. :). If anyone has tried this and has tips, feel free to contribute.

Opinions?",Bonesnapcall,30,9,72,http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/1423sj/live_poker_bluffing_and_got_called_before_i_had/,"I was in a hand at 3/5 Spread Limit ($3 - $500 max bet/raise) against a player directly to my right, I had A,K he had J,J.

I did not hit an ace or a king on any street.  He check-called my flop and turn bets.  On the river, he checks to me again.  I pick up 10 red $5 chips and 10 green $25 chips in a single stack totaling $300 in my hand.  I set down a stack of 5 red chips and was in the process of setting down another set of 5 reds when he said Call before I completed my action.  Because he called, I knew I was beat and only left the two stacks of red out there and pulled back the green.  He called the Floor Supervisor and the Floor sided with me because he said Call too early.

My question to Reddit, should I have done this knowing I had planned to bet 300$.  Or as a poker player who's ultimate goal is to make money, profit from other player's mistakes whenever possible (five hands later I doubled up with a Flush against a Set, if I had put the other $250 earlier, it would've been $500 less after the double up).

Edit: From the number of up-votes SoManyHipstersWHY has gotten, I'd say that people are more in favor of exploiting other players mistakes to make money.
