My brother was bashed by some assholes outside McDonalds Wynyard Saturday night, around 3am. He's in St Vincents' now with pretty serious head damage. His name is Simon. We think he'll live.

http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/man-fighting-for-life-after-cbd-attack-20130602-2njel.html

Based on what I've been told by his friends, who were out celebrating a birthday: there were tons of people around there at the time: these assholes bashed another guy, started walking towards my brother, asked him what he thought he was looking at and then punched him in the face. He didn't get involved in the fight, he didn't provoke them, his only crime was being in the same general direction as where they were headed.

I want these guys in front of a magistrate, and I want to try and do something to stop people getting bashed around clubs. The only thing I can think of that might help is shrinking down the time between being a drunken, violent asshole and being put in a police car. So.

Does anyone know anyone who was there? Does anyone have photos, video, or any information the police can use? They have CCTV footage, but clear, front-on shots and **names** are going to be more useful.

And if anyone has some form of actual solution here I'd be interested to hear that as well.

**Edit 1:** Police are looking through CCTV footage now; as a few people have said, there's a lot of cameras on George St, and I'm told McDonald's has provided some footage as well. The people responsible are Of Interest to the police, outside of my brother's assault, because they apparently fought their way up George Street like a significantly less entertaining version of Final Fight. Obviously if anyone saw the fight police at The Rocks would be very interested to hear what you saw.

He's stable; it's too early to say if he's going to make a full recovery but from what I gather it's unlikely he's in danger of dying.

**Edit 2:** Apparently early news has been saying my parents are going to switch off life support? This is bullshit, firstly I don't think my Mum could make that decision and secondly he is recovering well.

**Edit 3:** A witness has come forward and the police have got decent footage of the guys buying McDonald's. Will link it here when they release it. Will ask about whether they paid with cards. Channel 7 has some witness footage, they are checking with the police if it's safe to release.

**Edit 4:** We've held a press conference: Simon's stable, the doctors are changing the sedative balance to slowly wake him. We have been told not to draw conclusions. Mitch, Simon's friend, has talked about the assault (the attackers were white Australians, thank you racist guys in the comments). We've asked for lockout regulation similar to what's been effective in Newcastle, and for more long-term assistance for children in danger so they don't grow up to be thugs. It sounds like the Tele has their own ideas - I put the Cabcharge idea to them at least. Police sound confident, according to media sources.

Thanks for all your kind words and ideas so far. Hopefully we'll be able to spur real solutions.

**Edit 5:** Simon is breathing on his own. He's in no state to talk but he's starting to regain consciousness.

Police have released CCTV footage. It's a clear close-up shot. I'll try and get a copy; 7 provided us with some earlier footage but Mitch didn't recognise anyone.",,False,self,t5_2qkob,1370254578.0,,,True,t3_1fiakm,http://www.reddit.com/r/sydney/comments/1fiakm/my_brothers_been_bashed_and_i_want_a_slice_of/,

Thanks so much for all your sympathy. The support we've received from all of Sydney, and beyond, has kept us back from the edge of despair.

Simon is well enough to speak, and is lucid enough that he can crack jokes about being caught naked. The speed of his recovery so far makes us hopeful that any damage to the brain is temporary - we'll find out more when he's well enough to move around but so far signs are good.

**Edit 1:** As of the 5th he's sitting up and talking. He's groggy from the medication and not remembering everything that's happened since he got to the hospital, but he can remember things from before so that's pretty great. Once the physical recovery finishes, they'll work out how much damage has been sustained to the brain and we'll go from there. We're hopeful, we haven't noticed anything big, but until the tests are done we don't know for sure.",,False,self,t5_2qkob,1370406093.0,,,True,t3_1fmbhh,http://www.reddit.com/r/sydney/comments/1fmbhh/quick_update_on_simons_condition/,

**What do i need for a daytrip?**

Generally a hat, walking shoes, water and food is required (unless you buy food)

Toilets are available at *most* food courts, train stations and hotels. [City of Sydney Toilet Map](http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/explore/facilities/public-toilets)

It's all very approx, you should look at it on a map and work out how long it's actually going to take you. If you stop off at a museum or something, it may take longer than a day to complete the trip.

I've designed all the trips to rely on public transport.

-------------------

**Daytrip 1: Touring Circular Quay** (pronounced KEY, like a door key)

Approx: http://goo.gl/maps/ssHav


* Get off at Milsons Point (on the train), leave the train and walk across the bridge (accessable from the east side of the station).
* Walk across the bridge.
* [The pylon lookout](http://www.pylonlookout.com.au/Visitor_frs.htm) gets similar views as[ bridge climb](http://www.bridgeclimb.com), and is only $11
* Continue off the bridge, head east, and walk through [The Rocks](http://www.therocks.com/)
* Visit the [Museum of Contemporary Art](http://www.mca.com.au/), the main exhibitions are free
* Along George Street there are some original buildings, including the Sailors home, Coroners court etc etc. More info look at the [Heritage Walk](http://www.sydney.com.au/heritage.htm)
* Swing by Customs House and look at the [1:500 model of Sydney](http://www.sydneycustomshouse.com.au/visiting/model.html)
* Walk around Circular Quay, and head up towards the [Opera House](http://www.sydneyoperahouse.com/homepage.aspx). Tourists lap that shit up.
* Head up through the [Royal Botanical Gardens](http://www.rbgsyd.nsw.gov.au/), also have a look at [Mrs Macquarie's Chair](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mrs_Macquarie%27s_Chair)
* Have a look at [Captain Arthur Phillip's statue](http://www.weekendnotes.com/sydneys-most-impressive-statues/) near Macquarie Street and Shakespeare's Place
* Walk back into Town via Martin Place to see the [Cenotaph](http://rslnsw.org.au/commemoration/memorials/the-cenotaph)

--------------------------

**DayTrip 2: Darling Harbor and Surrounds**

Approx: http://goo.gl/maps/ZBjtZ

* Get off at town-hall station
* Walk down market street and cross the Pyrmont bridge ([Sydney Aquarium](http://www.sydneyaquarium.com.au/) is just at the start of the bridge)
* [The Maritime Museum](http://www.anmm.gov.au/site/page.cfm) is at the end of the bridge on the right.
* Head across the waterfront, or through the [Harbourside shopping centre](http://www.harbourside.com.au/)
* Have a look at the Tumbalong Park, and the [Chinese Gardens](http://www.darlingharbour.com/sydney-Things_To_Do-Chinese_Garden.htm)
* When you reach the [Sydney Entertainment Centre](http://www.sydentcent.com.au/), follow the path around the carpark, head to the [Powerhouse Museum](http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/).
* Head back down the same path, and head towards [Paddy's Markets](http://www.paddysmarkets.com.au/) (be careful of fakes &amp; no photography) and chinatown
* Cental station is probably the nearest station, head to that via Belmore Park


Other things in the Area: 


* [Sydney Convention &amp; Exhibition Centre](http://www.scec.com.au/)
* [IMAX](http://www.imax.com.au/)
* Monorail (closing down)
* Light Rail

------------------------------

**Daytrip 3: Harbour Cruises/Manly**

Approx: http://goo.gl/maps/Vnopu

* You could go on a special harbour cruise, or you could just take a public ferry.
* Start at Circular Quay
* Jump on a Ferry for Manly (this will also give you harbour views)
* Once you're at the Warf, Walk down the main series of shops towards the beach.
* Have a swim etc (careful of petty theft). There are some cold public showers in the toilets on the south end
* Take one of the [many walks](http://www.manlyaustralia.com.au/information/what_to_do/walksViews.asp) available around the place, for example the [Heritage Walk](http://www.manlyaustralia.com.au/information/what_to_do/walks/heartHeritage/introduction.asp)
* Take the ferry back into town

-------------------------------

**Daytrip 4: Blue Mountains/Katoomba**

Approx: http://goo.gl/maps/J24Ey

This takes a bit more organisation, but is worth it (World Heritage Park). 

- You will need water/food/Jacket/raincoat/beanie/gloves on this trip (i prefer gardening gloves for the long stairs). 
- Visit the [NPWS website](http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/NationalParks/FireClosure.aspx) for closures.
- [Track Notes + Guide](http://www.wildwalks.com/bushwalking-and-hiking-in-nsw/blue-mountains-katoomba/federal-pass-track.html) - [PDF Version](http://www.wildwalks.com/maps/pdf/nsw-bmnp-fpxx.pdf)
- Take the [train from wherever you live](http://www.131500.com.au/) to Katoomba Railway Station (2hrs!)
- Take a taxi/bus/walk/hitchhike to the Lookout at the end of Echo Point Road.
- Go to the visitors centre and get a map/check local restrictions (safety/fire etc)
- Follow the track to the 3 sisters. 
- Take the giant staircase track (the hardest bit) down to Dardenells Pass, then onto the Federal pass.
- Continue until you get to the railway track, this will take you back up the hill (at cost - pay at the top - last rides 4:50pm), or if you're a cheapskate/badass - take the stairs.
- Then head home

PROTIP: Get the [Explorer Link Ticket](http://www.cityrail.info/tickets/which/explorerlink) which includes return (same day) CityRail travel to Katoomba Station with all day access to the [Explorer bus](http://www.explorerbus.com.au/map-and-timetable.aspx).

Other things in the Area: 

- [Cable Car](http://www.scenicworld.com.au/ticket-options-passes-2/)
- Local businesses/shops etc
- Other walking tracks

NOTE: Once you're down the steel steps, the track is pretty easy. If you're retarded and start walking off the track, it's a great way to spend a very cold night unaccounted for in the park. Prepare properly. Common sense prevails here, pack clothes to keep you warm and dry. Nobody wants to be ""that guy"" where the rescue helicopters and search&amp;rescue volunteers come to find you because of your own stupid mistakes.

Other Day Walks: This has all been taken from [/u/A_Tree](http://www.reddit.com/user/A_Tree), so credit to him [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/sydney/comments/qss12/what_to_do_in_sydney_for_visitors/)


**[Manly to Spit walk](http://www.manlyaustralia.com.au/information/what_to_do/walks/walkway.asp)** This is a pretty easy 1-2 hour
walk, which follows the water and has good views of the harbour, and tends to have few tourists  
Palm Beach has a nice walk up to **[Barrenjoey Lighthouse](http://www.manlyaustralia.com.au/information/what_to_do/walks/barrenjoey.asp)**  
[**North Head**](http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/nationalparks/parkhome.aspx?id=N0019) Great views from here, still has some old defense emplacements  
[**Middle head**](http://www.sydney.com/destinations/sydney/sydney-city/sydney-harbour/attractions/sydney-harbour-national-park-middle-head) Lots of old gun emplacements remain here, which makes for great exploring. Last time I went, I had to bring a torch, some of the old tunnels get very dark.  
[**Sydney's Royal Botanic Gardens**](http://www.sydney.com/destinations/sydney/sydney-city/city-centre/attractions/royal-botanic-gardens-and-the-domain) You can walk around by the water here, past Mrs Macquaries Chair, which is really lovely. (If you keep walking, you'll end up in Wooloomooloo. Apart from the great name, they have a great pie shop called Harry's Cafe de Wheels there)  
**Bondi** Fairly tourist-y, it's a nice enough beach, but I personally prefer Manly beach (particularly considering Bondi beach has very little shade)  
[**South Head, Watson's Bay, The Gap**](http://www.sydney.com.au/watsons-bay.htm)  
[**Bondi/Coogee**](http://www.thesydneyvisitor.com/Bondi%20to%20Coogee%20Walk%20Map.pdf) There's a great walk that goes along the headlands here  
  
**Cheap(ish):**   
[**Manly Ferry**](http://www.manlyaustralia.com.au/information/transport/ferries.asp) This takes 30mins, and offers great views of the harbour as well as the bridge and the operahouse. Has free WiFi too.  
[**Chinese Garden**](http://www.darlingharbour.com/sydney-things_To_Do-Chinese_Garden.htm) (Just near Darling Harbour)  
**National Parks:**  
[**Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park**](http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/nationalparks/parkhome.aspx?id=N0019) The Basin is a nice picnic/camping ground, which you can get to via ferry from Palm Beach  
[**The Royal National Park**](http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/nationalparks/parkhome.aspx?id=N0030)  
**Museums/Art Galleries:**   
[The Australian Museum](http://australianmuseum.net.au/), [The Powerhouse Museum](http://australianmuseum.net.au/), [The Police &amp; Justice Museum](http://www.hht.net.au/museums/justice_and_police_museum), [The Art Gallery of NSW](http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/), [The Museum of Contempory Art](http://www.mca.com.au/)  
  
**Expensive:**  
[**Sydney Harbour Bridge climb**](http://www.bridgeclimb.com/). I haven't personally done this, but I've heard good things about it. Alternatively, you gan go up in one of the towers on the side for fairly cheap, which offers very similar views. Also, you can walk across it for free at the bottom.  
[**Sydney Tower Eye Sky Walk**](http://www.sydneytowereye.com.au/)  
[**Taronga Zoo**](http://taronga.org.au/taronga-zoo) Has great views of the city and harbour. It's a 15 minute ferry ride from Circular Quay. Lots of animals, both Australian and otherwise. 
**Sydney Scenic Flights** ([There](http://www.redballoon.com.au/flying-experiences/scenic-flights?state=1&amp;region=1084&amp;affiliate_id=391&amp;9gtype=search&amp;9gkw=scenic%20flights%20sydney&amp;9gad=7648306813.1&amp;9gag=1480547713&amp;gclid=CLSolKeR4a4CFYokpAod3mN_WA) [are](http://www.sydneybyseaplane.com/scenic_flights.html) [a few](http://www.seaplanes.com.au/content_common/pg-scenic-flights.seo) of these) Take a seaplane ride, helicopter ride, etc.
[**Sydney Aquarium**](http://www.sydneyaquarium.com.au/)/[**Sydney Wildlife World**](http://www.wildlifesydney.com.au/)  
[**Oceanworld**](http://www.oceanworld.com.au/) in Manly (Sydney Aquarium is much better, bigger, and I think cheaper too. You can dive with sharks though, if that's your thing)  
There are various **harbour cruise**s you can take, these usually go from Circular Quay or Darling Harbour  
[**The Quarrantine Station**](http://www.qstation.com.au/) offers really cool ghost tours there  
  
**Daytrips:**  
[**Port Stephens**](http://www.portstephens.org.au/) (Whale/Dolphin watching cruises)  
[**Blue Mountains**](http://www.bluemts.com.au/), Katoomba (Sights include the Three Sisters and Wentworth Falls), [Jenolan Caves](http://www.jenolancaves.org.au/) (Note: The caves are really cool, but quite expensive). There's some great bushwalks around the blue mountains.   
[**Hunter Valley**](http://www.visitnsw.com/destinations/hunter/hunter-valley?gclid=CIX087OT4a4CFYYepAodJBbtXg) (You can do lots of wine tasting and that sort of thing there)  
[**Australian Reptile Park**](http://www.reptilepark.com.au/) Generally less crowded and less walking involved than the zoo, but quite far out (and smaller than the zoo too). Has a nice atmosphere. They have dingoes, devils, koalas, echidnas, kangaroos, and a huge croc there.


--------------------

**Further walks and daytracks (advice from the reddit community)**

 - [Two Creeks Track](http://www.wildwalks.com/maps/pdf/nsw-gariganp-tct.pdf) Killara/Lindfield/Roseville 2-3hrs
 - [Waterworks Theme Park](http://www.manlywaterworks.com.au/) for kids @ Manly
 - [Luna Park](http://www.lunaparksydney.com/).
 - If you want the highest view, do the [centrepoint tower observation view](http://www.sydneytowereye.com.au/explore/observation-deck/) instead of the bridge climb. It's significantly taller, 1/5th of the price, and you don't need to wear overalls.

**I've got a couple of days to spend outside of sydney, where can i go?**

 - Canberra - Our Capital City, 2.5-3 hrs drive from sydney (or 4hrs greyhound). 
 - Central Coast (Gosford/The Entrance/Erina/Avoca and surrounding beaches) - around 1.5 hrs north
 - [Hunter Valley](http://www.visitnsw.com/destinations/hunter/hunter-valley/getting-to-hunter-valley) - Wine tours, all that jazz
 - Blue Mountains - Katoomba / 3 sisters etc
 - Climb Australia's biggest ~~Mountain~~ [hill](http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/nationalparks/parkhome.aspx?id=n0018) (Charlottes Pass to mt kosciusko is 13km return, i recommend doing blue lake visit too if you're a badass)

So if anyone feels lonely or something and needs to chill, I'm here :)

Just PM me :)

EDIT: For those that are apprehensive, no I'm not a creep or trying to ""pick up"". I went through some really deep depression in which I felt distanced even from the closest of my friends and sometimes all I needed was just someone to talk to, someone to meet, so that's why I'm doing this because I understand that some people may be in similar situations. I don't have ANY qualifications in mental health or anything, I don't intend to try and help anyone with a severe mental illness, I would just advise them to go see a professional, this is more for people that are starting to spiral and just need someone there.

Walking along the train I find a carriage that seemed at least not stuffed full. Walk on and the first thing I see is someone running out from bottom carriage. Glancing down, I am confronted with someone punching and yelling at someone else who was already seated. The manlooked exceedingly aggressive. Running back to the door I yelled for a guard. One female cityrail worker saw me, looked at me then kept walking away. Someone else pressed the emergency button but the aggressive man ran up to the main carriage before he could talk. He must've heard me yelling since he was no longer beating up the other guy. Next thing I know the guard is talking on the intercom telling people to watch their kids so that they don't press the emergency button. Thank you city rail, you're about as useful as a rock when it comes to actual things happening on your trains. Actually less so as you can actually throw a rock. =.= Now I'm stuck on a train with crazy aggressive guy running around. Yay.

1338170210.0,89,self.sydney,u82i2,Real estate agents are the new lawyers. Absolute scum of society. (A rant.),Andrenid,112,23,95,http://www.reddit.com/r/sydney/comments/u82i2/real_estate_agents_are_the_new_lawyers_absolute/,"... and domain.com.au/realestate.com.au are equally as scummy.

I'm trying to buy an apartment. My wife and I have saved and scrimped and worked our asses off (overtime, working weekends, etc) and got ourselves into a position where we're ready to buy an apartment in the inner west. 

Enter: The real estate agents.

They outright lie about what an apartment has, and the price, just to get you to meet up with them. The listings on websites will say ""2 bedroom, 2 bathroom, $550k!"" and when you meet with them, they say it's actually ""starting from $680k"". When you confront them, they act all smug and lay on a thick sales spiel about how they can try find something in your price range.

Domain.com.au and RealEstate.com.au are OK with this apparently (I've spoken to both), they're both of the opinion that ""we don't edit, moderate, or censor listings by our advertisers, it's up to them what they put in the ad""... even if it's outright lies.

THEN... those same 2 sites will completely and utterly ignore your search criteria, making it even harder to find the few accurate listings that sort've-maybe-kinda meet your requirements.

""Please show me 2bedroom apartments, maximum $600k""... I ask politely to their shittily coded query engines. ""Sure"" they reply, ""here's a bunch of apartments with 1 bedroom, worth $800k each, and a bunch of 2 and 3 bedroom houses worth $1.5mill each.""

Someone needs to step up and bring some fresh air into this dodgy fucking industry, with an agency that takes GOOD photos of apartments, writes ACCURATE descriptions on the listings, and i'll happily throw all my cash at them (and my first born)... then, we need a website coded by people that understand what $maximumprice means. Hell, i'd PAY for a site that worked well, considering the amount of stress and time it would save me in this already-painful quest to find a home.

I've spent the better part of 3 hours tonight searching for it. I've scoured Ashfield and Town Hall stations, chased after the train and searched the carriage and had my name and details emailed around to all stations in case it's been handed in. So far, no luck.

The Chinese Supermarket on Ultimo Road, just off Quay Street, in China Town has really cheap branded toothpaste with free gifts like cups and flasks and other random stuff. Apparently they import Colgate from Japan and its the 'thing' there to get free gifts with toothpaste. Currently there's two BIG tubes of Colgate and a Cookie Monster or Elmo mug for $9! 

Also, the bookshop under Central Station (at the end of the long tunnel) is ridiculously cheap so is good for gifts. It often has DVDs and half alright new books for $2-6.

Parents won't do a thing about it, they just stand by and let this happen, or join in on the verbal harassment. There is a lot more that goes on, I don't want to rant and lose attention on this post.

I'm a university student and have just started my holidays (I've got 4 months to sort myself out). Places i'm looking at are around Wollongong (I'm a UoW student) or around the city (I've been averaging Distinctions so transferring won't be a problem, doing an Electrical Engineering and Commerce combined degree.)

What i need to know is what is what it'd take to be able to support myself, i'm talking about bare minimum, I don't go out and all I do is study in the library, i'm only every home to sleep, leave home at 7am and come back at 9pm, repeat every uni day. Otherwise i'm working one of two minimum wage jobs, not complaining as i don't have very much experience. 

I've applied for a good amount of jobs far away and will continue doing so until I land one, I really just want to move far away, hence the long distances between the two, are there any other locations that might be good for me? (Currently at south west syd, rough areas aren't very new to me)

**Tl;dr**
How much would it cost to live around Wollongong or city areas, including any bills, estimate for food per month, etc?

I'm not receiving any center link or any benefits at the moment, are there any benefits I can apply for?

I don't have anyone to rely on, so are there any unexpected detours that may come my way?

* Auburn
* Bankstown
* Blacktown

* Campbelltown

Looks to me like a disproportionate number of Western Sydney stations (20/30). Those of you who go through Central for example are safe, but *there's no guarantee they won't expand this list.*

I was told that they cannot provide rationale for the decision because it was a 'management decision' and that it was done after 'careful consultation'. (Which is, of course, why they sneakily introduced it during the university stuvac/holidays amirite). Called again and got someone willing to admit that it was done to 'combat fare evasion' - and that those particular stations were targeted due to 'lots of concession purchases there'.

Gladys Berejiklian's office confirmed this. It was suggested by her office to put any complaint in writing via email, *so please contact Berejiklian* at office@berejiklian.minister.nsw.gov.au (her ministerial email, not her MP one) and CC your local member.

I know some of you are not affected by this, but it's very likely this could expand to more stations - including yours - if we don't put a stop to it now. Sydney's commuters should not be treated like potential thieves, and doing the right thing (buying a ticket) should not be made so difficult.

**TL;DR:** Contact Gladys Berejiklian and complain: office@berejiklian.minister.nsw.gov.au

Too much gimmick or not enough?

I am sad to say that compiling the free events guide might not be a possibility for some time to come. I always enjoyed compiling it and you all have been very appreciative. I am leaving all the websites and resources I used to find the free events below.

----------------

1. **SMH's Metro Critics' choice**. Comes out every Friday. Just search up ""Smh Critics Choice"" on google and click the first link. Or go to http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment and search ""critics choice"". Look for the free subheading. This weeks critics' choice: http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/critics-choice-20120920-267jx.html

2. [**City of Sydney's What's on**](http://whatson.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/search?search%5Bcost%5D=free). Click on the Free events tab and browse away. Make sure you get through the later pages to see more.

3. [**Family Fun in Sydney**](http://familyfunsydney.blogspot.com.au/). The person who runs this blog is amazing. Great compiled events of family oriented events in and around Sydney. Just look for the free ones. Also has a nice Google Calendar/twitter.

4. [**ABC's The Big Diary**](http://www2b.abc.net.au/EventCentral/View/Search.aspx?p=0&amp;ci=0&amp;pm=2&amp;m_ctrlSearchExtended_m_hdnJavaScriptEnabled=true&amp;DateSelector=range&amp;LocationSelector=region&amp;PostcodeSuburbID=0&amp;RegionID=31&amp;FirstDisplay=False&amp;c=-1&amp;SearchDateRange=0&amp;esd=&amp;eed=&amp;StateID=2&amp;RegionDropDown8=-1&amp;RegionDropDown7=-1&amp;RegionDropDown6=-1&amp;RegionDropDown5=-1&amp;RegionDropDown4=-1&amp;RegionDropDown3=-1&amp;RegionDropDown2=31&amp;RegionDropDown1=-1&amp;PostcodeSuburb=&amp;cat=-1&amp;subCat1001=-1&amp;subCat1002=-1&amp;subCat1003=-1&amp;subCat1004=-1&amp;subCat1005=-1&amp;subCat1006=-1&amp;subCat1007=-1&amp;subCat1008=-1&amp;subCat1009=-1&amp;subCat1010=-1&amp;subCat1011=-1&amp;subCat1012=-1&amp;subCat1013=-1&amp;subCat1014=-1&amp;subCat1099=-1&amp;subCat1202=-1&amp;Keywords=&amp;Audience=-1&amp;ofe=true&amp;FindEventButton2=Show+Events). Many local listings of events. The link provided has the free and Sydney filter applied.

5. [**Timeout Free events listing**](http://www.au.timeout.com/sydney/events?name=&amp;keyword=&amp;letter=&amp;category=&amp;date=&amp;special=free&amp;section=&amp;tag=&amp;order=). There are some good free events listed on here.

6. Check [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com.au/directory?loc=Sydney%2C+New+South+Wales%2C+Australia&amp;is_miles=False&amp;slat=-33.87&amp;slng=151.21&amp;radius=100&amp;lat=-33.87&amp;lng=151.21&amp;price=1) periodically to see if there are any ticketed free events in Sydney

7. [Sydney Talks](http://www.sydneytalks.com.au/) is a great place to see all upcoming talks around Sydney. Usually it shows which ones are free and I just include them. Thanks to a redditor who introduced me to this website. 

8. For more lectures and talks and other events around Sydney I have found going to major universities events page to be quite useful. [Sydney Uni Events](http://whatson.sydney.edu.au/events/) and [UNSW events](https://www.unsw.edu.au/events). For both, just search free or I think UNSW has an option to filter out only free events.

9. Check major council event pages for some local events e.g. Burwood Council, Holroyd and Parramatta to name a few that have many events throughout the year.

10. A nice visual way to see some free events is over at [Weekend Notes](http://www.weekendnotes.com/sydney/free-events/). Has some out of Sydney stuff as well.

11. Check out the free events listings @ [Sydney Olympic Park](http://www.sydneyolympicpark.com.au/whats_on/free_activities_events). They usually have many free events.

12. [Everguide](http://everguide.com.au/arts-and-culture/news/sydneys-top-five-freebies-october-19--21.aspx) put out a weekly free events guide. This one is pretty artsy and music oriented. Still cool of course.

13. Museums around Sydney have some pretty good free events. [MCA](http://www.mca.com.au/whatson/all/?price=free) and [Art Gallery of NSW](http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/calendar/type/free/) come to mind. 

14. My favourite FM radio stations [Eastside FM 89.7](http://eastsidefm.org/blogs/eastside-events/) and [2SER 107.3](http://www.2ser.com/news-and-events) regularly talk about their events, some of which can be free. Thankfully most of them are on their website to browse at. I imagine FBi and Classic FM would also have some events to look out for.  

15. On top of the websites I used to get a lot from Sydney Morning Herald's Metro section every Friday, Spectrum every Saturday (both have an events guide with a free category) and the events calendar in the Sydney Magazine which SMH put out each month. I have a digital subscription to these so I would just quickly look them up and add them in.

If I think of any others I'll surely add them on this post. 

------------------

Things I have learned from compiling free events around Sydney:

* Sydney always has something to offer either in the city or in the surrounds.
* Sydney is flipping beautiful. 
* There are many landmarks, communities, festivals, institutions and events that can continually provide you with inspiration, entertainment and experiences all for free!
* This is a very, very diverse city. More than I realised beforehand. 
* As a Sydneysider I am pretty lucky to have this many resources and infrastructures (although not perfect all the time) to facilitate all good interactions with the city and it's people. Got to make the most of it all! 

Lastly, thanks to the many redditors who provided and added more ideas for free events happening out and about that I missed and of course for pointing me to resources I would have otherwise missed. On top of my head /u/psylent was cool at reminding me of the lovely [Parkrun](http://www.parkrun.com.au/stpeters/) and /u/deanoau for the reminder on fireworks at Darling Harbour ALL the time. Also, thanks for all the comments just thanking me and making me feel so good ALL the time. You all rock! I know there are many others I am forgetting. Sorry for that. 

That's all from me. Take it easy.

Basically he has this 'magic' cloth and can of stuff that can clean a car without water. While shooting off his mouth at 100 mph, and while my wife was juggling shopping and baby he started rubbing our car with this stuff. He said he'd just clean a rim and a side mirror, but when my wife looked up he had done a patch on the bonnet.

My wife is not the best at saying no, and the cleaning of the rim looked good, so she paid $40 for the kit. She brought it home and after the usual rolling of eyes when she brings home some new purchase I let it be.

However next time I looked at my bonnet, he'd actually left a swirls of scratches in the paint job! 

These guys must be trained to pick their targets - look for females by themselves, carrying shopping, looking a bit rushed to try and flog their stuff. If I had been there it would have been over very quickly - let alone other people I know who would probably react violently to a stranger touching their car.

Anyway she is calling the company tomorrow to complain and see if they will pay for a detailing to buff the scratches out. I'm sure they will try and brush it off but we will see.

So a warning to you all - if you see a guy approaching you with this stuff tell him to shut it and get lost before he gets started ruining your car. He was nicely dressed and had a badge that indicated he had permission from Broadway Shopping Centre to be there.",,False,self,t5_2qkob,False,,,True,t3_1i9wph,http://www.reddit.com/r/sydney/comments/1i9wph/watch_out_for_the_water_free_car_wash_guy_hanging/,

I'm doing my HSC at the moment and feel an android phone is quite good for practising HSC multiple choice questions whilst in transit or just in some free time.

What this app does:

* Contains full past HSC multiple choice questions for ALL subjects from [Board of Studies](http://www4.boardofstudies.nsw.edu.au/hsc.cfm)

* Options for customising the number of questions and timer settings

* Tried to keep interface as simple as possible e.g. Swipe to continue and landscape mode

* Detailed results page allowing you to visualise, review and go back to correct/incorrect questions

* Includes all graphics and images

* Available 100% offline

It's available on the Play Store [Here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hsc.mchoice) for free for the next 3 days. ~~After that I am planning to sell it for $0.99.~~ **I have decided this app will be up for free, forever.**

It would mean a lot if you could try it out and if you like it, tell as many people as you can about the app. Also, all feedback would be very appreciated.

All the best and thanks for looking. ",,False,self,t5_2qkob,1372635869.0,,,True,t3_1ha6lj,http://www.reddit.com/r/sydney/comments/1ha6lj/ive_released_a_free_app_for_hsc_students_to/,

While I am coming up with that part, I need you guys ideas of places to include. Places can be anything from a good view from somewhere unexpected (Kinokunya Bookshop @ Gallerias), or a quiet place where no one goes but isn't dodgy (top floor of retail section of Lumiere Building, behind the KFC near George St Cinemas), or a place to have a play (table tennis tables @ Tumbalong Park, Darling Harbour, infront of Comm Bank offices).

Overall, I just want to find a set of cool things to do/places to go in Sydney (preferably CBD). I have to write an application for my HSC, who knows, maybe ill turn this into an app.

edit: I just found [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/sydney/comments/ua8b8/does_anyone_have_any_sydney_hacks/), can anyone think of more free stuff?

What: http://blog.reddit.com/2013/05/get-ready-for-global-reddit-meetup-day.html

Where: http://goo.gl/CU2IP (Actual BBQ area: http://imgur.com/2LIHf)

When: Saturday June 15, 2013, Midday (then an afterparty from 5ish)

*****

**Overview**

This is a compulsory event for all /r/sydney members. Anyone who doesn't come will have their default subreddits changed (and locked) to only Brony subs. If you're a brony, yours will all be changed to something we find out you hate when we dox you.

There are BBQ's on site, and we're planning a few activities and surprises to make it a fun day.

******

**What To Bring**

MAKE SURE YOU BRING FOOD... and not just packets of chips. **We expect each person to bring a proper food contribution + a bottle of softdrink/juice/etc.** Feel free to use the comments area to say what you're bringing so others can balance it out. This is only for the sake of fairness, and because we're sick of people bringing a packet of chips + a can of AC cola then pigging out on the meat and beer that others bring.

**We are bringing sausages and bread rolls for all, but you only get some if you bring other stuff to contribute!**

Some suggestions, since people all seem to want to bring muffins:

* MEAT, there are BBQs on site.
* Pastizzis/pastries from a local bakery/patisserie.
* Sandwhiches/rolls (mixture of meat/salad or just salad stuff... or peanutbutter/bacon).
* Pullaparts/etc from the bakery.
* Cake.
* Cupcakes.
* Cake. ;)
* Crackers 'n dips.

******

**Getting there**

Bus map: http://imgur.com/Yw6IU

The 433 goes right past the park and from memory there's a bus stop around the word ""the"" in ""The Crescent"" on that map.

The 431 goes more often, and finishes down at the loop at the end of Glebe Point Road, then you just walk across the park to the left side, where we will be.

There's also light rail, but no idea where that goes.

For those getting Taxi or driving, there's a car park in the park at the very end of Johnston Street, annandale. Go right down to the end of Johnston St and when you hit the lights at the end, go STRAIGHT through into the little driveway, that's the car park.

******

**After Party!!!**

We are organising another after-party along the lines of the much-successful one we had in Surry Hills last year. Location etc to be announced.

I continue to look for another 20 seconds because I didn't want to look like an idiot running out and grabbing my dog. As I was watching I saw the man walk up towards my dog and start attacking it with an umbrella that he was holding, I saw him throw three big blows to my dogs face, and ran outside to see my dog snarling and snapping at the man. I ran up and grabbed my dog, shouted at the man and the woman, and the woman told me she would do everything she could to get my dog put down because she thinks it may attack children, I then said that my dog would not attack anyone unless it was provoked and I watched your husband beat my dog with the umbrella. She looked at me in shock and they both walked off. Later the police called and the police were like we just had to notify you that they called blah blah don't even worry about it. So I've had exams for my HSC for the past few weeks, and yesterday was my last exam and my parents sat me and my sister down and told me that my beautiful, 8 year old golden retriever Cooper, has to be put down because the man made a claim that my dog bit him, which did not happen, which I know for SURE because they walked off just fine. The Council have fined us and my parents have been trying to put it off as long as possible but say they cannot possibly put it off any longer, so Cooper has to be put down in the next couple of days. 
The whole reason I am posting here is because my dog has been my best friend for 8 years now, he's been through my depression with me, bullying at school, ABSOLUTELY everything, and I KNOW FOR A FACT that if someone was trying to kill me, my dog would do everything within his power to keep me safe. 
If someone held a bat up to your head and started swinging, would you stand there and take it, or would you try to fight them off. 
Please help me

Cliffs-
-My dog barked at a man walking past
-Man proceeded to walk up and beat my dog with an umbrella
-My dog acted on self defense and snarled and snapped at a man, showing his teeth etc.
-Man went to the council, said my dog bit him
-My dog did not bite him, I witnessed the encounter
-My golden retriever is going to be killed in the next few days because of self defense.

But honestly he didn't look impressed, also I noticed the previous people who signed gave amount ranging from $10-50.

Of those votes, the vast majority submitted blank papers, or didn't vote properly. There were quite a few ""no to compulsory voting"". There were only a couple of messages ""fuck you and die"" etc.

Very few people voted below the line, less than 10%

You can see the results for your local government area [HERE](http://www.elections.nsw.gov.au/lge-index.htm)

For those really keen, you can follow the post election count [HERE](http://www.elections.nsw.gov.au/prcc-schedule.htm) (scroll down)

Finally, if you've got old people who can't physically get out of a car to vote, you can get them a postal vote. It's a little extra paperwork (they give you a stamped return envelope too!) but at least you don't have to go to all the effort of getting the polling manager out to the car to vote and witness.

EDIT: Please keep in mind, the people who have to look at the picture of the cock you drew on the voting paper have no influence on the voting policy or politics. They're simply hired in on the day to count the votes. Some counters are elderly and don't appreciate the sketches.

1357019929.0,50,self.sydney,15rfhe,There are two kinds of cops: my experience dealing with NSW police. ,,63,13,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/sydney/comments/15rfhe/there_are_two_kinds_of_cops_my_experience_dealing/,"This all started because there's this guy who walks down my street every day who harasses people. He shouts racist abuse and swings his shopping bag at them. What he does is pretty horrible, but it falls short of actual assault, and he normally does it when it's quiet, so there aren't witnesses.  He also only does it to women. 

So one day, I was the witness. I called the cops. A couple of squad cars came by quite quickly and I and the person who'd been attacked told them what had happened. But the guy was long gone, and although he'd knocked her glasses off, what he'd done didn't count as assault, as she wasn't injured. They couldn't do anything except make a note of the incident. Let's say they were *dismissive*,  I think that's fair. 

Luckily, there's another kind of police officer at the local station who *could* help. Crime Prevention officers. They were brilliant. They listened to the story, they took it very seriously, they told us the next time we saw him, call them on their direct line and they'd send someone. And they did. A couple of days later I saw him walking down the street, called the station, and a car was there in five minutes. They detained the guy, got his details, went round to his house and talked to his family, and got him reported to the mental health authorities. He stopped doing it, at least in our street. 

But here's the twist in the tale. **The first lot of cops never told us about the second lot.** They pulled up in their cars, told us there was nothing they could do, then drove away. They didn't tell us that Crime Prevention existed. They didn't suggest we call them. They gave us the impression the police force would not be able to help us in any way. I only found out about the Crime Prevention department by calling Neighbourhood Watch in desperation because I felt like the police had dismissed us. 

I'm not sure what this means about the NSW police, except that they have huge communication issues, but I wanted to tell the story in case people have problems like this and have been similarly ignored or dismissed by front-line police who apparently aren't interested  unless someone is actually bleeding.  There are other cops who will take an interest and help you. But the first lot won't even tell you the second lot exist.

Do you enjoy knowing that people are getting in better places than you by cheating because the only thing stopping them was a little quiz they did in year 11? A quiz, that the teachers practically give you answers for because they realise its pointlessness. 

Do you enjoy a compulsory course with close to no real world application?

How about having your passions dampened with watered down courses?


What about being given a quantitive value on the importance of your subject?

Dont do well under pressure? Cant express yourself in writing? Well, fuck you. 

Look, I'm not suggesting a better alternative. The thing is - I shouldn't have to. The HSC is a bloody joke. 

I know it's not the only way into university but from what I'm seeing, it's sure is the easiest. 

I'm not failing this course at all but I know too many people that really should be doing better than me but arent. Likewise, there are too many people that have no passion for a subject, that cheat, or just only know what they *have* to that are doing better than me.

It's an amazing juxtaposition to the normal bright pictures you see of the opera house / bridge every other day, and definitely worth a look through.    
Fair warning, almost every photo is taken illegally (trespassing, vandalism, etc.) so if you don't want to see photos of graffiti, steer clear.

I got to spend exactly 17 weeks in Sydney from June 2011 to October 2011, doing 16 of them as a Masters student at the Faculty of Pharmacy at the University of Sydney. I ended up living in Forest Lodge, near Glebe. The manager of the house I stayed in was a full on Bogan, my housemates were awesome, the house itself was big, but had its drawbacks. I loved every single moment of being in Sydney however.

When I arrived in Sydney, I got in after a 30 hour journey. Jetlagged, it was 6AM and I couldn't find my hostel. I felt at home however from the first moment I set foot in the city centre, Central Station was great, the atmosphere is something I adored from the first minute.

I met so many people in Sydney, I made so many friends. I fell in love with Sydney, and I envy you people for living in such a wonderful country. If it weren't so far away from my family and nearby friends I would move to Sydney in a heartbeat. I often wonder if Sydneysiders even realize how amazing their city is, the cultural activities it has to offer, the amazing small spots you don't find on tourist maps. 

Just wandering throught the CBD without anybody to bother me, to know me. To be able to feel so alone in such a massive city. Somehow it was something I loved, and did almost every sunday. Going to Manly, Coogee, or even Camperdown and just walk through the suburbs. I loved every single bit of Sydney.

Sydneysiders, I envy you with all my heart, and I just hope I realize the importance and beauty of the city I grew up in. I just hope I get to visit your amazing city once more, and visit [this exact spot again](http://goo.gl/maps/De64l) and [take the same photo](http://i.imgur.com/vycWr.jpg), or just visit the Quadrangle of the University of Sydney. But most of all I want to meet the people which made my stay in Sydney so amazing.

I wonder what everyone else has. Here are some of my favourite places in Sydney:

* **Chowder bay**: A beautiful place near middle head. Quiet, great swimming, good food etc. Great place on a summer afternoon. Also, amazing scuba diving.

* **Gumshara Ramen**: This place rocks, it is in the shitty eating world food court that hasn't been updated since it was built in the 80's. The ramen is pretty much incredible.

* **Pasticeria Papa**: This bakery in Haberfield in a mecca for Italian food fans, incredible breads, pastry and pizza and all dirt cheap!

* **Crosslands**: This is certainly out of the way, located in the backside of Hornsby Heights. It is a really nice place for a picnic or BBQ by the river. Generally quiet, very nice to visit, hike through/from and camp at!

While I am not asking for much I think if anyone is in the area who can make the effort to swing past the Rawson St shop front and buy some crap they don't need it would make a world of difference to a family who has been through enough.

MAKE SURE YOU BRING FOOD... and not just packets of chips. **We expect each person to bring a proper food contribution + a bottle of softdrink/juice/etc.** Feel free to use the comments area to say what you're bringing so others can balance it out.

**We are bringing sausages and bread rolls for all, but you only get some if you bring other food to contribute!**

Some suggestions, since people all seem to want to bring muffins:

* MEAT, there are BBQs on site.
* Pastizzis/pastries from a local bakery/patisserie.
* Sandwhiches/rolls (mixture of meat/salad or just salad stuff... or peanutbutter/bacon).
* Pullaparts/etc from the bakery.
* Cake.
* Cupcakes.
* Cake. ;)
* Crackers 'n dips.

**Getting there**

Bus map: http://imgur.com/Yw6IU

The 433 goes right past the park and from memory there's a bus stop around the word ""the"" in ""The Crescent"" on that map.

The 431 goes more often, and finishes down at the loop at the end of Glebe Point Road, then you just walk across the park to the left side, where we will be.

There's also light rail, but no idea where that goes.

For those getting Taxi or driving, there's a car park in the park at the very end of Johnston Street, annandale. Go right down to the end of Johnston St and when you hit the lights at the end, go STRAIGHT through into the little driveway, that's the car park.

******

**After Party!!!**

We are trying to organise an after party at a redditor's bar in Surry Hills. Those of you over 18 and interested, shout out so we can figure out if there's enough interest. We'd want 40ish people so we can take his entire upstairs area.

I've recently started working in the taxi industry and found that just by jotting these two numbers down, it is a safeguard. 99.9% of circumstances for which you would want to make a complaint and/or have lost property, you will be asked for these two numbers. As well as giving a much faster feedback time for you, it also makes the employees lives much easier by not having to manually search taxi bookings/ chasing up fleets etc

But yes. I never took these numbers down and had no idea how easier and faster they made everyone's lives if something was to happen or get left behind.

So next time you catch a cab, record these numbers.

** Overview **

This is a compulsory event for all /r/sydney members. Anyone who doesn't come will be tracked down, and have their host file modified so that the only site they can visit, ever again, is Digg.

There are BBQ's on site, and a few of the regular meet attendees are planning a few surprises, so it'll be worth the effort to come along. We've also been mentioned in the official Reddit blog as being a potential contender to out-do the /r/NYC meetups etc, so let's make it happen!

** What To Bring **

MAKE SURE YOU BRING FOOD... and not just packets of chips. ** We expect each person to bring a proper food contribution + a bottle of softdrink/juice/etc. ** Feel free to use the comments area to say what you're bringing so others can balance it out.

** Photo &amp; Tweet Strategy :P **

We had our own plan for hashtags and stuff but then Reddit stepped in and announced #redditmeet as the official tag, so our new plan:

- Tag your tweets with #redditmeet to join the masses, and secondary tag of #rsydney if you want your tweets to show up on the rsydney.com.au website (we've got a special ""social stream"" page we're using on-the-day).
- Upload your photos either to Flickr with the tags ""rsydney"" and ""redditmeet"" or just post your photo links to Twitter using the above hash tags.

Tweets and Flickr uploads will show up here on the day: http://rsydney.com.au/redditmeet2011.html",,False,self,t5_2qkob,True,,,True,t3_hbt7l,http://www.reddit.com/r/sydney/comments/hbt7l/global_reddit_meetup_day_2011_bicentennialjubilee/,

Details inside.,petawb,63,16,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/sydney/comments/f7chz/who_has_something_to_say_about_renting_in_sydney/,"Often I see posts on r/Sydney where people are moving here and want to know about renting i.e. where to live, how much to pay, etc. 

When I first moved out of home, I was 18 and made a lot of mistakes. If I'd been better prepared I could have saved a lot of money, relationships and irritation. I thought we could band together and write about our experiences and what we've learned, potentially creating a good resource for the sidebar.

When I started writing my bit to start off the conversation, I got well and truly carried away. I had a lot to say, most of it experiential and personal. So I started writing in a google doc. A few hours later, I got to the point where I wanted to recruit other experienced Sydney redditor renters to start adding their sections.

[I've made an editable google doc](https://docs1.google.com/document/d/1PVsXKUTJyxtq8p0yHfCu1cPEDqqkp6VB1uTW7OZrVVA/edit?authkey=CKiXl8MN&amp;hl=en&amp;pli=1#) but I also have a personal copy which I'll add bits to as I see them written in case we get a troll in there.

When it's done, we can post it to the sidebar and maybe get a less constant stream of 'renting advice' posts giving the same advice.

I'll probably keep adding stuff when I get motivation, but until then - edit away! Any questions, let me know here - but otherwise, don't be shy about making any changes yourself.

Only two rules:

1. Don't delete anything someone else has written (I'll keep an eye out for obvious trolls), even if you don't agree with it. If you have another perspective, write a section about it.

2. Write a blurb about yourself and your renting experience in 'About the Authors', then credit yourself in what you've written. This will give people reading the opportunity to read things by people with similar needs to them. A lot of this stuff is subjective, so this should be a good way to make a good resource. Even if you don't want to identify yourself, or use your reddit username, put some kind of identifier in.

It's usually two or three people out of every thousand that ruin things for everyone, but I just saw probably the funniest/worse case of ""alcohol fuelled"" violence (in quotes because they're often on speed at the same time).

I just knocked off work and went to Railway Square and arrived to a drunk/gassed up bloke screaming while being pinned down by five bus marshals.

He wanders off and comes back, gets into another argument with the same marshal and ends up screaming ""fuck youse all! I'm getting a cab home"" giving every the middle finger and calling all of us ""motherfuckers"" from his ivory tower in the middle of Broadway.

A car understandably toots his horn at him, so he punches it, which causes the driver to slam on the brakes and a taxi nearly rear ends the car he punched. Out of this car he just punched pop out three massive Islander guys, wearing security uniforms.

Obviously dealing with shit cunts is annoying enough at work, and after a long night these guys are not in the mood for dealing with a shit cunt. They show a helluva lot more restraint than I would, and he gets decked once by one of the guys, who jump back in the car and leave. The guy, who was already bloody before this mind you is uninjured and flags down a cab.

Another witness from the other side of the road warns the driver, who doesn't take him. He comes back to the bus stop, tries to jump on the N50 to Strathfield and once again is left out of the magical vomit rocket adventure. He kicks the bus several times to vent his frustrations.

The last I saw of him was when he went running after the bus, down the middle of Broadway, in traffic, from Railway Square, well past where the Clare once stood.

I couldn't help but laugh at times because of how often his actions backfired, and because him running down the middle of one of Sydney's busiest streets reminded me of Borat.

Average.

Sydney is an unusual city to review. There are a lot of positives, and a few severe negatives. So let's go over it!

It's hard to find a renewable energy percentage for Sydney, but Australia in general produces about 1.7% of its energy in the form of renewable energy. Oh dear. It's 5.7 in terms of consumption, but that's still a rather dismal number. In the event of an apocalyptic scenario in which the remaining area around Sydney falls out of contact/mines close down, I'm afraid that the vast majority of Sydney will lose all power.

I'm afraid that civilian population is not well armed, either. 5.2% of New South Wales' civilians are legally armed. I know this does not include everyone, and am not an idiot relying entirely on official statistics, but it does offer insight as to what kinds of guns are held by the general populace.

Furthermore, the definition of ""firearm"" includes in its many guns being registered includes (and by includes, I mean consists mostly of) .22 calibre. For those who are unaware, I've been witness to someone having a .22 ricochet off their head. That's hardly promising in the event of a zombie apocalypse, where that's the principal target. Shotguns are decent, but again, most shotguns are equipped with tiny bb's. This is more than adequate to make someone's day that much worse, but zombies do not flinch, they do not feel pain. That weapon will essentially be a heavy noisemaker. Thankfully, shotgun shells *are* recyclable, and could be modified to include heavier loadouts.


Simple diffusion will help Sydney immensely. The idea of a ""defence line"" seems rather silly, considering how few neighbors the city has except along the coastline. Efforts would be far better spent patrolling the streets. If patrols are stepped up, and militias formed to patrol certain corridors, then hopefully the city can hold together.

IF other cities should fall, I'd recommend a major ""defence line"" be broken up into line most major roads, and areas facing Canberra, with patrols ready to sweep up roamers that wander into the city after taking a wrong turn.

The vast amount of hunting ground (as you border so much national forest) and fisheries that Sydney can operate would see to it that the population wouldn't starve outright, and even without power it's unlikely you'll freeze. (Most modern homes are electrically heated. Thankfully, Sydney doesn't really have this problem.)

This would leave a LOT of Sydney's population free to patrol the interior of the city. They could respond quickly if a dispatch system were created; say a hospital were to start being overrun, or if a block were to report an entire group of zombies, or if there were a patrol isolated and finding itself getting surrounded, a response could be immediately dispatched on foot, as on my visit I found Sydney a *remarkably* walkable city.

**If all should go tits up**

If the pooch is royally screwed, the small island forts in the bay near the Opera House seem quite well fortified. The top of the Sydney Bridge itself might be a safe place with which to sit outside the range of most zombies' sensory abilities.

Boat your way up and down the coast. Try to find places that are welcoming survivors, looking to reclaim new land in exchange for brief residency (and then take up residency in that area.)

If you are forced to flee, take the following items with you:

#1: Fishing rod/gear. That's practically infinite food. They're not exactly rare. You don't have to buy one now, just grab one as you run.

#2: Non-exhausting fire starting material. You can buy this stuff online. It's very useful, even if there is no zombie apocalypse.

#3: A sailboat/sailing ship. A boat is less visible, a ship can take you *anywhere.* Sailing's just a very useful skill to have.

Hey r/Sydney.
I'm back for my second run at the Sydney Comedy Festival. I sold out last time and people seemed to like it so hopefully all of that could happen again.
It's a small room and on in a couple of weeks so if you're interested it's probably better to book sooner rather than later.

That said, if you're skint but really like live comedy drop me a message and I'll happily put you on the door.

Here's a show description - 

This show follows an epiphany junky's search for one more cerebral hit.

James Colley (BBC WORLD SERVICE, A RATIONAL FEAR, PROJECT 52) turns his giant, perceptive eye to evolution in science, myth and our personal lives.

](http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/wikipedia-blackout-a-slippery-slope-volunteer-editors-20120118-1q66v.html)

So rather than enlightening the SMH technology readers about the issues of SOPA/PIPA which can affect even Australians.  They are spinning Wikipedia as the bad guys here not taking a neutral point of view.

At least Wikipedia's blackout post discusses their position on why as a neutral organization they are forced to take this stand.

I don't see SMH come clean with a disclaimer about how as a media/content organization they benefit from people NOT talking about SOPA/PIPA at all!

I bet if Wikipedia didn't get involved, this wouldn't even appear in the technology section.  When China sensors their Internet everyone's so quick to judge, when American/companies does the same, it's buried under the carpet.

Shame on you SMH!  

**Update**

I can only find [http://www.smh.com.au/it-pro/business-it/long-arm-of-us-piracy-law-will-reach-further-than-you-think-20120119-1q791.html](http://www.smh.com.au/it-pro/business-it/long-arm-of-us-piracy-law-will-reach-further-than-you-think-20120119-1q791.html) on the SMH frontpage today, considering that my earlier whinge was about how SOPA/PIPA could affect Australians, I thought it was nice for SMH to at least publish some facts.

Bravo SMH.

Apparently, when tame/pet birds get out, they can fly quite a distance from their home before stopping after getting lost. So even though, such as in this case, I have taken the bird to a vet, she may not be claimed as the owner probably isn't local.

(It has an ID bracelet, so it belongs to someone I suppose?)

On the weekend I was so keen to use it for the $2.50 sunday thing I forgot it wasn't everywhere and got up to Hornsby and then realised - the guy let me out anyhow. Think they need at least one swipe card per station to do the weekend stuff.. But I realise it's a trial.. Still.. One card reader at all stations would be far more useful than all readers at just city circle.. When no one is really able to use it for most trips.

I say thanks, try and move on but he keeps talking saying that, quote ""I had the same glasses as you but walking here today someone stole them!"" I quickly defended myself (What the fuck man? These are women's glasses first of all and they are MINE!) and again try and move on but he gets in front of me again and continues to talk about my ""great"" outfit, then says he wants to chat. I just tell him sorry, I am running late I need to go etc, and then as we get separated in the crowd he grabs my elbow tightly to pull me towards him. At this point I freaked out because a) I don't know who the fuck he is and b) don't grab me, so I said sorry I have to go, bye and quickly ran off into the rain.

Can anyone please explain if he was just a freak or if he was trying to sell me something? The whole situation had got me confused and I would appreciate it if I could go about my day without getting harassed by strangers on the street.

A few weeks ago we had our wheelie bin replaced by our local council. First time out it disappears and an older one with no lid is there in it's place.

We notice the place next door has a new bin and has been vacant for about a month. We took it assuming the garbos made a mistake.

New tenants move in 3 days ago and our bin is now back in the house next door. And I have [this letter from the new tenants](http://imgur.com/hl7Xy).

He comes over and abuses the people downstairs (we're in a duplex) for bin theft and rants and raves about it being a federal offense and not to mess with him.

Am I crazy or is this bloke a nut job?

I mean seriously? He has no history with the neighbourhood and I'm pretty certain there isn't a Federal Police Task Force for wheelie bins.

Anyways. I've called the council to check the serial numbers... and thoughts from other redditors are really welcome.

Cheers

Rob

I chose them because I had run out of time (another printer had fallen through) and needed the task done quickly - ""Fastprinting"", right? I got a quote (quite steep, but hey - fast, right?) paid the money, and expected to receive the package in 4 days like they promised. It arrived 10 days later, and only after I rang them to complain that their delivery guys kept missing my house (I stayed home two days waiting for the delivery). The quality was off, even though the samples weren't, and they ship all the way from Melbourne.

Needless to say, I asked for a refund, and after a bit of muttering, they said ok, send it back and we'll process a refund. I sent it off, and phoned a few days later, and they are claiming they have not received the package. After arguing with the woman on the other side of the phone (she started shouting at me, calling me a liar and a thief) I gave up on my considerable investment, and decided to write a negative review on google, because I didn't want these guys to continue with ripping people off.

A few hours later I got an angry call from the owner, who very loudly and nasally, told me that I was a liar, a thief and a cheat, and that he was calling his lawyer unless I removed my negative review. I refused, and he hung up on me loudly.

In the next weeks, the number of ""favourable reviews"" exploded and the real reviews were now buried, a few even removed.

This was a few months ago, but I happened across their listing on google again recently and there are now 20 reviews on the thing, only three of which are genuine and negative.

Just need to vent... :(

tl;dr: Got cheated by a printing company called FastPrinting which abused me, threatened me, and is attempting to bury criticism on the internet.

I just rode from Melbourne and must return to America and don't want to spend all my time in the city trying to sell my bike so I'm giving it away. You can find it hidden a bit, but not locked, at the edge of some bushes in the garden right in front of the opera house (if you're looking at SOH from two gum trees it will be to your right beside the gate). 

It's a blue large Ried Aquila. It has schwabb tyres that had no flats for 1200k, a great rack on the back, and comfy seat. The rear wheel needs some love. I did a haphazard job replacing two spokes and another is still broken. So that wheel needs trying also. The derailleur may also need slight adjusting but not much. Other than that it's tip top. New brakes installed a few days back. 

Please, just ride it well is all I ask.

It's sick that this kind of thing happens, even more so that people think no one will call them out on it in public.

For free! 

**What I have:**

* ~~Front loading Washing machine, barely used, two years old - excellent condition, great energy rating.~~

* An awesome Ikea desk - large, back shelving for books, stationary, room for computer screen and more. Slight wear and tear.

* A single bed (because you are redditors, thought it suitable, haha) steel, very durable, easily assemblable (no loose parts) - wooden slats included.

* ~~A great Ikea [office chair](http://www.ikea.com/ca/en/catalog/products/10196596/) - new (may differ slightly to the current Ikea offering, but basically the same)~~

* A comfortable Ikea [office chair](http://www.ikea.com/ca/en/catalog/products/S79877709/)

All of these would need to be picked up at the storage space in Burwood in the next week. PM me if you want anything, and when you can pick it up during the week (next weekend is already too late)

If I don't manage to get rid of everything, does anyone know a good way to dispose of/donate the rest?

Hey guys,

We seem to get many posts about people looking for a house/accommodation, while i love reading new subscribers stuff, perhaps it would be helpful to all to put together a FAQ that could go in a side bar. It could be a quick reference for new users to quickly find accomodation; short term, renting, buying, and hotels. etc.

Was thinking of things like

- Websites to find flat mates
- links to legal advice 
- city rail, bus, ferry network maps, etc
- perhaps some crime statistics + house price stats?

So if anyone has some websites, tips etc they want to share, perhaps we can throw them all in a FAQ so it can go onto the sidebar. I will of course reference all the contributors.

I'll start it below.

------------
EDIT:

**I need accomodation short term (aka a hotel/motel/backpackers) and i need it quickly**. Jump on [Wotif](http://www.wotif.com/hotels/australia-sydney-hotels.html), find a hotel you like the look of. Google the hotels website, and see if they offer it at a better rate (many times they do). If not, go back to wotif and book.

- [CityRail](http://www.cityrail.info/) is the network train system that transports the majority of commuters. [Network map](http://www.cityrail.info/stations/network_map) and [as a pdf](http://www.cityrail.info/stations/pdf/CityRail_network_map.pdf) 
- [Sydney Buses](http://www.sydneybuses.info/) is also quite popular, although it is affected by Sydney Traffic. [Route Maps](http://www.sydneybuses.info/routes/timetables-route-maps), [Network Maps](http://www.sydneybuses.info/network-interchange-maps)
- [Sydney Ferries](http://www.sydneybuses.info/network-interchange-maps) connects Parramatta, Manly, Mossman Bay and Neutral Bay with the City (Circular Quay).

As a gay guy who loves arrested development i think it would be great fun to ride up oxford street on the back of a stair car dressed up as tobias, mrs feather bottom, a hot cop or one of the gay protestors that keep appearing in the show.

I have zero experience doing anything like this but would like to give it a go, I'm wondering if anyone else wants to join the fun?

Update:
So i read all the comments and laughed my arse off.
And i did a bit of research and it will cost us $150 to to enter a float, and we need to submit our plan to Mardi Gras before January 4th.

Can't find stair car rental anywhere, but i'm sure we could make a convincing looking one ourselves.

So if your keen message me and we'll organise a time to all meet up and get this stew going.

I'm Snitch and my best mate of 20 years and I do a podcast called the **Snitch and Lins Podcast.**

The show is a sort of mixbag of audio comedy. Sketches, guests, ramblings, crochet. We'll give it a go if we reckon it'll get a laugh or make a warm jumper. 

We're both Sydney based Redditors and we'd love it if you'd check it out. I am a radio producer by day so rest assure it's good quality audio and not recorded on headsets over Skype (not that there's anything wrong with that).

You can check it out on iTunes [here](http://itunes.apple.com/au/podcast/snitch-and-lins-podcast/id259854977) and the most recent episode on Soundcloud [here.](http://soundcloud.com/snitchknows/the-snitch-and-lins-podcast)

Feel free to direct your feelings of betrayal and disgust to our [Facebook page.

Have a listen and we'll both owe you a coke.

So after 6 months of living here I'm still having trouble meeting people or making friends. I'm a 21 year old male, easy going, and I like to believe I'm outgoing enough to feign courage when talking to strangers, but maybe because of my accent (I'm from California) people assume I'm just another backpacker so they brush me off [which I completely understand] but I sure would like to be able to go out for drinks with someone, actually get to know them, learn about rugby, and have conversations on anything from art and philosophy or video games, books, and cars. 

So I'm here now, taking a chance and putting aside personal pride or fear of what others may think of me (as if anyone here really knows me anyways) to ask any other redditors in Sydney - *want to hang out?*

**Edit/Announcement: I love reddit so much for this kind of thing, thanks everybody for being really fucking cool people. As it so happens some of you are actually keen to hang out tonight, which is amazing.

Now sounds harmless, but this was in quite a busy road and this dumb mother fucker decides to walk as slow as a sloth. 2 lanes each way, And this fool decided to walk back to where he came from thus making him really close to my car. Now this is where it gets interesting. I beeped, hoping for him to see me, this guy gets angry and as i drove passed him, he threw something at my car. Now this was on a busy road, and i wasn't going to keep driving off while this fucker just damaged my property. I stopped immediately and opened the door, the fucker has already been screaming ""get out of the car cunt, what cunt huh what"".. Now i'm never a violent man, but you cant really say that i'm an angel.. I un buckled my seatbelt and took one foot out the car.... But i couldn't leave... I forgot my SO was in the car, she had held me back by holding on to my jacket. I was fuming inside, ready to explode... Then out of nowhere his mate comes and barges in to my door and yells out ""whats your problem huh you fucking cunt, you stay in the car, drive off you fucking cunt""... At this time i snapped out of my rage, i remembered that my gf was in the car. All i could think of was her and what might happen. I stare them off whilst they ran behind my car. I buckle my seatbelt and close my door and console her. This whole thing has been playing in my head the whole day, and it's given me a headache from rage. This all happened in the middle of the day, and i stopped traffic. 

a lot of what ifs in my head, but at the end of the day, im glad my SO is safe. I just wanted to get this all out so i could go to sleep properly.

After settling in to a new routine we are happy to invite new gamers! 

The details:

**WHEN**!? We usually meet the first Saturday of the month

**Where!?** We usually meet in a private home in Ryde but initial meetings are arranged for the Ryde Public Library

**Who!?** Reddit folk (20 somethings)

**Why?** Eat food, play board games &amp; make love (making love is not an option actually - usually it is board game war)

**What Games?** We have been playing: Chaos in the Old World, Game of Thrones, Risk, Settlers of Catan, The Resistance etc. This is not an exclusive list.

**The Initiation Process?** Don't be creepy, rapey, overtly seedy or a douchebag. Also - because we plan games on who attends it is not a good idea to RSVP and not show. This means no more invites for you!

~~Details will be provided upon request and a final date will be set within the week.~~ 
Look like it will be held [here](http://www.ryde.nsw.gov.au/Library/Visit+Us/Ryde+Library) on the 27th of ~~March~~ (time flies) April from 3pm. As mentioned, the library only allows 2 hour bookings. May be relocating to home for those who prefer to stay later (or smaller groups can play at one of the nearby cafes). 
**Where we meet?** 2:45ish at the front entrance to the library. I guarantee you it will be obvious to you!
**what to bring?** Feel free to bring a game or not. Due to time constraints we will be playing shorter games in the library.
**How Many Spaces Are there?** Meeting rooms only allow two groups of 8. There are 10 spaces available at the library meet up. If you prefer to come later PM me directly. 
**ZOMG RSVP?** PM me directly with confirmation &amp; a contact number. We will confirm attendance shortly before event.

Now, I am a student who lives with my parents and once I convinced them Generique was not going to kill us (it took a surprising amount of time) they agreed to having him here.

So, what should I take him out and do? Other students will know that it's exam time at most universities so I have a bit of studying to do but other than that I'm free. Possible meet up? 

He actually is in the country to help people and do 'missions' and stuff, so if you all have any good ideas hit me/him up. Remember the shitty weather at the moment would forbid a lot of outdoorsy stuff. I was going to take him bushwalking but...yeah...

Here's a [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyAfXIRSXIs&amp;feature=plcp) from his Youtube channel to give you more context if you need it.

Look forward to replies and will keep you updated with his/our movements.

**EDIT:** If any Redditors have more free time than me (I am going to try and take him out as much as possible, but have work, study, and my own travel plans to organise!) then shoot me or him a PM and we can maybe sort something out. I would love to organise a meet-up but I am the least organised person in the world.

For the most part (if not all part) the staff and NTEU holding the protest are very professional. They won't impede access, don't harass (or interrupt lectures) and understand that all don't agree with their point.

The arseholes causing all of the problems and pretty much the single reason for such a large police presence back then (and from what I can see each day as I go past now) are the Socialist Alliance in its varying incarnite forms and others looking for a ""cause""

As any uni student knows about this one that the second the word ""Protest"" is mentioned two things happen.

1. Dickhead socialist alliance take some simplistic approach and shout repeatedly despite no one listening.*
2. Dickhead young liberals turn up antagonise them and generally look smug.

Anyway, the shop closed when the servo was knocked down to build a unit block.

(I know it's not saving the kittens, but you know...)",AussieMarketingGuy,40,12,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/sydney/comments/168c9t/anyone_in_sydney_want_some_free_online_marketing/,"So I'm pretty experienced in most bits of online marketing, and I'd be more than happy to help anyone that is after some advice. I've no ulterior motive, other than to help a few people in something that can be a bit of a struggle.  I'm offering an hour (or so) help/advice for free (though a coffee would be nice!) in the areas of...  
* Google Adwords  
* Getting a basic web presence  
* Getting your business listed on the internet, or making sure that people can find your website OK   
* Facebook  
* Setting up analytics on your site so you can see where your traffic comes from
  
I'm really thinking existing businesses rather than ""Oooh I've a good idea"" (Spoiler, 99% of 'genius' online only ideas either require a lot of investment and/or actually don't work out so well for cashflow. Even big companies spend money online). I do this quite a lot, generally for businesses that I come into contact with, so if you or a friend/relative have (for example) a mechanics in Gladesville that doesn't show up in Google, a dog grooming service where they want to spend $50 a month advertising, a cafe in Surrey Hills, a builders, a bakers, candlestickmakers... that's where I can help.  

I can't get you to the #1 position on Google for 'credit cards', but I can help you do a few basics (nothing fancy) to help you show up for when someone searches for ""dry cleaners leichhardt"". I'm not into any get rich quick schemes, and I can't help you build a website, but I can help with an hour or so to point you in the right direction, if it's something you'd like. 

Hopefully this is taken in the spirit its intended, I've used a throwaway as my general account has some random comments on there, and I'm happy to have a chat to people and show I'm a real person before we meet.  In my career (10+yrs) I've worked closely with almost every major online bank and retailer here in Australia.  

Why am I doing this? Well, I like to help people, it frustrates me to see good businesses run by good people who can only get advice by paying $200 an hour for it, and even then they don't know where to get it.  I'm starting a new job in a week or so, and thought I could use the downtime to pass on some experience and also learn a bit more myself.

If you'd like to pass this on, or have any questions, fire away!

**edit** Some basic search engine optimisation advice - make sure you've got content on your home page, that it mentions what you do and there is text on there. The more content you can have that is regularly updated, appeals to visitors and mentions the topic you're interested in selling, the better (within limits!). Here's Google's own advice (there are better sources, there are worse, but I'm going simple and uncontroversial here! http://static.googleusercontent.com/external_content/untrusted_dlcp/www.google.com/en//webmasters/docs/search-engine-optimization-starter-guide.pdf)

The acne I'm ok with because I'm already receiving treatment from my usual doctor which is going well, but the redness was my main reason for seeking a referral - it makes me very self-conscious. So I was given a referral, I call the doctors office and book an appointment, and I'm told the consult fee is $210 - which I think is steep, but I expected this to be a proper discussion with a medical professional who would give me some sound advice, so I agreed to it.

Right from the start I should have known something was up. The reception staff were very unprofessional and inattentive, and the doctor herself was 15 minutes late for the appointment. When she calls me in, she's basically in the middle of her first sentence when I walk in - no joke, she took one look at my face and decided she had made up her mind on my diagnosis. There were no questions about my history or symptoms (aside from the medication I was taking for my acne) and no real discussion of what the problem was - I literally had to interrupt this woman everytime I wanted to speak or give some perspective. Then she tells me she ""wasn't too interested"" in my redness and wanted to focus on my acne - as I said, my acne doesn't bother me too much and wasn't the reason behind me agreeing to pay the $210 consult fee. When I said that, she brushed me off.

Then she decides [Roacutane](http://www.roacutane.org/) is what she needs to prescribe me. I've read about this stuff before - for those who haven't, it's a medication normally reserved for those with severe acne with side affects that can include joint pains and liver damage. It's not something I'm prepared to take for my mild acne. When I told her about my concerns, she again brushed me off. Then, *on top of that*, she tells me I will need to come back in 6 weeks and pay another consult fee to get a prescription. I actually thought she was kidding. When I asked her point-blank whether there was anything I could do to reduce my skin's redness, she said no. Just no.

I left $210 lighter with my face (ironically) red from anger. I paid $210 for what felt like a Roacutane seminar. On top of that, being told nothing can be done about a medical condition that makes me *incredibly* self-conscious was a real kick in the balls on the train home.

From what I can tell, you need a referral to get an appointment at this place - if your doctor gives you one, ask for another. I don't think I'm allowed to mention this woman by name here (can I?), but her name is next to the clinic's name on the building's lobby directory - level 11.

I'm not a history buff. But some historical perspective is nice to have. Otherwise, frankly, the city can be a little staid and boring. New visitors may think that World Square has been there forever (only ≈10 years old). Or that Sydney never had trams (removed). Or that Glebe Point Road has been unchanged for years (huge resurfacing done ≈3 years ago). It's nice to have a local to walk you around, but if you're lonely, by yourself, have some time, have little money, then try a walking tour. Or maybe go on a bicycle for speed. With smartphones etc, some websites or PDFs can be read on the go. This is probably not for the tourist with time pressure; more for the new locals who feels stuck and lonely in an expensive city. 

Sydney Council has printed some self-guided walking tours. You can download, but they used to be freely available at libraries.

Walk through Barangaroo. It used to be a shipping area. It's now open space, and next time it'll be totally different.

We'd need a sound system, and something with an internet connection so we could stream the new album live (unless I'm mistaken I think they're streaming the audio from the Wee Waa show online).

I don't know, I'm really just feeling the need of some cheer)

So it's Christmas. Everyone I know, have family to spend time with this year. I used to spend time with girlfriend and close friends, who don't have an extended family here in Sydney like me. In the past years this has worked fine, but this is the first year I've had to spend Christmas alone, now that all my friends have grown their own families. It's also doubly worse when I had a rough breakup a few months earlier, and now without even a girlfriend to spend time with.

I won't deny it, I'm lonely. It's sounds quite pathetic, but there's something about Christmas that compounds the loneliness I otherwise wouldn't have any other day. Anyway, instead of being pathetic and feeling sorry for myself the rest of the day, can anyone suggest anything I can do to make today, and possibly the next few days a little less depressing?

Looking if anyone else is keen on coming along. :)

-------------------

**UPDATE** 

The current weather forecast for tomorrow makes the Devil's Hole track a little too risky for a group. So I'll be updating to a new location (Wentworth Falls). No need to worry about the train difference, as it will be the same train that goes to Katoomba - you'll just need to get off at Wentworth Falls station instead. Other arrangements are still the same. Anyone with a car should also meet at the station at the time that train arrives. Planning for people should also be the same - water, plan for hot weather, plan for rain, bring food.

This is the final decision.

-------------------

RSVP and additional details are on the Facebook event page: http://www.facebook.com/events/248710688588223/

-------------------

**WALK:**

http://www.wildwalks.com/bushwalking-and-hiking-in-nsw/blue-mountains-wentworth-falls/wentworth-falls-loop.html

Very group-friendly walk. This is a great walk, both in size and spectacular views. The walk makes its way from Wentworth Falls train station and drops off the plateau, passing the cliffs and waterfalls of the National Pass trail. The track passes many falls, with Empress Falls arguably the most stunning. The walk then heads up to Conservation Hut, a great spot for lunch before continuing along the Over- and Undercliff Tracks back to the train station. An excellent walk.

It's 6 hours total but there's several cutoffs if we want to make it a shorter circuit. We can also cut 2 hours off the walk by returning to Leura station instead of Wentworth at the end. Also, the 6 hours is very generous. In reality it will take us less than 5.

-------------------

**THINGS YOU NEED TO BRING:**

- Enough food and water for yourself and one other to last a full day.
- Camera!
- Backpack.
- Insect repellent.

-------------------

**ATTIRE:**

- Wear pants/shorts you don't mind getting dirty.
- Closed in shoes. 
- Warm jacket.

-------------------

**WHEN AND WHERE:**

- December 1st, **9:10am at Wentworth Falls station. Most of us will be on the 9:10 train.** Try not to be late. PM me for contact details. The walk is right next to the station. 

-------------------

**ADDITIONAL INFO:**

- I'll be bringing first Aid/other necessities. 
- If we decide on the more difficult walk, I need to have everyone's contact details in case of an emergency. 
- Stick together at all times. 
- No dying.

I currently have 3 cats. I've recently decided that Olive, the newest member, whilst a lovely catten, needs to be re-homed. She is a cat that needs to be the only cat in the household, as well as being an indoor &amp; outdoor cat. This means my flat with 2 other indoor only cats is not the right environment for her. Plus, 3 cats is just too many (I found Olive out the back of my block of flats about a year ago)

She's a lovely cat, who's extremely affectionate and attentive. She loves cuddles, and she's toilet trained very well. She's out-going, and loves meeting new people. She's almost 1 year old (Birthday in October, roughly)

She's been desexed and microchipped, and I plan on getting her current vaccination done before she moves. I even have worming stuff for her (as I don't have to worm my indoor only cats)

If anyone currently doesn't have a cat, and would like one, let me know. I want Olive to go to a good home, where she'll get the attention and outdoor playing she deserves.

Here are some pictures of the lovely girl. (She's the black one, with yellow eyes)

Early today morning at about 2am near the entrance to the M5 tunnel, a red commodore sped into and collided with my dads taxi. There was another driver working the shift at the time, and this is his account of events plus the two passengers who gave statements as witnesses.

The taxi was completely totalled. The commodore was allegedly badly damaged too, but still drivable. After what was described to us as hesitating for a few seconds, the red commodore sped off without even bothering to see if the driver and passengers were hurt, let alone breathing. The police arrived later and took statements from everyone, and said they informed other stations and highway patrol, but there was nothing they could do.

I understand lots of business face financial ruin, and it happens to others. I'd suck it up, but my dad is devastated as our taxi has only ever had third party insurance, and so that's pretty much his livelihood down the drain. On top of that we rent our home, and my family is under major stress trying to figure out how we can keep going.

At this point the police have pretty much let us know there is nothing they can do. Does anyone have any advice, or any direction on dealing with the matter? Surely the car was caught on camera somewhere in the tunnel or at one of the exits? If anyone has advice I would greatly appreciate it.

Hopefully all who confirmed got my mobile in case you run into any difficulty getting there.

** When: ** Sunday, 5th December. 11am - 4 pm. 


** PLAN B **  If it looks like it is going to rain or be miserable outdoors Sunday, leave everything you were going to bring at home and come to [STRIKE ENTERTAINMENT](http://www.strikebowling.com.au/strike-entertainment-quarter-nsw/map-parking) at FOX Studios for either Bowling, Pool, Laser Skirmish or Pizza and I believe the venue is licensed.

I'm cool as hell and want to drown myself in Aussie people/culture. Also I need to get my Masters. Yes, I know about, and am also posting to Gumtree and flatmate finder. 


I don't want to live with 4 other lone wolves in a boring international student apartment. I'm a great source of entertainment when you need it, but I'm also a wealth of knowledge and American culture (read: party games, costumes, stories, jokes, insights, etc.). I'm keen on sports and adventure. Camping, spectating, the beach, the city, I do it all. Gentleman by day, something else by night. 

And I'm not all just fun and games. I'm a hell of a cook and I keep tidy. I do dishes, housework, projects, I love animals, and I always turn off the light. I'm so in tune with my feminine side and my masculine side that I'd date myself if I had to. I look good and give great advice - on your girl, your guy, your computer, anything. Humility aside (as if it already wasn't), I'd say I'm pretty intelligent. Got a question? Need to know how something works? I'm your man. 

I work hard, play hard, think hard, and sleep soundly. I've thrown off all expectations for the coming year and am as excited as I've ever been to explore the great wonder that is Australia. 

Hit me up if your friend group just lost one to the universe of girlfriendland (or boyfriendland). Or let me know if you and your significant other have an extra room you need rented out. Actually, just message me for whatever reason you can think of. 

Trust me - I'm a keeper. 

Here's a short list of things I'm good at:

&gt; Cooking, cleaning, frisbee, guitar, ukulele, building things, beach activities, academics, computers, video games, drinking games, non-drinking party games, being creative, being intellectual, science, philosophy, waiting tables, working out, telling stories, getting lost, making friends, helping others, winning, and holding hands.

So I was thinking of having a reddit board game afternoon/evening at [Norita cafe](http://www.norita.com.au/). I was thinking of having this in a few Saturday's time, on the 6th of October at 4:00 pm. Norita closes at 2am so we have plenty of time to play. I am a uni student though so I am very flexible with times if the majority of people want it at a different time.

The cafe charges per head per game (per hour?) depending on which game ($2 for Jenga, $4 for Settlers, etc) so it would be great if we could bring a bunch of games ourselves and save some money.
I can bring Settlers of Catan with Knights and Cities expansion, Ticket to Ride Europe and Balderdash.

If you are serious about coming, please comment that you are coming, and what board games you can bring. This will only go ahead if there is enough interest so if you reply, please make plans to actually come!

You guys are great, thanks for being so enthusiastic about this! I would like to set up a more local event around Strathfield, so if you would be keen for this please mention it to me.",,False,self,t5_2qkob,1345786832.0,,,True,t3_yqnrw,http://www.reddit.com/r/sydney/comments/yqnrw/update_looking_for_board_game_buddies/,

I'm a guy in my early twenties who's soon to be moving to Sydney from Canada. I really couldn't be more excited about it and while there will be many challenges (such as socially, looking for a job, place to live etc) the only point that actually bothers me is thinking of the spiders. I'm easy going and not too much bothers me, but boy do I blow when it comes to dealing with spiders.

People always seem to love discussing the freaky/dangerous/ubiquitous wildlife in Australia, (watching BBC nature documentaries probably hasn't helped) but I'd like to know from locals what it's really like. Do you see giant spiders on a daily basis? Do you encounter them frequently in your home? Are these spiders potentially harmful? Any response would be appreciated, but someone who has arachnophobia themselves might be of extra help. 

Spiders aside, I cannot wait to move to Australia, thanks a million!!

Thursday night (Jan 24): Two FA/18 Hornets will be undertaking circuit training (including 'touch and go' exercises) at RAAF Richmond from 7:30pm until 9:00pm.  No aerobatics happening, but it's rare to get Hornets in the Sydney area since they're based at Williamstown.  I checked this out last year too and it gets really loud, so be warned (you may want to consider ear protection, particularly if you're under the final approach).

Also, the training depends on the weather.  If it looks dicey, keep an eye on the RAAF Facebook page but don't necessarily rely on it to advise if training has been cancelled.  A few people got caught out last year.

Australia Day: 1:30pm 3 RAAF Hawk LIF jets will be doing a flyby over Sydney Harbour (they were meant to be Hornets sadly; this appears to have been changed).  No indication of any aerobatics but the fast jets have put on flying displays in recent years,

I need girl friends. Sure, yes, I have internet girl friends but they all live on other continents, and those are tricky to get to. I want someone to watch girly movies with, to go shopping with, to go out dancing with on Friday nights. I have a boyfriend and a small close group of friends (all of whom I met on the internet) but my boyfriend works nights and my friends all prefer a night in with their computer than a night out with flesh and blood people. That used to be fine with me but I'm 26 and now I feel like I haven't done anything fun or crazy and Friday nights alone make me feel achingly sad.

My problem is that I'm also terrified of other ladies. After growing up being severely bullied, I pretty much think that all other ladies are quietly judging me and even when someone says something nice, they must mean it mockingly. Also, the majority of ladies I've met (like my ex housemates) enjoy gossiping about stupid things like Jersey Shore and True Blood and don't understand when I use sarcasm or make a joke that maybe refers to Doctor Who or something internetty. (No harm to ladies who like Snooki or Sookie, but when they're the only things a person talks about of course it's going become tiring.)
 
It would be great to meet up with other ladies who perhaps feel similar. We could take it slow. Get a Facebook group. Go out for a drink and sit in terrified silence with our desperate cases of bitchface. I'd really like to try.

EDIT: Hooray! A response! I have started a Facebook group called r/sydney lady pals.

He was obviously watching the entrance closely and when I looked out he ducked behind the cars and began to walk off. 

Looked similarly dodgy as the last guy I caught - new looking joggers, backpack too (handy for stashing the stolen mailbox contents, holding the set of letterbox keys). 

I had asked /r/Sydney for solutions - [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/sydney/comments/xx6zz/anyone_else_getting_their_letter_box_contents/) - but I guess springing the guy might have worked.

Walked across the road and he was watching me closely still while walking away. I stopped. He did the old ""What are you watching me for?"" (when he's the one drawing attention to himself for intensely watching me).

I asked what his obvious interest in my building (and now me) was. 

Conversation continued - I said there had been thefts from the mailboxes which was why I noticed his watching the entrance - I snapped [a picture of him](http://i.imgur.com/AePO9.jpg) as I walked up (lesson learned from last time - don't wait 'til they're sprung and running away if you want a good picture.. get them while their guard is down).

He started on the ""well, let's talk to the police"" bluff - which he tried to tell me meant going to ""the police station on eddy avenue"". Don't think I've ever seen one on eddy avenue, but I'd imagine one or more of his mates would be there. 

Anyhow, went to snap another picture and he lunged and pushed me in the face because ""I didn't give you permission to take my picture"" (assault?). I said I can legally take any pictures I wand in a public place. Too late buddy, already got your picture. 

Then he put on his best ""Shit, got caught - better walk briskly away"" like the other guy did. Called the cops while following a bit behind - they said as they couldn't get there quickly that it would be best not to follow as it might be into an ambush (which, thinking about the eddy avenue police station bullshit - was likely). 

tl;dr: Guy was watching my building entrance from across the road. Confronted. Got a snap of him.

Try to keep submissions pertinent to the *City of Sydney* and not your local suburbs e.t.c. to keep it as relevant as possible to the widest audience.

* Major transport hubs are centered around Wynard (Train station, Northbound bus services mostly orignate from here), Town Hall (Major Train interchange with a bus terminal alongside the QVB. Central Station is where most city rail lines pass through and many more originate. Come here for interstate in intercountry services as well)

* If you need a nice bathroom/toilet to take care of business most hotel lobbies have nice bathrooms which anyone can access providing you can keep a straight face as you walk through. The Swisshotel on Market St. is one I've used on occasion without any problems and is quite centrally located.

* Hyde park is pretty much the Sydney equivalent of New York's Central Park and while large, is quite populated 24/7 and as such if your looking for a bit of privacy to do whatever you may be better off looking elswhere.

* Major shopping districts are located around the Pitt St. mall area as well as inside the Queen Victoria Building and also the World Square, China Town and Paddy's Market Area's.

* Darling Harbour is a nice area but has always been a white elephant and is nowadays a shadow of its former self. Come here for some nice food with a view but thats about it.

* Barely anyone uses the monorail for effective transit due to outrageuos prices but its pretty fun.

* If your heading to the Northern Beaches via Public Transport the L90 Sydney Bus service goes all the way from the CBD up to palm beach and stops at most major bus stops from Warringah Mall outbound.

If someone could address the major nightlife venues around sydney city without bias that would be great, I'll add your content to the main post and credit you so we can turn it into a superguide.





**Inputs from replies** (I'll finish up these later, brb transformers 3)

From *Im-post-able*

&gt;Explore - Some of the coolest things in Sydney CBD are found by walking off the beaten path. There are plenty of food courts and eateries that are hidden away and are orders of magnitude better than the ""main"" food courts.

&gt;Driving - If you're driving to a location on the other side of the city, AVOID it at all costs, there are plenty of express ways and detours around the city that save HEAPS of time.

&gt;The Lord Nelson Pub - If you like beer and food.. go there.

&gt;Harts Pub - If you like beer and food more than people who go to the Lord Nelson.. go to Harts pub. Epic microbrews and gorgeous food (try the burgers)
