To the mom who's breastfeeding: Way to go! It really is an amazing gift to give your baby, for any amount of time that you can manage! You're a good mom. 

To the mom who's formula feeding: Isn't science amazing? To think there was a time when a baby with a mother who couldn't produce enough would suffer, but now? Better living through chemistry! You're a good mom. 

To the cloth diapering mom: Fluffy bums are the cutest, and so friendly on the bank account. You're a good mom. 

To the disposable diapering mom: Damn those things hold a lot, and it's excellent to not worry about leakage and laundry! You're a good mom. 

To the mom who stays home: I can imagine it isn't easy doing what you do, but to spend those precious years with your babies must be amazing. You're a good mom. 

To the mom who works: It's wonderful that you're sticking to your career, you're a positive role model for your children in so many ways, it's fantastic. You're a good mom. 

To the mom who had to feed her kids from the drive thru all week because you're too worn out to cook or go grocery shopping: You're feeding your kids, and hey, I bet they aren't complaining! Sometimes sanity can indeed be found in a red box with a big yellow M on it. You're a good mom. 

To the mom who gave her kids a homecooked breakfast lunch and dinner for the past week: Excellent! Good nutrition is important, and they're learning to enjoy healthy foods at an early age, a boon for the rest of their lives. You're a good mom. 

To the mom with the kids who are sitting quietly and using their manners in the fancy restaurant: Kudos, it takes a lot to maintain order with children in a place where they can't run around. You're a good mom. 

To the mom with the toddler having a meltdown in the cereal aisle: they always seem to pick the most embarrassing places to lose their minds don't they? We've all been through it. You're a good mom.

It feels right. I follow my instincts. I love having her snuggled next to me. I never worry if she's breathing, I can put my hand on her little tummy and feel the rise and fall. I don't have to get up to nurse, and at this point she can pretty much do everything herself, barely wakes me up. And tonight as she lay next to me nursing, I held her little hand, feeling the smooth skin and tiny fingers. This is my daughter. I made her. She came from me. I love her more than life itself and I'm going to cherish these moments. She won't be a baby forever. Someday she will be in her own room. Someday she won't live in my house. Someday she may be cuddled next to her little one. And I will miss her, but I will be proud of her. But tonight she is all mine, and I'm so thankful I am her world. 


Mommies, please don't be afraid. I see a lot of uncertainty and fear here. This is a safe place to voice those fears, but always remember YOU know your babies best. Don't be afraid to stand up for yourself and your sweet babe. Don't be afraid to follow your instincts. Don't be afraid to be a mother. You are doing an amazing job.

I want to share something that's been on my mind lately. I've been feeling a little sorry for myself, a little sad because I don't have the perky breasts that I used to. I'm not skinny any more. I look older. I feel older.
I realized today that the image I have in my mind is that bright-haired, energetic 18 year old of 8 years ago.  That's not me though.

18 year old me, she had boobs that bounced. She had hair that flowed, skin that was firm and soft.

That's not who I am. 

I am not lithe. My body is comfy. It's warm and soft, with little pillows for my baby to lay her head. there are more pillows than I thought I'd have but that's good. All the more squish for my girl to cuddle with.

There are wrinkles on it, for my baby to trace with her little fingers.
My hands are rough and strong.
These are all good things.

This is not an admonishment or a call to just accept everything about yourself. If you want to improve your body, by all means! But don't imagine that you will look like that young little high schooler flitting around your memories. You have a mother's body, and adult body, and it deserves to be loved for how it is.

I was giving Ainslie her nightly bath and winding down from the day with her. She loves being in her tub and just relaxing in the warm water. I only ever fill her little tub up with an inch or two of water, but that was enough for her to drown in. I had my head on the edge of the tub, just smiling at her and cooing back to her when she quickly turned half of her face into the water.

She put her face in the water and pulled it back out more quickly than I could react. Her mouth was closed the whole time and for a split second I thought she was okay. She must have breathed in the water through her nose because within seconds she turned red and started flailing her arms and legs.

Luckily, the playgroup I go to has a guest speaker come in once a month and January's guest speaker did an information session on baby choking. I picked her up right away, laid her body face down on my forearm and began doing back blows. In about 10 seconds, she spit out the water and started to cry. From the moment she inhaled the water to when she spit it out, only about 45 seconds had passed. It was honestly the scariest 45 seconds of my life.

I cried so hard and held her extra close for the rest of the night. I can't even tell you how many times I checked on her while she was sleeping last night. If I hadn't been right there, I could have lost my baby to something that happened in a split second.

Remember to always bring everything you need into the bathroom with you. Once the baby is in the bath, it doesn't matter if you forgot their towel, you don't leave them to go get it. Your shirt will dry, but you can't bring your baby back if the worst were to happen. The phone and the doorbell are also not important when your baby is in the bath, that person can wait. I hope none of you ever have to experience what I did last night.",,False,,t5_2u06v,False,,GIRL,True,t3_18731p,http://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/18731p/this_may_come_off_as_a_little_psay/,

It's not the sleepless nights. It's not the migraine headaches from hormones and sleep deprivation and a tiny human screaming in my face.

It's the damn Mommy-shaming.

Both online and in person, I have caught shit for almost every decision I've made in the last 3.5 months.

""Why are you formula feeding? You're horrible.""

""Your kid has a weird name.""

""Why is she wearing blue? You know she's a GIRL, right? Between the clothes and her weird name, you're going to turn her into a lesbian.""

""Why are you starting solids before 6 months? Why haven't you already started solids?""

""I can't believe you put in her in daycare already! How could you let her spend the weekend with your parents?! She's too young!""

God damn it people. Step the fuck off. Just back up and step off. I am doing the best I fucking can. My kid has a safe, comfortable, stable home. She has two parents who love her more than anything, and a cadre of relatives who feel the same. She wants for NOTHING.

I would lay down my life for this child. In a heartbeat. I would let you cut off each of my toes with a sharpened spoon if it meant she would never have to know loss, or sadness, or heartbreak. 

I am a fucking good mother.

Now leave me alone to do my goddamned job. 

I have baby sheets to fold.

So, this morning, she opens the cabinet where the bulb is now stored, found it, took it out, and exclaimed ""nose!"" and tried to shove it in her nose.

I.e. at 10 months, she was tortured by a nose bulb, and 7 months later, she saw it, knew what it was for, named the appropriate body part and attempted to use it on herself.

While I am having a super easy time breastfeeding I know it is a struggle for a lot of women, and for those of you who have those struggles I just want you to know, it is ok to formula feed.... Just feed your children. 

I just felt like this needed to be said, since I see a lot of comments saying "" I had to formula feed, and I feel guilty"", don't. Just don't. You are feeding your child, sure it is not breastmilk, but it is food, and it is nutrition, and doctors and nutritionists are doing their best to make sure it is as much like breastmilk as it can be.

This summer was my last semester at school, and I should have been graduating Saturday, August 3rd. 

Well, My baby was due July 28th so the chance of me walking at graduation was slim to none. 
My baby came early on July 7th. :] He was completely healthy :]

and I am proud to say that after 4 years, starting in August of 2009, (After having my first child on July 28, 2009) and going through raising a 4 year old, the death of an aunt from cancer, the death of my uncle and my mother from suicide just a few months apart, and all kinds of personal problems, that on August 3rd, 2013, I walked across that stage and achieved my Bachelor of Arts in History :]

When I started, I honestly never thought that I would finish, especially when I found out i was pregnant in November. I still hauled my pregnant butt to class all through the spring semester and somehow managed to attend class all through June. 


Here is a [picture](http://imgur.com/snJTw4Q) of me and my four year old. and here is a [picture](http://imgur.com/WYoZwnm) of me and my newborn :]

About 4 days ago, some kind of baby magic happened at our house (we're right around the 10-week mark currently) and the screaming just stopped all of a sudden one morning. 

I have never seen a happier baby in my life than my son has been the last few days: he suddenly discovered cooing and babbling and just smiles at me all day long. He's even been going down for naps in his swing awake without a sound (WHAT? WHO IS THIS BABY!?). We haven't mastered the putting-down-awake-in-crib-at-night yet, but we'll get there. The only times he's cried in the past few days have been because he needed to burp (he's so difficult to burp still and just hates it and panics every time, but I know this will pass with time) and during his evening fussy time around 6:00, which is easy to deal with because it's predictable. 

I just wanted to give a happy update because I've read a few posts in the last week or so from people with babies about my son's age expressing similar exasperation and I just wanted to share a ""Holy wow, it really did get better all of a sudden"" story to provide a little hopefulness for those who are as miserable as I was a week ago. People kept saying it would get better, but I had a hard time really believing it when 80%+ of my day was filled with crying. I'm sure there will be rough patches ahead, but it's just such a huge difference that even though he was up 6 times last night, I don't even care. I don't dread waking up and facing the day with him anymore, and it's only been 5 days since I did.",,False,,t5_2u06v,1365613575.0,,,True,t3_1c2nel,http://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/1c2nel/i_think_ive_reached_my_breaking_point_update_wow/,

While we are always (usually?) happy for these ladies, those of us who aren't so lucky or diligent feel kind of deflated. I wanted to bring to the table a bit of a different experience. My son is 6 months old and today I put on my first pair of pants with buttons and a zipper. Yes, I'm here to confess that until today if I was wearing pants they were either yoga pants (not so bad) or my maternity jeans (wtf body, just wtf?) 

With my daughter I was able to get into a normalish size soon after, though nowhere near my pre-pregnancy weight. In fact, I never reached that. I gained 60 pounds with her pregnancy and lost all but the last 15. Then over the years hormonal issues and treatments (depo-lupron to be exact) along with other medications caused weight to slowly creep back on. With my son I gained 30 pounds and am fighting to drop the last 15. I breastfed for nearly 6 months and could not shed a SINGLE solitary pound. IN FACT, I gained 5 pounds while breastfeeding (and this was eating insanely well!) Since stopping the breastfeeding I've been able to find a diet that works with my body and ever so slowly I'm seeing little bits of ""normal"" again.

Don't lose hope. Not everyone recovers overnight, in a month or two, or even in a few years, and that is okay. I'll probably be still fighting with weight in another 6 months. Give yourself permission to love your body. You're so fantastically crafty you made a person. Celebrate that no matter what you look like. Take pictures with your baby where your chin has its own chin because you're smooshing those cheeks with kisses. Take the awkward video where your arm looks bigger than your baby and you can absolutely see your tummy. Even if you don't like how you look now, you might and probably will eventually look different, and if nothing else you can look back and say ""look how far I've come!"" And if you don't ever change, at least you won't kick yourself ten years from now for not having captured these wonderful memories.

I'll stop being sappy now. I just wanted to share my happiness and a dose of encouragement with you all. Thank you for all the awesome stories and pictures you post! Keep the smiles coming :)

I woke up at 6:45 this morning to a baby happily babbling on the monitor.  I reach over for my phone and look at his sleep app and am surprised to see that he has slept for 8 hours and 40 minutes straight.

I stumble into the nursery and both my breasts are engorged and slightly leaky.  I walk over to my baby and he is on his back grinning and he begins kicking his arms and legs because he is so happy to see me.

I pick him up and take him over to the mattress in the corner of his room.  He nurses vigorously and drains my breast in about 5 minutes.  We stop only once to burp, then he quickly finishes the other half of his breakfast.

We go down the hall back to the master bedroom for cuddles with daddy.  Then to the living room, where he goes into the pack n play and entertains himself while I make coffee and breakfast for myself and my husband in a clean kitchen.

She can walk pretty well. Her Daddy and I took her to the shopping mall and we bought some Snoopy pyjamas, a little plastic hand basket (with the hope that she will stop dragging my handbag around the house) and took her to have lunch. Mostly we carried her but I let her walk for a little bit. She was carrying her little basket in her left hand and holding my hand with her right. She tried to talk to a store maniquin and got a little pissed when it didn't respond to her affections. I walked maybe 3 steps away from her and called her name. She looked panicked at being alone and ran towards me and took my hand. 

It's not much but it's the first real, conscious choice she's made to take my hand. Normally I must take her hand but in the busy mall she chose to come to the safety of Mummy and it gave me a warm fuzzy feeling. Even her rough, tough and hard to bluff Daddy looked like he got a fuzzy from his little girl walking like a big girl :)

Nap? ""Nah, thanks, I'm super crabby, but I'm busy stuffing my hands in my mouth."" 

Toys? ""No thanks. HANDS!""

 Good night? ""Hey, sorry guys, I woke myself up half a dozen times because I HAVE HANDS!"" 

I have temporarily resorted to bringing back the swaddle for my own sanity. Is this a bad idea that will prolong his adjustment to the world of hands?  Would I be better of just letting him have them and sucking up the lack of sleep/crabbiness for a while?  I've had to bounce a super crabby, overtired baby to sleep for over an hour a few times this week because he just WILL NOT QUIT with the hands. 

Cradle hold? HAH, HANDS. 

Tummy down? WELL THAT'S CONVENIENT. THERE ARE MY HANDS.

Over the shoulder? HAHA YOU CAN'T SEE ME WITH MY HANDS.

Swaddle? LET ME WIGGLE AROUND AND GRUNT UNTIL HANDS.

In conclusion,
I am so over hands.


P.S. I love you baby, but your hands STINK. Bad.

And the complete center of my life. Sometimes, I just want to take her and hide so I can (selfishly) have every minute with her. 
I have a 15yo stepdaughter. We have her every single day she doesn't have school. So every weekend, every Easter, all summer, every Christmas, March break etc. It's been like this as long as I've been involved. I don't get it, but whatever!
I love her. She's a great kid. Way better than the typical 15yo. The 'problem' is that when she's with us, she's stuck to me like glue. I can't even count the number of times in an average weekend I step on her foot or elbow her in the boob because she's so close. She follows me when I change the baby, when I give her a bath. She talks to me while I try to play with the baby. And once the baby is asleep, she's really stuck to me. She saves shows for me to watch so we can see them together. She wants to talk about her week at school. She wants to go anywhere I go. Etc. 
So, sometimes, after a challenging week, I've found myself dreading the weekend. My SO is home as well. They all want my attention. They all make more mess. And I'm tired. However, I always really make an effort. I don't want my stepdaughter to resent her sister. I do love her. And I feel like as a parent, I just need to suck it up and deal. 
Yesterday, I woke up thinking it was thursday and was so disappointed to realize the weekend had arrived already. I made my stepdaughters favorite meal (I usually do once a month or so) and waited for her to come home from school. 
While we were eating, she was babbling on about things she likes and doesn't. I was able to guess most of her likes/dislikes. She looked at me and said 'I'm so glad you and Dad got together. You are the best listener. You know me better than anyone else. Even my mom doesn't remember all the things you do about me'. 
It was so heartfelt and genuine. It reminded me how lucky I am that she takes my attention for good things. That she could be snotty or rude, but instead, she's loving and sweet. That I could be arguing with her instead of chatting about her day. It reminded me that my daughter will have a wonderful role model in her older sibling.

I would really pay out of the nose for a pacifier that would calm my baby down the way my boob does. Maybe throw some expressed breastmilk in that bitch so I can actually get some sleep. 

Maybe if we tell perverts that they can buy two and titty-bang them manufacturers would get on this faster.

She's 9 months old, first of all, and will be interested in whatever her older brother last touched (or is currently touching). Second, what does that even mean? 

I'm not even really bothered by it, more just stunned. I can't believe in this day and age that I just heard that uttered about my 9 month old. Poor little Peanut, with nothing to occupy herself but tractor trailers, matchbox cars, and legos. Does she have girly things? Sure, some moronic family member got her a dumb toy set that included pretend make-up, a giant diamond ring, a mirror, and a purse. Yes, that's what I want to start my daughter out on.

Thank you for sending me this!
Really appreciated and  am amazed how quickly our little man is growing up! You and and [mrNervousPreggo] have been doing a superb job at parenting, I am so proud of you both! The dinner you cooked for me the night of my arrival was so memorable and I really could have eaten the whole pan! :)
You are a wonderful woman and perfect daughter in law and mum to my little grandson. Thank you for being a blessing in my life, [NervousPreggo]!


She'd just visited us for a few days (and helped out loads) and I'd sent her some pictures. We're both really different people: she's American, extroverted always wears make up and dresses nicely. I'm English, kind of shy and sometimes awkward, a bit of a geek (like my husband),  and usually scruffy. It would be really easy for her to wish for a DIL more like her but she's just happy me and husband and the LO are happy. Reading some of the shit some of you guys have to put up with really blows my mind and makes me feel so lucky!!!

After checking the usual things, I concluded that all I could do was let him cry while I got ready for bed, and hope he worked up an appetite enough to feed then let that relax him long enough to fall asleep. 

So I lie down and I'm feeding him when I notice he's finally calm. We make eye contact and he smiles. I'm delighted that he is happy again and I smile back and lay my hand on his cheek. Straight away, he lifted his hand to rest firmly on mine. No hesitation, with enough pressure to make it feel deliberate.

* enjoy the immobility. my little guy started rolling both ways very early and doing a bunch of other stuff, but then went through a long phase of nothing new. once he hit 8 months he went from from immobile to crawling to cruising furniture in a week flat. it's exhausting

* trouble will sneak up and ambush you in a gang. your baby can experience 9 month sleep regression, an allergy ring, getting 4 upper teeth at once, all while having croup over the Christmas holiday

* no matter what time of night it is or how sleep deprived I get, I don't get tired of watching him sleep peacefully


* cliche I know, but it really does go by so damned fast and I know I will miss him being a baby


* it may be ""hard"" sometimes but I am one of the lucky ones. my baby is healthy, and loved. we have resources to care for him and he has excellent prospects in life

It has been difficult sometimes but it has been a good year. This is the best, and sometimes the worst thing that has ever happened to me. I ooze empathy now and that's hard for someone who was formerly as self contained as I was. I love the baby boy and do not wish to imagine a world in which he does not exist. I'm enjoying the present and looking forward with some trepidation to his future. It is hard being a mommy, and I know I'm one of the lucky ones. The world is just so much more fraught now.

My husband is a saint.  Okay, not quite, but still.

I had a 12 month maternity leave, and just went back to work last week.  My husband is a stay at home dad.  Our little guy is just under 11 months now.

I had a nasty difficult labor and an emergency C-section.  My husband stepped up on baby's very first day, and said: ""Show me how to change his diaper.  That's going to be my job.""  He's changed 80% or more of the diapers.  He says that since he can't do the input (I'm breastfeeding), he'll do the output.  

Our baby was seriously fussy, due to undiagnosed allergies.  Basically, he screamed constantly for the first four months.  Hubby spent hours and hours walking his screaming son up and down the hall at all hours of the day and night.  He would send me to bed with earplugs, and just walk.  He would let me sleep until baby needed feeding, then would send me back to bed.  When we figured out that I had to cut dairy, beef, gluten, nuts, soy, and coconut from my diet, he quit eating those things in solidarity.  He learned how to cook things I could eat.  He spent hours reading labels in grocery stores with me to figure out what might be okay.  He let me whine endlessly about how tough it was to not have milk chocolate.  

Now that I'm back to work, Hubby does all of the feeding, soothing, diapering, nap-inducing, and supervising of our son while I'm gone, and 50% (or more) of all of the above when I'm home.  He gets out of bed as soon as the baby cries, and takes him to a different room to soothe him back to sleep, unless he's hungry.  If baby needs to eat, Hubby brings him to me to nurse (I barely wake up), then takes him back to his crib.  

The one thing I do 100% of is baths.  Oh, and generally most or all of the shopping (for clothes and other baby stuff; Hubby usually helps with grocery shopping).  Everything else is shared duty, often with him doing more than his share.  He's actually designated days for me to play Skyrim or Civ all day, except when baby needs to eat.  On a day-to-day basis, my husband sneaks in his video game time during naps, but not normally until after he's done the dishes, cleaned the kitchen, run a load of laundry, and figured out what will be for supper.  The house is not immaculate or anything, but it's pretty damn good considering baby's not a year old yet and I work full-time-plus.  

Oh, yeah, and we live on a farm and have livestock, and Hubby's been doing all of the chores this week because I've been sick with a cold.  Normally, he does mornings and I do evenings.  

Great husbands / daddies are out there.  I don't think they're as common as the lazy slobs, but they definitely exist.  I am incredibly grateful to mine for doing so much, without having to be asked.  Just wanted to put that other perspective out there.

TL; DR:  Been seeing a lot of posts about bad husbands / daddies.  Wanted to share that there are good ones out there, and describe what that looks like.",,False,,t5_2u06v,False,,BOY,True,t3_1drhuj,http://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/1drhuj/how_i_think_it_ought_to_be/,

I just need to know it gets better.

I feel like all I do is feed him. Constantly. He latches great and is clearly getting enough if his diapers are any indication. But I feel like it's literally my sole purpose in life. To provide boob. It's infinitely more exhuasting/draining/demanding/boring than I ever imagined. 

Sleep? What's that? This kid is nocturnal. My pediatrician claims we can get him on a schedule, but this child does whatever he wants. It feels silly and futile to try to wake him up and keep him up. He just ends up eating and passing out again. As I said, he's the dictator.

1361430890.0,57,self.beyondthebump,18xy7h,Husband seems to hate me since getting pregnant and having a baby... anyone else experience this?,rocknturd,71,14,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/18xy7h/husband_seems_to_hate_me_since_getting_pregnant/,"Ok, throwaway time. And sorry in advance for the long pity party post.

Let me start by saying that my husband loves our son and tries to be a good dad. Now...

I feel like my husband hates me, or at the very least has resented me since the day I got pregnant with our now 3 month old son. The pregnancy was not unplanned, as he had been asking for years to start a family and I had finally come around. But ever since the moment I told him I was expecting his attitude towards me changed. He started avoiding me and spending all of his time with his friend. He even told me that he wasn't sure that he wanted to be the same person I married... that he wanted to take some time to decide who he was. Then a week before our son was born he magically changed his mind and turned into a supportive and excited father to be. Ok...

Things were great between us at the hospital, but as soon as we got home things declined. He expected me to be back at 100% within the week, and when I wasn't he started becoming more and more agitated. He even told me that I handled labor poorly and was trying to milk my recovery. Ass. He has accused me of ""trying to kill our son"" several times (once because I put him in the crib with a pacifier and once because I poured water over baby's face in the bath, among other minor offenses). He also decreed that he should not (and would not) get up with the baby during the night (I ebf so he would have just been changing diapers anyways) because he was the only one who worked and needed his sleep. Ok, I can see that I guess... so I've been the only one to get up during the night ever since our second night home. Anytime I ever speak of being tired he says things like ""I don't know why, it's not like you do anything but sit around and eat all day."" He tells me all the time that he feels like it is my job to take care of our son and all of the household chores because I don't work during the day and 'it's not that hard to watch a baby and get stuff done at the same time.' He grills me about what chores I did during the day, and when I haven't been productive enough he gets irritated. When he comes home he plays with the baby a little, talks at me about his day at work (not really to me, as he doesn't give me a chance to respond) for about an hour, showers, eats, then naps on the couch until bed. He will change diapers but refuses to feed the baby when I pump and put the bm in a bottle (saying that I need to be the one to feed him at home so we can save everything I pump for when we go out), or do things like bathe the baby. He frequently tells our son that his mommy is crazy and needs happy pills (along with other less than kind things), and when we get mad at each other he usually tries to take the baby from me. Not in a violent way or anything, he'll usually just follow me around demanding to have ""his son"" until I hand him to him. He's also made it a point to tell me that if I divorce him I would never get rid of him because he wont leave me alone until he has his son. I haven't even spoken of divorce since he brought it up when I was pregnant, so this always catches me off guard. 

He also reminds me almost daily that we are pathetically broke because we live on one income. He spends all of his spare time either with his friend or window shopping for motorcycles/parts online, and lecturing me about how he should be able to buy nice things. He also compares us to our friends who have more stuff than us... always talking about how it must be nice to have 2 incomes and be able to afford the things to make you happy. Allow me to add that since we've been together he's purchased a new truck and 2 motorcycles. I, on the other hand, am still driving the same car I had 13 years ago (with no complaint until now... a 2 door 96 toyota is a bit small for a family car). I would also like to say that while we don't have a lot of extra cash, we are always able to cover our living expenses just fine.

In addition to this he also seems to hate sharing with me. I only work 5 hours a week from home right now because I have had trouble finding a job that will pay for childcare and gas with any money left over, so I really don't have any of my own money. He usually gives me between $40-60 to cover food for the house and gas for my car for the week, plus any other expenses I may have. Occasionally he will only give me $20, saying that he has to make sure the bills are paid before he can just give me money. Yes, I have had to learn to be VERY good at stretching a dollar. I've cut out almost all driving -- only leaving the house to go to the store or to appointments. I only shop at discount food stores. I haven't bought clothes since before I got pregnant (at 30lbs heavier than I used to be I'm literally stuffing myself into my old clothes), I've stopped wearing make up since I can't afford to replace it, and I never ask him to give me money for anything recreational. I even turned down going on vacation with my family because he didn't think it was fair that I would use my meager earnings on just myself. Yet anytime I ask him for grocery money he lectures me about how he can't afford to give me money, always reminding me the HE is the only one who is earning income. And he repeatedly brings up that I'm at home all day long and therefore must be eating up all the food all day.

There are other things too -- like that we haven't slept together since before I had the baby (maybe tmi?). He's really grabby and will slap my ass or throw me down on the bed during the day, but when it comes down to it he told me he'd rather sleep, and if I really wanted anything I'd get up at 4am and get it before he goes to work. Yeah, right. I've just been up all night with the baby, but sure honey! He also told me last weekend that ""I know frank will always be my friend, but you may not always be my wife. That's why I'm trying to make him a priority."" Wtf? Shouldn't that be the other way around? Then tonight he said (not for the first time) that if it weren't for me he could make the week's worth of food that I buy stretch for a month. I know I'm a little heavier than I was, but geez. For the record, I don't eat all day. I have a bowl of cereal for breakfast, and usually fruit and a handful of peanuts for lunch, then whatever I make us for dinner. Sometimes I splurge and eat late night bowl of cereal, but that's it.

I just don't know what to do. I'm not sure what I've done to make him think I'm such a lazy, sloppy, pig. I try to keep a clean house, do his laundry, cook dinner every night, and take good care of our son. I have tried to express that I think it would be more cost effective for me to be a stay at home mom for now, and that I want to take care of our baby, not have someone else do it. I don't think it makes me lazy or a bad person that I want to be with my baby, but I just can't get my husband to understand. I'm so tired of constantly being reminded of how much I suck, and how I'm apparently dragging him down. He makes me feel like a mooch just for occupying space in this house. I've got no real job and no savings... I'm dependent on him for everything. I feel like I'm constantly verbally beaten up. I swear he hates me... he's the same old nice guy in front of our friends, but when it comes to me it's another story. I try not to let it get to me, but it does. 

Not sure what I'm expecting anyone to do or say... I just needed to get it off my chest. Hopefully I can gain some perspective from this. Anyone else experience something like this? Will it get better? Am I just not seeing what I'm doing wrong?

tl;dr My husband used to like me, now he just likes to blame me.

Her heart looks NOTHING like a normal heart and her heart murmur is so prominent you can feel it through her chest. She should have had surgery in the hours or days following birth. As her body has coped these three months, her heart has become enlarged and she has fluid in her lungs. 

Truncus Arteriosus. A normal heart has two arteries; the aorta which brings blood from the heart to the body, and the pulmonary, which brings blood from the heart to the lungs. In this congenital defect, there is only one artery attached to the heart, the aorta, and there are two pulmonary branches stemming from the aorta, giving it the appearance of a tree. In addition to this, my daughter's bottom ventricles or chambers are not connected, which causes a large hole. 

This is congenital. So at the moment her heart started developing, this was happening. What is the point of an anatomy scan if not to check the appearance of the vital organs? I'm at the top pediatric hospital in the state which is also the top for cardiac, the ER had never seen this come through because it is something that is ALWAYS caught before or immediately following birth. They can't believe the ultrasound tech didn't spot it at the 20 weeks scan, it should have been glaringly obvious.

My baby will have open heart surgery this week. She will have a scar for the rest of her life. I can't even think about the risk of the surgery because she just HAS to make it. I'm scared, I'm sad, and I'm mad as hell.

I changed her out of her sleeper, one of the few that fit her in both length, width and feet, a pink owl footie that is in heavy rotation on account of it's miraculous fit. I put her in a new sleeper, an act of optimism that she would head back to sleep after the stimulation of being hosed off and mama's bleak cries of ""holy shit, that's a lot of shit!"" 

Now unfortunately this new sleeper fits her for length, but is a little baggy around the middle and huge in the feet. Now my little lady has a tendency to pull her feet up and if there is enough room, get them caught in the body of the sleeper, which is, admittedly, hilarious to watch, but frustrating for the baby and has led to distress calls being piped throughout the house as she rolls around with her feet trapped. 

I used to solve this by putting a pair of socks on over the feet of the sleeper, it kept everything in place, but was bulky and the feet had the potential to bunch up in the socks in uncomfortable ways despite best intentions to create a smooth layer of footie jammie inside the sock. 

Queue the sleep-deprived Macgyvering that has brought me here to share with you ladies - I cut the ankle bands off a pair of socks that no longer fit the length of her foot and slipped the bands up over her feet around the ankles to hold the sleeper feet in place - no bulk, no extra layers, no trapped feet. 

Now maybe I am a.) just a total idiot for not figuring something like this out earlier and b.) thinking it's worth sharing or c.) it's 5am and fuck if I know what I am doing and I will look at her sad little ankle bands at a more civilized hour and wonder what the hell I was thinking.

So we did a pretty gentle version of cry it out (only letting her fuss and cry a little for a maximum of 5 minutes, if she was screaming we just went in and got her). She took to it really well and was falling asleep on her own within minutes by the fourth night. It was amazing.

But recently she has discovered how to pull up and it's back to being hellish to get her to sleep. It's like she dreads bedtime now and will start flipping out right after her bath. Last night she started screaming as soon as I sat her down on the floor still wrapped up in her towel. It took 20 minutes to wrestle her diaper and PJs on to her. She was red-faced and just screaming angrily with all her might. I tried everything to calm her down and nothing was working. So I gave in and nursed her and she almost immediately fell asleep in my arms. I put her down in her crib, and of course she woke up.

She started crying and I left the room. Within a few minutes, she was just grunting and it sounded like she was falling asleep. Soon she was silent. Then I hear someone playing the guitar. They must be playing it super loudly because our building has like concrete walls and we almost never hear our neighbours. I can feel my blood pressure rising as I know she's going to wake up from the noise. Curse you, noisy neighbour! As I sit anxiously waiting for her to wake up, I'm listening to the guitar and it's just awful. Not only is the neighbour being noisy, but they can't even play the guitar! As I continue to mentally ridicule my neighbour's lack of musical talent, I realise that the noise is actually coming from inside my apartment.

I go in the room to check on Ainslie, and there she is sitting up with her arm in between the bars of her crib stroking the guitar we left in there. I was so worked up, but at that moment I just burst into laughter. She was so deep in concentration. She heard me laughing and turned around with her little hand still flicking the strings and gave me this look like, ""Mommy, look what I can do!"" Oh, silly babies.

I was wondering if there's any other women creeping around here who gave their baby up for adoption. I had my daughter on June 9th (which coincided with a particularly terrible wildfire in the hills behind my town) and her parents took her home on the 10th from the hospital. They were present for her birth (well, not IN the room, but they saw her less than 10 minutes after she was born and were able to start bonding with her immediately). I saw Ashleigh and her parents the Wednesday before last for the first time since having her, and she is so beautiful. I can't even begin to say how proud I am of her, and of how well she and her parents are all doing together. They are a happy little family and she's getting love from all sides of the situation. There has been some lingering emotional aftermath for me (What kind of terrible woman gives her child away??) But I'm comfortable with my decision and am trying not to beat myself up over it too much, I know it was the right thing to do.

So are there any other birth mothers here, or is this the totally wrong place to be bringing this up?

I hope you all are having a lovely day :)",Discussion,False,,t5_2u06v,False,discussion,,True,t3_10o4p9,http://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/10o4p9/adoption_aftermath/,

1358974317.0,54,self.beyondthebump,1757ds,"Baby is 10.5 months old, has been on 12 flights, 8 trains, and crossed the Atlantic 6 times.  If it comes to travel, AMA.",WigglyBaby,63,9,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/1757ds/baby_is_105_months_old_has_been_on_12_flights_8/,"Well, it wasn't how we planned it.  My mom was diagnosed with Pancreatic cancer when I was 4 months pregnant.  She was realtively lucky, it was caught early enough to make her a candidate for surgery and chemo.  This bought her 15 months, and we had two 3 week visits with her -- the first when baby was 4-5 months, and the second when baby was 8-9 months (3 weeks covers almost a month!).  Mom got to see baby's first rolling over, first comando-style crawling, first teeth, first feedings, and first steps with the walker.  We also skyped regularly and it was such a joy to her to see her (only) grandchild develop like that.

I live in Europe, mom lived in the USA.  Unfortunately, the cancer beast got her in the end and we just had to go back for memorial services 5 weeks after returning to Europe. 

We've flown economy, economy plus and business. We've done trains across Switzerland and from Geneva to Paris for a short holiday.  

Been through Geneva, Zurich, Newark, Washington-Dulles, Raleigh-Durham, Greensboro, and Tampa airports with baby. Edit: most intense part was 5 flights in 4 days, including 1 trans-Atlantic flight.

Some of my tips include:

- bring your boppy on board, it makes lap sleeping a lot easier

- check how much more expensive business class is. Sometimes it is outrageous, sometimes it is only a little more -- it really depends on the season!!

- ask at the gate if there is a free seat for your car seat, and if so, bring that on board

- bring changes of clothes for you and several for baby

- bring more diapers and food than you need (we had a flight canceled and an overnight where we weren't sure to get our checked luggage although we did in the end)

- bring some dish soap to wash up spoons and such once baby is old enough.  I brought mine in a spare bottle and ""milked"" the bottle since I didn't have a spare squeeze bottle.  It leaked a little, but worked.

Baby is walking with a push toy now, but not on her own yet. She used the stroller as a push toy at the gate, and people thought that was really cute! When it comes to traveling with toddlers, I don't know... I understand that's a whole new can of worms :-) 

Anyway, I won't be glued on line as I'm back at work and probably in a different timezone from many of you (I'm going to bed after I post this), but I'm happy to answer any travel questions regarding babies (from getting passports, to managing pressure changes, to security/TSA) whenever I have bits of time tomorrow or afterwards.

1363640101.0,56,self.beyondthebump,1ajpoe,This has been floating around on facebook. Thought it fit here as well.,Raedeezey,67,11,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/1ajpoe/this_has_been_floating_around_on_facebook_thought/,"‎""We are sitting at lunch one day when my daughter casually mentions that she and her husband are thinking of ""starting a family."" ""We're taking a survey,"" she says half-joking. ""Do you think I should have a baby?""

""It will change your life,"" I say, carefully keeping my tone neutral.

""I know,"" she says, ""no more sleeping in on weekends, no more spontaneous vacations.""

But that is not what I meant at all. I look at my daughter, trying to decide what to tell her. I want her to know what she will never learn in childbirth classes.

I want to tell her that the physical wounds of child bearing will heal, but becoming a mother will leave her with an emotional wound so raw that she will forever be vulnerable.

I consider warning her that she will never again read a newspaper without asking, ""What if that had been MY child?"" That every plane crash, every house fire will haunt her.

That when she sees pictures of starving children, she will wonder if anything could be worse than watching your child die.

I look at her carefully manicured nails and stylish suit and think that no matter how sophisticated she is, becoming a mother will reduce her to the primitive level of a bear protecting her cub. That an urgent call of ""Mom!"" will cause her to drop a soufflé or her best crystal without a moments hesitation.

I feel that I should warn her that no matter how many years she has invested in her career, she will be professionally derailed by motherhood. She might arrange for childcare, but one day she will be going into an important business meeting and she will think of her
baby's sweet smell. She will have to use every ounce of discipline to keep from running home, just to make sure her baby is all right.

I want my daughter to know that every day decisions will no longer be routine. That a five year old boy's desire to go to the men's room rather than the women's at McDonald's will become a major dilemma. That right there, in the midst of clattering trays and screaming
children, issues of independence and gender identity will be weighed against the prospect that a child molester may be lurking in that restroom.

However decisive she may be at the office, she will second-guess herself constantly as a mother.

Looking at my attractive daughter, I want to assure her that eventually she will shed the pounds of pregnancy, but she will never feel the same about herself.

That her life, now so important, will be of less value to her once she has a child. That she would give herself up in a moment to save her offspring, but will also begin to hope for more years, not to accomplish her own dreams, but to watch her child accomplish theirs.

I want her to know that a cesarean scar or shiny stretch marks will become badges of honor.

My daughter's relationship with her husband will change, but not in the way she thinks.

I wish she could understand how much more you can love a man who is careful to powder the baby or who never hesitates to play with his child.

I think she should know that she will fall in love with him again for reasons she would now find very unromantic.

I wish my daughter could sense the bond she will feel with women throughout history who have tried to stop war, prejudice and drunk driving.

I want to describe to my daughter the exhilaration of seeing your child learn to ride a bike.

I want to capture for her the belly laugh of a baby who is touching the soft fur of a dog or cat for the first time.

I want her to taste the joy that is so real it actually hurts.

My daughter's quizzical look makes me realize that tears have formed in my eyes. ""You'll never regret it,"" I finally say. Then I reached across the table, squeezed my daughter's hand and offered a silent prayer for her, and for me, and for all the mere mortal women who stumble their way into this most wonderful of callings.
Please share this with a Mom that you know or all of your girlfriends who may someday be Moms. May you always have in your arms the one who is in your heart.""

1352802581.0,49,self.beyondthebump,1347f6,It's been a hard 2 weeks.  I had no idea how painful love can be.,JustForCancer,67,18,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/1347f6/its_been_a_hard_2_weeks_i_had_no_idea_how_painful/,"I've been meaning to post on here.  I've had the time and energy for a while but I guess mentally I wasn't all there or just needed space to fully digest what it is I'm feeling.

Last Monday I woke up from my nap to find Zahara burning hot and lethargic.  I took her temp which was 101 and we immediately took her to the hospital.

I can't even describe how panicked I was as the world around me moved at snails pace as I held my little lifeless child.  Everything seemed to take forever.

We had to watch everything.  My mom and I recorded times and medicines that were given to her, and since the Dr. only came to the hospital a few hours a day, we made sure to ask the dosages and times of all the meds since the nurses seemed to have no idea.  We continued to catch them trying to give her meds 6 hours early for 12 hour intervals, they refused to give her meds when she SHOULD have gotten meds.  

They had equipment to regulate how much antibiotics were going into her IV but after punching a bunch of random buttons the nurse said ""it's not working"" and we used a manual drip.  I was thankful for this, my mom kept an eye on it to make sure it was going in at the right times/doses.

The mosquitos were awful.  We were all covered in bites and had to ask 5 times for mosquito nets in which they just replied ""they're coming soon"".  If I have to hear ""soon"" to question again in my life I will lose it.

Day after day she seemed to get better.  Her white blood cell count was high indicating she had some kind of infection.  The last night I started having violent shakes/chills.  It really scared me and there seemed to be no doctors anywhere.  We had spent all our cash on the deposit to admit Zahara to the ward and the private room so I couldn't go to urgent care.

I got up and walked to Urgent care hoping to find someone that will at least look at my incision to see if it is infected thus giving me the shakes/chills/fever.

I was pretty much laughed at by the nurse and as I was walking out in tears a woman in her early 20's asked me what's wrong.  I explained my baby is admitted in the ward, that I have a doctors apt tomorrow but right now I'm feeling like I'm going to die and I can't stop shaking and just want to see if my incision is infected or if it looks okay.  She said she was a doctor and would look at it.  She said it was healing nicely and thinks that my lack of sleep/stress/hormone drop is causing my body to freak out.  She ordered me some hot tea and calmed me down enough to where I could sleep.

The next day my doctor had me tested for malaria, negative, thank God.  Zahara was eating well and seemed alert so we went home.  I can't tell you how much I never want to be in that hospital ever again.  

Upon thinking about how bad my experience was, I thought about all the people in the villages and the government hospitals.  How awful it must be to be given a spot on the floor, to not understand what is happening, to seeing your child sick and to not know what questions to ask or what you should be doing.  I plan on talking with our non profit board about comforting/providing food/toys to parents and children at the government hospitals.  That little conversation and kindness that doctor showed me for FREE was what I needed to calm my nerves down.

[Here](http://imgur.com/a/3idIi) are some pictures from the hospital.  The nets are on both of our beds, hers is white so it's hard to see.  She ripped out her IV so the doctor had to put it in again and wrap it all up her arm.  She loves her hands and this bothered her a lot.  Eventually she used it to rest her head on and it was kind of cute in a sad way.

You can also see the IV med machine standing by completely useless next to her bed.  It is amazing how much equipment they are not trained on or works, yet look all nice when you are touring the hospital.  

On a sad note, when we got home, we were told our guard dog Hope was poisoned and vomiting.  We got an injection of some sort from the vet and were told to wait.  She died the next day.  I cried.  Our guard Bro was the most upset.  He had spent every night with her for the last year.  Thieves will poison your dog then raid your house a few days later.  Bro said he hoped the thieves would come back so he could revenge for them killing his dog.  Obviously I was upset to come home to having to be paranoid about being raided.  I definitely had anxiety.

I'm so thankful my mom is here.  I don't think I could have handled the issues with the nurses and the meds on my own.  

Anyway, I hope to participate more now that things have settled.  We love our daughter.  Cashion can get her to stop crying almost immediately during those times where nothing works from me.  He's very sweet with her and I love watching them together.  

I thought about how I couldn't handle this life now that the circumstances have changed then I watched [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWHJ6-YhSYQ) video and it reminded me why I'm here.  Even if you are not religious in anyway it should help provide a little empathy to where I'm coming from.

What a road ladies :)

1373320360.0,52,self.beyondthebump,1hw50f,Rant about others' reactions to mamas who were unable to EBF...,brunettedaenerys,64,12,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/1hw50f/rant_about_others_reactions_to_mamas_who_were/,"tl;dr - moms who struggle with BFing need to be encouraged and reminded that they're awesome no matter how they end up feeding their LO. 


i'm a new mom and i always knew i would breastfeed. it was literally one of the only things i absolutely had my heart set on regarding my son's infant-hood. i, naively, never even entertained the idea that i *wouldn't* be able to. i had always just told myself, **""no matter how hard it might be, we'll get through it.""** fast forward 7 weeks into my son's life and i am now only pumping and supplementing with ~ 8 ounces of formula a day (due to supply and baby tummy issues). 

my baby is a ferocious eater and has a tongue-tie. once he had his first bottle around 3 weeks he went on a full boob strike, screaming and pulling away until SO and i broke down and gave him formula in the middle of the night. over the next month i read and tried everything out there to try to get him to go back to the breast. nothing worked. if anything, his resistance became worse. finally, i threw in the towel. 

the point of this story is so many times during the past month i have cried - to my husband, to my mom, while attempting to breastfeed an inconsolable baby, while feeding him with a bottle. a large reason for this is the loss of something that was so important to me, but another part has to do with me feeling like a failure. and i've slowly come to understand how wrong this is! 

such a huge emphasis is placed on the importance of breastfeeding in our culture currently, ie: ""breast is best"", ""there's nothing like mommy's milk"", ""it might be hard, but you CAN do it"". and though i get that these statements are meant to be encouraging (and may help the majority of the time) in cases like mine they only make a mother feel shittier. and that sucks. 

so if you know someone struggling with BFing at all, don't assume they just need to ""try harder"" or that they will ""get through it"". this is how literally everyone (IRL) responded to me. the only place i felt better was talking to women online and learning that not EBFing in no way makes me a bad mom or a failure (and that pumping around the clock is a hell of a lot harder!) if you find yourself in a position where you're encouraging a woman struggling with BFing, please also remind her that she's awesome. and that no matter what happens there is NOTHING WRONG with pumping, formula feeding or mixing it up! 

and to all you moms that struggled with BFing or chose formula or exclusively pumping, etc. you're AMAZING. you're giving your LO exactly what he or she needs and you have NO REASON to feel any less of a mom than the 50 other moms you know who EBF with ease. ok. end rant. :)",,False,,t5_2u06v,False,,BOY,True,t3_1hw50f,http://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/1hw50f/rant_about_others_reactions_to_mamas_who_were/,

I realize that we general and mostly are still very helpful and supportive but recently with just 1 post we became angry and divided.  I am late to the game here and there were too many comments to read through them all but was filled in on how nasty things got.

Here's the deal ladies and gents.. this community was created for /r/babybump mama's to continue on together after pregnancy and share our continued support, advice, stories and the likes as our kids grow up.  We started this sub as an alternative to the usually more ""reddit-like"" (define that as you'd like) style of /r/parenting and /r/mommit ... but after what went on in the weight loss post I wonder if this community has become too large that perhaps it is finding it's way into that more ""reddit-like"" behavior that previous.

I see less and less of the mama's I was pregnant with and more unknowns (bound to happy as more ladies pop and join us).  But I also see more and more of this need to be aggressive and rude.  Of course we can only do so much to keep the peace and can't control what you say or do but, come on people!  Can we PLEASE not tear each other down.  We are all new parents.  Some of us maybe have more experience than others but we've all been where others are standing now.

STOP WITH THE HATE ON HERE!!  If you don't like something or have nothing kind to say, don't say anything at all.  Rule number one in life.  You can much easier close out the window and ignore a post rather than use it as a reason to hurt someone else's feelings.  Think before you speak.

**T - is it true?**
**H - is it helpful?**
**I - is it inspiring?**
**N - is it necessary?**
**K - is it kind?**

If you cannot follow these 5 simple things to reply to any post on here than you shouldn't be replying to it.  Simple as that.

So if we do not put them to bed with pants or onesies on, diapers are gone within minutes. 

They sleep in toddler beds, and sometimes I hear them playing quietly with their toys, and I let it happen. But last night they started crying. I come in and the room is destroyed, toy boxes dumped, clothes pulled out of dressers (my babysitter forgot to lock them) and hamper overturned. And NO DIAPERS. 

I go to wrangle the boys and put their clothes on, and notice just on the insides of both of their feet, there's poop. Not a lot, but that is definitely poop.

So my husband and I spend the next half hour desperately searching for the poop. We pick up everything that was on the floor, we check their beds, under the mattresses under the bed. We check in the closet, in their drawers and toy bins. NO POOP. 

No poop in the diapers.
No poop on their butts.
No signs of poop being eaten (ick.)

It's just gone. There's no poop. Just a small bit on their feet. Not even on their hands.

Constant fussing, twelve bibs a day, puking everywhere, clinginess, and eventually just screaming in pain. Naturally, I've had to deal with 99% of this, because my SO is too busy playing video games or being tired from working his oh-so-demanding 40 hours a week retail job to lift a finger to help me for more than 20 minutes. No night wakes. No naps for me. 

I went to work at 2 yesterday. Left kiddo here with the MIL and BIL (15): SO would be home at 430 to take over. He said he was going to make them dinner, and the BIL would spend the weekend. Fine, whatever. Once I get to work, I discover that I'm working a turnaround. Meaning I'm working until 11pm, and need to be back at work at 9am the next (this) morning. I text SO this.

I get home at 1115 and another friend is in my living room. Baby's asleep. I shove food in my face, tell SO I'm going to bed, and go to bed. 1130. Baby wakes up at 130. I'm a walking corpse: SO's playing video games. Doesn't acknowledge me. Guess who has to take care of baby? Baby wakes up again at 330 (SO's in bed by now.) Again: guess who gets baby duty? Baby decides it's time to be *up* at 5am. And, one more time, guess who gets to wake up? I'm running on 4 hours of sleep and I have to go to work in 3 hours. Zero chance of a nap. As it stands, baby is pretty much whining nonstop. Won't chew, won't sleep, won't eat. Just crying. I don't know when I'm going to freaking get a shower. All three men are sleeping and offering zero assistance.

And, to top it off, my kitchen is *trashed*. It was immaculate when I left. I came home to a sink overflowing with dishes ((the dishwasher is empty...)), a stove where all four burners are occupied by dirty pots and pans, an overflowing trash can, food debris on the floor, and even more used dishes/cutting boards/crap on every single counter. I have no room to make breakfast or do anything in there. In 9 hours, they managed to take an out-of-a-magazine kitchen and transform it into that of a bachelor who hasn't cleaned in a week. 

I'm fucking done. I'm ready to just set the baby in bed next to my SO, tell him I'm leaving, and just walk out. I'm fucking sick of having to do everything around here. I don't get to sleep, I have to put off *basic essentials* like using the bathroom, taking a shower, or eating, because he's too fucking occupied getting his 10 hours of sleep or hanging with the bros. Oh, sure, when I get ultra-pissed off he notices, and tells me to ""calm down"" and ""chill out."" But until then, I don't get an ounce of help. I left this place clean, expecting that people could behave like fucking adults and pick up after themselves, and instead I get a huge mess that *I'm* expected to clean while they're sleeping, while simultaneously caring for a miserable and inconsolable child that I'd spent five days straight caring for.",,False,,t5_2u06v,False,,BOY,True,t3_1dq9wl,http://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/1dq9wl/im_about_to_walk_out/,

Overreacting?",Munchees,54,9,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/13brom/stepmom_adjusted_my_1_month_old_daughter_and_she/,"So my father was visiting today and pretty much berated me on my ""mommy issues"". IE- I was vocally adamant that I did NOT want my stepmother to take Adrienne to Walmart, because flu season. Also, I'm the devil because my daughter is a tummy sleeper (4-6 hours... at ONE month old) and I don't fight her on it. If she sleeps on her back, we're lucky to get a solid 30 minutes out of her. Because of this, I want my daughter to get SIDS and die, apparently. Not joking.

After the verbal spew-fest, he proceeded to tell me that a few days ago when they were over visiting her (and told me to go and take a nap) that my stepmom adjusted my daughter. My problem with this is a long story. My stepmom's father is a chiropractor, and asked me when Adrienne was born if I would like for him to adjust her. I told him that frankly I didn't know about adjusting babies, and I was uncomfortable with the idea until I spoke to Adrienne's pediatrician about it. After conferring with the pediatrician, I was told to not allow spinal adjustments until at least 6 months if I was adamant about it. If I wasn't, she recommended not getting her adjusted until she started school. I told my grandfather that I appreciated his offer, but would pass until a later time.

My stepmom, apparently, took it upon herself to go behind my back and adjust my daughter. By hanging her upside down by her ankles and letting gravity ""do it's thing"". My stepmom isn't a chiropractor, obviously, because baby chiropractors do NOT adjust this way. And I feel as if she overstepped some serious boundaries. This is my child, and my call. If they want to adjust infants, I suggest they have more children.

The conversation with my father ended up in an argument and me asking him to leave. I have yet to approach my stepmother on this, because frankly I feel as if I need to cool my jets before I blow up on a bitch before the holidays. 

Outside perspectives, please.

EDIT: Thanks you all for your responses. It's nice to know it's not just the hormones raging. I have called my stepmom, and told her that I was sure she meant well and thought she had Adrienne's best interest at heart. However, I am not okay with her deciding as a grown adult to go behind my back as a mother and do what she sees fit, regardless of my feelings on the matter. Until further notice, she is welcome to come visit Adrienne with SO or I present, as is my father, but I will not be leaving them alone with her. My parents are unhappy, but I'm sticking to my guns. I could get over the WalMart thing, but this is just another level of stepping on toes. They have to accept that I'm the parent here, not them.

Words cannot describe my heartbreak! One minute she was in my arms, the next minute she was crashing down on the hardwood floor. It happened in slow motion.... We went to the ER to check her out, she is fine according to them and X-rays, but I am so worried about her trust in me and our bond. I know at 3 months, she doesn't realize I'm the one who dropped her, but she just seems....different today. I'm not sure if its my projections, or just the stress of all the stimulation yesterday, but I hope she returns to her smiley, joyful self soon.

I am fearful of my confidence- I feel like an aweful mother, like I don't belong doing this. My husband wasn't very supportive of me, he sort of looked angry when he came home from work to take us to the hospital. While we were there, he said ""don't worry, I don't hate you"". Why would he say that?!? It just didn't feel like we were on the same team. I know he was worried about her (she screamed for over an hour), but I could've really used some reassurance too. 

Anyways, I guess I'm just looking for some support, I feel a like a broken lil mama today. 

EDIT: thank you all for your comments, it seriously helped me feel better today (I know that it seems horrible to say your misfortunes made me feel better), but the solidarity and ability to relate is why I love this sub. So thank you so very much for sharing, it certainly helped me move passed the grief I was feeling!

The bed got made around 3:30. 

The diapers soaked a little longer, 

The odor grew a little stronger 

The crumbs I spilled the day before, 

Are staring at me from the floor. 

The fingerprints there on the wall, 

Will likely be there still next fall. 

The dirty streaks on the windowpanes, 

Will still be there next time it rains. 



Shame on you, they sit and say, 

Just what did you do today? 

I held a baby till she slept, 

I held a toddler while he wept. 

I played a game of hide and seek, 

I squeezed a toy so it would squeak. 

I pulled a wagon, sang a song, 

Taught a child right from wrong. 



What did I do this whole day through? 

Not much that shows, I guess that's true. 

Unless you think that what I've done, 

Might be important to someone 

With deep green eyes and soft brown hair, 

If that is true....I've done my share.

I gave birth to my beautiful son 13 days ago, Jeremy Hunter. He's precious, he sleeps a lot and usually is an easy baby. He latched right away and breastfeeding has been a breeze for us. However I can't help but feel so overwhelmed. 

The first week my SO's mom was here, and it was great, she's wonderful. All of these things are great.

My mom has been nothing but annoying as all hell. She works full time and constantly complains to me about how ""unfair it is that she's only seen HER baby (my son) four times so far."" Now we have no car, she does. We live 20 minutes away. She only works until 3pm everyday, as far as I'm concerned it's not like I'm going to hop on the train in Chicago with my 13 day old son and ride the train for 45 minutes to see her (longer on public trans). And when she is here she complains that he's eating and she wants to hold him so I should unlatch him (wtf). And she'll just stand over me and stare at him sucking my boob. It's freaking weird. Not to mention she likes to tell everyone how much ""she's doing for us"" she told my grandma she was with me in the hospital 24/4, she brought us groceries, took us shopping. None of those things happened. It's just frustrating and annoying to hear about her constant lies about my family to make herself the center of attention to look good when in reality she hasn't done ANYTHING.

Whatever, fine. But now my Grandma's here and staying with us for a week. Which is wonderful and I love her but she wants to clean EVERYTHING. As in organize and rearrange. The house is clean, my clothes are clean, but she insists on re doing everything, which would be helpful if she didn't ask my questions every ten minutes. She now wants to re-arrange the baby's room. NO NO NO NO NO. That is MY project and I spent a lot of time and work on his room. And I love it. But she insists. She wants to change him and it's no help because I constantly have to do it. She doesn't wipe underneath his balls (she had three girls) and last time put the diaper on super loose and he pooped and it went out of his diaper and all over his clothes and blanket. 

On top of all of this me and my fiance are sick, like chest cold. It's pretty shitty and I'm worn out. now more so than before.

Between breastfeeding every two hours, and being sick and gross feeling, my pelvis and hips are killing, my stitches hurt, dealing with all of the people that want to see my baby and do things their way and not listening to me, my SO not helping as much (it's now 1:30 and he's still sleeping but I shouldn't complain because he has been great), and my baby only wanting to be held by me, I feel like I'm loosing it here. 

Jeremy's usually totally fine. But he'll only fall asleep in my arms and he screams and screams and only gets soothed if I hold him. This turns our feedings into 90 minute long sessions of him crying everytime I put him down and then pooping his diaper the second I put him down, then waking up and screaming to be changed and then not falling back asleep. Then he passes out for four hours. 

I'm exhausted. I'm tired. I feel like crap. And people keep telling me I can't do this, I'm not ready, I have no idea what I'm in for. GREAT. That's not helping now. He's here now, and I do not think it was a mistake. I do know what I'm doing, I love him more than anything, I'm just tired right now. I'm still doing everything right and trying my hardest I'm just stressed and tired.

She will be exactly 7 months old in 22 hours. 

Sometimes, like tonight, when she wakes, she reaches for me from her crib where she lay whining and fussing. Most times I just rub her belly or her back and she'll fall right back to sleep. But other times, like tonight, I pick her up, cradle her in my arms, hold her tight against me and we stare at each other. 

I can't help but cry. I am so in love with her. 

I wish I had a way to tell her. A way that she would understand without having to become a mother. 

I write to her. I set up an email account for her and I write to her whenever the mood strikes. 

I write to her and try not to get too sappy since I know full well that when she reads it, she probably still won't understand just how much I cherish her. 

It all sounds so cliched, but it is so true. 

It's times like this that I think of that song in Les Mis and sing in my head ""Let me live! Let me live!"" 

And I hope beyond hope that someone or something will allow me, bless me or by some stroke of luck I get to watch her grow old. And she, I.

I hope. 

Because when I look at her, I know that every hardship I've had to bear, every misfortune, and every success has led me to her. And I'd live it all over again just to be with her.

As you know if you read my previous post, our guard dog was poisoned and killed putting us on alert for a thief to come.  Today as we went to have coffee in town, we returned home to find all our cash gone.  It is bizarre.  Our front door and bedroom door were still locked and we have bars on the windows.  They must have used a small child to go through the bars which the detective that came said that he has seen it before.  

My friend Heidi that is here trying to adopt an abandoned child lost all her cash that we had stored away for her in our room.  

I feel so vulnerable.  Cashion said not to worry because we are protected better at night with a guard and a busy road near by but I still feel sick to my stomach.  I feel like I can't get a break from anxiety, from Zahara's birth, to her getting sick, to our dog being poisoned, to a thief breaking in and stealing our money.  I guess it could have been worse, they didn't take the computers or my camera or my mom's iphone that was near by.  

Heidi is on her way back from the orphanage.  I feel knots brewing knowing how many bumps she has had along the way and to have this problem on top of it. 

I don't want to post anything on facebook and freak out my family or hers (her mom is on my facebook and gets worried easy).  But I had to let it out.  Cashion isn't very comforting because this is a part of life to him.  He grew up with the constant threat of thieves.  I guess I just need to him to say WHAT THE HELL and freak out once and a while.  Maybe that isn't any better.

The fact that we had everything locked and someone still got in is making me feel the most scared.  I have a daughter now.  This is most definitely my ""shit just got real"" moment here and it feels awful.

I don't know if I can do this guys.  I'm praying for strength and to be thankful no one was home and no one got hurt.

BTW last night our guard had to stay home with his pregnant wife.  Instead of going without a guard I begged Cashion to bring someone else so our guard's brother came all night last night instead.  

I also wonder how many thieves Hope (our guard dog) kept away that we don't even know about.  Everyone was afraid of her bark even though she wouldn't hurt a fly.  I miss her already.  She would have scared away the thieves today for sure if she was still alive.

I normally don't panic in situations like these but since I've had Zahara I've become a changed woman.  I don't know if it is the hormones or being a new mom or both but I want the hell out of here sometimes.

Sorry for ranting, you guys are the closest friends I have that I can vent to without having my family freaking out on facebook.  My mom is a bit unnerved but is handling things well... my dad is the worry wart.

We live in Oklahoma and we have been getting some crazy weather lately but thank goodness almost all of it has gone around my town. Well we are still in the hospital and at around 5 last night the hospital issued a code black. There was a huge mile wide F3 tornado less than 10 miles away and headed straight towards us. It was so terrifying. They were telling people that if they couldn't get underground then they needed to leave as fast as possible and that closets and bathrooms were not safe enough. Well for some reason my hospital doesn't have a basement so they made all of the moms, dads, and newborns squeeze into the nursery since it did not have a wall close to outside. I think there were about 12 recovering mommas in there. It was hell. The tornado got only 1 mile away from us and decided to change directions so we all were very lucky. The tornado killed 9 people total, injured over 100, and caused tons of damage. That was possibly one of the scariest moments of my life.

You've been warned.),what_a_classy_broad,46,5,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/13id2h/graduated_early_long_post_youve_been_warned/,"I kinda wanna start out just saying this:  It feels so weird posting here.  Like I shouldn't be yet.. probably because I actually shouldn't.  A few days ago, I was seven months pregnant. Now I'm suddenly someone's mom, even if it doesn't feel like it yet.  Without further ado, however.. the story of how we got here.  

I woke up this past Saturday morning with some dull cramping.  Thought for the first hour or so I just needed to poop in the worst way possible and maybe things were more backed up than I'd anticipated.  I spent a couple hours going about my business and trying to get it to stop in all the usual ways (drink a ton of water, rest, move around a little, fly to the moon and back on a magic sea turtle.. you know).  None of that worked.  If anything, it felt like things were getting worse.

So, of course, I called my doctor's emergency line and left a message with the promise I'd have a call back in the next 30 minutes.  My practice's on-call doctor, bless her, called me back in less than five and told me to go ahead and come up to the hospital.  I do exactly that, all the while with the expectation that she's going to take one look at me and tell me to call her if I haven't pooped by the end of the week.  Worried as I was that something might be wrong, having this baby was still the furthest possibility from my mind.  

By the time I get to the hospital, it's roughly 12:30pm and I've been having these strange cramps for six hours.  It's about this time that I'm absolutely sure they're contractions of some sort.. and they're far too regular to be Braxton Hicks.  They monitor me, pump me full of fluids, et cetera... but the monitors aren't picking up any contractions at all.  The nurse can't feel any manually, and no one believes a word I'm saying.  I must have heard ""She thinks she's contracting,"" at least fifty times that day.  It's at this point that they go ahead and give me something to stop contractions just in case and start talking infections leading to a pretty short decision to start me on antibiotics. 

By 5:00, I'm miserable.  The contractions have gone from maybe a 5 on the pain scale to an 8.  No one believes me still and I've had absolutely nothing for pain... but they go ahead and opt to transfer me to a hospital equipped for level 3 births.  At this point, I'm not sure if they really don't believe me or if they're just pretending not to because no one wants to freak the pregnant lady out.

6:30 rolls around and I'm finally carted off to hospital #2 via ambulance.  The EMTs were probably the nicest, most entertaining and understanding people I encountered all day.  It was a good time for them, too.  Every (literal) bump in the road caused another contraction and they were progressing pretty quickly.  I'm admitted at the university hospital and the only thing I remember between the back of the ambulance and the room they dropped me off in is the smell of onion rings in the hall outside triage.  Somehow, even in so much pain that I can hardly breathe through a contraction and am speaking in tiny two word bursts... that smell made me ravenously hungry.  

8:00pm - they've moved me to yet another room, after a couple hours of blindingly painful contractions that someone's FINALLY been able to palpitate.  Yay! Someone believes me now!  Things get progressively more intense for the next hour, leading to a lot of screaming and not being sure what's going on anymore.  My mom and best friend are there, but I've hardly noticed.  The doctors are still talking possible infection and keep telling me my water must have broken days or even weeks beforehand.  

This leads to my mother giving them the biggest bitch fit ever, on my behalf.  The short translation came down to her telling them (in no uncertain terms) that her daughter's certainly not stupid enough to have missed something as obvious as her water breaking.  All the while, I'm insisting the same thing and they're standing around telling me I'm wrong.  

Cue my water breaking and the foulest smell I've ever experienced.  Take that, smartypants doctor people.  My self-satisfaction lasted all of two seconds before I realized what that meant, though.  Oh shit, oh fuck, oh my sweet baby jebus.. my water just broke.  

The doctor checks my cervix again and I've gone from the same half centimeter dilated that I'd been all day... to full on ready to go, hey let's have a baby.  I'm in so much pain at this point that the morphine they give me does nothing.  Nothing at all.  I didn't even know they gave it to me.  It hurts enough that I'm half convinced I'm dying and half wishing I would just to make it stop and honestly... having a baby at that point is the best idea EVER.  Whatever makes it not hurt.  Anything.  I'll let you cut my foot off, just make it stop hurting.  

The doctor lady is about halfway through telling me I can push if I feel like I need to when I start.  I didn't even make it through one push before the baby came flying out of me like a human cannonball, though, and they whisked her off to the magical baby corner to do all that post-natal baby stuff.  

I'm not real sure what's going on with ME at this point, because I'm too busy twisting around to try and see where they took her and if she's even alive.  They rushed her to the NICU and got me to stop bleeding, though, and everything blinked out of existence for at least two minutes.  All I could do was lay there in that gnarly mess and be relieved that it didn't hurt anymore.  

Fast forward a few days - I'm doing absolutely fine.  I came home from the hospital yesterday afternoon and I'm hardly even bleeding anymore.  

Charlotte River, born November 17th at 12 weeks premature, weighed 2lbs 4oz and was fourteen inches long.  They pulled her breathing tube Sunday morning and she's been making steady progress ever since.  Her color is fantastic, she can already cry and all the NICU nurses keep telling me how well she's doing and that their biggest problem so far has been figuring out how to keep the oddly sized CPAP mask on her face.. and that getting an IV in her is every bit as hard as getting one into her mother.

The baby sleeps (sort of). The SO sleeps. Meanwhile, I haven't slept a full night in SIX MONTHS. How is that fair? I was up with the baby this morning at about 7 a.m., per usual. I've gotten dressed, brushed my teeth, nursed the baby, straightened up the living room, and am about to attempt breakfast. All with no help, and all on very little sleep due to the baby party at 4 a.m. last night. Meanwhile, SO is sleeping away in the bedroom with the dog, all warm and comfy.

This is something that keeps us at odds. He feels it's OK to sleep in on the weekends, and nap during the evenings because HE's tired. I get that he has to go to work 5 days a week, and that he has to get up early to get ready. Sorry, but so what?? He gets his evenings and the whole weekend to relax. I hardly EVER get a break. I have to beg him to take the baby while I shower! It's so unfair. I'm so mad I feel like my insides are boiling. 

And to make matters worse, once the baby is fed and asleep for his first nap (again, with no help), he'll want sexy times. And if I try to nap, he'll complain. Because what he wants is apparently more important than what I want. I hear stories of SO's that help out during the night even though they have to work, and SO's that draw candle-lit baths for their tired ladies. I believe these men to be a myth.

My name is Melissa, I’m twenty-four and on August 12th my husband and I welcomed our son Milo into the world.. And my life changed. I have never been so in love, so tired, so emotional, or so happy in my entire life. Although no one here knows me, beyondthebump has been there with me through so much. Those sleepless first nights when I was searching for ways to just make him sleep. Those moments when I felt like a failure of a mother, when all I did when he cried was crying along with him. When I realized I suffered from some pretty terrible postpartum depression, and then when I realized that doesn’t make me a horrible mother. When Milo smiled his first real smile and I cried...again. So many moments that I will forever remember and would do anything to re-live, over and over again...the photos and videos are never enough. I want to thank you all for being there when I was at my lowest, my absolute lowest. Without knowing it, many of you reassured me that it gets better, that it actually gets amazing. So for anyone else at their lowest...it gets better, and one day you may wake up, see that baby smile, and wonder to yourself “when did things get so.. Great?” because WHOA...[this baby](http://imgur.com/vMGfC) is my favorite anything.

I've been to my gynocologist 3 times. We use lube. I use estrogen cream. I was losing hope that sex would ever be something to look forward to again. 

This physiotherapist gives me hope. She works with desensitizing the nerves while also teaching you exercises to work with the muscles and scar tissue. She works on bathroom urgency if that's an issue for you. She specializes in all this stuff I felt my gynocologist should have been able to help me with.
