I've never really considered myself a lakers fan, even after moving to LA 4 years ago. I had a slight disdain for Kobe, stemming from his perceived arrogance. I've come to realize that I really just never understood the man. 

I started off the season a hardcore clippers fan (and still am). Being from Louisiana, Chris Paul has been my favorite player since he entered the league. Him joining the Clippers was a dream come true. So naturally after all the offseason moves of the Lakers, I was a bit jealous and my resentment only increased. I found myself enjoying the Lakers misfortunes along with most of the other non-Laker fans. Though as the season went on, something strange began to happen with me. As I learned more and more about Kobe, read interviews, watched him play, heard his post game comments I began to develop an incredible respect for him. This respect grew in to grudging admiration and before I knew it, I was a fan. In the past couple weeks this feeling has only intensified. Something about the drama of the Lakers season began drawing me in in a big way. Now suddenly I find myself rooting for them every single game, rooting for them just as strongly as the Clips. It just dawned on me tonight, watching Kobe pull off the miraculous to will his team to victory, that I'm all in.

So to wind up this pointless rant, I just want to say: I'm one of you guys now. I want to see these guys win it all so bad, and truly believe they could do it. It would be the greatest sports saga of my entire life, and an unbelievable milestone in Kobe's career. So here's to the Lakers and to you guys. LET'S DO THIS!!!!

1362166037.0,189,self.lakers,19h96e,"Lakers Post ASG Race to the Playoffs, Week 1 Update!",Joelo246,210,21,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/19h96e/lakers_post_asg_race_to_the_playoffs_week_1_update/,"Alright here's how this works. Below are predicted scenarios where the Lakers can pass GSW, UTAH, or HOU. If any of these teams get above +0 against the predicted pace, it's bad for us. If everyone is at 0, it means we're on track for the playoffs. If we go into the negative, it's bad. If they go into the negative, awesome. First letter is actual result (W/L), second is predicted result.

This thread will be updated daily and once a week I'll do a weekly update.

**Summary of the week**: Lakers gain solid ground on all 3 teams ahead of them post ASG with a 4-1 run compared to 3-3 for GSW, 2-2 for Houston and 1-3 for Utah. We're in good shape, but still havent' won any games we weren't supposed to, and need a lot more solid weeks like this before we lock up a playoff spot.

**We Gives thanks to...**: Monta Ellis for that absurd buzzer beater to put away Houston... David Lee for getting suspended from what ended up being a 4 point loss to NYC after 54 from Curry... Kobe for looking like he was still 28 and dominant all week... Boston for losing to us the day after the great Jerry Buss's passing, and then taking care of Utah for us a few days later.

**Lakers predicted finish** : 20-8 to finish at 45-37

**Actual Finish (So far)** : 7-2

**+/- Against predicted pace** : +1

**Games out of 8th** : .5

**Schedule Strength** : 12 of lakers last 23 games are against current playoff teams. 5 of those 12 are against elite playoffs teams (&gt;60% win %) plus Chicago on the cusp (58.5%). They have 9 games against basement teams (&lt;40% win %) and 10 against mid-range teams (40-60%). 11 are at home and 12 on the road.

**Analysis** : Lakers schedule is not impossible, but with 7 extremely tough games plus 3 against close rivals in the standings and needing to go 20-8, this inconsistent lakers team has zero margin for error. They must dominate all the soft games on the schedule and find ways to win all the close ones. And in the middle of all that they need one of the three teams above them to have a rough finish.

**Weekly Update**: This was a very solid week for the lakers. We took care of business in two very close games against teams that were virtually tied with us - Portland and Dallas. We got a revenge win on Boston, we handled Minnesota the way a good team should. Kobe and Nash are at the top of their games, the role players finally know their minutes and are producing consistently, and Dwight has looked engaged on defense every game. Only loss was in Denver... and honestly, back to back in Denver where they are 24-3 (2nd best home record in the NBA) - that would've been a really tough one for us to win, and it was okay to drop it. That said, 4-1 in the first week doesn't gain us any games on the pace we need - it just keeps us on track. We got ATL, OKC, NOH, TOR &amp; CHI this week, if we can win 3 of those 5 we will be in great shape.

**Player of the Week**: Kobe Bryant (easy pick, as he was the actual Western Conference player of the week): Turns back the clock with some vintage 4th Quarter closing against Dallas &amp; Portland, big dunks against Minny, and blew off his cold outside shooting by going 9/21 from deep over the week. Kobe Averaged 31.2/6.8/6.4 on 55.8% shooting over the week and POWERED lakers through to a 4-1 week. 

**Daily Update** : Oh my god. I don't think I've watched two back-to-back regular season games EVER by the lakers that were that up and down and that exciting. Part of that is because the lakers regular season games have never mattered this much, but also the games Kobe has been putting down are absurd, even for him. If there's a drug that gives a player the eye-of-the-tiger, this guy must be taking it. 3 three in the last 2 minutes to force overtime, are you kidding me? All that said, I'm torn between feeling like we are SCREWED in the playoffs if our defense is going to put us in these kind of holes against bad teams like NO and TOR, and excited to see the team perform so well under pressure. Watching Nash and Kobe take shots in the 4th is fucking exciting right now, because both of them are just making all the big ones. Pumped my fist every time Rudy Gay took a shot too, he cant make shit outside 10 feet (derozan made a few ridiculous ones though). At the end of the day, we are winning the stupid close ones the same way we lost them early in the season, and that's what matters. I just hope we can improve our defensive fundamentals while riding this crazy mojo down the stretch. Chicago at home next will be a very tough one, but one we can afford to lose thanks to two ridiculous wins in a row. 

**Complete** : BOS(W-W), POR(W-W), @DAL(W-W), @DEN(L-L), MIN(W-W) | ATL(W-L), @OKC(L-L), @NOH(W-W), TOR(W-W)

**Incomplete** :CHI(X-L), @ORL(X-W), @ATL(X-L), @IND(X-L), SAC(X-W), @PHX(X-W), WAS(X-W), @GSW(X-W), @MIN(X-W), @MIL(X-W), @SAC(X-W), DAL(X-W), MEM(X-L), @LAC(X-L), NOH(X-W), @POR(X-W), GSW(X-W), SAS(X-W), HOU(X-W)

**Golden State Warriors predicted finish** : 15-15 to finish 45-37

**Actual Finish (So far)** : 5-6

**+/- Against predicted pace** : +0

**Games Ahead of Lakers** : 3 (6.5 before All-Star break)

**Schedule Strength** : 10 of their final 25 are against playoff teams, 4 against elite teams, 8 against basement dwellers, 11 against mid-range teams. 16 of 25 are at home.

**Analysis** : GSW's schedule is pretty favourable, but they have been doing the poorest lately. They have 2 games against houston, 2 against LA and 1 against utah left, plus a loss to utah already since the break, so if they can't get their mojo back they could be knocked out of the playoffs directly by the teams around them.

**Weekly Update**: It's been a roller coaster week in Golden State. Bogut's gone back out. Curry's in god mode. Lee got suspended on the eve of a really important game in New York for brawling in Indiana. They somehow beat San Antonio to get ahead of the pace, but I have no idea what they're going to look like next week after a long road trip. They've got a soft portion of the schedule coming up, so if they fail to take care of business against any basement teams this week we'll really know if there's a chance GSW will freefall out of the playoffs.

**Player of the Week**: Gotta be Stephen Curry. Shows a little of the ""eff you"" mode that few NBA players have, kicking in an NBA season high 54 against NYC IN NYC. Puts down 30 PPG over the week on 54% shooting including a ridiculous 53.8% from 3 (28 of 52). Oh and he averaged 4 boards and 6 dimes over the same stretch.

**Daily Update** : Golden State loses its first of 5 games against its three playoff rivals, dropping a 12 point egg in the 4th quarter to lose by 6. I'm going to go ahead and say this was a good outcome for the lakers - Golden State is more likely to falter down the stretch than Houston, and we can't catch everyone. The criminally underrated Chandler Parsons has another sick game, shooting 6/8 from 3 for 26 points on 13 shots. Harden gets his usual 20/6/11, Asik gets 17 boards, Klay Thompson and Stephen Curry continue to be one of the sickest shooting backcourts in the league (combined 46 points and 7/14 from 3), Bogut plays 28 decent minutes but can't contribute on offense (1/5... one 3 made??).

**Utah Jazz predicted finish** : 13-15 to finish 43-39

**Actual Finish (So far)** : 2-6

**+/- Against predicted pace** : -1

**Games Ahead of Lakers** : .5 (5.5 before ASG)

**Schedule Strength** : 12 of 22 games against playoff teams, 9 against elite teams, 6 against basement dwellers and 7 against mid-range teams. 12 of 23 at home.

**Analysis** : Utah's schedule is tough. With 10 elite opponents and a vulnerable roster, I feel good about our chances of having them struggle down the stretch.

**Weekly Update**: Rough week for Utah was expected - they were playing 4 solid playoff teams. Most experts and fans are coming around to the idea that Utah is the most likely to drop out of the playoffs, and I agree. They don't have the explosiveness to win random games with outside shooting against elite teams like GSW and HOU do, and they have by far the hardest closing stretch. This week coming up is much easier for Utah, starting with games against Charlotte, Milwaukee and Cleveland, but if they drop ANY of those we'll be in great shape.

**Player of the Week**: Gordon Hayward has been quietly killing it off the bench all week, scoring 19.2 PPG while shooting 41% from 3 and getting to the line 8 times a game. His gem was 26 points on 16 shots in Boston in a 3 point loss. 

**Daily Update** : Chicago hands Utah a very tightly contested 89-88 loss, Bellinelli was the hero with an efficient 22 point night and the game winning 3. With the two bad losses preceding it, Utah has to really be feeling the pressure in this race to the playoffs. Lakers have been closing the gap every day and there's barely anything left of their lead now. Tough game against New York next, and Oklahoma/Memphis/New York/Houston next week... good luck Utah!

**Houston Rockets predicted finish** : 15-12 to finish 44-38

**Actual Finish (So far)** : 5-3

**+/- Against predicted pace** : +0

**Games Ahead of Lakers** : 2 (3.5 before ASG)

**Schedule Strength** : 9 of 22 games against playoff teams, 6 against elite teams, 10 
against trash and 8 against mid-range teams. 13 of 22 at home

**Analysis** : Houston's schedule is pretty easy, and of the three teams ahead of us I think their team is the most well constructed to compete down the stretch. They play phoenix fucking 4 times and the kings twice. They've been playing well lately and I honestly think we have a better chance of catching a tumbling utah or GSW than houston, even if they are our closest target.

**Weekly Update**: Of the three teams ahead of us, we gained the least ground on Houston, but they remain the closest target. They had a bizarre week in winning both games I expected them to lose (Brooklyn, OKC) and losing both games I expected them to win (WAS, MIL). At this point this is a classic team that lives and dies by the 3 and can beat or lose to any team on any night. So where will they finish? Fuck if I know, I'm 0/4 on predicting them so far.

**Player of the Week**: I guess we have to default this to James Harden after he willed his team past former team OKC with a ridiculous night - 46 points on an absurd 19 shots to go with 8 boards and 6 assists. For the week James averaged 30/5/6 on 52% FG and 50% 3PT%. 

**Daily Update** : Won't recap this one much as I did above, but overall it's good for us that Houston squeezed this one out. Surprisingly low scoring game (94-88) for these two dominant 3 point shooting teams (and both teams made 42.9% of their 3s this game). In the end Houston strangled the 4th and pulled it out. Houston's schedule gets really soft this week (my base predictions have them kicking off a 7 game winning streak tonight). If they drop any bad ones the lakers may still have a chance against them, but this schedule is soffffft.

I came over here because of a link in the side bar of r/NBA. It could be the few beers I've had watching the Bulls game, or it could be the fact that things are panning out so weird this season - but I've been reading a lot of negative comments about the Lakers lately and I just wanted to come over and say:

I'm sorry dudes. Seriously. The picture of Kobe on the side bar is epic, depressing, sad, confusing, and all of the above. We lost Rose to injury this season - but shit, man. Even I felt the loss when they announced Kobe's injury. I'm sorry Howard acted like a piece of shit the last game, I'm sorry that Kobe didn't get his full chance at another ring and I hope his accomplishments won't be forgotten as LeBron goes on a fucking rampage of the finals for the next few years.

I hope you guys are back to full strength next year.

I am almost 32 years old, and an LA resident all my life. I have watched the lakers win since I was born. All the titles in the 80s, the heart ache of the 90s, and the dominance of the 2000s.


With that said, I have watched almost every one of Kobe's games. I was 15 when the dude came into the game.. I remember I had friends that went to highschool with his girl.. I have been watching kobe play for more than half my life now. I sit back and think about that.. how fucking old i am now for one thing, but seriously that stat just amazes me. This dude has been in the NBA for half his full life, and I have gotten to watch him. Its like the truman show. All his ups and downs... 3 rings in a row, Colorado, 81 points.. missing the playoffs, having to play with Kwame, Cook, and Smush as starters, then rebuild and win 2 more..etc

I havent stressed on a game since about 15 games in.. I knew this year was junk after a 0-8 preseason, even when everyone said it was just preseason. This team is just not good. its top heavy and just doesnt have the roll players.. they are all on the clippers now. 

Im just sitting back and watching the dude i have watched since i was 15 STILL fuck shit up. Watching his foot work, and his crazy determination. He is towards the end of career. This era is almost over. Im just gonna sit back and enjoy it. 

So with that said, maybe that will help some of y'all.. there arent gonna be many like kobe again in my lifetime, and that dude is a huge inspiration. If you are struggling with the stress of the season, try this approach.  

I mean who knows, maybe the dude will play to 40... but if not, if you are true sports fan, its good to marvel in it and his accomplishments.

and as far as the Lakers organization goes.. IF Kobe retires.. you bet your ass half of the NBA will want to come to LA. EVERYONE is off the books, yes everyone.. fuck Dwight and his awful attitude and poor playing..  2005/06 is gonna be pretty interesting.

1351795860.0,113,self.lakers,12gyr6,My perspective of Coach Brown from sitting courtside against the Blazers 10/31/2012,bonytony21,128,15,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/12gyr6/my_perspective_of_coach_brown_from_sitting/,"I sat behind the scorer's table (called the ""courtside"" section, but actually 2nd row) last night.  If you see the highlights, I'm the Kobe jersey in the sea of red right at mid court.  I'll add some of my crappy iPhone pics when I get a chance.

EDIT: [Pictures!](http://imgur.com/a/Td8c6#0)

**In my opinion, Coach Brown is worthless.**  He doesn't seem to have any authority on the team.  When the guys were on the other end of the floor, he'll shout these really short, cryptic directions, and the players would sometimes look at him perplexed, then just carry on doing whatever they were doing.  The only direction I saw them actually react to was ""Line!"" when they had an out of bounds play, and that's something you learn to do in grade school.  

When the Lakers would make a bad play and then get caught fouling, they would turn to the ref and complain, but would also stare at Brown sometimes and say ""c'mon coach!"" like they were looking for some better direction.  

When Metta fouled out, he instantly went to the bench while the Blazers were shooting free throws.  I was watching Coach Brown stand there doing nothing for a minute until Gary Vitti (the trainer) finally came over and said to him ""You need to replace Metta.""

I've said it before, and it was definitely true last night as well:  The Princeton offense is great for a college team where you need to encourage ball movement.  However, we pulled off getting one of the best dribbling playmakers ever, and now we don't let him dribble.  Nash is just following orders and passing around, and Kobe is always going to be a black hole in that type of system, so at that point, the rotation stops and Nash watches from the sideline.

If you say ""at least he's a defensive coach"", I don't see the defense either.  We had trouble stopping penetration which has always been a problem, but the way the rotations worked, it seemed too easy for the Blazers to draw out both Pau and Dwight which led to short jumpers by big men, or open long range jumpers with Blazers in rebounding position.  A consistently good defensive team should strive to keep teams in the 80s.  We're allowing 107.5.

EDIT: 

A couple more things I wanted to say about Coach Brown that I was reminded about in comments:

* One of the biggest problems I saw from a direct coaching perspective in the first two games was the substitution pattern. We have 3 superstars (and Pau who's no slouch). So to have a team that could at least put up some points, you could put in Kobe + scrubs, Pau + any other of the big 3, or Nash and Dwight, and have plenty of rest for whoever's not involved. Brown spent a huge amount of time with Pau + 4 scrubs. They were just lost and Pau had to force the issue.

* As for the bench, I think that's another area where the coach and his system are responsible. If you have a system that works and that the players are used to, then players like Jamison, Meeks and Hill will be able to produce. Right now, they're just given the ball and told to score, and then they lose confidence when they fail. This may change as they get more comfortable with the system.

* As for Brown's credentials as a coach, this is what I said in comments:  I think the Cavs failures in the playoffs stem from him getting out-coached in a series, whereas in the regular season, you come less prepared, so having a talent like Lebron can take you far.  I assume he contributed in winning championships under Popovich, but as far as I've seen, he's still unproven as an elite coach.

**The good things I take from this game:**

* Dwight's free throws looked amazing.  Chuck Person's advice might have made a difference, though we'll see how it holds up (Shaq had some good FT games, too, but you know how that ended up).

* With no real offensive scheme, Dwight was able to get the ball on the block and create great shots/FTs.

* With Dwight being assertive with the ball and a threat without, Kobe doesn't need to jack up as many bad shots, so he ends up with open long range jumpers or decent drives to the basket (62% FG for the season).  

* If we keep losing like this, we might just get an early Christmas gift! (It's pink and has Coach Brown's name on it!)

* In person, Dwight still doesn't look in shape yet.  I think he'll start looking much better when he's back in full game shape.

**Side note:**
NBA refs are pretty damn awesome.  Bill Kennedy was the head ref.  Not only does he have massive guns, but he's such a professional.  He would give such clear and detailed information down to the scorers.  When Coach Brown complained about a foul on Howard, he explained it to him in a very fair manner, forcing to Brown shut up.  And then after every quarter, Kennedy would come to the scorers table with a smile saying ""great job guys!""  I can understand why replacement refs in sports would have a huge impact on the sport.",,False,,t5_2qhv6,1351882017.0,,logo,True,t3_12gyr6,http://www.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/12gyr6/my_perspective_of_coach_brown_from_sitting/,

Before we got Brown, my only thought was ""please don't hire him!"" In my opinion, he's not an elite coach. He was chosen over Adelman because he had credentials (Led the Cavs to the finals in 2007, and had a great record in recent years) and because he was cheaper ($4.5mil/year vs Adelman who made $6.9 mil/year with Hou). I gave him some time in the hopes that he would prove me wrong, but I didn't like what I saw, and it hasn't improved since.

**Defense:**

Coach is known for defense and won a championship as an assistant under Popovich. He seems to have an above-average defensive scheme. This helped us have decent defensive numbers last year, but against elite teams in a playoff series, he doesn't have a good defensive coaching history (100.5 OPA in 2009 against Boston, 103.7 OPA in 2008 against Orlando).

The 11-12 Lakers had decent defensive numbers, but struggled with consistency and also struggled against elite teams. I'll expand on playoffs and being out-coached later.

**Offense**

This is where Coach Brown has often been criticized, and for good reason. Lebron James is a beast. He may be the most athletically gifted player we've ever seen, and he's an excellent passer with great vision and unselfishness. He carried the regular season, and his teamplay made his role players very effective similar to other greats like Magic, Jordan, Nash, etc.  

Once you hit the playoffs, that's where having an elite coach really matters. Teams were prepared for facing Lebron, and it showed when he would find himself frustrated and unable to get his teammates involved in their playoff losses. The general play would involve putting the ball in Lebron's hands and standing back. Sometimes he's able to make a great play just through pure talent, but that isn't enough to win a title.

The 11-12 Lakers had offensive issues throughout the entire season. Kobe was able to score, but his scoring was relatively inefficient (43% FG vs 45.3% career and 30.3% 3PT vs 33.7% career). As much as I love Kobe, his team game will never be Lebron's. More of Kobe's scoring came from desperation, and the rest of the team's efficiency followed, especially in the playoffs (Pau 12.5 PPG in the playoffs). Our bench was terrible, but I'll expand on that later.

The fact that he decided to try the Princeton Offense shows that he understands that he's deficient in this area. I was looking forward to the Princeton Offense since it would force some ball movement, but that changed the day we signed Nash at which point it no longer made sense since Nash is a one-man facilitator.  

For those who say that Adelman runs the motion offense, and therefore would've had the same results, the big difference here is Adelman is a proven offensive coach who has been using the motion offense for many years. Coach Brown is trying it for the first time as a desperation move since he clearly understands that offense is his weak point. That experience would make a huge difference in your ability to make a system work. Phil's triangle takes a while to master, but he'd been doing it forever, and even when we screwed it up, you didn't see long stretches of games where the entire offensive scheme was ineffective like you do right now.

**Bench play**

The fans, the opposing fans, and the analysts like to point out that the Lakers' bench is horrible. It is clear it's not the deepest bench, but I believe this is more evidence of coaching failure rather than weak personnel.  

Benches for the last 5 championship seasons:

2009-2010: Odom, S. Brown, Farmar, Vujacic, Walton, Mbenga, Powell, Morrison

2008-2009: Odom, S. Brown, Farmar, Vujacic, Walton, Mbenga, Powell, Morrison, Radmanovic, Yue, Mihm

2001-2002: Shaw, Crispin, George, Hunter, Madsen, McCoy, Medvedenko, Penberthy, Richmond, Walker

2000-2001: Foster, George, Horry, Lue, Madsen, Medvedenko, Penberthy, Rider, Shaw

1999-2000: Celestand, Fisher, George, Harper, Horry, Jacobson, Knight, Lue, Salley, Shaw

Our bench:
Blake, Ebanks, Duhon, Hill, Jamison, Meeks, Morris, Sacre, Clark

We've had some great role players (Big Shot Rob, Shaw), some good contributions from aging veterans, and we have fond selective memories of great moments when certain guys stepped up (Brown, Farmar, Walton, Vujacic). However, especially looking at the recent back to back championships, our bench was never extremely deep. One of the coach's main jobs and one of the main goals of having a working offensive scheme is getting the bench to play effectively. Every team deals with this problem when the starters are on the bench. You have to give Phil and the triangle credit for getting decent contributions from the bench. Look at those same contributors and see how they've fared after Phil brought up their stock, and they moved to a new system. Saying that ""we're losing because our bench is terrible"" is not a valid excuse in my mind. A good coach makes the best with what he's got. The failure of our recent bench is evidence of subpar coaching.

**Playoff coaching**

As I mentioned in another thread, Coach Brown has shown that he can create a workable solution for his team which helps achieve a good regular season record. However, he hasn't shown the ability to adapt to the chess match that is a playoff series.

First, preparation is important. Brown's rotations showed a lack of foresight for the playoffs. Kobe's minutes peaked in 2005-2006 where he averaged 41 minutes per game at age 27. His minutes were still between 36-38 minutes in the next few years until his body began to have some major issues, at which point Phil managed to have him at 33.9 minutes/game. When Brown took over, I began to notice that he would keep Kobe in long stretches of the game, partially because his lack of offense required a creator, and Kobe was the only one capable, and partially because I think he's just doesn't see the big picture. Even with his experimental knee surgery rejuvenating him, he jumped back up to 38.5 minutes a game at age 33. I could remember a few of our comfortable wins, Brown would be pissed at the bench giving up part of a lead, so he would put the starters back in to prove a point. Often, the starters would close out the game, and then would get taken out with a minute or two remaining. These types of decisions may lead to little victories in attempting to motivate the bench or securing a win, but in the end, it may have hurt our chances for a ring.

Against OKC last season, both G2 and G4 were lost in the final seconds when Kobe made costly turnovers. I could give credit to the argument that Kobe is getting older, but all the more reason for the coach to prepare by not overworking Kobe in the regular season, and by having a system that doesn't depend on Kobe exerting himself just to get points.

When the Cavs got knocked out during Lebron's time, the team was just not able to operate as efficiently as the regular season because Rivers and Van Gundy came prepared, and Brown didn't adapt.  Lebron would just get hounded, and the rest of the team wasn't mentally prepared to step up and make plays. When your team just looks completely different from the team that excelled with less pressure, that's a good sign of bad coaching.

**Conclusion**

So when Kobe tells people to be patient and that things will improve, it is the exact right thing for him to say. However, it in no way means that he doesn't have his doubts. Kobe's shown a lot of frustration recently, and he's also resorted to playing hero-ball late since he doesn't trust his teammates in this system.

When Nash was interviewed against the Clippers, his answer to a question about the Princeton was something like ""I still haven't lost faith in this system"". When he was asked if he thought he should just run pick and rolls he smiled and said something like ""You're trying to set me up, but I won't fall for it."" Then he urged patience as expected. These things don't fill me with confidence.

The 0-8 preseason record for me is inconsequential, and if anything, the Lakers played decently well in those games, often leading until the 4th in which they would either not play the starters and lose (lack of a system for the bench), or they would lose the lead even with the starters (pointless overworking of the starters). The Lakers have never had a great record in preseason from what I remember, and I believe that's perfectly fine since they know it doesn't matter.

So far, we're 1-4, with our 1 win coming against Detroit who's horrible. They couldn't hit a jumper to save their lives, and they really didn't have the personnel to compete defensively.  Detroit is currently ranked last in Stein's power rankings. I give credit to the teams in our four losses for playing well, but it was especially discouraging that none of the losses were close.  In every case, we would fall to a double digit lead for most of the game. We would have stretches where we would cut it to single digits, but then we would just fall apart with turnovers and with a lack of defensive consistency.

I believe health, conditioning, and comfort with our system will help. However, I don't see that as enough to lift us to a title. Home court advantage is not the most crucial thing. However, a team's standing at the end of the regular season is usually a good sign of a team's general health looking toward the playoffs. Since our threepeat in 2000, no team has won the championship seeded lower than 3rd in their conference, and 5 times, it was a #1 seed that won. So as an indicator of championship potential, the regular season is important. If you can't get some sort of consistent flow in the regular season, chances are you aren't a champion. In our previous championship seasons, we've been a great team with occasional periods of funk. Starting the season 1-4 is a very ominous sign.

In conclusion, this isn't a kneejerk reaction. I don't want to waste another season with this talent. Let's move in the right direction today!",,False,,t5_2qhv6,1352400616.0,,logo,True,t3_12uhec,http://www.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/12uhec/the_desire_to_fire_coach_brown_is_not_a_kneejerk/,

You know what else he is?  I will rarely say this about a player but Dwight demands it.  

Dwight is a cancer.

We dodged a $120 million cancer bullet that would have left us gasping for air by the second year of the contract.

You give a massive contract like that to Dwight, and you'll be stuck with:

* a player whose post ""moves"" and offensive skill set look like they came from a cereal box flap yet demands to be the go-to scorer and complaining about touches.  Remember that running hook that Dwight loves so much?  It's so robotic and predictable that Marc Gasol swatted that shit like 5 times in a row and Dwight still kept trying it. 
* a player who passive-aggressively badmouths his teammates like he thinks we're all as oblivious as he is
* a player who responds to a 30 point game 3 loss by getting ejected in game 4 in just 20 minutes when in a position where he called himself the leader.  BTW, Kobe played 48mpg and exploded his achilles to give Dwight that opportunity
* “He gets the ball on offense, oh my God, he doesn't know what to do. It's usually a turnover, people come and take the ball from him or tie his arms up. Offensively, he doesn't get it. Hasn't made any progress. We (the Lakers, when Abdul-Jabbar was a special assistant coach) played them in '09, and when I saw him this past season, he was the same player.” - Kareem
* a player who shoots 50% from the free throw line, and when arguably the greatest free throw shooter in NBA history offers to help, he says he already knows how to shoot free throws
* a player who can't even stay out of foul trouble because he keeps getting offensive fouls trying to post up like a dancing inflatable man by flailing his arms around and hoping for a call when he really just can't post up
* a player who never takes accountability and keeps blaming his issues on other people and the coach when Kobe, Nash, and Pau were literally reinventing themselves mid-season while Dwight was still complaining about touches
* When Kobe offered to show him what it means to be a winner: ""I'm already a winner.""  LOL
* ""But at the end of the day, the reason we lost is not my free throws."" and yet Miami was a Ray Allen buzzer beater from not winning the championship this year.
* a player that requires an offense be built around him, a roster built around him, and for him to get the most touches to be at his most productive, yet becomes a liability anyway
* when his athleticism falters, he will have little fundamentals to carry him
* he has a back injury that remains a question mark and/or a convenient excuse for him to use when he has a bad game.  

After a win:

""I'm feeling healthier.  Back is feeling strong again.  Everyone touched the ball.""

After a loss:

""We didn't share the ball enough.  My back is not 100%.  I think it's around &lt;insert random % pulled out of ass here that changes every week&gt;.""

I'm not even salty.  I'm ecstatic.  I just want people to know that what happened was a blessing in disguise.  Even when we had him we were barely a playoff team.  If we suck and we end up in the lottery, fine.  We actually have a draft pick next year.  If we make the playoffs, fine.  We wouldn't have needed him to do it.

But I'm sick and fucking tired of Pau being treated poorly. Nobody seems to fucking get it. If he went to any team with a competent coach, he would become the best offensive center in the NBA (Again). Yes. I mean what I just said. 

And yes: CENTER CENTER CENTER CENTER CENTER.

He's not a god damn power forward. He's just not. So stop trying to make him one Pringles! I truly believe that he's just as valuable as Dwight is. At least for the next 2 years or so...

Phil knew how to use this brilliant specimen of basketball ingenuity... why the fuck can't fucking Pringles figure it out!?

There are rumors that phil may be rehired to keep D12 in LA. As far as I'm concerned, let Dwight leave, but bring Phil back. We'll win with Pau. Why? Because the best mother fucking offensive center in the NBA is a god damn threat. He's been a chess piece in a fucking checker game for the last two years. I fucking weep for how much Pau could have done for this team had we only utilized him correctly.

Pau is my fucking boy, and if he leaves, whatever team he joins will become my second favorite.

You lakers fans who hate on him are fucking traitors.

**EDIT:** *TL;DR* from Hulk Hogan: **Even if Dwight leaves we still have Kobe, Pau, Metta, and Nash. People are focusing too much on last season. Resigning dwight has to be the priority but if we can't then blowing the team up is not the next best option. Having pau as the center and finding free agents to work with him and kobe and nash is.

**Q: Can the Lakers straight-up sign Chris Paul?**

A: No, they cannot. They are over the cap limit of $58.044 million. Even in a case where Dwight Howard does not re-sign and Metta World Peace is amnestied, the Lakers would still be a significant figure over the salary cap.

**Q: Wait... the NBA has a salary cap?**

A: Crazy, right?

**Q: Can they even offer Chris Paul a contract?**

A: Yes, they can. Their mid-level exception is available, per year. Because LA is over the cap and paid luxury taxes last year, the maximum MLE they can offer a free agent comes out to roughly $9 million/3 years. Alternatively, the Lakers can offer Paul the league minimum, roughly $480,000. Would the best point guard in the NBA settle for either of these figures? No.

**Q: But wait! You can sign over the salary cap and just pay more in luxury taxes, no?**

A: You cannot sign a free agent to a contract that would place you above the salary cap, unless it's worth the league minimum. It is possible to exceed the salary cap if a backloaded contract pushes you over (as seen in the current Lakers roster).

**Q: Okay, then the Lakers need to clear up space to sign both Dwight and CP3. How about they trade Pau away, amnesty Metta, kill Steve Nash and blame it on Jason Richardson, etc...**

A: Because of Kobe Bryant's $30 million he makes next year which already takes up half of the cap, you are forced to pick your poison. Both D12 and CP3 are going to want max contracts. The max contract in the NBA pays $17,177,795 in its first year. Yes, they can take less money to pair together like LeBron, Bosh and Wade, but let's say you amnesty Metta and somehow trade Pau for picks and a bag of basketballs. There's Steve Nash's contract. There's Jordan Hill's contract. There's Steve Blake's contract. There's Chris Duhon's contract (though he'll likely be bought out). So essentially, you can have one but not both.

Now, if you amnesty Kobe, the scenario changes a little bit...

**Q: Is there any possible avenue in which the Lakers can have a starting five with CP3, Kobe, and Dwight in it?**

A: Yes. But it's a stretch. Per the 2011 Collective Bargaining Agreement, teams $4 million over the luxury tax threshold (roughly $70 million) cannot acquire players via sign-and-trade. The Lakers, even without signing Dwight Howard or any other players next year, stand at $8 million over the threshold. Therefore, the only way for the Lakers to have all three of Chris Paul, Dwight Howard, and Kobe Bryant on the same team next year for max contracts is to trade Pau Gasol to a team with enough cap space to absorb Pau Gasol's $19,285,850 for a trade exception without incurring any salary in return in order to sink the Lakers far beneath the luxury tax threshold.

Then, LA would have to acquire CP3 to a max contract via sign-and-trade with the Clippers. Obviously, they could put together some sort of package of expiring contracts plus the trade exception in order to make the pieces fit. Again, under the new CBA, you are not allowed to a bird-rights max deal, so it would have to be for the standard max of $17.7 million with 4.5% annual raises. Finally, LA could sign Dwight to a bird rights max deal.

An alternate scenario would be like the one above, but instead of trading Gasol away, the Lakers could trade Nash away without incurring any salary. This would push them down to $69 million, just under the luxury tax threshold, then put together a sign-and-trade with the Clippers surrounding Pau Gasol and Chris Paul. 

Again, it's *possible*, but not probable at all.

**Q: So you're telling me there's a chance?**

A: Yes, but it's slim. The chance of shipping Pau Gasol to a team with $20 million in cap space for next-to-nothing when they are at full liberty to pursue a big name free agent is almost impossible. The chance of putting together a viable package to send to the Clippers is almost impossible. The chances of the Clippers actually okaying a deal which would cement the Lakers as the top dogs of Staples for the next several years is almost impossible. 

With the second scenario, the chance of trading an injury-riddled Steve Nash whose contract doesn't expire anytime soon to a team for nothing is almost impossible. And although Gasol could pair well with Griffin, the Clippers have $10 million a year invested in DeAndre Jordan and would not want to pay that much for a backup center. Plus all the hoopla about not wanting to help the Lakers.

Personally, I feel like Chris Paul will remain a Clipper under a new coach. Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan are the two best complementary pieces available for him, CP3 can obtain the maximum amount of dollars, and he has cemented himself as the leader of the Clipper franchise and has already shown that he has weight when it comes to front office decisions.

**tl;dr: There's a salary cap. The Lakers are over it. By a lot. CP3 won't be in purple and gold next season unless Mitch Kupchak tweaks with the Association Settings**

1376581688.0,73,self.lakers,1kfaft,Kobe and Jordan: A Study in Efficiency,Paladinoras,89,16,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/1kfaft/kobe_and_jordan_a_study_in_efficiency/,"If there's anything people believe about Kobe, is that Jordan is miles ahead of Kobe Bryant, because of the 5% gap in their shooting percentages. Jordan is the efficient, big-time scorer, while Kobe is the inefficient ballhog who shoots his team out of games. (Something that has been proven factually incorrect...hell, Kobe shoots better when the team is down)

That difference, (and a whole lot of Nike marketing), is what drives people to believe that Kobe is barely a top 10 player in the NBA, while Jordan is the unanimous GOAT. But...is that truly the case?

An interesting statistical tid-bit that most people haven't realized yet, is that Jordan has shot the ball 236 more times in his career compared to Kobe, despite playing 5 less years. 

http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jordami01.html

http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/bryanko01.html

This can mainly be attributed to Jordan's ridiculous 22.9 FGA, tops in league history. Kobe, in comparison, shoots a ""paltry"" 19.6 FGA over his career. 

Here's the thing though, despite the 4.3% difference in FG%, the difference in total number of points between the two is....675. 

That's it. 

If we take into account Kobe's average efficiency per shot taken (PPWS), 31617(PTS)/24301(FGA) = 1.301 Points Per FGA, that means that Kobe will need 675/1.301 = 519 shots to equal Jordan. 

What does this all mean? Well it means that over their whole careers, the difference between Kobe and Jordan's scoring output, is literally 283 shots. This means that had Kobe made 0.23 more shots a game over his career, he would have the exact same efficiency as Jordan. Are you really telling me that 0.23 made shots a game, is the only thing separating Kobe from Jordan? The difference between the 10 - 15th spots in the greatest pantheon of NBA players, and the GOAT? 

People might say that my logic is faulty, but fact is, if you take into account eFG%, and TS%, Kobe's numbers (48.7% eFG, 55.5% TS) isn't that far off from Jordan's (50.9% eFG, 56.9% TS). When you take into account their output over their whole careers, it's surprising that with Jordan's reputation as the greatest scorer in NBA history, that Kobe is breathing right down his neck. 

In fact, if Kobe returns and plays out of his mind...there's a wild, outside chance that he surpasses Jordan's output with LESS SHOTS. (Note: This involves both a Steph Curry-like 3 point barrage, AND James Harden-like foul drawing ability.)

Another fun tidbit: Had Kobe taken the same amount of shots as the great Michael Jordan (22.9 - 19.6, so 3.3 more shots attempted per game over their careers), Kobe's career scoring average would be 25.5  + 3.3 * 1.301 = 25.5 + 4.293 = 29.8 PPG

0.3 PPG, that's apparently the gap between Kobe and Jordan. 

Ultimately, do I think Kobe is a better player than Jordan? Nah, not really. Jordan did manage to accomplish more things than Kobe, and win more individual accolades. (Whether Kobe's lack of MVPs and other awards is due to media influence or personal accomplishment is another matter entirely). In their primes, I'd take Jordan more times than not. Defensively, Jordan reached a level of dominance Kobe has only managed in spurts. 

But offensively? It's a lot closer than you would imagine. I'm willing to go so far as to say that Kobe is the best offensive weapon this league has ever seen. He has sustained a level of offensive production most players can only dream of, let alone guards.",,False,,t5_2qhv6,False,,,True,t3_1kfaft,http://www.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/1kfaft/kobe_and_jordan_a_study_in_efficiency/,

If we're looking for a speedy spark off the bench that can get to into the lane and get hot from three, Bynum's our man. He's a lot like Nate Robinson in terms of size and energy. He's also a tremendous athlete.


**Austin Daye PF | 6-11 | 200 | Age 25**
Austin Daye was the 15th pick of the 2009 NBA Draft. He spent 3 years in Detroit stuck on the bench behind Greg Monroe, Charlie V and Jason Maxiel where he didn't really get the playing time to prove himself. He is a prototypical stretch four with a great three point shot, much like a skinnier Channing Frye. He would fit perfectly in a D'Antoni system. He has potential, but may need to bulk up his Tayshawn-like frame. Huge upside. With little interest from other teams, he could be acquired for the minimum, leaving the MMLE open for another player, perhaps a SF.


**Lamar Odom PF | 6-10 | 230 | Age 33**
Latest news is that [the Lakers have reached out to Lamar](http://www.cbssports.com/nba/blog/eye-on-basketball/22665100/report-lakers-have-reached-out-to-lamar-odom). Truth is he has been down right horrible in his 2 years away from the Lakers. He has seemed unmotivated. Perhaps reuniting with Kobe will ignite a fire in Lamar. If he signs with the Lakers, perhaps he'd be the starting power forward over Jordan Hill. An intriguing stretch four who would fit in with D'Antoni's philosophy. 


**Nick Young SG/SF | 6-7 | 210 | Age 28**
When he gets hot, he's hard to stop. An X factor type player. He averages 11ppg over his career, so you know he's going to get buckets. Would fit in great with the second unit, or perhaps starting at the SF. He's young and athletic, but his defense and decision making are the only questions. He has potential, just needs focus. With Kobe mentoring him, I think he could develop really well.


**Carlos Delfino SF | 6-6 | 230 | Age 30**
Delfino could potentially start at the SF if Metta is amnestied. He's a career 36% three point shooter, and is another one of those players who has the ability to go on wild hot streaks. He's a decent defender and can do more than just shoot. Good option for the MMLE.


**Rodrigue Beaubois PG | 6-2 | 185 | Age 25**
Mark Cuban was in love with this kid, but he never lived up to the hype in Dallas, partly because of an injury. Perhaps he can flourish with the Lakers. He's very quick and athletic and has a good wing span which makes him a good defender. His playmaking is not the best, but he excels in transition. These are all things the Lakers could use. Especially the speed.


**Wes Johnson SF | 6-7 | 205 | Age 25**
Former #4 pick. He's inconsistant, probably because he lacks motivation. If anything can get him focused, its the pressure of playing in LA with Kobe Bryant. When engaged, he's a great slasher, he can knock it down from 3 and can defend. He's incredibly athletic. I'd take my chances, what is there to lose?


**Reggie Williams SF | 6-6 | 205 | Age 26**
Who? [This guy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NzpWH7IleU). He is a natural born scorer and has developed a great 3 point shot. He's a lefty with long arms. Last year he was stuck behind MKG in Charlotte. I'd get him for the minimum just to see what he can do. We desperately need to fill out the roster, and I don't think he's in demand. Who knows, he could turn out for us.


**Sasha Vujacic SG | 6-7 | 205 | Age 29**
Still on the good side of 30, Sasha would be great to have back in the locker room. He gives us shooting and that pesky defense. He's also an undderated playmaker. Personally, I think he would thrive in D'Antoni's offense. I could actually see him breaking out, and potentially becoming a starter at the two, with Kobe slipping down to the three. Maybe I just love Sasha too much. No-homo. But, really, homo. But no. On a more serious note, we could easily get him for the vets min. [Mutual interest apparently](http://fansided.com/2013/07/02/nba-free-agency-sasha-vujacic-wants-to-play-for-los-angeles-lakers/).


**Wayne Ellington SG | 6-4 | 200 | Age 25**
I saw quite a few Cavs games last season, and I have to say, Ellington was a pleasant surprise. He can really shoot the three. Close to 40% for his career. 


**Anthony Morrow SG | 6-5 | 210 | Age 27**
Career 42% 3pt shooter. Need I say more? He reminds me a lot of Meeks, so don't know if we want two Meeks'. One is enough I'd say.


**Corey Brewer SF | 6-9 | 188 | Age 27**
He's a decent defender due to the fact that he's pretty long, and can knock down the spot up three. Also has the athleticism we require. Would be a good pick up, but I think he'll end up somewhere else being paid more than he should be.


**Alan Anderson SG/SF | 6-6 | 220 | Age 30**
A tough defender. If we want defense, this guy is underrated and can really get under a player's skin. He's also a good shooter from the outside and mid range. I remember watching him play against us last season and I immediately put him on my radar. He's not spectacular, but a good role player in my opinion. It would be an interesting pick up.


My prediction: Nick Young takes the MMLE. Wes Johnson, Austin Daye, Lamar Odom and Sasha Vujacic sign on for the minimum. I think Delfino, Will Bynum and Corey Brewer will be snapped up for a price we can't afford.

2013-14 Lakers

Below are predicted scenarios where the Lakers can pass GSW, UTAH, or HOU. If any of these teams get above +0 against the predicted pace, it's bad for us. If everyone is at 0, it means we're on track for the playoffs. If we go into the negative, it's bad. If they go into the negative, awesome. First letter is actual result (W/L), second is predicted result.

This thread will be updated daily and once a week I'll do a weekly update.

**Summary of the week**: As excellent as last week was, this week was even better. By Record, the Lakers went 3-1 while Golden State went 2-3, Utah Freefell 1-3 while Houston is the only team we didn't gain ground on with a matching 3-1. This was an amazing week not just for the clutch performance by LA, but because both Golden State and Utah dropped key games to bad teams (PHI, MIL, CLE). With an extremely tough stretch coming up for Utah (New York twice, Memphis, Oklahoma, Houston &amp; San Antonio), the Lakers are poised to be in the 8th slot by the end of next week with a legit chance to move up to 7th. With our win over Atlanta we've even given ourselves a little breathing room to be able to take a bad loss somewhere down the stretch - a get out of jail free card that LA somehow managed to avoid spending this week on New Orleans &amp; Toronto. For those scoring at home, Utah's 5.5 ASG lead on LA has been cut to half a game in just two weeks, and we've still got over a month to go.

**We Gives thanks to...**: Kobe ""Are you fucking kidding me"" Bryant, who somehow had an even better week than last week, and performed so well down the stretch against Toronto that even hardened TO fans gave him a nod of respect after the game... Rudy Gay &amp; Eric Gordon for missing every important shot down the stretch... Josh Smith for not catching that last ball cleanly &amp; telling interviewers Dwight would probably stay in LA afterwards.  Jarrett Jack for laying a big egg in Philly and costing Golden State a precious win against a bad team. Orlando for trading J.J. Redick to Milwaukee, who must still have a little love for Dwight cause he dropped 8 points in overtime against the Jazz to put them away for us (special shout out to Marvin Williams, Randy Foye &amp; Earl Watson, who all started for Utah that game and combined for... 0 points). Kyrie Irving, for his usual clutchness against Utah in the 4th, dropping a near triple double and helping beat them by 3. Oh, And Marco fucking Bellinelli for the game winning 3 against Utah... jesus, Utah could've easily gone 4-0 this week and LA could've easily gone 0-4... lets just thank the basketball gods in general for letting 6 1 to 6 point games swing in our favour in one week. 

**Lakers predicted finish** : 20-8 to finish at 45-37

**Actual Finish (So far)** : 9-3

**+/- Against predicted pace** : +2

**Games out of 8th** : 0

**Schedule Strength** : 10 of lakers last 19 games are against current playoff teams. 4 of those 10 are against elite playoffs teams (&gt;60% win %). They have 7 games against basement teams (&lt;40% win %) and 8 against mid-range teams (40-60%). 9 are at home and 10 on the road.

**Analysis** : Lakers have done exactly what they needed to do through 2 weeks. They've taken care of business against every team around their level and below, and haven't dropped a bad game yet. They still have some long road trips coming up and some tough games, but they've now caught Utah and Utah's schedule is MUCH tougher down the stretch. Barring another major slump, Laker fans can legitimately start feeling like this is a playoff team and start worrying about how the hell we're going to dodge OKC and SAS and get that dream match against the clippers.

**Weekly Update**: For the cynical fans out there, this is about as ugly and close to 0-4 as a 3-1 week could've possibly been. In fact, over the 4 games we were a -8, Beating Atlanta by 1 points, NOH by 6, TOR by 2 and losing to OKC by 17. And despite Dwight playing really well, there are still serious we-are-screwed-in-the-playoffs issues with our defense. The way we clamped down on NOH in the 4th offers a bit of hope, but seriously... this week was ugly. From a fan standpoint though, I can't remember the regular season ever having a week this exciting for LA... talk about clutch performances. Dwight's making huge defensive plays. Kobe's been in god mode, and Nash seems to hit every big 3 we need out of him in the 4th. This coming week is going to be a tough one, with 3 solid eastern playoff teams - Chicago, Atlanto, and Indiana. If we can go 2-2 we'll be in great shape, and thanks to a great two weeks, even 1-3 won't kill us. 

**Player of the Week**: I honestly wish I could put Dwight Howard here. He hasn't been complaining, he's been working hard on the boards, has had long stretches of the dominant defense we need from him, and has even been more productive on his hook shots. He's setting great screens, working hard to get free and getting LA lots of easy buckets. His performance down the stretch against New Orleans was filthy good and it's a shame he's overshadowed by Kobe. But as with most of his Legacy, Kobe's not the feel good story - he just takes the crown by force. Here are some numbers over the last 4 games: 36.75 PPG, 5.5 RPG, 7.5 APG, 44.8% from 3, 51.7% from the field, and one of those random nonsense records - oldest player ever to drop back-to-back 40/10 games. One of the Sloan basketball articles detailed how good players tend to get better in the clutch because they exert more effort and put their body on the line more down the stretch... and how Kobe is one of the guys who plays at his highest level from behind in the 4th. Talk about a performance for the ages to validate that research. Even the biggest Kobe fans didn't see this week coming. 3 threes in 2 minutes to force overtime, and the game winning dunk? Kobe's in playoff mode a month earlier than usual and it's awesome to watch, lets hope that intensity pushes this team to be at its peak as it hits the playoffs.

**Daily Update** : Rough night for the Lakers all around. Nights like these are why I created this set of predictions - to remind us that even when things don't break our way, we've still in good shape. And we are still in excellent shape. We can even drop the next one in Indiana and be totally fine - as long as we take care of the three scrubs after that. Still, winning any of these games would've been a huge boost to our chase for 6th seed... and with Josh Smith out, it feels like a blown opportunity. This was a legitimately bad game for Kobe &amp; Nash and we got killed whenever Dwight was out with fouls - Dwight's +10 compared to a bunch of (-) across the board says it all.

**Golden State Warriors predicted finish** : 15-15 to finish 45-37

**Actual Finish (So far)** : 7-7

**+/- Against predicted pace** : -1

**Games Ahead of Lakers** : 3 (6.5 before All-Star break)

**Schedule Strength** : 8 of their final 19 are against playoff teams, 4 against elite teams, 7 against basement dwellers, 8 against mid-range teams. 13 of 19 are at home.

**Analysis** : Golden State has a nice little home stand coming up against the east, but will face some challenging games against Milwaukee, New York and Chicago. Lakers are now setting their eyes on GSW who have been struggling despite great games from Curry. GSW likely overachieved the first half of the season and Bogut regaining his form from several years ago is the only thing that could make this team a real threat. As is, they're a pile of nice shooters and bad defenders. That said, their closing stretch doesn't have many elite teams left on it, so if they can regain their form they still have enough of a cushion to hold LA off.

**Weekly Update**: This will go down as a rough week for Golden State, particularly their loss in Philly. Win's over Toronto and Sacramento were expected, but losing to Houston puts them in serious jeopardy of conceding 6th seed to Houston, not the mention the Lakers creeping up on them. And I'm sure LA isn't the only team looking to avoid San Antonio and Oklahoma. These guys are fighting with a lot more success than Utah is though, as Like LAL, GSW took care of business in the 4th against both SAC and TOR in games they were in real danger of losing. 

**Player of the Week**: It's close, but I'm going to give this week to Klay Thompson, as he basically matched Curry's production all week and hit the game winning 3 against Sacramento. On the week he put down 21.6PPG, 4.6 RPG, and 3.2 APG on 50% from 3 (20/40) and 100% from the line. 

**Daily Update** : What is there to say? Detroit is really bad and Golden State whomped them. Curry had one of his blazing nights, 31 and 8 on 17 shots including 5/7 from 3. Jack tore it up off the bench (19 points on 11 shots) and Lee chipped in 20/15/5. Now lets see how Golden State can do against stiffer competition these next two games.

**Incomplete** :CHI(X-L), @HOU(X-L), @NOH(X-W), @SAS(X-L), WAS(X-W), LAL(X-L), SAC(X-W), POR(X-L), NOH(X-W), @PHX(X-W), UTA(X-L), MIN(X-L), OKC(X-L), @LAL(X-L), SAS(X-W), @POR(X-W)

**Utah Jazz predicted finish** : 13-15 to finish 43-39

**Actual Finish (So far)** : 3-8

**+/- Against predicted pace** : -1

**Games Ahead of Lakers** : -.5 (5.5 before ASG)

**Schedule Strength** : 11 of 20 games against playoff teams, 9 against elite teams, 6 against basement dwellers and 5 against mid-range teams. 12 of 23 at home.

**Analysis** : Well, Utah has lost 1 out of every 4 games since the all star break and they were playing the softest part of their remaining schedule, which was the hardest of the four teams. You do the math. Unless something drastic happens, I expect Utah to tumble straight out of the playoff race over the next two weeks, and for the remaining 3 teams to be fighting for seeds down the stretch.

**Weekly Update**: I'm starting to think Utah doesn't WANT to make the playoffs. They start the week by drubbing Charlotte by 30 - a team so bad they are on pace to hit 50 losses before league leader San Antonio hits 50 wins (and also set the standard for futility with a -10.7 point differential, clearly outpacing Oklahoma's +9.6) then they proceed to lose to Milwaukee, Cleveland and Chicago, all in the 4th/overtime. This could've easily been a 4-0 week for Utah and I think it will turn out to be the week that breaks their playoff chances.

**Player of the Week**: Lets give it to Enes Kanter. With Jefferson and Millsap in and out of the lineup, Kanter put down 17 and 10.5 boards on the week, including a 22/23 game in their one win. If I was giving out a boob of the week it would go to Earl Watson, who started against Charlotte and Milwaukee and scored 0 points against both, then came off the bench vs the cavs to drop another 0 points... and was then given a DNP vs chicago.

**Daily Update** : Another expected loss - looks like Utah emptied their bench early after getting blown out in the first half, and ended up competing over the second half. Didn't stop OKC from blowing em out by 23, as Westbrook and Durant put in a cool 28 &amp; 29 minutes before resting up for tougher teams. By the end of the week Utah should be competing more with the Blazers and Dallas than us.

**Complete** : GSW(W-W), @LAC(L-L), BOS(L-L), ATL(L-L) | CHA(W-W), @MIL(L-W), @CLE(L-L), @CHI(L-L) | @NYK(L-L), DET(W-W), @OKC(L-L)

**Incomplete** :MEM(X-L), NYK(X-W), @HOU(X-L), @SAS(X-L), @DAL(X-W), PHI(X-W), PHX(X-W), @POR(X-L), BRK(X-L), POR(X-W), DEN(X-L), NOH(X-W), @GSW(X-W), OKC(X-L), MIN(X-W), @MIN(X-W), MEM(X-L)

**Houston Rockets predicted finish** : 15-12 to finish 44-38

**Actual Finish (So far)** : 6-4

**+/- Against predicted pace** : -1

**Games Ahead of Lakers** : 1.5 (3.5 before ASG)

**Schedule Strength** : 8 of 19 games against playoff teams, 6 against elite teams, 9 
against trash and 4 against mid-range teams. 12 of 19 at home

**Analysis** : Well, Houston has gotten a lot of the middle teams out of the way, and now has a big pile of easy games with a sprinkle of very tough games left. Even if they drop every game against the good teams left, they still have a very solid chance of going 12-7, keeping themselves well out of range of LA. This week opens with a breezey back to back against phoenix and then Minnesota. At the end of the week things start to get interesting as they face rivals GSW and UTA in consecutive games. Next week if the only really tough stretch for Houston. By the end of that week, Houston will have either collapsed or be completely out of reach for LA.

**Weekly Update**: Houston once again was the only team to keep pace with LA. They won all the games they had to win, including an assertive 4th quarter win over standings rival Golden State. Loss to Dallas at home was no big deal, and Houston looks poised to entrench itself in the 6th seed, provided it can assert it's dominance over Utah and Golden State late next week, games that will put them permanently ahead in the standings and seal the tie breakers.

**Player of the Week**: I'm going to give it to Chandler Parsons, who has emerged as James Harden's Klay Thompson to Stephen Curry - he doesn't handle the ball as much or run the offense, but he shoots lights out and frequently matches or surpasses Harden's point production while playing solid D. This week Parsons put down 25.5 PPG on a RIDICULOUS 20 for 30 from 3 (66.6%) and 67.8% from the field. 

**Daily Update** : So they beat Phoenix at home - who cares, they already managed to blow the roadie against them earlier in the week. Really this night was bad for lakers in the standings, but there weren't any upsets of games we needed teams to lose. Houston has a very easy schedule period, and if they slip up at all, they're in trouble. They had their way in this one though - all starters in double figures and over +20 and most of them got to rest after 26-28 minutes of play time. That's okay phoenix, you already did more than we expected of you. And they STILL have two more games against each other.

**Complete** : OKC(W-L), @BRK(W-L), @WAS(L-W), MIL(L-W) | @ORL(W-W), DAL(W-W), @DAL(L-L), @GSW(W-W) |@PHX(L-W), PHX(W-W)

**Incomplete** :MIN(X-W), GSW(X-W), UTA(X-W), CLE(X-W), SAS(X-L), IND(X-L), @MEM(X-L), LAC(X-L), ORL(X-W), @SAC(X-W), @POR(X-L), @DEN(X-L), PHX(X-L), MEM(X-L), SAC(X-W), @PHX(X-W), @LAL(X-L)

**Tie Breakers As per request** :

* Summary: Utah &gt; Lakers, Houston &gt; Golden State all the rest TBD over the last chunk of the season.

I'm also going to make the assumption that Utah is our main competitor for the #8 spot.

Criteria: Clear favorite (6.5 points+), Slight favorite (3-6), Close game (2.5 to -2.5), Slight underdog (-3 to -6), Clear underdog (-6.5-)

-----

Clear favorite: vs MIN, vs TOR, vs SAC, @SAC, @ORL, vs NOH, vs WAS (7)

Slight favorite: @NOH (b2b), @MIN, vs DAL, @PHX (b2b), vs GSW, vs HOU (6)

Close game: vs ATL, vs CHI, @GSW, @MIL (b2b) (4)

Slight underdog: vs MEM, @POR (b2b), vs SAS (3)
 
Clear underdog: @OKC, @IND, @ATL (b2b), @LAC (4)

-----

If we win our clearly favored games at 75% rate, Slight favored at 66.7%, close games at 50%, slight underdog at 33.3% and clear underdog at 25%... we are projected 13.25 wins. A 13-11 record to finish the season at .500. Hollinger has us at 14-10 to finish

Since we’ve lost the tie breaker to Utah, we are going to need to go 16-8 to beat out Hollinger’s Utah prediction for a playoff spot.

How do we get there? The most realistic way I see the Lakers getting is if we TAKE CARE OF BUSINESS. If we win 100% of our Clearly favorite games (their not great, you can see the list) and 75% of our Slightly favored games, while keeping the other numbers the same we are projected 15.5 wins. This is actually quite forgiving because we’d only have to split 2/ 4 of our “Close games”. Win 1/3 of our “Slight underdog” games and 1/4 of our “Clearly underdog” games.

So, it’s not so bad that we lost to DEN. We lost to a team we were clearly underdogs to (7 point underdogs and smart money was on Den). In fact, I’d argue we’ve actually made ground, despite this loss, due to Utah losing to a team they should have beat. Ty Celtics?

-----

TL;DR: If we thoroughly, and mean thoroughly demolish the teams we are favored against we should still make the playoffs despite losing against most of the tougher teams on our schedule.

Also, I'll update this periodically

&gt;Well the other night when the Lakers were in town, yes we all know how many fans of theirs were there so let’s not go into that again because of what I am about to say.
&gt;
&gt;At half time Dwight was one of the first players out of the locker room for shoot around, he stood in the tunnel and watched the Red Panda Acrobat do her thing and gave her a standing ovation when she left.
&gt;
&gt;Anyway after she exited the floor Dwight came onto the court and got a ball from a ball boy, who btw he shook his hand and thanked him. He then took a couple of jumpers when someone yelled something to him from over by where McKey sits at games. Dwight pointed at them and they both laughed that person then came over &amp; he and Howard shook hands and hugged so I assume he knew the guy. Dwight turns to walk away when he spots a little man jumping up and down in the 3rd row. Kid was probably anywhere from 8-10 and yes he was wearing a Lakers Howard jersey. Dwight stops in his tracks and walks over to the kid and throws him the ball. I actually thought he was giving the kid the basketball to keep as he walked toward the aisle with it but he then turned and walked to the court where Dwight let him come on the floor and shoot three shots. Afterwards he and the kid slap five and the kid floats (because he was just so damned happy) back to his seat with his Mom (at least I think it is his Mom) who has been taking photo’s and is now yelling “Thank you” to Howard.
&gt;
&gt;I’ve been going to games since 1985 &amp; I can tell you that I have never seen a superstar player so fan friendly and it’s just a real shame that he is now a villain for what he did to the Magic.

When one of these happens, you have to take a drink from your beer/cocktail. We've taken the KCAL broadcast in consideration as well. Most of these are silly/fun but here's what we have so far:

1. Kobe bites his jersey
2. An audible grunt/groan from Gasol
3. Stu Lantz speaks as if he's the player himself (example: So Bynum says ""I'm gonna ______ ..."")
4. Bill McDonald uses a catchphrase (SHAKE N BAKE)
5. Kobe does a pump fake
6. Sessions or Goudelock throws a floater
7. Whenever you catch a pretty close glimpse of the courtside Asian lady
8. Bynum misses a free throw (this is an older rule)
9. When someone commentating jumbles up Metta's name (World Metta Peace, Peace World, etc) + also if they accidentally say any part of ""Ron Artest"" when trying to describe him in the present.
10. One drink for every celebrity they identify on TV before Jack.
11. Bynum gets called for travelling
12. Josh McRoberts alley oop slam
13. Bynum's jersey gets untucked
14. Every time there's about to be a jump ball, all players must yell ""Jump!""
15. During a replay when the announcer says,""(Insert name here)...SPLASSSH""
16. Any player makes a toe-on-the-line long two pointer.
17. Blake shoots a three

We have more rules but I cannot recall them right now since we've never actually put this on paper. I'll amend the post with suggestions :D

*Update:* Lakers have won the game by a score of 113-102.  Fantastic team game (28 assists) tonight by Los Angeles.

*Dave McMenamin was saying this is the best two-game stretch of Blake's career.*  I might have to agree. He's had *nine* three-pointers in the past two games. Certainly some of his best performances in a Laker uniform. He's playing with a ton of confidence, too.

**Steve Blake:** 16 pts (6-11 fg, 4-7 from beyond the arc), 5 reb, 8 assists.

**Antawn Jamison:** 27 pts (8-14 fg, 5-8 from beyond the arc), 9 reb, 1 assist.

Amazing bench performance; 43 points between the two of them.  35 minutes each, which I'm willing to bet is close to season highs for both of them. And all of this without Kobe. Incredible.

I'm not sure what's up with Pau or how soon he'll be back, but if LA can get production like this, they'll have a good shot of going deep in the playoffs. I don't think they'll be able to maintain a 55%+ FG percentage, but key players certainly stepped up tonight in a big way.

Where the hell is your short term memory, guys?

**MWP should not start:** You realize the man had several 20 point games in the preseason and is probably the second best defender on our team except for Dwight, right? How the hell do you guys forget these things so quickly? I know the ball stops in his hands sometimes, but it's just because he's still a bit lost in the new system like everyone else on the floor.

**Fire Mike Brown:** Huh? Why? He got us to the second round of the playoffs last year after coming into a short season, which is exactly the same place Phil Jackson got us with MORE TALENT. And more importantly, why are you more qualified to make this assessment than the Lakers' front office? Have some faith in the men who have millions riding on Mike Brown's success.

**Get rid of the Prinston offense:** but... we've had 3 games......... I'm personally sick of the same damn pick-and-roll offense. I want the Lakers to have an edge. I want them thinking outside of the box. Innovation, man. Give it time; It pays off.

I swear to fuckin' hell, man. Some Lakers fans must have the short term memory of a 50 year old boxer. I'm super excited about what's to come. All y'all need to take a fuckin' Xanax and let the best franchise in the NBA do some work.

**Edit: from my comment below regarding our bench;** I think our bench is going to be REALLY good in a few months. Wayyyyy too much talent there to write them off as bad. Meeks, Jamison and Hill are 3 solid ass players who will find their rhythm together very soon. Ebanks is also pretty decent. They've never played together and they're still lost, just like the starters, except they're getting ~12 minutes a night to find a rhythm while our starters are getting ~36.

Here are some things I picked up on that I don't think I would have just sitting at home:

-Despite it being Warriors' arena, half of the fans had to be Laker fans. Although chants of Beat LA were definitely stronger, there was definitely one point where ""Let's Go Lakers!"" chant become pretty prominent. There were A LOT of disgruntled Warriors fans.

-Seeing Kobe move the way he did was extremely impressive in person. Compared to anyone else on the floor except for maybe one or two of Metta's spin moves, Kobe looked completely above the rest. It didnt really feel like he took 41 shots in person. It felt like most of his shots were necessary or almost as if I'd rather have him take the shot than the other players in that moment. His circus shots were even more ridiculous than when watching the replays. He truly is a force that is going to be missed when he is gone.

-The alley-oop from Nash to Kobe completely transformed the energy of the crowd. For awhile it felt like the Lakers were going to turn in another disappointment, but that dunk electrified the arena and you could really sense the Lakers gaining confidence after that.

-Steve Nash when he was on the bench was the first out there on the floor beside Sacre to greet and high five his teammates during a timeout. It's great seeing him be such a leader to the team.

-Chris Duhon, despite his assists, seemed really worthless out there.I thought he was somewhat of an improvement over Blake but now after seeing him in person I'm not so sure. His defense was terrible and his shot selection was terrible.

-I dont care who the starting lineup is or who D'Antoni's experimental rotations are gonna be, when it was Kobe, Dwight, Pau, Nash and Metta walking out on the floor at the start of overtime -- you could just sense the fiery and wrath they were about to unleash. For those few minutes at the end, after being so disappointed in every game this season...you could see the glimmer of potential that everyone thought they would be. It was really like that shot in the Avengers where the camera swirls around the team united.

All in all, the game was amazing!

You each have a lifelong friend and supporter in me.

Sorry if it seems to drag some.

If you didn't get to watch the memorial today, do yourself a favor and try to catch it all online. It was a very rich experience for the fans and really moved me.  
  
I think it really struck me after Kobe went up to speak. Now, I've always known of the sociological impact that sports have on communities. I remember some years ago when I was debating a friend of mine the Lebron vs. Kobe argument and he seemed to always try to build his points around stats. I tried to reason with him the intangibles of what make great players great and ultimately teams as well.

&gt;When I think of a player like Kobe or Magic, I don't evaluate them purely by what they do on the court. I think of their commercials, their endorsements, their personas and celebrity-status off the court. I think of how intelligently Kobe speaks and how he multi-culturally represents my generation (that of the global era). I think of how magnanimous Magic's star power was. I always liken the Lakers to a Hollywood movie, partly because of the nature of living amongst the glamour and drama of tinseltown. We've had so many storybook moments(amazing plays, clutch shots, overcoming deficits) in our history and because we do it in such a stylized and high-profile fashion, we transcend the world of sports and stats sheets. It becomes something more. The players are full-fleshed characters in the best film/book ever written for the sports world. The saga continues every season. We are so blessed to have life-long Laker legends like Kobe and Magic. The Lakers have written them a glorious story.


That being said, I've realized now that this depiction of the Lakers wouldn't have been possible without Jerry Buss. The idea of viewing sports as entertainment, as a ""movie"", is not an inherent property. It is created. Jerry Buss created that environment. He turned this franchise into a phenomenon, a spectacle, a point of pride and admiration. This team feels like it's almost family to so many of us because that is the nature of how Jerry Buss operated: he always kept this little project of his in the family, and the city and its fans were that family.  


&gt;We all know of the valuable lessons that sports can teach us. They promote optimism and competition. They encourage diligence and hard work. They represent man's most ideological and sought-after desire: to attain the highest form of greatness and excellence. The will to constantly improve, to always be better. They represent at a very core level, the human will to persevere. The reason I believe sports are so relatable is because they are in a sense the lowest common dominator that symbolizes this ideology. In a sense it's almost gladiatorial like in ancient Rome. You can be the smartest person or the dumbest person in America to appreciate sports equally. These profound things are represented on the surface by people just playing a game, and chasing greatness is represented on the surface by championships. Because of how successful we've been, the Lakers embody this not just in a season, but as an identity every season


In this time of loss and death, I've never thought of the game of basketball in such existential terms. Us fans can take countless experiences and lessons from the show our team puts on for us every year.They don't even have to be related to basketball. Kobe said it best. It has become more than a game. The Lakers play for more than the game, themselves, or a season. They are playing for an idea. They are playing for the dream, and Jerry enabled this in every minute of his history with the Lakers because he himself was the grandest of dreamers. No, the Lakers are not a force of nature in the NBA because they are simply the Lakers. They are so successful because of what we have witnessed: the manifestation of one man's dream for a sports franchise that transformed into something much more. The Lakers are a testament to great thinkers thinking with philosophical implications; They were led by a man who chased an ideology of creating material things out of immaterial ones. He blazed his own trail and produced value for things that didn't yet exist. The Lakers represent the purest of excellence in this game, and that is because they play not just for the game, but for Jerry's ideology and worldview. It has nothing to do with the LA market. Sure, it makes things easier to have a large *potential* market, but you can't reach greatness without the right personnel and the right state of mind. Would the players have won without their guidance from him? Would they be the legends that they are without him? What about Jerry West, Mitch, and the scouts? My philosophy is that everyone is a product of their environment and those around them. There's no better environment than feeling at home with family, even at work.

I've thought about how I would feel after Kobe retires and how the team would never feel the same again. I fell in love with the Lakers as a little kid in '96, and Kobe is all I know. Many juggle between the struggle of supporting a player or supporting a team. Look at Lebron fans. They don't care about Miami, they care about Lebron. Yet, now I've realized just what the Lakers have done for Magic and Kobe and the others. They are not great players who happened to be successful on the Lakers. The Lakers are what gave them success, and the organization has written a glorious story for all of them. Obviously players come first and are the most important facet of the sport, but to truly be great, you must have much more support than that. The Lakers don't just win because they are good. They win because, top to bottom, from the Forum/Staples Center janitors to the owner, they have all the right ingredients. That's what happens when Jerry Buss takes care of everyone and brings them with him. For that we owe a debt of gratitude to our great conductor who showed us how to do it. If Dwight has even an ounce of intelligence in his head, I don't see how he could leave this team after hearing what he heard and saw today. This transcends basketball. There really is nothing else like this franchise. You have the unique opportunity to play for something truly great, and it has nothing to do with the market or a history to live up to. 

&gt;Nowadays, you can love NBA basketball without actually liking the game or even knowing how to play it. You don't have to be an enthusiast to follow this game, unlike some of the other sports. You can merely like it for what it symbolizes: the stories, the personalities, the inspiration. We all have our intimate relationships with our teams. I really believe that the state of this sport today, an ooh and awe spectacle of human ability, would not have been possible without Jerry Buss' influence. He was the embodiment of success, and the Lakers are who they are because they played for that man. What an utter joy it is to be a Laker, and for us, a fan of the Lakers. We are truly in tune with one of the most beautiful examples of the human effort in american culture.  


Long live Jerry Buss, and life, love, and prosperity to the Los Angeles Lakers.",,False,,t5_2qhv6,1361588535.0,,,True,t3_190hdo,http://www.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/190hdo/ive_come_to_a_revelation_about_the_lakers_today/,

""Dirk is rounding into form at the perfect time. Dirk wants to get a fresh cut before we face the Spurs in round 1. 

TONIGHT IS THE NIGHT. GO MAVS.""

""Good thing with MWP out is that Marion can take on Kobe. Let's hope he shoots a lot!""

""It is unhealthy how pumped I am for this game.""

""Remember what we did at the Staples Center in the first game of the year? Deja vu tonight.""

""Shaq's ceremony, Dwight healthy again, Mamba on PEDs, Gasoft Jamison and Nash always motivated against Dirk, Stern, refs, home court....

Does not look good. Let's hope we win wth a buzzer beater.""

""Looking for JET and Peja to put this one away early.""

""My electric razor is fully charged and ready to roll! Let's do this Mavs!!!""

""ugh Kaman. *braces self*""

""wow kaman with 4 points right at the start. 30 more and i will fly over and apologize""

""god, every loose ball going back to the lakers""

""dang that blake dwarf going through there as if he was tony parker.... crap""

""This is what happens when a bowl of tapioca is playing center.""

""Dirk getting frozen out in favour of Kaman and Mayo chucking. No surprise.""

""Kaman ruins evrrything for Dirk. And when Dirk aint getting touches and shots.... the Mavs are terrible.""

""I swear kaman makes 2 shots he thinks he should shoot it every trip down the floor as soon as he touches the ball. Congrats you made 2 shots. Dirk is also out there bub""

""Kaman so good on D that Howard has 6 already, good move!""

""I wish Kaman would foul out.""

""TNT already on Kobe's d*ck.""

""I'm already having problems to listen to TNT. They are all having a hard-on for Kobe. Never heard of being neutral as a non-local journalist?""

""mayo, plz stop that bs. ur hurting the team""

""So damn sick of Mayo.""

""How come I'm not surprised watching Collison getting blocked?""

""Gasol again screaming like being stabbed to death. Really, the master of vocal flopping. Annoying as hell.""

""WTF? Every shot the lakers get is open.""

""This team is so damn flawed. The playoff chase is fun but I can't wait to see some retooling this offseason.""

""God this team is beyond frustrating. And these commentators will not shut the fuck up.""

""Honestly, we're not putting up much of a fight so far. They're controlling everything. We're scrambling (ineffectively) on defense and not swinging the ball on offense. Recipe for getting blown out.""

""I want to shave dammit!""

""Too many guys shitting the bed and great coaching...""

""As soon as I saw Kaman starting I threw up.""

""What is this? The official Kobe network? Kevin, Reggie and Chris are really deepthroating him...""

""lol at our pgs""

""turning off, time to sleep and pray for a Dirk monstergame""

""We suck!""

""Pathetic showing. Lakers don't even look good and they are destroying the Mavs.""

""Will we even shave this season?""

""Jesus Christ Dirk.

Pull your head out of your ass.""

""Btw Kobe played 24 minutes in the first half. No rest at all. Well, he shows some determination, not like those guys in blue who are sh*tting the bed...""

""Call me crazy, but I believe the MAVS shaves tonight by 101%.

Book it.""

""Seriously Mike James.

Go F**K YOURSELF.""

""Jesus Christ Carlisle. Get Kaman the f*ck out of there""

""Keep being feisty, Mavs!""

""down to 5. never thought it would happen. and it was kaman and mayo!!??""

""Can we trade for this Earl Clark guy?""

""earl f**** clark 3-4 from downtown""

""Back up to 12 in less than a minute. Pathetic.""

""Rooting for jazz over Lakers I guess""

""One quarter. Our season comes down to this.""

""Dirk MUST play the entire 4th.""

""This is fucking humiliating.""

""I cannot wait for this season to end. I'm tired.""

""nice charge dirk! okay, if we're gonna make a run, this is it....""

""btw we have 4 FTA for the entire game...""

""Get Jerry West off my f'n screen.""

""Wow the Mavericks left one of their worst games of the season for tonight. Atrocious.""

""we sure do know how to make ourselves look like fools""

""GTFO rick carlisle. SITTING DIRK? i'm more of a rick guy than most mavs fans at the moment, but this just has me irate as shit""

""Carlisles brillance cost them tonight.""

""this is truly embarrassing. even the worst of the worst teams have either been beating the lakers or taking it to the final possession. what does that make us?

f this noise.""

""we're all jazz fans now.""

but this one play for some reason has been burned into my memory because to me it sums up who kobe is. even though he was stuck in what he may have thought was a miserable situation playing for an organization that he might have felt lied to him and betrayed him he still had the passion for the game.....the fire and desire(heh) to win no matter what. 

i'm surprised there is a clip of this play on youtube because its such a small play in a game that didnt mean much but i searched 2007 pistons lakers and there it was. kind of feel like i hit a jackpot or something. its just a small clip of kobe forcing a jump ball but his reaction is what makes it memorable.

Pacific Division included a whole slew of different neighborhoods, Venice, Oakwood, Mar Vista, Playa Vista, and where a lot of Lakers players and staff live, Playa Del Rey, including Jerry Buss's mansion that overlooks the ocean.

One morning around 3 am my training officer and I were driving down Lincoln Blvd when we decided that radio was slow so we should grab a bite to eat. The first place we saw was Del Taco. We pulled in and saw a limousine in the parking lot. We walked inside and were met by 7-8 smoking hot women, all 9s or 10s on any guy's scale, and who else was there? Dr. Jerry Buss.

Immediately my training officer goes ""Dr. Buss? Really Del Taco?"" Jerry Buss smirked and replied ""girls got to eat."" 

I learned something very valuable that day.

It's a summary of the appearance on ESPN radio.

""Recap of Dr. Robert Klapper on 08/11/12 710's Weekend Warriors program &amp; chief of orthopedic surgery at Cedar Sinai.

Some highlights: 

1. From an orthopedic surgery standpoint he would much rather have Dwight's back than Andrew's knees. 

2. The knees have a much more ""chronic injury"" issue than Dwight's back which is an ""acute injury"" that can be repaired with very little sequelae. 

3. After surgery, you can't play basketball and engage in any heavy physical activity for 4 months. 

Why? 

Because the injury is a disc herniation: a small amount of the nucleus pulposus or the ""shock absorber"" of the disc got squeezed out. It is a VERY SMALL amount. You get rid of the ""squirted out"" material with a 1 inch incision under a microscope. 

There is a 5-10 percent chance that returning to physical activity too early could herniate more material. That's obviously not good because you've reherniated the disc and have to remove more of the extruded disc. 

Bear in mind that Dwight was fully recovered, pain free, and ready to work out probably a few weeks after surgery (it is only 1 inch incision after all). BUT returning to physical activity too early gets you that 5-10 percent chance. Keep in mind that means there is a 90 to 95% chance that if he came back after only a month or so he would be fine. 

But he is Dwight Howard and so they are being super, super cautious. 

4. He had surgery 04/20/2012 which means he should be able to resume training, weights, basketball activity, etc around 08/20/2012 if everything goes according to schedule and he feels no pain, etc. 

5. Per Dr. Klapper, based on that schedule Dwight should be ready for opening night (10/30/2012). He'll have 2 months to get his conditioning back. Again assuming he recovers as expected and at his age and conditioning there should be NO REASON for any setbacks. 

6. Dwight will ALWAYS know he had surgery, he'll ALWAYS feel just a little different. That's unavoidable. BUT that feeling doesn't affect his ability to do what he needs to do. Per Dr. Klapper as fans we should be able to tell NO DIFFERENCE in the way he plays. He should have essentially NO difference in his skills, athleticism, etc.""

This was the first year of the past 14 years of my life that I was not able to attend a Lakers game. Due to the ridiculous prices and the Clippers playing out of their minds, I was unable to attend a game for a decent price. 

So it got me wondering. What if we organized some sort of event when we can all attend a game? Perhaps we can buy a bundle of tickets for some good seats at a reasonable price? 

Maybe we can also organize something for an exhibition game as well since those are much cheaper.

If we can get enough interest maybe we sort something out. I think it would be awesome if we all pre-game together and watch a game.

Edit: we just might have something here guys. If you guys are interested, shoot me a message and I plan on sending out emails with updates (if it works out of course) 

EDIT 2 (9:08 PST): Alright guys. It seems like getting a skybox would make most people satisfied. I have never been in a skybox myself so I'm even more excited. 

If there are some of you who has some sort of ""hook-up"" and won't mind collaborating with me, I'd love to get your email and hopefully we can try to work something out.

IF YOU ARE INTERESTED, PLEASE SEND ME A MESSAGE WITH YOUR EMAIL. I will try my absolute best to give you guys as many updates as I can. Of course next season is pretty far from now, but I think if we get the ball rolling on this, we could probably attend more than just one game.  ALSO, if you guys can let me know how much you are willing to spend, we can see what seats or skybox would fit us best for the price.

u/Pau_Gasol, thanks for the help. I will most likely need some help later on, but I'll give you a shoutout once I get roughly 20 emails.

In the meantime, stay awesome guys. I really hope we can pull this out and have the best reddit meetup in the history of reddit meet ups.",,False,,t5_2qhv6,1365739932.0,,32,True,t3_1c5k5q,http://www.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/1c5k5q/hey_laker_fans_i_was_thinking_we_should_all_go_to/,

I'm going to consider Utah *and GSW* as our playoff contenders and consider the possibilities for 7th seed.

Criteria: Clear favorite (6.5 points+), Slight favorite (3-6), Close game (2.5 to -2.5), Slight underdog (-3 to -6), Clear underdog (-6.5-)

-----

Clear favorite: vs SAC, @SAC, @ORL, vs NOH, vs WAS (5)

Slight favorite: @MIN, vs DAL, @PHX (b2b), vs GSW, vs HOU (5)

Close game: @GSW, @MIL (b2b) (2)

Slight underdog: vs MEM, @POR (b2b), vs SAS (3)

Clear underdog: @IND, @ATL (b2b), @LAC (3)

-----

I'm estimating we win 75% of our ""Clear Favorite"" games, 66.7% of our ""Slight Favorite"" games, 50% of our ""Close games"", 33.3% of our ""Slight underdog"" games and just 25% of our ""Clear underdog"" games.

As of right now we projected at **9.83** wins. Which rounds up to 10, right on line with Hollinger's projections: http://espn.go.com/nba/hollinger/playoffodds

Due to Utah's recent slump, we are projected to only need to win 9/18 games for the 8th seed. Exactly half our games. Stating the obvious, but this our seed to lose now. Moreover, a good rule of thumb is that for every game we lose, we ought to win one. We really need to fuck up big time to miss the playoffs at this point. If we win all our Clear favorite and slight favorite games we'd have 10 wins... so even if we lose against every time we are evenly matched against or underdogs... we are still on pace to make the playoffs - in fact, possibly with a even breathing room.

The more interesting consideration is what we'd have to do to get 7th seed. Lets look at the tie breaking situation, if we manage to tie for the 7th seed. Right now, we are leading the series 2-0. We blew them out at home by 24 points and beat them in OT @ their place. We seem to match up well and the GSW are, frankly, very lucky to be where they are. They have a -0.78 win margin... meaning if you tallied the total points the score against all teams and compared it to the total points their opponents score they'd be losing by 40. In fact, both utah and us have higher win margins that GSW. More than likely, we'll own the tie breaker, whereas they only way they could take it is if they went 2-0 against us and had a better division record. Right now they are leading 7-5 to 5-5, if they 2-0 us they'd be 9-5 and we'd be 5-7... it'd be very unlikely for us to own the tie breaker if we got 2-0'd. Even if we are ""evenly matched"" against them.. they'd only have 25% chance of winning the tie breaker.

Assuming we own the tie breaker, we'd need to go 11-7. If we just beat all the ""clear favorite"" teams, we'd be projected at 11.08 wins... just enough to get the 7th seed. If we take care of business, we'd likely get the 7th seed.

-----

**Looking forward to next week:** @ORL, @ATL (b2b), @IND, vsSAC. This is our toughest stretch of 4 weeks left and we projected to exactly 2-2. Two horribad teams and two very strong teams @ their place. Going 2-2, will allow us to maintain our projected 1 game lead on Utah (which would be 2 games ahead, cause they own the tie breaker), but if we manage a 3-1.. we'd be projected at 10.83 wins, which would put us on pace for the 7th seed. However, a 1-3 finish would project us at 9.83 wins... just barely ahead of Utah. A 0-4 finish would make us the projected 9th seed.

The game that is most crucial is tomorrow's game @ORL. While we should win easily, i'm always scared for the Lakers on the road and we don't know how Dwight will react to return. There is no way we are losing to SAC at home with rest... so tomorrows game will determine whether we are likely to go 1-3 or 2-2 and better this weeks. Tomorrow will determine whether this week will be shit or if we'll have a possibility to climb even higher (but at the minimum maintain).

I'm going to update my projections and still make the assumption that Utah is our competitor.

Criteria: Clear favorite (6.5 points+), Slight favorite (3-6), Close game (2.5 to -2.5), Slight underdog (-3 to -6), Clear underdog (-6.5-)

-----
Clear favorite: vs TOR, vs SAC, @SAC, @ORL, vs NOH, vs WAS (6)

Slight favorite: @NOH (b2b), @MIN, vs DAL, @PHX (b2b), vs GSW, vs HOU (6)

Close game: vs CHI, @GSW, @MIL (b2b) (3)

Slight underdog: vs MEM, @POR (b2b), vs SAS (3)

Clear underdog: @OKC, @IND, @ATL (b2b), @LAC (4)


-----

I'm estimating we win 75% of our ""Clear Favorite"" games, 66.7% of our ""Slight Favorite"" games, 50% of our ""Close games"", 33.3% of our ""Slight underdog"" games and just 25% of our ""Clear underdog"" games.

The math works out nicely, projecting us at EXACTLY 12 wins. 12-10 would put us tied with Utah's projection, but, unfortunately, they own the tie breaker. Hollinger, too, projects us at 12-10, as seen here: http://espn.go.com/nba/hollinger/playoffodds

-----

They key to the playoffs is the same, we must TAKE CARE OF BUSINESS. If we beat ALL the teams we are suppose to beat (our ""favored"" games) we'd only need to win **ONE** out of **TEN** of our close --&gt; underdog games.

Hell, if we just win all of our ""clear favorite"" games, we'd only need to win **THREE** out of **TEN** of our close --&gt; underdog games. The way Kobe is playing lately, I wouldn't be surprised if he basically single-handedly gets us a few.

Of course all this depends on us actually beating the teams we ought to beat.

A good rule of thumb for the remainder of the season is that for every  loss to a team we should beat is another win we need against teams at or above our level. (This is due to being in the convenient position of having exactly 12 teams we are ""favored"" against)

Right now the amount of teams at or above our level we have to beat to make the playoffs is ONE. How much (or if at all) the number increases, may very well determine our post season hopes.

-----

Looking Forward to next week: @OKC, @NOH, vsTOR, vsCHI. We are projected at 2.17 wins meaning if we split the next two games, it would put us slightly behind our projection and if Utah keeps with Hollinger's projections, it will put us in a worse position than we are now. However, if we go **3-1** this week, we would actually be the favorites to get the 8th seed. We would be project to get 12.83 wins, which rounds to the crucial 13 we would likely need for the 8th seed.

Moreover, just to spice things up if we beat OKC tomorrow, we would be projected 12.75 wins, which should make us the favorite to get the 8th seed immediately! Even if we do lose tomorrow, we could still become favorites by the end of the week if we finish 3-0.

-----

The X-Factor: Our last two games are at home against SAS and HOU. SAS is projected to have a 71.4% of getting the 1st seed. If they have a substantially enough lead on OKC, Pop may be inclined to limit his stars' numbers. Turning an underdog game to a favored game. Moreover, we should root for HOU to be a position where the last game of the season does not make a difference in their standings. Which, would cause them to limit their stars' minutes, giving us a ""clear favorite"" game in the comfort of the Staples Center.

-----
NOTE: I'm am using what I think Vegas will project these odds and then giving the other team 2 points. The reason for this is that Vegas has historically (over almost the last 20 years) overestimated the Lakers. This is because the public loves the Lakers and we are consistently overvalued (not saying we are overrated, but we get hyped a lot with our relatively consistent dominance for the last 2 decades aka Mr. Buss gets da ringz). In fact, if you just blindly bet every game against the Lakers spread over the last decade, you'd actually turn a profit. Same if you bet every game for the Spurs (consistently underrated by public). And, yes, people still do this. Normally, you'd just subtract 1 or 1/2 a point, but this year we've been particularly overhyped - even for a Lakers team. (we are 24-36 ATS) If you bet every game against the lakers this year you'd easily be in the top .1% of cappers.

With that said, our lines vs MIN was -10 1/2 and vs ATL was -5.5, meaning MIN was a ""Clear favorite"" game and ATL was a ""Slight favorite"" game.",,False,,t5_2qhv6,False,,lpp,True,t3_19oiyn,http://www.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/19oiyn/the_lakers_road_to_the_playoffs_22_games_left/,

1355149979.0,36,self.lakers,14ls8x,Are the Lakers really that bad? - ESPN Insider (text inside),RanByMyGun,42,6,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/14ls8x/are_the_lakers_really_that_bad_espn_insider_text/,"Nothing has gone according to plan for the Lakers, who already are working on their third coach, their fourth starting point guard, and tonight in Oklahoma City, their seventh attempt at getting back to .500.

This game was supposed to be a showdown of two Western Conference heavyweights, and instead we find ourselves using the singular form. Steve Nash has played six quarters, Pau Gasol is resting his aching knees, and Dwight Howard hasn't looked anything like the defensive dominator he was in Orlando.

And yet, the Lakers really aren't that bad. Yes, going 9-10 against an easy schedule is disturbing, but this poor result has been driven as much by luck as skill. The Lakers are just 1-9 in games decided by 10 points or fewer, and have gone 8-1 in the others. They beat Denver by 19, Golden State by 24 and Houston by 11. They've outscored opponents by 4.1 points per game, the sixth-best figure in the league, and are in the league's top eight teams in both Offensive and Defensive Efficiency -- only the Clippers and Spurs can make a similar boast.

Those marks will go down once the Lakers start playing more road games against difficult teams -- like tonight's contest, for instance -- after starting with 12 of 18 at home against some fairly light fodder, Still, it doesn't sound like a team on the brink of collapse.

L.A. also has had some notable defensive woes late in games, such as in the Orlando game, even if it has been solid overall. The Lakers might be eighth in overall defense, but they're 25th in the last five minutes of close games, according to NBA.com. This is a 21-minute sample, so we probably shouldn't obsess over it, but it does help explain why they've fallen short in most of their close games.

Nonetheless, these are the type of things that tend to even out in the long term. Step back and look at the big picture, taking into account the injuries to Nash and Gasol, the instantaneous coaching change, and the fact that Howard is still recovering from offseason back surgery.

Sum all that up, and the Lakers haven't been nearly as disappointing as some might think. For me, the similarities to the 2010-11 Heat have always been there -- like that club, this one was thrown together with star talent that needs to figure out how to play together. And like that club, this one gets virtually nothing from the supporting cast.

That Heat team, remember, started its season in similar circumstances -- they were 9-8, had lost a home game decisively to Indiana, and had vultures circling at about this same point. Miami went 62-20 in the regular season, only falling in the Finals to Dallas.

Of course, that Miami team also had one key attribute the Lakers lack: health. That will make the Lakers' attempt to turn things around much slower and more difficult; it's perhaps emblematic that even their new coach is recovering from surgery.

But that also takes us to the key problem regarding the Lakers, one that is far more worrisome than the Hack-a-Dwight (which really shouldn't worry them at all, because the percentages are in their favor unless Howard turns into Andris Biedrins) or their recent crunch-time defense (which probably should worry them a bit more).

No, the real issue for L.A. is this: How does a team with this many resources end up with a bench this bad? The Lakers still have the capability to challenge for a conference title when everybody is healthy, but right now injuries have exposed the crumbling support behind their four-star façade.

I find this amazing. The Lakers have a $100 million payroll, and everybody in the league is clamoring to play for them. Ask around the league and nobody will criticize them directly. But you can see in the rolled eyes and wry smiles that most of the league's executives believe that they, too, could build a pretty decent team if they could outspend everyone else, if they were one of the top destinations for every single free agent, and if they could still ride the coattails of one spectacularly good 1996 acquisition.

Yet we're headed for a second straight season of near-total worthlessness from the second unit, and the year before that they were basically relying on one player (Lamar Odom). Amazing fact: A Lakers unit with their top four bench players (Jordan Hill, Jodie Meeks, Antawn Jamison and Chris Duhon) is minus-37 in 46 minutes. Subtract Jamison and they're even worse: minus-50 in 58 minutes. Small samples, yes, but frightening all the same.

This obviously coincides more or less with the ""take-under"" of the Lakers' front office by Jim Buss, and it's a worrisome prospect going forward. Everyone fawns over the Lakers' offseason because they got Howard and Nash, but those two chose the Lakers as much or more than anything L.A. did.

When it really came down to the challenging decisions of building out the roster, this team is riding a three-year failure streak that starts with the four-year, $16 million deal they gave Steve Blake in summer 2010.

First of all, you never pay backup point guards like this: They're relatively easy to find cheaply, and their peaks are typically short enough that a four-year deal is madness. Second, they let a better player leave (Jordan Farmar) in order to do it. And third, Steve Blake? Seriously? He was 29 years old, had never posted a league-average PER, and wasn't any kind of defensive ace. In three years in L.A., he's been in single digits the entire time and is now out injured.

Look around at other spots on the roster and you'll see a similar story. Meeks? He's there because they let Shannon Brown walk, even though they easily could have afforded him. Jamison? He's your new Matt Barnes (their one solid signing in the past three years), who left this past summer to sign a one-year minimum deal in the same city.

And let's not forget the ones who already came and left. I'd say the Josh McRoberts free-agent splurge was a wee bit disappointing. The Troy Murphy Era was a hoot, too. Hey, anyone have Theo Ratliff's number?

Of course, other teams have to roll the dice on inexpensive veterans, too, and not all of their gambles work out. Still, we've seen lots of teams with better hit rates than the Lakers. Atlanta, for instance, last season had players 7 through 12 on the roster all making the minimum salary, yet had one of the league's more productive second units. Somehow, the Lakers can only dream of such things.

Still, all this might have worked out OK if the Lakers had drafted anybody remotely helpful since the brilliant selection of Marc Gasol with the 48th pick in 2007. Admittedly, it's tough to pull off when picking where the Lakers do year after year, but they've also shed so many draft picks in salary dumps, cash grabs and quick fixes that they haven't selected in the first round since 2006.

The 2009 draft was a good example -- they picked 29th and in a deep draft had several potentially helpful players available to them: Toney Douglas, Chase Budinger, Dante Cunningham, Sam Young, Jonas Jerebko, Danny Green, Marcus Thornton, Patty Mills and DeJuan Blair all were picked 29th or later that year.

L.A. didn't take any of them. They traded the pick to the Knicks for cash -- The Lakers! Trading for cash! -- and a 2011 second-rounder that became Andrew Goudelock, who struggled in his one pro season and was cut in training camp.

Their other second-rounder in 2011 was Darius Morris, who recently was pressed into service as the starting point guard and was so bad that he had a negative plus-minus while playing nearly all of his minutes with Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol and Howard. (Morris played 190 of his 359 minutes with the other four starters; that quintet is minus-14 this year.)

All of which raises the question: Why don't the Lakers have good players on minimum or low-cost deals like everyone else? Jamison has been helpful offensively, even if he's the walking definition of toast defensively, but that's about it. A quick glance reveals that some pretty useful players -- Nate Robinson, Leandro Barbosa, Sam Young and Ronnie Brewer -- signed for the minimum, and a great many others signed for just a bit more. The Lakers, meanwhile, kept $1.5 million of midlevel exception money in their pocket after signing Meeks and called it a summer.

Any of these decisions might be defended individually, but taken as a whole, they paint a fairly damning picture. The Lakers have other issues -- making the Pau-Dwight frontcourt work, defending in crunch time, etc. -- but the biggest one is that the front office just hasn't given the key players enough help.

In the long run, they'll probably be fine. L.A.'s record is something of a mirage right now, even with the injuries. Nash will heal, Howard and Gasol will figure out how to play off each other, and the weakness of the supporting cast will be a distant memory if the four stars can play 35 to 40 minutes a night in the playoffs.

But this rocky start isn't a total accident. The Lakers' inability to build a decent supporting cast for their star-studded core left them open to struggles like these, and it's a big reason they've lost ground to the West's other elite teams.

Asked to turn around a sinking ship full of lamborghinis with no training camp, and a championship-or-nothing fan-base, that's a tough job.  Add to that that he consistently hears a chant by fans that says ""We Want Phil"" at home games (including his first home game, and the most recent playoff game, and I'm assuming today as well).  Hard to be upbeat about that.  He seems to have handled that well.  

What he **HASN'T** actually handled well is the actual **COACHING** of the team.  From disrespecting and undervaluing Pau (who was playing hurt), to attempting to cram his uptempo system into aging and injured legs that couldn't do it, to ignoring defense (no surprise there), to taking public knocks at his players, Mike D'Antoni has consistently proven he's not the right guy for the job.  Look at how ecstatic we were to just squeak into the playoffs.  We finished a ""monster"" 8 games above .500.  Wow.  While I think Phil Jackson was the right choice before (although who knows if Phil would've even taken the job on no training camp), I'm pretty sure that bridge is burned (thanks Jimmy).

LONDON—Gather around, everybody. Old Man Bryant has something he wants to say. He may want to tell you about Anthony Davis's tenuous position as the youngest player on the U.S. men's basketball team: ""If he doesn't listen, we're going to shave his unibrow."" Or Russell Westbrook's eclectic wardrobe: ""I know he wears a lot of weird s—. It's a generational thing."" Or maybe the proposed age limit for Olympic basketball players: ""I think it's stupid.""

Kobe Bryant, once a mercurial teenage prodigy, has a new role at the London Olympics: the elder statesman of U.S. basketball. At 33, Bryant is the oldest player on Team USA, which will open its Olympic competition Sunday against France. In fact, Bryant is the only American in his 30s.

Saw some discussion about NBA champions needing a big man. Absolutely true. But people believe Gasol deserved Finals MVP in '09 &amp; '10. While Gasol was a top player at that time, I need r/lakers to remember some things besides pointing to Kobe's 6/24 FG in Game 7 of 2010 Finals. This isn't to take away from his teammates or to forget Fisher's clutch factor, Gasols dependability, Odoms versatility and everyone else filling their role to a T. 

I personally will never forget Ariza's steals, Fishers 3's, Gasol's put back, Metta's put back, Fisher dominating in Boston, and Ron's 3 in game 7. Basketball is always a team game, but ladies and gentlemen, let credit be due where it is due.

* Dwight never fully recovered from his back injury
* Coaching change after about 6 games into the season
* Hiring D'Antoni over Phil Jackson
* Countless injuries including season ending ones by Jordan Hill (and possibly Metta World Peace due to his torn lateral meniscus)
* Coach is too stubborn to realize the system and roster aren't fit for each other
* Jerry Buss passes away
* Pau has significantly regressed due to his changing role in D'Antoni's system and his lack of presence in the post

TOP THINGS TO KNOW

1. The Lakers enter 20-25 on the season, their worst 45-game start since the 1993-94 season (17-28). However, they’ve won three consecutive games, their longest win streak since winning five straight from December 14-25.

2. Kobe Bryant has recorded at least 11 assists in each of his last three games. The only other time Bryant has recorded at least 11 assists in three consecutive games was in January of 2009. Bryant’s 39 total assists in his last three games are the most over a three-game stretch in his career.

3. This marks Steve Nash’s first game in Phoenix since his second and most recent stint with the Suns from 2004-05 to 2011-12 (8 seasons). Over that span, Nash won two MVP awards (2004-05 and 2005-06 seasons) and led the Suns in games played (603), points (9,808), field goals (3,594), three-point field goals (947) and assists (6,597). The last game Steve Nash played in Phoenix as a visitor was on April 3, 2004 as a member of the Mavericks (9 points, 14 assists).

4. The Suns enter 15-30 on the season. Phoenix went 23-22 through their first 45 games last season. This marks the Suns worst record through 45 games since the 1996-97 season (15-30), which was former point guard Steve Nash’s rookie season in Phoenix.

5. The Suns and Lakers have combined for a .389 win percentage (35-55) this season. However, these two teams have combined to win each of the last nine Pacific Division titles (Lakers won last 5).


BONUS NOTES

* The Lakers are 10-6 this season against teams currently under .500. The Lakers won the first meeting this season against the Suns 114-102 on November 16th in Los Angeles.

* The Lakers are 5-10 in January. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, the only time the Lakers lost more than 10 games in the last 20 seasons (1993-94 to date) in a calendar month was March 2005, when Los Angeles went 5-11. The Lakers' franchise high for losses in January is 11, set in 1958 (5-11) and tied in 1959 (7-11).

* The Lakers are just 5-15 on the road this season. Only the Kings (5-17) and Suns (4-19) have worse road records in the Western Conference this season. 

MORE BONUS POINTS

* Lakers have an average margin of victory of 13.5 points in their 20 wins, which is the third-highest for any NBA team in its wins this season (Clippers, 14.0, Rockets 13.8).

* The Lakers have recorded a points differential of +1.5 this season. That is the only positive points differential for a team that is currently NOT in the top eight in either conference.

* The Lakers rank 26th in scoring defense this season, allowing 101.1 points per game. However, the Lakers have allowed fewer than 100 points in six of their last nine games.

Man.  This team is Pokemons.  Got all these accomplished players then you bring in some dude with zero gym badges.  Within a couple of games he already says something like, ""If the players don't fit, we need to find players that do.""  Hard to imagine yourself taking his commands, right?  New kid on the block.  Expects someone to shine his shoes already.

Hate to make this another D'Antoni piss and moan, but I still believe Phil was the only guy who could come in and tell everyone to shut up and play their role.  Dude just has that aura.  He has the gym badges.  D'Antoni has been unable to unify this team.  We have too many guys who want things done their own way. 

Dwight wants inside out.

D'Antoni wants outside in.

Kobe will be Kobe no matter what.

Pau wants Dwight's job.

MWP is full of surprises.

Nash is trying to feed 4 other mouths with 2 hands.

We're not just trying to plug square pegs into round holes anymore.  We're like, trying to drive a car with square tires.

Is that even possible?

D'Antoni thinks it is.

Time to enjoy the rest of the season for what it is: an emotional roller-coaster.  Had a lot of seasons where the playoffs were a given and you could skip games without feeling guilty.  Now every game counts.  Then we have the Dwightmare redux to look forward to.

San Antonio is in a very tight race for 1st with OKC, and assuming that the 8th seed goes to Utah, that would be a big difference between either GSW or HOU, both of which are far, far better teams than Utah. They will likely play their starters, spelling trouble for the Lakers. 

Houston, also, will likely play their starters to try to get that 6th seed and avoid OKC (although it's debatable whether Denver is a better matchup), and GSW certainly will. Now, the Lakers have had some success against GSW in the past, but got trounced the last time they played. 

And let's not forget we have a very difficult time winning in Portland. Utah plays a MIN team that gave up a long time ago twice. If they win both of those games, the Lakers must win 4 of the next 5.

""It was probably the best defense somebody's ever played on me since I've been in the league -- just constantly putting pressure on me, touching me, hitting me at all times in the game. He wouldn't let me just catch the ball easy, and I wasn't able to get the ball a lot, so it was pretty difficult.""

I never take the compliments between lakers players too seriously because they're protecting each others egoes, so it's interesting to see an opponent say something like this. 

We all know Kobe is an excellent defender when he actually has a star assignment and isn't conserving energy. I think if they can keep finding these assignments for Kobe and let Nash take more and more of the ball-handling duties, this team has a chance to become elite.
