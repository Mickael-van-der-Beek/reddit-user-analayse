Cred: I have an MFA from SCAD (2010).

I've got the skeleton of the site set up: a bit of text, a sitemap, etc. My video camera just came in the mail yesterday, so I have yet to start on lessons, but that will come very soon (this week).

The idea I have is to create a bunch of video lessons on a wide variety of subjects. I want to keep it open source, so people can submit questions and lessons. It'll be powered by a youtube channel, with suggested learning paths compiled into playlists (which will be embedded in the site).

So from all of you guys:
What do you want to learn?
How would you like to interact?

I just want gather information on what aspects you are curious about, and which techniques you are particularly interested in. If there's anything you're having difficulty with where I can attempt to aid you personally as well.  
 
 
I can also make a quick run-through on the specific process used on my boyfriend if there is interest in that?  
 
 
I'll edit together a list to try and cover your suggestions in video-format :) 
 
    (please excuse any grammatical errors, I'm not a native speaker)


EDIT: lots of good suggestion, so here's the list so far:

* common mistakes beginners make, and efficient ways to correct them
* how to blend and choose color
* my planning process for pictures
* examples of personal work, speedpainting
* process of crashcourse I gave my SO

I suffer from pretty severe depression, so I've been searching for something, anything, to help with that.  Recently, as the title says, I discovered that drawing is very therapeutic to me.  So, I was hoping to share some of my endeavors.  Please feel free to critique, as I really would like to learn and grow.

All of the below links were done on my iPad 3 through the app Procreate.  I use a stylus. :)

This is the first drawing I did.  It was for /r/sketchdaily 's daily theme.  The theme was ""Eastern"".  I'm not super proud of this one.  I wanted to try something I had never done in doodles or art class, and this was the outcome.  I also wanted to have a different take from the other submitters. 

http://imgur.com/a/S6up4#2

My second drawing was again done for the daily sketch.  This theme was ""Pumpkin"".  I'm actually really proud of it.  The shading isn't stellar, but it turned out better than I had anticipated.  I think the over all feel is pretty cool.

http://imgur.com/a/S6up4#1

This is a WIP.  I just sat down and started drawing, and this was the result.  It's a robot-skeleton hybrid.  My favorite part is the little insect thing :).

http://imgur.com/a/S6up4#0

And, finally, the piece I've put the most time and effort into.  I've probably put around 8 hours into this (which is kind of pathetic).  It too is a WIP.  I'm REALLY happy with how this is turning out.  Easily the most challenging piece I have ever done.  As well as the one that has turned out the best.

http://imgur.com/a/S6up4#3


As I said, please, please, please live critiques.  I want to learn and grow.  Thank you for taking the time to look through my art.  I hope you enjoy.

1353534067.0,45,self.learnart,13l5wn,"What do YOU consider ""the basics""?",puddle_stomper,50,5,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnart/comments/13l5wn/what_do_you_consider_the_basics/,"I see lots of posts from people saying ""How should I start?"" and the responses tend to be pretty similar, ranging from ""draw as much as possible"" and ""go to drawspace.com"" to ""learn anatomy/proportions"".  While I've seen some really good responses, and I think drawspace.com is a good collection, I feel like many responses are pretty vague.  Additionally, I've seen a lot of people linking to [Journey of an Absolute Rookie](http://conceptart.org/forums/showthread.php?870-Journey-of-an-Absolute-Rookie-Paintings-and-Sketches) (an interesting and helpful thread), but digging through 10 years of posts isn't something that gets an already-frustrated newbie motivated.

So, **if you were teaching a class of people who have never drawn anything more than stick figures, what would your syllabus look like?  What specific techniques do you think are important to lay out right from the start (first week/month/semester)?** What are necessary steps to take before jumping into drawing a giant landscape or portrait?  Maybe we can compile a good basic syllabus/list of steps for beginners.

For example, I started with the ""draw as much as possible"" route at first but struggled.  I found [this](http://www.proko.com/how-to-draw-the-head-from-any-angle/) video on how to draw the head, and that has been a major step in developing face-drawing skills, even at the most basic level, because a lifetime of drawing stick figures made it difficult for me to comprehend anything other than a flat circle head.

I never graduated or went to college, but I've been painting since I was a kid and I haven't stopped. I haven't felt any need to draw from life for all this time. I wasn't interested, and I was getting praise and attention (and shows) for the work I *was* doing. 

I've changed. I'm 25 now. 8 months ago, I lost my job and my room. I moved to the city. I took apart an old table and made a ""chair"" with the pieces. I started sketching the little blocks that were left over. I've since incorporated the blocks into my paintings.

I decided to get back into drawing, but even though I felt motivated, I was undisciplined. I had the idea of adding it to my routine, but actually *doing* it seemed to be difficult for some mysterious reason.

All it took to get back into it was the first step. All I had to do was sit down and draw. I set up a still life in my room, and started small. I started drawing for 15 minutes every morning before work and 15 minutes in the evening after work. 

15 minutes turned into a half-hour and then an hour. I'm feeling good about the direction I'm taking my work. Nobody expects me to do this, I'm doing it for myself. The results are encouraging. 

So my advice to you is to start small. 15 minutes sketching every day at first, and the time you spend on it will naturally increase on its own. You'l sit down and before you know it an hour will have gone by and you will have accomplished something tangible. 

TL;DR: Becoming disciplined isn't easy, even if you're motivated. Start small. 15 minute sketches will eventually turn into hour-long drawing sessions. ",,False,self,t5_2s6fc,False,,,True,t3_11qro8,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnart/comments/11qro8/what_i_did_to_get_back_into_drawing_from_life/,

I would like to first apologize for my absence for a few months. The reasons are this:

About a month ago, my MoonMonstar (http://reddit.com/r/user/moonmonstar) account started showing up as 'page not found'. I frankly have no idea why, and have no idea how to correct the issue. I've been emailing the reddit admins, with no reply. This means that my attempts to make self-posts regarding the moderation issue have automatically been deleted, and any attempt I have made to appoint a new moderator have been met with a 500 error. I did not realize they were not showing up, and only recently just checked for that.

I will continue to email the admins in regards to this. I'll update you guys when I have more information.

I've always taken a very hands off approach to moderation, as I believe people will naturally upvote valuable content and downvote unhelpful content. I will continue to do this, as well as attempting to keep the overeager redditfilter from eating your posts. Message me if you have any concerns.

If you'd like to help me find out why my account is currently stuck in limbo, and how I can get it out, message the admins: http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Freddit.com

In addition, consider this forum as the open application to Modship. We are nearing 10k subscribers, and it needs to be maintained by more than one person to keep the vile spamfilter at bay.

Cheers,

MoonMonstar

*Update:* I was just contacted by the reddit admin team, saying that my account was flagged by reports of linking to my personal website. As I exclusively post imgur links, I'm understandably confused by this. My best guess was that some bad blood was built up when I was debating (civily, at least on my end) in /r/politics and /r/worldnews. I asked them to review my post history, let me know if anything violated policy, and reinstate my account. I am waiting on their reply.

In the meantime, I will be actively on the overeager filter, until reddit allows me to nominate some more moderators. I've seen a few qualified people throw their hats in the ring, and I'm happy to have them - I've always liked this subreddit, and try to contribute when I something falls in my limited purview of watercolours.

*Further update:* Apperently the shadowban also applies to comment replies. So:

Glegleglo: thank you for informing me about the distinguish button.

Pink401k:
I just went in and manually approved your links, but it's giving me the same 500 error when I attempt to make you an 'approved submitter' (thus, I'm assuming, allowing you to circumvent the filter permanently).

I'm going to be active in the cleanup, while trying to get my account un-shadowbanned.

Huisme: That actually works out perfectly. I was attempting to add more moderators anyway, and this circumvents the 500 error.

Advice appreciated.,TheUKLibertarian,35,2,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnart/comments/15ktq8/my_new_years_resolution_is_to_create_a_drawing/,"So I've never put the effort into getting good at drawing but this year I thought I'd set myself a challenge. To create a drawing for every day of the year and post it to a dedicated blog. I'm probably going to commit to giving $5 to charity for every day I miss or something like that to give myself maximum leverage to follow through.

You can see the blog and my first ""benchmark"" post (my starting point) [here](http://everydayadrawing.com/2012/12/24/quentin-crisp-drawing/).

What I'd like advice on is what you guys think would be the most efficient way to go in order to improve quickly and consistently? Is there a particularly well respected book on learning to draw that I could work through? Is there a process of drawing then reviewing your mistakes that leads to improvement? 

For those who have leart without format tuition what advice would you give yourself if you were starting out again?

Currently I'm probably just going to copy portraits or other interesting things as best I can and then comment on the blog on what I think I did okay and what I did badly. From that I should have a framework for what I can work on the next day etc. Not sure though if this will be blind leading the blind so I thought I should ask here for feedback on my proposed process?

I'll probably post everything I do on Reddit too for critique so I can get feedback that way but I just want to maximise my chanceso f getting the most out of this fairly large commitment and I know you guys are going to have better advice in this area than me!

I'm sorry that this post is kind of meandering. Basically I'm not sure what advice I'm even looking for but I know that good artists will have very useful things to say so I'm all ears!

1346756813.0,34,self.learnart,zbwir,One Method To Refine Skill and Technique,MLP_Awareness,40,6,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnart/comments/zbwir/one_method_to_refine_skill_and_technique/,"[I use this method often](http://imgur.com/a/KykXh) when I do sketches I plan on scaling up.

I was taught this method in college from Joe Norman a fantastic and wise artist.

He was very adamant about hard work, and by the end of the semester I had almost 200 drawings of various sizes (mostly small ones)

The method begins as such:

* Think of the concept, emotion, expression, idea, image, shape, or whatever it is that you want to explore.

* Draw 16 small drawings/paintings/renderings exploring every possible iteration of the thought you're exploring.

* Take the strongest 8 and draw them a little bigger increasing the size approximately 25-50%.

* Take from those the strongest 4 and again enlarge the medium you're working with.

* Take your best of these four and choose the one which best exemplifies the original idea. Increase to the desired size.

* If you are doing giant 4' x 6' drawings like I was asked to do, then keep enlarging your final idea, but keeping in mind the addition of increasing detail. A small blank area on the small scale get proportionately bigger on the large scale and more noticeable, you must consider what goes in this empty area.


This method is supposed to allow you to teach yourself. When you step back from something or come back to it , you are better able to make a critical assessment. 


The first 16 drawings allow you to get all the common and unordinary thoughts about what your are trying to do out of the way. The first 8-10 drawings will usually be the common idea that 75-85% of the population will come up with among your peers. The last will be (hopefully) increasingly more unique. *And trust me those last few take time, they don't just pop into your head. They usually are the best ideas though.*


Starting small is also crucial. It allows you to focus more on the general layout and subject of what overall it will look like, and lets you not worry so much about the detail all at once. 


Weeding through the results while increasing size lets you think more about what ideas worked and what commonalties are crucial to the concept. This also lets you simultaneously insert more detail and lets you discover what will fill the voids.


I am not taking credit for this idea, I just hope it may be a method that helps someone in their artmaking. I also do not imply this is a proved/researched method, it is merely a summary of the general ideas my professor taught me.


The pictures I attached obvisously do not follow the method absolutely. **Take this to mean you can adjust change the format to any way that makes sense to you**. Originally we started with 3x4"" squares for ideas, then 6x8"" then 9x12"" then 18x24"" then 36""x48"" then our final dimension. I though this to be a little excessive so I started at thumbnail size and went up to quarter sheets, it goes a lot faster for me. I either go to final size of 18x24"" or do a full sheet of 8.5x11"" then final.


I've also tried this with painting. It helps a lot and saves **TONS** of paint. I also for both drawing,ink,charcoal,acrylics,oil I use a heavy weight 18x24"" multimedium paper and cut it up into 16's and 4's then go to canvas.


Hope this helps someone!
 

edit: formatting isn't working my way, I'll fix soon (hopefully...er..)

I am doing a personal study on artists methods, workflows, mindsets, etc, and I would like to ask those artists here who would consider themselves practiced in higher levels of art.


1.  Are you self taught?  Or did you go to school?

2.  (If you work freelance) How long did it take you to reach 'professional' levels?

3.  What aspects of art are important to you?  

4.  What are the biggest mistakes that you see artists make during study (drawing something new), or producing art (doing what they know already)?

5.  What do you feel are the biggest time wasters in studying/producing art?

6.  If you had 3 months to teach a beginner to draw/paint with an intention of building a strong portfolio for a chance to work in the industry (concept design for example), what would your instruction look like?  What if you had 6 months?

I'm a great musician, fairly decent writer, and a god-forsakenly terrible visual artist. I've never tried to draw seriously but any time I've even attempted a small doodle it becomes readily apparent that I've got a fiercely underdeveloped sense of proportion and scale. Thus, anything I try to draw or paint just looks like a god awful mess of crappy crap. 

The bottom line is: I'm willing to do anything to get better. That means taking classes, listening to any and all advice, buying some supplies, and anything else that might be useful. But given that I'm already 30 years old, I'd like to try and do the things that will be the most efficient and require the least amount of flailing around in the dark with things that will only waste time and won't help improve my ability. I've looked through some of the tutorials listed here, but they seem to be mostly for peopel who aren't absolute beginners like me.

I recognize it's going to take a lot of work, but at this point I'm willing to dive in and do whatever I can. Any help is immensely appreciated!!

This is something that is done on conceptart.org. Basically, I will pick a subject to cover (Drawing for Beginners, Perspective, Painting, whatever you want) and give out assignments each week. Then you post your homework results and I will draw over them and give you advice. In addition to all this, I will also do the homework assignments, with step by step process. 

Is there any interest in this? I know Reddit University had drawing class(es) but I don't know if they exist any more.

I had no idea it would be so long or informative. So, after making it and realizing how much it covers, I thought it was probably worth sharing.


So here's my list of tips for digital art newcomers. It may not be exhaustive or perfect, but hopefully you all can gain some insight from it. Let me know if anything needs to be fixed or added.

-----------------------------------------------------

* You don't need Photoshop.

* Seriously, you don't. Photoshop is a good program, but there are plenty of others out there you can use. Not all of them do the ""all-in-one"" thing PS does, so don't judge them by how many tasks you can do with them. Judge them by their quality and usefulness.

* Get a piece of paper. Now sit back and draw on it without leaning over it. Yes, it's hard to see what you're doing. The point is to try out the body position that you'd use with a pen tablet, so you know what to expect. That should also help you determine what size is right for you. Whatever is comfortable and causes the least amount of arm and wrist strain is best.

* Speaking of tablets, you can get a Wacom Bamboo for about $70. That's great for beginners. Wacom are usually high-quality and you don't need a $400 device starting out.

* Neither an expensive tablet, or Photoshop are magically going to make you a better artist. There's a guy who makes perspective landscape 'paintings' on city streets using nothing but cheap chalk. The skill comes from your head, not your tools. Don't fall into that trap.

* Also, skill is not luck. Some people are born with some talent, but that doesn't mean you're screwed if you weren't. Skill is gained from hard work, not bequeathed from on high. Never accept ""You're lucky to be good at that."", it is **always** ""You're good at that, you must have worked hard."".

* Try not to rest your hand on the tablet very often. When you do, it's easy to accidentally work from the wrist all the time.

* Consider buying or making a stand to sit the tablet on. You may not need one, but they come in handy when you need to prop your tablet up at a comfortable angle.

* Stretch often, or it will hurt.

* This bit is very hard, but do your best with it. Do not judge your work by comparing it to others. That is another trap that **will** retard your progress. You'll get too caught up in either hating your own work, obsessing over making perfect copies, or being too busy learning the other guy's style to develop your own.

* *Do* obsess over your *own* work though. Don't do this too much, but a healthy amount at scouring your own work for flaws helps prevent you from repeating them. It's a bit of artistic introspection that should make sure you don't stagnate. Ever seen that one person's portfolio that has had the same crappily-drawn anime characters for five years? That person neither has their own style, nor do they inspect their own work with a critical eye. Don't be that guy.

* It's okay to spend a month on one piece. It's also okay to only spend ten minutes on one. Spend as much time as you need. Try not to rush yourself while learning. That doesn't mean, however, to only focus on one piece until it's perfect. You also have to know when to stop, and either call it ""finished"", or leave it on the back burner while you work on something else.

* Draw EVERYTHING. That means two things. 1) Draw every object, place, emotion, and idea you can. It's practice, bitch. 2) Draw in every style you can. Learning styles will only strengthen your skills. The more styles you know, the easier it is to create your own.

* That said, don't create your own. Your style will come naturally. Don't force it. Don't try to 'lead' it. Just let your mind design your own style for you. In other words, practice and experiment with your style without any specific goals. Usually, if you try to forcibly make your style one thing or the other, it hinders you in the long run. Not always, but often.

* Similar to how I said ""Draw EVERYTHINGBLARG!!!!"", experiment with everything. Have eyes that are circles? Why not octagons? Like blue skies? Why not peach? Not every experiment has to produce pleasing results, but that's not the point. You experiment to learn and discover.

* Get others involved. Social reinforcement is a great way to keep passionate about the subject you're studying. Having a friend to bounce ideas and critiques off of is just plain good.

* Get into class. Being self-taught earns you a golden badge of awesome, if you survive. Teaching yourself can be a very hard and lengthy process. You have no course to follow. You have no reliable source of info. You have no experienced teacher to point out your mistakes and guide you. Even if it's just a community college drawing course, try to take it. It can only help.

* Also, don't sit in-front of a computer all day. Imagination comes from experience. The more you experience, the better your imagination will be.

* Another reason to not sit in-front of a computer all day is medium. If you only try to work using a tablet, and you can't draw on paper to save your life, **you will fail**. There is no other way about it. Pen tablets are to facilitate interfacing with the computer well enough to ignore the machine and be creative. It isn't a replacement for a sketchbook. If you can't draw on paper while away from your computer, you cannot possibly hope to gain skill quickly or understand your craft deeply. Practice drawing on paper. Get good at that first, and only then you can translate those skills into Photoshop (or whatever program you use).

* And lastly, because I can't think of anything else right now, the obvious tip is to practice. Know how I said imagination comes from experience? Well skill comes from repetition. Draw every day. Every *single* day. Each day you don't draw something is a day you've lost. It's another day added to your counter of ""days until I'm good at this"". Keep a sketchbook and draw in it whenever you can. Even if it's just for five minutes on the bus. You need ten thousand hours of solid practice to master your craft. That doesn't count the many other hours you need to *excel* at it. Every day squandered is a day lost.

------------------------------------------------

Here are some programs you can use if you like.

I'm just a beginner and I've heard the ol' ""Just keep practicing, draw, draw 24/7"" and all of got so far are pieces that look either pretty ok or pretty... Well, bleh. I Just can't really put it to text. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is that I have a wicked problem with basic shapes, and I try to draw from life, but I don't know where just to start 'drawing from life' and what drawing exercises to do.

For example, sitting from a chair, I did a small little sketch of my guitar amp, starting with a little box and then adding detail. [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/PpvYF) 

It's bleh.
I've been to this subreddit before, asking about hands, and I've drawn my own, I even got some darker pencils, too! [This is what happens. It looks alright.](http://i.imgur.com/OlaSU)

However when I try to model the joints of the hands in basic forms, [a la Loomis' basic hand form, ](http://i.imgur.com/zH1nN) it comes out like [this,](http://i.imgur.com/Wm5V1) and [this,](http://i.imgur.com/iW1Lt) which I'm just not satisfied with.

I just really need advice on basic forms, and how to practice them. This may sound ridiculous, but what things in 'life' are great building blocks to draw from? Boxes? Toasters? Pencils? Perhaps trees? What *things* are great for the beginner to draw? Please, I'd love some advice so I can draw 'all the time' and whatnot! I'd greatly appreciate it.

http://www.reddit.com/r/learnart/comments/1ayttr/learnart_art_course/

There seems to be a lot of positive interest in creating a learnart course.  The mods have stated that the first step to achieving this would be to get the wiki set up.  It would also be an ideal place to organize the future lessons and exercises for the multiple disciplines and mediums.  

The wiki can be found as a tab at the top of the subreddit.  For those on mobile you can click [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnart/wiki/index) to view it.

The wiki can be editted by anyone and I encourage you to do so if you feel you can help improve it.  I am certainly not the best at formatting this thing.

Tonight I decided to paint my face with some blick studio acrylic, unbleached titanium white. 

Ever done that before? It burned my skin. My face looks and feels like I got a sunburn. No blisters, but definitely red.

I put a whole bunch of my expensive face lotion on it to try to make it feel better. It looks fucking awful. How am I going to explain myself when people see me tomorrow? Uuuhhg.

Don't make the same mistake I did! Think twice before putting paint on your skin! Perhaps do a test spot first, just to see how it will react! And for gods sakes, if it feels like it's burning, wash it off right away! Don't wait until you get the shot, if you're trying to take a picture. Just go fucking wash it off! It's not worth it!

The mod team and I have been discussing the creation of a FAQ for this subreddit. The consensus is that the FAQ, like this community, should be owned by the members. 

So, I've made the basic layout of the FAQ. Basic with a capital B. [You can find the FAQ here.](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/learnart)

I'm going to link it in the sidebar as soon as we can get some articles for it. I'll write a few, but this is where I need your help. Write up something you know about that has to do with some art skills. It could be basic supplies for some of the mediums listed, a specific technique you like, or a compilation of your favourite books. Please no links to torrent sites though. 

Here is the format:
Heading
Sub-Heading
Article

I'd also ask that you not edit the FAQ directly just yet. Once we get a few things ready to go, then one of the mods can make one big update and not have to worry about version control. 

Thanks, 
Fisgig

I'm an absolute beginner. I picked up a paintbrush for the first time in my life a month ago and loved it, but realized I need to learn to draw first. I've worked through just over half of Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain over about two weeks. Really enjoying it. In between lessons from that, I'm drawing lots of little stuff around me and definitely improving in what feels like more than baby steps, which is a total surprise (I'm old, hadn't drawn a single thing since about age 8).

Today instead of drawing another binder clip, I thought I'd try to peruse some Loomis and try a few exercises. I read the first few chapters of ""Fun With a Pencil"". Tried some heads. The style he starts with seemed too cartoony and non-real-life for me, I felt like if I kept it up I'd be learning cartoonish habits and I'm nowhere good enough yet to make up facial features from memory/imagination. It also wasn't clear what I'm supposed to with sections like ""trick stuff"" etc.

So then I read a few chapters of ""Figure Drawing..."" and holy crap it seems way too advanced for where I'm at. But it also seemed vague on what I'm supposed to be doing (exercise-wise) while going through it. I tried copying a few figure diagrams. It went *ok*.

Anyway, they're both back on the shelf for now, but if/when I feel ready for them, I still have no idea of the way to approach them. I feel like I'll need to read some, ingest it, then try to apply it using real live models?

Pencil artists, how do you deal with this situation? Is there a way to smooth things out after I put a lot of graphite down? Or should I skip some of my layers and go straight to the 6B pencil sooner? Maybe it's an issue of confidence.

This is NOT a tutorial on digital painting. I'm assuming those who are reading this know the basics of digital painting.

One of the most important parts of digital painting (but often overlooked) is knowing your basic Photoshop hotkeys. For gamers out there you know how important it is to know the hotkeys of your game and not click around. So here are some of the most used hotkeys for me (I'm on a MAC so please excuse any Windows related errors):

B - Brush

E - Eraser

By knowing just B and E, you can quickly switch between drawing and erasing and shave off a lot of time. I know the Wacom pens have erasers on the end of the pens, but it's very inconvenient (in my opinion) to have to physically rotate the pen to erase. Using B and E is MUCH quicker.

CTRL Z - Unlimited Undo - I don't like the default Redo/Undo so I changed it to perpetually undo. BE CAREFUL as you cannot redo it (IRC).

Z and X to control brush size is very convenient for me. Trust me you will use these a LOT.

1-9 to change opacity. If you press 4 it'll be 40%. If you want 100% just press 1-0.

Side buttons on Wacom pen to zoom in/out. This also gets used a LOT. The side buttons are very convenient for zooming.

You also have 5 buttons on your Wacom tablet. I suggest keybinding one of them to make a new layer.

Please feel free to chime in on your personal hotkeys, etc.",,False,self,t5_2s6fc,False,,,True,t3_1iaw0n,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnart/comments/1iaw0n/short_guide_to_basic_photoshop_hotkeys_for/,

1370353910.0,21,self.learnart,1fng24,Watercolor tips,HumanGiraffe,24,3,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnart/comments/1fng24/watercolor_tips/,"A while back I posted some water color tips as a response to an/r/artcrit post and thought you guys might want to see it too! So without further wait, here is the comment I left:

Watercolor is intimidating at first, for sure. I have a few tips that might help you though! If you want, practice on a separate piece of paper with them, so you feel more comfortable with the medium! Also, while it's difficult to ""undo"" a mark, it's very easy and in most cases more desirable to layer over colors, which can hide mistakes(:
The first and (in my opinion) most important thing to think about is the thickness of your washes. I like to categorize my washes into 3 different thicknesses: ""tea"" ""milk"" and ""melted ice cream"". ""Tea"" is very light and watery, leaving a thin layer of color (like shading with a pencil). ""Milk"" has slightly more pigment mixed into the water, leaving a layer of color that can still be layered over, but still fairly saturated (kind of like a orange or yellow marker). ""Melted ice cream"" has a lot of pigment mixed with the water, so when you paint with it it leaves a bold color that really can't be layered over (like a purple or blue marker).

Whenever I paint with water color, I first designate areas that are my ""whites"". I don't even put a drop of paint on these areas, letting the paper show through. Many novice painters don't keep their whites in mind as they paint, and the final product comes out looking very dark and without much contrast. Remember: you can always add color and value, but you can't take it away. After I find my whites, I paint a few layers of ""tea"". These can overlap (if the first layer is completely dry) and create a different effect than if they were mixed, sort of like how in some fabrics you can see 2 colors of thread at once, only it's 2 layers of color at once. Once all of my light tones are painted in with ""tea"", I begin putting some ""milk"" layers in. The gradual buildup of thickness results in a much richer painting. Don't skip to the ""melted ice cream"" until you finish these layers! Once you have completed the ""tea"" and ""milk"", you should have a pretty broad range of values, from white to medium-dark tones, and you should have saturation levels ranging from zero to about 80%. Now you can begin your ""melted ice cream"" layer. You don't need to add too much of this thickness, as it can be overpowering if abused. Use this layer to get in your super dark darks and your super saturated areas.

Once you go through all of the thicknesses (while leaving plenty of drying time between layers, of course!), take a step back and look at your painting. The value range should be from white/almost white to black/almost black, and your saturation levels should go from super-pale to hella-bold. All of this should look smooth and effortless, if it looks choppy go back and make the change more gradual. You should be able to see parts of the painting that stopped at ""tea"" or ""milk"". Not everything has to be built up to ""melted ice cream""!

There are a few watercolor techniques that make it much more interesting and can make your process easier. The first is ""Wet on Wet"", which is where you wet the paper first, then use a ""milk"" or ""tea"" color to easily fill in large spaces or an easy gradient. The next is ""Wet on Dry"", which is probably the one your most familiar with: just taking watercolor and painting straight onto the paper. Easy! Then there is ""Dry on Dry"", which is taking a barely wetted paint (less water than ""melted ice cream"". Think just-wet-enough-to-get-on-the-brush.) and painting on to dry paper, creating an interesting scratchy brush-strokey texture. There are a few extra things you can to to your watercolor to make it even more textury and yummy! These include the ""Salt technique"", which is where you sprinkle salt onto a wet area (super wet. like a puddle. The same wet you use for ""wet on wet"") right after you paint it (preferably tea to milk), and let it dry. This creates a cool tie-dye or starry effect. The salt can be carefully scratched off. The next is the ""Alcohol Technique"", where you use an eye dropper to drop rubbing alcohol onto the same type of just-painted puddle (preferably tea to milk) and watch the magic happen! It creates a very cool dotted texture. Then comes the ""Plastic wrap Technique"", where you crumple up generic cling wrap and place it on top of the same type of puddles as in the salt and alcohol techniques. You leave it here to dry and don't touch it. It will leave a crinkly texture. Very cool. Finally, you could lay a thin layer of gauze on top of your milk-puddle and leave it there permanently, leaving a very cool texture.

Don't forget about the magic of watercolor pencils, either. These can be used for easy tea layers by first lightly drawing with the pencil, then going over with clean water. Alternatively, if you dip the pencil in water it becomes very soft and you can draw straight onto the painting, leaving super precise and crisp melted ice cream lines.
As brush strokes go, just remember not to scrub and you'll be fine. Scrubbing your brush, or going over one area too much while it's still wet (if you wait for it to dry before going back you're usually fine), ruins your paper and causes it to get rough and ""pill"". Stay with smooth, flowy strokes. Be brave and don't second guess your strokes. If you need to paint a large area, try the wet on wet technique. and wait until the paper is completely dry before going back with more layers. This will also help your painting from becoming muddy.

If at the end your painting still doesn't satisfy you, don't be afraid to add some detailed pen work over it! Many times I do this, and it might give you that illustration look! good luck and clean your water supply often!

EDIT: a sure fire way to stop your paper from buckling and wrinkling from the water color paint: stretch your paper. This is simple and just takes a little time. STEP ONE: soak the water color paper in water, be sure not to fold it on top of itself. Soak it for ~5-15 minutes, depending on the thickness of the paper. STEP TWO: place down a piece of gatorboard (or drawing board if you must. If you use drawing board skip step 4. It won't work as well as gatorboard) and take the paper out of the water, pushing off the excess water so it's not dripping, but still soaked. Center it on the gator board an make sure there are no air bubbles trapped underneath. You do not actually stretch the paper. STEP 3: cut 4 strips of gummed brown tape, one for each edge of the paper (make each about 6 inches too long). Dip it in water, push off the excess water and lay it on the edge of the paper, overlapping the paper about an inch and a Half. Smooth and move onto the other strips. STEP 4: with the tape and paper still wet, take a stapler and staple around the edge about 3/4 of an Inch from the exposed paper. This will help hold down the tape and keep the paper from pulling. STEP 5: wait a few hours. When the paper and tape is dry, yore ready to paint on a flat, hard surface!

I neglected to take any art classes and instead filled hundreds of notebooks with things similar to what you find in the link (disregard the charcoal, I only discovered it in the last 6 months).

I don't know how to make them look more ""professional."" Obviously, I should start drawing on blank paper.

Tips?",TheCourageToLurk,24,4,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnart/comments/11xicf/super_frustrated_one_sketchbook_later_no_progress/,"Hello all. I've been trying to draw for the last....6 months or so I'd guess, but after about a week or so I give up and start again later. The pattern keeps repeating.

I've poured through the advice given by people (Draw everything you see! Subscribe to /sketchdaily! Just draw EVERYTHING and practice daily!) But these things aren't WORKING for me. I'm drawing just as juvenile and crudely as when I began, there is no insight in my linework and it feels embarrassing and upsetting whenever I pick up a pencil. I've actually finished an entire sketchbook, and my latest picture is seriously WORSE than some of my earlier stuff. 

What's a good way of learning the BASICS so I can actually go about freakin' practicing consistantly? I'm so fed up with being told to practice. How am I supposed to practice if I don't know WHAT to practice on? You can only really practice doing things you already know how to do.

Apologies of this post comes off poorly, I'm just really aggrevated and frustrated and honestly, if I don't get some good advice or direction I'm ready to quit. I feel like such a chump, I feel like I've wasted hours of my time on something worthless and it hurts, because it took me so long to even work up the courage to try, and it feels like it was all for nothing.

Am I better off copying other people to begin with? Because I've been drawing from life, and it just isn't working. I've sort of had a stigma against trying to copy things I've seen, because of an accusation of plagiarism a teacher threw at me wayyy back in grade 8.

I've noticed this with many fanarts when drawing real people in anime (or comic) style; its like the artist gives them a generic anime face and body and then just tries to use the hairstyle, clothes, and/or accessories to identify them as who they're supposed to be. What a few seem to be able to do, though, (which I love), is draw their faces and features in such a simple but perfect way that you can tell who it is just by the face.

So how can I avoid generic-looking characters and draw people in a cute, comic way, but have them retain their unique identities?

She also provides updated curriculum for schools and homeschooling families for a tiny fee which she uses to keep Drawspace.com up and running and is currently offering this curriculum for $10 for a year of access (regularly $49).

I think one of the biggest problems is that I don't know how to lighten something up without washing it out. Adding white destroys the high saturation I'm looking for. Is there some kind of medium that can do that, or is it just impossible?

It's for an assignment, and while it's not a requirement, he'd really like for us to mix our colors rather than just buy a tube; even outside of what he wants, it tends not to look unified if you just slap a color on straight out of the tube, you know?

Acrylics, if that matters. 

I'm kinda pissed about this, actually. I took Color Theory last year and I'm a little stunned they didn't teach me anything like this. But I guess that's what i get for not going to an art school.

No tips, no books, literally a paragraph to read then pencil eraser paper. Nothing else. ",boxmore,26,7,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnart/comments/wv03c/i_think_theres_a_simple_recursive_idea_about/,"For **NOVICES**, that idea is
*practice seeing at a slow pace, and stop ""reading"" lines, match your hand's ""drawing"" pace exactly with this slower seeing space (sometimes looking back and forth between actual line and your hand drawing it on paper, sometimes only look at the line you're ""drawing"" until finished; alternate these, both are crucial). Practice variations of unique lines (not shapes) in all directions: staircases, zig zags, loops, geometric, angular, fractal, curved, etc. Do this to improve your copying skill, not your ability to reproduce one kind of line from memory.  As this improves, practice isolating the lines in simple real world shapes as you see them.
Everything else, every other tip, every other book, is absolutely pointless FOR A NOVICE, until you become decent (you never stop, so just do this daily and you'll be surprised at your progress and how many misconceptions you've been having).* 

Trace the line slowly, but do not break your tracing-seeing! The instant you skip a segment of a line, how can you be sure your eyes have returned to the precise position? Also, did your hand also skip with your eyes? No. Now you don't even know where you are anymore! And that's what this is all about. Learn to stop skipping and reading, and start seeing. Slow and fluidly, and always completely.

Find some way to generate a large variety of lines at no (financial) cost to you. You can't\ drawing the same kinds of lines repeatedly, this is not writing. This is about practicing your seeing skills and your hands' ability to copy any line your eyes see for the first time (unlike writing which is mastering things by rote, this requires the same amount of patience every single time, it's not writing, it won't ever be).

Don't worry about any other materials for a while, there are many things that can be done with lines (and later, shapes and construction, shading, etc.) Just pencil/pen, eraser and paper. You don't even need a plastic grid like in drawing on the right side of the brain, until a little bit later. Practicing seeing is what you should be doing as a novice. It makes everything so clear. 

**Disclaimer: THIS IS NOT THE 100% ABSOLUTELY RIGHT IDEA, IT'S JUST A GOOD IDEA FOR ABSOLUTE NOVICES, AND YOU WILL NOT BE DOING THIS AT THE EXPENSE OF ALL OTHER ACTIVITIES (this is not to become a tattoo artist or comic book writer...), THIS IS JUST AN ENTRY POINT INTO DRAWING FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BEGIN BY DRAWING AND NOT PAINTING OR ANYTHING ELSE. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DRAW MASTERPIECES WITH ONLY LINE BEFORE STARTING EVERYTHING ELSE, BUT DO PRACTICE SEEING AND COPYING LINE UNTIL YOU SEE YOUR SKILLS IMPROVE TO DECENT BEGINNER, UNTIL YOU SEE PROGRESS AT ALL.**

Before I go for a full launch of http://www.ausquared.com, I want to make sure the functionality of it is working properly so that everything goes smoothly from day one. Here's what I've been working on:

I had some problems with the search function I originally used--it was causing some fatal errors (solvable by clearing web cachce). I think I have them fixed--I'm using a different bit of code to search, and it seems to be much more stable. Have a look and make sure that works ok (I've tested from 3 machines so far, and it seems to be fine).

I've added Disqus comments to most of the pages as a simple way to discuss each lesson. Do you guys think this is a good way to go? 

I made a small change to the sharing style: still powered by sharethis, but embedded in a fixed position on the page.

I shuffled around some of the site. Under the ""Contribute"" section, you'll find several pages related to building the community: suggestions for how to contribute, a donations page, and instructions for submitting lessons and requesting lessons.

Up next, I'll be adding a forum for general discussion and for submitting work for critiques (probably by this weekend).

I've been geting back into fine art - I'm a graphic designer by profession so pretty much once I started working full time, I stopped doing a lot of the drawings / paintings that I enjoyed in college.

The problem I face is that I think I have really good technical skill but I'm limited in expression in other ways. 

I do really well drawing from a photo, fairly well from life, but I can't for the life of me just create art from the inside. I can't do abstract, either, something about the lack of structure just makes me anxious. But I really, really want to try.  

I just stall out. I can sit there with a pencil or paintbrush and tell myself ""don't think, just do"" but then nothing happens. 

It makes me feel pretty lame, like I'm not really an artist until I can get through that.

Anyway, I'm just wondering if anybody has gone through something similar or if there are any good pieces of advice, books, online resources, etc. to try and get more creative and less imitative.

I know that this is extremely subjective, but maybe you can recommend a basic kit for pencil/pen sketching and basic marker coloring? Any brands/products you can recommend or things to look out for?

Maybe I'm overthinking and should just get drawing with what I have, but I think that like any other hobby, you will enjoy it more and get more out of it when you get some of the basic tools and essentials right. And I want to learn to work with more than just my mechanical pencil.

My shopping list/ideas so far:

* An easy to erase, (non-photo) blue or red pencil for initial sketches
* A set of traditional pencils (2H, HB and 2B maybe) and a pencil sharpener or knife
* A mechanical pencil (0.5/0.7/0.9 with HB leads) for details
* Eraser(s) (any suggestions?)
* Some black (or gray?) pens (any suggestions? I have no idea what to look for here..)
* Set of maybe 15 grey scale and/or brown markers (Copic?)

Update:  
It's been two months since I posted this, and by now, I've pretty much settled for leadholders with 4B/2B/HB leads, 5 toner gray Copic Sketch markers and a set of Faber-Castell PITT Artist pens as my standard sketching kit.

My name is Sam, first time on this here subreddit. I've been drawing for a little over 9 months now, primarily using a mouse and Inkscape to do illustration.

I do 2d art and animation and have been running into what I believe to be a practice wall. I can now draw most things pretty well from one angle. But when it comes to mentally rotating those things and redrawing them it's both intensely difficult and mentally exhausting.

So! I'm looking for an exercise or two I could do daily to strengthen my ability to mentally view and rotate things. I'm aiming to be more mentally resilient and better at perspective by the end of it.

A little background, I did all the art for Quadropus Rampage, save for the fancy painting which is out of my skill range at present. Here's an [album](http://imgur.com/gallery/04S2g) and [trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIY4XK7ddX0) for that so you can see where I am on static and animated imagery.

Any thoughts are appreciated!

I’m in my second year of college, and my passion for art has turned into a bit of an obsession.

 I'm always working on one or two (or seven) different things, and I mean always as in ‘the whole time I’m conscious, I’m either drawing or planning some new elements I want to introduce to one of my drawings.’ Even when I'm just wandering around my school's campus, I've got a sketchbook, one or two sketching pencils, kneaded eraser and occasionally some charcoal pencils or oil pastels stashed in my backpack at all times.

And I’m learning more than ever.

First off, you need to know, I'm a mostly self-taught artist; nearly everything I know I've learned from reading and/or trial and error, mostly trial and error. Attempting something new and failing repeatedly is the way I learn. I’m talking techniques here, little tricks you use while you’re drawing or painting, not elements of design or perspective, those help you before you lay a pencil to the paper.

Being told what to do doesn’t help me very much. It may be a psychological thing, I don't know, but having a technique explained doesn’t inspire me the way figuring it out does. I get excited when I find a solution to something out I was struggling with, and start using that trick over and over again, but that doesn’t happen if someone tells me about it. On the other hand, if I’m told about it, I may be intrigued but I’m not likely to use it any time soon. I waste time sometimes trying out one idea or another, but it's worth it because that feeling when you learn something new is just. . .

It’s a proud feeling, and you want to tell people, but you’re nervous because maybe it’s actually pretty common knowledge and you just hadn’t heard about it, so instead you do it over and over again because there’s a feeling of ownership involved. This is YOUR technique; you discovered it all by yourself, other people might know it, but as far as you’re concerned, you invented it. 
 
That's why I keep a sketchbook. The experimenting isn't limited to any one specific time-frame; it's a constant daily activity. Any moment I have free, I can sit down and practice. As far as I can see, that's the best way to improve your ability. When I get an idea for the way I want something to look, my reaction is to try drawing it, fail, try again with a different approach, maybe a different medium even, until I get it right.

 Reading about how to be better is all well and good, but until you've actually TESTED what you’ve read, I don’t think you can really say you understand what you’ve just read. The idea you get from hearing or reading doesn’t convey all the effects a technique can have, like hatching and crosshatching. They’re ‘shading techniques,’ right? Well yes, but knowing how they look when I draw them, I use them more often as a way of getting texture. Hatching leaves a shape with a smooth, shiny surface, assuming the lines are spaced right. Crosshatching and stippling on the other hand are rough, crosshatching being the smoother, more controlled of the two.

 Until you've TRIED layering a ballpoint pen over highlighter or taking a toothpick to wet paint, you don't know how best to use them, not really. It's a head knowledge, but until you've done it and seen the results, you can't tell when it's best to use them.
	
I've got no problem with people telling me tricks for using media I'm new to, I search it out with a mental note to try it SOON, before I forget; that's why I'm here on /r/learnart. There’s always someone more experienced than yourself, and they can help. To a point. But it's up to me to find how to do something well, and to be honest, I love testing myself, seeing it I’m right or wrong. And from what I’ve found, nothing ever is flat out, irredeemably ‘wrong’. Maybe it is for what I'm working on, but not ALWAYS wrong. Even when my ideas fail, I learn something; I learn to NOT do that when I want a certain effect, but almost everything has a place where it works. Just not where I’m trying it.

I can’t know, right off the bat, what that context is, but I know how it looks when I do it, and that helps me to find a place for it. Figuring stuff out on my own has given me more confidence in my ability to design new pictures, to organize each element so it works as well as it possibly could in the finished work, complementing its surroundings as well as possible. 

What about you? There's a lot of artists here that are better than me, so I want to hear. Are there any others like me?

I built an initial draft of the site http://www.ausquared.com ; however, it's totally inadequate for where I want to go with it. Here's where I'm headed:

1) I bought a good camera that takes external mic input. High Quality Vids! Yay!
2) I'm learning Drupal. It makes a lot of sense for the features I want to offer everyone.

Here's the plan for Stage 1 of the site (timeline-a couple months):
Free 100-level lessons on a variety of subjects hosted on the Youtube Channel.
Basic User Account with the ability to post on forums to get peer feedback and instructor feedback.
Where applicable, lessons will have both video and text/image breakdowns step-by-step (I now own an Inkling!). 
There will be a Blog with useful info.
Digital Downloads of Vids and associated printable DRM-free eBooks.
There will also be ads, since I have to fund this somehow.

Stage 2 (timeline-6-12 months):
Subscription (don't worry it's cheap) with access to 200-level and above classes if you want to learn a variety of things.
AND/OR Digital Downloads (paid) for 200-level and above classes so you don't have to subscribe if you know exactly what you want to learn. If you subscribe, you get a discount on digital d/ls.
Lesson submission system so any approved teacher can contribute to the school.
And loads more stuff.

I'm excited about this. I can't wait to give all this info back to the world and hopefully provide a cheap alternative to art schools. I'm also flattered and surprised at how many people have watched the youtube vids I've put up, and I can't wait to re-record with better quality and accompanying drawings.

How you hold your pencil and position your sketchbook.

Now, this may seem super simple and second-hand to some of you like breathing but to me, honestly, it never even crossed my mind. I had always sketched with my sketchbook flat on a tble in front of me and held my pencil as I always had in the scribe or ""writing"" grip.

Only recently have I realized there are other methods (which i had glimpsed before but mainly thought were just for specific tasks like shading and such) and trying to delve and get used to this new way of drawing. 

So I'm trying to use the loose grip more, something along the lines of [this for sketching](http://0.tqn.com/d/drawsketch/1/0/5/2/overhand_down.jpg) while holding my book at an angle towards me and focusing on moving my elbow and shoulder as opposed to my wrist. 

Are there any tips for drawing in this type of grip or other useful grips? I've found I can easily draw very big pictures but the very light and thick nature of the lines this grip makes makes it very hard to sketch smaller pictures and also I sometimes have trouble getting my line in the right place as it's a little more ambigious when drawing with the side of the lead instead of the tip. 

**So TL;DR:** Any tips for using different sketching grips and sketchbook positioning?  

[Here's an example of what I came up with](http://i.imgur.com/7wkXJ.jpg) trying to use this new grip for the first time, notice it's super light and has very thick ambiguous lines and also a very ""staticy"" sort of look to it.

Basically I want to draw a ""room"" with an off center one point perspective with the same number of floor tiles on each of the faces of the walls/ceilings. I have a few questions on what I have done thus far: 

1) I've done the ceiling and floor but I'm not sure how to start on the sides because I tried to connect the lines from the ceiling to floor but I realized on the left side from the ceiling to the floor, the lines are not going to be straight! How do I fix it? What did I do wrong so that if I draw the lines, they will be diagonal? 

2) The floor and ceiling are not trapezoids! Where do I end the line at the end of the edge? I took a picture of what I assumed to do but I'm not sure if it's right. What do you think? What should I have done?

So what do you guys do? Scribble and then find pictures? Practice lines and circles? I'd like to hear about it all.

**EDIT** : Typed on my phone and it shows:\ It's supposed to say, ""What *are* some good warmups?""

**EDIT2**: I found the warmup that I had previously stumbled upon! It sounds great so I'll share it. (This is in a comment on another site, btw. That's why I can't link)
&gt;
&gt;""
&gt;The drills are as follows -
&gt;
&gt;Place 8-10 points in a line on side of a page, then another line of points opposite from those. They need to be the same amount on both sides. From there, play connect the dots and try to draw as straight a freehand line as possible in one go. If you try to correct it, or the line gets wavy, nix it and add a new pair of points to make up for the failed line until you have about 8 good straight lines.
&gt;
&gt;Next, I draw a line down the side of the page, and practice drawing freehand straight lines parallel to each other. The goal is to try and keep equal spacing between them. About 10 of these.
&gt;
&gt;The next drill is to draw a straight line, then draw over it 10-20 times. It gradually thickens up the line, but the goal is to train your hand to make repeatable, identical actions when necessary. You don't want the thick line to get split ends, eventually it should look like you took a thick marker and drew a line.
&gt;
&gt;The next drill is the same as the previous, but with arcs or wavy lines. Same goal, but with a more complicated path.
&gt;
&gt;That's followed by parallel arcs - same as the parallel lines, but with the added difficulty of a curve. About 10 of these.
&gt;
&gt;I think draw two lines that have about a thumb width between them, and attempt to draw freehand circles inside those lines. The goal is to have the edges of the circles touch each other while still being circles. Again, forces your hand into being able to make consistent, repeatable shapes.
&gt;
&gt;I draw another set of lines, and do a variation of that circle exercise - draw circles, but try to get them to overlap into the center of the previous one, so it looks like a row of venn diagrams. The goal is to be able to do that without distorting the circle.
&gt;
&gt;From there, I do 20-30 freeform circles of different sizes. These aren't along a line or anything, I just try to fill up a quarter of a page with it. Again, the goal is to be able to draw repeatable, consistent shapes, this time with the added difficulty of different sizes. Larger circles are a lot harder to tame.
&gt;
&gt;Then I practice ellipses, going about it two ways: I draw the ellipse freehand then try to find the minor axis, or I draw the minor axis first, then try to draw the ellipse around that.
&gt;
&gt;From there, I practice some boxes, cylinders, and organic shapes, with the goal of making them appear three-dimensional without shading, just perspective and line.""

I want to give back, I have a bit of knowledge, and I'm certain that I'll be able to get you very far in the first month.

I'm looking for one nub that is very interested in my style of work, darker horror and action, and wants to pursue a serious career in illustration and concept artwork. If you like Beksinski, F.E.A.R, Amnesia: The Dark Descent, and cute gifs of kitties, I want you as a student.

Check out my stuff:

boostplus.deviantart.com. If you are serious about getting better, and can do daily paintings, studies, etc, here's what to do.

1) Email my dummy account alollercoaster9@gmail.com. I need you to write up your ambition for getting better (your inspiration, where you wanna go with life, etc), but not like a 20 page write up of your life. I have a life, too. Be short, Corban Dallas short.

2) Send me three of your recent art pieces: one that you're ""fuck yeah"" about, one that gets you frustrated as hell, and one that looks alright, but to you something's missing.

3) Also, please send three of your favorite youtube videos. While I'm not interested in you impressing me, I'm interested in seeing who you are when no one's looking. This also red flags anyone who likes Justin Beaver or anything equally retarded in my eyes.

And that's it. Make sure to have a copy of Photoshop CS(whatever version, I use CS 2).

I will teach you use of brushes (especially the cool ones), PS jiu jistu, color values, anatomy, composition, and everything else that you can see in my work.

Which is right here: boostplus.deviantart.com.

So let me know if you're interested. I'll stop looking at this dummy email by the end of this work week (Friday August 5th) and I'll make my decision after that.

Just remember: alollercoaster9@gmail.com. Nothing long winded, three pics, awesome videos, and grammar. Please mother of god use grammar.

This is my first post!

I have been wanting to draw for a while now but after getting all my stuff out and looking at the white piece of paper and trying to think about what to draw I would give up and not draw anything.

I've been reading Reddit for a week now and this subreddit for a couple of days and [everydayadrawing](http://www.reddit.com/user/everydayadrawing) inspired me to do the same. I need to force myself to draw to get better.

Anyway, here is my first drawing: http://imgur.com/nmHMpEP

I'm happy with the general result since it's my first one but I think I could have chosen a less ambitious project for my first drawing. My main difficulty was to get the right angles or perspective with all the curves of the ukulele (sorry if the terms are not very precise, English is not my first language). That's why the body looks so thick and the head looks crooked.

Another difficulty pas contrast. strings and frets are pale and other parts, like the fret board, are darker, the hole being the darkest. Iv'e had difficulty having the strings look good.

Finally, wood grain was really hard to do considering the different contrast levels.

This took me about 2 hours. I guess I could keep working on it, darkening some areas, make it crisper.

Comments on improving my techniques and posting on Reddit are welcome!

I'm very impressed with artists who can start a drawing or painting from the ""middle"" and work their way out, rather than starting with an overall sketch and slowly getting more detailed - does that make sense?

For instance, [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cUv4csQw1o) shows the painter starting with the shadows around the face and nose, gradually expanding the face until the picture is complete. Obviously, the artist is seeing the whole thing in his mind before he starts.

I'm still terrible with proportions, and when I sketch I have to start with really general shapes and redraw and redraw and redraw. I'm wondering if there's a way to improve my ability to ""see"" the image I'm trying to draw rather than what seems more like a trial-and-error approach.  What should I practice?

I hope I made sense here... I know exactly what I'm trying to say, and yet I can't articulate it the way I want.

How do you practically use that to draw it so that it's accurate?

I hope this makes sense. Also do they strictly either hold it only horizontally or vertically? As in the ctrl paint video, it's showing you that you need to do it to measure an angle.

My concern is as a result of these seemingly makeshift methods (and my lack of artistic skill), the lines will not look nice, and will be jagged. For example, I'm considering etching a steampunk-style clock into the plate, though if I try to use the methods described, the gears will not be circular and will have misshapen and assymetric teeth.

I'm not a beginner, but intermediate. And I have a problem that many people have, yet I haven't solved it yet. And I'm looking for advice on (what I think is) art/creativity block.

Basically, I have lots of ideas. But whenever I get to sketching them, they turn out to be stupid. So, 2 years ago I just figured I'll start practicing. And now for 2 years I have practiced like hell and I'd like to go forward but I just don't know where. I have no idea what to practice anymore. I'd like to go more in depth into poses but I never know what poses to draw. I've had even few courses on drawing figures. Croques are easy, just too easy. Standing poses are easy, I want to go deeper. Go into drawing fantasy! Bad-ass characters, angels and devils. All sort of that stuff what makes you go ""COOOL!"".

But... I have no idea what to draw. It's not even about the blank canvas... I can draw a pelvis with legs and twisted legs... but when it comes to drawing an interesting, thoughtful pose with some kind of idea... I stumble. My head becomes empty when it's something I have to make up. Sometimes I spend two days looking for reference pictures for one pose I thought of doing, and couldn't find anything good enough. Then I try to resolve it by drawing the image in my head as a 3D object on paper (from many directions), but it becomes too stiff.

And then I try to practice making the pose more fluid by drawing it over and over again, trying to fix everything that is wrong. And when I finally get what I was looking at in the first place, the idea just seems boring and not worth the 10-20hour painting in PhotoShop. 

I sort of want to make fluid poses on the go, but I never can think of tens or hundreds of good and interesting poses. 

I've also tried inspiring myself and then just drawing. Eg. listening to music, watching speedpaints, reading tutorials, browsing artsites, reading... but as much as I want to draw something, I'm never satisfied either with my idea or with my painful work. And yep, I know that brain is 5 years ahead of my skills. I'd just like to know what should be my general direction.

Things I want to learn: Building structures, buildings, environment details, fluid poses and compositioning.

I've kind of picked up sketching on a whim .. as a new year's resolution and started off with drawing on the right side of the brain since it seemed to have lots of good reviews. I've never fancied myself as much of an artist so it was a pretty amazing moment when I finished a portrait of my dad with lights, shadows and everything.

Now, the question is where to go next. Do I keep following what Betty Edwards says and stick to drawing what's infront of me? Should I pick up Loomis and learn a bit about anatomy etc. ? Or do I just follow the course on the side bar called ""Drawing Tutorial"" ? (Seems pretty interesting)

I would like to paint at some point, but apart from that I honestly don't have a specific thing I'd like to be doing in the future. I'm a programmer, I love my job, and would just like to learn how to paint / sketch just 'cause it's the only thing I find as much fun as programming right now.

No digital art etc. because drawing allows me to get away from the computer for a while.

* Hold down SPACEBAR and click and drag the image around the screen
* Click and Drag on the image to color pick

So I have the sources(motivation) and websites wich explain me how to draw and give me tips, but I have a difficult time finding or coming up with stuff to draw, I also like using references so I can look at it.

My question is: What should a beginner draw (basic animals ?, Fruit ?) or is there a random image generator website I could use that is going to give me a picture I can look at ?

Slow down when you study, slow down when you sketch. Block things out before trying to nail anything down, use ‘diagrams’ for proportion and perspective like in the Loomis books; You have so much knowledge in your head, but your brain can’t just conjure it in a geyser of inspiration and perfect anatomy and perspective. 
    
If you go slowly and carefully, and you realize your first line does NOT have to be your last line (use the eraser!), you refine your sketch as you go- you will be able to flesh out the already existing knowledge you have. Every time you make a bad sketch, GO BACK AND FIX IT. Erase and refine until it’s as close to perfect as you can muster. Use reference. Be meticulous. 
    
This is as much a process for working as it is for learning. Speed is born from confidence, and confidence is born from comprehensive understanding and experience. Make it your goal to learn something from every little doodle you do. 
    
Remember, knowledge is not some fickle groundhog that comes out to play only on the ‘good drawing’ days; you have to apply and refine knowledge to utilize it’s potential.

It's supposed to be something that she can look at when she gets stressed out, to remind her that I am there for her and 'got her back'. Anways, I have already drawn a rough outline with pencils.

The thing is - **I don't know how to add some color to it**. I am pretty good at doodling with my pencils, at least for someone that is not seriously into art. But I don't want to just hand her a black and white drawing in pencil. I want *color*.

Now bear with me for a second - **I haven't seriously worked on a painting since highschool**, about six, maybe seven years ago. So I don't really know a lot about advanced techniques or materials. That's why I come to you, so please, help me!

**What would be the best/easiest way to add a whole other level to my drawing**? I would of course be willing to draw it completely new, since I already have a sketch.

I was thinking watercolor would be nice, but I used to hate it in highschool, it was either always to wet (the paper would crumple) or too bright, I never really got the kind of watercolor that, for instance,  ShittyWatercolor has in his pictures. It's kind of hard to describe, but in good watercolor paintings, the paint will look kind of watery, but it doesn't destroy the paper.

Oil or acrylic might be another option, but I have never worked with it before.

In any case, what do I need to know about material? Does it matter which paper I draw on? What about brushes?

I use a dip pen and watercolours, and right now I've been using normal sketch paper. However, I find that this paper doesn't hold the watercolour very well, and it often starts breaking up when the sheet gets wet. 

Quentin Blake uses large, thin sheets for his, and if I could find something like this only in A4 then that would be amazing. I've looked on the internet but the various terms ('hot/cold press' etc) don't mean anything to me, and it's difficult to tell the texture/feel of the paper through pictures alone.

Thanks!

At all. Like, stick fingers is the extent of my sketching skill.

However, I want to get into Industrial Design, which requires you to be able to sketch out concepts. I'm currently a Mechanical Designer/Drafter, which means I create 3D models and use those to make technical drawings for manufacturing. I'm very good ""spatial"" thinker, and making 3D models comes naturally to me, but transferring those ideas to a 2D sketch is very foreign and I can't ever seem to pull it off.

The general advice around here seems to be to draw from an actual picture or object in front of you, not from a mental image. But since this is for Industrial Design and creating new concepts, that's not really possible. So I don't think I can approach it the normal way.

I have dabbled in Microsoft paint for silly drawings for friends, but lately I've been inspired to really give drawing a go.  My main interest is learning how to draw manga, however I don't even want to attempt learning the basics as I don't feel confident about my strokes.

As I was trying to find ways to get better with my lines, I started to trace some of my favorite characters and what not until I felt comfortable using the tablet.  

Is this the right way to go, or should I start learning how to draw basic manga figures as soon as possible?  If it is correct, then when do you think would be a good time to swap to drawing my own art?

So my sister basically said that my works should 1)show how I think; 2)show how I express my thoughts; and 3)show my skills (techniques).

The ideas I've been having are just basically inspired by things around me, like the music I listen to, movies I like, the streets I cross every day, or some are more directly related to me (childhood, habits etc). Some aren't even relevant to my life, I just think 'hey, I want to draw *this*' and I just have an image in my head.

I am going to include one self-portrait as well.

I, like many people liked drawing as a kid (some even said I was good...those people were lying XD) but then I stopped for whatever reason and then recently decided to actually get my ass into gear and get drawing...like really  put some effort in to learn the craft. 

I understand that it takes time and effort, I understand that its not going to happen overnight, and I certainly understand (or sincerely hope) that I DO have whatever it takes to improve and get good at it. I have been practicing more or less consistantly. I took on the Idea that whatever I do in life theres no point in NOT drawing, my ""goal"" is at some point to make a comic since I also like the Idea of telling a story and when it comes to writing I'm not that great at Prose.

recently though (I think due to other factors) I was struck with an overwhelming sense of ""whats the point?"" whats the point? if I put in the hours upon hours of work and in the long run it gets me nowhere? whats the point if whatever I produce no ones going to read/see it?  whats the point if there are other, more ""worthwhile"" things I could be doing?

I think the problem here was I was reading up on the otherside of things....the next step in getting your [whatever] out there and I think that was a BAD Idea because, first I am nowhere NEAR that stage, and second its only going to stress me out and stop me from focusing on what I really should be focusing on (drawing! obviously)

so yeah...sorry for the whining there...so I guess I should ask how do you stay motivated? I try and do it every day and make it part of my daily routine....

First off: I'm a newbie. I started drawing in the first week of this year (it's my resolution to learn digital drawing until the end of this year :) ) and my first project is the drawing of a game screenshot. While I didn't have any problems with the proportions, perspective and sketching, I'm now having problems with refining the actual draft. 
I just can't make it to [the last step](http://www.ctrlpaint.com/sketching-lines/), I am never really content with my lines. Though it isn't much of a problem with the shorter ones, I can't get the long and curvy ones right. Long strokes are just killing me.

But besides that, a problem which occurs in my studies are shadows and light (not sure, but I think you call that *value*?!), especially clothing folds. My approach is to paint the whole area in the basic color and to darken/light up the places where there is a fold. But this just doesn't look right. Overall I don't get the coloration right. While it was easy to shade abstract forms, the same technique kind of looks out of place on clothes or skin. 
Or should I take a completely different approach and just draw the image in black and white and use layer -&gt; multiply and color it then? But I don't manage it to shade it in black/white neither.  

I'd highly appreciate some tips to help me with my problems :) I'm using PS CS5 and a Wacom Bamboo Pen - if this is relevant.

Cheers!

I've found lots of videos of people using illustrator, sort of getting a feel for the flow, but I can never get good settings.  Anything helps, thanks!!!",,False,self,t5_2s6fc,False,,,True,t3_mz2pv,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnart/comments/mz2pv/illustrator_tutorials/,
