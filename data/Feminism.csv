&gt; ""Men, are you worried for your own safety because misandry?
&gt;
&gt; You need to accept that misandry happens in the real world and take some precautions.
&gt;
&gt; Take a self defense class, they’re only a couple hundred dollars a month.
&gt; 
&gt; Don’t go out after dark unless you have a woman to chaperone you. Misandrists are less likely to attack if they see you are with another woman.
&gt; 
&gt; Don’t wear anything too douchey. If you’re wearing a fedora or a sexist t-shirt, etc. you’re pretty much asking to get attacked. Misandrists can’t control themselves when they see a man in a fedora, their instincts kick in and before they know it they have a dead male corpse in their hands. Just be a good boy and don’t tempt them, okay?
&gt; 
&gt; Don’t ever invite a woman into your home. Misandrists will interpret this as you consenting to physical violence.
&gt; 
&gt; Drinking increases your risk of being attacked by a misandrist. They target drunk men because their inhibitions are lowered.
&gt; 
&gt; Never leave your drink unattended. Misandrists are notorious for poisoning men at parties and bars.
&gt; 
&gt; If a misandrist does attack you, be quiet and just let her finish or you might anger her further and you are liable to get murdered instead of just mutilated. But also, be sure to put up a good fight because a lot of men say they don’t want to be attacked by misandrists but deep down, they really like it.
&gt; 
&gt; And remember, accusing a woman of abusive misandry is worse than being abused by a misandrist. So before you make accusations, make sure it wasn’t all just a silly misunderstanding.""

There are MRA amongst us. I know it makes some of us afraid to post because we'll just get argued with or harassed.

However, the very fact that they're here only furthers our need for feminist activism. The fact that they're here, arguing us, makes it seem like they need to approve of our opinions before we, as women, can have them. This is what feminism has always fought.

So to MRA reading this: I'm sorry, I didn't know women needed a man's approval before they could have opinions. This only makes your whole MRA campaign seem more bigoted and misogynistic, though I'm sure that doesn't bother you. We're here to talk about feminism and issues pertaining to women, and you try to bring a male point of view, or try to force your opinion of women onto us, as if we can't have our own.

I'm sick of constantly getting attacked on any subreddit I follow whenever I mention anything that remotely mentions equality. I mean seriously what's the point. God and the awful PMs about how I'm a cunt who just wants her cake and wants to eat it too. One of the reasons I chose this username was so people would assume I'm male so I wouldn't have to deal with the sexism of this website. It's ridiculous that that was the first thing I considered when making an account name. I actually deleted my first account because of all the shit I was getting.

I used to think the best part about reddit was the discourse involved with sharing links and the interesting information I'd learn from the crowd-sourcing involved with reddit.

 Society trusts police to deal with at least the most blatant forms of sexual assault (though of course not by returning power to the survivors), even though [male law enforcement officers commit sexual assault 50% more than the general male population](http://www.copblock.org/1813/rapists-with-a-badge/) and [police families have domestic violence 2-4 times as often as American families in general](http://womenandpolicing.com/violenceFS.asp).

 [""Feminists don’t think all men are rapists. Rapists do""](http://dbzer0.com/blog/feminists-dont-think-all-men-are-rapists-rapists-do) because of behaviors such as rape jokes which normalize rape.

 Though not all men rape, [men commit 95% of sexual violence](http://feministstudentsunited.org/2010/11/19/this-is-what-rape-culture-looks-like-an-explanation/).  
 Many schools teach the mechanics of sex, but do not [properly explore informed consent and expressing or respecting boundaries](http://www.phillyspissed.net/sites/default/files/learning%20good%20consent2.pdf), which supports a culture of sexual assault.  
 In the U$, R-rated films may graphically depict rape but not consensual, mutually pleasurable sex explicitly. Cinema normalizes sexual assault to young adults.  
 And it's not like the patriarchy's porn has good consent practices either:  
(A) If a porn actress needs to stop in the middle of a sex act, she loses her paycheck, which many simply cannot afford to do  
(B) Young heterosexual men learn about sex in a culture where 99%+ of porn must be profitable or popular in a patriarchy, centered on male pleasure, primarily managed and produced and owned by males, for male viewers, available on-demand, with zero-investment, for instant gratification, without the awkwardness, hesitation, doubt, discomfort, refusal that take place in real, consensual sex relationships.  
(C) Porn videos by definition don't depict participants stopping if one party no longer feels comfortable with the sex; ""the show must go on"", the contract is binding, and it must climax. For those who this porn conditions, seeking climax can overpower consent.  
 The dominant culture teaches **rape myths** that **falsely claim**:  
(A) ""men ought to be active and dominant and stern"", ""women ought to be passive and submissive and forgiving""  
(B) womyn ""play hard to get"" and must have sex coaxed out of them (which, beyond sexual assault, encourages male stalking, perceived entitlement to womyns' bodies, and treatment of womyn as public property)  
(C) womyn, rather than independent entities of intrinsic value worthy of respect, are mostly [investments to accrue the possibility of sex from](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2c8rl71nV1r3jsrko1_500.jpg) (since men have to ""score"", and in patriarchy ""man fucks woman...subject, verb, object"")

(F) rape is something male strangers do outside at night, even though [80% of sexual assaults](http://www.houseofruthdothan.org/rapemyths.htm) take place by a known male and 50% [indoors during the daytime](http://www.houseofruthdothan.org/rapemyths.htm)  
(G) if it's a party and there's drinking it kinda-sorta-maybe-isn't-rape-if-she's-drunk, even though, on average, [""at least 50% of college students' sexual assaults are associated with alcohol use""](http://www.collegedrinkingprevention.gov/supportingresearch/journal/abbey.aspx)  
 Men often [engage](http://feministstudentsunited.org/2010/11/19/this-is-what-rape-culture-looks-like-an-explanation/) in victim-blaming toward rape survivors (""She asked for it with those slutty clothes!"") rather [than support them](http://www.phillyspissed.net/sites/default/files/survivor-support.pdf), trivializing sexual assault (""Boys will be boys!"") rather than [unlearning it](http://www.phillyspissed.net/sites/default/files/menunlearningrape.pdf), and undue skepticism, if not outright hostility, toward womyn's sexual assault allegations.

**EDIT**  
Some folks asked, basically, so what do we do?  
Here's what I do: I do consent workshops with youth, and self-defense workshops with young folks, womyn, and queer and trans people. I also help organize a youth program as much as possible run by the youth themselves, practicing a ""culture of consent"" in all interactions. The covenant they (~50+ kids per gathering, middle school age) came up with for each attendee to agree upon includes statements like **""Encourage and practice Culture of Consent. Respect that no means no!""** and **""Empower people to voice their needs.""** and **""Act as an ally: defend those who need defending.""** We combine this with decentralized, ad hoc councils for conflict resolution, based on restorative justice, to significant success.

I am a heterosexual white man. I am a feminist. I'd like to share with you the story of why. 

I first met Melissa (not her real name) in freshman biology last year. She was drop dead gorgeous. Red/brown hair, blue eyes, these cute freckles. Amazing body. We started talking after class, and found out we had a lot in common. We both loved indie music and cycling, and some other hobbies, but more important, I think we clicked. We hung out a lot, usually in a small group of friends, sometimes one-on-one. A few weeks later, she emailed me with a surprising message.

Basically, she said she was sorry if she'd been acting weird around me. She really liked me, but she wasn't ready to date anyone. She had been raped a little over a year before we met. Understandably, she had a lot of trust and intimacy issues. I told her I really liked her too, and I totally understood if she didn't want to date right then. I also asked if she had told anyone else (self-centered, I know), and she said yes, she was seeing a therapist. I told her I liked her as a person, not just as a potential girlfriend, and if she was comfortable with it, I wanted to keep hanging out. (Yes, MRA trolls, I friendzoned myself.)

We studied together. We ate together. We talked, texted, and messaged eachother practically every day. A lot of people thought we were going out. I told them we were just friends, and that was true, but we did everything a couple would do together, except for the physical side. 

One night, around midterms, she kissed me. She said her therapist was encouraging her to push her boundaries, and she felt ready. After that, we would kiss and cuddle, but never anything more. I told her it wasn't a big deal to me if we didn't have sex. I was head over heals in love, and I was happy with what we had. A couple weeks later, she asked me to go down on her. Believe me, I was only to eager. I went down on her in her dorm (private rooms FTW). She seemed nervous, but excited, and she came, then promptly kicked me out. I enjoyed a rueful fap in the bathroom.

Next time we're together, close to finals now, she asks me to go down on her again. “Are you sure?” I asked. 
“Yeah. I'm sorry I got weird last time. It's just been a really, really long time.""
I went down on her. She came, and this time, she pulled me up and asked me to put on a condom. 
“Are you sure?” I asked again. “I don't want to rush you.”
Again, she said she was ready, she loved me, she wanted me. I took it slow, since it had been a while for both of us. She seemed into it. As soon as I sped up, though, she went stiff. “Stop, please stop,” she whispered. I could barely hear her, but I immediately stopped. 

She was crying. She rolled over into a ball and just shook all over. I was really scared. I asked if she was ok (stupid question) and she didn't answer. She just shook.

I touched her shoulder, and asked her to please look at me. The look on her face changed my life. She looked completely terrified. “Melissa, it's ok.” I don't even know if she heard me. “It's ok. I'm not going to hurt you.”

She was still crying, and she started whispering, “I'm sorry, I'm so sorry,” over and over again.

I asked if I could hold her, and she let me. I cried too, because here was this woman I loved, obviously in pain, and there was nothing I could do about it. 

Eventually, she calmed down and I walked home. We stayed friends after that, but things had changed. She never looked at me the same way, never touched me again, never kissed me. 

I felt awful. Over Christmas break, she messaged me saying she was sorry for what had happened. I finally realized what had made me feel like shit. It was her saying “I'm sorry.” I asked her what she meant. Sorry for not having sex with me? Sorry for getting raped? Because either one is pretty fucked up. 

She said she knew it sounded stupid, but she felt really guilty about our relationship. She shouldn't have lead me on, she felt bad for thinking she was ready when she wasn't, etc.

I tried to tell her this, and it came out mangled. I'll write it here instead: Melissa, baby, you should never apologize for who you are. I know what you've been through. I know how hard it was to let yourself get close to me, and I am so, so glad you did. You are amazing, beautiful, smart, and wonderful. I love you so much. You deserve so much better than what you've had, and I wish I could make everything better for you. And listen: It wasn't your fault. It's not your fault you were raped. It's not your fault you are still struggling with the emotional fallout. It kills me to hear you say “I'm sorry” for what you've been through. For what you're still going through. Please know that I love you and I want you to be happy, no matter what that means for us. 

And that, reddit, is what turned me into a feminist. This beautiful woman blames herself for what happened to her, and that is fucked up. It's time for shit to change.",,False,,t5_2qr7i,False,,,True,t3_ssmed,http://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/ssmed/why_im_a_feminist_trigger_warning/,

I can't see anything willfully exclusionary about bringing a male perspective to the subjects of fatherhood, masculinity, and biological paternity.


Why does r/feminisms feel the need to put up a facade of inclusion, then exclude voices relevant to their discussions?


If there had been misogynist speech, or trolling, or harassment, or anything approaching exclusionary speech, I would understand the need to protect the safe space. As is, it's pretty evident that these comments were deleted simply because the mods did not agree with the opinions expressed therein.

That doesn't mean I understand what is like to be a woman, just that I understand I am in a privileged position and my life is easier because of my sex. That being said, I notice a conflict that exists between Men's Rights and feminism. And I think the problem is that the Men's Rights crowd isn't understanding the source of the problems they establish. For example, they often mention the very real problem faced by men in child custody and divorce proceedings. But they falter when they blame this problem on a matriarchal society, or some kind of reverse discrimination. The truth is that this issue is derived from a patriarchal way of thinking. Basically, women are seen as child bearers, and as the sex which makes less money, so judge are more likely to award them money and parental duties. Advocating for Men's Rights is not the correct way to fight this. Feminism is. The same goes for something like men being forced to give up their seat for women and that sort of thing. Women are seen as weak and submissive. Fix that to eliminate the problem. Likewise, female on male rape used as comedy will go away when feminism achieve its goal of leveling men and women, because aggressive women will be seen in the same light as aggressive men. So Men's Rights advocates should side with feminism if they want their concerns addressed.",,False,,t5_2qr7i,False,,,True,t3_19np23,http://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/19np23/mens_rights_has_a_point_but_theyre_coming_at_it/,

If she wants to engage in consensual sexual activity with this guy, that's up to her. Likewise it's up to her to decide if this person is right for her/treats her with the same level of respect and decency that should be afforded to any human being.

As her father this guy should be teaching her to be independent and respect herself, not posturing with a gun to scare off other males who might ""damage his property."" 

Also, preemptively, before anyone goes down that ""she's under 18"" road, we don't know that and I don't really think it makes a difference.

I really appreciate each and everyone of your contributions =) You guys rock.**

I'm a bit peeved right now. So I recently got married. We both agreed on me keeping my last name. I've always intended to. It's my identity, I'm working hard to earn my PhD and establish a career as an individual. *I do not want that to just disappear just because I fell in love and got married.*

My husband, however, recently enlisted in the Army (going Special Forces) and in order for me to qualify for spousal benefits I not only have to show proof of our marriage by presenting our marriage certificate (issued and signed by a judge) **BUT** now they're telling me I have to change my last name! Because somehow a marriage certificate isn't enough.

Anyway, so now I'm scouring the internet looking for women who have gone through a similar situation to see if they have any advice...and all I find under ""Is it required to have your last name changed after getting married"" are resources to HELP ME CHANGE MY LAST NAME. Along with articles about how ""Oh I'm a career woman, but now I'm getting married. I'm so torn, but I'll compromise by making my last name my middle name and taking his so I am not disrespectful""

You want to talk disrespectful?! Making me get rid of my identity and name because you need further proof aside from a judge's certification and the ring on my finger that I GOT MARRIED?!

**Rant over.** 

**TL;DR:** *r/feminism, where do you guys stand on surnames and marriage?*

***EDIT*** **Holy crap, #1 on r/feminism? Awesome! Thanks for all the replies and support. To be clear, I fully intend to go in and talk (calmly) about this alleged ""policy"" and sort it out. I just came here guns ablazing and fists swinging because of the staggeringly disappointing results I yielded from an online search that reinforced the expectation of women having to change their names after marriage.

1367432679.0,168,self.Feminism,1dhvng,How to not be a feminist,Jake0024,213,45,103,http://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/1dhvng/how_to_not_be_a_feminist/,"Today I had a real eye-opening experience into how a conservative brain works (and a great lesson in cognitive dissonance to boot, go figure).

I had a conversation with a man who opposes abortion and agrees with Rush Limbaugh that women who use birth control are (and I quote) ""dumb sluts"" but calls himself a feminist because of his racism toward a group of people he thinks treat women badly (*sic--even worse than he does).  Naturally he thinks they should be deported, killed, or at least denied the same rights he himself feels entitled to.

That's his way of standing up for women's rights--he thinks these people should be punished for the way (he imagines) they treat women, so he's a regular hero.  It's like the KKK declaring themselves a bunch of civil rights activists because they spoke out against the Westboro Baptist Church (more accurately, if they spoke out against Baptists in general because they assume they're all like WBC).

To be clear: he is apparently under the impression that Muslims are running around the US *literally beheading women* for things like exposing their ankles in public, and Obama has exempted them from punishment by setting up an alternate legal system just for Muslims based on Sharia law that apparently condones this behavior.

Fox News apparently told him so, and now he thinks he's a hero/feminist for saying we should get rid of all the Muslims, and liberals are actually oppressing women by ""allying"" with Muslims when they say things like ""that's racist, not all Muslims are like that at all.""  You can't keep your woman barefoot and pregnant if she's been beheaded, so he needs to step in and do his manly duty of protecting his damsel by destroying the dark-skinned man.

Apparently he's a grown adult, and also a police officer.

Faith in humanity: -5000

**TL;DR**: if you want to set the women's rights movement back 40 years, you don't get to call yourself a feminist just because you have the ""chivalry"" to hate some ethnic group you stereotype as being even more misogynistic than yourself.",,False,,t5_2qr7i,False,,,True,t3_1dhvng,http://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/1dhvng/how_to_not_be_a_feminist/,

I just wanted to say that for a while I've assumed this was an extremist subreddit, filled by the type of people who are more interested in male inferiority than equality.  

Too often on Reddit I've seen people attacking mostly innocent comments and taking them completely out of context, calling them misogynistic or sexist when they really weren't, whilst the comments that do deserve attacking don't seem to get the same response. I've seen hateful comments against genuine concerns in r/MensRights (note, I don't subscribe there, but what I have read of it seems to have legitimate citations and statistics for their concerns). I've seen ridiculous hateful comments in r/AgainstMensRights, and I'll be honest, I assumed that this is what feminism was truly about.  

I was in r/military a few days ago (I'm not in the military, I just subscribe to it) and I saw a comment attacked for being sexist, just because they used the Marilyn Monroe quote and judged a woman. The attacker said they were going to repost to here, and show that they weren't alone thinking it was sexist.  

I came to read the link (I'm not going to repost it - I'm not looking to bring the poster negative attention), to see how badly this would be taken out of context and, well, it wasn't.  

The people who commented agreed there was nothing wrong with it, and it seemed like everyone downvoted the poster for taking it out of context. The responses were reasonable. I browsed some more of this subreddit, and it surprised me. The links were real concerns I agree with, not blown out of proportion. The discussions were genuine, not hateful or slanderous.  

All I can say is, I'm sorry. I've completely misjudged you, and I tarred a large group of people with the same brush. I've always just assumed this was a hateful forum without checking it out, and in much the same kind of behaviour I detest in others, I've made sweeping generalizations.

I Do Not Want To Work In A Kingdom

Today my boss decided to use my image as a promotional tool. This is not my job. I have signed no release. 

I am a full time editor at a small Production company. I have a BFA in Film and have worked here for almost two years, making me one of the most senior members of the editing staff.  With this comes a heavy workload, and a lot of responsibility. 

Repeatedly, in the last two years, I have been asked to walk my bosses dog, or get coffee, or pick up everyones lunches. When I was the newest member of the team, this seemed fair. It is a regular part of the job of a Production Assistant, and I was happy to have the work. But that is no longer my position at this company, and as an editor with a product deadline to meet, I don't have time for this. We currently have several production assistants whose job this is. But I continue to be asked to perform these tasks.

I have also been directed to be in promotional media from time to time. This includes having my picture in newspaper articles, and acting in pilots for new products. I have represented the company several times in this way. I am the only editor ever told to do this. We do have talent that we hire on an as needed bases, who may be more appropriate to this kind of promotional piece, and who are paid for the use of their image. 

Perhaps you think I should be flattered. You would be wrong.  I am the only young female at this production company. THIS SHOULD MAKE NO DIFFERENCE IN HOW I AM TREATED.

I have never been ASKED to participate in these shoots. I have not been paid for the use of my image. My time, which is needed for the editing projects I was hired to complete, is never considered.  

Today I had an extra heavy workload. But when my boss arrived at work I clearly overhead him discussing, with my fellow co-worker, how I was to act in a promotional commercial. After I overhear this conversation about me, my boss (the CEO of the company) walk by my office with a simple “hi”. 

Despite being one of the most senior editors at this company, I was not consulted on my part in this project. I was not ASKED. 

Later the CEO wanders into my office to borrow some push-pins from my bulletin board. I have decided I have had enough and that I am not ok with being used in things that are far outside my job description, without my consent. I confront my boss. I tell him that I wished to be ASKED when these projects arise, and that my time was very constrained today. I pointed out that there were many other employees with lighter workloads, that could participate in this side project. 

My bosses response was that because I was the most “attractive” employee he had chosen me to be in this commercial. My response : “ That is misogynistic, and unwelcome”. 

This is when I was told to have a private conversation with the CEO. Behind a closed door, in the meeting room, he explained to me about how we valued “teamwork” here, and that he didn't like having employees with “bad attitudes”. 

I responded saying that if he was ASKING me to perform in this pronominal piece based on my acting ability, or based on the amount of free time I had after completing my regular work, it might be appropriate. Appropriate to ASK, not assume. His response was to make it clear that no acting ability was needed, and that I was selected because I was “attractive”. He told me that he did not care if I found this offensive. He then proceeded to tell me that my workplace was not a democracy but a “Kingdom”. He pointed out that since he had used my image in the local newspaper last week that it made sense to use my image again. He had not ASKED to use my image in the paper. This is not a good reason for him to feel he has continued access to the use of my image without my consent. It is an extremely poor justification.

His next words were very carefully selected. “Those who don’t have an attitude of teamwork at this company, will not be eligible for advancement, and may find themselves not employed here anymore.” It was a clear threat to my job, but worded in such a way that there wasn't much to report to HR. He gave himself deniability, while making it clear that I had no choice in the use of my image, and no foothold in fighting against his sexual harassment. 

He then gave me a halfhearted “This isn't in your job description, so you don’t HAVE to do it.” He knew he had backed me into a corner. He would have my image, without my consent, or he would take away my livelihood. 

I weakly reiterated to him that I wished to be ASKED in the future. I wanted him to realize that the use of my image in his side projects should not be assumed. But I felt frightened and defeated. 

As my co-worker set up around me for the commercial shoot, he asked what my boss had said to me. I told him that he had threatened my job if I did not participate in this commercial. My co-worker did not seem surprised. I said “well I think we will see what HR has to say about this”. But my co-worker shot this idea down. “Do you really want to make waves?” he askes me. He reminds me of a former employee who was suddenly fired on a whim from the CEO. “We have a pretty easy gig here,” he tells me “and there will be guys like this CEO everywhere”. 

I then told him something that I think the whole world needs to hear. Yes, right now there are people who think they can manipulate, and threaten their way into what they want. They think they are entitled to anything they want from their employees. They are sure, that with a little pushing, and by instilling a little fear, they can have all the control. 

This can only happen if we allow it to. These people can only act this way if we let them. We can only be trod upon and frightened if we allow it. With an attitude of “There is no place else that would be different or better” and “ It is safer to be quiet and give them what they want” we lose our humanity, and give up our power and control. 

But I am not just an “attractive woman”. I am an educated film editor, who has consistently met deadlines and performed above expectations. I am strong and smart and experienced. I should not have anyone who thinks they can trod on me, or make me feel threatened in my life. 

Today starts my job hunt.  I’m seeking a new team. Not a “Kingdom”, but a safe and welcoming workplace that will treat me like an experienced editor, and a human being. I am not object to look pretty in commercials I will not be taken advantage of. I am not here to fulfill every whim that strikes my bosses fancy. 

I want to work for a functioning company with morals. Not a Kingdom. 


Edit: 
I think some people are missing the most important thing here. He wasn't threatening my job because I protested being in his stupid commercial. It was once I told him that calling me ""attractive"" was UNWELCOME that he shut us in the meeting room and started threatening my job, while asserting that he didn't care if I was offend by being called ""attractive"". And that IS sexual Harassment. He made it clear that ""Being a team player"" meant allowing him to use my ""attractiveness"" to meet his promotional needs, no matter how I felt about it. And that is misogyny. ",,False,,t5_2qr7i,1360808986.0,,,True,t3_18gj5m,http://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/18gj5m/im_trying_to_fight_the_misogyny_in_my_workplace/,

I am just a lurker here, but I can't hold it anymore.

Why is it that when I come to this subredit dedicated to feminism I have to face so much hostility towards the very nature of this community - feminism?

Why is it that when I look through comments, in so many cases the time and energy of the poster is dedicated to the issues extraneous to this reddit?

Yes, we do have recourse of action. Yes, we can report comments that do not follow the rule I quoted in title, and yes, those comments DO get deleted (and thank you mods for that). 

But the point is: the damage is already done by then.

- Comment sections look mutilated, and it is not for our fault. 

- Time and energy that could have gone in helping me and others better understand an issue are devoted to something else, something that does not belong here.

Remember:

**Posters here are REQUIRED to assume the fundamental validity of feminism before posting**. Yes, it is a rule, it is in the sidebar. There is absolutely nothing wrong with you if you choose to believe otherwise; but in that case you shouldn't post here, there are plenty of other places where that would be actually appropriate.

My final comments are:

**To my brothers in /r/mensrights and similar communities**:

- I acknowledge you have grievances, and perhaps *all* of them are legitimate, but please don't bring them here unless they help further the cause of feminism, its understanding, and its practices. Doing otherwise means you are hindering the development of a potential (and in many cases, actual) ally. With this post, I too affirm and claim the rights of subscribers on this subreddit to dedicate themselves here first and foremost to our own issues.

**To my sisters here, and my brothers who embrace feminism**:

- You are doing an excellent job, and I am learning a lot from you all. Please remember we are entitled here to focus first on ourselves and our concerns. I would suggest you report first cases where people transgress our rules; if you do choose to reply to comments not dealing with feminism/contrary to it, the comment you are replying to will likely disappear  - no big deal, just something to keep in mind.

**To our mods**:

- thank you for your great job, I enjoy my time here and the community you help create.

&gt;So, I’m watching this episode of Dexter (Season Six, Episode Four) where Deb has to do a press conference. She’s told she doesn’t look professional, so she has to go buy a skirt suit and wear high heels and pantyhose. She complains about how uncomfortable and painful those accessories are. This made me think about something that is constantly pissing me off.
The idea of job interviews and “looking professional” pisses me off. This sounds ridiculous, but it pisses me off because it means something completely different if you’re a woman.

 
&gt;If you don’t wear make-up you’re considered to look unprofessional. Not only do people think you’re unprofessional, but they think of you as lazy and probably gross. Make-up takes time and money. Men don’t have to wear make-up. Men aren’t constantly told that their natural face is unacceptable for public.
 

&gt;Women are told by society (See: every fucking hair product commercial ever) that long hair is not only the definition of femininity, but what is attractive. If you have short hair you’re considered “alternative” and that makes you look unprofessional. Nevermind that long hair is fucking hard to manage. So, let’s say you are socially acceptable and have long hair. That means you have to make sure you’re hair looks healthy and a natural color. This also means that if your hair isn’t styled, managed, and carefully primped you look “unprofessional.” Women have to spend much more time getting ready than men.
 

&gt;If you have visible leg hair or armpit hair that is, of course, unprofessional.


&gt;Then there’s fucking “dress clothes.” If you go to Walmart a men’s dress shirt is about $5-7, but a women’s dress shirt is $20-30. But of course, your clothes can’t look cheap. That’s goddamn unprofessional. Men’s dress clothes are easily accessible (easy to find and easy to afford). Women’s dress clothes aren’t as easy to find as casual clothes. Women can wear dress pants, but they can’t be too tight. It’s far more acceptable for women to wear a skirt suit. It can’t be any skirt. It must be a tight constricting skirt. It is for looks and obviously not for functionality. You can’t move too much. God forbid you ever have to run from someone. If you can see too much of the ass it’s sleazy and unprofessional. There can’t be cleavage. A woman will be accused of using her body to get ahead. Nothing can be too tight, because that makes a woman look like a “slut.” The clothes can’t be too loose because then it looks like they don’t fit, which is unprofessional. 


&gt;Then there are all the mandatory accessories. Pantyhose which can be constricting, uncomfortable, and they make everyday tasks (like going to the bathroom) more complicated. And of course jewelry is necessary to look professional because you must look like you care about your appearance. So you have to know how to accessorize. High heels are the most professional of shoes. They are also the least practical and most uncomfortable. Also, what’s up with how high heels are associated with professionalism, but also prostitution? All of this costs fucking money. Men do not have to spend this much money or exert this much effort.


&gt;Your hair must look natural (a natural color, not in a mohawk or spikes, etc.), yet your face must look unnatural and you must shave your armpits and legs (which is not natural). The patriarchy does not actually care about looking natural. This society forces women to look like whatever its current ideal is.


&gt;If you are considered unprofessional how are you supposed to ever get a high-paying job? Or even a job that pays at all? Even for fast food interviews you’re required to look professional. If you don’t look professional at “professional” events then you aren’t respected. This society sets women up to fail. Our society doesn’t want women to have jobs. Our society doesn’t want women to be respected.",,False,,t5_2qr7i,1353277882.0,,atheist,True,t3_13egi7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/13egi7/a_really_great_point_i_found_on_looking/,

I tried to think of it the way the mods have put it in the past, that this is about everyone's voice being heard, but the consistent trolling from the likes of OThomson and DavidByron don't represent in any way shape or form the honest sharing of their voice, but rather simply attacks and intentional derailment. 

I considered that this might be about fear, as the MRA community on Reddit is much larger than the feminist community, and there could be consequences if MRA trolls started getting banned from the subreddit... but there are other feminist subreddits that do this and they don't seem to feel the sting of MRA retribution in any way that can't be easily handled. 

I thought it might just simply be not wanting to make the effort, as a policy of banning MRA trolls would probably require much more active moderation. I'd hate to think this is the case, but I don't see any evidence to suggest this. 

I did hear that one of the moderators might be an MRA, but again I've not seen this. 

I've sent in PMs and reports before, about how someone is derailing yet another thread with unrelated discussion about circumcision or male rape or child custody, but there never seem to be any consequences for the trolls. They're given free reign. Some have left the subreddit for safer places, which is very sad indeed. Some simply stop commenting. Some complain, but those complaints fall on deaf ears. 

So, before I call it a day and give up on the subreddit, I'd like to publicly ask the moderators to change their policy for the good of their subreddit. I ask that this subreddit be a safe place to discuss feminism and feminist issues, not a place for MRA trolls to hijack conversation or spread hatred of women. 

Note: I'm not saying critiques of feminism aren't legitimate, or that they don't belong on [/r/Feminism](/r/Feminism), but rather that overt trolling and derailing be disallowed. There's a big difference between an honest critique of feminism and undermining the discussion of feminist issues through derailment, dishonesty, and unwarranted attacks.

I thought that feminism wouldn’t let me view my body as a sexual thing and would make me wear frumpy clothes and shake my fist at any man who expressed interest in me. 

Slowly I realized that feminism is none of those things. It doesn’t mean that I hate men, it means that I respect them even more for believing that they are more than slaves to desire and violence. It doesn’t mean that I have to shun male attention, it just allows me to have enough respect for myself to know the difference between being paid a genuine compliment and being degraded and reduced to a sum of my body parts. Feminism says that my body CAN be a sexual thing; it just doesn’t HAVE to be a sexual thing. It says that I can be proud of my body and sexuality and I don’t have to hide in shame for feelings and desires that belong to humanity as a whole, not just males. It says that I can choose to be sexually active and not be a “slut” or a “whore”. Feminism says that just because I am a woman doesn’t mean that my work is not equal to a man’s or that I deserve to be compensated less. Being a feminist doesn’t mean that I have to be serious all the time, or that I can’t laugh at a well-timed and good-humored joke at my own expense. It just points out that there is a time and a place for everything and that I don’t have to put up with “jokes” that reduce me to a machine for sex and sandwiches. 

I realized that feminism is necessary because we still live in a society that seems to view women as less than human. Society says that a woman is only as good as her body is beautiful. Basically, that a woman only holds value if she is somehow useful to men. In a world where young girls are raped and people ask what she did wrong, where my 7 year old sister has already been told that she is too fat by her peers, where a friend is sexually assaulted and no one seems to think that there was anything wrong with it, in that kind of world I realized that I need feminism. 

This will probably go mostly unnoticed because it is very late, but I just felt like this was something that I needed to say. Thanks for helping me along this journey r/feminism. 


TL;DR I realized that I need feminism because I am a woman, and women don’t deserve to be treated like anything less than they are, human beings.

Your priesthood leader will help assess your responsibility so that, if needed, it can be addressed. Otherwise the seeds of guilt will remain and sprout into bitter fruit. Yet no matter what degree of responsibility, from absolutely none to increasing consent, the healing power of the atonement of Jesus Christ can provide a complete cure.""**
**- Apostle Richard G. Scott ""Healing the Tragic Scars of Abuse,"" General Conference, Ensign, May 1992 — with Richard G. Scott.**

There's layers of problems here, most of which are so obvious they don't need pointing out.  There's the screamingly obvious victim blaming.  There's the lack of awareness that even if the rapist doesn't explicitly or overtly threaten you with physical violence, the simple fact that he pushes on and doesn't care that you want him to stop, that alone is terrifying because if he's capable of that, what else is he capable of?  He's obviously capable of hurting you because he obviously doesn't care that THIS is hurting you, so he doesn't even need to make an explicit violent threat.  The threat is implied, and there, already, *by virtue of the fact that he's willing to rape you.*

Worse, though, is the suggestion that ""the Lord may prompt a victim to recognize a degree of responsibility"" and that ""otherwise the seeds of guilt will remain and sprout into bitter fruit.""  Mormons are very big on ""the promptings of the spirit"" and determining truth through emotions.  Emotions and feelings are interpreted as the holy spirit speaking to you through your emotions to tell you what is true and good and right, and what is not.  

Victims of rape nearly universally report feelings of guilt and self blame.  Also, the worst emotional effects of the rape almost always come well after the attack, as they find themselves triggered by circumstances at all similar to the original attack, or unable to trust or open up or feel safe in sexual relationships.  Doesn't that sound similar to ""seeds of guilt sprouting into bitter fruit"" later on?  That must be God's way of telling you that you have some degree of responsibility for what happened and you didn't properly repent, which is why this has developed into a bigger problem later!

Even if Richard G Scott sounds like he's making a concession in the right direction by saying ""Most often, the victim is innocent because of being disabled by fear or the power or authority of the offender"" - even so, he's really not letting *anyone* feel confident that they are innocent, because everyone is going to recognize themselves as being ""prompted to recognize a degree of responsibility"" and seeing, later on, the ""seeds of guilt remaining and sprouting into bitter fruit"" because these are *near universal consequences of having been raped at all!*

I doubt anyone else is going to be as upset at this quote as I am - after all, it's just some religious nutjob from a quasi-cultlike, or at least very weird religion which nobody takes seriously, right?  The problem is, mormons take it seriously, and being an exmormon myself, I know just how seriously they take it.  Men at the level of Richard G Scott are understood to directly speak with God, and when they speak, they are understood to quite literally speak the mind and will of God to the people.  They are taken very, very seriously, and many members of the mormon church will hate themselves and self-destruct (often quite literally, suicide is not an uncommon outcome for those who have been condemned like this) rather than question the veracity of their leader's words.  Mormons are taught that ""when the prophet has spoken, the thinking has been done"", and a pick-and-choose approach to belief is scorned and condemned.

1368767139.0,119,self.Feminism,1ei1qs,/r/feminisms moderators ham-handedly removing comments that disagree with transphobic radical feminists. Zero explanation is being given. This has been going on for some time.,Jess_than_three,183,64,113,http://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/1ei1qs/rfeminisms_moderators_hamhandedly_removing/,"Just as a PSA for anyone who might be a member of both communities - as I am dead certain that this thread won't be allowed in /r/feminisms itself...

I'll start with the most recent incidents. Here are two threads recently posted in /r/feminisms:

http://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/1e96kr/the_transgender_candidate/

You see a lot of [deleted], but zero moderator posts giving any indication of what's happened. What you *don't* see is a whole bunch of other posts that didn't have responses to them. Here's a selection of removed posts (obviously mine are the only ones I have access to):

* [A detailed explanation of why the idea that acceptance of transgender people is positively correlated with homophobia and misogyny is horseshit.](http://i.imgur.com/paTR3On.png)

* /u/Granny_Weatherwax [asked whether veronalady had linked to her own blog, and noted she should seek help for her unhealthy obsession](http://i.imgur.com/FOlZwaw.png) (note: [she has acknowledged that it is](http://i.imgur.com/d7Q5Jof.png)), and I [linked another of her blog posts for reference](http://i.imgur.com/eRUGK3Z.png).

* Here, [two different lengthy posts have been removed](http://i.imgur.com/dvrgWbX.png). It certainly isn't okay to expect people to take responsibility for their hateful speech.

* Granny_Weatherwax linked [this image](http://i.imgur.com/id5R5.jpg). /u/girlsoftheinternet responded completely off-topic, complaining that Serano didn't ""make the case convincingly at all that trans women are female"". [Apparently noting that that doesn't have anything to do with anything isn't allowed.](http://i.imgur.com/r6Is2kO.png)

* [This is the comment chain I referred to above](http://i.imgur.com/pT2dKIi.png), noting that I was ""still waiting"". The ""So rebut it"" link goes to the first post above - the lengthy look at what was wrong with veronalady's ""isn't it interesting?"" BS (which hadn't been removed at the time, but is now).

BTW, for /u/Granny_Weatherwax's removed comments in that thread, you can dig back a couple of pages in her profile.

The second thread:

http://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/1e2mk6/who_owns_gender_trouble_and_strife/

* [Here are a bunch of removed comments.](http://i.imgur.com/gHn3G9H.png) The first several are mostly bickering - fair enough. But then again, we see lengthy discussion and argumentation removed - with the TERF posts left standing.

As an aside, funny story: yellowmix has decided that the term ""TERF"" (which stands for variations on ""trans-exclusionary radical feminist"", and is a hell of a lot nicer than other terms I've seen used, like ""badfem"", ""radscum"", or ""shithead"") isn't acceptable (because it ""attacks feminists"") and has threatened to ban people for using it. Meanwhile, calling trans women ""men"" is a-okay.

* [Here's a discussion of Julia Serano's ideas](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/1e2mk6/who_owns_gender_trouble_and_strife/c9z1s1i?context=3). Hey, it looks mostly intact! Cool. But wait, [what's that [deleted\] at the end](http://i.imgur.com/NUwtaKa.png)? Add ""questioning TERFs as to their actual, specific beliefs"" to the list of things that aren't allowed on /r/feminisms.

* Oh, but [telling people ""FUCK YOU""](http://i.imgur.com/r3AEuU2.png)? Nothing wrong there - at least, if you're a TERF talking to a trans woman.

Oooof course.

Moving on...

A few months back, in [a thread about Wordpress ostensibly shutting down Gendertrender](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/16w6st/if_you_care_about_the_censorship_of_women_read/), /u/girlsoftheinternet asks, in response to complaints about the cissexist shit being posted, ""should they ban us then?"". [Lengthy response answering that question in good faith? Removed.](http://i.imgur.com/gCLRtFX.png)

[As always, criticizing the moderation is strictly disallowed.](http://i.imgur.com/THLe940.png)

[Disagreeing with radfems](http://i.imgur.com/q7xrZin.png) *really* [isn't allowed](http://np.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/16w6st/if_you_care_about_the_censorship_of_women_read/c804jny).

[Nor here](http://np.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/16w6st/if_you_care_about_the_censorship_of_women_read/c80jcy6): [original post](http://i.imgur.com/rcchHbk.png)

Note that this thread was tagged as ""BRIGADE WARNING"", despite pretty much everyone present being regular /r/feminisms users, and the thread not having been linked anywhere - on the basis, as far as I can tell, of a bunch of trans users arguing. That **must** mean there's some kind of brigade going on, right?! 

[I posted a thread about this](http://i.imgur.com/Vqn0Eii.png), but of course, predictably, it was censored. When I messaged their modmail, I was told by yellowmix (who is the only /r/feminisms moderator who has *ever* responded to *anything* - and I'm pretty sure until recently they were the *only* active moderator) that that was because they were ""planning to post a meta thread on the subject soon"". [They did post a survey](http://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/1722uf/community_feedback_session_the_inaugural/) that seems likely to have been on this subject (evidently I missed it when it was going on - go figure), but no follow-up ever occurred, and there's no indication of what the results were, much less of anything ever coming of it. 

[Here's an incredibly nasty post about how trans women aren't *real* women.](http://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/15od3l/natalie_reed_4th_wave_transfeminism/c7ra64g) Gosh - I wonder what all that ""[deleted]"" is? Among other things, [this](http://i.imgur.com/cASyfpk.png). I can't screenshot the rest of it, as it was posted by others.

[Here's a *lovely* example of a submission *I* think should be worth of a moderator warning if not an outright ban. I wonder how the comments look?](http://www.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/18m7k2/we_have_the_right_to_discuss_female_genital/)

* [\[deleted\]](http://i.imgur.com/vZF5bwX.png) (the extra posts from me are trying reposting segments of the comment separately, to see which ""objectionable"" part would be removed; it was all of it)

* [\[deleted\]](http://i.imgur.com/jf8Jy2V.png) (yeah, it was pretty hostile, but with good fucking reason)

* twofer: [\[deleted\]](http://i.imgur.com/tbEBy4v.png) (DO NOT DISAGREE WITH THE RADFEMS) and [\[deleted\]](http://i.imgur.com/RjdoQzF.png) (DO NOT QUOTE THE RADFEMS' OWN WORDS)

* [\[deleted\]](http://i.imgur.com/pT7G4RS.png) (DO NOT POINT OUT THAT THE RADFEMS' ANGER AND VITRIOL ARE DIRECTED AT PEOPLE WHO AREN'T EVEN RELEVANT TO THE ISSUE AT HAND)

* [\[deleted\]](http://i.imgur.com/8RM7NeH.png) (DO NOT QUESTION RADFEMS' MISGENDERING)

* [\[deleted\]](http://i.imgur.com/qpJl3QZ.png) (DO NOT THROW RADFEMS' OWN TERRIBLE ARGUMENTS BACK IN THEIR FACES)

[Here's a thread disagreeing with Julie Burchill and her awful shit.](http://np.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/16hroq/julie_burchill_dont_you_dare_try_to_suggest_that/)

* [This comment](http://np.reddit.com/r/feminisms/comments/16hroq/julie_burchill_dont_you_dare_try_to_suggest_that/c7wsskk?context=2) *wasn't* deleted, surprisingly, but the lack of response and the continued moderation sure does speak volumes. Staggering hypocrisy.

* The highlighted comment in this screenshot was [\[deleted\]](http://i.imgur.com/InvZ9NV.png). ""You are free to critique [generally recognized feminism variant theories]"" (unless I don't like your critique)? 

* [\[deleted\]](http://i.imgur.com/QTNd4Tu.png) (Accuse someone of vote cheating? Okay (wait, ""critique the theory and not the person"" what?). Defend yourself against this claim? NOT OKAY.)

[Here's a person who got *banned* from the subreddit for pointing this shit out.](http://www.reddit.com/r/TransphobiaProject/comments/172bmd/got_banned_from_rfeminisms_for_highlighting/)

[Here's a thread from eight months ago talking about /r/feminisms' moderators silencing trans people's perspectives in the name of protecting against ""criticism of feminists"".](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSGSM/comments/zrehv/rfeminisms_is_still_being_quietly_transphobic/)

(**Brief aside**: it's not acceptable to ""criticize feminists"" in any way. Okay, sure! But these people are *identifying themselves as ""trans-critical feminists""* - they are actively criticizing trans people, trans people who are feminists, and trans feminism as a perspective. BUT WAIT, I THOUGHT IT WASN'T OKAY TO CRITICIZE FEMINISTS OF ANY KIND?)

[Here's a post from **over a year ago** talking about *this same fucking issue*.](http://www.reddit.com/r/TransphobiaProject/comments/kamb7/more_trans_related_posts_removed_in_rfeminisms/)

[Here's another one, this one talking specifically about removal of posts related to the controversy surrounding the Michigan Women's Music Festival (and their policy of not allowing trans women to attend).](http://www.reddit.com/r/TransphobiaProject/comments/kbgz3/not_waiting_any_longer_to_make_a_statement/)

There are more examples, to be sure, but I've since lost them.

**This is an ongoing problem with /r/feminisms.** It claims to be ""inclusive"", but while it's totally allowed for people to shit all over trans women (while pretending trans men don't exist, of course), it's *not* okay to argue back.

In the absence of literally any response or feedback explaining why post after post, comment after comment, has been deleted, all I can see is that the moderators (or more likely just yellowmix, who again seems for a long time to have been the *only* moderator who had been active on reddit in months, before bringing on a few new people only recently) are protecting their TERF buddies and silencing people who disagree with them.",,False,,t5_2qr7i,False,,trans,True,t3_1ei1qs,http://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/1ei1qs/rfeminisms_moderators_hamhandedly_removing/,

""Because the present study found no evidence that feminists
are hostile toward men and, in fact, found that nonfeminists
reported higher levels of hostility toward men than
did feminists, a larger question remains:What accounts for
the persistence of the stereotype that feminists are man
haters? 

Feminism as a political, ideological, and practical
paradigm offers a critique of systems of gender stratification
and, simultaneously, encourages equality. Perhaps there is
a “unit of analysis” confusion whereby feminist critiques of
patriarchy are confused with specific complaints about particular
men and women’s interpersonal relationships with
men. Feminism itself entails an interrogation of the system
of male dominance and privilege and not an indictment of
men as individuals. 

To the extent that individual men exhibit
sexist attitudes, feminist analysis focuses on the social
institutions and ideologies that produce such behavior""",[Study],False,,t5_2qr7i,False,resolved,transnational,True,t3_sve3b,http://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/sve3b/study_are_feminists_man_haters_feminists_and/,

Thank you for all your comments! Especially SubredditDrama and, apparently, SRS and anti-SRS. Those goons are bred of dolphin powered Internet hate, and their dildo swords are mighty and large.I look forward to being Reddit-stalked harder, longer, faster, and stronger by many more r/Mensrights-ers.

We can bro-down anytime.








This ain't a scene, it's a troll space.

There are many, MANY good places on the Internet to debate feminist thought and theory and discuss feminism. This place is not one of them. It has devolved into a cesspool of defensiveness for [/r/Mensrights](/r/Mensrights) who never thought for a single second to actually change their views. Since I listed this joke of a subreddit 99% of the replies to every comment and post I have gotten here has been met with a resounding grunt once [/r/Mensrights](/r/Mensrights) got a hold of it and called me for a harlot. Isn't that sad?

I get guys necro-ing my threads all the time; not just here but in other threads I comment in too. I get followed. Anywhere else it would be flattery; here it is a black snake. This subreddit is a liability. You subscribe here, you comment here, and the message is clear: it is ANYTHING but a safe space. You will be followed. You will be downvoted en masse. You will be haunted. You are marked.

My blog gets upvotes. Other feminists love it. I am not off the mark in what I say. I am passionate but never ill informed. I am as active and informed as they come both here and in other subreddits. But this one is becoming a hazard. Could it be, perhaps, that this subreddit isn't the hotbed of serious feminist debate it thinks it is? Could it be that [/r/Feminism](/r/Feminism) has been LEFT BEHIND? Could it be that working together isn't happening, and a new approach is needed? Could it be that this isn't raising awareness, only hate for women?

Don't even get me STARTED on how entitled it is to call [/r/feminisms](/r/feminisms) a ""safe space."" Cram it, sisters. You don't get to call a subreddit with Susan B. Anthony on it's header and Audrey Lorde quotes ""safe"" just because you decided it would be a nice idea to let r/mensrights make a mockery of discussion. That's not bravery, that's not wit. That's bullshit. That's lazy. There is a reason no one believes it. Keep trying the 4chan approach to monitoring comments, and keep falling behind. That's not the way the world is going. 

Anonymous dickery is many- veined plant, and if you create a garden for it to thrive it's seeds are in no shortage, for idiocy in the world is a weed. And I ain't no dandelion farmer.

I hold events in a different subreddits at my house for various gaming/local events. People on that subreddit know my address, I post it there. Based on the comments and the hate I have got here from r/mensrights, my fiance asked me to discontinue the events. I declined. I will continue my events and to hell with r/mensrights, and to hell with this subreddit which offers them haven to be as big of asses they want. 

And who's going to complain to the mods? Free speech right? If you don't like it, go somewhere else! Seems like a lot of people are taking this subreddit at it's word lately. I'm just one more but believe it: I won't be the last.

So, I know you don't care about me. I'm just some random loser on the Internet, who gives a damn? Why should you care? Why revamp? Why even have a goddamn Twitter? You did your job, this is what it is, right? What the fuck do I know now? Why change the rules?

Well, what could the potential be without the trolls and their comments which constantly derail threads and bring us down? That I do know: somewhere Feminists could be proud to speak, and to be heard, sisters.

Quote:

&gt;**Reddit: Mens Rights**

&gt;A “subreddit” of the user-generated news site Reddit, this forum describes itself as a “place for people who feel that men are currently being disadvantaged by society.” While it presents itself as a home for men seeking equality, it is notable for the anger it shows toward any program designed to help women. It also trafficks in various conspiracy theories. “Kloo2yoo,” identified as a site moderator, writes that there is “undeniable proof” of an international feminist conspiracy involving the United Nations, the Obama Administration and others, aimed at demonizing men.

Chalk it up to the feminists try to keep men down, amirite? To all sensible people that browse MR, I would suggest unsubscribing, in the same way that you wouldn't subscribe (hopefully) to a racist, sexist, or homophobic subreddit. To all people who seriously value gender equality: don't feed the trolls.

**EDIT**: It's been suggested, since I advocated to all sensible subscribers of /r/MR that they unsubscribe, that I bring attention to the fact that **/r/masculism is a subreddit also interested in Men's Rights**, but that isn't considered a hate group, and AFAIK and from casual inspection does not appear to promote hateful content. I would recommend checking that out instead.

A large part of the debate here seems to be whether a) /r/MR *really* is a hate group, and b) should the problems that are there be worked on (i.e. fix that subreddit) or should people migrate/start over with an explicit mission to avoid the problems there in mind? In my experience on reddit, fixing a subreddit is rarely successful; I'd imagine having extremely negative recognition from outside reddit only amplifies that problem. My thoughts on (a) and (b) should be obvious, I just wanted to bring to everyone's attention that an alternative to /r/MR already exists, if they are so interested.",,False,,t5_2qr7i,True,,,True,t3_qo61a,http://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/qo61a/rmensrights_is_now_recognized_as_a_hate_group_by/,

1374766000.0,108,self.Feminism,1j15sb,"I'm not sure if this belongs here, but I need to vent.",Naughtalice,139,31,88,http://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/1j15sb/im_not_sure_if_this_belongs_here_but_i_need_to/,"I've recently started dating after being single for over a year. In previous relationships I was young and not making much money so going out to eat was rare. I now work a ridiculous schedule, making decent money, and on my few days off I'd rather go out to eat than spend my limited free time in the kitchen. Because of this, I'm not sure if this behavior is the norm and I'm just noticing or if it's a regional thing. 

When my boyfriend and I go out to eat I usually pay. I receive a steady paycheck, he is an artist who gets paid by the piece. When he has the money he pays but I don't see a problem in paying when I can afford it. 

After a few dates I noticed a pattern. The wait staff leaves the bill, I get my card out, put it in with the bill, the staff runs the card and returns it along with the receipt to be signed and places them in front of my boyfriend. Every. Damn. Time. 

Once I noticed it, it could not be unseen. Every time it happened I could feel myself getting more and more frustrated. I could understand them being busy (even though we often eat at off times in an attempt to avoid families with children) and not noticing who put the card in, but did they not even look at the card when they ran it? If they it would be clear who to give the receipt and card to. 

I didn't feel like confronting the staff was appropriate since we usually eat at different restaurants each time but I wanted someone to acknowledge what was happening and validate how I was feeling. I brought it to the attention of my boyfriend after lunch one day. As I was putting the card in with the bill I told him to watch who they handed it to. He was amazed. He had never noticed it happening before. 

He apologized profusely and I explained that it wasn't my intent to make him feel bad, I just wanted to vent a bit and bring it to his attention. He was very confused and didn't understand why they would do that. I explained that ""culturally"" the man pays for meals so that's who they return the check to and that it is really offensive to me. It makes me feel like I'm worth less than him because I am a woman.

Now when we go out to eat and they return my card to my boyfriend he makes it a point to bring it to the attention of the staff that it needs to be handed to me. I love that he understands how I feel and doesn't dismiss my feelings. 

Tl;Dr Waitstaff always gives my credit card to my bf at the end of our meals, he understands it bothers me and makes it a point to correct them. Is this the norm in restaurants?

Since I am pregnant I am in the purgatory of parenthood. I'm already feeling the weight of the responsibility but am still my own person.

While I've been pregnant it seems I have somehow got accepted into this secret society I always knew existed but never took time to acknowledge. I have this new street cred that I never bothered to care about achieving.

I tread lightly with this notion and have decided feminism was the best subreddit because this sacred street cred is held above all non-child baring individuals and dangled like a fashionable prize only given to the ""chosen ones"" and frankly, it pisses me off... And I figure you ladies would be open minded enough to hear me out.

I get that having a baby and actually birthing a child is monumental and scary as well as beautiful and the most womanly ""thing"" one can do. It's the divider that allows women to officially say, ""Women can while men can't"" BUT with all of that... Why drag our fellow women down? Children or not I felt like I could tackle the planet, help mold minds and be everything I've ever wanted.

Now I keep being told, ""You are accomplished now because you will have spawn. You've created a new generation."" Uhhh, no. There are many things that can be accomplished that are of grand importance... Maybe even more important than procreation.

I may be alone in this, but I feel like every time I hear, ""There is nothing better than being a parent"" it makes me feel like it cheapens the accomplishments of all of those childless but very accomplished scientists, poets, CEOs, creaters and artists.

As a woman who's had an abortion, it's hard enough as it is to make this decision and go through with it without having to jump through loop holes. Why did I choose to have an abortion? Because I watched my two sisters get treated like incubators by the men who knocked them up, that's why. I m not an incubator. I am not a breeder. I may be a woman, but goddamn I am also a human being, and just because a man figured out how to ejaculate in me does not give him the right to make decisions over my body. I understand a counterarguement here could be that I should have used the proper precaution. Well I did. That's why these things are called accidents. Or, one could argue abstinence. Alright, I can take the fault for that. But let's be realistic here - I'm a 22 year old lower middle class white female raised in a non-religious household. Sex is happening. So an irresponsible young female with no income gets impregnated by an irresponsible young male with no income. Do either of them deserve to have children? I can't speak for him, but I feel that I did not deserve to have a child. More importantly, that child did not deserve to be born into the hostile and unstable world I currently call my reality. Sure, I have regret. I could have been a mother, maybe even a wife. That baby could have been the beginning of a family. That child could have grown up to be a great person despite all odds. But that's selfish, masturbatory, and unrealistic. But I don't regret the abortion as much as I regret the sexual encounter itself. If I would have avoided that one night, that ONE night out of a million billion, then I could have avoided the hate, shame, embarrassment, and alienation of an abortion. I don't regret ending the development of an embryo. But I regret having to look that living, breathing, conscious, and feeling man straight in the eye and tell him what I had to do. I regret having to beg my mother for the money. I regret having to hide the pregnancy from my father. And I regret having to make the decision to have an abortion. Terminating the pregnancy was the best decision I ever made. Having sex without wanting to have a baby was the worst. It's all butt sex and lesbianism from here.",,False,,t5_2qr7i,False,,,True,t3_ysdjq,http://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/ysdjq/a_call_for_more_women_to_share_their_abortion/,

Because, in this context, what does the word ""girly"" mean?  Is it the Disney version of ""girly,"" filled with ponies and bows and the colors pink and purple and i's dotted with hearts?  Is it the Sex and the City version of trendy chic, vapid materialism, and vanity?  Is it an attraction to muscular men?  Is it liking to wear makeup and high heels and form-fitting dresses and perfume?  Does it mean liking to cook, taking the subservient role in a relationship, being a caretaker for children?

I object, and to my mind, feminism should reject, the idea of taking any collection of nominally-unrelated traits, bundling them together as a unit, and assigning a name to it that is indicative of one particular sex or gender identity.  It doesn't matter how frequently those traits do or do not occur together in reality.  It doesn't matter that those traits tend to have a concordance with gender identity.  That relationship isn't categorical and we shouldn't treat it as such.

So I'd be a very happy fellow if this meme went away.

A woman with a collection of Prada bags and Gucci heels can still be a feminist.  A stay-at-home mom can still be a feminist.  A woman who likes unicorns and pink ponies and rainbows can still be a feminist.  A woman who is sexually submissive and attracted to muscular men can still be a feminist.  Of course that's all true.  But I think a feminist *should* reject the idea of seriously calling herself or anyone else ""girly"" or ""femme"" or ""feminine"" or any of these terms, and they should not associate their enjoyment of their designer clothes, parenting duties, Disney paraphernalia, or sexual submission with their gender.  It stands against what I hope we're all standing for.

I have multiple sisters and 2 of them have little girls. I was visiting my mom's this past weekend to spend some time with the family. I don't remember how this conversation came up but I encouraged my nieces to travel the world and attend university outside of the city they grew up in. I was given this advice by a teacher at an early age, followed it, and I believe it's helped me grow tremendously and given me the self-confidence I don't believe I would have had without these experiences.

My sisters FLIPPED OUT. They started shouting at me about how everyone is different, not everyone needs to ""run away"" from their families, etc. 

Then they proceed to tell me that all they want for their girls is to ""find a good man to take care of them."" Wtf? Seriously? You don't want your kids to learn how to survive on their own? You don't want them to be successful on their own merit? You just want them to find their self-worth through a man?

Ugh. Made me sick to my stomach. I just looked at my  niece and said ""Do it! DON'T GO TO SCHOOL IN THIS TOWN! MOVE AWAY! MOVE AWAY!""

They are basically raising their kids to be co-dependent with them, and telling them to transfer this co-dependency to a man in the future. Ugh!!!!!! 

I get that part of it is they love their kids and they don't want to be too far from them, but why encourage them to find happiness only in marriage instead of through their education or through their own success?

TLDR: Sisters are extremely sexist and passing this sexism down to my nieces, their daughters, and it makes me sick to my stomach.",,False,,t5_2qr7i,False,,,True,t3_vqv29,http://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/vqv29/my_sisters_behavior/,
1339850667.0,93,self.Feminism,v4xth,Why feminism gets the 'Friend Zone' wrong.,ThrowawayFeminist,144,51,159,http://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/v4xth/why_feminism_gets_the_friend_zone_wrong/,"Buckle in. This is going to be a long one.

I imagine just about all of the regulars on this subreddit will already be familiar with the concept of the friend zone, but I'll give a brief run-down just in case you aren't. Sexually frustrated men on the internet commonly complain about something called the friend zone, a place they wind up when their interest in a woman gives them a friendship rather than the romantic relationship they had hoped for. This is sometimes stated in very confrontational terms, with men accusing women of consistently choosing to have relationships with assholes, while nice guys (the person writing the complaint is always a 'nice guy') get put in the friend zone. The feminist response to this has been to point out that women are not machines  which dispense sex in exchange for kindness, that it is their right to choose sexual partners however they want, and that men who think otherwise are certainly not 'nice guys'. I don't disagree with any point of the feminist response, but I think it misses a fundamental feature of the way the term 'friend zone' is used.

To illustrate this, I have to go into some of my own personal history. I was a fairly awkward and not particularly physically attractive guy throughout high school and my undergraduate university years. I was also a bit of a jerk sometimes. I had a handful of relationships, but they never went very far and the majority of my time was spent as a lonely, sexually frustrated single person. I'm not saying this to get pity-I'm past that point in my life now-but to illustrate how my romantic pursuits tended to unfold during that time. 

My understanding of relationships came from the same place where I imagine it comes from for all inexperienced teenagers: pop culture. Pop culture romances start in one of two ways: men and women meet for the first time due to some random happen stance, or they have known one another and had romantic tension for their entire lives. They wind up spending some time together-often also due to random happen-stance, and at a suitably dramatic moment, a first kiss materializes out of nowhere. Then there's usually some drama, and if the movie/TV show/song/book/comic book/video game/whatever has a happy ending, they wind up as a happy couple as the curtain falls. It would be beating a dead horse to point out everything that is wrong with this view of relationships, but as a teenager I had no better information than this. This resulted in my belief that all that needs to happen for a relationship to materialize between two people is for them to spend time together.

With this very flawed view of human relations in hand, I set out trying to find a girlfriend. Unsurprisingly, this resulted in many failures. Usually the story would go something like this: I'd meet a girl and develop an attraction for her during the first few times we were in each other's company. I'd then find a way to arrange for us to be alone together. In high school this would usually involve doing something innocuous like working together on a class project or walking home together, while in undergrad I was able to work up the courage to ask women to go see a movie. In all of these cases, if we got along well then we would keep spending time together, and I would keep expecting that Hollywood kiss to materialize. Unsurprisingly it never did, and I would be left with a friendship. With the benefit of hindsight I am actually happy that this is how it worked out in a number of cases, as I made a lot of good friends this way. But at the time, as this cycle kept repeating itself, it became extremely frustrating as I watched my male friends find girlfriends while I continually got stuck in what is now called the friend zone.

The obvious feminist response to this story is that the whole thing was my fault. I had a flawed view of how relationships worked, and this played a role in sabotaging my efforts at finding one. The thing that most feminists don't realize is that *I knew this was the case*. I realized that the problem was with me, and that there was some fundamental way I was failing to communicate my romantic interest to women. I understood that women had no obligation to sleep with me in exchange for me being nice. When I complained about the friend-zone, all the criticism was self-directed. **I believed that I was friend-zoning myself, and this was the source of my frustration and my reason for using the term.**

I realize that my experience doesn't reflect that of all romantically frustrated men, and there are plenty of guys out there who do think they are entitled to sex, and who do use the term ""friend-zone"" as a way of denying women's agency, and I realize that perhaps the term is irreversibly tainted from that association. But the feminist response to male sexual frustration has been what I see as largely unwarranted hostility. Men expressing their frustration are accused of de-humanizing women. This may sometimes be the case, but in many cases these men are simply crying out for advice on how to better communicate their desires. 

Of course, it isn't feminism's job to solve frustrated single guy's problems. Feminists have much bigger fish to fry than that. But I can think of two reasons why this should matter to feminists:

1) The frustration I described is a side-effect of rape culture. The view that romance and sex just happen when the time and the mood are right is a view that completely negates the concepts of communication and consent. Obviously women are by far the greater victims of this view-they are most often the ones who get assaulted-but this is a good example of an issue in which patriarchy trumps both men's and women's interests. If a blow can be dealt to rape culture by extending a bit more empathy to frustrated men, then that's a win-win situation. This is a good reason to advocate more comprehensive sex ed in schools that provides useful information and advice about healthy relationships, and a good reason to advocate pop culture that takes a more realistic view of relationships.

2) Organized misogyny, in the form of the Men's Rights Movement and especially the pick-up artist community, preys on sexually frustrated guys and promises them a way to end their frustration. I myself considered myself a men's rights activist for a while. Had I not been exposed to feminist philosophy through some of my classes, I might still be one. Male sexual frustration is a powerful recruiting tool for the people who want to turn back the clock on women's rights. Feminism can combat this by openly acknowledging men's problems and showing ways they can be addressed in a way that is consistent with gender equality. At the very least, feminists should avoid pushing away men who make these complaints by assuming that their actions come from a de-humanization of women.

It's often said by feminists that the human race has spent 8000-odd years hearing men's stories and perspectives, but I don't think this is true. I think that the masculine perspectives purveyed by mainstream culture are more likely to be patriarchal masculine myths, which have about as much to do with men's lived experience as Cosmopolitan Magazine has to do with women's. Patriarchy hurts everybody, and coming to a better understanding of how it hurts everybody can only be a good thing.

I rolled my eyes. He wasn’t exactly the funniest guy I knew. Actually, he irritated me quite often. But I decided to humor him, out of some unfathomable kindness that overtook me in that moment, perhaps spawning from pity.

“Sure” I said.

“Women’s rights!” 

He proceeded to crack up for about thirty seconds, and then suddenly seemed to notice my stone cold face. 

The next ten minutes were sort of a blur. 

I remember saying how he was actually correct. Women have no rights, it was a joke, if we can’t walk down the road in the clothing of our choice without the fear of being sexually assaulted, and worse, blamed for it. 

We have no rights, I began shouting, if I make less money than my male equivalent coworker.

We have no rights if I’m walking on my way home from school, and I’m honked at, making me feel dehumanized and uncomfortable. 

We have no rights if a man can have sex with whomever he wishes and be made to feel like a hero, but when a woman chooses to express her sexual liberty, she is accused of being a slut, a whore, and a prostitute by not only men but other women.

We have no rights, if women are hired less when they aren’t wearing makeup.

We have no rights if women cannot be taken seriously in official positions if they are not considered attractive enough. 

We have no rights if women are widely portrayed as shallow, vapid shells online and in television.

We have no rights if we are considered ugly by men and women if we do not live up to beauty standards the media set.

We have no rights if I felt like I needed to starve myself so people would find me more beautiful and like me more.

We have no rights if a woman is bashed for “friendzoning”,  simply refusing to date someone they didn’t want to.

We have no rights if I have to be telling you this right now, why your joke offended me, and expect you to call me a bitch, uptight, and a feminist.  

I sort of calmed down at that point. 

“I just want to have the same rights as men. No more, and no less. I don’t think making light of it is funny. It matters a lot to me.” I said.

“Geez, it was a joke. Don’t get your panties in a bunch.”

I'm fifteen right now. I feel like I'm the only one who cares as much as I do. And it's hard to not give up. No one my age sees what I see.

It really does just destroy any chance at real, healthy discussions about not just women's issues, but feminism as a whole. It seems to me like most of the comments section is misogynistic huffing and puffing or disregarding real claims with unnecessary ""Well, this happens to men too! Why are you ignoring us?"". My answer to that seems really simple. Feminism exists (and /r/feminism, actually) because women's issues are hardly the forefront of most news sources or government institutions. We talk about women and how events in the real world affect women because that's what the core of feminism is about. (Not to say that gender norms/patriarchy doesn't affect men as well, but there are posts about men that can be made to the subreddit and can in fact lead to very interesting discussions.) I don't think it's healthy to exclude any group or gender from a discussion, but if women's issues and feminism makes you angry to even see it discussed, I would ask you politely to please mind your own business so that the rest of us can enjoy our time on the internet.",,False,,t5_2qr7i,False,,,True,t3_wgtjs,http://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/wgtjs/about_a_trend_that_i_continue_seeing/,

He's a pretty good guy, until recently, he's done a pretty good job at being progressive minded.

So, he's had some pretty unfortunate experiences with women throughout his life. (Verbally abusive mother and 2 horrible ex girlfriends).

His first ex who he dated for almost a year was about as horrible as people get (manipulation, controlling behavior, verbal abuse etc). He finally ended it after she broke his laptop. After that whole ordeal, he was depressed for a while but managed to still keep a ""I just found a bad apple, not all women are like that"" attitude. A while later, he started seeing another woman and she was much nicer to him. They dated for around half a year until he found out she was cheating on him with an old flame.

The second time around, he wasn't quite as resilient, and I can't really hold it against him after what he's been through. Since then, he's been posting a lot of misogynistic crap to Facebook (A voice for men, traditionalism and crap articles like that). A lot of our friends have called him out and deleted him from Facebook, most of them refuse to hang out with him any more and are pretty much just calling him an asshole behind his back and pretty much isolating him.

Now, I'm not trying to make excuses for the things he says and posts, and I've told him several times that I know he's been through a lot of shit, but he's dealing with it in a really inappropriate way. He keeps ""refuting"" me by bringing up those tumblr fringe feminist blogs and saying that he has a right to hate women after his experiences with them.

I'm not really sure how to react. He is being a total shithead, I know, but his friends all judging him and alienating him isn't really helping either. It's been 2 months since the break up. Should I give him more time? Should I take a tougher ""dude, you're being a total asshole"" approach? Should I just sit back and let him do his own thing?

This whole ordeal is creating a lot of drama for me. Friends want me to ditch him, and he thinks that my friends are brainwashed by feminism. I feel like I have to pick sides right now, and I'm not quite sure what I can do without having to pick a side.

TL;DR: Best friend has turned into a misogynist after being screwed over by 3 women. Friends are dropping him. What should I do?",,False,,t5_2qr7i,False,,,True,t3_1al9bw,http://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/1al9bw/my_best_friend_is_turning_into_a_misogynist_and/,

I am furious but mostly really sad that she is thinking this way. Also I want to throw up. I thought I would share it so people could be angry with me.

In unrelated news certain people will be removed from my friends list.

""Amidst my paper writing (or procrastination of my paper writing), I have come to a huge life realization. Feminists have ruined my life as well as the lives of women all around. I am going through pain, stress, agony, and you know what? Women never needed these types of stress. If it weren't for those feminist bitches saying ""hey, I want a real job! I want to compete with the boys and go to school!"" I could have been married off by now chilling in a house cooking up some homemade mac and cheese while cleaning living what I like to call ""the dream"". 

Who says cleaning does not provide a satisfying life?? Does one not like taking something completely messy and turning it into something beautiful and clean?? Who doesn't like to make people happy through feeding them deliciousness? Does writing a philosophical paper about Aquinas truly make myself and everybody else around me happy? Fuck no. It just adds stress and makes me miserable. So as a true woman, I want my rights to the kitchen and housework back.

Feminists, there are some things in life that men just do better. Accept it. Men get stuff done with no bullshit. Women, on the other hand, complain in the process, and over think everything. We (women) are whiny bitches and need to slow our rolls. We have our own type of power that men will never possess that we must acknowledge though, and that is the power of the puss. With great power come great responsibility. Having a vagina gives us the power to manipulate men, find a rich person, and live the lazy, home-filled, child bearing life we deserve. 

We must embrace cleaning, embrace being able to wear makeup, grow out that shiny hair, embrace those tits and hips because we are made to show them and NOT made to hide them in a library slaving away on papers. Women are the necks that turn the heads. and we come up with the ideas but since all women do is ramble (like I am doing now), we can never implement ideas. Hence why men run everything. A man is nothing without a woman to take care of him, and how are men going to get to work without somebody taking care of them in the home? They won't. That is why it is our duties as women to go back into the house and make sure our men are happy and fed to run our world.

So my fellow women, let us take back what is ours. Let us regain our natural rights as women and provide for our families and be that solid foundation for the men of the world. Lest we forget, this is a man's world. But it wouldn't be nothing without a woman or a girl.

Feminists, stop thinking we are equal. WE ARE NOT. Stop fighting because there are women who like their place in the world and you're fucking us over. I like being a woman, I like cooking, I like cleaning, and you're pushing me to be something I'm not. So stop trying to be a man and put on a fucking dress and accept yourselves for what you are - women.

Okay, I'm done ranting. The end. Back to finals.""",,False,,t5_2qr7i,False,,,True,t3_14rwkl,http://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/14rwkl/college_girl_refutes_over_150_years_of_feminism/,
1350194948.0,79,self.Feminism,11g8uo,Went to get a drink; acquaintance threatened to rape and murder me.,rapeandmurderthrowaw,88,9,89,http://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/11g8uo/went_to_get_a_drink_acquaintance_threatened_to/,"Sorry folks, I don't know where to post this or what I want from you. It's 1 AM, I'm freaked out and I guess I want some feedback/support. 

So tonight was a friend of a friend's birthday (call him Bob). I happened to be at a show near the bar where they were celebrating. Got a text from from a friend (call him Eric) to come and get a drink and wish Bob a happy birthday. I agreed. I walked in, greeted Eric and told Bob happy birthday.

Then I was smothered against a large, muscular, unfamiliar torso. It's a friend of Eric and Bob's. We'll call him Kevin, but I didn't know who it was at the time (couldn't see; face was pressed into his torso). I return the hug at first, but it goes on longer than I'm comfortable with, so I started to pull away. Kevin holds tighter, and whispers in my ear, “Don't fight. If you fight me, I'll rape you. If you just let me hold you, I'll make love to you. But then I'll kill you, of course.”

Eric hears this, and tells Kevin he should let go. Kevin refuses. The “hug” goes on for a while longer, while Kevin asks if I'm turned on, and if I know how much blood is in a human body. Finally, Kevin lets go, and I scamper off to the bathroom to collect myself. I think, OK, I'm fucking leaving. I'm going back to the show (I had left at intermission to come here), and everything is going to be fine.

So I walk out, start toward the bar door, and someone fucking pushes me from behind. Not really hard, but enough to make me stumble. I turn around; of course it was fucking Kevin. At this point I almost run out to my car.

Eric, who's a sweet guy, followed me out. By the time I rolled down the window, I was crying. Eric apologized profusely for his friend, explaining that he's a good guy, he just says weird stuff. No, not because he's drunk. Just because he's Kevin. I've met Kevin once before tonight, and he apparently decided I was a “cool chick,” which to him means that I won't get upset if he threatens to rape and murder me, and then pushes me around just because he can.

Eric kept apologizing, but seemed to think “he didn't really mean those things” was an adequate explanation. He also registered that I was upset, like girls get sometimes, I guess, but didn't make the connection as to why and was even a little perturbed that I reacted the way I did (I'm normally pretty thick-skinned. I mean, I hang out on Reddit, after all).

So... why the FUCK would anyone think that was OK? And even if it was a joke (a horrifically distasteful one), how the FUCK is it OK to push someone half your size and make her feel powerless and scared?",,False,,t5_2qr7i,False,,,True,t3_11g8uo,http://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/11g8uo/went_to_get_a_drink_acquaintance_threatened_to/,

Someone on your Fb book posts a picture saying ""if you think this is okay in restaurants"" &lt;insert picture of a woman holding a mug of beer while wearing a ridiculously short plaid miniskirt and a button up white shirt that appears two sizes too small, tied up in a knot so as to expose her entire midriff...at least far enough up to cover the band of her matching plaid bra with the cups (of course) left exposed with her breasts practically spilling out into plain view&gt;... In the next pane is a woman in a park breast-feeding her newborn- ironically showing LESS breast than the former woman and accompanied with the caption ""then this shouldn't phase you either""...

I think the fact that breast feeding is considered 'inappropriate' and women who are 2/3s naked is not only acceptable but practically encouraged by many, says a lot about our culture and just how little progress we've actually made...

I think it's a perfect illustration on how men think they own women's bodies ( and how many women also seem to accept that concept as well, as they too support legislation to ban breast-feeding as 'indecent exposer') . Men think they get to dictate our sexuality- our bodies and how we use them... A woman bearing all to gratify a man sexually is exactly what breasts are for, right? We are theirs- breasts and all, to please men. We and our breasts are objects, owned objects...

A woman choosing to expose parts of herself for practical purposes is the object of scorn or shame because she's not doing it to please men... She's not doing her job. She's went rouge. She's forgot her place in life. She's forgot her low stature on the totem pole of society. ""How dare she! What nerve!! We need to enact legislation to prevent this sort of flagrant abandonment of social parodical before women start to empower themselves and actively participate as the wielders of social/political power. We (men, usually white) are the only ones capable of deciding, nay, only ones with the RIGHT to decide how women use their bodies.""

It drives me crazy that some women seem to agree with this subconscious form of reasoning that states our bodies are property and therefore support these men who seek to do just that. Those women who think a woman should go to a private space- the bathroom stall, if need be, in order to do that most natural of act... rarely do you see those women picketing outside of strip clubs or protesting against lingerie clad  mannequin in the display window of Victory Secrets.

The problem is the toxic masculinity of today. There is this culture of treating women as the ""other"". Women are simply human beings, there's no reason to get nervous or lack confidence simply by talking to them, any more than talking to humans in general.

&gt;If you approach a woman as a man with no confidence you'll look really creepy which is shameful which is isolating.

It's little to do with ""no confidence"". It's about being able to communicate with other genders in a healthy way. There is this idea of ""every woman is a potential mate"" that is an unspoken rule for male culture today. This is expressed when you look at the whole ""can men and women ever be just friends"" debacle. If a man simply treats a woman as a human being, and recounts this with his peers, they're all going to ask him if they have sex. There's constant peer pressure in that way.

&gt;Women never get their self esteem so battered down that they can't have sex. 

That's actually untrue. A lot of women have self esteem issues that interfere with their sex life. This sort of short-sightedness is called the invisibility of normal women. When you're constantly battered by photoshopped ideal ""women"" in media, your idea of a normal woman is warped to the extent that the ""archetype"" of women in your mind is not representative of the actual thing. Let me put it this way. Imagine a dog in your head. What color was it, how big was it, what was it doing? For me, I think of a dog with short brown fur, about 1.5 meters from nose to tail, and it was looking at me with its tongue hanging out. Was it the same for you? Even though there are all sorts of different types of dogs, and there is no plain old ""dog"" in real life, we have an idea of a ""dog"" standard archetype in our mind. Now, try to think of a woman. What do you see? Is that representative of most women in your life? Think about that for a second. Women come in all shapes and sizes and ages. So why does that particular archetype of woman dwell in your mind?

Now, realize that women see these women in media too. They don't see the untouched photos of these models, or without makeup. Are they even wearing makeup, or is it photoshop? The reality of women becomes blurred with the imaginary. [Here](http://static.thehollywoodgossip.com/images/gallery/katy-perry-with-no-makeup_520x349.jpg) is Katy Perry without any blatant makeup (I'd say she's wearing concealer, but again there's no way to know for sure from just a picture). Now [here](http://www.billboard.com/photos/stylus/502563-katy-perry-salute-617-409.jpg) is a picture of her, without obvious make up. Of these two, which one is closer to the woman archetype in your mind when I asked you to imagine a woman in your head?

This is how the uncertainty creep comes in for women. Is she wearing makeup or does she just naturally look like that? Are her breasts really that big or is it a wonderbra? Is her body really shaped like that or is she wearing [shapewear](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=pCG&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;q=shapewear+clothes&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=894&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=_50sUL_HBYq1ygGtuYF4) underneath?

That's why taking off clothes for sex can become a very uncomfortable experience for a woman who's not comfortable with presenting her ""real"" body to someone.

&gt;How do feminists want men to be? (BE SPECIFIC)

The idea behind feminism is gender deconstruction. So how a feminist would want man to be is basically to stop feeling that you're under pressure from other men (or women) to act a certain way.

Specifically, don't get your gender interaction cues from movies, where some guys just can't speak coherently because ""OMG SHE IS SO GORGEOUS"". That's not reality. That's an exaggeration, like in those cartoons where the guy turns into a wolf and goes wild. That was supposed to be a joke, but now it's turned into a trope as to how men are supposed to act in front of women.

The important thing to do is to train yourself to look at a person as human first, gender second. Being constantly reminded of gender is not fun (this is similar to a person of color being constantly reminded of their color, or a foreigner being reminded of being a foreigner).

The most important thing is *you don't need to have every single one of your interactions with women revolve around how you feel towards them from physical urges*. Get that out of your head. Try that some time you're out in public. Let's say you're at the grocery store or whatever and the cashier is a woman. Try to imagine how much different your interaction would be if it was a man instead. Would it be different? Why?

This is not to say that you should treat women the way you do men. The idea is to take the *good*, *healthy* aspects of how you treat men, and the *good*, *healthy*, aspects of how you treat women, and combine them into a single technique that includes both genders.

Now, with all that said, there is nothing wrong with being romantic. But, to borrow from political discourse, it's important to limit it based on time, place, and manner.

I agree with affirmative consent, but there has to be some leeway given for the realities of real life sexual encounters. It's not unreasonable to assume that someone who is aggressively kissing you and grinding on you consents to some over the clothes touching. Over the clothes touching is generally a feature of making out with someone. It's part of the cultural script of making out. So long as you stop when asked to stop, then I don't think you've really done anything wrong. 

Is it really reasonable to expect someone to stop and ask before each and every little touch? Regardless of the circumstances or what the two of them were already doing?  The school's policy is kind of weird. Each seperate touch is considered a seperate sex act. Each of which requires its own seperate consent.

*Brides are increasingly shunning traditions surrounding weddings

*Choosing not to have engagement rings or wear white on the day

*Almost a quarter plan to keep their maiden name after marriage

*19% agree aspects of traditional weddings are 'anti-feminist'

*But 76% still want to be walked down the aisle by their father

The image of a veiled bride walking down the aisle on her father's arm could become a thing of the past as a growing trend for 'feminist weddings' has been detected among modern brides to be.

Doing away with the engagement ring, choosing not to be 'given away like property' and wearing a colour other than white are key themes gaining traction in the feminist wedding trend.

The findings, revealed in a survey of 200 brides to be, revealed that almost a quarter of women planned on keeping their maiden name after marriage, while one in 10 were planning to wear a colour other than white on their wedding day.

Traditions such as the wearing of an engagement ring are also increasingly being rejected by brides who feel it is anti-feminist - with such an obvious token to be worn on the finger marking the woman in question as 'taken'.

The tradition of wearing a veil is being similarly rejected, as some women believe it plays into the idea that a woman is 'revealed' to her husband as the virgin bride (though actually the use of a veil is steeped in history and has very different significance across multiple cultures).

However, while there is undoubtedly a stirring among young brides to be, parents can take comfort in the fact that while some women are beginning to push back against the patriarchy, the majority are still keen to uphold certain traditions, with 76 per cent of brides saying they really would like their father to walk them down the aisle.

Elki Parmar of Wedding Days.co.uk, who conducted the survey, said: ‘Some of the brides we have spoken to are doing things that they feel make their wedding more 'feminist'.

'That could be reflected by deciding not be given away, the idea being that one of the connotations of this tradition is that the woman is property to be given away.
Brides are choosing to do away with many wedding traditions such as engagement rings

‘Other brides are choosing not to wear white on their wedding day as a woman’s white wedding dress traditionally carries connotations of virginal innocence whereas what the groom wears on his wedding day is not perceived to be symbolic, creating somewhat of an imbalance from some feminist perspectives.'

Elki said: ‘Many of the women we spoke to thought that changing their last name after marriage to their husband's conformed to a patriarchal ideology and didn’t want to feel they were giving up their own identity for their husbands

'While some were planning to not change their names at all, others were going to incorporate their husband's name into their own.

'However, many women also echoed the sentiment that a couple sharing the same last name is something that binds their family together.

Kelly Doncaster, Wedding Manager at Leicester wedding venue, The City Rooms, said: “'It is true that couples like to make their wedding their own and often do away with certain traditions.

‘For many, traditions are still part of the ceremony but not because of reasons which may be perceived as anti-feminist.

'For example the bride will often want her father to ‘give’ her away, not because of anti-feminist reasons but because she loves her father and wants to display that love on her wedding day.",,False,,t5_2qr7i,False,,,True,t3_1j808a,http://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/1j808a/rise_of_the_feminist_wedding_no_veils_no/,

I am a girl. Girls throughout the school do not have the right to wear trousers. This is a particularly pertinent issue from the ages of 16-18. At this age, boys in the school are allowed to choose their own suit of grey, dark blue or black, with appropriate jumper and shirt. Girls have to have their own uniform supplied by the school. There has never been a discussion on this. This is compulsory and we feel, discrimatory. 
We set up a closed forum on Facebook to discuss the matter, proposing that girls should be given the same choice as the boys. We clearly stated that we were neither anit-uniform nor anti-regulation of uniform. It quickly became a site for the ridicule of those passionate about the issue. Between the relevant comments were jokes about rape and domestic violence, one example being ""it is easier to penetrate girls if they are wearing skirts or tights"". We have now closed the forum. 
The only positive out of this is now the whole school is talking about it. Both girls and boys feel threatened by a potential change. We are leaving the school in two weeks - this is not for personal gain or retribution towards our school. We are genuine believers in equality of men and women and hope to make some ground in improving equality in our school. 
How do we turn this around, get people on board, and make sure equality is taken seriously?







UPDATE:
Sorry I've been terribly busy with exams! We had a meeting with the senior administration a week ago: our headteacher was immediately defensive then seemed to come around to the idea. His original argument was that girls aged 16-18 are permitted to wear a small amount of makeup, and boys cannot. He said if we truly believed in equality, we would go without makeup at school. We rebuffed this, saying that the makeup right should be extended to boys and girls. He moved on.
Another member of the senior administration talked about how girls were more likely to abuse the uniform rules. I personally rebuffed this - this is a personality trait, not a gender trait, and was stereotypical and dismissive.
Ultimately, we got across that their policy was discriminatory. Apparently, nothing can be done, since they have ""an existing deal with the uniform supplier"". However, they are going to look into it over the coming months. Although we are leaving, I will maintain connections with the school (due to younger siblings), and am happy to keep the cause going. We have passed the movement on to a small number of girls in the year below us. Hopefully something will get done - this may not seem like progress to many of you, yet our school's administration is notoriously uncooperative. We left the meeting knowing that a formal complaint had been held, so the next time a group of young people decide to address the issue, there will be a previous record of its discriminatory nature. We also described the extent of the abuse we received, and the school will be starting an increased Personal, Social, Health Education program throughout the school from September, with a larger focus on the issue of sexism.

""Saying someone is dressed a certain way because they want to be ""bothered"" promotes rape culture in our society. There have been many times when a girl gets raped and the accused says ""Well, if she didn't want to be raped why is she dressed like that? She obviously wanted it"". Situations like this don't only apply to rape, but ANY unwanted attention such as cat-calling, heckling, whistling, and touching.
This kind of thinking should not be promoted or tolerated and it sickens me that people see this kind of behaviour as okay, or even funny. Everyone needs to know that the victimization of women is no laughing matter and should be taken seriously.""

I know it's not perfect, but what's said is said.


In the comments of the post I was attacked by people of both genders for being whiny, hypersensitive and was frequently called asinine.


Once again, I know that what I said wasn't perfect and that situations like that apply to both genders, but I just don't want to be called crazy.. Things like this are really important to me and this situation has definitely made me think twice about voicing my opinion again. 

Does anyone have any advice for situations like this?

If so, does it ever bother you?**

I was part of a thread that had some pretty disgusting images in it (maggots in teeth, etc.). In response, a few people linked that popular website ""eyebleach"", a website that shows pictures of hot women to try and distract you from whatever you just looked at.

I pointed out some things about this website which I find curious:

1. It's designed to encourage (or take advantage of the existing) use of images of women as a disposable commodity

1. It strangely introduces gender into the genderless phenomenon of feeling shocked, grossed out, or disgusted (compare to the concept of the kitten/unicorn chaser)

1. It metaphorically compares women to a household cleaning product

All salient points, I hoped. I tried to make it clear that I wasn't outright attacking the site, and ended by saying these were just some things to think about.

I may as well have said ""downvote me please"". The only two respondents were people who brought up ""guy bleach"" (the ""male version""). No arguments or reasoning as to why that would be relevant, of course.

I'm being a bit hyperbolic here. My comment was not that important or noticed, nor was it downvoted into extreme oblivion. Also, people can downvote for any reason -- perhaps, for example, they didn't want the thread to derail into a political discussion. Also, who cares about comments on reddit?

It's just that it wouldn't be out of line with my prior experience with redditor anger at even the slightest hint of feminist thought. I notice a consistent uncanny reflex to ""shut it down"". For instance, the ""guy bleach"" responses I received: they were not intent on continuing the conversation, but ending it (spectacularly). What the fuck? At least *think* about the possibility that this could be a valid criticism, for one second? Has anyone else ever felt this frustration on reddit?

As to the cause, I would guess that it's the same old story. People hate being wrong. They don't want to admit that they could have done something harmful when they never intended to. Sometimes, they react in the most immature way possible, by throwing a tantrum and calling it an argument. I figure all this because I'm guilty of it myself. It just gets tiring, the endless punditry in lieu of dialogue.

The person who made the ridiculous request for the knitter to stop was clearly identified as male, the children's father. However as I was reading through the comments I noticed that most people were referring to the parent as female/the children's mother and saying all sorts of nasty things about her being a whore/cunt.

Growing up, I expressed my natural affection for girls as friendship. When I got to the age where I began to feel that it was no longer enough to remain shyly companionate, my ability to connect with girls-as-friends began wearing down. 

Other guys and movies and music are always setting romantic success as a key part of male identity. I've tried to cultivate platonic friendships with girls, but over time, the ""friend zone"" diatribe has left me questioning whether or not I'm just allowing myself to be relegated into an inferior role. Because sex and ""collecting"" women have displaced the value of these friendships as criteria for my own self-esteem, I find myself either entirely disinterested in girls who I'm not attracted to or interested and resentful of friends (resenting the damage done to my masculine self-image moreso than the natural resentment caused by unrequited feelings).

Most of the guys in my life consider girls in this same light. Whenever I'm not making a conscious effort to treat women as people who walk around and think thoughts similar to my own, with their own interests and capabilities, etc., I slip back into it, too. And, in a broader sense, the focus other people project conditions a lot of girls into these stereotype-confirming unidimensional beings: sexy, attention-grabbing, but generally uninteresting (to me, not to your average fratstar etc.), skilless, lifeless. It's really frustrating, because the element of femininity that seems to be suppressed is the part that I've always wanted to experience in another, full person. It's what that shyly companionate boy was cautiously stepping towards before the world stepped in.

Abstract:


A number of journalists and scholars have pointed to the sexual objectification of women and men in popular media to argue that Western culture has become ‘‘sexualized’’ or even ‘‘pornified.’’ Yet it is not clear whether men or women have become more frequently—or more intensely sexualized—over time. In a longitudinal content analysis of images of women and men on more than four decades of Rolling Stone magazine covers (1967–2009), we begin to answer such questions. Using a unique analytical framework that allows us to measure both the frequency and intensity of sexualization, we find that sexualized images of men and women have increased, though women continue to be more frequently sexualized than men. Yet our most striking finding is the change in how women—but not men—are sexualized. Women are increasingly likely to be ‘‘hypersexualized,’’ but men are not. These findings not only document changes in the sexualization of men and women in popular culture over time, they also point to a narrowing of the culturally acceptable ways for ‘‘doing’’ femininity as presented in popular media.

It seems like a major (though by no means the only!) issue for MRAs is the imbalance in custody law, by which mothers are kind of automatically assumed to be the better parent.  

I think that this is one of those cases where the interests of both MRAs and feminists concur.  It occurred to me that this situation is not only contrary to men's rights, but is actually anti-feminist, as well.  

A major concern of contemporary feminism is the issue of ""essentialism,"" i.e. the phenomenon of identifying certain traits as *essential* characteristics of femininity.  (Same issue, mutatis mutandis, with masculinity.)  

In the case of custody law, the tendency to award children to women reflexively seems like a kind of essentialism codified into law.  On the one hand, it construes characteristics like ""nurturing"" as essential parts of what it means to be a woman.  ""Well, give the kid to the mother, she's obviously going to be more nurturing.""  

On the other hand, it seems like there is an equally pernicious bit of essentilalizing about men going on, too.  ""Don't give the kid to the dad, he'll be more emotionally distant and he can take it.""  (Or whatever.)

I'm not saying that suddenly feminists and MRAs are going to hold hands and sing Kumbaya.  There are certainly plenty of real and significant opposition between the two camps.  But it seems like this is a case of men being denied rights by a phenomenon of concern to feminists, as well.

What should I do?,enigmamachine23,76,18,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/18cn18/my_work_wont_hire_women_what_should_i_do/,"For all intents and purposes, please consider this a work of fiction. I am only speaking hypothetically at the moment. Originally I posted this to /r/advice but I feel that I will get better advice here.

I'm a guy. I don't necessarily consider myself a feminist by name, but I strongly agree with egalitarian ideas . I work at a small business. We deal with internet shipping and are connected to a retail store, but that's about as far as I will go into detail about what we do. There is a woman who is a regular customer at the retail store and I have become close friends with her over the years, having met her at the retail store. This is not a romantic relationship on any level.

The other day my boss (the owner of the company) made a comment effectively saying that he was not interested in hiring anyone under the age of 30 and was not interested in hiring women. Our humor is pretty blue around here (being a warehouse full of dudes) so I sorta let it pass (begrudgingly) as just a stupid joke, as we have had three female employees in the past. 

Today my friend, the one I mentioned before, mentioned that she was looking for a job. We have been actively seeking two new (entry level) employees and there are very few qualifications, but she far exceeds any qualifications and has a decent knowledge of our product. My boss knew her from the retail store and knew that she had the qualifications/good character plus she is educated. Effectively, she is a perfect candidate for this job. I passed on her information and my boss effectively told me ""I'm not interested in hiring women."" and that the jobs were already filled (which I highly doubt). Turns out, this was no joke.

I'd like to add that I value my friendship with this person a great deal more than I value my job. I told her at face value what he said. I have logs to prove it. What is the next step? Could I lose my job over this?

The biggest reason I'm asking this is because I'm getting really tired of reading an important article/argument for men's rights, support it 100% as a woman, then looking to comment and seeing misogynistic comments for pages and pages. It's depressing and overall it creates a horribly skewed view of a true Feminist's standpoints. Often, when I finish reading the comments from /r/mensrights I start to think ""Great. All the men hate me because they believe I'm a woman and therefore an idiot, a bigot, and that I don't give a flying fuck about men's rights.""

Furthermore, pretty much every /r/feminism post I read isn't full of male-hating, assuming females. If someone generalizes, the most upvoted comments are calling out those generalizations.

For those of you who don't know, the Bechdel Test is a test developed by a woman named Alison Bechdel. It is a simple test that measures patriarchy in films by requiring that they have three components to pass: (1) it has to have at least two women in it, who (2) who talk to each other, about (3) something besides a man. Some critics require all of the female characters to be named, so I will add that information as well. 

Applying this test to the Best Picture nominations is a great way to measure the progressiveness of the most acclaimed films in today's media, and a good way to see what views are prevailing as we head into the future. This is NOT to say that any of the failing films are not good films. Some of my favorite films ever do not pass this test, and some don't even have female characters in them.

1. Zero Dark Thirty - passes with flying colors. Not surprising since this film was directed, produced and starred a woman.
2. Argo - passes.
3. Beasts of the Southern Wild - passes.
4. Lincoln - passes.
5. Amour - passes, but the only scene that ensures it's pass is a scene between the main character and her nurse, who is not a named character.
6. Les Miserables - passes although none of the women that Fantine speaks with are named and this is the only interaction between women in the film.
7. Life of Pi - fails 2 out of three.
8. Django Unchained - fails 2 out of three.
9. Silver Linings Playbook - fails one out of the three, two women do talk to each other, but it is always about Bradley Cooper's character.

**Liberal feminism**:

- primarily focuses on women’s ability to show and maintain their equality through their own actions and choices. 

- argues that our society holds the false belief that women are, by nature, less intellectually and physically capable than men, it tends to discriminate against women in the academy, the forum, and the marketplace. Liberal feminists believe that “female subordination is rooted in a set of customary and legal constraints that blocks women’s entrance to and success in the so-called public world” and they work hard to emphasize the equality of men and women through political and legal reform

Terms:

- procedural accounts of personal autonomy: in order for women to enjoy personal autonomy, they should have a broad range of autonomy-enabling conditions, such as: being free of violence and the threat of violence, being free of the limits set by paternalistic and moralistic laws, having access to options

**Ecofeminism**

 - connects the exploitation and domination of women with that of the environment; ecofeminism argues that there is a connection between women and nature that comes from their shared history of oppression by a patriarchal Western society.

Terms:

- deep ecology: the philosophy that environmental problems stem from a human-centered ideological position. 
They can only be solved when the needs of nature are put first or on the same level as human needs.

- biocentrism and ecocentrism: The act of putting nature's needs first or alongside human needs.
Recommended authors: Françoise d'Eaubonne, Vandana Shiva, Maria Mies

**Transfeminism**

- a category of feminism, most often known for the application of transgender discourses to feminist discourses, and of feminist beliefs to transgender discourse"".

- often criticizes the ideas of a universal sisterhood - instead, transfeminists view gender as a multifaceted set of diverse intrinsic and social qualities. For example, there are trans/cis men/women who express themselves in an unusually feminine or masculine way. Because this strongly affects how the person experiences their gender, and also their standing within patriarchy, transfeminists would argue that masculine/feminine expression is an important concept worthy of feminist inquiry, to be compared and contrasted with both birth sex and gender identity.


**Anarcha-feminism**

- views patriarchy as a manifestation of involuntary coercive hierarchy that should be replaced by decentralized voluntary association. Anarcha-feminists believe that the struggle against patriarchy is an essential part of class struggle, and the anarchist struggle against the state. In essence, the philosophy sees anarchist struggle as a necessary component of feminist struggle and vice-versa.

- an important aspect is its opposition to traditional concepts of family, education and gender roles; the institution of marriage is one of the most widely opposed.

Terms:

 - free love: a social movement that rejects marriage, which is seen as a form of social bondage. Its initial goal was to separate the state from sexual matters such as marriage, birth control, and adultery. It claimed that such issues were the concern of the people involved, and no one else

**Black feminism**

- argues that sexism, class oppression, and racism are inextricably bound together. The way these relate to each other is called intersectionality. Forms of feminism that strive to overcome sexism and class oppression but ignore race can discriminate against many people, including women, through racial bias. Black feminist theory has argued that black women are positioned with in structures of power in fundamentally different ways than white women. Black feminist organizations emerged during the 1970s and face many difficulties from both the white feminist and black nationalist political organizations they were confronting. These women fought against suppression from the larger movements in which many of its members came from.

Terms:

- intersectionality: examining how various biological, social and cultural categories such as gender, race, class, ability, sexual orientation, and other axes of identity interact on multiple and often simultaneous levels, contributing to systematic social inequality. Intersectionality holds that the classical conceptualizations of oppression within society, such as racism, sexism, homophobia, and religion-based bigotry, do not act independently of one another; instead, these forms of oppression interrelate, creating a system of oppression that reflects the ""intersection"" of multiple forms of discrimination. 

- matrix of domination: a sociological paradigm that explains issues of oppression that deal with race, class, and gender, which, though recognized as different social classifications, are all interconnected. As an example: many argue that Colin Powell’s success (as one Black man out of millions) is proof that discrimination based on race has been, or is close to being, eradicated in the United States – however, proponents of the theory of the matrix of domination would argue that this overlooks issues of social class, gender, and age, Powell being an upper class, middle-aged/elderly male.

**Postcolonial feminism**

-  through analysis of entrenched power structures in formerly colonized nations, postcolonial feminism explains how economic and political institutions and social practices in those nations often oppress and marginalize women. In addition, it demonstrates how women around the globe struggle for equality and independence for themselves, their families, and their nations.

- often referred to as Third World feminism centers around the idea that racism, colonialism, and the long lasting effects (economic, political, and cultural) of colonialism in the postcolonial setting, are inextricably bound up with the unique gendered realities of non-white,and non-Western women. Postcolonial feminists criticize Western feminists because they have a history of universalizing women's issues, and their discourses are often misunderstood to represent women globally.

- thus, one of the central ideas in postcolonial feminism is that by using the term 'woman' as a universal group, they are then only defined by their gender and not by social classes and ethnic identities. Also, it is believed by postcolonial feminists that mainstream Western feminists ignored the voices of non-white, non-western women for many years, thus creating resentment from feminists in developing nations.

- postcolonial feminists have had strong ties with black feminists because colonialism usually contains themes of racism. Both groups have struggled for recognition, not only by men in their own culture, but also by Western feminists.

**Multiracial feminism**

- refers to the activist and scholarly work conducted by women of color and anti-racist white allies to promote race, class, and gender equality. In comparison to the highly documented second-wave white, middle-class feminism, which centered on abolishing patriarchy and privileged patriarchy as an oppression over all others, women of color feminism resists separating oppression and insists on recognizing the intersectionality of race, class, and gender oppression. 

**Radical feminism**

- focuses on the theory of patriarchy as a system of power that organizes society into a complex of relationships based on the assertion that male supremacy oppresses women. Radical feminism aims to challenge and overthrow patriarchy by opposing standard gender roles and oppression of women and calls for a radical reordering of society.

- locates the root cause of women's oppression in patriarchal gender relations, as opposed to legal systems (as in liberal feminism) or class conflict (as in socialist feminism and Marxist feminism)

**Socialist feminism** 

- argues that liberation can only be achieved by working to end both the economic and cultural sources of women's oppression. 

- broadens Marxist feminism's argument for the role of capitalism in the oppression of women  (and rejects the idea that class and class struggle are the only defining elements of history and economic development) and radical feminism's theory of the role of gender and the patriarchy. 

- reject radical feminism’s main claim that patriarchy the only or primary source of oppression of women and assert that women are unable to be free due to their financial dependence on males in society. Women are subjects to the male rulers in capitalism due to an uneven balance in wealth. They see economic dependence as the driving force of women’s subjugation to men. Further, socialist feminists see women’s liberation as a necessary part of larger quest for social, economic and political justice.

**Postmodern feminism**

-  incorporates postmodern and post-structuralist theory, and thus sees itself as moving beyond the modernist polarities of liberal feminism and radical feminism

- has been described as the ultimate acceptor of diversity: “multiple truths, multiple roles, multiple realities are part of its focus. There is a rejectance of an essential nature of women, of one-way to be a woman. Poststructural feminism offers a useful philosophy for diversity in feminism because of its acceptance of multiple truths and rejection of essentialism”

Judith Butler on Gender performativity:

- sees gender as an act that has been rehearsed, much like a script, and we, as the actors make the script a reality through repetition, thus coming to perform in the mode of belief. 

- the distinction between the personal and the political or between private and public is itself a fiction designed to support an oppressive status quo: our most personal acts are, in fact, continually being scripted by hegemonic social conventions and ideologies” 

- sees gender not as an expression of what one is, rather as something that one does. Furthermore, she sees it not as a social imposition on a gender neutral body, but rather as a mode of ""self-making"" through which subjects become socially intelligible. According to Butler’s theory, homosexuality and heterosexuality are not fixed categories. A person is merely in a condition of “doing straightness” or “doing queerness”

**Marxist feminism**

- focuses on the social institutions of private property and capitalism to explain and criticize gender inequality and oppression. 

- posits that private property gives rise to economic inequality, dependence, political and domestic struggle between the sexes, and is the root of women's oppression in the current social context.

**Chicana feminism**

- analyzes the historical, social, political, and economic roles of Mexican American, Chicana, and Hispanic women in the United States

**Libertarian feminism**

-  attempts to change legal systems in order to eliminate class privileges and gender privileges and to ensure that individuals have equal rights, including an equal claim under the law to their own persons and property. Individualist feminism encourages women to take full responsibility for their own lives. It also opposes any government interference into the choices adults make with their own bodies because, it contends, such interference creates a coercive hierarchy (such as patriarchy)

**Post-structural feminism**

- emphasizes ""the contingent and discursive nature of all identities"",[1] and in particular the social construction of gendered subjectivities

- resists universalist or normalizing conceptions of women as a group or altogether dismiss the category “woman”. They share with psychoanalytic feminists a skepticism about phallogocentric language and social structures, as well as the French feminist rejection of metanarrative explanations and prescriptive norms for gender and sexuality. 

**French feminism**

- is distinguished by an approach which is more philosophical and literary. Its writings tend to be effusive and metaphorical being less concerned with political doctrine and generally focused on theories of ""the body"". The term includes writers who are not French, but who have worked substantially in France and the French tradition.

- Simone de Beauvoir’s analysis focuses on the social construction of Woman as the Other, this de Beauvoir identifies as fundamental to women's oppression. She argues that women have historically been considered deviant and abnormal, and contends that even Mary Wollstonecraft considered men to be the ideal toward which women should aspire. De Beauvoir argues that for feminism to move forward, this attitude must be set aside.

**Transnational feminism**

- attentive to intersections among nationhood, race, gender, sexuality and economic exploitation on a world scale, in the context of emergent global capitalism.

- inquires in to the social, political and economic conditions comprising imperialism; their connections to colonialism and nationalism; the role of gender, the state, race, class, and sexuality in the organization of resistance to hegemonies in the making and unmaking of nation and nation-state.

- transnational feminist practice is attentive to feminism as both a liberatory formation and one with longstanding ties to colonialism, racism and imperialism. As such, it resists utopic ideas about ""global sisterhood"" while simultaneously working to lay the groundwork for more productive and equitable social relations among women across borders and cultural contexts.

**Atheist Feminism**

- is a movement that advocates the Feminism within atheism. Atheist feminists also oppose religion as a main source of female oppression and inequality, believing that the majority of the religions are sexist and oppressive to women.

**Feminist Theology**

- is a movement found in several religions, including Buddhism, Christianity, Judaism, and New Thought, to reconsider the traditions, practices, scriptures, and theologies of those religions from a feminist perspective. Some of the goals of feminist theology include increasing the role of women among the clergy and religious authorities, reinterpreting male-dominated imagery and language about God, determining women's place in relation to career and motherhood, and studying images of women in the religion's sacred texts.

Skepchick wrote [a blog post](http://skepchick.org/2011/12/reddit-makes-me-hate-atheists/) about the fairly significant number of Redditors with the tendency to objectify nearly every woman they see pictured on this site. Feministe posted [a similar article](http://www.feministe.us/blog/archives/2012/01/04/why-yes-but-is-the-wrong-response-to-misogyny/) a few days later. Today, I noticed the trend again with [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/o9vhd/my_handsewn_super_meat_boy_and_myself_as_bandage/).

(Only one more link, I promise.)

Now, obviously, a woman who happens to take a picture of herself and post it on a forum is not 'asking' for anything. She doesn't 'deserve' to be treated like a sex object. However, I'm noticing a trend that, now that I think about it, has existed for a long time, but I have not seen named before. Consider [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/o9vhd/my_handsewn_super_meat_boy_and_myself_as_bandage/c3fkcq6), which I have also quoted below:

&gt; It works both ways; let's be honest here. The main subject of the picture is definitely her, it looks like Super Meat Boy was almost an afterthought. I would be very surprised if the look on her face, the high angle shot, the way the doll is pushed up just under her midsection and the perfect tilt of her head were accidental and she just happened to get the perfect picture in one shot.
&gt;
&gt; Calling her an ugly attention whore and whatever else people are saying as a way of lashing out is annoying and stupid, but you don't post this kind of shit to reddit in a vacuum. You don't post a picture that looks like this to a subreddit populated by young, lonely, angsty dudes on accident or without knowing what you're doing.

Usually when a man objectifies a woman and the woman or a third party criticizes him, he defends himself by saying that 'she was asking for it' or that 'she knew what she was doing'. This defense isn't new; men have justified sexual assault for years by claiming that the woman's dress demonstrated 'what she really wanted'. But the defense is interesting because it assigns the woman agency. Yes, it construes her as a participant in her own objectification, but it also highlights the fact that she is or could be a participant at all. It would seem that female agency in these types of situations in so threatening to the objectifying male gaze that the man behind the gaze has to twist her agency towards his own ends. I find this defense startling. It essentially argues that women are too intelligent or self-aware to be objectified.

1338886606.0,53,self.Feminism,ultof,I shouldn't have to like or support SRS in order to consider myself a feminist.,PoseidonsDick,102,49,185,http://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/ultof/i_shouldnt_have_to_like_or_support_srs_in_order/,"I have considered myself a feminist ever since I learned what the word meant when I was a kid. I liked the idea of women gaining equality and wanted to be paid as much as men did, even at a young age. As I grew up, being a woman had noticeable impacts on my career; a good example of that is that I was a career debater, and took several losses to equally-talented men. When I solicited advice from spectators, many of them expressed sentiments that I should have won the round. I was told that men are often more engaging public speakers and people are more likely to trust the voices of men over that of women.

My point by telling you this is that I supported equality for women before Reddit and before SRS. I want to ensure that myself and my daughters have a fair shot at life. I want to continue volunteering for organizations that benefit women of various ages. I want to continue working with indigenous women who face higher instances of almost every kind of violence, which is something I have been doing for years. I want to continue teaching debate to other young women to help empower them like I was when I was their age.

When I first started paying attention to the goings-on at SRS, I found it mildly annoying the way threads were invaded but didn't pay much mind. For the most part, I supported the SRS ""side"" between them and MRAs during the many discussions of whether or not women are oppressed *rolls eyes*. Ultimately, I never considered joining because something about the attacks they lead against people bothered me internally. Maybe it's my innate sense to avoid personal attacks, as SRS does tend to get very personal, at least from my perspective. However, my personal approach to arguing with people I find bigoted, disrespectful or otherwise wrong is to try and see it from their shoes, find a common ground, point out logical fallacies, and otherwise do everything I can to have a *mature, rational, calm discussion* with the person. Being ripped to shreds has never convinced anyone of anything. Taking the time to calmly educate someone HAS changed minds. I know this because I've witnessed it, lived it and participated in it. That has never been SRS's approach to arguing, and I think **it is completely valid to oppose that approach and lack respect for an organization that encourages merciless attacks as a means of responding to bigotry**.

We are all here because we are feminists, or because we want to be educated by feminists. Reading the recent post where someone expressed dislike for SRS, I felt slightly ill seeing that anyone who said anything remotely negative about SRS was downvoted into oblivion, **even if that person was contributing to discussion**. Why can't I say that I'm a feminist without supporting SRS? I think that's wrong, and it violates the standards of this community because people with valid viewpoints that they share with others shouldn't be downvoted. **Why is a community that ought to be actively supporting rights for women marginalizing people who, outside of some insignificant internet community, live their lives working to ensure that women receive equality to the best of their ability?**

Eventually, I was banned by SRS, just to provide readers with full disclosure. I'm sure some upset person will comb my history to find the exact context for you, but from what I remember: A user I responded to had made a comment along the lines of, ""You fucking ladies don't know how hard men have it..."" Etc. I posted agreeing that we shouldn't dispute the problems men face in an attempt to find a common ground with OP while disagreeing with his statement. My quote was taken out of context as being a ""But what about the menz"" type quote. I was banned when I attempted to point out the context of what I said lying in the first commenter's comment. I stand by what I said that got SRS's attention and don't see it as adverse to feminism. Not that I think that agreeing that men face difficult issues, too, somehow makes me not a feminist. **This ideology is about equality.**

Ultimately, I understand if my opposition to SRS makes me unwelcome here, though I dispute it heavily. I see no value in deterring people who work hard for women's rights just because some internet community doesn't accept them into their club. It doesn't seem to me downvoting or not accepting people into /r/feminism who don't agree with SRS really prioritizes feminism. I was sorry to see many of my sisters and brothers who commented relevant to the topic about how they also don't agree with various facets of SRS having their opinions eliminated from mainstream discussion. I don't agree with that at all. We should be working together to achieve equality for women.

I have no idea how this post will be received, but if anyone knows of a community where all feminists are welcome, rather than those who agree to support a vitriolic club as a condition for membership, I'm interested.

________________________________________________________

Edit: So, what am I supposed to get out of this? SRS isn't a downvote brigade, ok, fine. Clearly SRSMeta is, though, given being linked, and the users that had no interest in this thread days ago when it was posted prior to being linked. What is, exactly, the difference between those two subreddits, anyway?

Thanks everyone for bringing your opinions to the table. I feel a little better, since it does seem that most of the active /r/feminism users are ambivalent regarding people's stance with SRS. That's all I felt I needed to get across. I know now that people in my situation can be comfortable being on /r/feminism. To all others: I think there's plenty of evidence in this thread that not everyone here agrees with the beliefs and/or tactics of SRS, and we appreciate not being grouped in with them when related to the overall cause of feminism. Some of us want to approach bigotry from a calm discussion standpoint where people learn to walk in each other's shoes. And there are other approaches still.

I know that nearly all of my sexually active male friends with whom I've discussed the subject strongly prefer a significant other who is on the pill to using condoms.
