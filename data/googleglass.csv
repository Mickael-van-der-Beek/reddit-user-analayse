This Googler was wearing a current prototype and explaining some of the functionality. The Googler even let me try it on. It was amazing. 

It's difficult to describe but it gives the impression of a screen sitting a few feet in front of you. The display was very crisp and clear. It's quite unobtrusive when it's off but if you look up or tap it, it comes to life and all of a sudden you have a screen displayed in front of you. I was able give it a few commands (search, maps, translate) and it executed them almost perfectly (it gave the wrong search results one time but everything else worked great). It somehow manages to pack in all of the functionality that you would want from a smart phone and put it in front of you in a hands-free way but then get out of the way when you don't need it. 

What struck me more than anything else were people's reactions to it. By the time we were done a decent sized crowd had gathered around and were hanging on every word that the Googler said about Glass. This was a tech-savvy crowd but everyone could sense that they were witnessing something special. I've never seen people react to technology in this way before. It was a really cool experience.

I was fairly skeptical about Glass but having experienced it first hand, I think it has the potential to change the way we think about and interact with technology.",,False,self,t5_2tumi,False,,,True,t3_1csw2h,http://www.reddit.com/r/googleglass/comments/1csw2h/i_wore_google_glass_last_night_it_was_awesome/,

I can't believe I am writing this, because I thought a lot of the reviewers were professionals who do this for a living, but alas, here we are. I'm definitely not an expert, but I've gathered this much so far that a lot of reporters don't seem to be understanding:

- This is a beta product. Yes, it's a beta product you can talk about. The whole point is that new products like this can no longer launch without a suite of apps to go with it; this is the first time we have faced such a major development where this is absolutely true. An Appless Glass would not sell well. To develop good apps, you need designers, testers, and consumer opinions. This is why there is not an NDA. The final build, the app listing, and the possible features are not set in stone. **stop reviewing glass as an end-product, but rather a concept set to grow. Stop reporting on little pop vox stories of bars banning the product and random famous people hating on it. It's not a final product.**

- **The design isn't even set in stone.** Several times, there have been references to Warby Parker working with the people of Glass to try and give the product a different design. ([Link](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/21/technology/google-looks-to-make-its-computer-glasses-stylish.html)) Different ascetics would not change the value in giving out the Explorer's edition, because the point was to explore consumer possibilities.

- **The product will NOT be $1500 at ship. Stop asking yourself/your audience ""is it worth $1500?** No, it's not. It's a high cost to get an early product so you can develop apps and make money off it.

- **Tell us what apps you would like after using it extensively, not complain at the lack of apps.** Remember the era of fart and beer-filling apps for $.99 on the iPhone? Spare us that misery and give us ideas as to what you'd like to see. Developers have a lot of front-end time to make stuff. In the same vein, tell us what sort of Google Now cards would be awesome for Glass.",,False,self,t5_2tumi,False,,,True,t3_1et675,http://www.reddit.com/r/googleglass/comments/1et675/why_reading_glass_reviews_frustrates_me_so_much/,

1370832653.0,59,self.googleglass,1g0rl4,"Google made my Glass reception awesome (knighting ceremony) and if you let them know how, they can make yours awesome too!",Mazon_Del,72,13,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/googleglass/comments/1g0rl4/google_made_my_glass_reception_awesome_knighting/,"Greetings everyone!

Saturday I got my Glass from Google at the NYC facility. And it was unexpectedly about 100% MORE awesome then I thought it might be. It already was going well because I decided that myself and my friend would wear our fancy pompous outfits that double as part of our steampunk costumes (My friend is in the red coat and top hat, I am in the suit in the mirror, my own top hat was on the table). And then Google dropped a bombshell on me.

You see, some months ago I posted onto the Glass Explorers G+ page a post asking what the public thought I should do in order for my reception of Glass to include a ""knighting ceremony"". Unfortunately the only responses were some comments from a few of my friends. However!

Google, in its infinite awesomeness, got wind of my request...AND MADE IT HAPPEN! When I walked through the front door and checked in, the woman behind the desk excited asked ""Are you the one getting knighted?"" and I was very surprised as I thought it had gone unnoticed. I affirmed that I was, and she sent a signal off to the other room and asked me and my friend Francesco to stand off to the side for a few minutes.

All of a sudden we heard some Monty Python-esque music coming through the door, and a woman came over and offered her arm, asking if someone would be willing to escort her to the other room. Of course I walked up, hooked my arm in hers and we were off! As we walked through the door into the next room, there were two lines of Google employees that fancily bowed as we passed by each pair.

I was lead to the stage at the end of the room and asked to take a knee. As I knelt, with my hands on the pommel of my umbrella, I was asked to place my hand on a Google Tablet as they swore me in ""Do I swear only to use Glass for good?"" and several other similar questions.

A Google employee then approached at a gesture from the man holding a sword and held out a case for me to take my glass from. I placed it on my head (slightly difficult with a top hat) and looked up at the man, who then drew his sword and recited ""Then I hereby dub the, Marcus, Explorer of Google!"" and tapped my shoulders, before asking me to rise.

There was applauding and everyone was enjoying what had just occurred. As all the employees came equipped with their own Glass sets, there were numerous viewpoints of this glorious event! I'm hoping Google posts the videos for you all to enjoy.

I carry a slight request from them to you.

While not all requests can or will be honored, and while my experience was not typical of your standard Glass reception, these people are just as wonderful and nerdy as all of us who are eagerly awaiting this great product. They enjoy a good bit of showmanship and a break in the norm just as we do. Thus, my message is for people to feel free to attend in costume as we did, post in some fashion (where Google can see it) a request for how your experience can be special, not just for you but for the hard working people that are helping you set things up. Please, do be sensible, but above all have a good time!

I am not an official Google spokesperson (though I'd gladly use my Robotics Engineering degree to aid Google if there was a place for me!) and so of course my statements should be taken as simply a message from me as a random denizen of the internet.

I look forwards to seeing what you all do when your time comes!

Marcus

tl;dr: Google knighted me when I picked up Glass. They may be willing to fulfill other requests if you let them know in advance. I am not a Google Spokesperson.

As you walk around your neighborhood, commute to work, or meet a friend for lunch downtown, you automatically collect resources and leave Trails that mark the environment with the color of your Colony. Crossing Trails left by another ant can signal the location of useful resources, Colony members in need, or rival Colonies encroaching on your territory. A direct encounter with another ant from your Colony might more evenly distribute your resources for the Colony’s benefit, but an encounter with an ant from a different Colony might result in a fight that leaves you without any food at all!

This project is still in the early stages of development, but we want to grow the project with as much user feedback and contributions as possible. We will be holding a Hangout on Google+ this Wednesday, May 22 at 9 PM Eastern to discuss the game, solicit ideas and feedback, and (potentially) recruit a few other people to work on it with us.  If you're interested, please flip through the document and/or show up to the Hangout and chat with us!  We're hoping to release the app for testing sometime in the next six months or so, and we'd love to hear your thoughts.

We'll be monitoring this thread and are happy to respond to question, but we are staging most of our development on G+. Contact us here:

1368210946.0,33,self.googleglass,1e30lp,"Views on Glass' role in your daily life (and why it seems so many reviewers don't yet ""get"" it).",Dopple_Deaner,42,9,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/googleglass/comments/1e30lp/views_on_glass_role_in_your_daily_life_and_why_it/,"In the tech world, there was the era of the PC. The PC was king; it did everything you could do in the tech world, and there was no reason to go beyond it. 

Then came the cell phone. For many, they could see no purpose in talking to people on the phone outdoors. To them, the phone was an event planner and a social tool for home. Then came texting, where people wondered what sort of value something that takes just as long as a phone call and has limited text size could be.

What these people failed to realize was that each of these services, while they did not serve a purpose in demand when they were introduced, found purpose and value through implementation. People found that they actually had a lot of things they wanted to tell each other while they were out (like that they would be home late, or that they were in need of help) and had even more to tell several people at once that only required a few seconds and wasn't urgent.

This is the same sort of crowd that completely misunderstood the Laptop (""who needs to carry around a computer?!?""), then the iPhone (""what does it do that you can't do with a laptop or computer? Who really needs this while they are out?""), then the tablet (""Who would ever want to use a device without a dedicated keyboard? Why watch a TV show alone in a room with other people?""), then TV boxes (""Who honestly wants to watch Youtube videos on their TV together?"").

These same people are now the people that use a desktop at work for high-productivity, a laptop while traveling or in a coffee shop for mid-level productivity, a tablet at home for personal entertainment, their TV box to watch Netflix and Hulu, and their phone to fill in the gaps. **These people, time and time again, only see the product at its most basic level when introduced and fail to see the functionality of its future.**

These same people always sound weird alarms, too. People poked fun at how douchy flip phone users looked early on and how tiny phones were getting. People made fun of iPhone users for carrying around something so cumbersome. People freaked out about the idea of being tracked by phone, people taking pictures of you with their phone in secret, and so much more.

**Google Glass is going through the same ringer right now.** False alarms about personal privacy, jesting at how funny it looks, and trying to indicate its uselessness are all common attacks right now.

Every new technology that succeeds answers a question we always have, but never realize we had. The laptop answered the question of ""how do I get work done when I'm not at my desk?"" The tablet answered the question of ""how do I consume new-age entertainment in bed or on the couch?"" The iPhone answered the question of ""how do I get the information I need when I'm out?""

So, what is Google Glass' question? In my opinion, it's this: **""How do I get and consume the information I want and need while I'm in motion?** In my opinion, any reviewer, any app designer, and any consumer who keeps this question in mind will immediately find the value in Google Glass.

**Google Glass is for when you're walking, running, hiking, driving, standing on a bus or metro train, moving around the grocery store, cleaning the house, or any time you need to minimize distraction.** Each of these situations are moments where using your phone or other device can get awkward, inefficient, or downright dangerous. **This means Google Glass apps need to focus on limited text, high speed, and the fewest distractions possible.**

Glass will be meaningful for me when I want to navigate while I'm downtown  and don't want to look like an idiot glaring at my phone. It's for when I'm standing on the metro and want to hear news updates or listen to NPR/Music without having a cable running down my jacket. It's for when I'm busy cleaning the house/putting away groceries/mowing the yard/cooking and I need access to a tasklist, recipe, or music and still want to see when someone is calling me or texting me. It's for when I'm focused hard on a specific piece of work on my computer, at a press conference, or full-screen gaming and still want to be able to get notifications/take pictures/look polite like I'm paying attention. It's for when I'm watching a sporting event live and want up-to-date stats without looking away. It's for snapping an action shot, getting a pic of that guy who just did a hit and run, and stitching together video from different parts of a hike. It's for taking pictures on a vacation or excursion without ruining the experience by turning the attention of the moment to the process of taking pictures. It's for calling Mom and Dad when I'm somewhere cool so they can share it with me as if they are there. It's for throwing alarms and meeting reminders in my face when I'm working my way around the office doing work away from my desk.

I even personally believe it would make me more productive and safer. Wearing glass, I would close my G+, Reddit, and Facebook tabs at work, knowing that anything I care about going on will be delivered to me. While I'm driving, I will be able to do all the things that most people do while driving anyway (almost everyone today navs off their phone or switch music/text while you're at that stoplight).",,False,self,t5_2tumi,False,,,True,t3_1e30lp,http://www.reddit.com/r/googleglass/comments/1e30lp/views_on_glass_role_in_your_daily_life_and_why_it/,

However, just running the vanilla APKs were no fun - so I had a bit of fun investigating the secret Google Labs.

Google Glass has a series of Labs experiments that can be enabled on engineering or userdebug builds. Using APKTool, I've removed that restriction and now they can be enabled with root access.

To start, for example, the OK_GLASS_EVERYWHERE lab, type in a root shell

`setprop persist.lab.ok_glass_everywhere true`

and restart the Glass home screen.

This is tested with the Xenologer modded APKs for Nexus 7.

If you have an actual Glass (lucky you), you might be able to enable these by using root to edit build.prop so your build shows up as a userdebug instead of a user build, and then using the properties to enable individual labs.

So far, here are my results:

### Known working labs

DEBUG_LAUNCHER: Adds a new option in Settings -&gt; Device Info -&gt; Start Launcher; brings me to the standard Android home screen.

OK_GLASS_EVERYWHERE: you can say ""OK Glass"" even if you are in a different bundle than the home screen; e.g. in the Settings app.

WEB_BROWSING: When you use Glass to Google something, tapping on a result gives you a ""View Website"" prompt. Tapping on it launches Chrome on my Nexus 7; I assume the real Glass hardware will launch a different browser.

WINK: Adds a ""Wink"" option to the Settings bundle. I haven't installed the GlassGestures APK which contains Winking-related code, so I can't test.


### Labs that may do something on the Glass but won't work on a Nexus 7

GCAM: No visible effect. Calls Camera.startGoogleCameraMetering when an app takes the Camera; no clue what that's for, as that method isn't in any AOSP release.

GPS_DEBUG_CARD: Just gives a new blank card in the Settings bundle.

SEARCH_FEEDBACK: No visible effect.

VSTAB and VSTAB_CALIBRATION: Enables video stabilization as seen on http://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/Camera.Parameters.html#setVideoStabilization%28boolean%29 . I did not even bother to try this on the Nexus 7, as I hardly believe the front camera can stabilize video.

The costs wouldn't really be that much considering some of the other equipment that is bought for police officers these days, and on a contracted bulk buy it could be entirely feasable from a budget standpoint. They've already started in some departments with dash cams, why not take it a step further?

It would remove the My word against His word scenario giving credence and support to the reports officers file after every incident as well as protecting the civilians sides of the story.  It would offer up a documented level of truth to any case that would be pretty hard to argue.

It would hold officers accountable for their actions and would combat abuses of authority and power resulting in the building of more trust in the police from a civilian standpoint.  It would also serve as a means for combating corruption as well.

On a typical weekend I usually sleep, play video games, hop between reddit and facebook, and usually spend some time working on projects. This weekend was anything but typical. On Friday I had an appointment to pick-up Google Glass in New York City, which is about 850 miles away from me. I left Thursday night, and despite a minor accident between myself and a semi-trucks left over tire tread I made it there without a scratch. In fact, I ended up arriving 2 hours early and lucky for me Kirsten was able to get me in early.

After setting down my bag Kirsten lead me over to a table with Google Glass  in every color where I was able to try them on to see which color I liked the best. Honestly, every color looks great. I have a vendetta against Shale and Charcoal because that’s the color everyone seems to pick so those were off my list before even trying them on, for the record they both looked great. Then I went for Tangerine, this was a color I planned on getting initially just because it’s such a bold color. Unfortunately I tend to wear a lot v-necks in all sorts of colors so I don’t think it’d match my wardrobe that well, for someone with mostly neutral colors I’d strongly recommend this color though. I then tried on Sky and in all honestly I almost left with them, however going back to matching my wardrobe, I also attend Northern Illinois University so red is one of my go to colors. Then I tried on Cotton, which was the color I picked when I first scheduled my appointment, after a moment of hesitation I decided to stick with it. It’s a neutral color that will match anything I wear while still standing out which will hopefully make others feel more welcome to ask questions about it.

We returned back to where I had left my bag and she informed another person that I chose Cotton and moments later he returned with a box I’ve become all to familiar with while waiting.

The fitting process went very smoothly, I didn’t have to change how the nosepads were positioned and only had to adjust where the screen was . One thing to keep in mind is that Glass will always be in your line of sight but it’s easily ignored until you want to see it. It’s also always in a sleeping state until you wake it up so the majority of the time it’s just a clear rectangle sitting above your right eye. I have gotten several headaches since getting Glass however that could be attributed to barely eating anything the past couple of days.

After I was able to see the projected screen Kirsten walked me through all of the commands and gave me some tips here and there to better use Glass. While I could have figured this out on my own, I am happy I had a resident expert telling me how to use it. My one regret during the appointment was that I didn’t take enough pictures. If you are picking up Glass I’d strongly recommend taking pictures every chance you get during your appointment.

After she had walked me through everything and made sure that I knew what I was doing she walked me to the elevator. While I was waiting for the elevator I bumpted into the manager of the pickup location and after explaining how I drove all night from Illinois he offered to make a stop on another floor to grab a coffee and snacks for me. I can’t refuse free food and coffee, and I definitely can’t say no to seeing another floor of Google’s New York officespace. He also told me about the Highline Park which was only a block away, if not for that tip I wouldn’t have done any sightseeing, nor would I have ran into a couple that broke my “Is that Glass” cherry. Highline Park is beautiful, anyone going to NYC should visit this rooftop garden. The couple were very nice and they seemed to enjoy trying out Glass.

The Questions

I think this would be a good time in the story to talk about the other interactions I’ve had with people. The majority of people don’t say anything about it, they may do a second take, but then just keep walking. I’ve had some people exclaim “Oh my god it’s Glass!” which have thus far been my least favorite interactions just because it makes me feel out of place and awkward. I got a couple smiles and nods, another person gave me a thumbs up while crossing the road, one person walked next to me for about half a block before asking about it. “Do you like Glass” is the main question I’ve been asked so far which is usually answered by saying “So far it’s been working how I expect it to work, no complaints.”

For anyone reading this who may run into me, I’m more than happy to answer questions and providing I’m not busy I’d even be happy to let you try them on and give you a short demo. All I ask is that you are polite.

Initial Impressions

Google Glass is still in development. If I wasn’t told that though I’d assume it was ready to be released to the public. This device has worked near flawlessly thus far. The issues I’ve experienced so far include no network connectivity which was solved by creating a hotspot on my phone, as well as clunky voice commands to call or text people. I’ve been able to take pictures, record videos, and ask Google questions without any issues in both quiet and noisy environments. The picture quality through Glass looks washed out but once I look at them in front of my computer I’m pleasantly surprised by the quality. Are these the best pictures I’ve ever seen? Of course not, but they are exceptional quality for sharing with my friends on Google+, Facebook, or Twitter.",,False,self,t5_2tumi,False,,,True,t3_1gh5lw,http://www.reddit.com/r/googleglass/comments/1gh5lw/my_first_weekend_with_google_glass/,

I thought I'd come in with a text post and offer a sort of AMA. I'm gonna be out for the next few hours but figured people can post in here and I can answer any questions that people have as best I can.

Just as an fyi, I signed up for Google Glass at last year's I/O 2012 and have had them for about a week now. I participated as one of the winning teams at the Pioneer hackathons.

Thanks! :)

I just finished answering the questions while I was away. Apologies for being gone, feel free to add more questions if you'd like. I'll be answering as they come in.

The first thing this made me think of was [a voiceless communication device like this one](http://www.theaudeo.com/?action=technology). I messaged Project Glass a few times asking if they were considering integrating something like that, but got no response. I bring it up whenever I talk to people about Glass, but no one seems excited about the idea.

So what do you think? Is this solution just too far out of reach? Too expensive? Do you think it's a good idea? At this point I'm considering starting a kickstarter to raise the funding to purchase a dev kit so I can develop a mobile app for the device than can later be used to communicate with Glass. Does that even sound like something people would want? Have you heard of anyone else doing something like this in relation to Glass?

If you want to help support me then please [read the post on my blog](http://lifewithglass.net/pain-in-the-glass/159), if not that's fine too.

*Pain In The Glass*

I've been using Google Glass constantly for the past two weeks and while is has been useful, there are just some things about this product that's still in development that are a pain in the ass.

**Not Made For People With Ears**

Maybe I'm just overly enthused about wearable technology, but I've found that it's nearly impossible for me to wear this for an entire day without taking it off. After wearing Google Glass for 4 - 5 hours straight my right ear begins to feel irritated. I'm not sure if it's the added to weight pushing down on the top of my ear or if it's the battery pack forcing my ear out ever so slightly. However one thing is for sure, it kills my ear after extended use.

**Not Made For People With Eyes**

While I love the transparent prism which project the image for me to see, it also isn't perfect. My desk is situated in front of a window that gets a lot of sunlight during the day, and while I tend to leave my blinds closed until around noon to prevent the rising sun from getting in my eyes, I've noticed that even after that my right eye begins to hurt after sometime. This is because the prism catches sunlight which is getting into my eye. The same thing happens when I'm driving at night, car headlights seem to get projected into my eye and it can cause some discomfort if there are a lot of cars.

**Not Made For People Attending Lectures**

I've been wearing Google Glass almost constantly since getting them. I take them off every now and then during the day, and one of those times is when I am in lecture for the business calculus class I'm taking over the summer. I had planned to wear Glass during my lectures because I can use it as a calculator so when my professor needs some simple math done I could get her the answer. Unfortunately with the current Glass OS I'm unable to mute the audible tones that are made when I get a notification. So instead I've found myself turning it off and putting it away for my lecture, I really hope there is an option to mute audio from Glass for a certain amount of time, maybe even allowing me to set a schedule through MyGlass for when to make sounds and when to be quiet.

**Not Made For People Who Walk In The Rain**

This might be nitpicking but while Glass is water resistant, it's not water proof. Considering this is supposed to sit on my head as much as possible a freak storm shouldn't make me rushing to get my umbrella out. This also isn't an unrealistic complaint given that the Samsung Galaxy S4 Active is waterproof. There is also a company named NeverWet that has a treatment which can be used to make your mobile devices waterproof, so hopefully Google can work with this company to treat the consumer versions of Google Glass so I won't be freaking out when it's pouring and my friends won't be freaking out when it's sprinkling.

**Made For People Who Love Technology**

Despite the issues listed above I'm still very happy to have Google Glass and I'm still wearing it as much as possible. I didn't write this article for the purpose of scaring people away from Glass, but rather to give the Glass team an idea of what issues I've faced thus far and hopefully they can make some changes to the consumer version to make the device that much more perfect.",,False,self,t5_2tumi,False,,,True,t3_1hccqe,http://www.reddit.com/r/googleglass/comments/1hccqe/pain_in_the_glass/,

It took a year to give 2,000 devolpers who signed up in person and paid beforehand to get their Glass units. 

On the other hand.. There are 8,000 winners of #ifihadglass
There has been no real registration yet, and I know for a fact a lot of those winners won't end up paying $1,500 even though they were selected. Heck, I even know of some winners that live outside the USA so they aren't eligible either, even though @projectglass selected them. 

I guess what I am getting at, won't it be difficult for Google to give out these next 8,000 glass units?

a top comment quickly changed my perception of Google's free products when it pointed out that this was likely Google's way of tricking consumers into doing the groundwork for a comprehensive 'Footpath' database to enhance their Maps/Navigation tools.




Seeing the specs on Google Glass, I notice there's little strain on the battery or processor of the actual device and that most computation is handled peripherally whether through servers or on your phone. 



Taking that knowledge and using it as a seed to imagine what background processes Google could use Glass for without your knowledge or any detriment to battery life, I wondered if [Google Maps Interiors](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=Gy-DI_bWElg) was a possible secret ulterior use of your Glass ... Combine it with the fact that my GNEX can take [360 Degree Panos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=kMWxBpM-MSA) and I'm starting to think they can take millions of low-res snapshots and either sell this data in augmented reality applications for law enforcement, government intelligence, or even offer a packaged product that will enhance advertisement and reach for a business like that video above. *with a lot of the work being handled by the consumer*






[[TL;DR]] The Augmented Reality Game ['Ingress'](http://youtu.be/PhT1ToPU3WA) is likely a tool for Google to get us to do a lot of the work for them regarding footpath maps and directions.

I've never been a very big Google fan, but I like that they push the limits and Glass seems to be right on track. One of my friends was at Google I/O last year and received his Glass a few weeks ago through the Glass Explorer program.

Right when I put it on I was amazed at how easy it was to watch the screen/display. I've heard people hate it, or it gives them headaches, but for me, I had no problem watching the video that was playing on it when my friend handed it to me. The text on the screen is very easy to read and really does appear like a 6 to 8 inch screen out in front of you. The audio is awesome, as is the audio and video capture. Response time for motions are great and speech recognition seems pretty legit - probably helps that Google has years of GoogleVoice under the belt.

Google could easily use Glass as a way to move in to the hardware business, but they could also use it as they've used the Nexus line: a way to get more information, and thus subsidize the cost. If they go with the former option, then Glass will probably remain expensive (but maybe not $1,500 expensive). If they go the other route, then we could see Glass hitting a very cheap price quickly, which would be excellent for many of us.

I am just looking to voice my opinion about what I am looking forward to. I checked the sidebar, if this violates any rule, please let me know. 

Some things I am about to say have been said before. I am just repeating them to say them again. 

Hardware:

•A smaller design, people say it feels too bulky. 

•Maybe more discreet. That might not matter when society gets used to seeing them around. 

•I believe Google said they were meeting with glasses companies. I would love a ""clip-on"" Glass that you can put on multiple sets of glasses. 

•Maybe a ""case"" so there are more than 5 colors?

•Don't just sell them online, let retail stores but them, too. 

•Maybe make the left part of the glass a bigger better battery? Only one half of the Glass (the right) is being used. 

•I realize the $1,500 price isn't final. But a smaller price tag is almost a must for me. The projected price range is $500-$1,000, but would be amazed if it got to the price of an iPhone. 

Software:

(I am also going to list app ideas, incase it sparks any ideas. Probably not, but oh well. )

•A RES type tagging system. 

•When they become more common, an ""Alternate Glass Display."" Here is an example:

You are visiting Germany. You don't speak German. You see another person with a Glass on, and you have to ask him a question. He doesn't speak English. You say ""Ok glass, connect to the man in front of me."" He gets a request he can accept or deny. Let's that he accepts. When you speak on English, it would display those words in German on his screen, and vice versa. 

•A ""Only Me"" voice recognition system. So even when it is on, glass only responds to your voice. You can put it in guest mode to turn it off, or just go and turn it off anyways. 

I might be adding things later. Please, feedback!

For example, the demo showed how to respond to an email but I don't think they showed that you could do anything with a service without either interacting with a timeline card or through the share functionality.

You can say ""ok glass ... take a picture"", but will you be able to say things like ""ok glass ... gmail ... compose"" or ""ok glass ... evernote ... voice note""? I think I've seen some demos where people said ""ok glass ... post to Google+"", and if Google+ is just a service, then it should work for others. I think.

One use case that would interest me is setting up a service for my home automation system, so that I could say ""ok glass ... home ... turn on the lights.""

I've been carefully looking at many of the submissions as they roll out everyday and have come to a few conclusions:

1.) Many of the winners don't realize they need to pay $1500 let alone find a way to make it to a launch event to pick up the glasses (can lead to even more $$$)

2.) Because of the above, I wouldn't be surprised if the 8,000 people Google invited translates into less than half actually going through with the purchase when Google sends out the paywall. (Could be even less than 50%, I'm being generous)

3.) Google will realize it's going to look really bad that they sent out 8,000 invites and not even half of the ""winners"" chose to buy. (Partially their own fault for having a dumpy algorithm randomly pick people)

4.) Knowing that it will be pretty bad PR at the launch events to have only a fraction of the 8,000 invites show up, they will decide to run another contest beforehand, and will hopefully have better control of it to prevent many of the issues this one had.

On a side note, I'm quite unhappy about how this whole thing was handled. I've seen people who were picked as a winner on Google+ also get an invite on Twitter the next day. Google is one of the biggest collectors/analyzers of data in the world. You're telling me they couldn't have found a way to prevent people who submitted on both Google+ and Twitter to get accepted in twice? The fact that anyone believes that an outside panel picked these answers is insane. Take the time to do a search on Twitter and look at some of the winners. You've got people who won for literally tweeting ""#ifihadglass"" or just take a look at all the ""winning"" entries here: http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/03/google-glass-winners-ifihadglass-competition.html

In watering places where the disease rages persons who venture to move from one place to another are sure to be stopped by the cry: ""Hullo there! Don't walk in front of my camera,"" and people who are sitting down are constantly besought to ""sit still a few moments. You're in a picture and you'll spoil it if you move."" Thus people in perfect health are constantly harassed by those who have contracted the *camera lamina sicca.*

Furthermore, no one can feel sure at any moment that a camera has not been brought to bear upon him. If a young man and a young woman sit down side by side in an apparently quiet nook among the sand dunes, or by a mountain stream, it will not be ten minutes before a dozen or fifteen cameras will be trained upon them. Even when walking quietly in the public street a person is not safe, for not only is he constantly made the victim of the instantaneous process by camera lunatics concealed behind window curtains, but the inoffensive theological student with what is apparently an innocent handbag in his hand, who passes slowly along the street, may have a camera disguised as a handbag and may be taking ""instantaneous views"" without exciting the slightest suspicion. Things have come to such a pass that no lady can step out of a carriage without the fear that every stripe has been surreptitiously caught by a shameless camera, and no man can offer a lady the slightest attention and feel sure that his innocent action has not been forever perpetuated in gelatine emulsion as enduring as brass.

1. Does anyone know anything specific about the events we'll pick them up at? I know that we'll hear in a few weeks, but does that mean the events will be in a few weeks or will we just learn at that time when/where the events are? Will we pay for the glasses ahead of time? Will the events be during the day or at night? I'm trying to plan some business trips and don't want to be away from NYC when the events are held.

2. My [tweet](https://twitter.com/projectglass/status/317438663690702848) idea involved proposing to my girlfriend. She also uses Twitter and so purposely sent it later at night hoping she wouldn't see the tweet in her stream. I'd like to make sure she doesn't see that tweet before I actually propose to her, but I'm worried that if I take the tweet down that I'll be violating the rules of the contest and won't get the glasses... any insight or suggestions?

* Is there a specific way to prompt the XE5 update? I have had the device for about 26 hours now and still no update.

* What is the method to install apps such as Winky and other 3rd party apps. Is it simple adb commands just like android?

* Speaking of such apps, is there one place to find all of them, or do we have to do some digging ourselves.


Other than that I am really excited to have Glass finally and see what it is all about!

Always a complaint about the fact that you can't tell if you're being recorded when you interact with someone wearing Glass.  Everyone is justifiably concerned about their privacy.

The only solution that people give is to put a little LED that indicates when pictures and video are being taken.  Those concerned immediately reply that Glass can be rooted and jailbroken and the light can be deactivated.

Solution: put a physical shutter over the camera that closes when the camera isn't in use.  No more complaints.  Camera shut, you're not being recorded.  Camera open, you should probably assume you're being recorded.

Sure mechanical parts break occasionally, but I think Google has some pretty capable engineers to design something robust and I think it's worth having a glass occasionally break in order to allow people wearing your product to be treated like a human and not like a walking surveillance drone.",,False,self,t5_2tumi,False,,,True,t3_1djcld,http://www.reddit.com/r/googleglass/comments/1djcld/solution_to_the_number_one_privacy_complaint_that/,

However, I have heard nothing but skepticism from my friends and family, and nothing but bold and unshakeable confidence from the Net. So here are a few of the lines of reasoning I have heard regarding glass. Feel free to add your own.

**Skeptical**

* Tech leads to anti-social behavior and this is just the next step in the inevitable march towards the disintegration of society. People will use it in every situation and it will be more distracting and disrespectful than current phones. (Programmer friend - 25 Male)

* It looks weird and I wouldn't be caught dead wearing something that creepy. (Sister, 22)

* I don't want to talk to my phone all the time, people will hear me. How am I supposed to use it in church? (Mom, 51)

* Creepers will take pictures of you. (Friend, Female, 28)

* I just don't think I would ever wear it. I'm inside looking at a computer screen all day and all night anyways. (Coworker, Male, 26)

**Hopeful**

* It's futuristic! and it's gababrbrbabrrr I want one! (fucking all of twitter)

* It's going to be great for travelling around foreign cities and not getting lost. (Boss, Male, 26)

* It's a step in the right direction for mobile tech's user experience. Ideally, you would just have a phone in your brain, that you can manipulate and sense just like another hand, and you could radio-telepathically communicate with anyone, geographic and linguistic barriers be damned. Glass is as close as we can reasonable get to that with current tech and laws. (Myself, Male, 25)

* Seems like a slick device. Can it scan for life forms on an alien planet? (Dad, 58)

Anyways, these all my own paraphrased recollections of what I've heard. but that's the gist of it. I hope to convince all these skeptics that it really is an improvement on current phones, and that having a HUD is fucking cool no matter what it looks like, although I'd prefer it looked more like a pair of WW2 round-lensed pilot's goggles.",,False,self,t5_2tumi,False,,,True,t3_1cu4ew,http://www.reddit.com/r/googleglass/comments/1cu4ew/a_compilation_of_the_hopeful_and_skeptical/,

Many of the items you buy from a retails store (especially groceries) are staged at a local warehouse.  Large trucks with one item are unloaded.  Then a mixed truck is packed with a variety of items for the next couple of days.

There are teams of people in the warehouse driving around, picking what the mixed truck needs from shelves.  Amazon uses a similar method.  

[Here is what they currently use](http://www.logimatic.com/Pick-by-Voice).  It is an machine voice system.  That tells the user what is the next part and where to get it.  The user tells the machine when they get the part.

But Google glass would be far better.  It could highlight the specific box for picking instead of the user scanning the shelves.  It could scan the barcode and update the inventory instead of the user having to pull out a manual scanner.  Finally - the employee to could talk to their boss.

Other than perhaps having a standard, what would prevent someone from having a custom visor created for a prescription _for this model_? From what I can tell from photos, it doesn't look like much could get in the way for attaching an arbitrary customized visor of similar shape?

Does anyone know if this visor _does_ follow some sort of standard (that's perhaps used on sports glasses), or is it just arbitrary?

Could someone include some good photos of the clear visor detached and attached? Can the mechanism used to attach the visor to the unit be taken off of a visor? How does it exactly attach to the glasses? (Looks like some sort of spring-loaded assembly, but that's only a guess from what I could tell from the few Engadget photos).

And read a few blog posts but haven't been able to get some answers. Perhaps my Google-fu needs more training. Anyway, I hope some of you guys/gals can help with the following questions:

* Does Glass need an always online connection?
* If not, will some features be unavailable if not connected to wifi/a phone, which features would be unavailable?
* Is voice processing done on Glass? Or it is offloaded to a server?
* Does GPS work without having to pair Glass with a phone?
* On one of the Glass adverts there's a scene where some one is in a plane doing loops and in a Hangout with people watching, is that actually possible? 
* I've read that native Apps can be created to run on Glass, how much processing power does Glass have?

I know its popular in games but im suprised I haven't seen anything like this for google glass. it seems like the tech is available- why haven't they made this a feature? it seems like some gps and an XYZ display would be about what it takes. tell me why this is dumb.

1. After watching that [SXSW talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpWmGX55a40), I got a better sense of how 'apps' will be laid out. It seems he only really addressed things that will periodically push cards to your collection for you to look at as you scroll through (or not.. if you choose). Will there be any kind of apps that you can 'open' and work with specifically? For example, a Soundhound app that you can just open when you hear music you'd like to analyze for the name like you would on your phone. You're not just going to wait for its card to come up, can you specifically open it?

2. I haven't seen any mention of an app market, if they'll even be called 'apps' because in that video he seemed to only refer to them as 'Glass services'. Would you imagine they'll have a paid apps market? I did see that one post about the expense involved in running your server to interact with the REST API so there must be some kind of paid apps system. Anything confirmed here?

3. I'm what you could call a 'developer' from building apps and sites of all kinds, but I guess I've never really written some kind of server app. Probably not even the right term for that. I've been reading through [this](http://www.tuxradar.com/content/code-project-create-web-server-ruby), does that put me on the right track? Would it be smart to write this in Ruby? If not, what should I look to writing it in. Finally, say I do build a decent Glass app. Would it be a good idea to build my own physical server that I can maintain myself or should I just go with some kind of existing service?

Diesmal sind wichtige gelungene Neuerungen impliziert:

Glass Web Browser mit einem geniales Bedienkonzept
neue Sprachfunktionen („In-App“)
Such-Optimierung

Glass Web Browser
Besonders freuen dürfen sich die Besitzer einer Google Glass über den neuen Web-Browser, dessen Bedienung sehr gelungen ist. Eine Websuche endete bis jetzt mit einem kurzen Anrisstext aus Wikipedia. Das neue Konzept lässt den Benutzer auf Websiten hoch und runter scrollen indem er den Finger auf das Touchpad des rechten Brillenbügels legt und nach oben oder unten bewegt. Um auf einer Website heran zu zoomen bewegt der Träger zwei Finger auf dem Touchpad aus einander. Auch sehr benutzerfreundlich gelöst ist die Navigation auf einer gezoomten Website. Zwei Finger auf dem Touchpad und die jeweilige Kopfbewegung führen den Benutzer zu dem Teil der Seite die er sehem möchte. Um einen Link anzuklicken, fokussiert man diesen an und tippt auf das Touchpad. Dieses Konzept ist anfangs übungsbedürftig, lässt sich jedoch schnell lernen.
Ab sofort lassen sich auch Youtube Videos auf Google Glass ansehen.

Neue Sprachfunktionen
Bis jetzt ließen sich Sprachbefehle nur im Hauptmenü mit „Okay, Glass ...“ ausführen. Google spendiert der Datenbrille mit dem Update XE7 nun auch „In-App“ Sprachbefehle. Durch neue Befehle wie “Ok Glass, read aloud” ließt Google Glass dem Träger erstmals auch Nachrichten und Emails vor. Auch der automatische Import von Gmail Kontakten in das Adressbuch und der Versand  von SMS an alle Personen der Kontaktliste ist nun möglich.

Suche
Hinzu kommen noch verschiedene Optimierungen an der Sprachsuche von Glass, etwa die Option bei der Suche nach einem bestimmten Objekt (Empire State Building), weitere Detailfragen zu tätigen, ohne das Gesuchte noch einmal wiederholen zu müssen.

1. If you have T-Mobile what plan do you have and does it work well?
2. Are the plans the same except: 
a) Top one allows me to use my phone or tether for first 4.5GB and then after that I only have 2G access?
b) Bottom plan only gives me 500MB of highspeed data on phone or tethering, and then I 2g after that.

Background: I currently have Glass with an iPhone 4s on Verizon. I want to switch to an Android device to get GPS and SMS capabilities and I also don't love that I have to pay $20/month for bluetooth tethering on verizon and so I am planning on switching to T-Mobile due to it being a GSM carrier, their handsets, and corp discount pricing I can get through my work. 

Things to keep in mind: 
1. I use 1-2GB of data on my phone (handset only) in a typical month. 
2. This month with the verizon mobile hotspot I've used about 2GB of that data tethering my Glass.

I went running around the park with it, got a lot of stares. I'm not sure if I like the attention. My fiance also said that she would never want to go out in public with me wearing it. People I show it to either reference that SNL skit that made fun of it, an article they read that called the glass wearers ""glassholes"", and how they would never spend $1500 on such a thing. At the same time, there are lots of positive reactions and curiosity. 

Also, I have an iPhone 5, and google glass doesn't support the 3 most important functions that I KNOW I would be using the most: text messaging, GPS navigation, and ability to mirror what you see on your glasses (it takes a lot of explaining otherwise). 

I signed up for the glasses to be an early adopter, to pioneer a potentially amazing product. I quit my job 3 weeks ago so that I can learn programming. Wearable computing will be the future, but society just isn't ready for it yet. We need to be brave enough to take the first step. We are the catalyst to this social change.

It is too advanced. Sure it's cool with all that it can do, but I will never need it. All I really need is this:

1. single eye HMD, which Google pretty much have got right, except for the fact that they're talking about a 25"" display from 8 feet away. If instead we translate it, more or less, to a 12.5"" display from 4 feet away, we start to see the problem.
2. The audio, i.e. ""Bone Conduction Transducer"" is perfect, assuming it works as intended.
3. A microphone would be nice.
4. A way of connecting it all with a device of my own choosing. Be it a mobile phone, Raspberry Pie in my back pocket, laptop, desktop, pda, mp3 player, etc.

The rest is garbage, seen with my eyes of course, and I've been trying to wrap my head around this trend for a very long time, because it's always like this, not specifically with Google, but all the huge companies. You always get more than you ask for and it almost always  end up making it a worse product.

There are many companies out there who would be wise to consider the GNU/Linux approach. By making things simpler and making them do less, you often end up enabling them to do more than expected. At the least they will do what they were designed to do and do it extremely well. This however will not happen with Google Glass as is.

        Few days before the release of Google Glass Explorer Edition, a cup of Ginger Tea in the lucky evening energized my brain to evangelize the scope,the future and technicality of Glass Custom Apps and some of them are turning into reality in a very fast pace. I'm quite excited about it!! Here are The 5 Top Glass Apps that trended among Google Glass Communities and enthusiasts since the launch of Mirror API.They are also the early-birds in Glass Apps ecosystem:
1. NYT'S GLASS APP - The First Media Glass App:
NYT's Google Glass App is the first third-party Glass App and it reads 
the articles and news's summaries. It is also the first media app for 
Google Glass.
2. JONATHAN GOTTRIED'S GLASSTWEET- Social Media App: 
GlassTweet is an App for Twitter and it allows to Tweet pictures and 
videos from GoogleGlass by connecting the App to a Twitter Account.
3. PATH-Photo Sharing Glass App:
This is the first preloaded Third-Party Google Glass App and it is meant to work for Path just like with standard Mobiles or Smartphones but inside the Google Glass ecosystem.
4. GLASSFEED-Glass App For RSS Feed:
GlassFeed is a brilliant App to post to an RSS Feed. IFTTT allows to   
share or exchange these contents from GoogleGlass to Social Networking Site like Google Plus, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.
5. GLASSDRIVE- Glass App For Cloud Services:
This is another great app that allows to share the videos or photos taken from Google Glass to Google Drive.
6. STALKING APP -Glass App For Object Recognition:
Stalking App is another brilliant Glass App that identifies people by their wearables(Clothes). It is Glass App in object recognition category.

Which seems to me to indicate that those two functions are actually happening on your android phone, and Glass is just being used as an input or display. Everything else that Glass does is actually being handled on the headset, and so it just needs an internet connection.

I think this functionality, having an app on your phone send some data to Glass for display or get an input from Glass, is the most interesting thing Glass can do.

Unlike Google’s bifocal design, the iPatch will cover only one eye. 

The iPatch is rumored to boast an updated version of iOS, featuring a Siri like speech assistant called Polly. It’s thought that Polly will repeat all the user’s commands in a chirpy, parrot like voice before executing them.

Senior technology editor of Tech and Tinge of The Truth, Walker D. Plank explains, “This is typical of Apple. They often design products in the most intuitive, ergonomic and stylish way. Everyone knows eye-patches are more bad-ass and pragmatic than glasses.” 

Walker adds, “Despite recent skepticism around Apple’s product pipeline, the company seems to be keeping its eye on the competition.”

But seriously, I think that these glasses will be as ubiquitous as cell phones in 5 years. Apple's glasses, rumored to target business users seems to be a strange twist for a company who's core competency is consumers.
