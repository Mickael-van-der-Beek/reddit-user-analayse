In my youth I was a huge Nintendo fan. My mum got me a Super Nintendo when I was about five years old, which I love and still play today. I missed out on the N64 (Mum said the games were too expensive and got me a playstation!), but I then got the Gamecube and Wii when they came out, and I even imported a Nintendo DS from America before they even came out in Europe.

My whole life i've received what could be basically described as a lot of shit for being a Nintendo fan. At secondary school people called the Gamecube a ""Gaycube"", and I have always felt my peers have never really understood Nintendo. This generation is no different, and my friends, who are now adults feel that the Nintendo Wii U is a kiddy console, with poor graphics and no games.

Since around 2005 I have also been big on PC gaming, playing the standard Battlefield 2, World of Warcraft, CSS, Half life 2 and other games of the era. Now this is why I have always felt Nintendo and PC gaming go hand in hand. Basically, I have my Nintendo console for my multi-player couch games, melee and Mario Kart etc. I have my PC for my single player non Nintendo games, which have recently included games such as GTA4 and Bioshock, games which I can not play on Nintendo.

I suppose how I feel is that the reason I get a Nintendo console is sorely for the Nintendo games. I think Nintendo is great, and the stuff which Nintendo makes never fails to entertain me and bring me back to my childhood, which is fantastic. At the same time, PC Gaming covers my competitive side and I guess my more mature side, playing shooting games like CS:GO, Dota2 and other games which you don't get on Nintendo.

This is why I feel XBOX and PS3 users have always missed the point. Games such as GTA, games which are on the XBOX and PS3 but not on Nintendo, I can find 90% of the time on my computer, usually with better graphics and support. But if I wanted to play Mario? Well only Nintendo can cover that. And that is why I feel Nintendo and PC gaming go hand in hand! The best of both worlds, together, and it covers nearly every game I want to play (other than Red Dead Redpemtion, but it's an easy trade when compared to Super Mario Galaxies 2!).",,False,,t5_2qhnk,1367259421.0,,basicdonkeykong,True,t3_1dcb8t,http://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1dcb8t/why_i_feel_nintendo_and_pc_gaming_go_hand_in_hand/,

My Wii was a launch model that I got the day it was released, and it had stopped sending an image to the screen about 3 years ago, so obviously the warranty was expired. I wasn't expecting much, maybe they would give me some eShop credit or something.

When I called in and explained the situation, they first told me that they could potentially give me some eShop credit or give me a $25 discount on a repair (the repair costs $85 normally). After I explained that I wouldn't bother repairing the console since I had bought a Wii U, I was transferred to another person. This person told me that he would actually offer me a free repair. So I sent the Wii in.

Tonight I got home from work and the package had already been returned. Inside the box was clearly a new console (it was black when my model was white) and all my VC games were on it. I was able to transfer all my games to the Wii U, and tonight I got to play some Donkey Kong Country! 

Long story short, Nintendo is awesome and did not need to do this. The fact they did this for me just earned them even more respect from me. ",,False,,t5_2qhnk,False,,,True,t3_1dlds9,http://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1dlds9/nintendo_has_the_best_customer_service/,

Melee. Should be fun! Well I checked the event list and saw there was one left.. Event 50. Player vs. Master Hand and Crazy Hand. Bound and determined,  combined with my reflexes and skills (and LOTS of caffeine) I did it!! 


Feeling triumphant, I make a well deserved victory meal.

...Until I see Event 51. The Showdown. Yes, the event that puts the difficulty of all others to shame. I braced myself for an epic fight. 
 
2 hours pass by, sweat beading off of my brow as I am slammed repeatedly by the likes of Giga Bowser, Ganondorf, and MewTwo. I begin to give up hope..
But I gave it one more try, with my favorite character, Fox. I spam away my up B special to dart around the stage. Giga bowsers claws are flying, the other two minions not far behind. I manage to bring giga bowser down to his last life, and MewTwo is no more. Shit's intense. Soon, I'm down to one life, 100% damage. I knew my end was near.. Then, SUDDENLY, a stroke of luck appeared!! A warp star appears in the center stage. I race like all hell and grab that fucker mere *seconds* before Giga Bowser does his down B special (Bowser Bomb). I fly high into the air and CRASH ON HIS MOTHER-FUCKING HEAD AND SEND HIM FLYING!! 

I then assert my newly gained dominance by shooting Ganondorf repeatedly until his shield breaks several times and his damage is near 300% and send that asshat flying! 

Today was a good day.

FPS.  Imagine a class based fps Mario game designed around fun, team work, open maps...I've been thinking about this all week.  We have the characters, the classes, the power ups/shot(kill)streaks, the locales, all of it.  Mario Kart and Smash brothers has been huge, as have the basketball, tennis, golf, party games - all of it.  However there is nothing in the shooter market.  It does not have to be gory, it does not have to be bloody, but it would rival Battlefield, Call of Duty, Team Fortress and Counter Strike in terms of possibilities.  I understand this may sound crazy - but people thought the same thing about Smash Brothers.

1369066755.0,243,self.nintendo,1ep8xb,[A Nintendo Fan] Why I am sick and tired of Electronic Arts' bullshit. (Also posted on r/games),Exoma,316,73,110,http://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1ep8xb/a_nintendo_fan_why_i_am_sick_and_tired_of/,"Since I can remember, EA has always given Nintendo the cold shoulder which in turn led to alienation of the Nintendo consumer base.

I began to notice this with their sports franchises; Madden, FIFA, NHL, etc. and how little effort they would put into their Nintendo ports. 

In fact, the last good EA Nintendo sports games were, in my opinion FIFA 99 for the Nintendo 64 and NHL 99 for the Nintendo 64. Ever since, EA has always provided Nintendo with poor games and has blamed Nintendo for the lack of EA sales.

FIFA

I remember feeling so ripped off with the 2006 FIFA World Cup game for the Gamecube. Not only was it riddled with bugs (Bugs that were not present in the PS2 version of the game) but they had literally mismatched the faces for certain players in the game, ie Ali Karimi's face swapped with Rooney's. Not only that, but the port was so poorly made all the texts were so blurred out you had to purchase a component cable for the Gamecube to be able to actually read the words. They blamed Nintendo for their lack of sales.

FIFA 13 for the Wii U is a scam. It is NOT the same game as FIFA 13 for the PS3 and Xbox 360. It uses the FIFA 12 engine and is riddled with bugs. 
1.
Sometimes the game will just randomly call a penalty shot for no reason

2.
FIFA has completely taken out Creation Centre

3.
The simulation of a season takes longer than on the PS3. (Keep in mind 2GB of RAM vs 256MB of RAM.)


The reason most people buy FIFA now is because of 1. The gameplay mechanics and 2. Creation Centre. Both of these things are not present in the Wii U version of FIFA.

Who does EA blame? Nintendo. Who suffers? The consumer. I felt robbed.

Origin From what I know, this whole thing began because Nintendo did not want to put up with EA's Origin bullshit. Electronic Arts wanted to provide an Origin micro-transaction eShop type service for their games through the Wii U, but Nintendo's business model is a unified eShop under their own application. 

Crysis

I don't believe all this crap about Crysis 3 not being able to run on the Wii U. I just don't believe it and you shouldn't either. This was obviously a business disagreement between Nintendo and EA and I assume it was another case of Nintendo not putting up with EA's bullshit. 

http://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/crytek-says-that-its-nintendo-wii-u-version-of-crysis-3-had-to-die/

Digital Trends also has an article stating nearly the same thing. 

EA's smear campaign

Electronic Arts has begun a smear campaign against Nintendo what with all these tweets from EA employees like Bob Summerwill calling the Wii U ""Crap"". It's really annoying. In fact, it sucks a lot. Because when a developer begins to call the Wii U crap, other developers might blame struggles on Nintendo as well which means less support for Nintendo which means less video games for me. This also alienates the consumer and it prevents Nintendo's customers from potentially playing some really fun games.

Why don't you just buy the game on PS3/Xbox 360 and quit your bitching, Exoma?

I'm glad you asked. The reason I would rather buy it on the Wii U is because of the Gamepad. I like it. I really really like it. When Nintendo first announced the system, my imagination went wild with all the possibilities of multiplayer and single player gaming and I had assumed companies like EA would share my enthusiasm is bring fun and excitement to gamers. Instead, they let business get in the way of ethics and enjoyment. 

SimCity and NHL are great examples. EA's Origin DRM feature is what in my opinion completely ruined SimCity. EA lied to its customers, saying the game was not able to run offline, but it was a developer that stood up and said it in fact was able to run offline. It was obviously a greedy executive decision to have DRM on SimCity which completely broke the game.

NHL has been the exact same thing every year. In fact, I think they have been calling ""360 movement"" and ""Skill Stick"" a new feature every single year NHL has come out. I noticed absolutely no difference between NHL 11 and NHL 13, instead I ended up spending over $100 on Roster Updates going from NHL 11, 12 then to 13. And boy am I fed up.

So am I happy EA is no longer making games for Nintendo? YES. I am very happy, because I will not longer be driven to temptation to purchase the exact same title every year with a new roster update. 

YES because I will now be able to close my Origin account for good.

YES because now I can spend my money on games created by independent developers that don't have evil business strategies. 

YES because now I can stick to Pro Evolution Soccer without double guessing myself.

So thank you, EA. Thank you for no longer developing games for Nintendo. Now if you don't mind, I'm going to go rock some Soul Calibur 2 on my Gamecube.

PS: I'd like to apologize for any spelling or grammar errors.

1370268593.0,206,self.nintendo,1fkxl7,Itching for some new Smash Bros? Try out this 77-stage version of Project M!,Garbagehead4,248,42,151,http://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1fkxl7/itching_for_some_new_smash_bros_try_out_this/,"**NEW TO PROJECT M?**

Generally speaking, Project M is a fan-made mod of Brawl to implement Melee physics and allow for every character to be viable for tournament play. It is an interesting 70:30 crossbreed of Melee and Brawl. The amount of effort the developers put into this mod is staggering -- even the tiniest details are treated with intense scrutiny. Also, Project M is designed to play on both hacked and hackless Wiis; thus, here is no need to hack your Wii in order to play it. This description doesn't exactly do the game justice, I recommend you check out the P:M website for a more complete summary: http://projectm.dantarion.com/about/
Also, here's what other people think of the game: http://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/1en2tm/people_who_played_project_m_is_it_worth_it_whats/

**Keep in mind that Project M is still a demo.** Not all the characters have been finished yet, but they will be in the future.

I've come to realize that Project M could easily become *the* definitive Smash game. It's the skill ceiling of Melee, the sheer vastness of Brawl, and the charm of 64 all rolled into one. That said, I found the stage selection a bit lacking after playing for hours on end. That's where my 77 stage build comes in. 

Here's photos of the Stage Select Screen (SSS): http://imgur.com/a/zt8qT The images were uploaded twice for some reason, sorry. All stages are listed in order below.

So what do you need to get Project M? There are a number of ways to go about this, but I'll show you the simplest and least time consuming way. This is the method used for hackless Wiis, although hacked ones should be able to use this as well. Here's what you need:

* A Wii

* A copy of Brawl

* A 1GB or 2GB SD card (important!)

* A computer that reads SD cards

Why the SD card size limit? Because under normal circumstances, Brawl cannot read SD cards greater than 2GB. There are ways to work around this of course, best detailed in [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/1bprr2/for_those_of_you_new_to_hacking_and_dont_know/) guide.

So you've got all the stuff together, now what? 

* First of all, start up Brawl like normal, leaving your SD card out. Go to stage builder and delete all of your custom stages (this is necessary for P:M to work -- trust me, you won't regret doing so).

* Next, download P:M from the 'Download' section below. Open the .rar file and extract *all* of its contents onto your SD card (which should already be empty).

* Insert your SD card into your Wii and start Brawl like normal. Go to stage builder. Some text should flash on screen and a menu will appear. Select 'Launch Game'.

That's all there is to it! Have fun smashing!

**REASONS TO DOWNLOAD:**
If you want a cumulative collection of stages from the entire Smash series, and then some (77 total). It's like the greatest hits album of stages, plus new remixes and unreleased content. This build is perfect if you typically choose your stages manually and aren't planning to use your copy of Project M in a tournament. Lastly, if you're a complete n00b to Project M, this is a great opportunity to get started.

**REASONS TO NOT DOWNLOAD:**
If random stage selection and stage striking are critical to your gameplay. Certain stages will never be selected when random is pressed, due to a side effect of the SSS expansion code. Many of the preview images on the stage select screen are of low resolution to prevent freezing; if the low quality bothers you, it probably isn't a good idea to download. If you have a ton of custom content already on your SD card and don't want to go through the hassle of sorting it out, download as you see fit.

**DOWNLOAD**

* Download the .rar file: https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B1XVf-zdlELwMVBoUnpRQXVTams/edit?usp=sharing (approx. 500MB)

* Extract all the files to an empty 1 or 2 GB SD card.

* Remember to delete your custom stages in normal Brawl if you haven't already, load up stage builder, and enjoy.

Not all the stages are perfect; if there's some that are a chore to play on, let me know! Your feedback is greatly appreciated!

**CREDITS**
Major props go out to the Project M development team, for creating this amazing mod. This build wouldn't be possible without libertyernie's Classic Expansion Pack, he deserves a ton of credit for assembling the framework of the 77-stage SSS. Also, thank you to all the stage creators out there, you know who you are.

Sent it off to Nintendo for a repair, and two days later in came an estimated cost of 125 + tax + shipping/handling ($152.55 in total). Not too far off from buying a new one, I almost decided to write it off. I called them up to see if anything could be done about the price. Explained the situation, and casually mentioned recent purchases (Wii U before xmas, 2 3DS XL's including this one 2-3 months ago for my g/f and I, etc).. and he had no problem working with me on the price. The agent asked what I would be comfortable with, and gave me a repair cost of $62.15 including tax. ($80 off as a goodwill credit) He was polite and sympathetic through the whole thing.

Let's not let nintendo cater only to the japanese market, the western market depends upon online gaming for multiplayer because of how spread out things are. Yes, local multiplayer is awesome, and you lose that 'personal touch' when playing online. But this doesn't mean online should be ignored as an option. 
If all developers thought like Nintendo, no games would have online modes today.


Let's make this a reality, we can't let Nintendo games continue to ignore online functionalities. It's 2013 and Nintendo shouldn't be excused for not implementing online features just because ""it's hard"" or ""it would cost them money."" Sony and MS have invested the money into these functions, and Nintendo should not be excused. 

If the Wii U wants to be a truly next-gen console, it at least has to have basic past-gen features in its games. We don't all live in Japan or dense metropolitan cities.

The ability to have only one console hooked-up to my TV instead of 2.

What did I lose?

The ability to use Gamecube controllers in Mariokart, Smash Bros, and all VC games. Access to most of the Wii's online features, other than the store. A bunch of miscellaneous content like the ""Metroid Prime 3 Preview Channel,"" and other weird Wii channels.

The transfer took a lot of time and trouble, and in the end I feel like it was mostly a losing transaction.

So... [some very helpful employees of GameStop came through in a big way.](http://i.imgur.com/7mxbVPO.jpg)

I've been reminded this last week that companies are nothing more than a collection of different people. Some of those people are going to be cool, and some are going to be jerks, just like in the rest of the world. Well, from where I'm sitting now, GameStop employs way more cooler people than jerks, and they've earned my business.

Within a day, corporate HQ was able to find me a used copy of the game and overnight it to me FREE OF CHARGE. Meanwhile a friendly redditor/GS employee (who wishes to remain anonymous) was able to find me a used copy in his store, which I quickly bought. So now where I once had none, I have more than I could need...

[So I'm selling one and donating 100% of the profits to Child's Play.](http://www.ebay.com/itm/251244157783?ssPageName=STRK:MESELX:IT&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1555.l2649) This feels like the right thing to do.

Why do you want Nintendo to be what everyone else is? Why can't they be them and Nintendo be Nintendo?


Why should Nintendo target the adult male gamer when everyone else is already doing that? Who would fill for the fans that Nintendo currently caters to? Do you understand that Nintendo is literally the only developer in the industry making high quality games NOT aimed at the typical gamer?



If you want something else there's a million other options. If you want things like what Nintendo offers, there's very few options.

1371100181.0,163,self.nintendo,1g90c0,"I played all games at the Best Buy booth. Here's my very detailed impressions, and what I noticed.",Wiwiweb,175,12,70,http://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1g90c0/i_played_all_games_at_the_best_buy_booth_heres_my/,"I was at the Vancouver Best Buy. I arrived right on time, only to find a quite lengthy queue already. I was surprised to see there was only one booth, playing all 4 games. I at least expected one booth for each game. Because of this, most people chose Mario 3D World or Mario Kart, and the two other games didn't see much gameplay.

The Best Buy staff in charge of the stand were pretty well organized, making people write their names on a paper to have a clear order of passing, and timed the players so they could pass to the next ones.

I registered once to play Mario 3D World, then did the queue another time for Wind Waker, which would be 2 hours later because of so many people signing in between.

However while most of the people left after they signed, to come back when it was time for them to play, I sticked around because I counted on people not showing up and groups needing more players. It turned out to be a good strategy, and I ended up playing all games, and most levels. I could observe the others playing too.

Here's a breakdown per game:

**Super Mario 3D World:**

* Compared to NSMB, I felt there were several things changed to help casual players (yep, even more than NSMB): Bubbles from characters automatically move above other players, who only have to jump and barely aim to free them. The 1up counter is shared by all players, so that worse players are not forced to stop playing. Players who die come back in the Super form, instead of the small form. And finally, players have a shared pool of up to 4 stored items when someone who already has an item picks one up. I'm guessing that unless you really fuck up, you'll pretty much always have fire, racoon or cat.
* The cat suit: Pretty cool. You can climb walls, which seemed to be very useful in the levels available, even overpowered as you can skip a lot of the level. You can do a lunge attack that makes you travel diagonally downwards. It's kinda silly when you do it in a long diagonal corridor (beginning of the underground part of 1-1), it kinda feels like you're flying. The claw attack seemed like an improved version of the tail attack of the racoon suit. Very easy to use and kill everything, even bullet bills. If you touch the flag at any point, the cat will climb to the top and get a 1up, which feels a bit like cheating, especially given the point system (more on that later). Finally the ""meows"" are pretty cute :3.
* First level is basic mario level, showing off the cat suit. Quite a few 1ups and hidden coins by climbing walls. Not much else to say.
* Second level shows off the fire suit and the transparent pipes. I have to say this was my favorite level. While in a pipe, you cannot stop or go backwards, but you can choose which direction to take at intersections. The end of the level has a big section of transparent pipes where you need to collect keys while avoiding fuzzies. There is even a tube to go directly to the top fo the flag. Very fun.
* The third level had bullet bills and cat suit. You could use the cat suit with wall conveyors to go find secrets.
* The fourth level is the aquatic yoshi dinosaur. Everybody can control it and make it jump! Very chaotic! At some point there is a secret behind a waterfall, followed by a boost then a jump pad. Somebody thought the boost WAS the jump pad, and jumped while on it, making us fall to our doom. Pretty fun chaos.
* The final level is a boss battle against a snake king. For some reason the moving platform to go to the boss doesn't need all players on it to start moving. Players who are lagging behind will fall to their doom, which made us laugh every time. The boss itself isn't very difficult. The king snake is in the middle and must be jumped on three times. You need to use his minion snakes as platforms to get high enough to get him. If you have a cat suit (given at the beginning of the level, and even more given during the fight), you can even climb the snake minions and not have to wait for them to go down. The boss goes down fast. While the rest of the levels had a clear NSMB feel, this boss reminded me more of Mario Galaxy, especially the design.
* The score: Nintendo had a great idea to create a little competition between players based on score. After every level, the tally is made, and the winner is declared. No reward other than bragging rights in the demo. While I really liked the spirit of competition it created (akin to Four Swords), it was sometimes a bit unfair. The boss gave more points for the final blow, so the one doing that blow usually wins, regardless of the rest. The yoshi gives points equally to all players, so it only comes down to the flag at the end. Flag which by the way, give insane amount of points if you reach the top (10k), often doubling your total.
* Some details: Item blocks dont pop all 4 items at once like in NSMB, but need to be punched once per item, which makes it hard to steal another's item by mistake (you can still do it on purpose though, hehehe). Small blue toad has the mini mushroom colors (blue with white dots) while his fire form is orange with red dots. Small peach is a chibi version of herself (quite cute :o) while her fire form is a white dress with red ribbon. The small Mario and Luigi dont have caps. The 4th level with the aquatic yoshi dinosaur thing has [SMB64's rainbow ride music](http://youtu.be/JUJ_cr11PSY)! Also the death sound is [from smb3](http://youtu.be/OFX8-ctkQqY).
* Overall I liked it, but I wouldn't say it's a true successor of Mario Galaxy. I'm also worried that it might be even easier than the recent NSMBU, though it probably will have a few hard levels at the end as usual.

**Mario Kart 8:**

* The demo was limited to 2 players. The game still has 12 racers, and it kept the coins from MK7. The one most important thing I wanted to know is, with 12 players, how much does the first player get hit with, aka, is it as bad as MKWii. Unfortunately, it seems powerful items were turned off for the demo. The best item available for last players was the golden mushroom. The rest was just the regular items + spinning triple shells and fire flowers. Also Toadette and Koopa were there.
* You can play with a single Wiimote or the Wii U controller. I'm guessing the Nunchuk too, but I couldn't try. The Wii U controller screen shows items of all the other players, just like MK7's bottom screen. That's a HUGE advantage over the Wiimote. There is also a button on the screen to honk, another huuuuuge advantage :D. In addition, you can show the map, which has a little 3D effect. Even with this effect, some maps like the Mobius Strip are quite confusing to look at on a 2d plane.
* There were 3 tracks. The first track was the Mobius Strip, very basic first level, with a funny twist. The whole mobius thing is very beautiful, with upside down signs and even a castle, however it doesn't actually change much on a gameplay side. It also has a short aerial section over regular road which, just like on MK7, doesn't matter much.
* The second track is Toad's Town. We can see here that the ""driving on walls and ceilings"" can make maps quite interesting. Even in this simple track, there were several alternate paths that went on the walls, or over the main track. Pretty cool. Also there's a Peach Statue of Liberty in the background.
* The third track was the Boo Manor, without contest the best. However a lot of players weren't fast enough to reach it in time, so I didn't see it a lot. It has a lot of weird things with wavy walls, players driving at 90 degrees on both sides of the room, kinda like some tracks in FZero GX. My favorite part is when you are driving on a wall, towards the floor, and you enter a body of water in the mouth of a statue. It feels like you're going through a wall made of water. There is also an aerial section which is actually a little significant, as you can get coins and an alternate path.
* The anti-gravity gimmick is pretty good, but in an indirect way. I think it will make tracks much more complicated and interesting. However, while you are in anti-gravity, the gameplay doesn't change a bit. Just like underwater driving from MK7, it's seems to be almost purely a graphical gimmick. I noticed one thing, if you bump into another racer while in anti-gravity, both will spin around and lose a bit of speed.
* A positive point: The game is BEAUTIFUL. There are details everywhere during the tracks, and you can see the HD resolution flash at you. The lighting effects have been improved too. You can particularly see them while using a fire flower. Every fireball projects light all around it. And the game seemed to run at a smooth 60fps as promised, though it was only 2 players.

**Wind Waker HD:**

* As this was single player, not many people chose to play it. I couldn't see Outset Island entirely.
* You play with the Wii U Controller. A is rolling, B is sword, X Y and R are items. ZL or ZR is target locking. L does nothing I think. The controller screen has 3 tabs: Inventory, for quick reassignment of the items to your buttons, Map, which showed nothing in the demo (blank map), but will be for the World Map, and Bottles, which isn't for potions (that's inventory) but for the new Miiverse function (more on that later).
* You could run around on Outset Island, or fight against Helmarock King. I decided to go for the boss fight. The controls are very intuitive and I remembered everything immediately even after several years. I managed to beat the boss in 4 minute 30 sec, beating the previous record of the Best Buy :D. The demo ends after you enter Ganondorf's door.
* I used the rest of my time to check out Outset Island. I couldn't advance in the story, but I noticed they had added Tingle bottles on the shore. Picking these ups (no animations, just like picking up a rupee) would show Miiverse messages on the Wii U controller screen, in that Bottles tab. Including drawings and screenshots! For the demo, the messages were fake, but I thought the idea was cool.
* On a graphical side I wasn't impressed. Though it's obviously better than the original, the cartoony style makes it that it's not a huge visible upgrade between the two versions. The thing you notice the most is the added bloom in the distance, which is ok but doesn't feel much of an improvement. I even noticed some bad aliasing, so they could have done a bit more work on it in my opinion.

**Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze:**

* Nobody wanted to play this game! I was only able to play it once near the end. There are 4 levels but I could only see the first one and the minecart one.
* It's pretty much more DKCR. There's some neat camera effects during barrel sequences, and cool animations while you swim for exemple. There's also some impressive destruction effects, like when DK destroys a bunch of boats by slamming the ground, then flips the last one over using a barrel.
* I noticed players have 3 hearts right from the start instead of 2. Though hopefully that might be for the demo only.
* I think the game is gonna be good, but nothing revolutionary. Kinda like NSMBU. I wish Retro had chosen Metroid instead...

That's it. A lot of details for those who like that. All in all I don't regret spending almost 3 hours there. While waiting, a lot of people talked about SSB4 and their reaction to the Wii Fit trainer (some love, some hate). I got some sweet loot (Luigi coin, Luigi foam cap, Luigi racing flag, Animal Crossing 3DS sticker skin, 4 Animal crossing pins) and even something like 30 puzzle pieces from Streetpass :P
I might return Saturday to play with friends. I think there's gonna be even more people, but if you go early enough (I'd say over 15 mins before the start) you might be able to play right away. There probably isn't gonna be any loot though.

We reached 30,000 subscribers during the week so congratulations on that and let's keep growing!

#####**New rule**
* **We have decided to remove ALL images from now on.** We found that we weren't sure about which images promoted discussion and were allowed, and which images belonged on /r/casualnintendo which means you guys may have been confused too. This rule will hopefully clear this up.
* **HOWEVER**, you may submit self-posts that include images as long as you write about the image (e.g. why you posted it/what it contribute) and it provides room for discussion from the community.

----

####**Casual Saturdays**

* As of next Saturday (13th of July) we will be having Casual Saturdays. This is a day that anything can be posted (excluding hate speech, slurs, or bigotry) however, we may decide to include mandatory flairs so people are able to remove posts that they don't want to see.

* There will be a post sometime next week to confirm all the details regarding Casual Saturdays

----

######Reiterating some rules

* **Please try and link to the source.** We are aware that some sites essentially just copy another article and source that. Please try and link to that source as it is usually better written and contains more information

* **We do remove tech support questions.** Nintendo's tech-support is excellent. If you have any problem, you can send it off to them for free with no obligation to pay for a repair, and their service charges are very reasonable. If you do need help, /r/consolerepair is a better resource. In the same vain, Club Nintendo questions are all answered on the Club Nintendo website, and if you don't understand then emailing Nintendo will get you the help you need.

----
###One last thing

* If you do report a comment or submission, please message the mods with the link and the reason why you reported it. We can act quicker and it helps us understand why you have reported it.

----

That's all guys, happy gaming!

[x-post from /r/truezelda]",RashAttack,171,18,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1fep8z/four_swords_adventures_was_ahead_of_its_time_and/,"Hardly anyone has played FSA the way it was meant to be played; 4 players with the GBAs and link cables. I was lucky enough to be friends with a couple of Zelda fans, so we pooled together our resources (which was fucking difficult when we were 12 years old), and managed to enjoy the game in all its glory. 

I gotta say, it was ridiculously fun and I wouldn't be ashamed to call it one of the best Zelda games I have ever played. Sadly, the set up was fucking frustrating and many people were unable to enjoy it properly. 

I believe that the Wii U gives Nintendo the **PERFECT** opportunity to create a Four Swords experience that has the potential to reach a much wider audience. The technology today required for this to come to fruition is widespread. Think about these two options:

1. Four player local multiplayer utilising 4 Nintendo 3DS systems. 

2. Online multiplayer utilising the Wii U gamepad. 

Nintendo can even mix these around and make it more customisable in order for us customers to have the best opportunity of always playing the game the way it should be; with three other players. For example, one player can be on the gamepad, two other players on their 3DSs, and the 4th is playing over the Internet from his/her Wii U. If Nintendo were to add more advanced features like opening parties up to the public, allowing players to drop into other people parties akin to Diablo, then you are pretty much guaranteed to always be able to explore Hyrule as a group of 4.

The crucial point to note here is that the infrastructure and technology is all available to make this a reality. Whether or not Nintendo would go along with it may merely be a pipe-dream (for now at least). 

So what do you guys think? Can you see this happening and would you be excited for a FS game should Nintendo announce that they're developing one for the Wii U?",Quality Post,False,,t5_2qhnk,False,quality,,True,t3_1fep8z,http://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1fep8z/four_swords_adventures_was_ahead_of_its_time_and/,

There aren't any games I know of that are Japan-exlusive that I really care about, and the ones that I do care about I'm not going to want to play in Japanese, since I can't read the language. I'd be much more interested in petitioning publishers for an English localization then petitioning Nintendo to go region-free.

So what exactly is the fuss about region-free games that's gotten everyone so worked up?",,False,,t5_2qhnk,False,,,True,t3_1hkvpx,http://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1hkvpx/serious_question_why_should_i_care_about_region/,

There really isn't any new info here, as it was pretty much all revealed at E3. The big difference is: This presentation was focused on money. It was all about how to calm down investors and show that sales would happen. My friend told me that they actually said that they couldn't show their consumers this side of Nintendo that only cares about money.

Highlights:

* Wonderful 101 and Bayonetta 2 are Nintendo IPs (i.e. They belong to Nintendo and not Platinum)
* Possible cross platform play with new Smash Bros. They are looking into it.

Based on internal projections, Nintendo will sell $1.5 bullion in software in the US alone. We know who we are and we are proud. We lean towards innovation, not mimicking what others have. Explore ways to bring more people into the game and come out feeling happy. Positive reactions are the best tools to grow the industry. For millions of people, Nintendo will remain the first name in videogames. Nintendo is determined to drive category growth

I was *this* close to hopping in my car and driving there, when I figured I should at least call and check if they could ship it. Turns out they could! At least according to the woman I spoke with. All I had to do was call my local gamestop, have them call the store with it in stock, and then they'd get it shipped and call me when it was in. Sweet.

The store manager of my local gamestop turned out to be a complete doofus, though. He claimed he'd never heard of that process, but said he'd give it a shot. I told him what game it was, and I could just hear his attention pique. I was immediately suspicious of him. Especially when he tried to end our phone call briskly, saying ""Ok I'll give them a call and let you know when it's in.""

""...Umm, don't you need my name?""

""...oh yeah.""

""And my phone number?""

""....Yes.""

Well, fast forward a week and no phone call. I have to do some serious digging at this point to find out that someone called the store claiming to be me, told them not to ship it, and went in to pick the game up.

I was flabbergasted. Only two people even new I'd set this up, and both of them were managers... The first women I spoke to apologized, and said she must have gotten confused. So I ask ""But did this person claim to be me?""

""I got that impression...""

Did you get that impression because THEY LIED AND SAID THAT TO YOU?!?! She really kept skirting the answer.

There's nothing I can do about this, hell I can't even prove it. But I was so excited and now I'm so bummed. Just had to share.

TL;DR: I set up a store to store transfer of Xenoblade, only to find out that someone claiming to be me cancelled the transfer and bought the game in person. Only 2 other people new about the transfer and they were both store managers. Stings.

EDIT: Thanks everyone for lamenting with me. It's obvious this kind of thing has happened before. I've decided to pursue this matter with corporate after all. Not because I'm mad, but because I've brought to light some negative press for GameStop, and I think it's only fair to give them a chance to make it right and earn some positive press. I'll keep you posted.

1361035042.0,136,self.nintendo,18n7by,Four Easy Things Nintendo could do on the 3DS eShop to make it even more successful,KirbyEmoticon,159,23,99,http://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/18n7by/four_easy_things_nintendo_could_do_on_the_3ds/,"This is quite simply a little opinion post on some things Nintendo could do very easily on the eShop that would be successful. If this doesn't sound like your cup of tea, you might wanna turn back.


**1) Make sales Weekly**

Nintendo occasionally does sales on the eShop. Such as right now they're doing on. And these are great! It encourages people to buy the games, and people who were reluctant to drop $15 for a game can easily be more willing to drop $10 for it. However, these sales are only done occasionally. My question is why not every week? I'm not asking for like, something steam sized, but just once a week lower some random game a few bucks, and just watch it's sales go up. It's really simple, makes Nintendo look good in the eyes of gamers for doing sales all the time, and Nintendo gets extra cash. Everyone wins!


**2) Put DS games on the eShop**

The DS had a spectacular library! I don't think people would argue this fact. It had great RPGs, platformers, the list goes on. But, the DS is slowly beginning to fade away, but that doesn't mean the profits from it have to fade too. Simply put DS games on the eShop for say, $20-$30 for each one? I know there are plenty of DS games I haven't been able to play or find now that I wouldn't mind paying a digital copy for. It's the perfect way for Nintendo to continue to get profits from already successful games like Super Mario 64 DS, Kirby Super Star Ultra, and to give games that weren't so successful a second chance on the digital market, like Chibi-Robo Park Patrol. There is plenty of money still in the DS library, and Nintendo would be foolish not to tap it out.


**3) Put 3D Movies on the eShop**

Anyone remember E3 2010? Remember how Nintendo announced that they had planned with Warner Bros., Disney, and Dreamworks to release movies on the 3DS in 3D, such as How to Train your Dragon, and Tangled? What ever happened to that? And don't say that's what Netflix is, go watch the E3 videos yourself, there is no mention of Netflix, it's strictly Nintendo and these Movies companies. Whatever happened to this? The 3DS has a special place in the market for being one of the cheapest 3D devices out there. Thus, it could easily be a great place to release 3D movies on. Can you imagine just how exciting that would be to watch a movie in your own home in 3D? Nintendo can seriously take advantage of this odd monopoly over 3D movies, why have they not? Admittedly, this is probably the hardest thing on the list to achieve, but Nintendo themselves have said they already had made plans with the companies, how hard could it be to initiate those plans?


**4) Revive the first and second generations of Pokemon on the 3DS**

You might think ""Well gee, does Pokemon really warrant as an entire reason?"" Yes, it does. Whether you like the series or not, you can't deny that it's insanely popular. And having Pokemon Red/Blue/Yellow/Gold/Silver/Crystal on the eShop would sell like hotcakes. Heck, they could charge $10 for each game, and people would STILL buy it. Just as long as they had a decent emulator running them, so wireless trading and battling was possible, Gameboy Printer saved imaged to the 3DS Camera instead, etc. But why just stop there? Remake the Pokemon Pikachu pedometer as an app for the 3DS that still has functionality with the Gold/Silver/Crystal games, charge $4 for it, profit. Make a Pokemon Stadium 3DS App where you could do wi-Fi battles with Gen I/II battle mechanics online, trade, storage, etc. Maybe even transfer Pokemon to X/Y. Basically, Pokemon Stadium online and in 3D. Charge $15 for that, print money. This is a perfect way to not only make a ton of money, but also generate hype for X/Y.


Anyways, this is my opinion piece on what Nintendo could do on the eShop easily to generate plenty of revenue. I tried to avoid stating obvious reasons, like GBA games (I'd believe that if they're gonna be on the WiiU and if they've already made an emulator for it on the 3DS, they've probaby already planned on bring them to the 3DS.) And Miiverse accounts tied to purchases, and bring the Miiverse to the 3DS, which I believe they've already stated they plan on doing so in the future. What do you guys think? Do these reasons sound possible, or are they absurd?",,False,,t5_2qhnk,False,,,True,t3_18n7by,http://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/18n7by/four_easy_things_nintendo_could_do_on_the_3ds/,

1368651208.0,132,self.nintendo,1eennu,Nintendo Theme Park Ideas,jevmorgan,157,25,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1eennu/nintendo_theme_park_ideas/,"So I know that the idea of a Nintendo theme park has been [thrown around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6j2-mlPpi0) quite a bit, but I was thinking about how wonderful and amazing they could make it, and I just couldn't help but write some stuff down. I'm only writing down ideas for attractions, not restaurants or gift shops, as those are kind of a given that they would be in a park like this. Let me know what you guys think, and if there are any cool additions or suggestions that you would want if you were to build Nintendo Land!

**Mushroom Kingdom**

Of course, there's got to be a Mushroom Kingdom. It should be near the middle or the front of the park, as Mario is the central character that everybody knows. Here are the attractions that they should have there.

*Peach's Castle*

This is where the gigantic arcade facility would be. I would hope that they would have every Nintendo licensed arcade cabinet in existence there, along with pinball machines that are Nintendo themed (I have seen a Super Mario Bros. pinball machine in real life before, I know they exist already), and a bunch of Wii U systems or whatever other gaming system is the newest stuff so a bunch of people can play together. Lots of different systems with Mario Kart, Smash Bros., Star Fox, Goldeneye, etc.. They could have virtual reality games, too. Also, all the main doors would look like the giant paintings from Super Mario 64, and the rooms would be decorated to look like the worlds in the game.

**EDIT:** *Luigi's Mansion*

A classic haunted house where you get to run around and get scared by the ghosts. Maybe you also get a little flashlight at the beginning that lets you scare the ghosts away yourself, too!

Thanks, /u/gamergrl1018 and /u/samueldlockhart for reminding me that we must include my favorite plumber, Luigi!

*Mario Kart (Double Dash Battle Mode)*

These are basically bumper cars. I think probably the best way to do this is to have it kind of like the Buzz Lightyear bumper cars in the Disney arcade at Disney World in Florida. In that, you have one person driving, and they roll over items (in the Buzz thing, it's cannonballs) and another shooting ball things from a cannon at other cars. When the balls hit certain spots on the car, the bumper car spins out for a few seconds. Of course, you would have to have different items than just balls. We want turtle shells! Most points wins.

*World 1-1*

This is an obstacle course that's designed to give you the real platforming experience of Super Mario Bros. It's basically a real-live version of World 1-1 from Super Mario Bros., where you run around and jump on blocks, smush Goombas, and kick Koopa shells. A few people can go at a time, like maybe four. You all wear hats (Mario, Luigi, Wario, Waluigi) because that's fun.

*World 8-4*

This is a show at the end of the night where Mario battles Bowser. It’s a pyrotechnic spectacular.

**Hyrule**

*Link's Archery Practice*

Yeah, it's the least popular game out of all of them (other than the CD-i games, *but we don't talk about them*), but it would be a good attraction. They mention this in the video, and it would be fun. 

*Wind Waker Sailing Game*

This is a boat simulator thing. They have something similar to what I'm thinking at Disney World, but it's a Pirates of the Caribean thing. This is a boat deck that moves around like there are actual waves of water beneath you. You and a few friends are the crew of a pirate ship in the world of New Hyrule, trying to help Link get past Ganon's defenses in his tower. You have one person steering, and the others are all shooting cannons. There are projections on a panoramic screen all around you showing you how Link is doing (you can see him sailing the King of Red Lions nearby), and you are trying to shoot projected images of baddies and other cannon ships all around you. If Link gets inside Ganon’s fortress, you win.

**EDIT:** *Bombchu Bowling Alley*

I love this idea, you get to somehow do bombchu bowling like in OoT! I'd like to see it look like the original one in the game, but I don't know exactly how to set it up. Thanks, /u/samueldlockhart

*Power, Wisdom, or Courage?*

This is just a little bitty side thing where you answer some questions and you are assigned a piece of the Triforce, depending on your answers. It’s a video touchscreen thingy, and you can get a fun stamp on the back of your hand, showing which piece you got.

*Triforce Pieces Search*

This is a little game to be played all over the park. You have a little card thing you carry around the park, and there are certain locations where you can hold up your card and you will find a piece of the Triforce. There are 8 in total all over the park. When you get them all, you can get some sort of special prize from a gift shop or something. Or you can do this with an app on your 3DS, too!

**Pokemon**

*Safari Zone*

You are given 3 pokeballs and go into a room where you can walk around a little bit. The room is basically a panoramic display of the Safari Zone from the games. Pretty soon, a pokemon appears from the tall grass, and you attempt to catch it. You can still throw mud or bait, too (they’re located just on the floor in the room when you get in there). Of course, you are totally going to end up catching a pokemon every time, but it might take all three balls to do it. The pokemon that appears will be somewhat random, much like the real Safari Zones in the games. Once you actually capture the pokemon, you are given an AR card with that pokemon’s details on it. You can use this AR card not only to look at your pokemon through your 3DS AR reader, but also, it can be imported into your copy of your real pokemon game (I’m guessing X and Y), and you can use and train it as you would a regular pokemon that you caught in-game! You can also buy a plushie of your pokemon in the gift shop and you can also get little accessories to decorate it (like bows and stuff).

*Pokemon Gym*

You can take that same card that you won in the Safari Zone and go to the Pokemon Gym. You scan the card when you go in the room, and you have a real live pokemon battle against a gym leader (chosen based on the type of pokemon you have in your card so that you’re not super weak against it). 

*HM 02 (Fly) Ride*

This is just a roller coaster where you get to ride on the back of a pokemon all over a miniaturized version of Kanto or whatever the most current region of pokemon there is. Nothing really special, but you gotta have some roller coasters.

**EDIT** *Pokemon SNAP!*

This is a boat ride where you can use your 3DS or your regular camera to take photos along the ride of pokemon or scenery. If you use your 3DS, then you might be able to get a little reward or something for each pokemon you capture, like extra play coins, I dunno. Daily, weekly and all time high scores posted as well as being able to purchase your photos. Thanks, /u/p0rtugalvii!

**Donkey Kong Country**

*Mine Cart Carnage*

This is, of course, a mine cart roller coaster. Also, there is an animatronic Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong in the front of the cart.

*Donkey Kong Jungle Beat Show*

You need some sort of musical show in a park like this, so a bongo-filled show would be good. You could also have real apes or chimps doing stuff in the show. I don’t know what it’d be about, but it could be pretty fun. Also, just outside the show, there’s an area with lots of drums and bongos and stuff where kids can beat the drums to their hearts content.

**Star Fox**

*Do a Barrel Roll!*

I like the idea for the roller coaster that they show in that video that I linked to earlier. I wouldn’t change a thing. 

*Landmasters Vs. Arwings*

This is a little remote controlled attraction where you have fairly big (I mean like maybe 2 feet tall) Landmasters fighting against the Arwings (also pretty big, but they’d have to be on wires or something to make it work). It’d be like remote control laser tag, and you can have up to about 6-8 people playing at a time. Whichever team tags the other the most wins.

**Metroid**

*Samus’ Gunship* 

This is basically a slower ride thing where you’re in a cockpit and you shoot at stuff all around you, trying to hit as many space pirates as you can along the way. You have 4 people in the cockpit so you can all compete, and there’s always someone on every side of the thing.

*Morph Ball...Something?*

I’m really not sure what else to do with Metroid, but I know something can be done with the Morph Ball concept.

**EDIT:** *Metroid Arm Cannon Tag*

How about a Metroid maze, but turn it into a laser-tag game! Everybody can have arm cannons that shoot lasers to tag opponents on the other team! You could also pick up ""power ups"" like missiles or power bombs. Thanks, /u/OhGad!

**Kirby’s Dream Land**

This is kind of an area for little kids. Cream puff stuff.

Stuff like a merry go-round where you can ride creatures from Kirby games. Not much else to say about it. Other little kid rides could be included in the area, not sure what they would be.

*Gift shop idea:* You can sell lots of hats like Kirby wears in the games to show his abilities.

**EDIT:** **Animal Crossing Village**

I honestly have never played Animal crossing, but I think it deserves a spot, of course! 

*Tom's Nook*

An Animal Crossing Village where you can walk around, go into houses, meet familiar faces (similar to the mascots at Disney) and do interactive things like fish or something. And oh yeah, the train from Nintendo Land needs to be able to transport in that. Thanks, /u/Blizblob-The-Great!

*Log Flume*

This would be a log flume where you ride in a water type.

*Animal Crossing Lazy River*

It takes you through a river, while playing the game's music, with animatronic villagers. Thanks, /u/Ninjastar1234!

**Misc. Nintendo Franchises**

I wouldn’t want to dedicate an entire section of the park to Kid Icarus or F-Zero, but there definitely need to be some rides for these. They can be kind of scattered around the park, between the bigger sections (like between Donkey Kong Country and Hyrule, you could have the Kid Icarus ride).

*Kid Icarus*

You fly along with Pit on a rollercoaster adventure to defeat baddies. 

*F-Zero*

REALLY FAST roller coaster. NOT for little kids. It has lots of loops, tons of g-force, and it really goes fast. Definitely needs to have a corkscrew in there, too.

*Punch Out!*

Giant poofy fist fighting, Nobody really gets hurt, but it’s basically like a bounce house where you put on some giant Hulk hands-like things and bop each other with them.

*Pilot Wings* 

Another fun roller coaster. Lots of dog fighting moves, some big dips and stuff.

**EDIT:** *Pikmin*

Pikmin would be a perfect rest stop. A park in the middle of the theme park with a Pikmin theme for people to sit down and eat their meals. Green grass, flower, nature, and props from the game. Those huge huge bottle caps would be perfect for tables and seats. In the trees they could plant the tiny clay figurines that they use for the game ads. Thanks, /u/PrivCaboose!

**EDIT:** *Wave Race*

These are bumper boats, designed to look much like the wave racers. Thanks for the suggestion, /u/samueldlockhart

Okay, this turned out to be MUCH, MUCH longer than I thought it would. But I would really like some feedback from you guys! What do you think? What would you add or take away?


**EDIT:** Wow, there are some good ideas in these comments! I'm going to add my favorites in the mix up in the top. Thanks for your feedback!

[If you missed it, you can catch the spoiler-free recording start to finish here.](http://www.twitch.tv/srkevo1/b/430438070?t=3h13m37s)**

Please put spoiler tags on any discussion of the winner!

---

---

---

Day 3 of the largest Super Smash Bros. tournament of all time, we've started with 696 entrants and are now down to just 8 players left. Top 8 through Grand Finals of Melee is scheduled to begin at 12 PM Pacific Time (or whenever King of Fighters XIII ends, Tournament Standard Time as we call it since you never know what's gonna run late). Hype has been building all weekend with a ton of dramatic upsets, and expect finals to get even more hectic!

###**Bracket**

This is a double elimination format, meaning players aren't eliminated until they lose twice. Everyone started in winner's bracket, and losing once moves them down to loser's bracket. When one player is left in each bracket, they play each other in Grand Finals. The player coming from winner's side only has to win one set to eliminate their opponent and win the tournament, whereas the player from loser's would have to win two. Additionally, those getting sent to loser's bracket early have to play twice as many matches since the bracket keeps getting repopulated with people falling down from winner's. But it's not unheard of for people to survive the loser's gauntlet and come back to take the tournament, so don't write them off yet!

**Winner's bracket**  

* Hungrybox (Jigglypuff)
* Mew2King (Sheik/Marth) EDIT: Or Fox, apparently. I know he's had a pocket Fox secondary, but I haven't seen him use it in tournament very often and was not expecting to see secondaries in such an intense bracket. Then again, I haven't seen him face Hungrybox in a while either, so I guess he just felt his Fox was a better matchup against Jiggs.
* Dr. PP (Falco)  
* Wobbles (Ice Climbers)  

**Loser's bracket**  

* Mango (Fox)  
* Armada (Peach)  
* Ice (Sheik)  
* Shroomed (Dr.Mario)

Worth noting that Armada has been the undisputed world champion and hasn't lost a single set in over 2 years... *until yesterday*. Anything can happen now after an upset like that, there is no sure bet!

###**Yesterday's highlights**

For anyone who was watching other games yesterday and wondering why you kept hearing so much screaming coming from the Melee booth, here's recordings of the three most ridiculous matches we saw:

* [Dr. PP vs Armada](http://www.twitch.tv/srkevo3/b/429937078?t=2h50m22s)  
* [Mango vs Wobbles](http://www.twitch.tv/srkevo3/b/429937078?t=4h30m46s)  
* [Axe vs Mango](http://www.twitch.tv/srkevo3/b/429937078?t=3h48m00s)

Thanks to [classicalmusician](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fighters/comments/1i9fnl/missed_2nd_day_melee_heres_three_sets_showing/) for finding the exact timestamps of each set in Twitch's VOD.

###**Where to watch**

The stream will be at **http://www.twitch.tv/srkevo1**. I hope plenty of you tune in because it's going to be an awesome show!

They're also setting up for King of Fighters XIII right as I type this if you're interested in watching that too. After Melee will be a special trailer for a new DLC character in Injustice: Gods Among Us, then the Injustice finals, a demonstration of the upcoming Killer Instinct game, then Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, followed by a trailer for the next iteration of Street Fighter 4, ending with the finals for Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition v2012.

* According to the US Nintendo site, the WiiU Direct will be about 35 minutes long

* It appears Nintendo didn't factor in Daylight Savings time when telling the Australians when it starts, so I have to wait another hour.

* We **will** be getting release information for some games and there appears to be online multiplayer in some of the games being shown. [SOURCE](http://i.imgur.com/Zqs8Ilw.png)

* **Miiverse**. Showing people how to improve your experience on it. Miiverse characters with green ticks have been verified by Nintendo (Ex: Developers) and they can post links and embedded Youtube videos in their posts.

* **Two upgrades** coming in Spring and Summer (Northern Hemisphere seasons). Improve software launch times and load times.

* **VC coming after the spring system update!!** The lineup cannot be confirmed right now. NES and SNES are coming and games are being developed for the Wii U system! Gameboy Advance games also. People who have already bought a VC game on the Wii get a discounted prices on the new VC games which seems fair. They are playable on the TV and gamepad and interact with the Miiverse too.

* Not entirely sure about this discount price thingo. Looks good though. (30 year anniversary for something, so some games on the Eshop are 30c I think).

* **Miiverse** users can create communities, more than one official community per title, improve usability, add a filter function, and more to come (probably announced at E3) MIIVERSE COMING TO SMARTPHONES IN SPRING! (Browser only, but an app will be developed)

* **Games incoming!** Only a few titles released by Nintendo for WiiU in Jan/Feb because Nintendo want to improve gameplay rather than rush release.

* **The Wonderful 101** (game) with new footage. Appears to be a game similar to Star Fox 64. Looks pretty fun!

* **Bayonetta 2**- Not the right timing to discuss details about it. Video included though and the devs appear to be putting a lot into the game.

* **Smash Bros. Game** - May see it at 2013's E3

* **New titles** Mario Kart, a 3D Mario game (We will see both being played at E3), WiiU party, Yoshi's Epic Yarn, new unknown game (Fire Emblem meets Shin Megami Tensei)

* **Legend of Zelda news** no visuals yet, just talk about development (need time), rethinking conventions of Zelda (dungeons in order, play by yourself), talking about converting Zelda titles into HD (Showing Wind Waker)

* **Wind Waker** coming in fall/autumn. Upgrade graphics, playable on TV and on gamepad, can use Miiverse with it too [Screenshots](http://imgur.com/a/PJMdo)(Thanks /u/mylescox)

* **New Xenoblade!**

* Seperate opportunity to talk about 3DS

So that was pretty damn awesome! The games look amazing, the devs seem to be putting everything into the games, I'm happy with the new VC, The Wonderful 101 game looks pretty fun to play, and it's bright times ahead for Nintendo!",,False,,t5_2qhnk,1358953344.0,,colorzelda,True,t3_1744y5,http://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1744y5/wiiu_direct_discussion_thread/,

I have never really played zelda, and when I did play the first couple parts of twilight princess (I think I stopped once I got to the twilight castle town for the first time or something) I was pretty bad at it. I feel like OoT would be the same story, and even if I was better, that the game would be dated and only really fun for nostalgia if you played it before. Am I correct, or is there some underlying gold in OoT?

EDIT: This was just a simple question, and somehow blew up to the 2nd spot on this sub. Thx for that. I already bought OoT a while ago after the first ~10 comments (didn't realize this thread would go on for so long) and I'm currently In Hyrule fields on the way to the castle for the first time. I am glad I got the game, it does hold up quite well, and I can tell that later on, with the way they use the mechanics in fun ways for the puzzles (for me a big point of interest was the spider web hole in the middle of the great deku tree), that this game deserved most of the hype it got from you guys.

First off I want to clarify, it actually turned into 205 turns, because one guy thought it would be funny to use the Wacky Watch on the ""last"" turn of Mario Party 3.

Secondly, I want to thank everyone here for upvoting the post and helping out so much! With your help, we managed to raise $230, which is a bit higher than what we were hoping to accomplish. 100% of all of that is going to the St. Baldricks foundation!

In case you missed it, or still want to donate, the full marathon should pop up on my YouTube channel at about 3pm (EST) tomorrow (2/26), which can be found at:

http://www.youtube.com/GamersCast

We do these marathons for charity every few months and we're hoping our next one will be even bigger and better, so if you want to know when the next one will be you can follow me on [Twitch TV](http://www.twitch.tv/gamerscast). I'll also announce it on my YouTube channel.

Thanks again, Reddit!

My idea would be to add NintendoLand DLC not as purchases through the eShop but as addons bundles with other games. So If I buy Mario 3D World or MK8 I get a code to unlock more NintendoLand content (related to the bundle game). Every major WiiU release (including third parties and the more public facing indies) could be invited to join in. Buy Sonic: Lost World and get a four player version of the Sonic 2 special zone for NintendoLand.... 

It adds an incentive to purchase more software, lets devs add multiplayer content to their game without directly having to figure that out (am I crazy to assume most WiiU owners have NintendoLand?) and lets Nintendo sell DLC to those who buy second hand/rent a game.

It appears that the American stream will have both WiiU and 3DS news/games whereas the European stream will only focus on 3DS news/games. If I am to live update this post, it will be with the European stream. If anyone feels like it, they can live blog the American stream.

I'm going to update with the European news about the 3DS but only the main points. If I get time, or if someone else does it, I can update here with the American news at a later time.

1373468384.0,99,self.nintendo,1i0dyb,Miyamoto has said he's struggling to come up with new ideas for F-Zero.

I find this interesting. Obviously, Nintendo *could* just make a few new GP cups with HD graphics, throw in all the classic characters and tunes, and call it a day. They don't seem to be content with that, though, so my question for you is, what would you do to spice up the series?

For me, since Mario Kart seems to be borrowing some mechanics from F-Zero, I'd turn that around and borrow from Mario Kart. I'd love to see classic F-Zero tracks brough back for throwback GPs. In some ways, that's not a ""new"" idea, per se, but let's be honest, it still adds a new layer of content.

Additionally, I'd like to see the return of story mode, but perhaps focusing on more characters than just Falcon. I'm sure we all want to see as much Captain Falcon as possible, but with 30+ characters, I wouldn't mind more of them being fleshed out some more, especially the original four racers.

It works with three or four players, anything under gets a little boring. Each player starts at mario, and when you win a match you move to the character on the right. Whoever makes it to the last character wins, although after a few hours we usually only make it 2/3 of the way, and just let the lead win. We usually play with basic rules; 2 or 3 stock, low items or no items depending on who is playing. Sometimes well play with ""advanced"" rules, where the loser picks the stage, and can choose one of three options every round (1.edit the item settings. 2.raise or lower a player handicap by 10% including themselves. 3.

1368401592.0,100,self.nintendo,1e7m2b,"9 years later, I returned to and beat Paper Mario: TTYD. I wanted to get some of your thoughts on this game! [spoilers]",yurtyybomb,110,10,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1e7m2b/9_years_later_i_returned_to_and_beat_paper_mario/,"9 years ago I got to the shadow queen but couldn't beat her. I used to play RPGs and avoid a lot of enemies, so by that time I was severely underleveled, and I had used all of my items on the bosses before the shadow queen.

It took me 3 tries, but on the 3rd one I beat the game. I have a number of things I was impressed by and frustrated by with this game. I'll start with the good:

**GOOD:**

* Characters, characters characters

This game has, to date, probably the best cast of characters in any mario game. This is what made me fall in love with Paper Mario as a kid, and 9 years alter they still hold up well. I can't tell you how sad I felt when Mario and Peach were leaving on their boat to go back to their kingdom... and how glad I was when, after the credits, I was able to return to them post-shadow queen fight. I felt particularly bad for Vivian, who has no one (really) except for Mario, and who is still stuck with her horrible sisters after the game ends.

Character moments were many and great, too. Bobbery's wife. Koops gaining his courage. Goombella using her energy and youth to become more learned. Yoshi looking up to you and learning from your toughness. Ms. Mowz is an optional character, but I still enjoyed her badge-ninja ways. Flurrie (IMO) was a bit of a weak point and did not fit with the other cast of characters, though.

* Emotional, funny

The ending was amazing. Perfect for the tone and style of the game - funny, but ultimately meaningful.

* The levels

Glitzville.

I remembered it being awesome, and when I returned to it? Just as awesome, if not better because it's aged like a fine wine. What an amazingly crafted level. Fun, creative, and it has suspense and mystery. It outshined the rest of the game's levels by quite a bit IMO.

The other levels were also great, the Excess express comes to mind, but man. Glitzville. They were all unique in their appearance, but I have some complaints with them that I'll get to.

* Battle system

It's still awesome. It's varied, the enemies are all different and require different timings/tactics. It's interactive. 

* Graphics

The game has aged very well. I love games with distinct art styles because they are pretty timeless. In many ways, TTYD's mechanics haven't aged as well.. However.........

**BAD:**

Let me stress this next bullet point......

* Backtracking

THE BACKTRACKING. TTYD would, for me, be an absolute achievement and instant classic if only it just removed the painful and all too frequent episodes of backtracking. 

Tracking down General White and Goldbob. Coming back from Keelhaul Key.... then having to go immediately back to find Frankie and Francesca... then having to go into the jungle to find their wedding ring. On Keelhaul Key, getting to the end of the jungle, then having to run back, then finding Bobbery is hurt, then having to run back so Flavio gives you the Cola... then running back. TWILIGHT TOWN.... started so great, then you backtrack an insane, unhealthy amount of times. 

Glitzville shined because it had no backtracking. It had a completely unique level structure where it was, literally, a pretty smallish hub that progressed you as simply as moving you to the next locker room, which looked cooler. And yet, it was 10x better than any other level... the characters in the locker room (King K!!!) were incredible. 

I can't tell whether the level designers felt their game was just too short without the backtracking, but man... I could cite even more than that. I really could. But the point is that it all too frequently ruined great momentum and, IMO, detracts from this game's status as a classic. This would be an indisputable classic without the backtracking. I frequently forgot this was a game from 2004 until.... yeah.

What difference does it make if Nintendo doesn't go to E3? What if E3 stopped being the spectacle we make it out to be? Does it really matter? Sure some of you may argue that a big part of the Wii U's success this year depends on consumer awareness, and E3 plays a big role in that. I disagree, as long as we receive the information then that's it, we know about the games and life goes on.

Maybe I'm ranting. I've been saying for years that E3 is fun, but generally useless to the common consumer. Hell even as a fan I don't get much out of the actual conferences that I couldn't get watching some gameplay videos.

We need to go back to letting these companies operate as they see fit, and judging their moves based on the final product: the games.

Once he decided it was time to sleep, I wanted to keep playing, and was surprised that I had all the abilities he had as far as creating and joining groups.

I stayed up for another hour or so after he shut his game off creating groups and joining other online players, all without actually owning a copy of the the game.

It is the only controller on which I've been able to easily push 3 buttons at once (a+b+y, or a+y+x). Having your thumb in a central location made it muuuuch easier to find the other buttons in the heat of battle. I think a great innovation died with the GC controller.

Why do you think Nintendo dropped that button layout for the Wii/Wii U controllers? Cross-platform game compatibility?  Am I alone in thinking it was an improvement over the SNES style parallelogram layout?

Here is an image of the controller for reference:

To my [pleasant] surprise, the community here was extremely responsive and actually helped us achieve our goal of $750. Considering that it was not exactly a charity, this is amazing.

I've done many, many marathons in the past for actual charities and I've asked for help on many other subreddits. This is the only subreddit that I actually have gotten any sort of tangible support on, and you, /r/nintendo, should receive some sort of praise for that.

I know in the future that when I run a marathon for an actual charity (with Nintendo games, of course) that I will come back here in the future.

I hope you were mildly entertained watching our sanity slip away. Again, thank you for all that you have done.

Kazumi Totaka (a.k.a., Totakeke) details his throught process in [Nintendo Dream Vol. 182, ""Animal Crossing: City Folk Sound CD Interview.""](http://dic.nicovideo.jp/a/%E3%83%96%E3%83%AB%E3%83%BC%E3%81%8A%E3%81%AB%E3%81%8E%E3%82%8A) He describes being up all night, generally working himself to a stupor in the final days of Animal Crossing development, before the deadline to finish it. In the 5 minutes that he was walking from the nearest train station to his work, he mindlessly thought, ""Blue onigiri... That'd be sad, man..."" And just then, he finished the entirety of the song in his head. Onigiri has an image of playfulness, picnics, and youth in Japan, just like peanut butter and jelly might have in America. The thought of looking down at you onigiri and seeing that it was blue was sad, and it made sense to him at the time (he was sleep deprived and kind of zombie-esque). Some people think of ""Blue Onigiri"" as being an onigiri covered with blue mold, and how sad that would be--that would be an alternative interpretation of the song, but really the song's name and melody were thought up while staring into space, as described.

I contacted them and problem fixed.  Now I get an email telling me the same thing, 2 minutes later I get an email saying order canceled.

The first email I get telling me to contact them came at 7:39 A.M. the second email telling me they canceled my order comes at 7:41 A.M.

I called the number given to me in the first email I received and was told they couldn't help me.  I asked to talk to a supervisor, not because the first person was being rude or anything, just to see if someone higher up could help me.  Waited on hold for about 30 minutes and the lady finally told me she's having trouble transferring me and if they could have a number to call me on.

Gave them my number and got a phone call right away, the supervisor was also unable to fix my problem, she told me to contract corporate but told me she didn't have the number to give me and that I should google it.

I did that and corporate transferred me to online billing.  This lady was extremely rude and kept interrupting me.  She told me to call back and talk to sales and I asked her ""Would sales be able to help me with this?""  And she said ""No.""  So I attempted to ask ""Why would I call sales if you're telling me they're also not able to help?""  She didn't have a reasonable answer, and when I asked to talk to her supervisor I was hung up on.

I called corporate once again and spoke to a real nice lady who tried best to help me, at this point I was running out the door to go to work, she wanted to put me on hold but I explained to her that I was going into work and wouldn't be able to talk much longer.  She left a voicemail offering me a $50 gift card but told me I would not be able to get my Wii U pre order.

One thing I want to say about best buy, I've read that other places only charge 10% until you actually go to pick up the system.  Not best buy, they've been charging my debit card what seems like every few days  $370 to my card.  I made the mistake of renewing my license online last night and that cost me $75, and since in the weeks past best buy was making the charge on Wednesday I assumed I would be good.  

The $50 gift card doesn't really help me if I'm going to have to wait a year to get a Wii U.  I was laid off last Christmas and I really didn't get to get my son the things I wanted to get him.  He still had a good Christmas I just wish I could have done more.  This year I thought was going to be the perfect Christmas for my son and now it's not looking like it is going to be.

If anyone here can help this go viral, maybe we can force best buy to do the right thing and honor my order.  They've successfully charged my card week after week since September 14th when I placed the order, I don't think it was right of them to cancel my order without giving me time to rectify the situation.

UPDATE:

Target came through for me, went to the nearest Target and they didn't have any in stock, one of the employees looked on her little computer scanner thing and saw they had some in stock at 2 nearby stores.  I asked if she could have one of the stores set one aside for me.  She called up the store and they set one aside for me.  I just got home and am so relieved.  I don't know if the $50 gift card best buy is offering me is worth all the stress they put me through.  Thanks for all the suggestions to try out target, if I didn't read your suggestions I'd be scrambling on launch day to get one.

Nintendo knew that we were worrying and upset, and they answered., BIG TIME. Everytime Iwata apologized, I smiled an forgave him. The president of this company talks to us enough for me to feel like hes a friend of mine, let that sink in. They basically announced that we can look forward to E3, since we can look forward to the titles they announced and many more. By June, this system is going to be unbeatable. 

Now my opinions. 

The fact that they made Wind Waker HD is fucking incredible. The whole ditching the conventions of Zelda made me worried. I'm positive it will be great, but I feel like Zelda is going to get the Mario treatment and make it all retro. It's not bad, but what's a Zelda without thick plot? I cannot wait for 3D Mario and Mario Kart of course. I'm not a huge fan of JRPGs, but that Xenoblade-sequel game looks awesome. The Yoshi game literally looks like Yoshis Epic Yarn, disaapointed. I'm not a fan of the Fire Emblem series, but I'm sure the fans will love it. Wonderful 101 looks very fun. And I can't wait for the new virtual console. GBA GAMES!!!

Those are my thoughts. I fucking love Nintendo.",,False,,t5_2qhnk,False,,basicmario,True,t3_174wbt,http://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/174wbt/todays_direct_is_a_prime_example_of_why_i_love/,

So I got to thinking, ""why don't we have this""? So here are the reasons I think we need a GameCube Controller for Wii U, personally nicknamed Wii U Ret(P)ro Controller.


The Design Is More Original:

I really hate the fact that the WiiUPC looks exactly like a Xbox controller, but with the right side's analog stick and buttons switched. The GC Controller was immediately recognizable and knew it was from Nintendo, but the design and comfort was just as good. So I see no reason why the design had to change.


Fix Problems with the Original Pro Controller:

There are multiple problems with the Wii U Pro Controller, such as no mic jack, no octogonal analog slots, digital triggers, and what not. Which 2 of the 3 are already fixed if they go straight to the old design.


Backwards Compatibility For Wii:

There are two complaints I heard from others. One, does no support backwards compatibility for Wii. Two, no GameCube ports. They could hit two birds with one stone if they made the GameCube controller for the Wii U backwards compatible.

What do you think, do you agree? Please add your own reasons.",,False,,t5_2qhnk,False,,basicmario,True,t3_1603qd,http://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1603qd/3_reasons_i_think_we_need_a_gamecube_controller/,

Why do we care about certain things that never used to matter?,kilometersdavis12,83,11,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/zud52/what_happened_to_gamers_why_do_we_care_about/,"There's such a concern now about sales. I'm pretty sure most gamers aren't invested in gaming companies. If the Wii U doesn't shatter records or has a poor launch, who cares as long as the games that do come out are great. Conker's Bad Fur Day didn't sell very well but it's a very popular game nontheless. I feel many people (I'm guilty as well) think they work for IGN and what they say is law. It's especially alienating as a Nintendo fan having people who haven't played since the N64 tell me these games suck and the graphics suck and I'm a casual player, etc. I've had friends and strangers insult me for liking Wii games when most of them literally played Wii Sports for 5 minutes without trying Skyward Sword, Galaxy, DKCR, Epic Yarn. I don't harass people who play cookie cutter FPS games released very often but I could.

I like games to look nice just as much as anyone but to say that graphics define a game shouldn't be the case. Many times has it been stated that it's impossible to please gamers these days. If the price is low (Wii) it's cheap and for kids. If the price is expensive (PS3) it's not worth it. The main point I'm getting at is that I wish everyone could play the games they like without people who don't like a game/company to beat you down with insults and nonsense. I've been playing games a lot longer than many of those people and it's insulting.

EDIT: Glad we could talk about this peacefully. I didn't want this to be a Nintendo pity party or a Nintendo worship party so I'm glad that didn't happen either. I know Nintendo has huge flaws and I could've substituted Nintendo with another company but I'm more familiar with Nintendo. Main point is that I wish more gamers could enjoy playing games and having conversations about games without getting caught up in hardware and business so often.

1330148380.0,68,self.nintendo,q55n1,Announcement - New Subreddit Rules Trial,samueldlockhart,82,14,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/q55n1/announcement_new_subreddit_rules_trial/,"This is a self-post. Please upvote so that other users can see - I receive no karma for this post.

As r/nintendo grows, it's time to revise our rules. We've never really had any on this community before, but while this community is still small it's important to decide together what direction we're going to go in.

I'm proposing the following changes. Please comment on whether or not you agree, or anything I'm missing:

---

**Please, where known, link to the news source**

Reddit is a news aggregate site. Linking to another news aggregate site defeats the point of making this one. Sites such as Joystiq always provide a source for their story, so, if you know what that source is then link to that instead.

I know some of our submitters are submitting their own websites on r/Nintendo and that we're providing traffic for them. I've nothing against that, but please keep those submissions to reviews, editorials, commentary, etc.

---

**Don't submit text on pre-existing images**

Basically, no memes. This is where I expect a lot of disagreement, seeing as memes are our most upvoted submissions.

Memes kill conversation, turning opinions into jokes. Then when someone comments with a different viewpoint to the meme, they're ""missing the joke"" and get downvoted. They're not helpful to the purpose of this subreddit, or the goal for community.

But if you create an original comic (not ragefaces) that has a meme punchline, I'm not against that so much. Hence the awkwardly worded rule. What do you think, r/Nintendo?

---

Lastly, **please credit original artists when submitting comics/fanart**

We already do this well, but it's nice to state it outright. Link to the page on the website where the creator originally uploaded his art. Don't link directly to the image file, don't rehost on an imgur or similar sites.

1370422384.0,69,self.nintendo,1fpm1y,With WiiConnect24 ending on the 28th... anyone need MP3 Friend Vouchers?,miserablesecret,78,9,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1fpm1y/with_wiiconnect24_ending_on_the_28th_anyone_need/,"On June 28th, WiiConnect24 will no longer work, and messages cannot be sent between Wiis. This means that games which rely on WiiConnect24 for additional functionality will lose these features.

For games like Smash Bros Brawl it's no big deal, but there's one specific game that will be gimped as a result: **Metroid Prime 3: Corruption**. In order to unlock all of the gallery items, you need *15 Friend Credits*, which are earned  by receiving *Friend Vouchers* from other Metroid Prime 3 players. So after the 28th, you will no longer be able to earn Friend Vouchers, thus preventing the ability to legitimately earn the last of the gallery items.

I figured I'd start a little initiative to get people trading these things to help people unlock all the gallery items before the ability is lost.

In order to do this, all you need is to add my Wii System Code to your Address Book in the Wii Menu, and share yours (in this thread or via PM) with the person(s) you add. After a little bit of time, you will be able to start MP3 and give vouchers to people in your Address Book who also have the game. You and the other person may need to each boot the game once to complete this process (I'm not sure).

I know MP3's an old game, but some people like me haven't gotten all of the gallery unlockables yet. I already have my 15 Friend Credits (from 2007 when the game was fresh), so I want to help others get theirs, too. Any takers?

My Wii System Code is `7274-3640-1041-7717`. I currently have `15` vouchers to give to people, but hopefully this will inspire other people who own the game to give out vouchers, too. I may end up with more vouchers as I continue through Veteran and Hypermode difficulties.

**EDIT:** I'm not sure if Metroid Prime 3 and Trilogy can exchange friend vouchers, but I'm willing to give it a shot! I've also read that you must be in the same region as the person you're trading with, making things a bit more complicated... I'm in the US and so I can only trade with NA players.

Some redditors have asked for a source as proof that this is happening, and what exactly is being turned off. As per [a message I received on my Wii June 4th](http://imgur.com/tlECHVw,LG1QzJK,aMt1XCj,P1mHwJG,h1tXCpe,tdHd5ZO,IzU0p0f), only a select handful of Nintendo's online services are being discontinued. Online gameplay such as Smash Bros Brawl, Mario Kart Wii, etc are assumed to still work after the 28th.

Anyone else notice this? I miss the games like the old Paper Mario where you could just run around and go wherever next instead of this linear, guided and spoonfed progression through games.

I really loved the sequel too. I thought it was a great game . Maybe Nintendo felt that its sales never made another one necessary -- but given that the it came out as the NES was on its way out, I think that's a bit unfair.

I believe at least the first one came out on the Wii VC, but that was it. I really think it could be a great game to revamp on the 3DS or even make as a downloadable title on the Wii U.

Just figured I would share my last few days in the world of gaming. Ironically on the day Mass Effect 3 comes out, haha. 

The last few years it seems that gamers have really became jaded, myself included. I have been purging a lot of things I don't need from my life lately and I sat down and thought about gaming.  

I haven't used my PS3 in a long time, maybe about  a week when Skyrim came out, and every now and again to play Street Fighter 2 HD. Steam has really won me over lately and I have far more indie games that I actually play, on the PC. 

Anyhow I tried to find out why I was so jaded and I guess I just realized that games are big and fancy and cool now, but they have just lost most mechanics that actually make them games. More like interactive movies with a lot of extras that you need to buy later. Not to mention the whole used game thing that's been going on for a few years. 

I realized, sometimes, a game is just a game and I think Nintendo has really stuck to that. I didn't give the Wii a fare shake when it was released, mainly because of the whole soccer moms in the media thing it had surrounding it for a while. Though I got looking at the titles that have came out since and it really has a great selection of characters that I love, and totally abandoned.  

Anyways, I have a Wii, Monster Hunter 3, Mario Kart, 2 controllers, 2 wheels, wii sports and sports resort in the mail. Also come Friday I will have a PS3 and about 15 games boxed up to send into Amazon.

I especially am a fan of pokemon, I've been playing since I was 7, starting with emerald. And I'm proud of my pokemon ""obsession.""

The thing is, people are always like ""Grow up, Stop playing baby games"" and ""Play real games like Call of Duty.""
Why the FUCK do people do this? is there anything that you guys say that gets them to stop this? it pisses me off so much. ",,False,,t5_2qhnk,False,,basicpokemon,True,t3_1kge42,http://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1kge42/why_do_people_think_nintendo_games_are_childish/,

Our culture is xenophobic. I have plenty of interests that don't get localized in these parts. Just as an incoming example, how about those special edition One Piece 3DS XLs? 

I have a basic 3DS. A teal system from launch. It works great. I still love it. My eyes, however, suck. I'd really like an XL, but there are all kinds of cool colors and editions that I will never see here in the west. Sure, Reggie defended Nintendo's reasons for not bringing so many over, but... that doesn't help me as a gamer.

Likewise, not being able to play the new One Piece game itself doesn't help me as a gamer.

Or how about those Shonen Jump games.

I **WANT** to give Nintendo my money. I think a lot of us do.

We've seen lately that these massive companies will listen to gamers if there is continuous pressure. Look at how gamers have fought the Xbox One into a machine that honestly isn't nearly as terrible as it was going to be for the industry and for gamers, because we fought.

So, we elicited a response from Nintendo. Fantastic. Does anyone else feel blown off? Why don't we keep fighting this?",,False,,t5_2qhnk,False,,basiczelda,True,t3_1kgnbx,http://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1kgnbx/can_we_not_give_up_the_region_locking_fight/,
