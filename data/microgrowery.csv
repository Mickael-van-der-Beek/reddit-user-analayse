**Items you will need**

* [Seeds](http://www.reddit.com/r/microgrowery/comments/y7xrv/the_official_microgrowery_seedbank_thread_the/) or start with some from your last sack (but you never know what you're going to get with those).  Here is a discussion on [Autoflower vs Photoperiod](http://www.reddit.com/r/microgrowery/comments/19epfs/photoperiod_vs_autoflowering_cannabis_guide/).
* Growing medium- Soil ([Fox Farms Ocean Forest](http://foxfarmfertilizer.com/index.php/item/ocean-forest-potting-soil.html) is popular), Rockwool, Coco, Perlite, and Clay Pellets.  Avoid anything that advertises ""extended"" or ""slow"" release nutrients in the soil or claims of multiple-months of nutrients.
* Lights &amp; a [Light Timer](http://www.homedepot.com/h_d1/N-5yc1v/R-100685854/h_d2/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10053&amp;langId=-1&amp;keyword=electrical+timer&amp;storeId=10051)
* [Ventilation](https://www.icmag.com/ic/showthread.php?t=112862)
* Nutrients - [Fox Farms Trio](http://foxfarmfertilizer.com/products_liqfert1.html), [FloraNova](http://generalhydroponics.com/site/index.php/products/nutrients/nova_series/), [General Organics](http://generalhydroponics.com/site/index.php/products/general_organics/), [Advanced Nutrients](http://www.advancednutrients.com/hydroponics/ProductList.php), and many others.  Anything that claims ""extended"" or ""slow"" release is a bad idea for cannabis.
* Pots with good drainage - Anything with holes in the bottom of it. Many people use black 5gal buckets, [Smart Pots](http://www.smartpots.com/), or others.
* pH Tester and/or PPM Tester for testing your water and nutrient mix.
* Jeweler's loupe or microscope for looking at trichomes

We also have several starter-kits put together [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/microgrowery/comments/10vk3x/new_grower_buying_and_upgrading_guide/) that can help you pick a light &amp; tent appropriate for your grow area &amp; # of plants.

**Grow Area**

Next, you need to determine where your grow will take place. Will it be your closet, attic, basement, custom grow box, etc.? The ideal place needs to be well ventilated and large enough to grow plants to your desired height and width whilst having lighting, fans, and other equipment in there as well. Also, keep in mind that you don't want any light leaks, this is important for stealth and flowering reasons.

Once you have chosen your designated grow area, make sure you have thoroughly cleaned it, painted the walls white or hang reflective material. You do not want a dirty grow room. 

Once you have prepared the room, you can now begin to install your lights and ventilation. Be sure that everything is sturdy and done properly. If you half ass this, it's possible that later on in your grow something could fall and destroy your crop. Take your time and do it right.

Keep your lights close as you can. A simple test to see if they are too close is to place your hand at the top of your plant and hold it there for 30 seconds. If your hand does not burn from the heat, neither will the plant


**Planting your first seeds**

*This is usually where a lot of mistakes take place, so please read this carefully.*

There are several ways to germinate your seeds. Placing them inside a [damp paper towel in a dark place](http://www.growweedeasy.com/sites/growweedeasy.com/files/paper-towel-method.jpg), drop them in a [shot glass](https://www.google.com/webhp?hl=all#q=shot+glass+germination).  Or just simply planting them in dirt.

To germinate in dirt you want to start off in a small growing container. Wet the soil first, stick your pinky about half way down then drop 1 seed in. Cover the hole lightly, don't compact the dirt too much. Now, place it under your lighting for 24 hours a day. It may take up to 10 days before it sprouts, so be patient. Seeds don't always sprout, if it's been 15 days and still no show you can probably call it quits and plant a new seed.

Once you have a sprouted seed, lightly spray it with water every other day or so. It is very important not to over water. 


**Vegetation Period** 

Soon, your plant will out root the small container it's in You will need to transplant it into a much larger container. Prepare your new, large, drain-able pot. Take the container your plant is in, and gently bend the sides. What this does is break off any dirt or roots that are touching the inside walls. Now that you have done this, you can *carefully and slowly* turn the cup upside down and the contents of the cup will slide right out. You can break off some of the dirt, but do not let any of the roots be exposed to light. They will dry out and die. Quickly, place your plant into the new pot. Give it a nice watering and place it back into the grow room under 24-on/0-off hours of lighting (or 18/6). Your plant will probably not grow for a day or so, this is normal after transplanting. 

It is important that you keep your plants under a strict 24/0 or 18/6 lighting schedule during the vegetation period.  If they get too long a dark period they will begin to flower.

**Watering and Nutrients and pH, oh my**

Water your plant when the soil is dry.  This is the #1 mistake new growers make - they water too often.  Overwatering is not ""giving the plant too much water"" it is ""giving the plant water too often.""  There are two simple steps to watering cannabis:

1. Wait until the soil is dry a knuckle or so deep (use your finger, poke a hole, feel the dirt).
2. Add water until you see some drain out the bottom of your pot.  Go to step 1.

Nutrients should be used carefully and correctly.  Follow the dosing schedule provided by your nutrient line, but ramp up the amount slowly.  It is not suggested you start with the full dosage right away, but something like 1/4, then 1/2, and so on.  Furthermore, it is also not recommended to use nutrients with every watering.  Most alternate or put two plain-water feedings in between a nutrient-water feeding.

pH testing is important as all the nutrients you are feeding your plant will only be absorbed by the roots under the proper conditions, and those proper conditions are dictated by the pH of the nutrient mix and the soil.  Test your water before adding nutrients, test your nutrient mix, and test your run-off.  You want the nutrient+soil mixture to be in the 6.3-6.8 range for soil.  You want the nutrient mix to be in the 5.5-6.1 range for a hydroponic set up.  Consult [these charts](http://www.420magazine.com/forums/indoor-soil-cultivation/114733-ph-nutrient-uptake-charts.html) for more information.   You may need to obtain pH up or pH down products to regulate the water and/or nutrient mix to achieve the correct pH balance.


**Training**

There are many ways to train your plant to increase the yield. Use one or multiple of these techniques to create more tops/colas (budsites) or to promote stronger stalks and more vigorous nutrient uptake.

* [Low Stress Training aka LST](http://i.imgur.com/RmIBJ.jpg) - tying your plant down to expose more of the undergrowth to direct light, and thus promote more yield
* [SCReen Of Green aka SCROG](http://www.rollitup.org/general-marijuana-growing/438789-lbhs-scrog-tutorial.html) - train your plant into a screen/net to provide an even canopy of buds
* [Topping or Fimming](http://images.wikia.com/cannabis/images/6/6f/Fimming_v_topping.jpg) - cutting the top off of a stalk to split it into two stalks
* [Super Cropping](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vacg2FZWtrk) - bending/breaking/snapping the stalks to promote a more vigorous nutrient uptake after the plant heals itself

It is very important that you do this during vegetation and not in flowering.   Abuse them in veg, treat them like princesses in flowering.

You can keep your plant in vegetation as long as you wish. However, most people have space limitations. The key is, grow your plants to about half of your space limits (remember to add space for your light and space for cool air beneath the light). The plants tend to double (or sometimes triple) in height in the early flowering stage.  After 2-3weeks of flowering most will have hit their maximum height.


**Cloning**

Cloning is a rather easy and faster alternative compared to planting seeds every cycle. Typically, you should cut your clones a couple weeks prior to flowering to give the mother plant a chance to heal and regrow. [Here is a thorough guide on cloning](http://www.kindgreenbuds.com/marijuana-grow-guide/cloning.html).


**Flowering Period**

In order to activate flowering, you will need to switch your lighting schedule to a strict 12/12 schedule. This means 12 hours of light and 12 hours of *pure darkness* Any light leaks can cause damage, please be sure it's dark.

You will also want to start adding your blooming/flowering nutrients of your choice. Again, it might be a safe idea to start off small and work your way up to the suggested amount. 

After about a week or two, you will also be able to [determines its sex](http://i.imgur.com/WySYH.jpg). It is a very easy thing to do. *If you are not sure on the sex, post pictures and ask the community.*

If you get any males, you will need to chop them down and get rid of it. The reason for this is, if those pollen sacks pop, the pollen will spread and the females will become covered with his pollen. To simplify this, she will then produce seeds within her bud and the bud will be less potent. Ideally, you want a non pollinated female, she will produce the strongest and best weed. 

As flowering proceeds, you will notice translucent trichomes appear.
[This is how you will judge when your grow is ready to be harvested.](http://i.imgur.com/I2S1g.jpg) This is ultimately up you depending on what type of high you are looking for. You can expect these to appear around 6-8 weeks or even 10-12 weeks on some strains. Patience is virtue.


**Harvesting**

[Chop](http://www.rollitup.org/harvesting-curing/385918-simple-harvest-cure-step-step.html) and then [cure the buds](https://www.icmag.com/ic/showthread.php?t=156237).

Growing marijuana is a fun hobby and the outcome is very rewarding. However, it is hard and you need to be dedicated before getting started.

I've heard this question so many times here that I've decided to put together this ""buyer's guide"" of a few different common kits and the links to purchase them. Hopefully it will help eliminate some of the confusion when it comes to people trying to start their first grow the right way. 

Below you will find a series of kits that I've put together with their shopping lists. I'm only going to list Amazon links mostly for the sake of consistency, you may be able to find slightly cheaper prices on ebay or another source in some cases so be sure to always check around for the best price on all these items before you make your purchase. Also check the reviews, I'm only listing the lowest price I can find on Amazon. If you want to get name brand equipment you would need to purchase them separately. Just replace the ballast in the kits below with an equal wattage Lumatek ballast and then choose your hood style and get Hortilux bulbs. You can spend hundreds more on these kits by buying high quality name brand components.

Last but not least, these kits are in my opinion what is needed to grow high quality cannabis. Opinions may vary, use your best judgement on what's right for your situation. 

These kits will only include the basic setup for a tent, lights and ventilation, you will need to figure out how much ducting you need depending on the setup.

**Don't forget you also need pots, soil, nutrients, pH meter or test strips with pH up and down, TDS meter, trich microscope, fiskars, ties to LST your plants, and other extras of the sort.** 

Ok Lets get started!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Update:** I added my personal setup as ""Bud Master Premium"". The difference is that it uses name brand equipment and a hood sized to fit my 4x4 tent. All were purchased separately instead of in a premade kit. It raises the price but you get better quality and a more tailored fit. [Pictures of it in action.](http://imgur.com/a/KOvgG)

**Update 2:** Nutrients! If you need nutrients I found a place that sells small quantities of nutrients for small grows so you don't have to buy a years worth of nutes just for 1 grow. I worked it out so you also get 10% off on your first order if you email him on ebay and tell him Justintime233 sent you. I make no money from this, I just get the same discount on my first order which was [Connoisseur A&amp;B with 6 other AN additives](http://i.imgur.com/Xf6Nu.jpg) for my [waterfarm bucket project](http://i.imgur.com/chvFP.jpg). The shipping was fast and nothing leaked. So here's his Ebay store, [The Nute House](http://stores.ebay.com/advancednutrientsfoxfarmsupplies) just make your purchase and then email him on ebay and let him know I sent you and he'll refund 10%. **This is for your first order only.** 

To figure out how much to buy for your grow just go to the nutrient companies website and look at their feeding schedule and add up how much you need for an entire grow for 1 plant. Then just multiply from there. If it's going to be for more than 4-5 plants you might just be better off buying full bottles. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Disclaimer: Please use your head when choosing a kit. Consider the amount of heat it will put out for your space and make sure you buy all the accessories you need whether you need to order them or get them locally. This is just a basic guide to get you started, some additional research is required on your part to make sure the setup will work for your situation. I'm running 1600w and heating my house with it for the winter, in the summer I have to run my AC 24/7.*

---------------------------------------------------

**LED Grow Setup ""The Richie Rich""**

First off a bit about purchasing a LED. There is a lot of misinformation provided by manufacturers that you need to disregard. If the light uses 3w LEDs they are not powered at 3w, they're actually powered around 1.8w. So a light that claims to be 135w because it has 45 3w LEDs is actually only a 81 watt light. Only go by the true wattage when purchasing a LED light. A lot of manufacturers won't provide this information so you need to figure it out on your own using this formula: 

Number of LEDs x 1.8 = ~True wattage some models vary

* 2 [360w Growblu 120x3w LED Panels](http://growblu.com/120x3w-apollo-led-grow-light) (249w true watts each, 65.8w per sq ft.)

* 1 [4"" inline fan with carbon filter](http://www.amazon.com/Hydroponics-Inline-Scrubber-Carbon-Filter/dp/B004Q2ER5C/ref=sr_1_1?s=hi&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1349241681&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=4%22+inline+fan+combo) and [speed controller](http://www.amazon.com/Hydrofarm-ACSC-Duct-Speed-Adjuster/dp/B003URBQ1M/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1360007848&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=active+air)

**The Good**

* Built in fans help keep the temperature down

* Works well for veg and flower

* Able to produce a half pound or more every 3-4 months(depending on experience)

* You'll be cool with your purple tent pictures in /r/microgrowery #hashtips

**The Bad**

* Expensive initial cost

* Rampant manufacturer misinformation making it hard to choose a good product for your space.

* Higher failure rate than HID ballasts

**Final Price:** ~$1300

---------------------------------------------------

**How much would these kits cost as far as your electric bill is concerned?**

It all depends on the wattage of your lights, how long they run each day, and the cost of electricity where you live.

For example, in flowering your light would be on for 12 hours a day. Lets say you have a single 1000w light. That's 12kwh per day, ~31 days in a month so 12x31=372kwh per month to run that light. My power is ~$.08 per kwh so it would cost me $29.76 per month extra. Some people's power rates are as high as $.20 or more per kwh in some areas.  This example should help you figure out what the costs would be like in your area.

---------------------------------------------------

So that's it for now, I may update with more kits later. Of course there are more tent sizes and options out there, I just wanted to put some together to hopefully take the guesswork out of putting together your first real grow or upgrading your existing one. 

**Please feel free to post more extreme and elaborate setups in the comments below!!**

Happy Growing!!

Instead of posting general questions like ""How do I grow?"", please do a little research of your own.

There are many books on the topic and picking up one or two is a great idea.  Videos are also nice because you can just sit back and let the information soak in.

Since we keep getting the question over and over about where to buy seeds I think we need to just have one giant discussion about it and put it to rest. If it turns out well we can see if the mods will sidebar it so others can have a fast reference with a ton of great comments and suggestions. 

So, I ask for all of you to participate and offer your experiences with these seedbanks and add to the list if you've purchased from somewhere else.

------------------------------------------------------------

**Update: ""What is a good strain for a beginner that doesn't smell much?""**

Since this gets asked constantly I figured I'd just answer it right here. Northern Lights is considered to be very easy to grow and is not 
overpowering with smell either, it will still smell some though. Other than that suggestion just grow what you want to smoke would be my advice.

One of my close friends is an electrician, and I was having some electrical problems, so I asked him some vague questions.  Long story short after a bit, he started questioning why he couldn't just come over and help, and why I was asking specific questions.  

So I came clean with him.  He's been a friend of mine for decades, so as much as I wanted to keep this as a 1 person intel, I told him.  He agreed not to tell anyone at all.

However, he was at my place last night with his girlfriend, and he asked how my grow was going, right in front of her.  I gave him a dirty look, and managed to change the subject.

But today I talked to him, and I flat out told him, if you tell people, you could literally RUIN my life.  He was put back about how I worded it, and realized how he made a monster mistake.  He understands now, this is not his news to be sharing, and was extremely apologetic.

But I just wanted to remind everyone out there, the less people who know, the better.

For the past week or so the mods have been busy behind the scenes setting up the [**new MicroGrowery Wiki**](http://www.reddit.com/r/microgrowery/wiki/index).

In case you don't subscribe to any subreddits that use or promote the reddit wiki feature, this is something that was initially made available about a year ago that allows subreddits to implement a wiki for their subscribers and consequently have a better tool to maintain a repository of information as opposed to sidebar links of past posts.

The wiki, as you will notice, makes formatting and conveying information much easier and results in data that is more organized, readable and easy to navigate, especially when compared to the limitations placed on standard posts.

A large portion of the relevant sidebar content has been ported to the wiki, but if you feel there is something missing or a category to be added please use this thread to let the mods know. 

###Initially only mods will be allowed to edit the wiki.###

To start with, changes to the wiki will be made exclusively by the mods but as time goes on we will start adding approved wiki contributors that express interest in helping to maintain the wiki and show initiative in helping others. This may or may not tie into the Trusted Grower system we are still working on.

**For now if you want to write a guide, DIY article, or anything else you feel is relevant and belongs in the wiki**, then either mention it in this thread or [send a message to the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fmicrogrowery) and we will discuss it.

Lastly, you will also notice that the links in the header and sidebar now point to the corresponding wiki entries and not the original posts which they used to reference. Again, if you have any feedback on the wiki please use this thread for it.

Welcome to /r/microgrowery's first new grower thread.  New to growing?  Not sure where to begin?  Have a question you're afraid to ask?  Intimidated by other grows and nervous to start?  Just need some advice?  Want to show off your spindly stalk of a seedling and *not* get shit on for it?  Trying to find another grower at the same stage as you for a partner?  Need some handholding or reassurance? Come on in!  Experienced, patient growers will be here to help answer.

**No question is ignorant or stupid in this thread.**  

Answerers: Please be helpful and constructive. If you can't be either, please just avoid the thread.  Mean spirited ""start over"" ""give up"" and ""you're a moron for doing it that way"" comments will be summarily deleted. \

Late-In-The-Day-Suggestion: sort the comments by new to find new-ish ones without answers.  I'm getting a few too many to respond to everyone ;)

1. Talk about it (or grow around 3rd parties) - You know you can trust your [friends/family](http://theents.com/state-v-mcguire/) right? They won't tell anyone, and you know for sure that your [girlfriend wont say anything right](http://theents.com/cressend-v-waugh/)?

2. Don't control the smell - Police need warrants to search or seize property in most circumstances, but there are a heck of a lot of legitimate circumstances where police will be on your property or possibly even in your house. [If they smell it, you are going down.](http://theents.com/category/that-smell/)

3. Keep a suspicious home - If no one lives there, or there is a weird structure in the back yard, or if all the windows are blacked out or insulated or boarded up, or if people come and go at odd hours, then people will wonder and suspicions will be raised. [You know what is suspicious.](http://theents.com/category/suspicious-home/) Blend in, and don't give a reason to look like the neighborhood jerk.

4. Grow outside - As I said before, police can and will be on your property at some point for a legitimate reason: pursuing a running felon or knocking on your door to return your dog that slipped outside the fence earlier in the day. [If they can see/smell your grow from where they are legitimately allowed to be](http://theents.com/category/outdoor-obvious/) then they can go ahead and get that warrant.

5. Put your paraphernalia and clippings in the trash - [Trash placed by the curb is NOT protected](http://theents.com/category/trash-search/) under your 4th amendment rights so no warrant necessary. If there is even the slightest suspicion by police (or even no suspicion at all) then they can root around in your trash. When they find clippings, HID boxes, etc, well, their case is starting to get made.

6. Use enormous amounts of energy - The electric company is not going to care about or notice a new 1000w HPS running 24/7 in your home. But they will make a report when you use so much energy that they have to [install a special transformer](http://theents.com/category/electric-bill/electric-company-initiative/) at your property to handle the load. Most of the time the police already suspect you and they [subpoena your electric bills on their own](http://theents.com/category/electric-bill/subpoena/). This helps build their probable cause so that they can get a warrant to search.

7. Be a complete retard - Grow 150 plants and then [fire guns](http://theents.com/category/idiot-defendant/) into the air around your neighborhood and almost hit a sleeping baby.

Every free second that I had not staring at my plants, I was researching, posting and conversing with all of you like-minded friends. 

My fiance got pregnant and she decided that she didn't feel safe with my growing in the same house that our daughter will be born into. I complied and tore down all of my equipment, cut all of my plants down with a pair of scissors, threw all of my clones and cuttings in a garbage bag and sold all of the equipment.

I felt that just as I was getting really really good at this stuff, it was all pulled from underneath me. I understand why, I get it and my Fiance's feeling of safety and comfort is more important to me.

But that doesn't mean that inside, I don't feel really sad about it. This was really the first hobby that I dove headfirst into, investing money and time and tried to excel at in new ways every single day. 

I work a full time job, would come home at 6 and spend sometimes 2 1/2 - 3 hours after work down in my ""lab"", sometimes just staring, but most of the time; learning.  

I miss it. I miss opening up the tent and seeing new growth every day. I miss cutting 20 clones and watching them all battle to be the best and see who will last. I miss getting my brothers over once every month or so for harvest and sitting around complaining about our backs after a long trimming session. 

I miss coming here every day and commenting on things and asking for advice and arguing and just being a part of such a knowledgeable and growing community. 

There are so many things I miss about this. The constant yearning for more knowledge, the extremely late-night research sessions on my phone while in bed.

I don't know, this is a long ass ramble and I don't expect anyone to finish it and comment to this shit, but I signed into this account today and it all just kind of came rushing to me.

I miss you guys, I miss the grow, I miss the knowledge &amp; learning. I miss the hobby, I miss the game :(

I see you even got rid of his lighting guide, you are clearly not helping but hindering this board and I will be no part of it.  Suck up what ever power tripping pride you have and do something for the good of everyone not just your self. 

Go ahead and ban me too see if I give a fuck.

Edit

I didn't know the whole story, but it sure is entertaining.   I still think you should unban him.  I actually would have posted a question on wiring an extra 4000 watts had I thought someone would correctly answer my question.  But this is no longer the case.

I would have gotten this done sooner, but I had to space the cost of everything out over a few months.

[Here are the pics.](http://imgur.com/a/79OFD)

As you can see, I've got a 400cfm fan, 400w HID, and a 14 inch carbon filter crammed into this tight space. In hindsight, I now wish I had picked up a larger clothing armoire instead of this television armoire, but in the end I've been able to make this work quite well.

The plants are feminized Kaya Gold, and are just over five weeks into veg. They've been under the HID since week 2, but because I didn't have proper ventilation before now I had to run it at half to three-quarter strength to manage the heat. I'm now happily using all 400 watts.

In all I would estimate I put about $350-400 into building this box, and the equipment is such that I can continue to use it when I upgrade to a slightly larger space.

One thing to note, if you're working on something similar and plan on using a speed controller to manage your inline fan, do not purchase the [Speedster](http://www.amazon.com/SE-Electronic-Stepless-Speed-Controller/dp/B000HQAVNI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1355006383&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=speedster) like I did. This causes your fan to make an audible humming sound, defeating the stealth goal of this project. I'm planning on returning it in favor of this [variable transformer](http://www.amazon.com/Variac-Variable-Transformer-300va-Output/dp/B006NGI8VS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1355006494&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=variac) (here's a [thread with more info](http://www.rollitup.org/grow-room-design-setup/386713-fan-speed-controller-noisy.html)).


**UPDATE:**

I added some more pictures to the album showing how I light-proofed the box. This [proved to be the trickiest part](http://i.imgur.com/ySx2i.jpg) of the project, especially because the original doors on the armoire were meant to slide into the primary cavity. While I initially tried to plug the gaps with [cheap foam window weather stripping](http://i.imgur.com/SMpN9.jpg), that didn't quite cut it. To create a better air/light seal around the door gaps, I mounted narrow wood boards right behind the door gaps (stained to match the exterior wood color) and ran angled weather stripping between the door and the boards to create the seal. I used brown caulk to fill in the rest of the gaps.

**Components List**

- Armoire (found mine on craigslist for $35)

- 400w HID MH/HPS

- Inline fan

- Carbon filter

- 6"" semi-ridig ducting

- 6"" hose clamps x4

- PVC Elbows x12 (light traps for passive air intake, spray paint interior black)

- White paint

- Small desk fan

- ~~fan speed controller~~ Variac variable transformer [(details on why I switched)](http://www.reddit.com/r/microgrowery/comments/16u2ja/when_stealth_is_key_comparing_the_noise_level_of/)

- rubber weatherstripping, small blocks of wood (light proofing)

- Brown caulk to fill in the gaps

There might be a few other odds and ends, but that's about the gist of my setup. I'll answer whatever questions I can and expand this list as needed.

Revision: 9


0. **I have no idea what I'm doing, someone hold my hand please!**
&gt; *Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day.  Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.*
&gt;
&gt; Please, please, please, please do some research.  Read the rest of this document.  Read the [Beginner's Guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/microgrowery/comments/w3qz7/beginners_guide/).  Google ""how to grow cannabis""  Go buy a grow book from Amazon.  Read the last several weeks of posts on the subreddit.  Get a feel for how this works in general terms and in specific terms.
&gt;
&gt; No one wants to hold your hand.  We want to help you help yourself.

1. **My leaves are curling up/curling down/dying/yellow/brown/spotted/red/etc - What's wrong with my plant?** 
&gt; **The #1 issue** causing ""funny looking leaves"" is a pH imbalance.  The pH of the growth medium your plants are in is *very* important to nutrient uptake.  Look at this chart: http://i.imgur.com/ewmL8.jpg and this one: http://i.imgur.com/UkQ0S.jpg.  These show the appropriate pH range for nutrient uptake.  Nutrients are important to your plant, and the pH being outside the appropriate range will prevent certain nutrients from being absorbed by the roots and into the plant.  
&gt;
&gt; To fix a pH imbalance, there are several paths ahead of you.  **All** require some sort of pH measuring device - be it a pH pen, test strips, or drops.  You need a way to measure the pH or will not know how to correct it.  If you suspect a pH imbalance in soil - test the runoff (the water that drains from the bottom of the pot).  In a hydro set up, test water in your reservoir.  The pH imbalance can be corrected by using pH Up and pH Down solutions (chemicals, organic products, etc) that adjust the pH Level of your water and/or water+nutrient mix.  You use the pH adjustment products to raise or lower the pH of your water to bring the runoff/reservoir measurement into the appropriate range.  Use the pH adjustment *after* you add nutrients, so that you are adjusting your nutrient mix, not just the water used before adding nutrients.  You want the solution that is going on your roots to be in the proper pH range.
&gt; 
&gt; If you have been using nutrients, one of the biggest causes of a pH imbalance is too many salts in the soil, dramatically affecting (usually lowering) the pH, locking out lots of nutrients.  If you have been adding nutrients and not account for pH changes and notice ""funny looking leaves"" - please please please be aware the solution almost certainly does not involve MORE nutrients.  You first need to fix the pH issue in your medium - this may involve flushing the medium with a *lot* of water to push any built-up salts out of the medium.
&gt; 
&gt; **The #2 issue** causing ""funny looking leaves"" is a nutrient deficiency.  **ONLY** proceed to this section if you are sure your pH is correct.  There is no way to resolve or even properly diagnose a nutrient deficiency if your pH is out of range.
&gt; 
&gt; Consult these charts &amp; images: [Images of Deficiency and Abundance of Fertilization Elements](http://i.imgur.com/14DFU.jpg), [Nitrogen Issues](http://i.imgur.com/pYkDD.jpg), [Phosphorus Issues](http://i.imgur.com/kHRcn.jpg), [Potassium Issues](http://i.imgur.com/hvym1.jpg), [Zinc &amp; Magnanese Issues](http://i.imgur.com/zdRhT.jpg), [Magnesium Issues](http://i.imgur.com/Gjkn3.jpg), [Iron &amp; Sulfur Issues](http://i.imgur.com/kaSDo.jpg), [Nutrient Deficiency Diagnosis Table #1](http://i.imgur.com/xMdHK.jpg), [Nutrient Deficiency Diagnosis Table #1](http://i.imgur.com/UXrf1.jpg) to determine what the issue may be.  Match what your leaves look like with the images and descriptions.  Then take to your favorite search engine and search for resolutions to ""magnesium deficiency cannabis"" and do some research.
&gt; 
&gt; **The #3 issue** causing ""funny looking leaves"" is a watering problem.  Either too much water or too little.  You can give a plant too much water by giving it water **too often**.  As long as your container has drainage (holes in the bottom of your pot) - the amount of water you add at once *doesn't matter*.  Remember the two easy steps to watering cannabis:
&gt; 
&gt; Wait until the soil is dry a knuckle or so deep.  This means stick your finger in the dirt and feel it.
&gt; 
&gt; Add water or water+nutrients until it drains out of the container.  Go to the first step.

2. **Is this plant a boy or a girl?**
&gt; Your plant will start to show gender 1-2 weeks after you change the lighting schedule to 12 hours-on/12 hours-off.  If you're growing outside you will need to pay attention to the plant following the beginning of the shortening of daylight.  The start of 12/12 is the start of the flowering cycle.  The plant will start to produce flowers, and you sex the plant by looking at the miniature starts of the flowers.  Consult this image to compare: http://i.imgur.com/WySYH.jpg.  Boy plants have ""balls"" or ""sacks.""  Girl plants have little white hairs.  Unless you desire more seeds, you should cull boy plants from your room and grow only girl plants to harvest.  

3. **Is this plant ready to harvest?**
&gt; http://i.imgur.com/I2S1g.jpg is the simplest guide.  Unless you're able to show /r/microgrowery pictures like that one, please don't bother asking.  We cannot tell you when to harvest simply by looking at the size, or the hairs, or the green, or the time, or ANYTHING except the trichomes - and we can't see them in a normal picture.

3. **How much light do I need?**
&gt; The short answer to the light question depends on what kind of light(s) you are using.  If you are using High Intensity Discharge (HID) lights like a High Pressure Sodium (HPS), Metal Halide (MH) or Ceramic Metal Halide (CMH) - you need between 50 watts per ft^2.   If you are using Compact Fluorescent Lights (CFL) - you need at least 80 watts per ft^2.   This means go measure your grow space, determine your light type, and then buy enough light (measured by watts) to cover that area.  *Please note, measure CFL lights with ""real"" wattage, not ""equivalent""*.  


4. **Is it safe to post pictures of my grow online?**
&gt; To safely share pictures of your grow online you need to be aware of several things.   First, images taken with a digital camera contain information about that camera - including GPS coordinates in some cases (especially cell phones).  You need to remove this information from the pictures before posting them.  This information is called EXIF, and there are a number of free utilities available on the internet for removing EXIF information.   Also, if you use imgur.com to host the image, the site strips EXIF for you (but ""someone"" had a copy of the pictures with EXIF at one point - the more paranoid among you will want to strip the EXIF before uploading).
&gt; 
&gt; Also review your pictures for any personally identifiable information or objects.
&gt; 
&gt; You then need to find a place to post the pictures.  imgur.com is the ""preferred"" image host for reddit links.  But really anything that is anonymous and relatively ad-free will work.

5. **Where can I get seeds?**
&gt; Two options - use bagseed or buy some seeds online.  
&gt;
&gt; Online resources:
&gt;
&gt; * [Microgrowery Seedbank Reviews](http://www.reddit.com/r/microgrowery/comments/y7xrv/the_official_microgrowery_seedbank_thread_the/)
&gt; * [Attitude Seed Bank](https://www.cannabis-seeds-bank.co.uk/)
&gt; * [Nirvana](http://www.nirvanashop.com/en/)
&gt; * [Sensi Seeds](http://sensiseeds.com/)
&gt;
&gt; All offer stealth shipping.  The more paranoid among you may want to purchase with a disposable/reloadable Visa/Mastercard pre-paid card you buy at the grocery store.  Make sure to get one that works internationally.  The more paranoid may also want to consider shipping to an address *other* than the grow location.

6. **What is the difference between autoflower and photoperiod seeds?**
&gt; [Autoflower vs Photoperiod Seeds](http://www.reddit.com/r/microgrowery/comments/19epfs/photoperiod_vs_autoflowering_cannabis_guide/) Guide written by /u/EasilyUsed 

7. **Can you guys help me find weed in my area?**
&gt; No.  But we will help you grow it if you're willing to learn.

8. **I can't find Fox Farms Soil or Nutrient-Brand-X, what should I do?**
&gt; [Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com) will have what you need for a shipping cost.  Also search for ""hydroponics store"" + your zipcode/area.  

9. **Can I use this soil I got at Home Depot?**
&gt; Maybe.  But please be forewarned there are a lot of strongly held opinions about this topic and you would be *very* well served to do some Google research before asking.

10. **Does it smell a lot to grow?  What do I do about it?**
&gt; Yes.  It smells.  A lot.  The solution is a carbon filter and good ventilation.

11. **How can I store my seeds?**
&gt; Cool, dry, dark spot and they will last forever.

We've gotten a lot bigger as a community in the last year, which is a good thing, yet it comes with several challenges.


The first challenge is the increasing number of users. With that increase has come a corresponding increase in posts and links, and your Mod Team have concluded that not only is a slightly different moderation approach is in order, but that we also need an increase in number.


Therefore over time, Microgrowery will be increasing the number of moderators, and I'm happy to announce that the first to be chosen is Ogkushog. Please be gentle with him :)


Another issue that we're working on is the 'signal to noise' ratio of new links and posts. While we do not wish to leave the 'free speech' voting system that comes with Reddit, we do hope to add a little clarity.
To work towards this, we're aiming to soon have a 'Trusted MG'er' status, similar to how /r/glassheads use css icons that are granted to certain, trusted users. Such trusted users will have a special icon next to their posts and links, and ideally this will advertise that an owner is generally regarded as a knowledgeable, trusted individual within the /microgrowery community.  Bear with us on this, since there is the reddit code to wrestle with, but expect to see certain individuals bearing such icons 'soon'.


That I guess, was pretty much the 'happy' part of my post. It was nice while it lasted.


Now I'm going to come to what I mentioned briefly earlier, when I mentioned a slightly different moderation approach. Firstly let me explain *why* we consider we need a new approach.


This is supposed to be a place for people to talk, share, and learn. Disagreements are inherent to that but some of the disagreements we've been seeing as of late here are far too bitter, aggressive, and immature. Such disagreements rapidly explode with parties posting a 'tit for tat' argument that can soon clutter up the entire thread, and such events are bad for the subreddit as a whole.


People are tired of such 'dominance battles' or 'ego battles'. I feel we as mods have not been clear enough that it does not matter *how* big a persons tent is, or how many lamps they have *if they are a dick about it.*


*To be clear - We would rather have ten happy hobbyists making occasional mistakes and laughing about it here, than two 'uber elite' growers snapping and scowling at each other via subreddit posts.*


Therefore, from now on, the moderators will continue to request that everyone is as nice to each other as possible, and when people do disagree, that they do so in a calm, reasonable manner.  


However, from now, those who cannot will be formally warned, and then banned if they continue to be disruptive and/or unpleasant to others, regardless of how important they might see themselves to this subreddit, and regardless of their growing know-how.


TL/DR!

Congratulations to Ogkushog for becoming a Moderator!

Trusted Grower status coming soon!

A few more Moderator spots opening in the future as well!

*From now on, if you're being an asshole, we won't care how much you know, or grow. We'll just warn you, then ban you!*

Thanks for your time, people!

The helicopter was flying all over for twenty minutes scanning the land.  Come to find out they had spotted a few plants in the forested area on my farm and went to investigate it.  They just found a handful of plants and asked me if I knew anything about it while they sized me up.  I told them I did not and they said if anyone comes forward to tell them not to do it and left.  They were cordial enough but it was an uncomfortable experience with customers and volunteers around.

Of course I think this was a waste of resources on their part and I have no qualms with someone that wants to grow cannabis.  My concern is that this will affect my reputation in the community and with my neighbors since it was growing on my land and went down so publicly.  I ask that you please do not grow on someone else's property because you never know how it could harm them if it is discovered.

So I got these 3 plants harvested, dried and jarred up now so I figured I'd post the giant album I made during the process. 

I am more than happy with my yield this time around as 2 of the 3 had double or more than my last harvest of the same strains. I'm not sure if it was going from a 600w to a 1000w light or the addition of several additives or both but I love it. I was hoping for a half pound from 4 plants and did it in 3. Here are the totals:

God Bud=75.9g

Bubblegum=59.6g

BC Blueberry=93.5g 

Total: 229g (8.1oz)

**[Huge harvest album!!](http://imgur.com/a/DEQA0)**

I still have one more plant, my MTF, to harvest in a week or so that's looking like it's going to have at least 3 oz on it and another 3 MTFs that will be ready in another month. I'm loving the perpetual harvest now that I've got it all up and running and am seeing harvests every 4-6 weeks.

During my research, I found that our great state of Massachusetts has a very harsh law involving proximity to schools. Unfortunately, no matter how you slice it, our house is within a zone. And even with Governor Patrick's proposed legislature to lessen the regulation and penalty, the reality is that unless all laws around cultivation in MA were to disappear, we'd be at an exceptionally high risk. And it's not a risk we're willing to take for one or two plants for personal use.

On the upside, I did learn an immense amount about growing pot, and gardening in general. I'm actually interested in gardening for the first time in my 30+ years! I'm saving all of my research and information in the off-chance our risk were to up and disappear entirely in the near future (an ent can hope, can't he?). We're going to return our equipment and hopefully get most of our money back, so no loss there. (I may have an unused grow tent for sale, if anyone's interested - though we may actually put that to use, not sure yet.)

Recommendation: if you're thinking about home-growing, do not make the decision lightly. Do due diligence, and research your state and even local laws around growing pot. Think on it for a while. You may find some lesser-known law on the books that could put you at a far more major risk than most (the MA school law: mandatory minimum 2 year jail sentence).

And I *strongly* recommend you think on all of this while you have some stash, not when you're dry. I think our original dry-ness and desperation made us a little bolder about this than we should have been.

Godspeed, /microgrowery. See you around the /r. :)

Your pal,

I'm down to my last 3 nugs but tomorrow I'm going to harvest my 2 current plants. 

I love to smoke it, but  I also love planting the seeds, feeding it, watch it stretch almost everyday, see it bloom with beautiful buds, checking for trichomes once a day feeling the anticipation and excitement for the day they're ready to be harvested, trimming them, packing my mason jars and the smoke it for the first time. 

Why isn't this plant legal already? If it were, I'd drop everything I'm doing right now and start an organic weed farm and devote my life to it.  I hope I get to see legalization in my lifetime.

Well then. Today I came from work today and opened my apartments door. I found it peculiar that the second door was open because I am very careful to close it. Also, the door to the room containing my grow closet was open. Immediately got goose bumps.

Yup, the grow closet was open and the plants were neatly cut and gone. I walked through my apartment and found nothing else was disturbed. (Expect for some containers opened, etc.) I found a short note written in hand writing saying 

*""XXX, the police made a home search to your apartment at (time). The cannabis plants were confiscated. For more info, please be in contact with (address of local police station)""*

They had disassembled the lights and disconnected the fans, but left them in the room. There was some smoking paraphelia, ashtray, nutes and things of that nature in the flat, but they were not disturbed.

I'm so weirded out. There's no official looking search warrant left behind. No-one has keys to the flat except my land lord and the maintenance company. I know my land lord would never disturb my privacy (lived here on and off for 10 years and only once had a call because I had a loud party). It would be highly illegal from the maintenance company. (Thou they are the ones who give the keys on home searches).
In fact, very few people know this address because this is a flat I rent in city to work. My permanent residence is elsewhere.

There was no smell. Even in the room. I had a neat carbon filtering. 

I ordered my seeds from Nirvana and they came through the customs in stealth packaging. I cannot believe the police and the customs would have resources to track single seed packet and grower for months to bust them on harvest. 

...That is, if I had proper lights I would have been in harvest, but ""luckily"" I only had about 70W of CFL's there and thus had skinny plants with only small buds. Perhaps 5-10g worth of low thc content buds.

This is also my first grow ever and I haven't even smoked since vocational school in -97 or so. I only wanted a bit of plant to help me sleep and grew it myself because I don't want to be involved with the ""scene"" :(

Anyway, sorry to hype anyones paranoia. I just have no idea how in the fuck I got busted.

Now I should sleep. I'll contact the police in the morning and go interrogated. I don't want to make this any worse for myself.

The kind people over at /r/trees approached us a few weeks ago about participating in their new *Self Post Fridays* with an AMA.  This is a new thing they're trying, interviewing other cannabis reddits and encouraging more original content rather than the memes we know and love beaten like a dead horse.

You can see last weeks (the first) with /r/merchENTs: http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/zvpq1/we_are_your_friently_merchents_we_run_head_shops/.

So this Friday, September 21st, we're going to have a /r/microgrowery AMA over at /r/trees.  What we'd like to do is have anyone with at least one harvest under their belt to use the template below to post a top-level comment on the AMA (when it goes up).  Fill out the info, encourage users to ask you questions, and then answer as many as you can.

    **Growing Experience**: [years/harvests/description]

    **Currently Growing**: strain(s)

    **Equipment**: 

    * Lights:
    * Medium:
    * Nutrients:

    **Comments**: anything about your experience, background, links to grows, etc

---

Me, for example:

**Growing Experience**: Since January 2011.  Half dozen harvests and counting.

**Currently Growing**: pair of indica-leaning strains from clones from bagseed

**Equipment**: 

* Vegetative Cabinet: 2'x2'x2'  300W CFLs.  Fits quite a bit, generally has several clones, a couple small plants, and a couple medium sized plants.
* Flower Closet: 3'x3'x7'  400W High Pressure Sodium, 480W T-12s, 140W CFLs.  Fits 4, 5 gallon smart pots.
* Medium: moving toward an organic soil mix of my own, but right now it's a mix of Fox Farms Ocean Forest, perlite, blood meal, bone meal, earthworm castings, dolomite lime and azomite.  
* Nutrients: General Organics, full line.

**Comments**: I got started growing cause I was sick of buying weed.  Once I bought a house, I quickly set to creating an indoor grow in my basement closet.  I started out with a bunch of bagseed and some tube lights and have been steadily increasing ever since.  

I'm currently working towards setting up a perpetual harvest, where I'll be harvesting 2 plants every month.  That means taking clones, transplanting to bigger pots, moving from the vegetative cabinet to the flower closet, and harvesting 2 plants from the flower closet every month - in addition to the regular maintenance and feeding.  I have 4 plants in my flower closet, all at different stages, and more waiting in the wings in my vegetative cabinet.

My posting history is almost all /r/microgrowery, feel free to browse and ask any questions about my grow, experiences, or anything else.  

---

So yeah.  Please represent /r/microgrowery well.  Short term pain of some new users and extra questions will pay off with more content and pretty plant pictures.   We'll be reposting the Beginner's Guide and FAQ here on Friday so that any new eyes see those first.

my first PC Grow is finally harvested and in curing inside my jar :)
I surpassed my goal of harvesting atleast 1OZ from my first PC Grow and am glad to report a harvest of 33,7g of dry bud. 

[After hanging for 4 days and last trimmings](http://i.imgur.com/KoAuife.jpg)

[Inside the jar :)](http://i.imgur.com/1Jf2PPA.jpg)

(sorry I dont have a picture of the whole harvest on a scale, you can see my small-ass scale on the picture -_- I gave up after a few tried to somehow get all of it onto it...)

----------------
**Setup:**

* **Case:** Chieftec BA-01 Case
* **Veg:** 85W 6500k CFL
* **Flower:** 125 2700k CFL
* **Fan-Controller:** Scythe Kaze Master Ace (this powered all the fans and gave me fan-control &amp; temp-readings)
* **Intake:** DIY Lighttrap (using 1x Scythe Gentle Typhoon 1850RPM fan)
* **Outtake:** DIY Carbon filter (using 2x Scythe Gentle Typhoon 1850RPM fans) 

I also used a 2mm thick sheet of plexiglass as a kind of ""cooltube"" thing, worked great and helped me to stabilze temps around 26°C.

Also I decided to make a short album of all the pics that I had uploaded to the net :) here is it:

If you are doing or plan to do a PC Grow feel free to ask me, I might write up a guide for you guys when I find the time to do it. In the meantime please just PM me if you need advice regarding PC growing. I'm not a master grower though but I guess I have done a shitload of research and finished a quite successful PC grow now and might be able to help :)

I've been reading this subreddit for like 1/2 year now while I took the time to research, plan and build everything for my PC-Grow-Case.

Because my main reddit-account is known by some people I decided to make a new account for posts about my grow (I normally would trust those people but I definitly see the reasons why everyone is suggesting to keep it secret from absolutely everyone).


Stealth and odor-control is a must for me, friends know the smell of weed and I absolutely dont want them to ask me for ""homegrown"" every day. Besides that I've gone a bit overkill and attaced a real PC-plate and glued ""extension""-cables to it and connected it to the RaspberryPi (mini-ARM based PC running Debain Linux) - so yeah, u can attach USB, HDMI and sound to the case (USB on the front) and it will work. Also the power cable uses a normal PC-Power-Cord.


My Setup uses CFL bulbs, the one on the picture is a 85W 6500k bulb and I have another 125w 2700k bulb for flowering. 

For Odor-Control I have built an active carbon filter which is using 2 Scythe Gentle Typhoon 1850 RPM fans (push&amp;pull like in watercooling setups). The case has another fan (60x60 scythe mini-kaze) above the bulb to move the hot air from the bulb towards the fans of the filter and another PC-Fan blowing in air through the lighttrap.
Those fans are all powered by the Fan-Controller which is a ""Scythe Kaze Master Ace"", its powered by a 12V DC adapter which also supplys it with 5V for the LCD-Display (this one was a bitch). The Fan controller also has temperature control which will help me to control temps on different places in the case.

Im going to use LST and as you can see SCROG [EDIT: the SCROG Screen is used more as a ""height limiter"" than as conventional SCROG - see comments for further explanation] to keep the plants under control. The last thing i gotta do is eliminate the last few light-leaks I have (which are super small and should be fixed in like 15 minutes at most).

The strain is going to be Dinafem - Blue Widow x3 - the seeds are germing right now and i will put them into the soil as soon as the have sprouted :)

Hope for some feedback, this has been a hell lot of work and i can't wait to finally start growing.

A little update on this - the seeds have germed and I've put them into the soil, case is officially up and running now. [Case up and running](http://i.imgur.com/gOfUL.jpg)

**Photoperiod Cannabis:**

* Will vegetate essentially indefinitely on anything between an 18/6 and 24/0 light cycle.
* Can be cloned, one seed = unlimited plants.
* Will flower once put into a 12/12 light cycle.
* Usually will produce a usable yield in a longer amount of time.
* Can produce a larger plant and therefore higher yield.
* Will produce a more potent bud.
* Can take more abuse due to unlimited vegetation period.
* Responds well to topping and super cropping in the vegetative cycle.

**Autoflowering Cannabis:**

* Will vegetate for a limited amount of time before automatically going into flowering mode (each strain's vegetative time will be different).
* Cannot be cloned (in the traditional sense), one seed = one plant.
* Will flower automatically, regardless of light cycle.
* Usually will produce usable yield sooner.
* Will produce a smaller plant and therefore limited yield.
* Will produce less potent buds.
* Can't take much abuse due to limited growth time.
* May not respond well to topping and super-cropping.

**Both:**

* It its natural state, cannabis is an [annual plant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant). This means that these plants grow from new seeds every year, and die at the end of the flowering process, ideally mating, creating and releasing seeds that will grow as the next generation.
* Can be stressed and hermie based on light cycle changes.
* Seeds can generate male or female plants, unless the seeds are feminized.
* Need the same amount of nutrient care.
* Can potentially be grown to produce the same size plants with similar yields.
* Respond well to LST and SCROG

&gt; ***The in-depth differences:***

**Photoperiod Cannabis:**

Photoperiod cannabis is the 'industry' standard; it is the natural state of THC-potent cannabis strains. [cannabis sativa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_sativa) and [cannabis indica](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_indica) will vegetate almost indefinitely on anything between an 18/6 and 24/0 light schedule, it will only enter full flowering mode when its lighting schedule is limited to 12/12. If planted outside, growing photoperiod cannabis is only viable ""naturally"" when planted at the beginning of the summer, naturally entering flowering mode at the end of the summer when the days become shorter. Outdoor naturally grown cannabis will be ready to harvest in the fall (specifics varying depending on location, as daylight availability depends on your latitude). Outdoor cannabis will not grow naturally any other time of year without supplemental lighting and darkness.

Photoperiod cannabis may be easier to grow indoors for new growers because it can be abused in the vegetative state and have time to recover because it can be vegetated until the grower decides to change the light cycle to flowering. The flowering process is generally thought to be the most delicate time for the plant; so the utmost care should be given to a plant in its flowering cycle.

Photoperiod cannabis can be cloned indefinitely. Cuts can be taken from photoperiod cannabis to create rooted clones of the plant at any stage, and can be vegetated into large plants before being put into (or back into) the flowering stage.

**Autoflowering Cannabis:**

Autoflowering cannabis is a human-created crossbreed of [cannabis ruderalis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_ruderalis) and cannabis sativa and/or cannabis indica. Cannabis ruderalis is a strain of cannabis that naturally will enter its flowering cycle based on a given time since its germination, regardless of light cycle. This is in contrast to photoperiod cannabis, which will generally **only** enter flowering when the light cycle has been changed to 12/12. The automatic flowering nature of ruderalis creates a smaller plant, as its vegetative cycle is naturally limited, whereas a photoperiod strain can be vegetated into a much larger plant before switching to a flowering light cycle.

Cannabis ruderalis is also a non-THC potent strain, so when it is cross bred with high-THC-producing sativa or indica, it retains some of the ruderalis properties, and some of the sativa or indica properties, leading to a lesser THC content than a strictly non-ruderalis strain.

Between these two traits, autoflowering strains will theoretically produce not only less bud, but also less potent buds. Photoperiod strains that are flowered immediately or grown in limited root-space can produce similarly small-sized, quickly flowering plants, but they ought to have a larger THC concentration than their autoflowering counterparts. THC content is still a matter of debate between autoflowering cannabis proponents and detractors.

Autoflowering strains **seem** more user-friendly for new growers because of the absence of light-cycle decisions. This is a sort of fallacy, as new growers tend also to abuse plants more than seasoned growers. Autoflowering strains will enter flowering (the most delicate stage of growth) regardless of their health. Photoperiod growers have the choice of entering the flowering period whenever they choose, allowing them to choose this when their plants are healthiest, as well as allowing for more vegetative time for their plants to recover from earlier mistakes. Autoflowering strains will enter the flowering stage in stressed or unhealthy states automatically, which can limit bud yields.

Autoflowering cannabis cannot be cloned in the traditional sense. That is, autoflowering cannabis will always retain its 'internal flowering timer.'  If you make a cut of autoflowering cannabis, it can potentially root and create an independent plant, however, this clone will still have the internal clock set to the same automatic flowering clock as its mother. The clone and mother will still flower at the same amount of time after the original seed they both came from was germinated. Given that autoflowering strains have a very short vegetation cycle, it is debatable whether or not you'd gain a larger yield from making a lot of small flowered clones from one auto or if you let the auto vegetate and flower into one large plant. Along the same lines, the limited vegetative cycle does not allow for very much drastic growth techniques like topping and super cropping, as the plant doesn't have a lot of time to recover from these before it flowers.

Autoflowering cannabis can be grown outdoors any time of year (assuming it has a reasonable, stable environment in terms of temperature, etc), since it will flower with any light cycle. Autoflowering cannabis can be grown outdoors in conjunction with photoperiod cannabis to harvest twice in a summer season; once quickly from the autoflowering, and later a second harvest from the photoperiod cannabis.

Autoflowering cannabis is thought to be best grown in anything between a 18/6 and 20/4 light cycle, as it gets a lot of light, but also has time to recover in darkness. It can, however, be grown in 12/12 permanently or 24/0 permanently.

I'm not sure if too many of you remember but these are the people who have scammed numerous growers on forums such as grasscity, icmag, 420mag and a simple google search of ""ledgirl"" will show the history of it. I remember S.A.G. specifically calling them out on their bullshit. 

Please if the employees at your Hydro store recommend this, politely inform them that they are a bunch of greedy fucking idiots who don't know shit about their own product. 

Just to give you a taste they sell a 36W LED light for $250. Please re-spread the word.

for instance, last night i realized that buying PH down was a waste of money because i could buy phosphoric acid on amazon for less and then dilute it.  

a few months ago i realized that [these](http://www.growlightexpress.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=1563&amp;cPath=50#googlebase) were a ripoff because you can literally get [two of the exact same thing](http://www.soap.com/p/glade-automatic-spray-starter-kit-clean-linen-62-oz-2-pack-216471?site=CA&amp;utm_source=Google&amp;utm_medium=cpc_S&amp;utm_term=ASJ-267B&amp;utm_campaign=GoogleAW&amp;CAWELAID=1323109795&amp;utm_content=pla&amp;adtype=pla&amp;cagpspn=pla) for that price.  

Also, most clone buckets you order online, there's another mistake I made.  If you buy the individual parts (pump, bucket, lid, neoprene inserts) from amazon or home depot it would cost half as much.

Any other stuff you realized was pure marketing that you were wasting your money on?   ",,False,,t5_2s5jo,False,,red-cross,True,t3_176vi0,http://www.reddit.com/r/microgrowery/comments/176vi0/what_are_your_frugal_grow_hacks/,

**Setup:**

400w MH/HPS 6"" cooltube

3'x1.7'x5' tent

195CFM 4"" inline fan/filter

FFOF soil, FF Trio nutes

3 Gallon buckets

Strains: Northern Lights x Skunk, Cheese, Pineapple Express

**Results:**

Cheese: 58g

Northern Lights: a very dense 62g

Pineapple Express: 92g

Total: 212g, just over .5g/watt! :)

[In jars, starting the cure](http://i.imgur.com/Ud5NRFu.jpg)

They've been curing at a steady humidity (60 for P.Exp., 65 for the other 2) for about 3 months now.  I plan on just keeping them in the jars and burping once/twice a week. The smoke is ever so smooth, and this is wonderful stuff when compared to what I had before.  

All thanks to /r/microgrowery and its community!

On a more serious note: 

The main reason I did this is for my wife. Unfortunately she suffers from fibromyalgia, and if any of you know people that have this syndrome it can be brutal.  So far, no medicine has helped, so I did this mainly so she could try some high(er) quality, natural remedies (no medical in this state).  So far it does appear to lessen the pain quite well.  So for her sake, I give this community my absolute sincere gratitude.

There's no problem with asking for help, but we have links that help with almost all problems.

Biggest things that need to be addressed, and maybe even sidebar linked. 

Soil. I see so many people using wood chips or mulch etc. 

Nutrient charts. You have the nutes, but do you know what to do with them?


Cleanliness... I hear you have bugs? There's only one way that bug got in there... You! Let's talk about sanitization and grow room attire. 

Safety. Electricity above the plants, water below. Wearing sunglasses, night time working. 

I grow medicinally, legally, sanitary and safely. I just want to help the people who are having issues, and help them figure out why it's happening.

[Mambas just before harvest](http://i.imgur.com/jqKGR.jpg)

[I do not trim the plants until they are dry](http://i.imgur.com/fj0nb.jpg).  In my experience and practice I have not gotten the flavor nor aromas I am seeking when I trim the plants wet.  Jorge describes the practice very very well in his book.

""When you cut a plant and hang to dry, the transport of fluids within the plant continues, but at a much slower rate. Stomata close soon after harvest, and drying is slowed since little water vapor escapes. The natural plant processes slowly come to an end as the plant dries. The outer cells are the first to dry, but fluid still moves from the internal cells to supply moisture to outer cells which are dry. When this process occurs properly, plants dry evenly throughout. Removing leaves and large stems upon harvest speeds up drying; however, moisture content within the ""dried"" buds, leaves and stems is uneven. If buds are dried too quickly, chlorophyll and other pigments, starch and nitrates are trapped within plant tissue, making it taste green, burn unevenly and taste bad.

When dried relatively slowly, over a period of seven days or longer, moisture evaporates evenly in to the air, yielding uniformly dried buds. Slowly dried buds taste sweet and smoke smooth. Taste and aroma improve when pigments breakdown. Slow even drying where moisture content is the same throughout stems, foliage and buds allows enough time for the pigments to degrade. Hanging entire plants to dry allows this process to take place over time.""

We all know chopped up buds, smell more.  When you crumble a nug or break it open, or squeeze it you can smell it much better, right?  Well that's what happens when you trim.  I have found that trimming the bud, and then allowing it to dry results in the aromas dissipating into the air and leaving the buds, so that when you come back to jar them they do not smell as sweet.  However if you wait and trim at the end of the drying process, you are able to jar up the flowers immediately after working with them.  This contains the smell in the jar and allows them to bask in their flavors indefinitely.  Keeping the leaves on, as Jorge describes also allows for the moisture to escape as evenly as possible.  [The buds do not come out of the jar soft or squishy, they are rock hard and finished.](http://i.imgur.com/EAieA.jpg)

[Buds to be trimmed.](http://i.imgur.com/ZmCcQ.jpg)

[Scale is calibrated.](http://i.imgur.com/696bq.jpg)

[Nice tops when finished up](http://i.imgur.com/PPQvf.jpg)

[Quality definitely not lacking](http://i.imgur.com/AVo8v.jpg)

[A few jars finished up](http://i.imgur.com/Jl5i4.jpg)  Each jar holds about 4 oz when filled up like this and with the plants being fully dry before trim there's no chance of mold in the jars.  The finished moisture content is usually between 11%-13%.

I wish I could have a picture of all the product finished and together but it's a very hot commodity and is gone before it has a chance to sit around.  I grew 6 White Fire OG and those came to 3.1 lbs.  And 14 Mambas came to 7.5 lbs giving me a total of 10.6 lbs from 20 plants and 6,000 watts.  Which equals just over 8 oz per plant and slightly under 2 lbs per light.  Comes to a grand total of .79 grams per watt which is just under what I've been shooting for.

-CAP PPM Fuzzy Logic CO2 Controller
-5 Lb CO2 Bottle with Solenoid

-Condensate Collection coated with NeverWet
-7X 240 watt Power Supplies 
-Thermal Cutoff Switches in all compartments for over temperature protection 

I went crazy on this one and I hope it works.  It seems to maintain 85 degrees okay with both lights on, but won't get any cooler at current conditions.  With both lights off it will cool down to 65 after 6 hours.  All together it uses 1000 watts when running the way it is now.

I was pretty diligent about keeping the canopy as even as I could and within a few inches from the bulbs. After the uproot, I let her hang [upside down](http://i.imgur.com/c7ujfP4.jpg) for a week to [dry out](http://i.imgur.com/JOWDRAz.jpg) nice and slow. There was a total of 38 [branches](http://i.imgur.com/hy9c8HO.jpg) so I just clipped them all off, [piled them up](http://i.imgur.com/Nomww71.jpg) and got down and dirty with [the trim job](http://i.imgur.com/lun0Dq0.jpg) that took about an hour. The [nugs](http://i.imgur.com/xlGSqXl.jpg) varied in [size](http://i.imgur.com/8OcDilk.jpg) between 1.5-2.5 grams each. Along with a bunch of popcorn buds, the total weight came to [76.4 grams.](http://i.imgur.com/MpPNFWC.jpg) I expect to still lose a little more moisture weight but not much. I definitely made it my 2 oz goal this time. Each of my grows have shown significant improvement. 

[First grow](http://i.imgur.com/i9ntt.jpg)

[ Second grow](http://imgur.com/ARZrb)

[Third  Grow](http://i.imgur.com/2aj2VHd.jpg)

Here's a link to my [dresser grow box](http://www.reddit.com/r/microgrowery/comments/11emq6/ghettobox_upgrade_cfl/) that was pretty inexpensive to make. 

I started with a 1/2 gallon sized pot, then transplanted to 2.5 and ended up in big 5 gallon pot.
Using the old faithful Fox Farms Ocean Forest mixed with some extra perlite. Earth Juice: Verde Fire powder nutrients for grow and bloom added every other watering. 

For training, I topped the clone after a couple days and leaned her to the side. I topped all of those side shoots that came up,  and then each of those new shoots again after a couple nodes. Low stressed trained the hell out of them, without supercropping, to grow out first and then upward. Here's a nice shot of her [legs](http://i.imgur.com/CvQix.jpg).

Update: 
Making the sidebar image is the greatest moment in my Internet life. Thanks hsi__!

Pics in comments,LoggerheadToker,65,5,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/microgrowery/comments/1ip61r/1st_grow_day_80_pineapple_express_autos_yes_the/,"My story, many months ago I got really really drunk to build up the courage to order seeds from Attitude.  I was really nervous to order with my CC and to have them delivered to my residence.  Turns out that was the easiest part of this trip, no problems at all with delivery.  Used guarantee + stealth. 

My Grow

**Strain:**  Barneys Farm Pineapple Express Autos

**Grow medium:**  Home grown compost along with this [recipe](http://www.reddit.com/r/microgrowery/comments/17wzu0/an_easy_organic_indoor_mix/) found on mg.  I'm not sure my compost was done when i first used it as i had fungus gnats from the start.  Used gnatrol and that took care of the problem in no time.
 
**Light size &amp; type:** 250watt HPS w/ bat wing reflector.  Unfortunately this was all my little tent can handle.  I would love to go bigger, just can't with my stealth requirement.

**Nutrient and schedule:** Easily the area I screwed up the most on.  Best lesson learned was, listen to your plant not the breeders harvest schedule.  Used General Organics GoBox.  Ended up flushing Day 55, which was way way way too early.  I think my buds suffered from this as Stretch is very fluffy and airy.  But hey, it's my own fluffy airy buds, so I'm still proud.

**Watering schedule:**  Used distilled water following a Feed, Nothing, Water, Nothing, Feed cycle.

**Pictures:** [imgur](http://imgur.com/a/c3juX)

Lastly thanks to everyone for being awesome!  your posts and comments helped tremendously.  Can't wait to start up again once the worst of the heat is over with.  Next grow will be Blue Cheese!!

EDIT: formatting.  Also, fave part of this grow.  Come home from work one day, SO says to me ""It F*!#ing Stinks!  Do something about it!""  I can not recommend ona block, did not work at all.  Best smell deterrent was ona gel inside a coffee can with a PC fan blowing on top.

They're taking comments at rules@liq.wa.gov - here are a few of my thoughts - what do you think, MG?

Producer rules for I-502 should, at a minimum, explicitly specify:

1. What zones (agricultural, industrial, commercial) marijuana can be produced.
2. What number of plants can be grown simultaneously by a producer.
3. The definition of ""plant"" for number two above.  Should seedlings and/or non-rooted clones be considered against the count of plants?  These ""infant"" plants often fail before viability, and setting limits too low that include seedlings and clones will have a dramatic impact on the viability of a business.  A business simply won't be able to produce enough product to be profitable.
4. Can a producer sell ""raw"" (unprocessed) cannabis directly to a retailer under a producer license, or would the producer be required to be a licensed processor as well?

If you are a WA grower and have questions you want to be addressed in the rule making, now is the time to speak up.

**EDIT:** If you have any thoughts about what the rules should say *regardless of where you live*, please post your comments here.  I would love to know what the rest of you think, and I'm happy to submit more emails to the LCB on our behalf as a community.

We all have a right to post pics, get advice, talk shop, rant, rave etc but trying to give away/selling cuts/clones/plants, seeds, trying to score some pot here (I've seen this) etc will either bring in the feds or bring in the wrath of Condi Naste/Advance Publications, the owners of Reddit. Either way, this sub-reddit will get shut down if there's any sort of this style of illegal activity.

Even if you have a medical license to grow, please, don't try any of the above.

In conclusion, to leave on a positive note, here's a pic of a [Big Bud](http://i.imgur.com/baXFP.jpg) plant that's part of my legal medical garden using the low stress training technique.

Fast forward to today, my mother comes over to check my new apartment out. She went shopping and got me a bunch of necessities, razors, toilet paper and food. Was really awesome. She played with my kitten a bit and then checked out the bathroom. She then made her way over to the closet and opened the one side. She made a comments on how I had a lot of room on the one side for clothes to hang.. AND THEN... Pointed at my tent which had an open vent and light shining out with green leaves smooched against it and said ""WHATS THIS?"".. I think i mumbled something about extra storage and she said ""your growing marijuana.."" hung her head in what only could be disappointment. It was so awkward. 

I gave her a hug and told her I was sorry and it was gonna be okay. She asked if i was selling it and I told her the rules. I said dont tell dad and she said she wouldnt. 

She actually took it pretty well but I think she was shocked. I figured since she already knew I would show them to her which I did. She didn't want to smell them.. Lol.. 

Now just me and my mother know what I do. Kinda crazy. I told her not to tell anyone and she promised she wouldn't.

There was a thread about a month ago asking the people on /mg how they've stayed stealth so long and I made a post that got upvoted pretty high, so I thought maybe I should post this as an own submission so /u/hsi__ can link it in the sidebar or the beginners guide. Bear with my errors, english isn't my native language and I'm probably not that good.

Try to find a middle course between paranoia and safety or it'll eat you up. You're going to grow cannabis, not building a bomb(if you're doing both, scratch one, see below (-; ).

###General tips*(you should follow them regardless of growing or not)*

Rule of thumb: Never have more than one illegal hobby. Your illegal hobby is growing right now, so leave it at that(scratch those bombing plans, mate). Stop driving around stoned or drunk(you shouldn't do that regardless of growing, but that's another story), stop torrenting a metric shitton of movies(get netflix maybe?), don't build your own explosives, don't cheat on your partner(that's one of the more important ones, revenge is fucked up). If you're living in an apartement, don't smoke in there, unless you really, *really* know you neighbours don't give a fuck. One smell complain can fuck you over. Take your dog for a walk and smoke one or get a vape, they smell less. Same goes for partying. You don't wanna have police knocking on your doors because you've been partying too loud.

Don't look like a fucking stoner. *I can't stress this enough.* You don't need to look like a comical version of a hyperstereotyped stoner. You're not a rastafari(most probably, ofc), you don't need to wear green, red and yellow all day long. Stop telling everyone you ever meet about how cannabis is sent from god and is so great. In short: Stop looking and behaving like you're a regular on r/trees. Weed doesn't dictate your life, so lean back for a moment and relax. There are other nice things in life. Maybe stop toking for a month and get a grip on things before considering to grow weed if this description seems to fit on you. Never let the addiction overrule you.

Police does not look for people that seem like life has worked out for them. As sad as it makes me, police is looking for either people of color(no matter how well they're dressed, no matter where on the planet you are, most of the police will always be that little bit extra-racist, just keep that in mind) or people that look sketchy as fuck. Wearing that Bob Marley t-shirt while having rastas will make you a target. I've seen enough people getting searched for their looks, so don't ever think you're an exception. Always be nicely groomed, greet your neighbors, don't be rude. You're not required to make breakfast for your neighbors, but just try to be nice and tidy and look like it. Don't shun them.

Read up about your rights. I recommend this to everyone, regardless of their hobby. It's important to know what police is allowed to do and what not. Read up about implied consent and how to refuse a cops' request polite but stern. Doing this in reality is the hard part, so try acting in front of a mirror a few times and try to look for youtube videos of people in your country using their rights. Most of them appear to be assholes(I'm sorry, but it's true), but if it works for you, who fucking cares. Don't just skim a few texts, really read them. **Learn** them, learn your rights. This is more important than knowing how to grow. Fucking up your first grow feels bad, but you can just start over. Giving a cop implied consent to search your car or your body cavities even though you're transporting your grow equipment will not just feel bad, but may render you unable to ever start over from the beginning(depending on the country you're from, of course). Read up about how search warrents work and how to interact with police once they have one for your home. Read up about what you're allowed to say to police and what not(I'll give you a little hint here: Don't say **anything** without a lawyer).

Never trust a junky. They're all the same, there are no exceptions. Don't listen to their excuses.

Don't leave your flat/house while your washing machine/dish washer is working. If it breaks down and causes a leak, a janitor may try to get into your flat to repair whatever it is that leaks. Never keep the oven on while being outside your flat, not even for 10 minutes.

Don't start cooking while seriously high/drunk. We all know somebody that suddenly fell asleep and nearly caused a fire bad enough to burn everything down.

Don't tell anyone you're growing. This has a few restrictions, of course: If you're one of those youngings living with your parents, talk to them. Multiple reasons: First off, if you're getting caught, you fuck up your parents life, too. They have a right to know about what happens in their house. Secondly: It's nearly impossible to grow in the same house as your parents undetected. They're going to find out about what you're doing sooner or later anyway. If your parents do not approve of cannabis, don't smoke in their home, don't grow in their home. Show some damn respect, son!(I'm sorry, always wanted to say that once, haha).

If you have a partner living with you: Talk to them about it. Don't surprise them, they may not be comfortable with it. If your partner isn't comfortable with you growing, don't grow(or aquire new partner). Before telling your partner or considering to grow in your own home: What happens when you two break up? Will your partner trashtalk you and use your grow to blackmail you, or will s/he even go straight to police after a breakup? If you have a partner living in their own appartement, it's up to you to decide if you're trusting them enough to let them see your grow. Personally, I'd say, if you don't trust them moving into your house/appartement, you shouldn't trust them into your growroom. You shouldn't even tell your friends.

Don't grow ridiculous amounts. Unless you're going to sell it, you don't need 50oz every 3 months, so keep it down a notch and be reasonable.

#All of the above tips are equally important. Try to follow of much of them as possible.

### Internet/Computer

While(if!) posting online, use proxies, or better yet, internetcafes and proxies together. Tor is a pretty solid choice and let's you install a portable version on a flash drive. You can also alyways think about getting prepaidcards for internetservices in foreign countries if that's suitable for your situation.

Clear all the exifs of your images(even when uploading to imgur). Exifs store informations such as date taken, thumbnails, owner of the cam(if your cam has that feature and you're actively using it). Blur/censor *everything* in your pictures that's not the growbox, the plants or tools used for the plants. Fingers, hair, your floor, everything that can be used to identify you as a person. Always clear Exifs after editing your images, so the thumbnail of the original file gets deleted(you may have edited yourself out in the big picture, but programs like paint sometimes don't save a new thumbnail, so you can still get recognized there).

Don't use your smartphone to post. Don't even use it to look up posts in a growing related board.
Always use truecrypt with a secure and very long password for all of your harddisks. If you have an old laptop somewhere, use that thing for everything related to growing. If the worst case ever happens, you can hide/destroy it. Even if it's found, truecrypt isn't able to be ""hacked"" open by the police, so it's relatively safe.

#When online, never **ever** use your mainaccount for growing related stuff.  Use a special account for growing subreddits. When on dedicated growing boards, use a complete new online persona. Try taking a name that isn't easily searchable via Google. Take a often used word, a celebrity, something well known with lots of google results. Bonuspoints if your way of writing/vocabular differs greatly from your mainaccount(e.g. smileys can make one hell of a difference. Someone using "":-)"" seems like an older person, whereas someone using (: may seem pretty young).

###Equipment/electricity

The right tools are always important. Don't, DON'T, really ***DON'T*** buy cheap stuff when it comes to your growing equipment. Cheap fans can always stop working when you're at work or on vacation. Shit will smell like a motherfucker. Cheap ballasts may short and start a fire. You don't wanna be that guy that lost his house to a fire AND goes to prison because of growing weed. Same goes for cheap lights.

Always follow a few simple rules: Electricity up top, water down bottom. Never store your electricity related stuff next to or even directly above/beneath water. Bad grower, bad!

Try to have a second filter handy after your first or second(or maybe third) grow. Your first filter will die down eventually, and although you can refill it yourself, you're better off having a second one handy, so you can easily switch before anyone outside your own apartment/house can smell anything. You can refill them perpetuating.

#Don't haul lights or soil or anything related to growing over to your house in plain sight. Use boxes or whatever. Bonuspoints if you can write something on it to make it seem like a different thing(""[New girlfriends'] winterclothes"" or whatever, make it seem believable).

###Your living and growing rooms

First things first: *Change your locks!* ... no really, change them, I'm not kidding. I don't care if it's expensive or if you're technically not allowed to, just do it. As long as you're renting or bought a house from someone else, you never know if there's anyone having a key for your door. Shell out those $70 to get a new lock for your door. It's cheap compared to the cost of a lawyer in case someone discovers your little growery.

Don't leave anything lying around in your apartement/house where a guest can easily see it. Books about growing? Put them away, preferrably somewhere where nobody but you can access them. So if you're like me and like reading on the toilet, take it with you after you're done. Don't let it lie there for everyone to see. You might think ""I don't have any guests around!"", but what about a sudden surprise visit by your parents or a neighbor that really needs to use your toilet because he lost the keys for his own door?

If you have a seperate room for growing, always keep it locked, take the key with you. If someone ever enters your house without you there/knowing, they can't access the growroom. If you're growing in your bed room, always lock that, especially when you have guests over(you never know what people are up to when you're at the toilet!). If there's a window in your growroom, there are multiple steps to consider. Add window blinds, then plywood sheets. If you're going to use your plywood sheets to channel your exhaust outside, always check for noise, use mufflers and lots of insulation. Think about getting accoustic foam, it's cheap and effective.

People using a selfmade box/cupboard or a tent in their bedroom: Always shut your blinds and turn on the lights in your room before accessing your box. I made a testrun with my SO: If she was opening the growbox with blinds down and lights off, it looked like burglars were running through my bedroom using flashlights. That may attract police.

You don't wanna be growing out in a shack or your (non-attached) garage. You don't have enough control over these places and they're not isolated enough.

Next thing: Try to get infos on helicopters with IR/heat sensors or so-called [cannachoppers](http://www.cannachopper.com/)(small drones with sensors for cannabis/heat). Try growing in your basement(given that you're living in your own house), they can't pick up heatsignatures there as good as in your attic.

If you're living in an apartement complex, don't store anything related to growing in spaces where other people can see them. That includes boxes and soil. If you have a basement that's not tightly secured, don't store anything in there. They're often targets of burglars. If police comes around to investigate, they shouldn't be able to see anything. Ideally you should store boxes in a locked room, maybe in the same room your growtent/equip is in. Same goes for most other things. Don't keep anything weed/growing related in plain sight. Lock everything in a safe room only you have access to.

Cut down on parties or meet-ups/get-togethers(or however you wanna call it) in your house/apartement(but don't keep everyone out forever, that makes you sketchy). Less (intoxicated) people in your living space means less likelyhood of having them stumble into your growing room or asking stupid questions about that door you always keep locked. You can achieve this by prohibiting people from smoking indoors, or simply just say your neighbours complained about noise a few times in the past times. Have some people over sometimes, though, in a thoroughly cleaned house. It's best to clean your flat, go to sleep, and look again before having people over. Your chances are higher to catch everything growing related that way.

#If you have friends that smoke weed, always remember they don't know you're growing. Don't start rambling about how you could never imagine smoking from a dealer again, or tell someone what shitty weed he just brought into your house. Always have a small stash for public display.

###Waste

Never put your weed or cuttings in the same garbagebag as your usual trash. Put them in a nice little small bag, preferrably black/dark and dispose of that bag somewhere else. **DON'T** put anything in there that could point to you. No checks, bills, pictures or whatever. JUST soil and weedcuttings/stems. Either take it to an industrial place, throw it away behind a flower shop or into the woods. Always chop it down before throwing it away. If you have a compost, put it in there when nobody is looking(not deep at night, though. People composting at night are sketchy as fuck). You can also flush it down your toilet(not all at once!) if you only have a few plants. If you're living in a big complex and there are huge trashbins for everyone, you can put it in there. Think about wearing gloves if you *really* want to be on the safe side(although that's not really reasonable, especially not if you're living in a hot place).

#Don't throw your equipment into your normal trash, either. Bring your filters and lights to recycling depots or go bury it in the woods(you shouldn't do that, though, nature and stuff). If you fear that stuff getting recognized, deform it with a hammer or a big stone. They're not gonna check if you used it for growing, seriously. Be responsible and recycle, please.

To summarize all of the above: Don't sell, don't smell, don't tell. Also don't build bombs.

#Add a big(like, *really* big) portion of luck and you're good to go, little duckling.

Just wanted to get some advice from long-time growers (eldertrees) about how to keep your indoor garden going without raising suspicion. Mine is ~18 plants under HIDs in the suburbs. It's my third grow and by far the most ambitious. 

I saw a comment a few days ago from someone who claimed to be a 10+ year grower for mmj. Respect. 

I know the basics: carbon filter for odor, anticipated electricity spikes on bill and have an alibi/just don't steal the electricity, and TELL NO ONE. But what I'm looking for is some ""inside baseball"" stuff; tips and tricks that you seasoned vets can impart to the younger growers. Your experiences ARE appreciated. 

EDIT 1: Sum of the major points: don't tell, don't smell, don't sell

1319737673.0,51,self.microgrowery,lr6re,Ripped off... :(,wefandangrow,58,7,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/microgrowery/comments/lr6re/ripped_off/,"So on Monday I got home to find my front door wide open.  I saw a pile of soil on my living room carpet.  I immediately knew something bad had happened.  I ran to my room to find my tent unzipped and my two plants closest to harvest missing (a beautiful blue cheese and jock horror, the biggest, best looking plants I've ever grown).  There was soil and coco everywhere on the ground and all my dresser drawers had been rummaged through.  They didn't even take the oz. of curing meds that was on the shelf in my room.  

Beyond that, my laptop and my roommate's laptop were stolen, along with some cash out of my roommate's bedroom.  

It took me a while to decide whether to report the incident to the police.  I am abiding by my state's medical law to the best of my knowledge but I have heard of people having trouble with LEOs recently even if they are fully legal.  

When I finally got the balls to report it, I decided not to mention anything about the garden but to still report the missing electronics.  My scent control is very good (2 Ona Mist dispensers, one right outside the tent and one in the hallway outside the room) so both cops (one a crime scene tech) that came over to file the report didn't notice anything.  

The comforting thing, I guess, was that the officers informed me that I was third in a string of break-ins in this neighborhood in the past two months and that the other two were similar incidents where suspects came to the front door under a guise (in one of the other cases, pretending to be looking for a lost dog) and if they determined nobody was home, they'd go around back and try to gain entry through a side door or window.  They got into my house by prying off the screen door of a bathroom window and jimmying the window open with a large flathead screwdriver with enough force to break the window lock.  The nature of the crime suggests that it was completely random and not targeted at my grow - if they knew that they were going to come across my grow it seems they would have at least brought a scissors or something, instead of ripping plants out by the roots and spilling dirt everywhere.  The soil on the main floor suggested they panicked while figuring out how to stash this plant in a backpack or something and shook out as much dirt as they could from the root ball.  

Anyway, I am just in a weird state ever since this has happened; can't sleep or eat well, can't focus at work, etc.  Even though it appears to just be a random 'case the joint for when nobody's home and get in and out' kind of thing, I can't help but be nervous for my grow now that somebody out there with malicious intent knows that it's there.  Part of me is considering selling off my current plants to other local Caregivers and laying low for a while.  I really don't know.

Let's get right to it. Last night, I picked up some very wonderful looking buds from a local delivery clinic (SoCal MMJ). Now, these buds are frosty, delicious, amazing, and oh my, they are so DENSE! What makes these buds so damn dense? 

Well.... when I looked closer with my jeweler's loup, it looked to me like these buds had been pollinated. That's right, POLINATED! This is some 24% and higher THC medical marijuana and you are telling me that these buds have seeds?

No..... not quite seeds. I peeled open some of the buds and noticed seeds beginning to grow, but they were mostly still green. However they did not seem to contain much if any THC. 

MY THEORY: Growers are pollinating their buds a week or two before harvesting. They start to produce seeds, but before they grow much past dense little green blobs, the grower harvests the crop. The buds are insanely dense, but there is no mistaking that the density is only because of pre-seeds.

Turned down my road only to find a couple police cars heading in the other direction, one of which was backing out of my driveway! Needless to say, my heart stopped. Turns out they were dealing with a loose dog that they found at my neighbor's house. 

This isn't the 1st scare I've had, and surely won't be the last. But it made me want to reexamine the way I do things. I want to make sure I'm not slipping. After you do something for a while with no consequence, you tend to get complacent. Human nature I guess. 

So, r/microgrowery, I wanted to post my rules of conduct and ask for your input. Let me know if I'm missing something. There's no such thing as being too careful when it comes to such matters. Obviously, this applies to non MJ friendly states. 

1. Never tell anyone. That one's pretty obvious.

2. Keep it inside. Tempted to put a plant on the back patio to get some rays? Not a good move. 

3. Do it in the dark. If you have to move growing supplies or plants from a garage/shed/car to the house or vice versa, do it under the veil of darkness. 

4. Do the occasional walkaround. Every so often, walk around the property to make sure there is no noticeable smell or light escaping. 

5. Keep it out of the trash, and out of sight. Don't throw stems in the garbage. Don't have visible leaves poking out of the compost pile. Don't dry your buds on the back porch.

6. Keep it locked. Fence gates, shed doors, closet doors, windows. A curious child can screw you just as bad as a cop. Keep em out. 

7. Stay low key. It may be unfortunate, but when you are growing you lose the ability to attract any attention to your property. Shooting illegal fireworks, having massive bonfires, loud barking dogs, stinky trash, etc is no good. Any set of eyeballs fixed on your property is a potential jail sentence. 

8. Keep it otherwise legal. No stealing electricity. No bringing whores to your house. 

9. SAFETY IS PRIORITY #1! If your house burns down because of a grow, nothing else matters. You lose your home, your freedom, and of course your grow. 

10. Know your legal rights.

11. Be a good neighbor. You should be one anyway. But this is *especially* true when you have a special garden.

Ok, so what'd I miss? I want to make sure I'm staying on top of things.

Since then everything has been going great, and my ladies are loving it!

However, the one problem I had, which defeated the stealth aspect of the box, was the noise pollution I was getting from my inline fan. After doing some research, I determined it was caused by the low-cost [Speedster fan speed controller](http://www.amazon.com/SE-Electronic-Stepless-Speed-Controller/dp/B000HQAVNI) I purchased. It caused a very audible humming sound, causing my grow box to sound like a fridge. This is because the Speedster, and other low cost fan speed controllers, operate by interrupting the voltage multiple times per second. As a result, the fan never gets out of the initial startup ""humm"" phase.

I've since replaced it with a [Variac variable transformer](http://www.amazon.com/Variac-Variable-Transformer-300va-Output/dp/B006NGI8VS), which adjusts the voltage while still keeping a constant flow. The sound difference has been absolutely amazing.

[Here's a video I made comparing the two to give you an idea of the difference.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABF8YhWGi60&amp;feature=youtu.be)

As you can see (hear?), the variable controller made things significantly more quiet, thus making it exponentially more stealthy. It cost a bit more ($65 versus $20), but I'd say it was well worth it.

I cant say this will be an end all solution because it does take a bit of creativity but hopefully this guide will let you know what you are in for and give you the motivation.

Materials you need:

4 5 gallon buckets

1 LED UFO with a diameter less that that of buckets. My buckets are roughly 12"" so I purchased one that was 11"" to allow airflow.[this is mine](http://www.amazon.com/Light-Lighthouse-Hydro-BlackStar-Flowering/dp/B00725XHP6)

6 eye bolts (Home Depot)

3 Bolts and washers that will take the place of your UFO's supplied mounting loops (home Depot)
Flat white paint (Home Depot)

3 2"" PVC drain covers (Home Depot)

Filter screen (Aquarium Store)

Activated carbon (Aquarium Store)

Foam or something to seal the lid of the bucket (LED came packed in it)

Tools:
Jig saw
Drill



Step 1: The Bucket
cut 5"" off the bottom of three of the buckets and paint the inside white.

http://i.imgur.com/ocjaV.jpg
http://i.imgur.com/JN5fG.jpg

save one of the bottoms to make a pot holder
cut the bottom like so and drill holes for airflow

http://i.imgur.com/antg5.jpg

Remember the holder needs to be cut to the size of the pot you are using
I put six eyelet bolts around the bottom for LST and also so you can tie something to it to pull your plant and the pot holder from the bucket.

Drill holes in the bottom of the bucket for air to come in. You're going to need a lot. the three fans on the back of my UFO suck a lot of air and I kept drilling holes until the change in airflow off the bucket and on the bucket wasn't as noticeable.

http://i.imgur.com/PZ2W6.jpg



Step 2: The Light
Ok this part is a little more intensive but not hard.

Remove the LED panel and cover of your UFO. You should be left with the fans and the power supplies for the LED panel. 

http://i.imgur.com/FIGwD.jpg

REMEMBER TO MARK YOUR WIRES. I had two separate connectors, don't know if it matters but better safe than sorry.

Your going to need to remove the little bolts that are supplied to hang the light and replace them with longer plain bolts. 
I also had to reverse my fans to push air out the top rather than pull it in. Just flip your fans over. 

While you have the bolts out and the fans off use the housing as a stencil mark a piece of foam going between your lid and light. Also use it to mark the lid of your bucket. I didn't do it this way and you will see the consequences. 
I used the foam that was used to pack the LED.

http://i.imgur.com/zPqNF.jpg

Don't forget to mark the hole for the plug. I forgot to the first time and it isn't pictured here.

Cut the foam and the lid of the bucket with your jig saw. Drill the holes for the new bolts.

http://i.imgur.com/RGdQT.jpg
http://i.imgur.com/l8KTR.jpg
http://i.imgur.com/Jr45q.jpg

See no hole for power cord. 
I fixed it. lol

http://i.imgur.com/W6NgZ.jpg



Step 3: The filters
Use your PVC drain covers to trace 6 circles on the filter screen and cut them out. 

http://i.imgur.com/kD2cR.jpg
http://i.imgur.com/veSur.jpg

Now you're going to take your pvc drain covers and put them between the foam and the back of your light. 

http://i.imgur.com/bm3TN.jpg

It should look like so.

http://i.imgur.com/OiA5z.jpg

After you have put the filters through the foam and the lid you need to attach the UFO to the lid using the holes for the old mounting hardware and the ones you traced and drilled on your lid. 
Don't over-tighten it makes it difficult to get a good seal on the lid. 

Now put the first layer of Filter screen in the bottom of the drain cover, add about 1/4 to 1/2 inch of carbon, and put the second layer of filter screen on top. 

http://i.imgur.com/E5xCA.jpg
http://i.imgur.com/1Vj6S.jpg
http://i.imgur.com/JLv4e.jpg

And here is a finished view.

http://i.imgur.com/iOaiR.jpg

Here is a view of the filters and UFO full assembled on the lid.
Without carbon yet. 

http://imgur.com/JFiBw

Completely finished

http://i.imgur.com/kf30I.jpg

and here is a pic of the temps inside and outside the bucket

http://i.imgur.com/v0SsR.jpg

I put a second lid on top of the filters to make it look less conspicuous and it raised the temps to almost 80f.

I wont be giving any feedback on the logistics of growing in this bucket because I built it for a friend but I can tell you that behind a closet door with minimal ambient noise you can neither hear nor see the lights and fans. 

I'm sorry I couldn't be more exact this is my first time building one of these and its not even for me. I just couldn't let you guys spend $400.00 on a bucket without these features.

I'm not 3m away from all this waiting to check out and pretending to look at a brochure for some nutrients.  From there, this is what I hear:

* Customer: ""Ya dude, don't even worry about it, I bought the table over at XYZ Hydroponics for $X, I don't need one anymore""
* Owner: ""From Bob over at XYZ Hydro?  Well I heard from a hommie of mine that he was crooked as shit""
* Customer (ORLY face): oh ya
* Owner: ""Ya dude, he was like helping these Mexicans with a like warehouse setup and once they figured out how to do it they told him to fuck off.  A week later the warehouse got raided""
* Customer: No shit....
* Owner: ""Ya and that isn't the first time something like this happened, he runs his mouth about....um.....like shit that could get him in trouble, you know what I mean""

At this point, anyone over the age of 16 that is standing in the store (only me and 2 other people) knows they are talking about a large scale marijuana grow.

* Customer: ""Ok then...well I need 5 bags of rock and...."" (the rest of his order)

He proceeds to whip out a Pablo Escobar sized wad of $100's, peal off the required number and stuff them back in his pockets.

If I were a cop looking for some low hanging fruit I could have EASILY followed either of the 2 people involved with that conversation around, found what I was looking for and got search warrants for whatever addresses I needed.

That plant is usually chosen at random from what I can assume is hsi_ getting blazed late at night and surfing the growporn, or something else equally believable. 


My idea is something like what many car forums do in the form of: *blank* of the week/month/year what have you. But in this case it's picture of the week/month/year etc.

we could have either a weekly, biweekly, or monthly nomination thread where we take nominees for 24 hours, the top 5 are chosen via the upvote system, and we vote on which picture we'd like to see take up residence on our front page.

Just a little idea I think to involve new members a little more and get older members to become a little more competitive in their picture taking. Because lets be honest, everyone loves staring at grow porn.

Enter the Maxsea De-shaker!!!",NintenJoo,55,7,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/microgrowery/comments/17dxlc/dont_you_hate_removing_the_shake_from_a_full/,"I got sick of trying to remove the shake at the bottom of a pound bag when prepping it for donation. I don't like to hear people complain that the pound had however many grams of shake in it. 

So I always de shake them. 

I stumbled onto a colander that was terrible for spaghetti because the holes were too big. 

So I cut the rim off and put it into a Maxsea container. 

Now I can dump in a full pound, put the lid on, and gently shake and rotate. 

Then I just dump it right back into the bag. Literally takes less than 30 seconds. 

The shake is held in the bucket under the strainer. The strainer is easy to remove and then the shake is saved for butter, etc.

A while ago I approached the wonderful mods of micro to see if we could open up [Macrogrowery](http://www.reddit.com/r/macrogrowery) to the public. The mods here were on board and i've been trying to get a plan together. Well I'm a css newb and I had some medical stuff go on and a new baby so I got busy. Anyways, it's opening up to the public as of right now, exciting right?

So, the rules for now are going to be on par with micros. The sub itself is going to be dedicated to larger grows. I'm not putting a minimum limit on the plant number so if you think it doesnt fit go ahead and message me and i'll make the decision. Don't be dicks to each other, that'll make you less welcome there than posting unrelated content in my eyes. Disagreements and good discussion will of course be encouraged because that's what we do. Outdoor grows and large grows are definitely welcome and any relevant links or guides people have on hand will be helpfull.

So I think thats it, short and sweet. If anyone knows how to do css and layout stuff pm me if you want to help, it's basically going to look like micro with maybe some tweaks. I might want another person to mod to help me as the micro mods are busy but we'll see what happens. 



NOW TO THE BIG BIG BIG RULE THAT I MADE SURE WAS GOING TO BE SEEN BY ALL. THIS SUB IS NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR MICROGROW. IT IS NOT FOR ADVANCED QUESTIONS REGARDING SMALL GROWS AND IS NOT FOR PEOPLE WHO DONT LIKE MICRO TO MOVE. EVERYONE IS WELCOME BUT WE ALL WANT BOTH SUBS TO SURVIVE AND FLOURISH. MICRO AND MACRO ARE SISTERS, LOVING ONES. DONT START SOME BS WAR BETWEEN THE TWO OR ILL SHUT IT DOWN.

Okay... now to some fun. I put together a small album of what i have going right now. Keep in mind im a poor bitch and I use a cell phone so my pics suck.

3000 watt hps flower room, co2 enrichment, Flora series nute line, Dyna-Grow ProTek, Cal-mag, liquid karma, roots excelurator and roots organics. Happy frog soil and mostly 5 gallon pots. Strains in there are gdp, blueberry, and dutch treat, maybe headband too but i got it mixed up... oh well.

1000watts of t5, mh and about to be upgraged to around 2000 watts or so for veg. Switched to coco on a little over half so well see what happens. In there I have gdp, headband, champagne, chocoloupe, blueberry, cherry  kush and one more i forgot lol. Most are gonna be moms and I have a bunch of clones for the next batch cookin.

My *updated* idea would be to distinguish these people with a special flair or different name color to show that they are trusted to consistently give helpful and accurate advice, **not to create an elite class of users**. It would be at the mod's discretion how often it was given out. Community voting or polls would add too much work for the mods who already have their hands full as well as the potential to create a circle-jerk. This would not be an award. The tag would be hard to get and easy to lose.

Keep in mind that this idea may not seem beneficial to members who have been here for a long time and know everyone's reputation or members who do extensive research and are already very knowledgeable. It is more for the benefit of new members/growers to help them distinguish the advice that they are given by credible community members. 

tl;dr - In the community, we all know a few users who's advice we have learned to trust based on their reputation for consistently giving good advice. The idea is to simply make that reputation known to new members who haven't been here long enough to know everyone's reputation.
