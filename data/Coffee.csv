You can get a cheap box of wine and it will taste alright and still get you drunk, but the flavor does not even come close to what you would get out of a fancy bottle (sorry for the crude terminology, not a wine expert here). 

Similarly, you can get pre-ground Folgers from the grocery store, throw it in your Mr. Coffee machine and get a cup of coffee that still tastes alright and will get you your caffeine fix, but the flavor of that coffee doesn't come close to what you can get out of freshly roasted, freshly ground coffee made in a french press.

This subreddit is mostly a place to talk about the latter, similar to how /r/wine probably doesn't compare flavors of franzia. I personally drink coffee because I enjoy the flavor. I don't need a caffeine fix to get me through the day, and so it is not just something to drink to give me a boost. I'm sure this is similar to how people don't drink fine wine to get drunk.

Most of the people here are here to discuss good, fresh coffee and more advanced brew methods. If you want to know what kind of K-Cups to get, you're not going to have much luck here, because most of us don't own a Keurig. Instead, get a sampler pack and try different ones to find the one you like. Isn't that a personal opinion anyway? If you go to any subreddit they will tell you about the best of things. You want a beer recommendation from /r/beer ? I can bet you that it won't be Miller Light.

1351009159.0,383,self.Coffee,11yaph,A beginner’s guide to good coffee,Pumpkinsweater,446,63,166,http://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/11yaph/a_beginners_guide_to_good_coffee/,"Despite the facts that it’s possible to buy “gourmet” coffee in almost any supermarket, and that there are cafes on almost every street corner in every city, it’s sadly true that it can still be difficult to find good coffee these days. Fortunately it’s getting easier all the time, and more and more people are getting interested in good coffee, either finding it at a good café, or making it at home. There are a lot of misconceptions and misinformation out there about, here’s some things to keep in mind if you want a great cup of coffee:

1.	Most people have never had good coffee. Most of the coffee sold, served and consumed in the US is “commodity” coffee, grown for volume, not taste. And over 90% of the coffee is incredibly, incredibly stale. Virtually 100% of the coffee in the supermarket, and restaurants, most of the coffee in cafes is stale. Even “fancy” cafes like starbucks or pete’s are serving stale coffee.
2.	Not only that, but most coffee is burnt to a crisp. This is because when you roast coffee dark, it stops tasting like coffee, and starts tasting like burnt carbohydrates, proteins and sugar. So, if you have a bunch of cheap commodity coffee and it’s going to sit in warehouses and on shelves going stale for months before it gets sold or served, might as well roast it dark so it will taste like something. But this is an incredibly generic and boring flavor, it’s the flavor of burnt toast, burnt caramel and roasted/burnt nuts. There’s nothing wrong with that, and it can be a nice compliment to the natural flavors of quality coffee, but if that’s the only thing you’re tasting in your coffee you’re missing out.
3.	Good coffee is one of the most complex, interesting and diverse things you can taste. It goes through an incredible process to turn the seeds of a tropical fruit in to the roasted beans and then brewed coffee. There are a huge number of varieties of coffee plants that are usually grown at high altitude on mountains or volcanos. The cherries are picked by hand, and processed, fermented and washed to remove the fruit and then dried.
4.	There’s so much more to roasting coffee than just light, medium or dark. The roast style has to be matched to the particular type and batch of coffee, there’s the starting temperature, and roast profile and different stages of the roast to bring out the best flavors in that coffee. Unless you want to spend years and years figuring it out, we really have to trust the roaster. They’re the ones who are visiting the plantations around the world, and picking the lots of coffee, then they have to figure out the right roast for that coffee. Two roasters can roast the same coffee, and they can both be “dark” roasts and they can taste very different. Generally though good roasters will roast lighter, so you can taste more of the coffee and less of the “roast.”
5.	Don’t think that you can’t taste good coffee, or that you won’t appreciate it, or that you don’t have a refined palate. When someone is good at “tasting” coffee (or wine or cheese, etc.) it just means that they’re good at describing what they taste. They just have a lot of experience, and can recognize and name flavors they’ve tasted before. Coffee is incredibly complex, and it can be hard to describe the dozens of flavors that can show up in a cup, but that doesn’t mean you’re not tasting or enjoying them. Anyone can tell the difference between stale coffee and fresh coffee, anyone can tell the difference between $5/lb coffee and $15/lb coffee, and if given a few different coffees from different regions of the world anyone will be able to tell you which one they like best.
6.	We have a distorted view of how much coffee should cost because the market is flooded with cheap, stale, burnt coffee that sells for $5-10/lb we think that’s normal. It’s not. Growing, picking, process, importing, roasting and brewing good coffee is a hard process, and it’s there’s lots of ways to screw it up. Paying $20/lb for good coffee is an incredible deal, that comes out at something like $1 a cup, and it represents dozens of people from all around the world, who are experts at what they do. The best coffees in the world are selling for $100-200/lb, which sounds (and is) expensive, but still comes out to $10 a cup. Think about a $10 glass of wine, for the same price you can get the best, most expensive, most exclusive cup of coffee in the world. Coffee so rare it’s only available a couple times a year at most, exists in very small quantities and is fought over at auction by people around the world.

The easiest metaphor to remember is that coffee is like bread. It’s something we all know, but that right now, in the US, most of us are buying the equivalent of stale wonder bread. And places like starbucks are selling fluffernutter sandwiches to cover up the stale burnt bread they’re making. But good coffee isn’t like the white bread sitting on the shelves at the supermarket, it’s a fresh loaf of sourdough right out of the oven at the corner bakery. And just like bread, it’s best fresh. Coffee is at its peak for a week or two at most. So, find a good local café serving the best coffee they can get their hands on, or go find a local roaster, or a roaster online and order some of the best coffee available anywhere, shipped right to your doorstep and start making the best coffee you’ve ever had.

Actually, calling them just a ""grinder manufacturer"" doesn't give them justice. After my experience I would call them relationship builders, customer service experts, technical consultants, cool ass dudes, or **Baratza** for short. 


Recently my Baratza Preciso was grinding too coarsely. After some hasty self diagnosing I decided that I needed to re-calibrate the machine. So I went on their website and looked up one of their troubleshooting manuals. I tried to follow it to the letter but I'm an idiot and accidentally tore the adjustment ring flat off the machine. 

For a split second I thought, ""No, it's ok. I can reattach that."" But then I heard that gut wrenching sound of tiny loose plastic bouncing on top of my table. 

Fuck.

In last ditch effort, I call up Baratza and got Colin. All you need to know about Colin is that he's awesome. 

After talking for five minutes we both agreed I fucked up somewhere and this whole thing was my fault. Not two seconds later he says, ""So I'm going to send you a new grinder"".

No more questions asked. Did I mention my grinder was refurbished? And now he's sending me a new one? What?

Pinch me I must be dreaming. 

Colin and I wax nostalgically about what it feels like to not have your morning coffee and then pleasantly part ways. 

Not ten minutes later I received an e-mail from Colin telling him my grinder will ship tonight and that I will find a pre-paid shipping label to send back ""my defective grinder"" (even though we all know what's really defective here...&amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;
)

Now, I'm sorry if this is a long winded but I really want r/coffee to know that Baratza is more than just a grinder manufacturer. In a world of call centers, disclaimers, and limited warranties, Baratza stands above the rest. Through their altruism and concern for the fellow coffee enthusiast they have gained a customer for life. I will never, so long as I live, purchase a grinder from another company. 

Thank you, Baratza. And thank you, Colin. 

Edit: One more thing. Colin, if you're listening. Next time I will call before I go all vigilante justice on my grinder's ass. 

Edit 2: I may have misunderstood him and may be receiving another refurb. Let it be know that I do not care either way. ",,False,,t5_2qhze,1364344289.0,,,True,t3_1b2r9w,http://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1b2r9w/this_company_has_just_earned_a_lifetime_customer/,

I decided to brew it and see. I don't have any fancy machine or anything like that, so I just brewed it in a regular coffee machine from walmart. I opened the can, and the [grounds looked pretty good](http://i.imgur.com/h9SBn33.png). Inside was a coupon, [front](http://i.imgur.com/gp2sZqN.jpg) and [back](http://i.imgur.com/Eu66Wcz.jpg). Here is the [coffee that was brewed](http://i.imgur.com/70ULf6y.jpg), pretty orange color. Sadly, it was a terrible welcome to the real world of coffee flavor. My buddy said it tasted like a bag of really burnt popcorn. I likened it to shit. I decided to add a little cream and sugar to see what happened and it turned out ok! I didn't feel like finishing it, neither did my roommates, for fear of pulling a Jones' Town. 


Thought some of you might want some closure!


Edit: I didn't realize this would gain much traction. If you want to try it I bought it at M'antiques in Dallas, tx of you live there you should stop by.

So, getting up at 3am and leaving for work at 3:30 for a couple of weeks, I didn't have much time to make or buy coffee. My co-worker drinks instant all the time and I needed some caffeine, so I asked for a scoop.

I've had instant before, but not since my Coffee Awakening™. I thought I'd hate it and would be unable to drink it. To my surprise (dismay?) I kind of liked it. It's got a certain, not unpleasant, je ne sais quoi that brewed coffee lacks. It's almost like a different drink. It's coffee, but it's not coffee.

I wouldn't drink it all the time, but once in a while -- when in a pinch, or maybe when not in a pinch, I think I'll have a cup.

After looking at the selection, it became obvious that they offered no varieties that weren't roasted and stored less than 6 months ago. Feeling dejected, I searched for the nearest coffee shop on my phone. After sifting through 20 matches for various nearby Starbucks, I came across a unfamiliar coffee shop in a local town centre.

The place was small and family owned. The owner was behind the counter, and offered me a taste of one of their varieties of coffee bean. From talking with this barista, I learned that all of their beans were roasted less than a week ago, an obvious improvement from my previous attempt. As I finished paying, he even offered a free cookie baked by his wife.

Needless to say, this experience was above and beyond any I had had at a Starbucks, and the taste was phenomenal.

I personally am the sample room manager, mainly responsible for the roasting and cupping of samples.  I'm also sitting here with my direct superior, the managing director and one of the Traders in the company.  Any questions for my Boss and I about the green coffee world? 

EDIT: We have lots of actual work to do but we'll get to all of your questions eventually, promise!

Most of my advice will be budget-adjusting.  I’m going to assume you aren’t able or willing to throw wads of cash at a hobby you’re just testing the waters with.  I’m also going to start out assuming you’re starting out with no gear and no experience of coffee that isn’t Dunkin, Timmies, and/or Folgers.  However, I ask that you don’t tune out if you’re ahead of where I start.  Just skim, we’ll be up to your speed in time.  I’ve tossed this together so that you *should* be able to get a grasp of “how to start coffee” by just reading bold bits.  Plain text is more detailed, useful information, while italicized text is me rambling about details or giving more in-depth explanations.  I’d like to think they’re interesting, but none are essential.  

Because this whole mess is *way* longer than Reddit’s character limit, I’m breaking every section into a comment, and using the following table of contents to link to each segment in case voting messes up the order.  If this is inconvenient, I’m really sorry, but I’m a loquacious man and brevity isn’t my forte.  Because I was a little dumb and posted backwards, sorting by age will give you the guide in reverse.  Oooops.

So I  decided to try a hybrid hot/cold extraction.

So I'm drinking my first milk-brewed cup now, and it's pretty fantastic. My method was to use hot milk (about 1"" in the microwave, pre-boil, pre-foam, just hot), pour over fresh grounds, then throw it in the fridge overnight (about 16 hours total), stirring once at the midpoint. I strained out the grounds and reheated in the microwave. It's incredibly rich, since it's 100% whole milk, and the extraction seems to have worked pretty well. It certainly doesn't taste weak, and it's not overly bitter, though it is a bit over-extracted. The most notable difference between this and my normal pour-over hot water extraction is that it tastes a lot smokier. Almost like it's over-extracted from a dark roast (which it's not, the beans are a medium roast done by a friend), but somehow the abundance of milk mellows it out so it's not bitter at all. Reminds me of coffee I've gotten in Cuban joints in Miami. It's not going to win any awards from coffee purists who want to extract subtle notes from the terroir of particular beans, but it's definitely a different sort of treat. Tastes like coffee ice cream base, which essentially it is.",,False,,t5_2qhze,False,,,True,t3_1i5k9u,http://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1i5k9u/1st_attempt_with_a_milkbrewed_extraction/,

He then exclaimed that it was fantastic and normally he would take both sugar and cream because he always finds coffee too bitter. I then offered him some if he would like and he turned me down. At the end of the cup he firmly exclaimed that it was the best cup of coffee he's ever had. He spent the next while asking how much my setup was, how much he would need to spend himself, where locally to buy stuff, and we also talked about different ways of brewing.

A Capresso Infinity burr grinder for $10 in perfect working order and a really old 6 cup Pezzetti moka pot for $3. The Pezzetti  was still in the box and looked like it was sitting in someone's garage for the last 20 years. See [here] (http://imgur.com/a/smZ4G). I used the rice technique that a lot of people have suggested for cleaning burr grinders and got it running perfectly. 

I'd also like to plug the gooseneck kettle from [this] (http://www.homeloo.com/shop/product_info.php?products_id=574) site, which is about half as much as the Hario Buono. 

tl;dr Go to the flea market. You don't need tons of money to get a decent coffee station in your house.

My December order was very disappointing to me, so took the time to drop them a note an explain that the coffee tasted stale and without much flavor. I immediately got a response from Meg who stated that she was sorry I was unhappy and that is was probably due to the fact I ordered a very light roast when I typically order a darker roast. She also let me know she was giving me credit for the order!

I called her today and she took the time to review my past orders, make some suggestions for my next order as well as offered to give me some samples to help me try some of their other beans! 

I'm in no way associated with them, aside from being a satisfied customer and I just wanted to give credit where credit is due!

So what a Drunken Latte Art Smackdown means is that two baristas go head to head pouring the best latte art they can, the winner goes on. The catch though is before each pour the barista has to take a shot of whiskey. If you have a steady hand and think you're up to the challenge come on down and pour. It's $5 to compete with all the cash going to the winner who will also receive the mighty golden jug and crowned the Lord of Lattes.

For those of you not feeling like picking up a jug and a shot, we'll be pouring cheap draft all night and playing a mix of soul and rock and roll.

1321383395.0,125,self.Coffee,mdd7s,I just blew my own mind. Re: French Press Water Temperatures,frikk,137,12,94,http://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/mdd7s/i_just_blew_my_own_mind_re_french_press_water/,"Hi everyone. Coffee lover here. I roast at home and generally have become quite the coffee fan over the past 3 years. I use a french press and couldn't be happier. Or so I thought.

I've always thought that my coffee palette was just weak. I mean I can definitely tell a difference between ""good"" coffee, ""decent"" coffee, and ""bad"" coffee. For example, when I brew up a fresh roasted batch of mine it tastes stronger and more pungent than Trader Joe's french roast (which is good coffee, but no frills, and what I use when I just need to make coffee the night before for my early sunrise bike rides).

Last year I went to the [Coffee Emporium](http://www.coffee-emporium.com/) in downtown Cincinnati with my wife and we hung out with the roaster. He had a scale, freshly ground freshly roasted beans, a [chemex](http://www.chemexcoffeemaker.com/) and made the best damn cup of coffee I have ever tried. It lit up parts of my nose I had no idea were capable of coffee aroma infiltration.  I have never been able to replicate that at home with my french press.

Well today I went to make a batch of coffee and I realized that my new food thermometer that I use for home brewing was sitting next to the stove. I thought to myself ""I'm going to re-investigate what it takes to make the best french press coffee"". Here's what I found (I've done this many times before):

   * Course ground coffee, use adequate amount
   * Water Temperature is crucial! 190-200F. **Boil water, wait 15-20 seconds, pour into french press**
   * Cover the top with the lid to allow steepage.
   * Stir at 1 minute
   * Plunge at 3-5 minutes depending on courseness of grind and taste.

OK so that's all good. That's how I've been making coffee (without the stirring part) for the past 3 years. It usually turns out delicious, but I always feel like I am missing part of the palette. The important part is that almost all internet resources say that waiting 15-20 seconds off the boil is ""long enough"" to drop the temperature of the water down to the desired temperature.

So today I decided to check my temperatures, and what I found shocked me! haha. As it turns out, my kettle does not drop from 212 degrees to 195F in 15-20 seconds. It took it all of 4 minutes to do so! That means that every french press I've been making has been too hot.

So, did it matter? Did my new french press coffee made at the right temperature taste different? Holy fat jesus on a bike, did it make a difference! The coffee has a full mouthfeel to it, a dank earthy aroma, and a bite of bitterness that is quickly subdued by a subtle chocolatey taste. This is a dark roasted Guatemalan bean, by the way, that I roasted two weeks ago (so it isn't even super fresh!). I've always known it to have a hint of chocolate to it, but now it's like the flavor profile has been raised out of the noise floor and into full fidelity!

I am enjoying this coffee right now and still can not get over how much more ""full"" the taste profile is. I'm so excited to go back and re-roast all of my local coffee roaster's 20 or so different beans and finally get to enjoy the subtle uniquenesses of each strain. I am due for a free pound (every 10 pounds get one free) so I'm excited to do a proper tasting of their specialty bean - either the Hawian Kona or the Jamaican Blue Mountain.

So, that's all. I just wanted to tell someone, and /r/coffee seemed like the reasonable audience.

-----

People on /r/coffee have been talking about it forever and [I have finally built a wiki page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/wiki/gear_by_price) for it but no one but me has added any gear yet. I'd really like to get your suggestions, broken up into price points, for various /r/coffee recommended gear, so please take a look at the wiki page, give it some thought and either edit page directly or post a comment in this thread. I will sort through all the comments and add it to the wiki later if you would prefer to share your recommendations here.

-----

This is the format I'd like to use for the time being unless anyone else wants to weigh in with a better idea.

* [Hario MSS-1B Mini Mill Hand Grinder](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001804CLY/) - ~$33 - Cheap alternative to an electric burr grinder. Good for people on a budget who still want the quality of burrs.

The full name of the product with a hyperlink to where you can purchase the product, the average cost of the product and a very brief description of the product. Notice the the buying link is a clean and direct amazon link http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001804CLY/ and not a tagged affiliate link. Your links have to be clean and can not be the kind that make you money if people buy through the link. Also, you must use well known and safe online retailers like Amazon.

-----

**Thanks for your time and input!**

-----

**EDIT:** Great idea ajfirecracker breaking the comments up into sections, everyone else please follow ajfirecracker's lead!

**EDIT 2:** Please don't downvote people if you disagree with their recommendations, I will be curating the list anyways, so leave a comment on why you don't think something should be included on the list, like with the Mr. Coffee Automatic Burr Mill Grinder, which I agree isn't good enough to make the cut. Of course almost anyone can go into the wiki and edit it but I'm hoping all of us will keep the recommendations on the actual wiki good so that people don't end up wasting their money. That is one of the reason's we haven't done this until now, we found it hard to justify recommending gear as moderators but I think doing it as a community is great.

Also, please format your recommendations the way I asked, I'm going to end up having to take all of these and transfer them to the wiki page, so if I have to stop to search out the buying link or edit your description down because it is way too long, it will take me extra time. Thanks!

**EDIT 3:** I have noticed that some people are editing the wiki [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/wiki/gear#wiki_coffee_gear_suggestions) instead of [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/wiki/gear_by_price). I will change the link in the original post which was pointing to the link for the 'gear by price' page and wasn't actually the gear by price page.

**Everything has been entered into the wiki with a few exceptions of gear that I know to be poor quality. Thanks for all the help with this thread! Please point people towards the wiki when they ask, ""What gear should I buy?"" :)**

1321229132.0,111,self.Coffee,mb7hj,How to make exquisite coffee with a small budget. A complete guide for a beginner.,relaximadoctor,124,13,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/mb7hj/how_to_make_exquisite_coffee_with_a_small_budget/,"To start: I am making this How To/Step by Step guide to making great coffee on a VERY limited budget. Please do not reply by saying ""OH WELL THIS WAY SUCKS, YOU NEED THIS $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ MACHINE TO PRODUCE DERP DE DERP AWESOME DERP COFFEE..SNOB"" Excuse the rant.

To Begin:

I am making this to let a complete beginner know what to purchase to create the best possible cup of coffee with a very limited budget. Buying expensive items is just not feasible. Drinking bland flavorless auto-drip coffee is also not an option.

**Coffee** ~$8.00-15.00 This is the only part of this how-to that is not exactly ""cheap"". Avoid any coffee that comes in a can, from the grocery store.  Canned coffee is most always cheap, old, full of chemicals, and when brewed with this method (or any method) will taste like someone vomited cigarette butts into a hookers mouth after burning them with a propane torch. Many people load coffee up with lots of cream and sugar to cover up the taste of awful coffee beans. You'll find by buying good quality coffee, you need less cream and sugar (or none!) to create a good taste.

If you are a complete beginner with coffee, try to find a local coffee roaster. Explain to them you are a beginner on a tight budget but would love a nice full flavored medium roast blend that you can try to see if you like it. Ask if they have any coffee on sale or discounted because the beans might be older (but still much better than anything in the store). If this is not an option, major grocery store chains sell bagged whole bean coffee that are not bad tasting such as Peet's Coffee, Caribou, or Eight O'clock roast. Eight O'Clock coffee is the most affordable bag of coffee that is semi-decent. 

**Brewing Method:** Melitta Pour over. $2.99
https://shop.melitta.com/itemdy00.asp?T1=64+007&amp;Cat=

Yes, it is plastic(BPA free). It's also only 3$ at your grocery store and is by far the most economical way to brew excellent coffee. Need the cheapest way to brew more than one cup? Buy this:
https://shop.melitta.com/itemdy00.asp?T1=64+111&amp;Cat=

**Grinding Method:**
Hario Mini Mill Grinder. $30 on Amazon, free shipping.
http://www.amazon.com/Hario-MSS-1B-Mini-Coffee-Grinder/dp/B001804CLY

I've used this grinder. Works great. A perfect budget mortar grinder. ""chop/blade"" grinders are similar in price (usually cheaper) but they screw your beans up, buy this instead! If $30 is too much, you can use a grinder in the grocery store until you can afford your own. Set the grinder to MED-FINE and grind your beans. You'll lose some flavor but when you ain't got the money, you ain't got the money!

**Filters:** $1.70 at my local grocery store for a box of oxygen whitened #2 cone filters. 

**Accessories** You need a 1 cup pyware/microwave safe measuring cup to house your hot water. Can be bought for a few bucks at the store or hopefully you already have one somewhere! You also need a spoon. 

**HOW TO BREW THE COFFEE:**

Step 1. Grind about 1-2 tablespoons of coffee per 1 cup (you can adjust this for your own taste). Make sure the screw on the Hario is tightened to create a medium-fine grind ([what is this?](http://www.ineedcoffee.com/03/coffeegrind/) )

Step 2: Heat water in microwave (or stove if you have a kettle) to boiling. 

Step 3. Put filter into Melitta pour over (pro-tip: fold edges of filter to create a nice fit)

Step 4: Put ground beans into filter.

Step 5: Pour hot water (slightly below boiling temp 195-205F) in filter. Pour about half a cup in. 

Step 6. Wait until it drains a little bit. Take spoon and scrape coffee off the edges of the filter back into the bottom. Pour the remaining hot water into the filter. Wait until all water is gone.

Step 7: Throw filter away, enjoy a jolly good cup of joe.

This is obviously not the only way to brew good coffee, but this is a pretty cheap method to create pretty awesome coffee. Good luck!

The machines are all beautiful, and I would love to collect the high end stuff from both cultures, even if I never used them.

The reason I ask is because any comment made against intelligentsia becomes downvoted to hell. Even if its a constructive criticism made of their coffee, lack of blends, so on, it becomes downvoted.

Has /r/coffee forgotten that the downvote key is **not** a dislike key? It is there for pushing comments that dont contribute to the conversation out of the way.

From the Reddiquette page:
&gt;Moderate based on quality, not opinion. Well-written and interesting content can be worthwhile, even if you disagree with it.

&gt;Dont downvote opinions just because you disagree with them. The down arrow is for comments that add little or nothing to the discussion

I just came back from a coffee shop in LA that made their black coffee with the vacuum method, and I thought that was awesome.  I am a coffee lover and I like learning new things, but I'm not a coffee expert.  Anyway the barista, was making my cappuccino and he made art with the foam, which I have been trying to replicate at home, so I asked him ""aw thats so pretty, I've been trying to do that at home! Do you have any tips?"" and he answered with a snobby tone ""umm .... do it more.."" He kind of said it with a smirk too.  When I ordered a black coffee for my mom, he also said...""here smell the coffee before I make it"" (after he ground it) then proceeded to stare at his friends and just smile... while I stood there...
I might be overreacting but it really bugs me when people think they're better than others; especially when someone asks a genuine question.
Yea I might not know a lot about coffee at all actually, and i'm trying to learn but really its not fun for anyone when you're being a snobby dick.
It just made me embarrassed and I felt super turned off by the place even though it was a super awesome little cafe. :( 

P.S. I have nothing against hipsters, just the hipster dicks.

EDIT: anyone feel the same way? or has this happened to any of you?

**EDIT**: This was at 9:30 PM and my mom and I were the only customers in the shop (excluding the barista's two friends) and he didn't seem to be stressed because he was talking and joking around with his buddies. 
**EDIT**:The place was called Balconi Coffee Company, don't get me wrong, the coffee was amazing and it's a lovely place but the person who served me wasn't quite nice.

I just finished my morning mild-sugar Turkish coffee and decided to say hi.   

I want to explain all you how we prepare our Turkish coffee first.  The beans are Arabica brand. We buy our coffee from our dried-fruit shops.  We have purpose-machines to grind them as tiny as they can get ([here](http://imgur.com/aoxbQu6)). We mix the coffee with sugar depending on the users preferences, and start boiling it with a low temperature. We have again purpose boilers, and we just stop boiling after there is enough foam.  What counts most is to create enough foam, and to distribute the delicious coffee foam to the small porcelain cups ([here](http://imgur.com/4qfiPlV) it is for the unwary). We often make fun if the coffee is without foam, the serving person will not be able to marry.

And sure, we have starbucks and every other global brand. Hipsters mostly don't drink Turkish coffee. But I think it's delicious.

I want to clear up what seems to be a common misconception. Pour overs are easy. That's right. Simple. I know, google pour over technique and you're inundated with details. Water exactly this hot, pour this fast, pour a spiral outward (or inward),  pour straight in the middle, pour continuously, pour in spurts, grind this fine or that coarse, and so on. Yeah, this all can (sometimes, maybe, depending on your palate) change the cup you end up with. But forget all that. You know what a pour over is? Hot water on top of ground coffee. A mr. coffee can do that, and it doesn't even have a brain.

Here's the thing. You aren't brewing this cup for a panel of snobbish judges. You're brewing it for you. So forget all the silly techniques people will tell you must adhere to. There's a reason there's so much variation. Brew a cup you like to drink.

That being said, there are a few things that noticeably (to even a first time drinker) and objectively change the cup. The first is the ratio of coffee to water. The standard is 2 tablespoons ground coffee to 8 ounces water. Not strong enough? Add more coffee. Too strong? Use more water.

The second (and perhaps more complex) variable is the grind. We could go into the differences between roast depths and oil levels and region specific characteristics, but you don't need to know about that yet. Standard grind is medium. Smack dab in the middle. Just slightly coarser than table salt. Coarser gets you a more watery cup, finer gets a stronger cup.

Now. Water temperature is easy. Bring to a boil, wait 20-30 seconds, pour. There is less wiggle room here because of the chemistry of coffee, but it's fine if you aren't perfect. Remember, hot water on top of coffee grounds. Easy.

Now we pour. Here's where people get insane. It's ok though. Only two things *really* matter. First, we let it bloom. Add just enough water to soak most of the coffee. Now wait. You should see the grounds bubble and rise. This is carbon dioxide escaping, giving you a truer taste in your cup. Wait 15 or so seconds and finish pouring. The only thing that matters now is avoiding the edge of the grounds. Get too close, and the water will get sucked down the filter without touching the coffee.

This is a bit longer than I meant it to be, but it's fairly simple right? Don't freak about your technique. As long as your coffee is drinkable, you did it right.",,False,,t5_2qhze,False,,,True,t3_16pec1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/16pec1/on_pour_overs/,

1309846806.0,97,self.Coffee,igyuv,I made a (fairly) comprehensive guide to brewing good coffee which should answer a lot of common questions ,smellgibson,114,17,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/igyuv/i_made_a_fairly_comprehensive_guide_to_brewing/,"**NOTE:** If you have a correction, please make it known. This is not complete. This is a composite of a lot of my notes on coffee related material. I thought that I might as well share it.

A guide for those interested in learning about coffee stuff:

**Brewing methods:**

**Turkish (with an Ibrik)**

* Supposedly the oldest type of apparatus that was used to brew coffee. It uses EXTREMELY finely ground coffee and is very strong coffee. It is brewed with sugar and coffee in an Ibrik on a stove. This would be good if you like strong coffee. More info on brewing Turkish coffee here: http://coffeegeek.com/guides/turkishcoffee

**Vacuum/Siphon Pots**

* Another old form of making coffee. It was invented before the press pot. Basically how it works is that boiling water gets pushed into a pot above it through vapor pressure, combines with coffee grinds, then gets sucked back down to the original pot. They are great for more body and less sediment than press pot.
* Good models are Yama and Cona, along with hario.

**Press Pot (French Press)**

* A simple way of making coffee by way of filtration. Has a lot of sediment but is great for exposing flavor notes of a bean. It is easy, cheap, and effective. It is great for a beginner.
* Good models are made by bodum and Frieling.

**Pour-over**

* Another easy way of making coffee. Most people use it because it is clean, easy, and great at showing what is great in a coffee. If you want to get serious about it then you will get a gooseneck kettle.
* Most people use Hario for this.

**Aeropress**

* A fairly new way of making coffee. It makes strong coffee and is great for travel because of its durable plastic material. It tries to make an “espresso-like” coffee. It is incredibly easy to use and clean.

**Auto-Drip**

* An automatic drip coffee maker (sometimes called a dripolator) attempts to automate the pour over process. Choose an auto drip that get the water up to greater than 190F (88C) and that has a good sprinkle head that will saturate the grounds in the filter holder.
* Pros: Automates the pour over process thus freeing up time to perform some other action during the brewing process. Produces good quality coffee if the water temperature is high enough.
* Cons: Not many dripolators sold in consumer department stores can heat the water up to the 190F/88C temperature and those that do are very expensive (over $200USD -- see Technivorm). The pots that have a heat plate can burn the coffee if left on for long periods of time. Some steel thermal carafes can adversely affect the taste of the coffee. Also the heating elements require descaling with chemicals in order to operate properly and to continue to heat the water up to proper temperature.
* Thanks, snutr for writing this part

**Moka Pot**

* An espresso maker that is made by way of steam. It is the easiest and cheapest way to make espresso. I would recommend this for someone who wants to have espresso at home, but doesn't want to break the bank.


**Espresso:**
Espresso is a monster of the coffee world and is very much so for only those who are very dedicated to good coffee and are willing to invest a lot of money into this passion. Beginners should not start out with an espresso machine. It is just too advanced. I’m sure some people have started this way but I still wouldn’t recommend it.

**Types of Espresso machines:**

**Lever machines**

* These are for the true espresso enthusiast. You are a part of every single step of brewing the espresso. These are not easy to use and are extremely particular when it comes to grind size, and pressure applied.
* I use a La Pavoni, it seems to be the most popular lever machine.

**Semi-Auto**

* Most used type of machine for the home when it comes to the coffee enthusiast. If you want one, keep this in mind: machines built with plastic tubing maintain heat the worst, brass is better and copper tubing is best. This applies to all espresso makers.
* People tend to like the Silvia for this. It uses brass tubing and has tons of reference on it on the web.
* Note: if you want a decent machine, make sure it is pump driven.

**Super-Auto:**

* It does everything for you. Usually the components of such a machine are sub par compared to the semi-auto machines such as a bad grinder attached to a bad espresso machine.

**Grinders:**

* Grinders are arguably the MOST important part of making good coffee. Trust me, it makes an incredible amount of difference if you have a nice grinder. Do NOT skimp on the grinder. What makes a good grinder is the ability to get a very fine grind, adjust-ability of the grind particle size, and uniformity of the grind particle size.
* **Blade** grinders are not recommended for any type of coffee brewing. This is because there is no way to make a uniform grind. Also, the motors for the glades heat up the grinds which hurts the aromas.
* **Burr** is what you want because they make grind particles in uniform sizes. Cheapest thing you can get is a hand crank mill.
* Baratza has fantastic grinders, and so far are my favorite for the home barista.

**Roasting:**

* Roasting: what makes it so we are able to make a drink out of coffee. It seems to be getting more and more popular lately to roast at home. A lot of beginners of the home roasting world tend to use a hot air popcorn popper in order to roast beans. This is good because it is cheap and effective. The downsides are that you have no temperature control over the roast, no airflow control, and can only make very small batches at a time. It is the perfect way for a beginner to start roasting.

* **Hot Air roasters** use convection to roast the beans. These create a brighter and highly toned cup because the roast smoke is continuously blown out of the chamber.
* **Drum Roasters:** beans are agitated by tumbling in a turning roast chamber. Roasts are more balanced between full body and brightness. You can usually have much larger batches with drum roasters.
* [Here](http://www.sweetmarias.com/roasting-VisualGuideV2.php) is a guide to how the roasting process works.


**The Coffee Bean**

* 2 types of coffee trees that are generally used for drinking: *Coffea arabica* and *Coffea robusta*. *Coffea arabica* is what is used the most and generally tastes the best.
* Catimor is the mix of both and was developed through science.

**Processing Methods**

* wet processed
* dry processed
* pulped natural

**Wet processed** is when the coffee cherry is stripped off gently by water. These seem to be brighter and cleaner. **Dry Processed** is when they are dried (usually in the sun) then the cherry is taken off. These are generally fruitier and heavier in body and produce more crema in espresso. **Pulped natural** is when some of the cherry is taken off, the pulp dries on the bean, then is taken off.  It takes characteristics of both other methods and combines them. Sometimes these can taste more fermented, or wine-y.

**Coffees of the world**

For this part I will just describe what coffees from each country **generally** taste like. This is from both experience and reference.

**Africa (where coffee originally came from)**

* **Yemen:** medium to full bodied, fruit and wine notes.
* **Ethiopia:** specifically Yirgacheffe, extremely floral, mid to light bodied
* **Kenya:** very fruity, medium bodied
* **Tanzania:** wine-like acidity, low acidity, medium body
* **Uganda:** fruity, medium body
* **Zimbabwe:** high acidity, fruity, wine-y

**Central America**

* **Mexico:** mild body, light acidity.
* **Guatemala:** complex, acidic, floral, fruit, mid to full body
* **Honduras:** full bodied, sweet
* **El Salvador:** medium body, lightly acidic. One of my favorites for blending
* **Nicaragua:** full bodied, low acidity
* **Costa Rica:** full bodied, bright, very balanced. 
* **Panama:** medium bodied, mildly floral, sweet.

**South America**

* **Colombia:** mid to full bodied, balanced, high acidity.
* **Venezuela:** mild, sweet.
* **Ecuador:** mild, slightly floral.
* **Bolivia:** balanced, sweet.
* **Peru:** medium body, slight acidity and sweetness.
* **Brazil:** depends on the coffee really. Lots of variance from region to region.

**Caribbean and Central American Islands**

* **Jamaica:** Home of the famous blue island coffee, medium bodied, mild flavor, rich acidity
* **Haiti:** sweet, medium bodied, slight fermented notes.
* **Dominican Republic:** (a good alternative for blue mountain) balanced, soft, rich acidity
* **Puerto Rico:** full bodied, balanced, rich acidity

**Asia and various islands**

* **Sumatra:** very full bodied, slight fruit tones
* **Sulawesi:** very full bodied, earthy
* **Java:** medium bodied, lightly acidic, floral, fruity
* **Papua New Guinea:** citrus, floral, balanced, heavy body
* **India:** sweet, medium bodied, floral
* **Hawaii:** mid acidity, mid bodied, balanced

In middle school, I would go to a math program on Thursday afternoons at the local college, and then afterwards would have to wait until 5 PM for my parents to pick me up. So, every week I would go to the coffee shop and order a Latte or Cappuccino and do homework (play Runescape).

Then in high school, my dad got a Keurig machine, so I'd start most mornings with a cup of coffee. Back then, it was the best coffee ever. After high school, I had a brief 1 year stint with Starbucks, and then got my dad's old french press. I found a coffee roaster not too far that actually let you order a roast and watch it being roasted, and from there I kinda went crazy and subscribed to /r/coffee, and my first (real) espresso machine is in the mail.

Thinking back about it now, it was terrible coffee. But over the last six months I have begun roasting my own coffee and discovering how little I knew about coffee. 

But on to my story, the day before yesterday I roasted a pound of Ethiopia Illubador in a whirley-pop. I aimed for a dark roast and was a little nervous when I took it out and saw it was a bit darker than I was trying for; up until now I have been roasting in an air popper. Anyways, I let it sit, and then this morning I grind some up and put it in the moka pot. When I was grinding I thought I could smell a hint of chocolate and I thought, ""No, it must be from something else."" But after I brewed it and sat down to have a sip it tasted delightful and there it was again, that hint of chocolate. It was a slight hint of dark chocolate. 

I quickly go look at the label for the beans and there it was: Moderate brightness, peach notes, floral hints, **chocolate roast** and dense body. This is the first time that something like this has really stood out to me. I feel as though a whole new world of coffee has opened up to me.

So here's my little howto so that other can enjoy this smooth tasting drink.

It's really simple if you follow the steps. You don't need a thermometer and it won't be bitter or sour. It should go without saying that you should use quality beans.

* Boil water in a oversizes pot.
* Take water off heat and uncover. Leave for 2-4 minutes.
* While the water is cooling, grind your coffee into fine ground. 
* Gently stir the grains into the pot of hot water.
* Let sit for at least 6 minutes, or enough that the coffee grounds have sunk to the bottom.
* Pour coffee out of the pot directly into a mug, leaving the bottom grounds.

The over sized pot is a good idea because it makes poring the coffee more accurate. The idea of grinding while the water cools is twofold: you takes 2-4 minutes so the water cools enough to not burn the coffee, and you get freshly grounded coffee. A fine ground is needed for optimal taste and so that they all sink to the bottom of the pot. I've found that letting the coffee sit for at least 6 minutes is needed to allow the grounds enough time to sink to the bottom, I usually wait 10 minutes if I have the time (although I don't mind a few grounds in my coffee).

A note about the taste, I've found that this type of coffee doesn't really get over steeped for my taste, I even like it cold after it's been sitting in the pot for a while, and I usually hate cold coffee! In my experience, bitterness in coffee comes from forcing the coffee through the coffee grounds like with a french press or to a lesser deggree with drip coffee, which is exactly what cowboy coffee avoids.

Portable version: Poor the boiling water into a travel mug to cool and add grounds directly to the mug. Cover and go! The grounds will sink to the bottom of the mug leaving delicious coffee for you to drink off the top.

And black is the only way to drink it! :-D",,False,,t5_2qhze,1365038998.0,,,True,t3_1bldxi,http://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1bldxi/cowboy_coffee_howto/,

1338069808.0,89,self.Coffee,u6hq9,"[MOD] The State of /r/Coffee: our own little Third Place, online.  ",Anomander,102,13,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/u6hq9/mod_the_state_of_rcoffee_our_own_little_third/,"So this is an ... announcement? that has been coming a long time.  I've been pretty clear in my participation in threads under my [M] flag that we take not just coffee seriously, but the /r/coffee experience as well.  

However, I understand our readership may not all have seen those posts, and I wish to make this post to both finalize and make clear exactly what your mod team means with the two most recent additions to our rules, and our reasoning behind them.  

&gt;.6. Respect others participating in the sub/maintain civil discourse.

&gt;.7. Please no posts scorning others' tastes.

So first off: no, sadly, we're not kidding. We appreciate these are scary, mean-sounding rules that set the stage for thought control and censorship and all things mean and nasty that reddit hates.  We're sorry if that's your impression, and that's not our intent or aim.  

**Rule 6:**  We aim to have the community treat /r/coffee like an online cafe.  It's a fun, safe, and calm place for people to enjoy coffee and talk about our shared passion.  Sure, you can't order a drink, but you can make your perfect drink in the comfort of wherever you are, and sit down with some stragers to chat about the real black gold.  We want an environment where civilised, if highly caffeinated, discussion is the norm, and we've written the above rules to give us the same tools that cafe staff have in managing the conduct of patrons.  

Readers are asked to understand that conduct inappropriate in a face-to-face context is equally inappropriate here, and users who are needlessly rude, aggressive, argumentitave, or confronatational will be asked to modify their conduct.  We are and will continue to be very generous with warnings, and we see bans - even temporary ones - as a method of last resort.  However, just as a patron picking fights with others in a cafe will be asked to leave, we will ban users who do not take warnings to heart or otherwise are unable to play nicely with their peers.  For the most part, these bans will be temporary (Reddit does not have a temp ban tool, so we will try and remember to lift them after the agreed-upon period, but also will ask the user themselves to remind us.), but we are willing to make them permanent if need be.  

In no way is this intended to force you all to get along.  We understand that coffee is a taste-driven topic, and there are myriad fandoms and snobberies, and disagreements are inevitable.  We just ask that you remember there is a real live person who will be recieving your reply, and that you respect them as a person, even if you don't respect their taste.  We are not final arbiters of disagreements, and if both parties are complicit, we will speak to both of you.  

Lastly, we appreciate that not everyone is offended or hurt by the same things.  How the recipient takes it is largely irrelevant to us - we won't pander to lowest-common-demoninator offenses, handing out warnings because someone didn't cage their rebuttal in flowery retractions and HR-speak to soften the blow.  However, we also don't take into account if the recipient was unoffended - it's not just the specific conduct, but the example it sets that is important to us.  

**Rule 6 TLDR:** It is important to the kind of community we're trying to create that you all treat each other like real people, and don't set out to pick fights, call names, or behave in an otherwise uncivilized manner, and we're willing to use the ban tool if a warning isn't sufficient to get the message across.  

**Rule 7:**  We are a community for *all* coffee lovers.  If someone likes their coffee differently than you do, even if its in a way you consider to ""ruin"" good coffee, that's entirely on them, and none of your or this communty's business.  

We don't want a Starbucks Frappe lover to roll up here interested in expanding their horizons, and be met by a post cutting them and their favourite beverage down for not having more pretentious tastes.  Most modern coffee lovers, especially young ones, got their start drinking sugary coffee smoothies and flavoured lattes, and worked up from there.  

Posts that do nothing more than denigrate anothers' tastes are unwelcoming, unwelcome, and will be removed.  If you want to vent that someone wants three kinds of syrup in your favorite single-origin craft roasted peaberry pour over, please find somewhere else to do that.  It is, in my opinion, sheer heresy, but it's also incredibly rude to tell them that to their face, and assuming that someone with those tastes will not read the post is no longer reasonable given the size of our community.  

I would far rather we welcome and take in the coffee smoothie and flavoured latte crowd and convert them to our more highbrow tastes than drive them off with pretension, snobbery, and scorn.  

To clarify in advance: posts interested in ""how do I start converting [person] from instant coffee/sugary lattes/double-doubles over to more interesting, nicer coffee?"" because those serve constructive purpose beyond ""they like something I don't like, let's all scorn their philistine tastes!"" 

In light of rule 6, these sorts of posts will not be warn-able or ban-able unless a single user is a *very* recurring problem or post content is otherwise problematic. We'll just click the ""remove"" button and move on.   

**Rule 7 TLDR:** Someone liking something you don't like is not cause to hoist them up for public ridicule in /r/coffee.  Posts doing so will be removed.  

Lastly, dear friends: we're committed to the ideal, but flexible on the rules.  We're open to suggestions of better ways of achieving the same goals if you feel you have a better idea.

As I go in, I see a big fancy bag of Three Region Blend opened, next to their grinder, opposite of a little pour over station. 

I ask if I can try the Three Region Blend as a pour-over. The woman at the counter turns and looks at the plastic case of pre-ground coffee and apologizes, saying there is none ground up right now. Taken aback, I ask what she does have ""ground up right now?"" She lists Pike, Veranda, and dark roast. Okay... I'll take some Veranda. She turns around, looks at the big silver pitchers and says ""we do have Pike and dark roast brewed up already, are you sure you don't just want one of those?"" 

""No, it's okay, I was hoping to try the Veranda."" Note I even tried to give my sorry-about-that face.

""But it would be a lot easier... because... um, well, we have these already brewed...""

I told her to forget it and walked out. On my way out I hear her go ""what an ass."" 

I should never feel like I should have to change my order to make some bitch at a coffee shop's job easier. I'm a very easy going guy, but my next plan of action is to stop back in next time I'm at the grocery store and ask to talk to their manager and ask for a job application hoping he will ask why I would like to work for them, and tell him it's because I want to replace the woman working at the counter who tries to convince people to order different things because they will be easier for her.

What is the worst cup you've ever had? Describe the circumstances, and the cup (what made it so bad?).

I'll start - I was waiting for my car to get fixed at a Honda dealership, sitting there in their waiting room that smelled of tires, alone. Thankfully, I had my copy of *The Economist* which I love to read, especially when there's nothing else to do. But I noticed there was a coffee machine in the corner one of those industrial sized ""Bunn"" ones (I think that's the brand) that looks like it's from 1992. 

Now, there is nothing I love more in the world than drinking coffee with my Economist, so despite my judgement that the coffee would probably not be very good, I was tempted in anyway. I wanted the coffee. What can I say, I'm addicted. You're looking at a guy who has eaten instant. 

Alas.

It was lukewarm, burnt, rancid, watery bullshit. I couldn't even finish it. I may be a bit snobbish with coffee but I like to consider myself pretty versatile and open to coffees of... various quality. I've been known to drink all kind of shitty coffee. Burnt pre-ground Folgers on a drip? Yeah sure okay, I'll have it, I *do* love coffee, you know.

But this was just too much. I was in shock. I thought I knew what bad coffee tasted like, but I was wrong. I would compare the taste to drinking bleach or crude oil. Just awful.

Anyway, what are you stories? Most importantly, what drove you to drink the coffee in the first place (maybe I'll make another thread about most desperate lengths ever gone to for a fix)?",,False,,t5_2qhze,False,,,True,t3_vt12n,http://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/vt12n/worst_coffee_youve_ever_had/,

I didn't really even like coffee when I started, I just got the job because some friends recommended it. After some time, I grew to like, even love coffee. Five years later, I now drink my coffee black like a big boy. 

In the past couple of years, I've had some letdowns and bad experiences with my job that made me care less about it. Where I once was very keen on identifying the different flavor notes in coffee, I've recently grown dull to them, making the job I once loved just a job again. Since finding this subreddit, some friends and I have been experimenting with different brewing methods. It's turned my search for the coffee I'm least tired of to the joy of tasting a well-crafted cup of coffee, reminding me of what I love about coffee. 

I once had an ambition to own my own coffee shop. Cynicism wore me down. Now, it would seem, I love coffee again. My passion has been reignited. I've begun experimenting again, as well as searching for little gems like the 25 cent French press I found in a thrift store today that works perfectly. I'm in love again, so thank you /r/Coffee. I plan to stick around here for a little while.

1366031389.0,79,self.Coffee,1cdxob,New Barista spreading love (have a look!),TimmehCh3w,107,28,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1cdxob/new_barista_spreading_love_have_a_look/,"Hi reddit, I'm sort of new to the whole reddit thing but my friends introduced reddit to me a little while back, and so far I've enjoyed reading many TILs and AMAs along with some other pretty nifty things. There are many things I'm still new too, like subreddits (I think these are like forums topics I guess?) or Gold (I have no idea what this is either but I assume its some sort of currency.)  


Anyway I am a Barista, and I love my job. I love drinking coffee and making coffee, something I could never have seen myself doing if my life hadn't taken a downward spiral. I'm 23, and because of certain things my dad has done divorce, leaving the family etc, I've been forced to quit uni to start working to support my family. Currently with all the bills including the rent to support my family, my net savings per month is in the negative (yes I am eating into whatever small savings I have left).  

Why am I telling you all this? Because at one point in my life, I had a very bleak outlook on things. I thought about many different ways I could die, I wished I would suddenly develop a brain tumor that would kill me and what not. I hated things.  
  

But then I started working as a Barista. I got introduced to the gig from a friend who started a student-runned cafe at this college. I was initially just looking for a full-time job to pay the bills, so initially I was just meant to be a server.  
  

But when they talked to me about how a good coffee is pulled, and all the technicalities involved, I got really interested. Eventually I starting making coffee orders even though I wasn't allowed to, but I kept at it anyway, until eventually, I could reach a basic standard.  
  

From there, I tried to push the limits of my art and try harder designs, and the feedback was great. People started taking pictures of the coffee I served and some event started coming back just for the coffee.  
  

I also started talking to people more, strangers, I've never met, exchange students whom I may never see again. And this was something I thought I could never do ( I was a bit of an introvert).  
  

Eventually I quit the student cafe, it was bitter-sweet but there was a lot of nonsense that I had to put up with while working there, and it made me hate my job, so eventually I left and joined a new place.  
  

The new place has a much wider clientele, and its opened my eyes to greater experiences.
I used to be snobby at first, and I would roll my eyes or make snarky comments at the side when people wanted their coffee ""Extra hot"" or wanted their cappuccinos with ""less foam""  
  
  

I've grown to accommodate such silly requests with a smile, and even chat with them, on certain occasions I evened asked about their personal preferences or their weird requests and I have gained a greater understanding from them.  
  

I love the work I do, I love making kids happy with simple cat faces or pandas, I love making people enjoy a tasting cuppa that looks great as well.  
  

I love my job because it makes people happy, and that makes me happy. I go to work everyday with a much more positive outlook, it occupies me from the stuff like my bills and my terrible family situation.  
  
  

I know at the end some of you may be wondering, whats with the wall of text, but I just wanted to share my art and share the real feelings that comes with it, the effort and the heart that I put into my work (whether people appreciate it or not), and I also wanted to share my passion.  
  
  
I've decided that I would eventually plan to start a cafe of my own eventually that caters to a more personalized touch rather than worrying about costs and commercialization, and I hope I'll be able to achieve this in a couple of years time  
  
  
Anyway I've never been a big fan of blogging and what not, but since I've started, I've actually quite liked sharing the work I do, and I would like to share my genuine feelings with others, and to let people out there know that there are some people who do enjoy their work, and who do work to bring happiness to others.  
  
  
I hope you guys like it too, and I hope you guys will spread the love

I like my job, and I would like to share my work with others and you can check it out here:

I work for Ruta Maya - some of you might have heard of it, since Ruta Maya is first and foremost a roaster, and their beans are widely distributed and fairly popular. There are two Ruta Maya cafe locations; I work at the one in the airport.

I've been consistently aggravated with Ruta Maya for sending us horribly burnt beans. The ones they send us for retail always look great, but the ones they send us in bulk to serve to our customers are consistently oily, black, and unevenly roasted, and make accordingly bitter coffee. Nobody else in the store really cares (I'm the only one there who actually identifies as a coffee afficionado), but every once in a while I get customers who have a developed enough palate to call us out on having a terrible, terrible medium roast. Its embarassing, and I hate being blamed for the poor quality of our coffee.

I have been a coffee drinker for years. Just the standard stuff, starbucks beans, ground in a blade grinder, made in a drip coffee maker. I knew that stuff was better than Folgers or gas station coffee, but I never knew what was really out there. So, I did my research and bought a few new coffee implements, a moka pot and a hario hand burr grinder to start, but I was still missing an important ingredient... fantastic beans. So, last week, I ordered some Intelligentsia El Diablo. Hot damn. Its like I'm not even drinking what I knew and thought of as coffee. Its sweet and thick and deep and infinitely satisfying and delicious. I am looking forward to trying beans from other roasters and I look forward to brewing my morning cuppa when I go to bed at night. So, I just wanted to say that and thanks to /r/coffee for all of the great tips and advice!

p.s. -- I also bought an aeropress and it works very well!",,False,,t5_2qhze,False,,,True,t3_pzamm,http://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/pzamm/finally_drinking_coffee_the_way_its_meant_to_be/,

Stayed in Oakland with a relative. Having been in LA/SD for the majority of my life, I was always a ""socal&gt;norcal"" kind of guy. But after seeing how great of a city SF was and the abundance of coffee roasters, my opinion has changed. Anyway, moving on with coffee.

* Disclaimer, still a noob. I can only discern good coffee from bad. Always learning.


**Day 1 of 2**
First stop - Blue Bottle in the Mint District. I had a siphon, forgot which bean I tried. The barista was very friendly. He helped explain the workings of a siphon to my relative. Place was nice. Baristas were friendly as well and the place didn't look too intimidating. Some places like Handsome are quite intimidating for a first timer trying better coffee.

**Day 2 of 2**
Second stop - Four Barrel. Hands down the most interesting decor out of all the coffee shops I've visited. Very cool and unique feel. The boar heads, which I didn't get a picture of, were neat. I had the ""Los Cauchos"" from Colombia. Liked it enough to buy a bag of beans from them.

Third stop - Ritual. Ritual's coffee shop didn't stand out as much as the others. I got a pour over, forgot which bean. Got a bag of beans and their cup that they sell. They were also having a cupping session while I was there.

Fourth Stop - Sight Glass. I got there 20 minutes before they closed. So my experienced was rushed. The coffee shop was unique. Huge and open. In the center is the bar. They had an upstairs. Felt like a warehouse. I liked it. At this point I've already had too much caffeine in my system. I didn't really get to spend as much time here as I'd like.

**Day 3**
Had to leave early so I stopped by the Blue Bottle in Oakland. Grabbed an iced coffee and a double chocolate chip cookie as per someone's recommendation from my earlier thread on r/coffee. Neat location.

Stopped in Santa Cruz to try out Verve. Very chill spot. Completely different feel from SF. Chatted with the baristas. They told me that Verve has secured a spot in the Art's District of LA. Some competition for Handsome.

So I had some gunpowder tea laying around and decided to give it a go. The result was amazing! It was a very nice cup of tea, nice strong flavour and aroma, as well as a good mouth feel.

I realise this may not be the best subreddit for this, but I figured those of you that enjoy tea sometimes as well would like to know this, if you didn't already.

There is, however, something that I’ve been thinking about. Where goes the line between one who just likes to drink (and possibly prepare) coffee (or beer/wine/whatever else) and one who is perceived as pretentious or as a snob?

I’ve thought up a few points where I’d draw the line:

•	People who give unsolicited advice to people who ‘make poor coffee’ (for lack of better phrasing) or those who just don’t care tend to be disliked. Nobody likes to be told that they suck.

•	People who complain about what they are given freely. I remember seeing a post here some time ago where the poster was at a party, and instead of drinking whatever the plebeians were drinking he cobbled together a pour-over from a strainer and some filters. That guy crossed the line, and by a wide margin. One thing is complaining about your barista screwing up your cappuccino by forgetting to add milk, but when your grandma makes you coffee you’d better drink it with a smile.

I’d like to hear what you guys think, because I bet at least some of you have been called either a snob or prententious by someone.
 
I’ve taken myself in giving advice to people who didn’t ask for it, and in retrospect I feel like an ass. Therefore I try to minimize my snobbery to those who ask for input.

I come to you from the distant land of [/r/cigars](/r/cigars) and come with a story of an amazing trade I just had. As a little preface, our subreddit regularly trades cigars. But the only way to verify someone is to trade with a verified member (think of verification like an STD. Yep). Here's the trade I had with a member of the US Air Force in Alaska. I thought you all would enjoy his badassery as well.

A few days ago, emosgood joined in a conversation of me spouting off about coffee and offered to send me some if I sent him sticks. I thought ""Sure, why not? It'll get me some new coffee and maybe verify a new member."" So, in my usual fashion, I packaged up more sticks than we agreed to and sent them on their way to Anchorage, AK. Then today, I saw a large flat rate box heading towards my house. A large one?! What extra did he send?! Well, the original agreement was 4 sticks for a pound of coffee. Emosgood looked at that agreement and said ""Fuck that, I'll send this asshole everything needed to open up a home coffee shop!""

[THIS](http://www.imgur.com/lGeQX.jpg) is what his end of the trade was. He sent me two pounds of Kaladi Brothers' Coffee (both of which were roasted probably a few hours before he sent it): a 5.5 grind of Papua New Guinea as an everday drinker and a coarse grind of Sumatra for the BRAND NEW FRENCH PRESS he sent me. All I had was a cheap one from Kmart, so he decided to get me an upgrade. It's smaller than the one I have now, but it doesn't feel cheap like my old one. As if that wasn't enough, he sent along some organic chocolate from a local chocolate lounge (which I am eating right now, and it is delicious). And the piece de resistance: His squadron patch. I used to be in JROTC in high school, so I love all these little military trinkets. If the other airmen at Elmendorf AFB are as awesome as emosgood, I'd I've found my new favorite squadron.",,False,,t5_2qhze,False,,,True,t3_p9pqp,http://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/p9pqp/traded_cigars_for_coffee_with_an_airman_in_alaska/,

  Aside from the fact that a single extraction is very small volumetrically and takes no time to drink, this inevitably results in any of the following:

1) You shoot it down en route to your vehicle, and now an empty paper espresso cup will be rolling around in your car for days/weeks

2) You pretend that it is OK to sip your espresso over the course of the next several hours.  It isn't.  The greatest extraction ever would still taste like shit after just a few minutes, if not sooner

3) You're going to top off the ""to go"" cup (usually 8oz) with the free milk on the condiment bar, thus making yourself a ghetto cold latte.  Cheapskate.


Anyway, it is wasteful, you inevitably lose crema in the transfer from shotglass to cup, you arouse the ire of your barista, and SERIOUSLY, just drink it right away and you get to enjoy the flavor how it's supposed to be.

**EDIT-** Formatting

**LONG EDIT-** So there are a lot of apparently hurt feelings.  Words like ""elitist"" and ""snob"" are being thrown around, because apparently, I am ""telling people they can't drink their drink their coffee in the WRONG fashion"".  Here are some details that reveal this to be rubbish:

Tell me where in here it says that I refuse to give people espresso to go?  Tell me where in here that it says I laugh at people after they leave, ""LOL, that person took their espresso to go, WHAT AN IDIOT!""  In one comment below, I actually explain exactly how I approach situations wherein folks ask for espresso to go.  Since you probably won't go look for it, as that would require you to abandon your apparent hipster coffee douche assumptions (made well in advance of reading any of this), I'll simply quote it here:

*""If someone asks for espresso, I very conspicuously put the small ""for here"" cup up on the machine. If they say they want it to go, I ask them if they're sure, and explain that it just takes a sec to drink and is better fresh. If they still want it to go, I tell them no problem and put it in an 8oz paper cup. Never impolite.""*

I also want to address a VERY common issue that is super prevalent in the coffee industry.  People seem to think that there is nothing objective in the world of coffee quality, and that all must be subjective.  Such a viewpoint is displayed flagrantly in the following comment, also quoted from below, posted by user chrisbooth12:

*""...no he is being an elitist who just because he works in the field thinks his opinions matter more.""*

There are several issues with this comment.  For starters, I DO work in the field,and have done so in one capacity or another for over 5 years cumulatively, and experience has a tendency to teach a person a thing or two.  In short, I have experience, and offer advice based upon that experience.  In this case, working in the field entitles (or at least better enables) me to give some advice on how to take your espresso.  Recall also that it is just that, ADVICE.  I am not making any edicts.
Back to objective vs subjective - It is NOT subjective that your espresso will taste better (or at least DIFFERENT, in a way almost universally seen as better) fresh.  It is simple chemistry, flavors degrade and oxidation takes place after the espresso is roasted, ground, and pulled, with the changes coming more rapidly each step along the way.

Never have I seen a crowd with more pent up frustration waiting to dollop it out with so little reason to do so.  Go back and read the original post again and ask yourself if your comments are actually warranted.",,False,,t5_2qhze,True,,,True,t3_r6z6z,http://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/r6z6z/barista_thought_of_the_day/,

1351097303.0,68,self.Coffee,120hx2,A quick guide to finding good coffee,Pumpkinsweater,87,19,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/120hx2/a_quick_guide_to_finding_good_coffee/,"After posting [A beginner’s guide to good coffee](http://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/11yaph/a_beginners_guide_to_good_coffee/) there were a lot of ""Ok, that's what good coffee is, but how do I find it?"" questions. Hopefully this is a (relatively) quick guide. And whatever city you're in probably has a good cafe somewhere nearby, and I'm sure people have lots of good recomendations.

There’s a lot of bad coffee out there, if you want to try some of the good stuff, it might require a little work, depending on where you are. There are pretty much two options, one, find a good café, or two, buy some good whole bean coffee and make it at home.

How to find a good café. This is easier in one way, you don’t have to make it yourself, but it can be tough to find a good café amongst the sea of mediocre to bad cafes that fill most cities and towns. To get an idea of the situation, there are at least 30-40 places (cafés, bakeries, coffee houses) within a couple minutes walk from where I work, that I could go to for a coffee break. I’d only recommend two of them for a cup of coffee, and two of them for some espresso (three places in total). Two years ago, there would only have been one place. The best way to tell if a place is any good is to try their coffee a couple times, or get a recommendation from someone who enjoys good coffee. Reviews online can help too, but often times people are actually reviewing the sandwiches, pastries, ambiance, or how many different flavored lattes they have. So, you walk in to a place, what kinds of signs should you look for to see if they’re serious about coffee?

* The coffee should be fresh brewed, if it’s sitting in a thermos it might be OK, but you can do better. It shouldn’t come out of a machine at the touch of a button either. Most good cafes are doing pour over these days, but you’ll see french press, and maybe aero press too. The most important thing is that it’s brewed when you order it, not sitting around.
* They should be proud of who’s roasting their coffee. Some places roast their own, but this is rare. Seeing a well known roaster like Stumptown or Counter Culture is a good sign. But even if it’s just the local roaster, they should let you know who’s doing it, and it should be a point of pride that they’re using good coffee.
* If the main thing they’re selling is coffee, this is a very good sign. It means they’re paying attention to it, and that they’re staking their business on convincing people to come back because their coffee is good, not that their sandwiches or bagels are. This isn’t 100%, I’ve been to some good bakeries that also have people there who are really dedicated to their coffee and do a great job.
* As long as they’re not busy, they should be interested in talking about coffee, and if you tell them that you’ve never had pour-over coffee before, or you want to try something new and interesting, they should be able to give you a recommendation, and talk about the coffee a little bit. If they’re really busy, it’s probably not the time to be too chatty, but every good barista I’ve ever met has always been happy to recommend something good.
* They should have different coffees available, and it should be clear what each one is. Seeing something like a “bold blend” and a “mild blend” is a bad sign, if they have flavored coffee there isn’t much hope either. Something like “Ethiopian” or “Costa Rican” is good, something like “Idido Washed” (the region of Ethiopia and how it was processed) or “Ndaroini peaberry” (the region of Kenya and type of bean) are very good signs. Not because they sound exotic or fancy, but because they’re offering a lot of information. Someone has picked out this specific coffee for a reason, it might not be something you love, but it’s something that stands out and is interesting. On a similar note something like “house blend” is probably code for the “cheap and dark roasted to put in big milk drinks”.

That last point is probably the most important. Coffee isn’t generic and it isn’t “one size fits all.” Some people like bright fruity coffees, some people like woody, funky coffees, some people like chocolaty notes or nuts. None of them are “right”, you can get good coffees that taste like all of that. Some people won’t like one kind, but will love another, some people just like variety. But you want to avoid a place that caters to the lowest common denominator.

If you want to make your own coffee at home, a lot of the same points still apply, you want to find a roaster that offers a variety of coffees. If you’ve got a local roaster, definitely try them out. As long as they’re selling fresh roasted coffees (their bags aren’t sitting on the shelf for weeks) and their not burnt to a crisp (if their roasts are “french roast” or “Vienna roast” or all the beans look black and oily) it’s worth trying. Even if they’re not amazing, a good reliable local roaster is something that most people don’t have. Otherwise you’re going to be looking online, or hoping that a local café carries some fresh coffee. These are much more common, and you just want to avoid the bad stuff:

* Coffee has to have a “roasted on” date. Otherwise you have no idea how old it is, or if it’s any good. Every good roaster I’ve ever tried has a clear “roasted on” date on their bags (and not a “good by” date).
* Avoid roasters that only advertise very broad and simple descriptions like “bold” or “dark” or “flavorful”. These are probably generic, generally lower quality coffees that are trying not to offend anyone too much. And anyone selling flavored coffee should get crossed off your list.
* Information, information, information. There’s a very good correlation between how much a roaster wants to tell you about their coffees and how good they are. Often times the roaster has been down to visit and sample the farm where the coffee is grown, and these day might have been ordering specific lots from the same family year after year. You want to find someone who knows exactly what coffee they’re getting, and what sets it apart.
* The same goes for blends. There are bad blends out there made from cheap coffees, and there are great blends out there made from good coffees. It can be tough to tell them apart. But generally, if the roaster tells you what goes in the blend, that’s a good sign. Some of the bigger roasters probably have to change their blends fairly often as new coffees become available, and old ones run out, but they’ll usually be able to answer a quick email.
* Again, recommendations are good, even the big online roasters I’ve ordered from have been quick to write back with a few notes about different coffees and to recommend a couple I might like.


*Edit* A couple of my standard recomendations for good roasters to try online: Counter Culture, Stumptown, Terroir, Klatch, Blue Bottle. Check out their sites, and you can see the amount of information they have about their coffees, the choices they have for coffees from different regions. They also all have different coffees available at different times during the year as different harvests become available and then get sold, or when some particular farm has a particularly good year, etc.

I brew a variety of ways now.  (Chemex, V60, French press.)  Just wondering if I could add this to the arsenal or if it's not worth even trying.

Edit:  Thanks for all the replies, guys.  I'll give this a shot sometime soon.  I'm prepared for the fact that it won't be as good as the other methods I'm used to since, as has been pointed out below, tea bags aren't even best for tea.  I really just looking for something I can do in a pinch with minimal effort and clean up.  If the trade-off for that is a little loss in quality so be it.  

Edit 2 -- Electric Boogaloo:  I tried this today.   It wasn't bad.  I used 2T of coarsely ground coffee and about 6 oz of water.  Steeped for  4 minutes.   It wasn't as clean or bright of a flavor as my chemex or V60.  It wasn't as full bodied as my french press.

I saw a bunch of Yahoo!Answers posts asking how to maximize the caffeine of a cup of coffee. The problem is they weren't asking the right questions - they were asking if they ran fresh water twice through the same grounds would the coffee be stronger, which obviously it wouldn't. If anything the final product would be weaker because the second time around would be very weak, and mixing it with the original good coffee would weaken it overall. 

My thought was if you made fresh coffee and ran the COFFEE as ""water"" through fresh grounds, would it make the coffee stronger?

Also, does this damage your machine and if so, how?

Our family has a Bosch coffee machine purchased in the 80's from Germany. I guess it's testament to build quality of the time and place that it still works flawlessly after 25+ years, however I have no idea what the method is called or what the machine is called.

Basically the machine has two compartments. One is a standard drip machine which is labelled 'Kaffee' and then there is the mysterious 'espresso' section.

This espresso section contains a reservoir for water and a little plastic holder for coffee. Once you start the machine, it brings the water up to temperature and then when you hold down the button it manages to defy gravity and draw the water up into the coffee holder and then actually spin the coffee and water quite fast (hundreds of RPM I would guess), so I guess it is a centrifuge. From the centrifuge it then pours out the coffee into your glass.

I've asked a forum before about this and no one can identify the machine or concept.

I can post a video/pictures tomorrow morning if that helps. (It's almost 1AM here in Australia).

As for the quality of the coffee, I really don't mind it. If a barista coffee made to my liking is a 10/10, I'd easily give this 8 or higher.

Keen to hear your thoughts!

Well, it took close to 45 minutes to make two servings, but we already learned a lot. 

When I brewed mine, I stirred while it was pre-infusing instead of after adding the final pour. Oops! I ground on 8 clicks (from finest) with the Mini Mill, and I'm not sure if that was good. Dunno. It was much harder to plunge than I though it would be. But all-in-all it produced a great cup! Not sure if it is supposed to produce any crema, but it didn't. I diluted to 50:50 (or what I thought was 50:50; didn't weigh). Tasted just like an Americano. :) 

My wife had a heck of a time. She ground on 10 with the Mini Mill, and decided not to boil another batch of water. She ground for a good fifteen minutes (17g of coffee), went to take it off, and dropped the bottom of the Mini Mill all over the floor. Desperately, she scraped the coffee back up and commenced brewing anyways. Haha! By now, the water was at 175° F. She did the process correctly, but she may have diluted too much. Anyways, even that cup was good!

1357764845.0,63,self.Coffee,169q0f,"Why great espresso needn't mean breaking the bank, and why buying used is the best place to start...",m-a-t-t_,86,23,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/169q0f/why_great_espresso_neednt_mean_breaking_the_bank/,"Just posted this to another thread but thought it was worth an expanded and edited version, given the extent to which it comes up as an issue in posts from newcomers to espresso.

It's a bit of a companion piece to my long ramble on [why espresso machines cost so much](http://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1603wt/why_do_espresso_machines_cost_so_much/).  But hopefully this time focusing on how you can do good espresso cheap.

A lot of people come onto /r/coffee asking what the best espresso machine is they can buy with a budget of anywhere from $100-300.  And the generally correct answer is that, given that in order to get the most out of any machine, you need a good enough quality grinder as well, that sort of budget is simply inadequate.  And whilst some people can get adequate results out of a cheap thermoblock, steam or pressure basketed machine, in general they are disappointing and frustrating for most users, and likely to prove a waste of money rather than a pleasing entry point to making espresso at home.

The hard truth is that, in most circumstances, if you have a budget of less than $400-600, spending your money on an alternative means of making great coffee, such as an aeropress or pourover set up will usually or always give better coffee and more satisfaction than spending it on a cheap and nasty espresso maker from Amazon, Sears or wherever.

The good news is that having a low budget doesn't and shouldn't mean that you cannot assemble the necessary equipment to reliably make a decent to great shot at home. But the route to doing this is not necessarily through waiting for close out sales or compromising and buying that [insert crappy consumer brand] because its better than nothing.  You can do much much better than that.

The route I took was to buy used.  And to aim to buy as good a quality as I could afford with a (very) limited budget.  Over a couple of months some years ago, I put 2-3 months into looking at the internet classifieds and eBay.  After a few weeks of frustration,  I struck lucky and picked up a nearly unused Gaggia Classic from Gumtree (like a UK based Craigslist) for £100 and a Mazzer Mini missing a £25 hopper and. £10 doser lid, but otherwise intact for £60.  That setup (enhanced by a PID bought new a few months later) has -essentially - remained my set up for the last 6-7 years.  Sure it's not a Rocket Giotto, but it makes reliably good espresso.  And Ive not really been tempted or upgrade (spending money instead on lever machines to play with and rebuild).

And if you've got a decent online classified site - be it Craigslist, Gumtree, Kijiji or whatever, you can do the same.  Buy used.  Aim for the best realistic quality you can.  And look local.  Typically you'll be aiming for mid-market espresso machines people got as presents and are dumping because they can't work them out.  The Gaggia Classic is a the top of the list here. And you'll be looking for semi-commercial grinders being sold by cafes that have closed down and are getting out of the business, or have bought new kit and want rid of the old stuff.  I wanted and found a Mazzer, but there are a lot of lesser known brands that can be bargains, [particularly when poorly described](http://www.roaste.com/CoffeeBlogs/sontondaman/What-Brevetto-grinder).

To show you what I mean, I briefly looked at Gumtree tonight.  On it were two recent ads:
http://www.gumtree.com/p/for-sale/iberital-mc2-coffee-grinder/1006597047

http://www.gumtree.com/p/for-sale/la-scala-coffee-grinder/1005582179

The first is an Iberital MC2 - it's a good cheap espresso only grinder that would cost £140 inc shipping new, but if you are in driving distance of Norwich you could pick up for £90.  And it would easily see you through college, or several years of home use before you got an itch to upgrade.

But the bigger bargain is the second one.  It doesn't give the model, and it needs a clean and maybe new burrs.  But if it works, for just £75 and a bit of cleaning, it's effectively a rebadged Macap M5 or MX that would cost you about £350-£500 new (depending on the model) and will give you a grinder good enough to last you for a long part of your espresso career, if you were lucky enough to live near Edinburgh.

A quick browse of London listings shows that Classics go for less than £100 http://www.gumtree.com/search?q=Gaggia+classic&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;search_location=London and even less elsewhere.  And surfing www.coffeeforums.co.uk there are guys selling well cared for _pidded_ Classics with Silvia steam wands for around £150-180.  Or (for a few £ more) you could score a basically unused Ascaso Dream, which retails for £500/$700 new, being dumped (post xmas?) for £200.  Its maybe not the perfect machine for everybody, but its solid, nice looking and cheap at the price (though you'd want to dump the pressurised baskets) http://www.gumtree.com/p/for-sale/ascaso-dream-versatile-espresso-coffee-machine-in-cloud-white--perfect/1006305955

So for less than £160/$250 in the UK with patience and a bit of work (including maybe some grinder cleaning) you could get yourself a setup with a pro quality grinder and solid entry level machine.  Or £240/$375 if you get greedy and want that PID now.

That's not zero money, but it's not much more than the cost of some dreadful cheap and nasty machine and an inappropriate grinder, that will never have a resale value and frustrate more than please.

That's not to say you shouldn't be careful.  Steer clear of dirty home espresso makers or any hint of limescale or rust.  As that suggests a lack of care on the part of the user that may limit the life of the machine.  Look for a nearly new or barely used machine, and try it before you buy it to ensure the pump works, the seals/gaskets aren't degraded and there are no obvious leaks.

Buying a grinder, worry less about the dirt.  An old Mazzer will be built like a tank and shrug off coffee grease with a microfibre cloth and a bit of care.  But do avoid buying  anything with obvious knocks that may have come from a drop off a counter (knocking burrs potentially out of alignment) or a machine that makes any squeaking or (ironically) grinding noises as it runs.  You want a machine that is quietish without beans in it, and appears to run smoothly.  Check the doser to ensure that it works without problems and that the adjustment collar that controls grind is smooth to adjust and doesn't stick or stop (except when it should).  Otherwise you should be good to go.  A bit more advice [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/14obcy/whats_more_important_for_brewing_espresso_and_why/c7fa494)

I started out used, and have never regretted it, indeed I have never owned a new machine...I can't believe you can't do the same in the US, Canada, Australia and other places with an decent used equipment market.  Don't fret about your budget.  Get out there, aim high (particularly on the grinder), bargain hunt, and get making great espresso coffee for a lot less money than you thought.
