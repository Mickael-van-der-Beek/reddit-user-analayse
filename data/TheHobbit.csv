I had a talk tonight with one of the main robotics/animatronics experts that worked on The Hobbit. If you remember the scene just before Riddles in the dark where Bilbo falls with a Goblin, this guy made that Goblin that Gollum drags around, among many other things.

After some chatting, he agreed to answer your questions in a kind of a loose Q&amp;A or AMA style. He's based in NZ, as am I, so there is no real good time to suit the US portion of our members. I have decided to open this topic as a free forum for asking questions. Obviously he won't be able to answer everything, but if you have any questions regarding the film, working at weta, robotics in the Hobbit, special effects, whatever, feel free to ask here! 

I will point him at this topic and let him answer as much or little as he wants. I'm also trying to work out a couple of other AMAs in the near future. I know one of our Hobbit friends was trying to get an AMA going with Bombur from The Hobbit and had been discussing it on Twitter.

Ok, so fire away! Ask your question here and if we're lucky he will answer :) Note that its 1am here so it may be 12 hours until he gets to answer, but if you write a question, there's a good chance he'll answer :)

&gt;**An unexpected journey**
&gt;
&gt;It is only at the end of a shoot that you finally get the chance to sit down and have a look at the film you have made. Recently Fran, Phil and I did just this when we watched for the first time an early cut of the first movie - and a large chunk of the second. We were really pleased with the way the story was coming together, in particular, the strength of the characters and the cast who have brought them to life.  All of which gave rise to a simple question: do we take this chance to tell more of the tale? And the answer from our perspective as the filmmakers, and as fans, was an unreserved ‘yes.'  
&gt; 
&gt;We know how much of the story of Bilbo Baggins, the Wizard Gandalf, the Dwarves of Erebor, the rise of the Necromancer, and the Battle of Dol Guldur will remain untold if we do not take this chance.  The richness of the story of The Hobbit, as well as some of the related material in the appendices of The Lord of the Rings, allows us to tell the full story of the adventures of Bilbo Baggins and the part he played in the sometimes dangerous, but at all times exciting, history of Middle-earth.
&gt; 
&gt;So, without further ado and on behalf of New Line Cinema, Warner Bros. Pictures, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Wingnut Films, and the entire cast and crew of “The Hobbit” films, **I’d like to announce that two films will become three.** 
&gt; 
&gt;It has been an unexpected journey indeed, and in the words of Professor Tolkien himself, ""a tale that grew in the telling.""
&gt; 
&gt;Cheers, 
&gt; 
&gt;Peter J

The only problems I have are Kili's lack of a beard, The Goblin King's death and the Wargs and Eagles looking a bit fake but other than that this movie was simply amazing. Radagast was like a mixture of the book Radagast and Tom Bombadil so he was a welcome addition.

An academic case can be made that PJ's adaptations carry over the main themes of the books whilst keeping a vast majority of detail intact. It's absolutely remarkable what he's done, but Tolkien literature is so rich in material that you couldn't possibly accurately portray all of it. I know all the differences between all the books and the movies, and you want to know the remarkable thing? I don't care. The main themes are intact, every scene is made to support the main themes, most of them are accurate to the books, and I understand the impetus behind the scenes that deviate from the books rather than knee-jerk and think ""Well that's different from the book, therefore it's bad and has no value."" Seriously, you have a diminished capacity to enjoy life if this is the reason you hate these movies. I can understand finding them boring. They are very melodramatic, but so are the books.

1371024301.0,137,self.TheHobbit,1g6n44,I don't think Smaug is real.,The_Improvisor,157,20,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheHobbit/comments/1g6n44/i_dont_think_smaug_is_real/,"Well, to be more specific, I don't think the Smaug in the new trailer is real. I don't know whether it is just a filler, a tease, a dream sequence, or what, but my theory is that the Smaug we just saw in the last few seconds of the trailer (here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFWm7JmBdmk) is not the real dragon we will be seeing in the theater on December 13th. Why? The most obvious is that Peter Jackson has specifically said numerous times that he would never show us the dragon until it's out in cinemas. One may argue that he held his promise partially, since we didn't see the ENTIRE dragon, but still, the head is the most exiting part! He wouldn't give away his big reveal so unceremoniously.

Point two is that this dragon looks nothing like the one we've seen bits of in AUJ. We can see in the prologue scene that Smaug has a crown of incredibly long horns on his head. Where are they in the trailer? Also, notice in the final scene of AUJ the two only features that we see prominently, which means that these are two things Jackson would not change. One would be the crocodilian, small raised nostrils that protrude above the rest of the snout (completely different from the triangular, huge nostrils of the dragon in the trailer). As for the eye, it is incredibly detailed and realistic, with a skinny, jagged pupil in AUJ, opposed to the trailer's cartoonish, glowing, plain orange eye with a thick, oval pupil. All in all, if you look at what we've seen of Smaug in AUJ and the head in the trailer, we have two entirely different dragons. What is really going on? Who knows. But I have a feeling Peter Jackson's got a trick or two up his sleeve to surprise us come December.

1355237626.0,110,self.TheHobbit,14o04w,"[Spoilers] Just got back from the public world premiere, at the Embassy Theatre in Wellington. My thoughts on The Hobbit, and 48fps/3D.",chimpwithalimp,124,14,89,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheHobbit/comments/14o04w/spoilers_just_got_back_from_the_public_world/,"Earlier today [I posted a topic](http://redd.it/14mmer) that I had won tickets to the midnight showing of The Hobbit in 48fps and 3D, shown in the Embassy theatre in Wellington NZ. I'm just home, 3.30am, but wanted to jot my thoughts here. I'll hide spoilers, just hover over the black bars to read them.

First and foremost let me give some words of encouragement. If you like The Hobbit book, or even the LotR movies, you will love The Hobbit. After a somewhat slow start, its pretty much non-stop story and action, and its a fantastic journey. Everything from the first third of the book is there, with some extras which I'll mention later.

**48fps and 3D**: Right from the Warner Bros title spinning in high frame rate and 3D, you know you're in for a treat. Its pin sharp, and far more ""real"" than a normal movie experience. Once the actors appeared on screen, it did take me a good five or ten minutes to start to properly like it, because what everyone says is true. Its more like watching a play or seeing it live than watching a movie, until your mind adjusts to it. The bad part of that is that the whole ""Old Bilbo"" prologue was a little ruined for me because I was far more distracted by the look and feel of the HFR than of the words being spoken. However, once your eyes and mind click into gear and catch up, you just see a beautiful, smooth, genuinely stunning movie. When the camera pans around a mountaintop or tracks the dwarves running along some hills, its breathtaking. The 3D was well done too, understated and effective. Rarely are there shots done purely for the thrill of 3D, but some notable ones are animals flying into the front of the screen, or embers in the foreground. Lovely stuff.

**Changes to the book:** I'd describe this movie as being the first third of The Hobbit, with sizeable extras. Look, there are some bits put in there that I personally would have preferred left out but I can totally understand why they are there from a film perspective. 
[spoiler](#s ""There is a new big bad guy called the Pale Orc, fully CGI as far as I can tell, who drives the movie forward by continuously chasing the dwarves to the next location."")   
[spoiler](#s ""Also, Radagast is somewhat of a bumbling comedy fool, which I didn't expect. I guess they had to get comedy from somewhere."")
For the most part, you'll like the extras. 

**CGI:** CGI has come a huge way even since the original LotR trilogy and its put to great use here. There are certain scenes as some feared that are plainly CGI, and some enemies are obviously so, but its so well done that it didn't affect my viewing experience. Gollum and the Great Goblin are especially well done - every scene with either in is complete gold. 

**The Dwarves**: Each dwarf is visually unique but honestly only a few stand out. Most are filler, from what I can see, with almost no lines and no memorable sequences for a few of them. That in itself isn't a problem, but the direction has obviously (to me) put forward a few dwarves into the limelight as being more important. I'm not talking Thorin, I'm talking Bofur. He has several emotional close up scenes, whereas some of the dwarves, I genuinely can't put a look to their name. Its as if they were made intentionally forgettable, unfortunately. Perhaps in pt2 and 3, they'll focus on others.

**Smaug**: Cumberbatch revealed on some talk show that [spoiler](#s ""you get to see Smaugs eye in this movie. There's a little more than that, like some silhouettes and such. Also, one big fright."") I'm excited to see where it goes and how they'll make him talk. Telepathy?

**The mood and atmosphere:** If all six Middle Earth movies were to be lined up with the Hobbit trilogy first, then LotR, I expect that it would go in increasing order of darkness and depression, much like the Harry Potter movies managed. With that in mind, this movie is very much full of comedy, lightness, fun but also a lot of fighting and action. The sense of bleak desperation isn't there - yet - so we have that ahead of us. A friend described it as a ""comedy version of a LotR movie"", which I think was going a little far. Perhaps a light hearted version is more correct.



After the slow start I mentioned, the rest of the movie zoomed along from recognisable chapter to another, through everything you are looking forward to, sometimes deviation to a side plot before returning. Parts of it differed significantly in look and location to what I pictured from the books. If anyone knows Figwit, he gets a far bigger part in this movie, with several lines. Not sure I liked it, seemed a little pandering to the fans, that one.

All in all, I give the movie 8/10, losing a point for the excessively slow start, and a point for what I perceive to be unnecessary diversions to the book, making for some length issues. People were shifting around in their seats at times, during some of the slower scenes.

Thoughts appreciated :)

When you look back at The Lord of the Rings, the films did the exact same thing.   The original trilogy are my favorite films of all time so I'm not bashing them, but the films are quite different from the books.   Scenes that are not in the book were added,  characters said lines that others said,  and whole portions of the last two books were switched around for the last two films.

That being said I don't think the hobbit: an unexpected journey is a perfect film and is not nearly as good as lord of the rings.  I just don't think it deserved all the hate its gotten.  It makes the Star Wars prequels look absolutely terrible, even with radagast and azog shoehorned in.

I think after the next two films come out everyone will look kinder on this film trilogy as a whole.

What's your opinion?

Thought I'd create this thread so everyone who saw can discuss, and everyone who did not get a chance can perhaps get an idea of what it was like. I'd like to start off by saying that I thought it was quite awesome! I enjoyed the bits with the special guests, especially Stephen Colbert. I also really enjoyed all the Lake Town behind-the-scenes footage, and of course the sneak peak with Gandalf and Radagast! I was also quite excited to hear that after the ""linear"" storyline of the first installment, The Desolation of Smaug will take us deeper into the story. I am quite excited for that. So all in all, after being a part of this event, I am in even greater anticipation for The Desolation of Smaug and There and Back Again. So what did you think, and how has this effected your speculation on the two upcoming installments? Thanks in advance.

Perhaps less orthodox, but still very serious and very powerful.

It helped me to remember that Radagast is a maia of the Vala Yavanna, the same Vala whose plea inspired the creation of the Ents. Radagast, despite being human in form, is perhaps more Entlike in mind than manlike. I'm sure Fangorn wouldn't think twice about animal droppings.

As to Radagast's power, the battle with the Witch King of Angmar is all I needed to see.

So I was ecstatic when my oldest decided he finally wanted to start *The Hobbit*, with me reading it to him before bedtime.

* The first night was fun, and we talked a bit about Tolkien and the story's background, but he was still on the fence.

* By the second night, he was hooked, and sang the dwarves' song with me (following the haunting, awesome tune from the recent trailer).

* On the third day, he was already talking about how excited he was to read with me that night, and started drawing Thror's map, complete with elvish runes.

* Lastnight, we got to the trolls' campfire.  Wrapped in a blanket and hanging on my every word, it was indescribably satisfying seeing him squirm and smile as Bilbo and the dwarves confronted the trolls, and Gandalf appeared to save them all.  

If you know a kid who loves to read, or is at least willing to give reading a try, I can think of few books better than *The Hobbit* to spark that lifelong passion.",,False,self,t5_2sfnk,False,,,True,t3_o49l2,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheHobbit/comments/o49l2/ive_started_reading_the_hobbit_to_my_10_yearold/,

1356380533.0,54,self.TheHobbit,15e01m,Character Arcs - Why the film won a purist over,DuncanYoudaho,67,13,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheHobbit/comments/15e01m/character_arcs_why_the_film_won_a_purist_over/,"Much of the hate for the new film has come from the fundamentalist crowd who think the characters in the movies aren't the characters in the film.  This happens  to be both 100% correct and still not a good reason to not like the film.  The story arcs from the book cannot translate to the film medium without alteration.  Due to the scope and size of the film, each character must have their own story arc to travel or else it gets boring fast and would fail critically in both the professional as well as fan's eyes.

To illustrate, let's take Aragorn.  In the books, he's confident, noble and has his eye ever on the prize.  All his angst and training and toil is behind him.  In the movies he is unsure of himself, disconnected from his kin.  The sacrifice of Boromir as well as Frodo's growth change him from reluctant heir to cautiously optimistic leader.  The next movie sees him accept his role as king by inspiring and assisting his subjects (Rohan).  He risks his life to inspire and save the world he had rejected (I often think the Anduril scene should have come at the end of TTT as a pay-off.  The Third movie is where he fulfills his destiny in spite of overwhelming odds.  After Pellenor, he could have assumed his throne and left Frodo to rot.  Gandalf would have been powerless to stop him.  That is an arc that pays out over the films for just one character.

When you see a change was made between book and film, ask yourself what effect it had on the character and not what effect it had on the story as a whole.  Often, the greatest travesties of adaptation are when a character becomes something other than was intended (Starship Troopers, I'm looking at you).  While Gimli suffers from Jar-Jar syndrome at times, his overall arc as ""insular Dwarf who learns Elves aren't totally bad and sometimes natural beauty beats forged steel and polished gems"" works.

So let's talk about The Hobbit.  This movie focuses on a few key characters in a possible crop of 15, and only two are main while two others are supporting.  For the supporting cast, we learn Balin is the old advisor who is tagging along with the princeling after a lifetime of toil brought to naught.  He sets the stage for Thorin and learns there is valor yet to be had.  Gandalf is the other supporting character who we see go from almost bumbling distrust of himself (overuse of threats when questioned at the party) to surer footing by the end.  The rest are introduced but lack any growth, a key to screen-time success.  I trust they will have roles to play before the end (all in good time).

The two main characters are Bilbo and Thorin whose arcs are intertwined like yin and yang.  Bilbo's arc is modified significantly from the book much to the purist's chagrin.  He finds his courage much earlier, but the most important part is he finds it without the ring's assistance.  Bilbo has it in him by the end of the first movie, and the removal of the saving of Thorin would make his ascent too precipitous in the next movie.  Similarly, Thorin distrusts Bilbo and only trusts himself so much that it takes multiple thumps over the head to make him realize it (confound the stubbornness of dwarves).  This could not have been done waiting to the next movie as the quest hangs on Bilbo so much as to make it unbelievable.

In the end, this movie made me realize hi good PH and crew are at crafting a movie in general.  By paying attention to the full arc of characters, they build something separate and complimentary to the books.  Compressing character development so it takes place on the screen allows many more to experience the familiar wonder, even if it is in a new form.",Spoiler!,False,self,t5_2sfnk,1356381028.0,spoiler,,True,t3_15e01m,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheHobbit/comments/15e01m/character_arcs_why_the_film_won_a_purist_over/,

""Replies to your party invitations."" At this point, I had an eyebrow raised. As it carries on, they go to talk about their relatives and such in small talk, as they both walk around doing their own thing. Frodo questions the book Bilbo is writing in, and he tells him he isn't done. Frodo grabs a book of his own, and heads outside, where Bilbo is going to take a smoke. ""Where are you going?"" Bilbo asks him. ""To Eastfarthing Woods to wait and surprise Gandalf."" Thats when it hit me.

But I have to say that a few things left me kinda perplexed; especially, since I'm a nerd that sticks to institutions and timelines, about some affirmations that left me with a bad taste.

1) In the prologue, when Bilbo narrates how great and awesome Erebor was (and nothing wrong with that), he describes it as the ""greatest kingdom of Middle-Earth. And that didn't sound too well with me; I mean, if we consider just Erebor, it's kind of a small mountain, in extension there are lots of countries larger than that, even the Shire is larger! The only way it could hold up is if we consider also all the Longbeard Dwarves living scattered everywhere, from the Grey Hills to the Blue Mountains, since Thror was King of the Durin's Folk, not just under the Mountain, right? But it's kind of stretching the point to me. Another option would be to consider the phrase as the sense of 'most powerful' and 'richest', but I'm still skeptical, since the riches can perhaps be alright in this view, but the power... I mean, Gondor hasn't fallen THAT deep, it's still alive and kicking. And I bet it had waaay more population than Erebor.

2) Of course it had to be Balin explaining the Moria part (which is correct, since he died there in a pretty stupid way, I mean, in the LOTR movie it was just a passing note, in the book he was branded as stupid for trying to return to Moria, and in the Hobbit movie he's the most cautious of the gang!). But quite frankly, that part is kinda confusing; either we take it that the battle was so fierce that almost all of the Dwarves died and only a few remained (and that would be part of the reason the other Dwarven clans refuse to help, as Thorin said), or else it furthers the subplot of Thror's madness caused by his ring, and when he dies they lost the will to reconquest their ancestral home. And why on earth is implied that Orcs only recently arrived there? In the books they had a millennia to party, since the Balrog kicked their butts!

This said and done, you don't need to tell me I'm a hopeless nerd. I already know it, and I'm proud of it!",,False,self,t5_2sfnk,False,,11-Balin,True,t3_1cjgp8,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheHobbit/comments/1cjgp8/im_a_bit_perplexed_about_dwarven_facts_in_the/,

(No spoilers),use_a_name_please,63,12,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheHobbit/comments/14sjxl/the_choice_to_film_at_48fps_bridges_the_gap/,"I just got back from an IMAX 3D 48fps screening of The Hobbit.

The change in fps is unmissable from the outset, and I struggled to believe at around 15 minutes in, that I would be able to enjoy the whole movie with the ""soap-opera"" effect. I couldn't have been more wrong. At the start of the movie there aren't bags of CGI and special effects pasted everywhere, which is why I failed to initially see why Peter Jackson had chosen to film at double the frame rate. However, as soon as you reach the first scene which uses masses of CGI, you begin to truly appreciate how much of a difference it makes.

The easiest way to describe it is that it seems to close the gap (which has up until now been really quite vast in my opinion) between distinguishing real-life characters and computer generated ones. There is next to no blur, even in busy and fast scenes. Every single detail on each CGI character is crisp and life-like, even when the character is moving around the screen quickly.

After getting around an hour into it, I completely forgot about the ""soap-opera"" effect and just basked in the incredible CGI and 3D work.


If you have the chance, I recommend watching it in 48fps to truly appreciate the amazing special effects.

1375671658.0,50,self.TheHobbit,1jpu4c,"Why There and Back Again still has the potential to be completely cannon, and my current Desolation of Smaug speculation - Let's get a discussion going!",ElrondTheHalfElven,58,8,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheHobbit/comments/1jpu4c/why_there_and_back_again_still_has_the_potential/,"Hello, Hobbits!

I'd like to start off by putting on record that I thoroughly enjoyed An Unexpected Journey, although it was not without its minor flaws in my opinion.

Looking forward to The Desolation of Smaug, I have been anticipating this film since the ending credits of An Unexpected Journey began to roll in the theater on premier night last December. Now, after seeing the first trailer, my anticipation has grown. It is looking to be a very beautiful, and yet darker, and more serious film than the first, which I think I will enjoy. The only problems I have with this so far are

-Tauriel - for some of the same reasons as Azog, actually. I think she is completely unnecessary, and I do not see the writers' claim that the story needs more ""female energy"" as even the slightest validation to pull a new character out of thin air. Tolkien's legendarium is for the most part male-dominated, but remains a fantastic, wondrous masterpiece. I think that is something that nay-sayers have to accept, or else something like this happens. Furthermore, I believe that to support the creation of female characters is to take for granted the various significant, (and sometimes quite badass) female characters already in the Tolkien universe, such as Galadriel, Lúthien Tinúviel, Arwen, Éowyn, Varda, Nienna, Yavanna, Vána, Estë, Vairë, Nessa, and more. Furthermore, her role as the captain of the Mirkwood guard could have easily and more appropriately been filled by Legolas, since he is after all the son of King Thranduil and a highly skilled and qualified person for the job. Or even by just a random male Elf, so as to prevent the introduction of a token female character, whose sudden forced significance makes her stick out like a sore thumb in an otherwise completely male military.

-More Azog - Though I knew this was inevitable by his survival in An Unexpected Journey, it still does not fix the problem at hand. More Azog means more non-cannon sequences to anticipate and put up with, which is a big inconvenience when you are a Tolkien purist with OCD who is trying to stay optimistic.

Thankfully, these are my only two quarrels with The Desolation of Smaug at this point. Everything else looks to be going in a pretty good direction, and we shall see the outcome in due time.

Now, looking even further forward to There and Back Again: I am very optimistic about this film as it stands, considering the great potential it holds. Correct me if I am wrong, but I believe that There and Back Again has the potential to be completely true to the book, or the closest thing to it for a film adaption. Here are the only things that would need to happen for that to be possible:

-Limit Tauriel's role to Mirkwood, or kill her off in TDoS - Excluding Tauriel from scenes outside of Mirkwood would mean that she would not be included in There and Back again. That is already one of the two major non-cannon roles eliminated. I am trying to see this as a possibility, however, I do not think it is very likely to go this way because of Tauriel's dialogue in the trailer ""It is our fight"" - which to me means she is eager to get involved in the conflicts happening in the outside world (i.e. the fight for Erebor). If they do bring her outside of Mirkwood, let's just hope that they don't play her role up too largely, which would definitely have the potential to put a huge dent in the purity of such sequences as the Treasure Negotiations and the Battle of Five Armies. Alternatively, giving her a dramatic, heroic death would surely satisfy the writers' cravings for a significant female role, although I doubt this will happen, as the fact that this is a trilogy opens up the opportunity for the writers to fully flesh out a character in one movie, give them as much depth as possible, and then give them a grand finale in the next, so they don't have to cram it all into one film. Nevertheless, I see the possibility of a Boromir-like sequence happening here (fingers crossed).

-Kill off Azog in the The Desolation of Smaug- I think the general consensus on Azog's presence here is negative, and with good reason. Therefore, the sooner he goes, the better. Here is why I think killing off Azog in the Desolation of Smaug would be the perfect thing to do:

-This film takes place around the middle of the book, where Thorin and company are in the thick of their adventure, and do not yet accomplish what they set out to do. In fact, they barely accomplish anything at all. Thorin's triumph over Azog would add a major plot sequence to the film that would help hold the attention of (mostly non-reader) audiences.

-It would make room for Bolg- Bolg is one of the most important parts of the Battle of Five armies. Discovering his father's death would be a great way to instill rage in him, and make him an even more intimidating and threatening antagonist for the battle that is sure to be one of the trilogy's largest centerpieces. It would also give more of an incentive for that many Orcs, Goblins and Wargs to show up, other than just the death of the Great Goblin and rumor of Smaug's death.

-It would get rid of the other unnecessary non-cannon character, and open up further possibility to make this film the most true to the book.

So that is my take on the trilogy at this point. If you've made it this far, you have my thanks. I look forward to hearing and discussing your opinions, and participating in more discussions as we learn more about the upcoming films.",,False,self,t5_2sfnk,1375673115.0,,skulburnHobbit,True,t3_1jpu4c,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheHobbit/comments/1jpu4c/why_there_and_back_again_still_has_the_potential/,

[Come join the party!](http://i.imgur.com/ZEbwhqD.gif)


We really, really appreciate everyone who's been keeping the place active and vibrant through the ""off season"" between movies. New links are coming in daily, with news, photos, tidbits of gossip and some jokes and humour thrown in for good measure. For the most part, questions about the movies are answered in detail and with good spirits, and that's something else I appreciate.


Even though the red carpet première for [The Hobbit Part 2: Desolation of Smaug](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit:_The_Desolation_of_Smaug) won't be in Wellington, NZ this year (boo!), we'll still be holding some kind of Hobbit event in December, like perhaps a picnic, meal, drinks and so on, all themed to The Hobbit and of course costumes are appreciated! We had some [fantastic efforts last year](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheHobbit/comments/13xdvo/just_got_back_from_the_hobbit_meetup_and_premiere/). More details on that to follow in the months approaching.


It would be really great if you lovely Hobbits could start thinking about any kind of party you might be having yourselves for the Hobbit release. We'd love to be invited, even if that just means you sharing a gallery of how the party went, or a story or two on what you got up to. Too many Sackville ciders and dancing on the tables? Fantastic fireworks?


I will be doing my absolute best to get back in contact with Weta, Warner Bros and 3foot7 who were so generous and helpful last time around, providing wonderful gifts and goodies, which I was lucky enough to be able to hand out to hobbits at the meetup and also post out to various competition winners. Last time around, we had [a fan art competition](http://redd.it/vx1d5) and [review competition](http://redd.it/15bo52). I plan to resurrect similar competitions this time around as well :)


Catch you around, and hopefully you're all looking forward to part two as much as we are! Roll on December!

[The official Hobbit read-along is going great](http://redd.it/qgbkr). We're currently on chapter 6, but TravellingHobbit has timed it so that we'll finish just as the first movie is released. We get a new chapter to read every two weeks, so there is plenty of time to catch up. After each chapter, there's a discussion and chat.

[Share a video of you reading your favourite part of the Hobbit here!](http://redd.it/o7kc8) A lot of people seem shy and reluctant to do this but we could always do with a few brave souls to add another video. Just film yourself using whatever you like, upload to YouTube or the service of your choice, and make a post in the topic!

[Tell us all why you love The Hobbit!](http://redd.it/o8r80) Perhaps a parent read it to you. Perhaps you found the book yourself and enjoyed discovering it. Let us know.

So this is a little late, but I finally managed to finish my review of the movie. I thought I'd try a different angle and do a critique of the differences between the book and the movie. Not line by line of course, but the ones that really change the storyline. I apologize in advance for the length and any run-on sentences you might encounter.

****

**1) The Frame Story**

Unlike the book, that was written before Tolkien wrote the Lord of the Rings, the Hobbit movies are being made after the LOTR trilogy. In both cases the makers wanted to show a continuity between the two stories; in Tolkien’s case it was by starting out FOTR with “The Long-Expected Party” (in contrast to “The Unexpected Party” in the Hobbit) and making Bilbo the first character we focus on. In the movie, it’s done very similarly, with the beginning of AUJ tying back to the beginning of FOTR.

Another thing the frame story does is give a lot of exposition on Erebor and its Fall, which relieves Thorin of the duty of blathering on about it in the Unexpected Party (which Movie!Thorin would never do anyway since he's much more the silent, stoic type, but more on that later).

I think that the frame story works perfectly and is in fact taking a leaf out of Tolkien, as the professor himself used a similar frame story for the Quest of Erebor. 

   **2) Thorin’s character arc**

In the book, Thorin is a rather pompous and long-winded character without having much reason to be so. It’s like the line the Great Goblin says in the movie: “Thorin Oakenshield, King under the Mountain! But you don’t have a mountain, and you’re not a king. So you’re nobody really.” Book!Thorin seems to act all regal in spite of this.

Movie!Thorin on the other hand is painfully aware of being a nobody and wants to rectify this. And that feeling of inadequacy makes him much more reserved than he is in the book. Movie!Thorin is also much less interested in gold than he is in regaining a homeland for his people. I think this will make the dragon sickness he succumbs to at the end more poignant. 

**3) Bilbo’s character arc**

I found the way they changed Bilbo’s character arc very interesting. In the original Hobbit, Gandalf has zero reason to pick Bilbo, he just does pretty randomly. Tolkien retconned this in the Quest of Erebor (QoE) by listing a bunch of reasons: hobbits are stealthy; Smaug wouldn’t recognize his scent; Bilbo was more adventurous in his youth. PJ clearly incorporated these things in the movie and this makes Bilbo’s arc in the movie subtly different from the book.

In the book Bilbo is your typical hobbit: he doesn’t care for adventures and when the dwarves come knocking he’s a bit flustered but he plays the gracious host all the same. He finally decides to join the quest at the end of the Unexpected Party because the dwarves hurt his pride and “he would go without bed and breakfast to be thought fierce”. He’s only late the next day because he overslept. 

In the movie, he’s altogether more agitated. When Gandalf comes by to ask him to go on an adventure, Bilbo looks anxious and immediately wants to escape, as if the mere mention of adventure troubles him. Look at the indignant way he says: “I don’t think anyone west of Bree would have any interest in adventures.”. Contrast this to book!Bilbo who’s reactions seems to be more “lol that dude is crazy and a teensy bit creepy” and actually invites Gandalf to tea the next day. And when the dwarves start coming, he almost immediately tries to throw them out again. He outright refuses to join the quest, even as Gandalf reminds him how adventurous he used to be. 

To me, this makes Bilbo seem like an ex-adventurer who’s given it up and now just wants to be a “respectable” hobbit who tries to avoid even the hint of adventure lest he be pulled into it again. But the morning after the Party, after hearing the dwarves’ song and seeing the empty house, he can’t resist anymore and finally decides to run after the dwarves.

This makes a lot of the other changes to Bilbo’s storyline in the movie much more reasonable. Hobbit!Bilbo might never have been quick thinking enough to mislead the trolls, at least not so soon into the journey. But it’s perfectly plausible that QoE!Bilbo, the one that used to run around looking for elves and knows all about Rivendell, is able to. The same goes for jumping at the orcs to try and protect Thorin towards the end of the movie. This change, IMO, is very much in line with what Tolkien might have done if he persisted with his intention to rewrite The Hobbit to bring it in line with LOTR. 
 
**4) The relationship between Elves and Dwarves**

This is another rather interesting change, which I’m not sure I really like or not. 

In the LOTR movies it’s clear that there’s dwarves and elves are generally on less than friendly terms. It would be jarring if they were perfectly hunky-dory with each other in the Hobbit movies. But the audience will also be expecting an explanation of why there’s such enmity between the two races. All good Tolkien geeks know that the canonical explanation for this can be found in the Silmarillion, which unfortunately (or fortunately depending on who you ask) PJ does not have the rights to. So for better or for worse, the filmmakers have to invent their own explanation.  

And as far as that goes, I think their version is reasonable enough. Thranduil is pretty much a blank slate as far as characterization goes, and he has plenty of reason to hate dwarves since he was an elf of Doriath. I can see the filmmakers making him a sort of Thingol/Thranduil hybrid (Thingduil? Thrangol?) and give him Thingol-esque asshat characteristics that hide a noble heart. It will be interesting to see how they handle the confrontation in Mirkwood, since it definitely can’t play out the way it did in the book. Thranduil will definitely recognize Thorin and probably will be able to guess the nature of the dwarves’ quest so I wonder what his reaction will be.

The thing that makes the change problematic to me is that they make no distinction between the different types of elves I.e. the Noldor and the Sindar. Thorin’s beef (which is a pretty recent one, a couple of centuries old compared with the canonical grudge that’s millennia-old) is with the Sindar of Mirkwood. He really has no cause to to distrust the Noldorin exiles in Rivendell. In fact, the Dwarves of Moria from whom Thorin is descended were great friends with the Noldor of Eregion, some of whom still live in Rivendell.  And the Noldor and the Sindar don’t always get along anyway. 

I guess these kind of subtleties are hard to portray on film but oddly enough it’s small stuff like this that bothers me the most. Taking out Tom Bombadil and the Scouring of the Shire I’m fine with, but stuff like glossing over the fact that Elrond is not really an elf but in fact half-elven irks me.

**5) The Azog subplot**

This is probably the change I like the least but I can see the reasons behind it. In the book, there’s really no sense of urgency until they get chased by the wargs and get rescued by the eagles. The whole journey from Bag-End to Rivendell (perhaps even up to Goblin Town to a lesser extent) is more or less a leisurely stroll interrupted by the trolls, which would no doubt annoy the critics even more. Plus, with the whole “Thorin hates elves” subplot they introduced, they need to force the dwarves to go to Rivendell.

So this change kills two birds with one stone and gives the orcs chasing the dwarves a more personal undertone (""My name is Thorin Oakenshield, you killed my grandfather, prepare to die!""). And I even get why they didn't use Bolg instead: it adds yet another character to a movie that critics complain already has too many characters *and* it leads to uncomfortable questions about how orcs reproduce. I wouldn't be surprised if they made Bolg totally unrelated to Azog. In fact my prediction is that they'll kill off Azog very early in the next movie with the help of Beorn, and that Bolg will be a connection to the White Council storyline.

So this is a change I'm totally on board with, even though I'm a bit torn about CGI Azog.

**6) The White Council storyline**

One thing that PJ likes to do in the movies is compress the timelines. In the books 17 years pass between the Long-Expected Party and Frodo setting out with the Ring. In the movie it looks like a few weeks have passed at the most. He seems to be doing the same thing with the White Council storyline. 

According to the Tale of the Years in Appendix B of LOTR, Sauron first occupies Dol Guldur in 2460 TA, ending the 400-year period known as the Watchful Peace. Gandalf confirms that it is in fact Sauron another 400 years later in 2850 TA and it takes the White Council another century before moving against him in 2941 TA, the same year as the events of the Hobbit.

Now it’s very problematic to show this on film. Why does it take so long for Gandalf to identify Sauron and for the White Council to finally drive him out? What are the Nazgul doing during this millenium? Even Tolkien does little to explain any of this except for the fact that Saruman kept counseling against doing anything about Dol Guldur. This raises another problem: if Saruman is acting so suspiciously why does Gandalf seem to trust him so implicitly in the FOTR movie?

So the filmmakers try to solve these problems by compressing the timeline even more than they did in the LOTR movies. Radagast (instead of Gandalf) identifies the Necromancer almost immediately after he reoccupies Dol Guldur, which makes sense since Radagast lives very near the area. The Nazgul aren't doing anything because they've been entombed.

Gandalf presents this discovery to the White Council. PJ doesn’t want Saruman to be acting too blatantly suspicious thereby removing the only obstacle to attacking the Necromancer, which will almost certainly happen in the next movie. So the 500-year period between the end of the Watchful Peace to driving Sauron out of Dol Guldur is compressed to a matter of months, which also makes the fall of Angmar a much more recent occurrence.

Usually this is the kind of change I’m okay with; I can see how it’s necessary, especially to reduce the amount of exposition that Galadriel and Elrond have to supply. If Elrond starts going “Well you see in the year 1975 of the Third Age of the Sun, after Arvedui Last-King of Arthedain had perished; Earnur son of Earnil led Gondorian forces against Angmar in the Battle of Fornost, that is now known by the vulgar as Deadman’s Dike…” I can just picture thousands of movie fans’ eyes rolling into the back of their heads. 

But I'm a little worried about how this affects other storylines, particularly Aragorn's. Taking out the 500 years means that the stewards of Gondor will only have been Ruling Stewards for decades and Arnor will have only just fallen, which makes Aragorn's decision not to claim the throne baffling. Though I've heard it said that if you only watch the movies, you get the impression that Isildur was the last king of Gondor and really no indication of Arnor even existing, so I guess it stays consistent within the movieverse at least. 

****

All in all, I really loved the movie and I think that the changes for the most part worked and didn't find any of them gratuitous. It'll be interesting to see how these changes play themselves out in the next 2 movies.

An article I read on *Wired* mentioned the site, and it worked really well, even for a technologically impaired duck like me.  I'm planning on doing the same with however many more videos PJ puts out before the release, then editing them all into one huge featurette and burning it to a DVD.  Some of my favorite memories of the *LoTR* trilogy are from the ""making of"" features on the DVDs, and I want to make sure I get to keep every bit possible.

I doubt I'm the first to do this, or to consider posting the result to YouTube, but for what it's worth, would anyone be interested in something like that?  It would likely amount to close to 2 hours of material - quite a long video to stream.  Let me know what you guys think, and I'll see about posting the beast to YouTube when all is said and done.

For now, I've got the first seven saved on my external hard drive, and they look fantastic.  Can't wait to watch them all again back to back.  :)",,False,self,t5_2sfnk,False,,,True,t3_upz6f,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheHobbit/comments/upz6f/would_anyone_be_interested_in_seeing_all_the/,

All right, readers. I challenge you all to a game of riddles. Well, what I mean is let's have a riddle challenge! Tons of people love the chapter ""Riddles in the Dark"" so let's make our own!

Rules: 

Post your riddle, whether an oldie or one you've made up. To answer, reply to that post.

 Riddlers, please give hints after 12 hours if no one's got it yet. 

Please be courteous in your riddles and answers. No downvoting people that have guessed right so your guess can be seen. I've got the Eagles watching out for cheaters... 

To the person with the most answers, best (most upvotes) riddle, most creative one and what ever else may take the mods fancy, I'll be giving out flair awards. If I can figure it out, it many even be a shiny icon next to you name!

If everyone likes this, we may run more challenges in the future. :)

Edit: Forgot to say when we'd give flair! How about after three days, five days and a week?


Edit the second: I've given out a couple of flair awards and more will be given periodically. I'm very impressed with the riddles we've got so far. I love the made up ones!

Edit the third: Given out ""Oldie but a goodie"" and two ""Clever guesser""s. :)",,False,self,t5_2sfnk,True,,skulburnHobbit,True,t3_j5bwg,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheHobbit/comments/j5bwg/i_challenge_you_to_a_game_of_riddles/,moderator

Although I'm a film fan, I don't go to a lot of films these days.  Not too interested in Hollywood fare, and right now I'm unable to get to see foreign language art films which are my preference.

But I like Tolkien.  A fan, but not a fan boy.  So the Hobbit was a must see.  The reviews made it sound like a failure.  Ugly.  Boring.  A dud.  

So I went...

**I have never stared in utter disbelief at a film since I was a little kid.**  There were so many scenes where my mouth was literally slack, jaw dropped.  That has never happened to me before.  Even in the most ludicrous scenes with the most atrocious dialog, something in the frame kept me spellbound.  A trickling stream here, a puff of smoke there.  Three hours flew by and I wanted more.  I didn't care what-- just let me continue experiencing that world.  Maybe a pie eating contest at the Shire.  Anything!

Cognitively the film had its flaws.  But in terms of a movie going experience, I was completely floored.  There were moments of such beauty, I thought ""Here is something glorious in the world..."" and my eyes started to well up.  It broke through my very cynical nature.

In one early scene the Dwarves smoke pipes and sing a mournful song about their wandering.  Smoke has never been seen like this before!  The song, the smoke, the singing, the looks on all their faces --you believed it when Bilbo chased after them the next morning.  You were there, and you wanted to go, too.

At the end of the film, the eagles are carrying the party to safety.  Holy mother of god.  I can't explain it.  Not only of course the depths of extreme height, but the beauty of the raptors themselves.  

I sat in my chair, stunned as the credits rolled.  I left the theater, after buying 12 tickets for my friends for next weeks showing, a believer in what had just happened.  

**Why did this ""renew my faith in humanity?""**  Because the three film project is so monumental and such a risk that rightly it should not even have been attempted.  But not only was it attempted, it was a triumph.  My experience of the film was one cinematic victory after another.  

The vast technologies required should never have come together.  But they did, thanks in great part to the success of the original LOTR films, and Avatar that developed and proved the 3D technology.  But even so, the Hobbit could have been a very modest offering for a modest adventure.

There is a cyniccal modesty that moves people to propose the Hobbit should only be one film, or only two films.  

&gt; The Hobbit is too long.  It's boring.  Nothing happens.  I hate dwarves singing.  There are too many details.  Radagast is not in the book.  The plot doesn't move step by step like other films I like.  They made three parts to make more money.

Yet this risk of length that allows the film to actually approximate the works of Tolkien, to let all those stories within stories to work their way through.  What movie executive in their right mind green lights the following proposal?:

&gt; Yes, I want the film to feel like the audience is *reading* the Hobbit through the combined lenses of the Lord of the Rings, the Silmarillion, and unfinished tales.  

That is exactly what the Hobbit is!

&gt; But don't worry, it will only be 9 hours long.

Just picture the movie executive staring out the window, wondering where the hell he's going to work when his movie studio goes bankrupt taking the risk of making a half-billion dollar gigantic mess that flops at the theater.

People have this thing completely backward.  From a risk perspective, it makes much more sense to make a two part film than three.  Two parts are ample to adapt the film.  Three hours is a huge risk from a studio perspective.  It's hundreds of millions of dollars on the line.  But three parts means all the Silmarillion tie ins and LOTR tie ins that make the film epic.  

What a victory for storytelling over streamlining a product.

Take the sequence at Bilbo's hobbit hole.  Executives watching this had to fight against it.  You know they must have argued that it was too long, and delays the action.  But it's in there!  Who would have thought patient meandering would ever make its appearance in a Hollywood blockbuster?  Not the sped up homey feel of the Shire in LOTR, but the cinematic equivalent of lounging around Bilbo's house like you have an afternoon to burn kind of thing.

I got the sense Jackson sat before the studio heads and said, 

&gt; Let's not be modest for a change, let's risk everything.  Let's put away the MPAA lawyers and fight piracy with excellence that makes people believe in cinematic story telling.  

And it happened.  It's real.  I'm a believer.

In the film, just before the company is nabbed by the goblins, Bilbo makes to sneak off and abandon the dwarfs. This stuck out to me as being horrifically inaccurate to the book, and I was hoping to use it is as a comparison/contrast between the book and movie in a Film &amp; Lit class. I've read the book a few times, and have flipped through it again several times to try to answer this, so I'm just trying to get your thoughts as well (I am doubting myself). Apart from him sneaking off to try to end the battle towards the end, does Bilbo ever attempt to leave them in the night and go back to Hobbiton?
Many thanks to whatever expert can definitively answer this Q for me.  **EDIT** Thanks for your input everyone. This has definitely helped erase my uncertainty on the matter!

(NO spoilers),Wintopi,37,8,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheHobbit/comments/14wtr3/hfr_the_only_way_i_ever_want_to_see_any_movie/,"I saw it 3D IMAX first thing on opening day and then again today (the next day) only I went to the HFR showing.  Before the movie started I was prepared to have to ""get used"" to the difference.  About 15 minutes into the movie I remembered there was *supposed* to be something I had to get used to.  There wasn't.  I tried to make my eyes see something ""different"" but the only thing they reported back was that the image was bright and crystal clear.  The one and only thing that I truly noticed was that I never had to adjust my 3D glasses trying to see better like I constantly do in regular frame rate.

After the film ended I found myself surrounded by happy fans with quite a range of ages.  My sister had gone with me and has a terrible time with 3D, which frequently gives her a headache.  She too thought it was clear and had no adjustment problems.  She wears trifocal glasses that are a problem with regular IMAX 3D, but no problems with HFR.  She compared it to seeing an incredible stage production.  I started polling the people around me and they all reported how much more clear it was and how they couldn't figure out why some reviewers were complaining about HFR.  I ran into a group of about 8 young adults standing outside the theater and as I put my glasses in the recycle bin I heard them saying how much they liked the HFR and hoped that it would become the standard.

Unless you have a vision problem that HFR impacts I think you will appreciate how much better it looks.  The action is clear, the colors are bright and for the first time ever I was able to forget I was watching a movie in 3D.

Ps. the movie rocks!

**Edited to beg:**  Please respond with your impressions on your *visual response to HFR* and not criticism of the movie.

Details inside...,chimpwithalimp,32,1,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheHobbit/comments/vx1d5/we_have_some_winners_for_our_hobbit_fan_art/,"Firstly, a huge thank you to everyone who took part in our fan art competition, either by submitting your own work or by voting for other peoples work. This is the kind of thing that turns a subreddit into a proper community and it went very smoothly.

I have totalled up the votes and it was a very close run thing. We had two main contenders for first and second place and it came down to just a couple of votes in the end. Third place was even closer, with four entries all within a vote or two of each other.  

**Without further ado, the prizewinners!**  

--------

**First place :**

[FlintFlame](http://www.reddit.com/user/FlintFlame) with his excellent [Hobbit Fan poster](http://i.imgur.com/IJ7RI.jpg)! 

*Flintflame wins a [24x36 inch map of Middle Earth](http://i.imgur.com/CVdW8.jpg), kindly bought and posted by the wonderful [travelinghobbit](http://www.reddit.com/user/travelinghobbit).*

**Second Place :**

[xanthe93](http://www.reddit.com/user/xanthe93) with the imposing [Smaug the Dragon](http://i.imgur.com/ml9h8.jpg)!

**Third Place :**

Congratulations! All prizewinners will be contacted immediately to arrange details.

For the curious, here's the original request for entries [topic](http://redd.it/sp8e9), and all of the submitted entries can be seen [here](http://redd.it/vjxpw), but please be aware that voting has now closed. 

I'd just like to take a second to thank all of you lovely hobbits. We're growing very fast, almost 100 new members a week. If you have any ideas on how to improve the place, or thoughts on future competitons, projects or general Hobbit shenanigans, please let us know! Make a new topic or [just message the mods.](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FTheHobbit)

Keep an eye on the sidebar for current and forthcoming Hobbit community projects, and lets keep growing in the right direction.
