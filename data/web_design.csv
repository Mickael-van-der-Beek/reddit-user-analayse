But, after checking in with a few designers I know they weren't entirely educated about this, I feel this is SO important I had to emphasize in the title for those few who may have slipped through the cracks like myself. After fixing this, I literally went through every PSD on my computer, shocked in horror as my designs improved a hundred fold when I changed this one setting.

Not to toot my own horn, but I am pretty damn awesome at photoshop, yet I have always found a pitfall in my ability with fonts. I realized this needed to be addressed, so I went out and bought 3 excellent books on fonts and read them all. This helped tremendously. I also watched a introduction to typography [video](http://tv.adobe.com/watch/max-2011-design/beautiful-typography-a-crash-course/) from adobe, and somewhere in the middle he talks about kerning.

The problem this whole time was related to my use of fonts: I had kerning set to 'zero' which, in my mind meant, ""dont apply extra kerning values, use the default ones"". In reality.... a value of zero kerning means ignore the kerning pairs (spacing for various combinations of letter forms) that the font developer has spent hundreds and thousands of hours perfecting, and apply an exact kerning value of zero, aka make my design look like complete shit.....  Thanks to reading those books though and watching the video... I have the knowledge to see now (quite glaringly) how bad it really looked the whole time, and very subtly too—where I couldnt quite put my finger on it. I always thought it was color, value, placement or something else and nothing would seem to fix the slight disharmony in my designs.

To fix this, make sure you have no documents open (or it wont apply globally with a new document is made, only to the current document), then select Window &gt; Character. In the kerning box, click the dropdown and set it to 'optical' or 'metrics' instead of 0. 

http://i.imgur.com/se4Ym.png

You will want to use either of those, depending on the typeface/font you're using. If it's an expensive typeface, or a classic 'pro' typeface, you will most definitely want it on 'metric,' which uses the kerning pairs that the typeface creator has meticulously crafted every combination for, in multiple font sizes.

If you're using a cheap or free font, theres a good chance the designer didnt put extraordinary amounts of time into the proper kerning pairs for every combination, so you may want to go with 'optics' which means Adobe will calculate it best for you. Note that script fonts dont work with optics because they wont fit together perfectly most of the time as its supposed to look like one long stroke of a pen, and adobes calculations will be a tiny bit off, making the font appear unattached.

If you want to see how different this looks, I made this image to show. Obviously if you're a typeface wiz you would have figured this out long ago. Thank god I (and others) found this out NOW rather than destroying more designs with uneducated typeface decisions.

Example 1 (Minion Pro):

http://i.imgur.com/QO94w.jpg

Example 2 (TodaySHOP):

http://i.imgur.com/TOG4W.jpg

I would also recommend watching the video above, it has some great information. Another setting you will most definitely want to change for bodies of text is in the 'justification' settings. He talks about it in the video (right after the section on kerning), and while I rarely have images of blocks of text on a webpage, it still pops up occasionally and the improved justification settings magically make it look 100x better as well. He gives you the best values in the video too

**Real TL;DR:** In Photoshop, set kerning to ""metric"".  Setting it to ""0"" makes stuff [look bad](http://i.imgur.com/TOG4W.jpg).

**Edit:** For all those who are in uproar about using Photoshop with fonts - I do WEB design which involves a lot of photo manipulation (eg. things like sliders which usually are text over photos which can be touched up, and have a small amount of text as a part of the image). If  I'm designing anything else... a print ad, a print or brochure page layout, a logo, anything with paragraphs of text or even letter art, etc, i dont use photoshop.",,False,,t5_2qh1m,True,,,True,t3_lkiic,http://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/lkiic/i_have_designed_for_years_without_realizing_this/,

I told them they had just lost a customer. He replied saying:
&gt; Fantastic. Perhaps you can sign up with a hosting provider who doesn't take privacy seriously then. Enjoy.

It irked me that he didn't seem to care about lost customers, and I replied that it was supremely unprofessional, and now found myself in an argument as to *why*.

What followed was the most unbelievable thing I've ever seen a company do. He said it had nothing to do with unprofessionalism - and then **suspended my account**, that of my friend's, and I got an email saying I could ask for backups if I wanted, but that all of my sites were now down.

Clearly whoever runs This* cannot deal with their customers - they can't separate the personal from the professional, and if they get pissed, they delete you - the specific reason in my friend's email for termination? ""Twitter nonsense"".

I'm still shocked by this exchange...

Create a platform and API for invites and events. Connect it with mail and the calendar. It has to be deadpan easy to use, both for developers and users, so that means you have to redesign the google calendar while you're at it. It has to be serious enough so you get the business sector to trust it enough to build dependent services and products. Kind of like google maps.

You have all the parts, if you connect them you have the chance to become the leader of a serious event/invite networked tool. Currently I'm looking at Facebook to see what's up in the weekend. Making a system for planning events is more of an engineering task, and that you google could be doing *so* much better than Facebook. Using Facebook as a calendar feels just wrong.

The website is called www.efficientscholar.com and when you go on it after it loads you have to type **""up up down down left right left right""** on your keyboard to access reddit. I worked really hard on this site, and I did my best to make it look professional. Do you guys like it? and any suggestions?

I made it so when you hover over the right half of the screen, wikipedia (or any website you even want) appears. So you can seem like you're doing school work when a teacher is coming behind you.  And also when you look at the history, it just says ""Efficient scholar"" So then if someone looks it's not like I'm doing anything bad. 

&lt;strong&gt; edit, I really appreciate how encouraging you all are, but being critical- and knocking me off my high horse is how I'll become better. Please give me design advice and coding advice if you have any =3 &lt;/strong&gt;

I sincerely hope you guys like it as much as I have enjoyed making it.

I have seen the same question over and over on web_design and webdev over and over every month. About 6-8 months ago I decided to make the 'end all be all' website that serves as a central hub for all tutorials/tools/assets... quite a large task, but if you don't set challenging goals why bother? :)

It has voting and favoriting similar to reddit, although it is NOT for discussion based articles.

It also has tagging by topic, similar to stack overflow.

Signup isn't necessary, but if you decide to i only ask for email and username. There are zero paid listings on the site, and no ads. I'm going to keep it that way as long as possible before the server bill gets into the mid $xxx range.

**Click on 'about' at the top to learn all the main features... there's a few hidden gems in there that aren't apparent just by glancing at the site.**

While I appreciate C&amp;C, I'm not gonna lie, I have poured my soul into it without any help from the outside about the direction, so I'm somewhat nervous for feedback.

Here you are! 

http://pineapple.io

PS. I encourage you to add some resources that aren't on there. You (temporarily) don't need to create an account. It will remain this way until i start to get spam to make it incredibly easy to add things.

Edit: At the very least, check back often! New stuff is added every day

Edit: I know currently they all say 'popular'. This is due to the site exploding and redefining what my subjective 'popular' criteria is. This will be adjusted along with other revisions when the traffic has died down and I can implement some other changes people have suggested.

I was referred to someone and sent him a proposal. Met with him and his people twice in lengthy meetings, one which involved me doing a presentation.

I don't hear from him and assume he went with someone else.  

Two months later he contacts me saying he needs help fixing the site urgently.  I look and see he had some one try and install a Wordpress template and clearly didn't know what they were doing. It appeared he took my proposal and used it to do the work internally, then realized it was too hard.  So now I am supposed to give a cheaper proposal to just ""finish"" the work  since he now has ""done the hard part"". 

I tell him it is harder to fix the issues they created then start over and the price is not going to change.  After a few minutes of him arguing with me, he then tried to illicit sympathy. Then he tells me he will tell all his friends to use me and I can put my link on his site. SMH

Ok so obviously at this point I'm done. I politely tell him I will have to pass on his project.

Here is where it gets good.

He asks if he can ""use my Indian"".

I was like wtf?!? What Indian??? 

He apparently thought my Polynesian partner was Indian and wanted to hire her directly and if not could she recommend a reliable Indian worker. He says that she would appreciate the work and he would even pay her $10 an hour.  He was dead serious and truly thought he was making a reasonable request.

So yeah, Today was the first time I hung up on someone.  Anyone want the job? ;)",,False,,t5_2qh1m,False,,,True,t3_1jt7z3,http://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/1jt7z3/my_truly_unfunniest_client_moment_to_date/,

Cheers!

-elzi

EDIT: Thank you all so much for the feedback. I'm extremely excited to keep working on this. Here are some things I've gathered.

1. The more and more tools I add, the more I risk clutter. Clutter could be avoided if there's a better system in place to allow users to **easily see what's best/popular, such as a reddit style upvote system**. I would then have the default landing page sort by most liked. This could also have the result of new tools being undiscovered.. but I could make use the of the (currently unoperational) NEW section for that.

2. **Easy or no registration.** I hate making new accounts just as much as the next guy, so something like cookie-based or OpenID would be lovely. Facebook Connect... eh, no thanks. 

3. **More information at a glance &amp; perhaps comments.** Maybe instead of sending you right to the site, clicking a site-box (not sure what to call them at this point) could bring you to a page with more details on the site. For example, If it is unclear what the utility does, tell the user what they could use it for. Comments would be helpful too, allowing users to link to things they have created using the utility. 

4. **Page real-estate is my enemy right now**. I will have to redesign the boxes a little bit to fit more stuff in. I'm trying to stay original but they will probably end up looking a lot like Dribbble's.

1263401348.0,303,self.web_design,ap64b,So you want to freelance? Here's a couple thoughts from a guy who used to freelance and now owns a company.,white_bread,349,46,117,http://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/ap64b/so_you_want_to_freelance_heres_a_couple_thoughts/,"• You can try and market yourself to end clients like the local real estate agent, a dentist, some random musician, a car dealer, or whatever but in the long run you're much better off trying to find repeat business working for web development companies or ad agencies. Why? Because that dentist is an amateur will somehow find a way to drag a 2 week project out to 3 months. With these one-off sites you'll do so much more work for the same amount of money. If you freelance for an established company they will manage the client and they will manage you: you'll receive assets on time, your goals will be clear, and so on. 

• Develop a one page portfolio. People are busy. No one has time to figure out your site. Be grateful that someone read your email and clicked on your link. Everything they need to sum you up should be contained in that click. Name, location, contact, and work examples. 

• If someone has an add for a full-time person do not send an emailing saying you'll work off site. This is a loser move.

• If you are not from the same location as your client make that clear. 

• Do not make me use a form to contact you. Use a normal email link. 

• Be clear about your hourly rate. If you don't, right now, know what to charge by the hour then you should charge $30. I can hear the insanity starting up on this one but let you tell you why I say 30 bucks an hour or less (design, Flash, development it doesn't matter). If you don't know what to charge you don't have a lot of experience. In fact you don't have any at all. Currently I receive about 50 applications for an advertised $15 an hour job (you'll need to make 2x a salaried person). One third of the people who apply have a degree, a few examples of completed work, and are very in need of work. These people will also be slow when I pull them in and will take a couple months to understand how to build a billable product. So, if you are just getting started and know a few languages or can build a little Flash this does not mean you should expect a senior rate.

• Once you hash out your rate and the scope of the job from your client bill 50% down before you get started. This is totally common ESPECIALLY with new clients. many of the freelancers who work with me just drop an invoice at the end of the job because they know they're going to get paid. If there's no previous relationship then take care of business: it's your responsibility. 

• 80% of your work will come from 20% of your clients. So, if you land a gig with an agency or web shop, do a good job because most likely they will bring you back at some point. If you do a website for the balloon shop down the corner you will never hear from them again (rule 1) but they may refer you. Don't forget that. The goal is repeat business not fighting for every single job.

• Pay you taxes. No really pay your taxes. You will slowly drive yourself into debt if you don't peal off 20% to 30% of your invoice and hand it to the IRS on a quarterly basis. If you don't have the discipline to do that then forget freelancing altogether. I'm dead serious about this. You are basically running a small business. Freelancing isn't just a cool way to work from home. It's hard work and you have to have your shit together. People will pay late. Your cash flow is going to be all over the place. Even if you get 80 bucks and hour for a job and feel like your getting somewhere you have to understand that you rate will be cut in half because you will NOT work for that same amount of time. Effectively you are making half of what you bill THEN you have to pay taxes on that and you need to get your own heath insurance.

Freelancing isn't something you do casually. You need your game face on 24/7. Work for companies not clients. Be clear on who you are and make that easy for people to see on your portfolio. Bill 50% down and stay on top of your taxes. 

Good luck.

EDIT: Thanks for the positive feedback. If you wanted to turn this into a casual IAMA I'm cool with that. 

ABOUT ME: I built my first site in '95. It was published in a couple magazines and a book. Later I freelanced with not a whole lot of experience but somehow managed to feed my wife and kids. After that I worked at a small digital ad shop. Finally I started my own business. I've hired a lot of full-time and freelance people and I've seen a million portfolios.

When I did sign-up for amtrust.com, their welcome email is from ""onlinebank.com"", and it tells me to enter my social security number and personal info at a fifth website ""mynycb.com"" which then re-directs to a different domain after I login! 

That's 6 different domain names.  And none of these were a phishing attempt ...  these are all *actual websites* that all really belong to the same the actual NYCB bank!   What a ridiculous mess!

No wonder it's so easy for hackers to send emails that trick people into logging into fake bank websites.  It's sad when a bank's legitimate websites are more sketchy than ones put up by scammers!  Shame on you NYCB, and any other companies that do this!

Here's the contract: [Contract](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zjnALucdNoEX4k2YdohPIgOZcpFXTVR70oYjqvw6Lj8/edit)

Please give me some advice here. I've had a terrible morning. Here's some background information:

I used to work for a very sketchy, has been sued many times, construction company. *Can I list the company here to show you sketchy reviews or is that breaking any laws?* When I finally left them 3 weeks ago, I offered to make them a website for $1,950 under a contract. They agreed, signed the contract, and today was the due date. There was also a $585 deposit before I continued the work, which I received. 

Throughout the 3 weeks, they've been TERRIBLE at giving me the content I've needed to do the website. I've been forced to meet with the two employees in order to finally obtain information for the website, and to have them view it. The owner, who signed the contract, never attempted to try to set up a meeting -- and has never contacted me at all during this time. The main employee was the one arranging the website details. I've shown both employees the website numerous times and have attempted countless times to have them tell me everything they need to be put on there. One told me they loved it and that it was wonderful, the other one said it was great and that they'll send me more stuff to put on there soon. They made it very obvious that it wasn't a priority to them to do so. 

I finally received pictures LAST NIGHT to be put on the website, and again, they failed to come through with the text content. I've attempted to write up as much of the content as I could so that I can present it to the owner with something on there. As far as the website goes, all layout, coding, and design is completed. 

This morning, I went in to show him the website and he SCREAMED at me. Told me it was shit, I was a stupid spoiled bitch, and fuck you. I told him that the contract states he has up to two revisions where changes as far as content and pictures can be made, and he wouldn't let me talk. 

He continued to say, ""fuck you, you stupid bitch, the contract doesn't mean anything, I want the deposit back."" 

**I said that AS THE CONTRACT STATES, the deposit, if you wish to terminate the contract, is forfeited. He said he's going to take me to court. It even states in the contract that the client (himself) will pay all lawyer fees.** 

So this is really long but, WHAT THE FUCK. I did everything I could to make sure the website was done on time and did my best to make it look amazing. 

He told me to ""get the fuck out and give him the deposit otherwise I'm taking you to court.""

So I left, reviewed the contract, and sent this email:

------------------

[CLIENT], 

This morning, you expressed dissatisfaction with the redesign and layout of the new website for www.website.com. As it states in the contract you signed, ""This contract includes one main design plus the opportunity for you to make up to two rounds of revisions. If you're not happy with the designs at this stage, you will pay [ME] in full for all of the work that they have produced until that point and you may either cancel this contract or continue to commission her to make further design revisions."" To reinstate, at this point, you can either cancel this contract now or I can continue working on this site (up to two revisions) after I've received all content and necessary changes from you (all images, text, and certification information) through email, dropbox, or a flashdrive.  

In terms of the deposit, the contract states, ""If, prior to completion of the project, the client observes any non-conformance with the art plan, the artist must be promptly notified, allowing for necessary corrections. Rejection of the completed project or cancellation during its execution will result in forfeiture of deposit and the possible billing for all additional labor or expenses to date."" Since you are unhappy with the new website, I will waive the second remaining payment that was due today if you wish to cancel the contract. The deposit of $585 is non-refundable, as the contract states. 

------------------------------


These people are terrifyingly moral-less and I regret doing business with them in the first place. But, what do I do from here? 

**It also states in the contract:**

**""Client shall bear all costs, expenses, and reasonable attorney's fees in any action brought to recover payment under this contract.""**

So I'm covered in case he tries to bring it to court, right?



EDIT
----

I just got a call from one of the employees saying that they want to go through with the 2 revisions. He said that it's going to take hours of work and that he wants to sit with me to do it. I said that it clearly states in the contract that revisions are up to 10 minutes and only include text, pictures, etc.

How do I make sure that I can clearly identify two revisions so I fulfill my end of the contract? What power do I have to cancel a revision request? HOW DO I PROPERLY DISCUSS AND DO REVISIONS WITH A CRAZY PERSON?

If it comes to the point where I say, ""fuck it"" after meeting them tomorrow and end up doing the refund -- I want to make sure I cover all my basis and DOCUMENT that the refund was given. How do I do that properly and protect myself?

The CEO of the company responded saying they liked my work and would like to hire me to design their mobile application. After a series of delayed email over a month I finally had a phone call with the CEO and agreed verbally to start working on a page for the fee of $65/hr. Later, I asked her to sign a written contract just to be sure, which she agreed to sign after their lawyers reviewed it. 

So, I designed the screen and before I could submit the work - the CEO emailed me saying they had found another designer who would work immediately. 

OK, well besides being a huge waste of time at least I would get paid for that screen, right? Wrong. The CEO claimed she was ""new"" and inexperienced and apologized for stringing me along. When I submitted an invoice for my work, she replied **""Did you seriously just send me a $xxx invoice?""** quickly followed up by **""Please send your claim to our legal team: legal@xxxapp.com.”**  I was absolutely shocked. Not only would I be receiving no pay, but she would insult me by trying to muscle me with her non-existent legal team? I responded by saying I would rather write a blog post asking for advice which she responded with: 

**“I figured :)”**

So my question is: can I do anything about the situation? The CEO agreed verbally and tasked me to start working right away - which I did. I sent a written contract for them to sign, which they also agreed to sign but never did. After 3 days of work, the CEO refuses to pay and points to the unsigned contract. 

I’m very tight on money right now, due to an impending move to the Bay area. I took a significant pay cut to work for a YC company because I respect and appreciate the program and it’s founders. However, I was strung along and then dumped by an immature CEO who wouldn’t even compensate me for work she asked me to do. What can I do?

On a side note: If any startups are looking for part-time designers, I am now available.

I can't believe the sentiment coming out of the Reddit Community! It has really gone a long way in raising my spirits.

In the end it's 100% my fault for not being cautious enough and being absolutely crystal clear. I'm willing to chalk the entire situation up as a misunderstanding. I should have waited for the signed contract instead of rushing to work.

Thanks for all the helpful advice guys! But, really - this has gone way too far for a relatively minuscule issue.

So /r/web_design tell me how do you work?

I myself did some web design like 8 ~ 10 years ago and what i can see is that there changed a lot. Designs look much much better. I always started with Photoshop and from there I exported the design so I could edit the HTML. 

What I think, after seeing a lot of templates, that this isn’t the usual way anymore (correct me if i’m wrong). So I was wondering how the Designers work now, do you guys always start from scratch? Have you a library with snippets? 

Here are the following what I was curious about:

* How do you export from Photoshop? (if you use it)
* What program are you using for editing? (I have Coda 2)
* How do you write you CSS? (Do you start from scratch?)
* Do you have a lot of snippets? (I have some but not much)
* Which sites do you follow?
* Do you have other tips?

The PSD is fully layered and vector based. I also included a mini-tutorial on how to create complex shape paths using Illustrator and Photoshop.

I'd like to give something back to this great community. I sell my templates on Wrap Boot Strap, another great community. I'd like to give away one of my templates for free for all the great people on Reddit.

Here's the url of my wrapbootstrap portfolio. https://wrapbootstrap.com/user/littlesparkvt

I'll leave it up to you guys to pick one, just leave the one you want in the comments below and the one with the most votes will be free for 24 hours. I might ask for an email address or tweet in return, but you won't have to pay any cash for it.

So there you have it, start looking and let me know what one you want. 
Thank you so much for all your help along the way!

Again, here are the templates:
https://wrapbootstrap.com/user/littlesparkvt

Edit: THANKS FOR ALL THE POSITIVE FEEDBACK! LOOKS LIKE METRO IS ON TOP SO FAR

Edit: WOW, DIDN'T KNOW IT WOULD CAUSE THIS MUCH OF A STIR

I'm aware there is another template/framework called boot metro, no relation to the one I'm giving away. 

If you see a theme on wrapbootstrap that you like, it doesn't have to be one of mine, please buy it. It's one dude doing that site and he's really nice and a great help. Free stuff is good, but supporting the people that put a LOT of hard work and effort into their templates is totally worth the 15-20 bucks. Plus the free stuff doesn't come with support ;)

Time for bed, thank you all for your support and great comments. Hope you enjoy the template!

so I immediately go to the website and see its fine. I call him and he is swearing that when he goes from page to page he is seeing his personal information and porn. He said he was making edits and suddenly all that started showing on his website. I was confused trying to think of some weird glitch with his browser. 

Finally I do a screen share and ask him to show me.

I see his website then he starts to hit the back button on his browser which of course takes him to other pages he was on. He thought that was all his website still! 

I explained how the back button on his browser worked.  He obviously felt pretty silly but mostly because he just got busted looking at porn. He has a great sense of humor and can laugh at himself, even told me it would make for a funny story (leaving his name out of course)

Now you might think surely support should help me out somehow, this is insane if they left me like this, right? 

I have to pay some stupid $9.99 just because I can't switch off the privacy setting in Domains by Proxy?

They feed on people who are lazy or not bothered to waste their time lurking through the dungeon that is their god-forsaken website.

And the result... it took me a week to realize I've failed, Godaddy has won and I can't do anything about it.

Here's a JS hack that will append .ie10 to your html element so you can still target.

    &lt;!--[if !IE]&gt;&lt;!--&gt;&lt;script&gt;if(/*@cc_on!@*/false){document.documentElement.className+=' ie10';}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;!--&lt;![endif]--&gt;

**Update for all the people wondering about the code I was using:**

Apparently it was caused by sizing things in rem's using [Snook's method](http://snook.ca/archives/html_and_css/font-size-with-rem). According to Snook's logic, use rem's freely and [browsers that don't support them](http://caniuse.com/#search=rem) can fall back to px-based sizing. Well, IE9 and 10 support rem's. Unfortunately Microsoft renders rem's according to it's own borked math (different than every other browser).

IE10 still doesn't render things like ""every other modern browser"" ([according to the IE dev team](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/07/06/html5-parsing-in-ie10.aspx)) but now it's almost impossible to cleanly target IE10 specifically without JS.

Basically, you can't use rem's or target IE10. Thanks for ignoring us web developers again Microsoft! :D",,False,,t5_2qh1m,1352903743.0,,,True,t3_134z07,http://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/134z07/so_ie10_just_released_a_preview_for_win7_its/,

I'm starting this thread as a self-post (my first actual post on Reddit, btw) so we can talk about it without having to worry about whether I'm karma whoring, or trying to drive traffic to a website that I actually run, or whatever it is that so often turns OP into a bundle of sticks. 

There is nothing dodgy, spammy, or tricksy here. I just want to talk about website valuation for a minute.

EDIT: I'm not going to get all sensitive about upvotes/downvotes because I know you're all just as cynical as I am, but please let me know if this is something you guys don't care about, and I'll stop talking. At this point in my career, I'm just as interested in the business side of our work as I am in the actual production, but I understand that r/web_design may not be the best forum this conversation.

EDIT2: Sorry to wander off yesterday. We had company drop by unexpectedly, and by the time I was done with that, I was exhausted and just went to bed. I guess I was kind of a bundle of sticks after all, but to make up for it, I'm now going to go read through (and upvote) each and every comment and try to reply as lucidly and helpfully as possible.

Life, Web Design, Career Path and Salaries.",grasswillbegreener,206,33,94,http://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/1fvb3i/graphic_designer_confused_about_everything_life/,"Bless your soul if you read any or all of this. I have no idea where I'm going with this just need to get all my thoughts out. Rant/Confused/Scared. (Along the way if you can think of another thread I should post this in please let me know. I am sorry if this is nonsense for your sub reddit. I will delete it if it is.)

So I'll just be honest with everything. You can shit on me if you'd like. Help would be appreciated. 

So from a young age I was always very artistic. When college came around the only thing I knew I was good at and had an interest in was art/design. So I chose to go to a four year school for Graphic Design. I chose GD because that was what I was good at not necessarily b/c I loved it.  

I (not to brag) was always putting out the top designs in my classes. Unlike many other designers I had a natural talent to draw. 

Summer before senior year I got a job as the graphic designer at a very small start up tech company. I was so excited to get the job b/c I basically beat out anyone from my school who applied. I loved the job and felt important and was working there part time 20hrs a week while going to school my senior year. I even got to travel a bit. Made $15.50 an hour. And at the time it just felt like a lot. Lived in a house with my friends a nurse and engineer. I thought I was doing fine.

Company hit hard times. And always the first to go was design in marketing. Me. 

In the span of about 2 months. I lost my job, had to move back home and to top it off my girlfriend dumped me. Just wasn't doing good. 

That was 3-4 months ago and it's a thing of the past. I've been talking to my friends more and more about salaries. And what I thought 40-50K a year would be a good salary isn't in there mind. 

The one's who are saying this are the nurse, engineer, and another in law school. 

So I've been applying to jobs... the few that are out there. I'm using craigslist mostly, indeed, behance. But there all the same jobs posted. 

I have my portfolio up on Behance and I am proud of it. I have like 7,000 project views, many nice comments, and one of my projects was featured on a curated site. I look at some of my other peers from school landing jobs now and I'm just flabbergasted. Their portfolio's are so amateur that I'd be embarrassed to show them. They have maybe a hundred or so views, no comments, no awards. Anyways they are landing jobs some how. I'm happy for them and glad to! If they can get a nice job I should to right. 

I live in the Boston area btw. 

So I've been searching a few months now. In January I had an interview and did an assignment for them. They told me they'd get back to me but never did. 

Then I was contacted by a marketing agency to help with a new web product of theirs as a freelance graphic designer / contract work. I had no idea what the hell I was doing with all this freelance stuff. Anyways we had a couple meeting face to face. He put off our start date for a few weeks. I grew worried. He asked for my hourly wage and I said $25 an hour (something he asked before and told me he had a guy asking for $250 an hour.) Texted and emailed 3 separate times and no answer. Been over 2 weeks now and still nothing. Obviously I started looking for work again. It just really struck a nerve that this a$$hole could just blow me off like that. Even a simple email ""hey, get lost, bye"" would of been better. 

So here I am dazed and confused. Now I'm starting to doubt if I chose the right career path. For the past couple years I KNEW Graphic Design was my thing. I wasn't pretending to be something I wasn't. I was artistic. I was creative. But now I'm just having so many doubts. 

It seems that before I went to college. GD was a career path on its own. Now when I'm job searching everything seems to be GD and Web Design. 

Now, I enjoy coding and making websites. But all I know is the basics of html and css. 

I've read it enough on /r/web_design to know that a degree or certificate for Web Design is a waste of time. I was looking at ITT Tech or Northshore for classes and it looks like they cover the knowledge I would need to land many of these jobs that lump graphic design and web design together.


I feel like the only way I can make a good living doing design is if I become an Art Director, UX/UI Designer or Web Designer/Developer. Salaries there range from 60K+ A very nice living!

So I have no idea what the hell I'm doing. I'm starting to feel like 4 years of GD was a waste. I should of just went to become an engineer or nurse or business major. 

Am I just getting discouraged from looking for work? 

Would I be happy if I just had a job and felt relevant again? 

Should I try out a temp agency like ""The Creative Group"" or ""Creative Circle""? Just to get my foot in the door, build connections and gain experience? 

Am I being a whiny little bitch? 

I thought Web Developers paid well. Am I wrong? Should I try to get into that field?

How do you even become a UX/UI designer? Is it like being an Art Director where you get where you are from time and experience?

Should I try to get a certificate in Computer Science? Will that help me?

What the hell would you do in my shoes? 

Also PM me and I might share with you my portfolio. 

Wow, Thank you so much if you read all this. 


**EDIT** Wow you guys! The feedback I've been getting here at /r/web_design is amazing. I know you guys are all strangers on the internet but you are really helping someone out here. I just want you to know that. 

What I've learned:

- Networking!! I need to use a Guerrilla style approach. ""Visit offices and hand resumes and portfolios to important people, introducing yourself professionally."" Stop with the online ads and get my face out there. Or join a staffing agency to get my foot in the door. 

- Web Design is a solid career. Its always going to be there and growing as long as the internet is around. Work on Graphic Design (It's a good foundation to have.) while learning about web design in my spare time. 

- Don't give up. Being unemployed/laid off sucks! The economy is rough right now. Don't take it personally and keep working at it. It's just a tough time right now and I'll make it through. 

**EDIT #2** All I can say is I'm so humbled by everyone's passionate responses. I had no idea that so many of you have either been in my shoes or are currently in my shoes or can't even find your shoes.

I hope everyone is gaining some insight here and not just me. I'm reading all of your comments and still everyone is bringing something new to the conversation. 

I just checked out www.teamtreehouse.com and it looks like exactly what I should be doing with my spare time if I'm not working on my portfolio or networking. Also someone recommended I watch some of Micheal Locke's (UX/UI designer) videos. His sight has something similar for only $89 http://mlwebco.com/website-design-training/ and there is also Lynda.com.

What do you guys think about these sights? Do you have any others in mind? TreeHouse seems to be the best just from how professional and well thought out everything is on their end. 

Really everyone I can't thank you enough. Friggin' Reddit and /r/web_design. You guys are rockstars. 

**tl;dr** Graphic Design graduate. Trouble with the job search. Thinking of going back to school for get the knowledge for Web Design since so many of the job postings now just group the two together now.

I'm a reasonably successful developer but I want to improve my web design skills. Things I don't understand very well are all the little tricks people use to get certain layouts but I think I could learn these over time as they are in the same class as development difficulties.

 * Colour
 * Typography
 * Icons
 * Creating high-fidelity mockups
 * Layout (choosing good layouts, mechanics of creating them not so much)

I want to create designs like say [this site](http://phoneify.com/), but I don't know where to start to improve my skills. I was already a very good coder before I started coding professionally. How do I become a good designer?

""I'm a website designer"" I said, and he immediately handed me back my license.  ""Want to get out of a ticket?"" he asked me.  

Turns out he was a vice cop and was investigating some guy with a bogus web-based business in our area and he wanted to know if there was some way he could find out who owned the website and when it was registered.  I told him how to find the WHOIS for the site and he thanked me and sent me on my way.

Today is definitely my lucky day.

Evidence was overwhelming, the database was disconnected. Even still, going to keep an eye on them for the next week or so, to make sure he doesn't try again. I've got documentation of this DMCA complaint and its success now, so if he pops up again, the next time, I'll get things shut down even quicker. 

------

Woke up this morning and found an email from one guy telling me someone is reselling one of my designs. He lists a couple of sites, I thanked him and started to investigate so I could file a DMCA. I noticed that each site had the exact same text, and that there was one specific unique phrase as well. I googled the phrase and...

193 results. 

...Its. Too. Early. For. This. :(

To make things worse, 95% of them are hosted on the same two Hostgator servers, but of course, being that the occasional one isn't, I have to sort through each one to make sure I send the DMCAs correctly...

**Update:** One down. Yes, it's only one, but still. ONE DOWN. 

**Second Breakfast Update:** One of sites with the pirated design contacted me and demanded that I cancel the DMCA complaint, because, as they put it, ""we paid for it already, not our fault its pirate"". And is now telling me that he will just ""sell it more"". I've forwarded his emails as more evidence to HostGator. Dumbbutt.

When i first bought a domain from GoDaddy, I chose to pay $15 for 3 sample months of hosting, with a guaranteed money back if I didn't like it. Two *days* later, I look at my account. After receiving my payment, they switched my account to a month of free hosting, a trial they give out by default. in exchange for this, they throw an obnoxious banner to the top of my website. 

I was put on hold for upwards of half an hour, then told that there was nothing they could do (WTF?). So there goes $15. 

This week I was doing work for a client whose domain was hosted by GoDaddy. I suggested moving to HostingPad, a cheaper hosting with much better support. 

Well they moved the domain...sort of. GoDaddy moved it on *one* of their 4 servers. to *one* of HostingPad's 2 servers. therefore, you basically had a 1 in 8 chance of getting the correct website when you went to the URL. The other 7 times, it would find an obnoxious GoDaddy advertisment. 
This was based on my IP Address. So on one of my laptops, I could pull up the clients website consistently, and on another, I couldn't ever. After 3 or 4 calls over about 3 days, I finally sorted it out, and fixed it all. 

Sometimes I wonder If bullshit tactics like these are the way GoDaddy keeps their prices low. Does anyone else have stories this bad?

I own and run [VlexoFree](http://vlexofree.com). Its a free web hosting service that has two plans to choose from. *Personal 300* which offers 300MB of space and 5GB of bandwidth; this plan is usually for small personal sites. And *Expert 2000* which offers 2GB of space and 20GB of bandwidth/month; a nice plan for big or business sites.

Heres a short list of basic features:

* [PHP 5.3.3](http://vlexofree.com/info.php) (I keep this up to date)
* MySQL 5.1 (with MySQLi)
* PostgreSQL
* Perl
* CGI
* Python 2.4
* Python 2.6
* Python 2.7
* Ruby on Rails
* [99% Uptime](http://www.pingdom.com/reports/s8tmf2n6m6go/check_overview/?name=VlexoFree)
* [Full List of Features Here](http://vlexofree.com/wiki/Features)

I do have a requirement for both the plans (sorry!). For the Personal 300 plan I require a linkback on all displayed pages. For the Expert 2000 plan I require the same as the personal plan plus an ad. Nothing is forced on your pages so you can choose where you want to put everything. I do this because I need to support my service somehow and I dont get enough donations to get rid of them.

I have an ad-free ($5/month) plan you can also choose. Compared to asmallorange.com you're getting a lot more for less.

I'm working for free every day on this service and I don't run VlexoFree for profit; I run it to give people who don't have money the opportunity to have a website. Due to that, if you enjoy the service, donations are very welcome.

If you don't need hosting please don't sign up for an account.

Ask me any questions you got.

I think thats everything you need to know.. [Feel free to sign up](http://vlexofree.com).

A WYSIWYG (Dreamweaver, iWeb, Frontpage, etc.) is **OKAY** if you want to start, to see what every tag does, etc. But if you want to do anything worth it, forget it.

The only thing you will get with a WYSIWYG is a bunch of css classes (style1, style2, style3, etc.), weird javascript (espacially for AJAX), and forget about anything optimized for speed like CSS sprites. 

If you want to build a little site quick and cheap, go for CMS and templates that you can customize. But please, keep of from Dreamweaver etc.

    console.table([
      {""name"":""Ricky"",""age"":33,""grade"":10},
      {""name"":""Julian"",""age"":34,""grade"":12},

You can also provide a second parameter if you want to pluck certain columns. **console.table( trailerParkBoys, [ 'name', 'grade' ])** or just **console.table( trailerParkBoys, 'grade')**.

Lots of these companies invest an enormous amount of money in UX testing to improve their conversion rates, etc.

Every time I see a mocked up re-design of reddit or craigslist, I barf a little because the designs aim to change the way I currently interact with the site (by moving things around, making things 'easier' or 'more intuitive' but realize if I have to re-learn how to use your new interface (re: new user experience), I'm going to be immediately turned off). Re-designs need to take gradual steps so that you are kind of walking the user along the way into what you ultimately want to change the experience to.

They tend to be people that either don't value web design as a service and thus pay pennies, or simply want as much as possible for the dollar they pay to the point of being unreasonable.

A current client treats me like how one would think a short tempered person might treat some new Indian telephone tech support jockey.

Once she accused me of possibly running a scam, twice I gave her clear schedules but she just exploded angrily on why the site wasn't done days ahead of schedule, out of nowhere. She also constantly sends me content to put on with vague descriptions such as ""Put this on the box on top"". She of course is a cheap client and I made the mistake of accepting it on whim.

I told her I'd show her how to update with Wordpress in the future, but she just emailed back with ""Oh so now I have to design the website myself?"" I never said any such thing.

I've found loads of online blog posts etc. that list ""30 great free fonts"" and that kind of thing, but a lot of them are original or funky fonts, which is fine, but I am more interested in getting together a list of reasonable free substitutes for the classic fonts that we see around us every day. Baskerville, Garamond, Caslon, Helvetica, Futura, etc.

I have been googling for specific fonts, like this: ""free helvetica substitute or alternative"", and had some luck that way, but there are some that I've not found any reasonable equivalents for.

So, I thought it would help others to start a post listing the ""equivalents"" I'd found. I realise they're not likely to be exactly the same, but if they are very close, then they will go on the list until something closer is found. Hopefully too, I can get some suggestions for both filling in holes in my list, and for perhaps new additions to the list. My goal is to amass as comprehensive a list of usable free fonts for general purpose design as I can.

One future option may be that if I sell a web design or logo using one of these free copies, to buy the ""official"" font from adobe or wherever and build an official collection gradually that way. Currently, I have a massive pirated collection of fonts from bittorrent, which is very useful, but I feel bad about it and want to fix it.

       - Unfortunately, Microsoft has added a clever new
       - ""feature"" to Internet Explorer. If the text of
       - an error's message is ""too small"", specifically
       - less than 512 bytes, Internet Explorer returns
       - its own error message. You can turn that off,
       - but it's pretty tricky to find switch called
       - ""smart error messages"". That means, of course,
       - that short error messages are censored by default.
       - IIS always returns error messages that are long
       - enough to make Internet Explorer happy. The
       - workaround is pretty simple: pad the error
       - message with a big comment like this to push it
       - over the five hundred and twelve bytes minimum.
       - Of course, that's exactly what you're reading
       - right now.

 He said in a snug manner ""I sent you an e-mail about this but I guess you haven't checked it yet.""  

Me:""I never got your e-mail, are these updates effecting e-mail as well?""  

Him:""uh, yeah. I guess so."" I just hung up.  

Needless to say we will be finding a new host.  They never even notified us that they are performing updates that will take down our server in the middle of the work day. WTF 1and1?

Edit: Thanks for all of the great advice folks. We didn't get any notification about this but it could be they have an old e-mail for a contact. I'm going to fix that.  Total down time ended up being around 25 minutes, so not the end of the world. (or my job, that could of gotten hairy)

Me and my brother have been playing with this idea of making a new subreddit specifically for **feedback on websites**.

We have the feeling a specialized subreddit for this would work because there are lots of people who want feedback, but a big and widespread subreddit as web_design scares them off, or their topics get easily burried.

Let us know what you guys think! If we get enough upvotes we will try and open it =).

I politely explain these are not minor changes and remind them about the sign off sheets and tell them the cost to make the changes.  She gets attitude and tells me nevermind to go ahead and launch as is.

Now Google Plus, Facebook *and* Twitter are doing it.

- It breaks ""find on page"" (ctrl+F) on some browsers.  If the page has to scroll to show you your highlighted search term, the highlighted words are hidden underneath the fixed-position header/footer so you can't actually see what you've found.
- It reduces vertical screen real estate.  Once I've scrolled down, I don't need to see the header anymore, and it's taking up space.  This is especially bad on 1366x768 or so laptops where vertical space is more limited.
- It makes scrolling less smooth.  Especially if you are on a slightly older computer, or a computer where your browser is not hardware-accelerated.
- If done badly, it is totally messed up on mobile phones or any other devices with small screens.  I've seen fixed-position side panels which are unusable even with 768 pixels screen height.  Consider: if they don't fit on the screen, it's impossible to scroll them.

1341719056.0,134,self.web_design,w7hl2,Adobe Business Catalyst: I need to warn people so that no one falls into this trap.,Fluck,168,34,88,http://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/w7hl2/adobe_business_catalyst_i_need_to_warn_people_so/,"Sorry if this has been posted before, or if it's obvious to most people... but I wish I had seen a post like this because it could have saved me many hours.

I've used a couple of different CMSs, and none at all, and recently it was decided that Business Catalyst looks simple and easy enough to quickly throw together pages for clients who didn't want larger, more complex sites.

Now I'm helplessly trapped developing and supporting Business Catalyst sites, and these ""simple"" sites became huge projects with reduced functionality.

1. No server side logic at all. There are several exceptionally restrictive modules that can be barely manipulated with extreme perseverance and a willingness to spend huge amounts of time coding workarounds, but even these, in the end, cannot do MOST things required to create a professional website that adheres to a planned design. **If you want to display anything on your page conditionally, be prepared to spend many hours writing unique Javascript and manipulating modules to spit out data in hidden divs, class names and other stupid places.**
2. Support is terrible. Finding out how to do the most basic things is excruciating. Their help and documentation seems to be distributed across a bunch of different domains.
3. If you google for solutions to simple problems, at least half of the links are posts to Adobe's ""wishlist"". These are usually requests for basic tags that are standard in any CMS, and go unanswered for 5 years whilst being signed by dozens of people.
4. Most of the other half of those results are questions on Adobe's own support forums that have been moved. Therefore, the largest and most useful source of support for this product is found on pages that automatically redirect you to their ""new"" forum homepage.
4. The provided modules (galleries, forms, product catalogues etc.) are worse than useless unless you want to use them *exactly* as they look and work out of the box. I say worse than useless because it's about 4 times more difficult to alter those modules to be displayed in a specific way than it would be to simply create these things from scratch in any server-side language or CMS.
5. Tables. Everything is in tables. The modules consistently vomit tables onto your page, so even if you thought you could completely change the layout of the ugly modules provided, you'll be stuck within the confines of a table.
6. With all of the workarounds, javascript and different modules required to do stick to basic designs or use the most simple conditional logic, manipulating content from the client's perspective is a complex nightmare. Expect to write exorbitantly thorough documentation or spend a lot of time doing phone support...

With all of these things in mind, if you're planning on porting a site over from/to Business Catalyst from any other kind of system, you will find yourself redeveloping most, if not all of it, from the ground up. Even huge swathes of your CSS will break if you intend to use menus, forms or any module at all, because BC provides its own (usually unchangeable) class names and IDs. It could be helpful that some of the classes are called generic things like "".menu"", but often you'll realise those classes already exist and are in use in other parts of your site...

This extremely simple functionality is impossible:

    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;{left content}&lt;/div&gt;
         &lt;div&gt; This is static text, the same on all pages in the template&lt;/div&gt;
         &lt;div&gt;{right content}&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

If you absolutely must have a website but you can't afford professional quality and you did an IT class or two in highschool, this may possibly be of some use... but I could absolutely not in good conscience recommend this after developing and maintaining a few sites in it.

**TLDR: Don't use Business Catalyst. Don't let anyone you know use Business Catalyst. If you have a time machine, go back to the board meeting where creating Business Catalyst was being discussed, bring a chainsaw and just... express yourself artistically.**",,False,,t5_2qh1m,False,,,True,t3_w7hl2,http://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/w7hl2/adobe_business_catalyst_i_need_to_warn_people_so/,

Are these server-side or client-side? 
Are they dependent of certain scripting languages or systems such as PHP, Ruby, Python, Node.js?
If not, can they run along side other systems?
Do these frameworks manage databases? If so, which systems.

* **The Industry Radio Show**
A podcast discussing web-design industry news and techniques. It’s new and appears to be pretty useful (example: episode 2 gives a pretty neat summary and introduction to SASS)

* **The Big Web Show**
The Big Web Show is hosted by industry superstar Jeffrey Zeldman. It’s not one of those very practical shows throwing specs and quirks around. More of a laid back interview-style series with relevant people from the industry. You can pick up freelancing, authoring, project management ideas but gets nerdy at times (mostly depends on the guest).

Last year, the professor gave me a client who said she needed a big database application made. That was all the information I got from the professor. I was pretty excited to meet her and see what the project entailed.

After meeting up with her and talking to her, I realized that all she needed was to make three simple surveys that she would send out for a research project. The first red flag probably should have been the fact that in order to make this she was trying to create multiple Access databases with a new table for each question (I can't even fathom how she thought that was anywhere near the right thing to do). 

So I talked to her and assured her that her needs did not require the use of an Access database. We agreed to use Google Forms in Google Drive, and I made the first survey for her to show her how it was done. It met her needs completely, and I even gave her detailed instructions on how to create a similar survey, add new questions, and what the different question types entailed. Simple enough.

This is where the shit hit the fan, and fast. She started emailing me every day asking me new questions. Asking me about stuff that made no sense, telling me about unrelated conversations she had with people involved in the research project, asking me to help her recover the survey because she accidentally deleted it, and - worst of all - bothering me with questions about using alternatives.

Now, remember, this is a **SIMPLE FUCKING SURVEY**. Equivalent to *""Question 1: Please rate how good your day was on a scale of 1 to 5""*. Google Forms isn't great but it can definitely handle that. And now, I am answering emails left and right about whether or not she should be using paid alternatives. I told her that free is always good, and her needs did not require the use of anything more complicated than Google Forms. 

Long story short, she didn't listen. And now, after **six months** of this ""project"" being underway to make her three surveys (not to mention more questions), she emails me saying that the alternative she picked was way harder to use than Google Forms and she is thinking about switching back. She also tells me that the deadline has passed and she needs to make a decision.

I am not about to hold her hand while she asks me more questions about making the transition back to Google Forms. I look in my inbox and realize that I have answered probably in the ballpark of **100** emails about the surveys and have not been paid since the initial time we met up. So I fired her. I replied to her email and said that I have clients who a) pay me and b) listen to the advice I give, and told her that I can't afford to be answering all these questions about a simple survey without getting paid.

tl;dr - I fired a client who was extremely high maintenance and wanted 24/7 help without paying for it. I wasn't charging her for emails because I usually don't, but she ended up sending me over 100 questions via email. Massive waste of time.

So my questions to reddit are (had to edit formatting here): Have you ever had to fire a client? What was the final straw? How did you handle it? Have you ever charged for time when it comes to excess amounts of emails?Do you think firing my client was justified?

Let me know what you think. Like I said above, I've never had to do this before and I could use some advice from designers with more experience.


**Edit:** I still have received no word from the former client. But, seeing as how part of the email stated something like ""please assume that I don't have any time to answer further questions"", I might not *ever* get a response. Thanks for all of the advice and stories about your personal experiences. I'm glad I'm not the only one who has had to do this, and I will implement the use of contracts in further design projects. Additionally, thank you brainzz for being the first person to kick my ass on this subject. I watched the video and bought the book that Montiero wrote.

Just tired and wanting to move on, I did the great sacrilege of putting it back on the new site. But it behaved oddly so I decided to inspect it and lo and behold, I found a surprise.

The script is a free script the previous developer found on this site: http://www.webtutoriaux.com/compteur-visiteurs.html

The site looks relatively clean and even trustworthy to some extent.

The script to add looks trivial:

    document.write('&lt;IMAGES OF NUMBERS&gt;'); document.write('');

So far so good, nothing evil here.

But if you actually open the source of the page, there's a little more going on:

    document.write('&lt;img src=""http://webdezign.tutoriaux.free.fr/images/Compteurdevisiteurs/affichagequatre/zero.gif""/&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;img src=""http://webdezign.tutoriaux.free.fr/images/Compteurdevisiteurs/affichagequatre/zero.gif""/&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;img src=""http://webdezign.tutoriaux.free.fr/images/Compteurdevisiteurs/affichagequatre/zero.gif""/&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;img src=""http://webdezign.tutoriaux.free.fr/images/Compteurdevisiteurs/affichagequatre/zero.gif""/&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;img src=""http://webdezign.tutoriaux.free.fr/images/Compteurdevisiteurs/affichagequatre/trois.gif""/&gt;&lt;/img&gt;');

I don't have an answer that would satisfy any real developers.

Anyway, I think Git would be the best, however it's confusing as hell to get started because most tutorials assume you are familiar with other repository solutions, where I am not. I understand the classic concept well enough (users upload code to a central server). I also understand that Git uses a more flexible method that can model Subversion/CVS but can also use a more complex hierarchy. 

I work with two other developers (both less advanced than myself). We've all worked together for more than 2 years, and no repo in sight. From what I've heard, this is very bad.

_Tools we use:_

* Windows 7 to develop on (not my choice)
* Netbeans IDE (my coworkers)
* Sublime Text 2 (myself)

_Things I've done:_

* Made a github account
* Installed a Git plugin into Sublime Text
* Installed Git EXE to the default directory (I don't understand the implications of this)

_Things I think I understand but don't know how to do:_

* I would like to push all changes to a network drive, but I don't know how. I don't actually want to use GitHub because our source is closed and we are too cheap to pay Git private hosting.

_Things I have questions about:_

* Do repositories only handle code? What about non-code resources, like images? (especially important for websites, of course). 

This is a throwaway account because there's no way I'd post this hideous info on my real account. I'm a disaster waiting to happen. Oh, if you're wondering, we have no backup solution (at all), so this is my attempt at trying to rectify that. Website gets hacked? Tough shit, that was our only copy.

Color Hexa (Http://www.colorhexa.com) is a site where you can input hex, rgb, and/or hsl data and you will get a LOT of informations based on that color. From gradients, to hsl, hex, rgb, monochromatic, dichromatic, trichromatic, colors close to that color you name it.

My friend and I invested a lot of time and money into starting our own web hosting service. We planned, designed and installed everything for quite a few weeks and we're ready to launch.

But before we put any money into advertising we want to build a decent client base. That's why I figured to give out some free hosting to members of my favorite community.

To see the plans, terms and the rest go to: http://hostclipse.com

We'll be giving out 4 months of Personal Starter pack to you, and if it happens that you really don't have money after those 4 months, we'll probably extend it for free. To get free hosting send us an email at support[at]hostclipse.com with title ""Free Hosting"", and you will be given a one-time 100% discount coupon.

Edit: Forgot to say I asked one of the moderators for permission before posting this.
Edit2: We will *host* your domain for free, but we can't *register* it for free.

**EDIT 3: The offer is now closed.** We have gave out around 50 coupons! Thank you reddit for many kind words, and nice tips!",,False,,t5_2qh1m,True,,,True,t3_i71hz,http://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/i71hz/free_premium_hosting_for_redditors/,

I've been thinking about a decision that most interactive sites have to make but which seems to be made unconsciously.

Consider a site that has a shop.  The user adds things to their ""basket"", then pays for it all in one transaction.  One page on this shop is a list of basket items, where the user can remove unwanted items.

A link to the basket page is part of the navigation.  Now, what is the text for this link?  Most sites will lump for one of the following:

1. ""Your basket""
2. ""My basket""
3. ""Basket""

In option (1), the service provider is speaking to the user.  In option (2), the user is speaking to the service provider.  Option (3) is a passive phrasing that avoids a choice of speaker.  There are many other examples of the same thing.  ""My account"", ""my settings"", ""cancel my order"", and so on.

How does one decide between these options?

Some sites choose inconsistently.  An example that sticks out is on sites where, after I log in, it says something like, ""Hi James!  (I'm not James)"", where the parenthesized section is a link to log in as a different user.  The first section is the service speaking to the user, and the second is the user speaking to the service.  To me, it sounds weird.

In general it seems like choosers of option (2) must necessarily be inconsistent because writing the whole site text in the form of option (2) would be absurd.  ""Your server is down for maintenance, so I should try again later.""  Most text, it seems to me, must be of the option (1) form.

Can we identify a clear class of places where option (2) is appropriate while surrounded by other a majority of text of type (1)?  The prime candidate is a link which is an action: the user is speaking to the server, saying ""please do this for me"", e.g. ""place my order"".  However, we also get form submit buttons with the phrase ""place your order"", which sounds less weird to me than I thought it might.

For the same reason, it seems the use of option (3) must be sparing.  Is it only acceptable in the same category as option (2)?

Basically, I'm looking for some best practice guidelines.  Other people must have thought about this.
