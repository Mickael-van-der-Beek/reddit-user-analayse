1368910350.0,1867,self.mindcrack,1elfjs,Why I Roleplay,generikb,2980,1113,544,http://www.reddit.com/r/mindcrack/comments/1elfjs/why_i_roleplay/,"With today's recent posts about B-Team's roleplay-heavy videos, and seeing so many comments like ""pandering to kids"", ""doing it for money"", and ""being fake""...I figured now would be a good time to explain a little bit more about me, my background, and why I do the things I do on my channel.



disclaimer: This is about me, not bdubs.  I won't speak on his behalf here.



As a child, Mister Rogers was my hero.  For those of you too young (or from another country?) to know who that is, he had a children's television show.  At the beginning of every episode he would come in, change sweaters and shoes...while singing ""It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood"".  He had the most calming, nicest voice imaginable.  And pretty much every episode he would talk to his friend Trolley (who was, as you can guess, a cable car trolley) who would then go through a little tunnel and into the land of Make Believe.



It was the most amazing thing ever when I was young.



My other childhood hero was/is my father.  He is a cowboy, a comedian, a zen master, and the greatest dad a kid could ever have.  He taught me how to be kind, loving, respectful...and gave me my sense of humor, patience, and self-worth.



I don't have kids myself.  My wife and I are 38 years old, and I love her more than any boy could ever love a girl.  But children unfortunately aren't in the cards for us.



But I like kids a lot, and when I started my youtube channel (well more accurately, when i realized people were actually watching my videos), I knew that I wanted to be as kid friendly as possible and as entertaining to kids as possible.  



I wanted to be Mister Rogers: an inspiring, friendly, educational, wholesome entertainer.  And I think on the whole I've stayed true to that goal.  Sure, there might be a swear word here and there during B-Team episodes...Call of Duty or Leisure Suit Larry for sure aren't meant for a 5 year old...but on the whole I'm pretty close to my goal.



Which brings us to the role playing...



Role playing isn't about being fake, it's about telling a story.  It's no different than watching some of your favorite TV shows (what, you thought Game of Thrones was a documentary?).  Minecraft specifically is a perfect platform for roleplaying too.  You can build your own sets, dress up your character, and do practically anything you want.  And the kids *love* it, which going back to the beginning of this post is exactly my goal.



But I also recognize that I have ""adults"" who watch me as well.  You don't watch Mister Rogers, and I wouldn't expect you to (unless you're high or something).  That's why only a percentage of my stuff is role play.  

 

Some of you in the other thread were complaining that there's too many ""Wars"" going on...but if you really look at it, the majority of my Mine Wars and Emerald Wars have been about building things.  



In Mine Wars, I built a unique minecart elevator, a power drill, an automatic sissybar and charcoal maker (the last two thanks to designs from my fans).  



On FTB during Emerald Wars, I built a very compact industrial TNT machine, showed you guys a ton of bee related stuff, and even went into detail of some lag inducing things we found that might help others with similar issues.




As a final thought, I want to share with you part of an email I recently got from the mother of a 5 year old that is a huge fan of mine:



""I homeschool my kids, and this year I made up a little geography curriculum for my son (who adores/is obsessed with you) called ""Around the World with GenerikB"". He loved it because I used your Minecraft skin on the worksheets I made up and it was about the-hermit-that-knows-nothing being thrust upon an unknown country and he doesn't know what to do. It was up to my son to teach Genny about the country he was in. It worked very well for us.



I am actually going to be doing something else this summer called ""On the Road with lil Genny"" - we are going on a couple long road trips and I will require him to take photos of a little stuffed GenerikB I made and create a photo journal with them, perhaps making a story with the pictures. I haven't completely flushed out this idea yet. I am hoping this keeps him occupied so I don't hear ""Are we there yet?"" every 30 seconds.""



I'm a grown man, but that really moved me.  This would make my father very proud of me.  And as long as I keep getting feedback like that, I know that I'm on the right path.



I don't do it for money, but I'm thankful I can make this my full time career.



I don't do it to pander to kids (definition of pander is ""To cater to the lower tastes and desires of others or exploit their weaknesses"").  Mister Rogers didn't pander to me, he loved his job and he loved kids.  I'm no different.



And I'm not being fake or untrue to myself.  If you still think so after reading this, please unsubscribe from my channel and never watch my videos again.  I don't need or want you as a viewer.

I uploaded a video of a dating game called Katawa Shoujo, the game itself does contain some nudity, but I always make sure to censor it very carefully so as not to go against Youtubes guidelines. The latest video contained a half second scene of exposed breasts where I made an honest mistake in the editing and did not realise it. The content was then flagged and I received a community strike. Up to this point I understand everything, from then on it gets strange. Youtube tell me I have a strike, this is my first and only strike. Youtube work on a multiple strike system and yet after only one strike I find my entire account terminated without any chance to explain or fight it. I am distraught, this is my job, my main source of income. It happens at a bad time (on the weekend) as my network (Maker Studios) are not in work. At first I felt like nothing was happening, then Totalbiscuit (A Youtuber) steps in and helps me out with his contacts and gets the ball moving a lot faster. Maker studios sends me an E-mails gets me a contact on Skype and I am being kept informed of the situation by them. Currently we are waiting on responses from people in the network on what can be done and why this had happened. I see no reason that I should not get back my channel for something that is clearly a giant mistake on Youtubes part.

Now I want to know why my accidental nudity causes the closure of my channel. While other Youtubers are free to expose nudity and much worse content without blow back. Does Youtube work on a double standard? It can choose to ignore its own guidelines so long as they are getting good money out of it. Will I receive any kind of apology from them? Not only for the loss of income, but also the mental and physical strain this has put on me. I have had a non stop headache and have hardly slept at all since this started. I have quite literally worried myself sick over something that I consider to be entirely Youtubes fault.

Until they admit they are wrong and reverse this great abuse of their own system, admit that they have a flawed system and will change it. I see no reason to let up on the pressure and messages towards them. Let them never forget what we are feeling at this moment, and how disgusted we are that they feel it ok to treat their users with such little regard.",,False,self,t5_2to85,False,,specialMillbee,True,t3_1kahpm,http://www.reddit.com/r/mindcrack/comments/1kahpm/what_is_happening_to_my_channel/,

Stop commenting on every single video of us which is not made by etho, that etho made this and that already and what not. I started to delete all these comments by now, cause it just gets on my nerves. IMO, it gets way out of hand and I wished you would use your head a bit before commenting. Good exampe what I am talking about. In his last episode, etho showed that he did thaumcraft research. Now, I get tons of comments saying. Sorry doc, but seems like etho outsmarted you guys again. He already has researched all thaumcraft stuff and you other guys ""down there"" are still trying to do the research. So, etho is up there? And we are ""down there""? You cannot even build a derp tower anymore without somebody saying ""etho made that"". I am sick of it and it pisses me off as etho is my friend, but this I cannot tolerate anymore. It is disrespectful and rude and stupid. Many other mindcrackers have addressed that in videos before, so it is a general problem. Nice of you guys you are trying to represent etho, but believe me, most of the things etho does we already know days in advance before you guys see the videos. Do you think etho is some ghost that never talks to us? Etho also addressed that in his videos, he is not fond about it. The prime example when it really got bad, was when pause got spammed for months with ""pause hates etho"" messages. If you browse the tubes and see somebody using etho's inventions without crediting, well go ahead and let em know who made it, aight...but please, restrain yourself with all the etho did that crap on the videos of us other mindcrackers. I am trying to convey the message calm and friendly, and I have better things to do than blocking people, but if it doesn't stop and I have a bad day, I might strongly react in the future. Just wanted to share my  POV here and I don't wanna be in the shoes of a smaller channel who has to deal with stuff like that. GenerikB also gets bombed with messages like: If you have some questions about bees, just ask etho. FYI, generikb is way ahead of etho when it comes down to bees. So , did generikb outsmart etho ""down there"" now  or what? Or anderzel and nebs? What about them? Respect people is all I am asking for and I hope some of you guys will understand. I see endless comment chains of people trying to shut these comments down which tells me many people understand where I am comming from just now. Don't you realise that your create bad carma for etho with that? Ppl get annoyed by it as well, not only us the content producers. The reaction to that then is, comments on etho's videos saying ""tell you fanboys to chill a bit"" and what not. So, it is an endless cat and mouse game of viewers and devides the mindcrack community.

I want to add to that. The same of course happens to me. Somebody sends me a nice design, I go there check it out and give it a like. Then I make the design in one of my minecraft LPs, check back to the video a few weeks later to see how the channel does..and what do I see. Comments saying, you stole this design from doc..argh. So then, the idea behind trying to feature designs of others in the world tour makes no sense, if the people I try to feature or point out get accused of stealing. 

So many people play minecraft and only the combined brains/ideas of all these people make these crazy contraptions we love so  much in the game. One design is based on another, minecraft evolution. Some people might stand out a bit from the crwod because they do youtubes or what not, but they lso just play the game. We are trying to provide entertainment, we are a group of friends on the server. We don't want to be pitted against eachother, or compete or battle. The youtube competition is tough, and within the group we try to stick together. 

I am in general pretty emotional and decide by my feelings. Maybe, it annoys me so much because I hate the idea of competing with my mindcrack friends. 

It would be much apprecited, if you see comments like that, don't rage, don't get mad as I maybe too often get, just tell them in a friendly way, that it is not important who did what first or when or how. It is mainly about fun and sometimes you might  learn a thing or two. It is possible, you can try to influence people, doesn't matter if young or older, it just needs persistance;-)",,False,self,t5_2to85,1359991640.0,,specialdoc,True,t3_17v079,http://www.reddit.com/r/mindcrack/comments/17v079/a_request_from_a_fellow_mindcracker/,

Season 1 was Guude's singleplayer world in the late Alpha stages of Minecraft. It ran from October-December 2010 and consisted of his Mindcrack 1-61. The episodes were daily and Guude never missed a day. It ended when SMP became actually survival

**Guude**

The boss. He started Mindcrack and built it up to where it is today. Yes, you are watching Guude Boulderfist. He was unable to find a Golden Record in a Dungeon until Episode 290 and it was stolen five episodes later. Lives in a remote North Carolina region with his wife and daughter, and has so many stories he could give the Most Interesting Man in the world a run for his money. Used to run his own coding business and still thinks of LPing as hobby. Yes, he knows he's near Episode 400. Has a secondary account called Easycgi that's been around since Season 1 but most prominently featured in Episode 200 and the Arena fixing. He dropped a bunch of gravel on a guy's house once and vined somebody else. Member of Nancy Drew, OOG, OOGE, and Ca$h Money. He *really* likes turtles. And his laugh is infectious.

###Season 2

This ran from Alpha 1.2.5 to Beta 1.7.3 (December 2010 to September 2011) and was the first Mindcrack season to have SMP. Original players were Guude's friends from World of Warcraft, but added more players through contest. Ended with 1.8.

**Thejims**

The man, the mystery, thejims. We don't know too much about him, but he's a good builder/technician and was the only person on the server not to make a LP until FTB started this year. He's a friend of Guude's from Warcraft and his skin is Alucard. Joined in December 2010.

**Jsano**

Joining New Year's 2011 Jsano was invited on the server because he was terrible at Minecraft. He is a firefighter and a nurse and lives in the D.C. area but is a native Michigander. He started the prank wars by hiding Guude's food, and Guude got angry and dropped gravel on Jsano's home. He then blew up his house anyway. He likes exploring and finding Villages and has an automated brewing station. Also he has firefighter gear on his skin.

**Nebris**

Joining right after Jsano, Nebris was one of two people to get every question in the first Contest: finding signs hidden in Season 1 and answering questions on them. Guude's pretty sure he used a cheaty texture pack. Nebris builds really big things and has a massive amount of gear and riches. Didn't start an LP until Season 3, but has become known through the Death Games and FTB. He's a Cobblehater, and runs a dictator ship on FTB. North Nebris is best Nebris.

**Adlington**

He missed only one question on the first contest in a last-second submission and was added in February 2011. He was the third LPer on the server. He builds really big unfinished castles modeled after Harry Potter. Adlington has a Minion skin and used to live in the UK but has moved to Ottawa. He killed BdoubleO that one time and poured sand on his village. 

**Mhykol**

Yes we know who he is! Mhykol is a member of the server that joined in April 2011 for a one-off and joined fully in September that year. He likes building things and is a member of the Spawn. He is getting married soon. Mhykol also runs a really awesome server I play on /shameless plug. He currently has FTB server so you can expect frequent FTB videos from him.

**Vintage Beef**

First place in Contest 2 (make a video), he joined the server after being a long time fan. He had ~100 subs then in May 2011 and ~30,000 a year later. He'll have 450,000 this coming May. Beef is a builder and has built a mansion, a castle, and a jungle village. He has an eye for detail and getting frustrated at Villagers. His first death on Mindcrack was to fall damage hence 'done a Beef'. Now apparently he has no legs, his face got melted, and brown sheep are stalking him. Member of Nancy Drew and Team Canada. Has the definitive Prank Wars series.

**Baj**

Baj was third in Contest 2 and joined. He is known for his dry British humor and occasional swear words. Baj is another builder and spends a lot of his time building things. His content is pretty underwatched. In UHC 3 and 6 he was 'Baj Grylls', a survivor man. In his Nancy Drew role he is the calm one while the other three 'jabber on'. He waited for wheat to grow an entire UHC episode, and now can't escape that. Has a face and a pixel art of the Queen in the ocean. *He made that for her Diamond Jubilee*.

**Shree**

The youngest member of the server coming in at 15, Shree was 5th in Contest 2. He was chosen personally to join by Guude. Yes, we know his voice has gotten deeper since he joined the server in May 2011. Happened to us all, so stfu. Has an underwater house and does a mix of redstone and building. Currently on a hiatus from Mindcrack as he has exams.

###Season 3

The current Mindcrack season has been from September 2011 onwards to the present. Mindcrack has grown astronomically during this season, and now the map is massive. It is what most of us think of when we say Mindcrack.

***BdoubleO***

Joined when Season 3 began after beginning the Legendary bromance with Guude in OOG. Guude's constant foil for a long time, the pupil has 'eclipsed' the master. He built an Arena in about a year and has seen himself get killed by Adlington, moving a desert a few blocks, seeing the Arena burn, and having huge 'E's placed above his build. His original still ongoing series is Building with BdoubleO where he does what he does best: build. Created the B-Team with Generik and does lots and lots of videos with him. It started as mafia hit squad against Etho culminating in the trial. And don't get me started on FTB. Bdubs is a key Mindcrack member. *Snaps fingers*.

**Pakratt**

Pakratt got second in Contest 3, which was to finish the Season 2 Arena. He is a technological genius, and is behind Sherryl the TNT cannon at Guudeland. He is famous for creating Guudeland and the games in it, as well as his epic rants. See 'Minecraft version 1.never' on his channel for more. He is currently hanging out in FTB, and started the push not to kill the Dragon there. Pakratt is a Cobblehater and a floating head.

**Arkas**

Third in contest 3, Arkas is an enigmatic builder from the Netherlands. He is famous for building big things. *Really frickin big things*. Like a Mothership in the middle of the ocean for starters.

**Avidya**

Avidya was whitelisted when Season 3 began, but it wasn't until October 2012 when he truly joined. He is famous for his voice, but has been described by various people as amazing. Avidya is an old friend of Guude from when Guude succeeded him running the forums' LP directory. He, Guude, and Vechs created Race for Wool and were part of the first RFW match. Avidya is 'the Dude', and drinks white Russians. He likes sandstone. Part of team Ca$h Money.

**Pause**

Pause is a Canadian Indian on the server. He is engaged to his girlfriend Andrea and lives in British Columbia. Pause shaved his head for Zeldathon charity. He joined in November 2011, and had for a long time the longest railway. Pause is a beast with the bow (it's his Indian heritage), and is mister bigshot with 11,000 subscribers. He is traditionally partnered with Beef and is part of Team Canada.

**MCGamer**

MC is the Nintendo LPer on the server. He has made *six* different LP series on the server. MC has built the Underwater Palace, Cinnabar Island (destroyed), and the Mountain Home. For a long time he had the famous daily Good Morning Mindcrack series. With his friend and now housemate Mike he started Zeldathon, a charity livestream. He is part of the Fun For Freedom community he created. Very emotional with Zelda and Mother 3. Has an unhealthy lapis addiction. Skin is Giovanni and has a podcast with other housemate Alex, the Temporary Podcast. MC is 'Matthew Cutter Game'. Cutter was a friend.

**Etho**

Etho joined with MC in December 2011 and has brought his famous dry humor and trickery to the server. Besides starting off by pranking Guude, he was done many mischievous things. Started the Death Games by engaging open war against MC and Nebris. He also drew the B-Team against him and killed them repeatedly, leading to a Trial. Recently built Beef an underwater village. Nobody know what he looks like, and he's keeping it that. Great at UHC and PVP but his kryptonite has been Pause. Also has a friend named General Spaz. A member of Team Canada.

**Docm**

The German redstoner, Doc joined Mindcrack in December 2011. He decided to create a jungle and has been at it ever since. Doc is known for his technological genius especially in his classic World Tour serious. Doc is likely the most down-to-earth Mindcrackers and gives great talks about various topics. Is a former basketball player and a great guy.

**Kurt**

The Far Lander. Is defined by his Far Lands or Bust series far more than Mindcrack, which is notoriously infrequent. Has been walking west to the Far Lands for two years, a lot of that time with his faithful dog Wolfie. His skin is the 10th Doctor in 3D glasses. Far Lands or Bust is a fundraiser for Child's Play Charity, and over $100,000 has been raised. To get this out of the way: He's never died in FLOB, he'll hit F3 at the end of a 100% charity stream, he's in 1.7.3 because the Far Lands have been removed. And the red stuff is clay. Also an avid astronomer and Team Single Malt Scotch member. Indeed.

**Zisteau**

Famous for LPs of Kaizo Caverns, Legendary, and Inferno Mines, Zisteau is a brilliant Mindcracker. His pranks are legendary, massive, and planned far in advance. He has a lava obsession, and a problem staying away from pranking. In addition to build a floating Lens, Zisteau has spent months building a village just to blow it up. He's that kind of guy, and very OCD too. In FTB he has a secret base hidden where nobody knows how to reach it. If you try to seek it, get your man pants.

**Anderz**

The swearing Swedish viking. Has quite the dedicated fanbase, and plays lots of Battlefield 3 and FTB. Is quite the 'spastic' Mindcracker, and is very much NSFW. But he has fun no matter what he plays, and puts out the most frequent FTB contest. Doing videos is just pure fun for Anderz. That and he finds gold and diamonds pretty easily to others' annoyance.

**Pyrao**

A Northern Irish university student, Pyrao was recommend to join by Bdubs. A former major Call of Duty player, he is now focusing on exams and Minecraft. At the time he joined Mindcrack, he had the most subs of anybody. Talks about everything from college to very in-depth existential thoughts in his video. His skin is him in a lizard suit because why not?

**Millbee**

A Welsh gamer, Millbee joined in June 2012. He 'broke-up' Pause and Beef's relationship, and does lots of co-ops with Pause. He once shot himself. Has a strange fascination with Matt Damon and does quite hilarious vlogs and streams. His jokes a pitch-perfectly timed, and gets better with drinking. Starves to death every once in a while to his annoyance.

**GenerikB**

The hermit, Generik joined in August 2012. He became part of the B-Team mafia, terrorizing Etho. His fued/bromance with BdoubleO has taken off with them doing co-ops at every change. Has a unique fun video style and is quite the redstoner. He really likes 'stal' and has a Porklift of saddled pigs. Is currently in Mine Wars on vanilla, Emerald Wars on FTB, and was just racing to commander in BLOPS2, all with BdoubleO.

**BTC**

Joining in October 2012, Blame the Controller is a map-maker, famous for Kingdom of the Sky. His entrance to the server was a very well planned scavenger hunt for Halloween. BTC has quite the life, and joined the army and served in Iraq. BTC is a down-to-earth guy but also quite the badass. He has his own public server and is still looking for a special someone. Not-so-secret Saturday.

**PaulSoaresJr**

A long-time big Minecraft LPer, Paul finally joined in the end of 2012. He is famous for survival series where he survives in Minecraft. He has quite the family and plays with them in Punchwood Island, and just his wife in Man, Woman, Minecraft. The oldest server member, Paul is starting a base called Lonely Mountain. He's also sure chickens are out to get him, and likes putting his adventures on the subreddit.
 
###Retired Mindcrackers

**Madcow**: Second ever Mindcracker, Guude's longtime friend from high school. Built Season 2 spawn. ""Oh, he's on fire!""

**Alc**: Third Mindcracker, a member of Boulderfist with Guude. Played very briefly in Season 2. Started a more recent LP with YT name alcboulderfist

**Epsie23**: The other guy that 100%ed Contest 1 with Nebris. Removed due to inactivity, liked to show off ore blocks. Did a five-episode SSP LP.

**Crysix**: Another of Guude's WOW friends, barely seen except for a caving video group with him. Cool name.

**Kuroro**: Kurururururu was removed due to inactivity and generally being annoying and 'improving' Guude's builds without permission. ""He was born without the ability to form ideas."" Still watches Guude and Beef to this day.

**Kennydyzak**: 1/2 of 2creditstoplay, went inactive in a hurry after getting 2nd in Contest 2. All co-op videos were his perspective.

**Stennent**: Guude's first Minecraft subscriber. Was rarely on the server, and only seen in person in Episode 200 aka The Giant Fucking Wheat Farm

**Davmandave**: 2/2 of 2creditstoplay, made it into Season 3 but joined the army after making a spawn vine cube. It was torn down by Kurt.

**JustD3fy**: The 1st place winner of Contest 3 he was a long time follower of Vintage Beef, designing his first skin and channel background. Removed when he lost inspiration.

Hello ladies and genlemen! Allow me to welcome you to ULTRA HARDCORE SEASON 9.

Things are a bit different, as this season is a **throwback season**, a 5 teams of 4 race to the end of the game to defeat the ender dragon. I'll let the indiviudal mindcrackers explain the rules in a more detailed fashion.

I hope you all enjoyed my little hypefest today. We'll do something similar, except better planned, soon, I promise.

Without further ado, here are your teams!

&gt;
&gt;Wait, no....

Just got word from the server that the map has officially been reset and that **Season 4 has begun.**

Just wanted to take a minute to talk about our policies on new videos as they start going up later tonight, lasting through the hype period of the new map.

Videos will be released on an individual basis with no group schedule starting today, and we will not be restricting these to a group event (though there is a ""Season 4"" link flair if you'd like to use that). However, I will be trying to keep a list of everyone's first videos here as they go up, and this thread can be used for general Season 4 Discussion. (Or various ways to say HYPE, that too)

Mindcrackers are planning to try and organize, so certain posts may be good to have a group event attached to them, and you should feel free to make these into such.

Hype party!

...But remember that videos have to be edited and then released! So like, take a nap or something, cause it's going to be a couple of hours at the very least.

Because of that, I've been living in a hotel the last few weeks while I put in my two weeks at my current gig.  This hotel has terrible internet, so I haven't been able to play anything online, let alone upload anything.  Also, my good computer was already sent home.

Tomorrow I'll be packing up the rest of my things and moving home.  I'll be stopping at State College for the weekend, though.

Welcome To UHC XI
======

Hello ladies and gents, Aubron here, and welcome to a very special season of Mindcrack: Ultra Hardcore. This season we're changing it up, and that means excitement, indecision, paranoia, and a really good time for our viewers.

A quick intro to newbies: Ultra Hardcore is a minecraft gamemode in which a number of Minecraftians are dropped into a limited size map, and battle it out to be reduced to one ultimate victor. Health does not regenerate normally, but only via golden apples (which have been made more difficult, require gold ingots) and health potions, which now require a gold block.

First of all, this season is a FFA (Free for All), which means every man for himself against the other players and his environment.

Secondly, Episode times have been reduced to 20 minutes, to allow viewers to see their favorite LPers perspectives separately without breaking the time bank. I assure you there's still plenty of action per episode, however.

Third, and possibly most excitingly, UHC XI will be played in full daylight. That's right, no nighttime. What does that mean? Very dangerous caves with increased mob numbers, and a very dangerous surface with players who aren't afraid of getting trapped outside.

And last but not least, we welcome a very special guest to the fold this season, Mojang employee Dinnerbone! Not a member I'm afraid, this guy has too much on his plate for that, but we're all excited to have him with us.

As always, I hope you enjoyed my hypefest today, and now I must return to my cage, where I will remain until it's time to write up EPISODE 2. Let the games begin!

-Aubron

Etho needs to kill Bdubs who needs to kill Doc who needs to kill DinnerBone ;) who needs to kill Etho

If Bdubs kills doc then Bdubs new target becomes dinnerbone and so on and so forth until 1 persons left.

The only twist is the people playing only know who they have to kill they don't know who has to kill them...only the person in charge of the game knows the order of the wheel!

Episodes will be released at 6pm, this is for discussion until then!*

Hello and again ladies and gentlemen, to Ultra Hardcore! Our season is 12, and our special guest stars are JL2579 (AKA JL Zip code), and the Illustrious SethBling! This season we're looking at teams of two, in a fierce deathmatch for supremacy. Additional rules for this season include no regen potions, and only the use of natural caves (no digging for caves). So without further ado, I give you your teams!

(Sorry about the limited hype this time, by the way, in my defense I didn't have much time to prepare. Next time I promise to hype you for nothing, just so this isn't so reliably UHC)

In your latest mindcrack, you asked for suggestions on what theme to base your builds around... I personally wouldn't mind seeing a Victorian style build. The reasons I believe this is a good theme, are simple: 

1. It was the end of the industrial revolution. Therefore red-stone machines and gadgets would be a perfect fit.
2. Horses where still the way to go. 
3. Railways were beginning to pop up around Britain. Giving the furnace minecart a reason to be used for aesthetics, as well as for a purpose.
4. arches and spires, mixed with masonry and industrial robustness, which may suit your build style. 

How ever this is just a suggestion. Congrats on the 1 million, and keep on keeping on.

Some of the MCFS people are very mad right now. But even though I feel pretty damn depressed (and a little drunk) I'm thankful to MindCrack for bringing us together.

I hope each and every one of you have a fantastic day. I'm gonna drink some beer, cause dammit, it's Father's day, and I do what I want.
Leave a comment below on your opinions.
Peace Off. We will meet again.

Hello Mindcrackers,

I care for a 11 y.o. boy who’s a huge Minecraft fan.  Unfortunately, he has a degenerative disease (rare form of MS), his limbs are too weak, and he cannot really play the game anymore.  So now he gets his « Minecraft fix » from your videos!  ;)

I know that, although you obviously enjoy the game, most of you do this for a living, it’s your job.  

But I thought you might like to know that your videos actually do make a big difference in this kid’s life.  He loves you all soooo much...  You should see how involved he gets in UHC, watching all perspectives, rooting for his « favourites », Kurt of course, as well as Beef, Etho and Pause.  

So to all Mindcrackers, keep up the good work, and thank you !

Mmii78 (big kid) and Theo (kid)

Here is where you come in: I need your help finding the best clips to put in here. Do you have a favorite moment from one of my videos? A montage you really liked? An interaction with another youtuber? Post it here.


To make this as streamlined as possible, try to use this format if you can:

Kaizo Caverns, Episode 42, 5:08, ""I meant to drink the mushroom soup!""

I've been living a lie for the past two years, and it's time for me to come clean.

Two years ago, I started my own minecraft LP under the name Etho and the Youtube channel ethoslab. While I was recording this footage live, I was not comfortable enough with my voice at the time to provide narration. Thankfully, I found a wonderful voice actor who was more than willing to help out, voicing over my video with scripts that I sent him, and he is the voice of the ""Etho"" that you all know and love.

I was, in short, amazed by the response. While I later was able to gain confidence in my voice, and record videos under my own name, ethoslab was too big, I couldn't pull back the curtain and reveal the lie. I had to hide my identity so that people wouldn't put 2 and 2 together. That all changed today however.

Earlier today I was informed that Julian Spaz (pictured [here](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/A8azOsgCIAAPsSz.jpg)), my voice actor, was killed tragically and suddenly in a freak steamroller accident. This is a major blow to myself, and all the mindcrack community. We will always remember him fondly, even if he couldn't correctly pronounce simple words like ""Lava"" or ""pollen"". Seriously, what kind of paid voice actor can't pronounce simple words? But I digress...

By necessity, you should expect all videos past today to use my actual voice and demeanor. I understand that this is a violation of my subscribers trust, and if you use coupon code AubronEtho2013 in your youtube whitelist PMs to me, you will be guaranteed to be whitelisted to Mindcrack, even if no other word in your application is spelled correctly or put together in any meaningful way.

I hope we can still be friends.

The input accepts regular youtube links that contain v=wLCFsXMOBy0, and also time offsets like t=205s, then generates a link.

Example link, for team PEP:
http://drunkenastronaut.com/uhc.html?v=qj8s89PE180&amp;t=191s&amp;v=wLCFsXMOBy0&amp;t=974s&amp;v=iiLqi4Op0hs&amp;t=114s

Contains the following parameters:  
v: Youtube video id  
t: Optional, offset for syncing purposes. Since this is the first set of videos I chose the starting marker.  
      
* Etho  
v=qj8s89PE180  
t=191s  
  
  
* Pakratt:  
v=wLCFsXMOBy0  
t=974s  

* PSJR  
v=iiLqi4Op0hs  
t=114s  
  
Which all cobbled together is v=qj8s89PE180&amp;t=191s&amp;v=wLCFsXMOBy0&amp;t=974s&amp;v=iiLqi4Op0hs&amp;t=114s
  
I don't know if anyone minds, since it embeds the videos supplied as a parameter. I tried to fetch channel info for every video that's loaded and link to it though.

Didn't even think to check if a tool already existed. But anyhow, might be useful to someone :P

Edit:  
Oh and before I forget, it's all just in the source. So if you have any improvements or anything, just copy that and go to town. It's something I threw together in my spare time, so if anyone wants to do it better, or add stuff, go nuts!

""I keep putting more and more effort into my videos and people are making me feel like I'm getting lazy. I used to do almost nothing per episode in my older videos and never had anyone complain. So it's frustrating... but I'll keep trying to improve.""

Well, this is unacceptable. 

I really don't understand people who claim that Etho doesn't give any content in his videos. I'm French, and i (try to) improve my english in watching Etho's videos since last september. I think i've got more affinity with his SSLP, and the both two seasons are incredibly awesome.
I mean, if Minecraft was a science, Etho would won tons of Nobel prize.
Etho is pedagogue, all his explanations are mostly clear. 
He invents so many things/logicsredstonethings/games !
The tamagotchi, the EATS road, BUD, hooperclockthing,... And even if he doesn't make a lot of montage, his transitions are so original and funny.
This is undeniable that he put lot of work/time/(love?) in his episodes, and for me, all this things and the billion others i forgot, Etho is the BEST minecraft youtuber ever. 
Even his first alpha ""home"" he shown in his firsts videos is way better than many actual minecrafter.

So, if there is any chance of being read by you Etho, know that it's a real pleasure each time you post a video (especially your SSLP), because you are amazing, you speak really clearly so i can understand 99% of what you are saying and improve my english.
Thank you very much for all Etho, YOU ARE THE BEST.

Sorry for the word-wall and if there is mistakes, as i said sooner, my english is in work-in-progress.

P.S: if you really think that Etho doesn't give good content, i invite you to search some French minecraft Youtuber, all they do is just to take something's working in north america, and copy it in french.
Yes, really.

Thank's all for reading ~~me~~ this, 
Cordially,
OVS

**EDIT#1**: ""Etho, the best part about you is that you're still the same relaxed, boat-loving, redstone-obsessed guy I remember from video 1, just a little less shy. I've never even met you, but you feel less like a YouTube celebrity and more like an old friend.
Never stop being you, man."" 

Yes, this is a good abstract of what i'm thinking.   (Comment by creeping)

**EDIT#2**: Wow, thank you everyone for giving some support to my post. Glad to see i'm not the only one :D Gloria to Ethopians :D **We love you Etho**

The convention has a lot of events and it is all about having a good time. I understand that some people are not capable of just relaxing and having a good time but to come to this video and just belittle the appearance of others and act like they are above it all just makes me sick. It is times like these I really question the people I am trying to entertain and it makes me sad.

I know people are going to say don't read the comments or ignore the haters or don't feed the trolls or whatever other one liner is commonly used to brush away this kind of abuse, but at the end of the day it just isn't right.\

So, coming up one June 12th is Kurt's 31st birthday! Now as we all know he's running the Far Lands or Bust Child's Play Charity fundraiser. This season, Season 4, he is attempting to raise $100,000 dollars for Child's Play Charity.

Currently over at [Far Lands or Bust's website](www.farlandsorbust.com), Kurt is at 28% of that goal, with $28,000 dollars. So why not, for his 31st birthday, we get Kurt to 31%! That would be $3,000 dollars in 24 days, which is certainly something doable. The last campaign raised about $4,000 dollars for his 30th birthday, so I think this is certainly doable. And if you can't donate, you can always spread the word too. So let's make this a great birthday for Kurt!

**EDIT**: We are about $1,500 from reaching the Season 3 goal of $29,220.2! If we reach it by the end of today, stinusmeret (a well know Far Lander) will donate $25 to the cause. Break $30,000 and he'll donate $50!

Quite a while back I stumbled upon the first OOG series and enjoyed the Bdubs and Guude interaction immensely.  This led me to various other Mindcrackers and their channels.  At first it was great, a little relaxing video after dinner.  Then I found myself sneaking in one while eating breakfast.  Then two.  After a little while I started being late for work because of Mindcrack videos.  I managed to solve this problem by watching them (instead of the assembly line I was supposed to monitor.)  Of course the inevitable happened and while I was watching Baj watch wheat grow in UHC one of the robots went crazy and maimed one of the guys on the line.  The loss of my job freed up time for more Mindcrack videos.  Months went by and I realized my wife had left me.  I think her last words were something about me loving Anderzel more than her, I dunno hard to hear her over Anders screaming about a green penis.   Then my dog died, I guess I neglected to feed her.

I've noticed for a while, but it really became apparent yesterday. BTC is getting a free pass to tell someone to shut the fuck up. Why? Because he makes funny videos? Because he's stressed? I'm sorry, but it's not right. It's unprofessional and horribly disrespectful.

I mean, I'd get it if the guy was saying ""mindcrack sucks dick"" or insulting one of the mindcrackers. But no, he was stating his opinion.

On the same note, I've noticed how comment scores shift when a mindcracker appears.

Example:

Guy makes valid point/statement, gets 100 upvotes.

Mindcracker comes in hour later, disagrees with him. He gets 150 upvotes and the other guy gets brought down to -5 within minutes of the Mindcracker posting.

Even my post saying exactly what I didn't like about the season so far has 20 downvotes. I couldn't care less about internet points, but this is too far. Some of you guys are trying to shut down any and all dissent. Some of you are bowing down to every mindcracker that shows up whenever he does.

I'm sorry for my little rant, but it's getting insane how cultish this subreddit is becoming.

EDIT: Link to BTC incident. http://np.reddit.com/r/mindcrack/comments/1j6log/uhc_s12_e07/cbbmfmr?context=3

EDIT2: Downvoting my comments only proves my point, guys. I'm explaining to you WHY I think this subreddit is turning rotten, and I'm getting downvoted.

EDIT3: To the people going to my comments out of this thread and downvoting them -- please stop. It's immature, and pointless.

EDIT4: Please, people, stop downvoting BTC's comment.

1376410879.0,385,self.mindcrack,1kaadm,Millbee: you're screwing this up,GlassHalfAwesome,787,402,481,http://www.reddit.com/r/mindcrack/comments/1kaadm/millbee_youre_screwing_this_up/,"He made a mistake. He posted a video with uncensored nudity. It doesn't matter that it was animated nudity, it was posted.

Youtube did what they do and banned his account. What happens next will be very important and Millbee is already screwing it up.

He did the right thing by contacting his partners, raising awareness on twitter, telling his fans not to harass and spam on Youtube, being patient, etc. He also received offers of help from the entire Mindcrack community as well as Totalbiscuit. That's all great.

Let's look at it from a business perspective. YouTube has a partner with a growing viewer count that posts quality content reliably. That's someone you want on your team. Unfortunately, that partner made a mistake and violated a very important rule. Terminating the account was the correct course of action based on what was posted. However, reinstating the account would be the correct business decision.

It was his first offense (according to him) and it wasn't a 20 minute long porn video. It was less than a seconds worth of accidentally uncensored nudity. This would easily be fixed by removing the offending video and unbanning the account.

That's the business smart decision to make.

Now Millbee is fucking that up.

In 1 day we went from professional Millbee to this:

* [Tells his fans to harass YouTube](http://i.imgur.com/ulZVjwK.png)

You may try to argue that this tweet isn't him trying to incite an e-riot. If you tell a group of people ""hey, be cool. don't harass people."" and then a day later say ""scratch that, do whatever you want"" then you're telling them to grab the pitchforks.

* [Has it even been two days yet?](http://i.imgur.com/0hl6ef6.png) 

I just checked. It's only been 40 hours. Not even two business days. Do you not understand how big of a company Youtube is? Realistically it would take at least a couple days to get this straightened out.

* [Seriously? Trying to guilt trip YouTube?](http://i.imgur.com/XKpt8Si.png)

You need to calm down. This isn't your parents deciding whether or not you get to go to the beach with your friends. This is you speaking with a company regarding your professional partnership with them.

Anyone who looks at this situation would immediately recognize that it's a smart business decision to unban your channel. At least, they would until they see who they'd be getting into business with.

* [If anybody thinks you're being childish?](http://i.imgur.com/omJywmy.png)

You are being childish. Would you act this way if you had to go sit in a boardroom with 4 YouTube employees and explain why you want the ban lifted? I would hope not

* [More of the same](http://i.imgur.com/OeC2mf7.png)

Who can you harass? Really? You have at least a dozen other YouTube partners on your side (including some pretty big ones.) Do you think any of them will be proud to have the back of someone this immature?

Last night I was 100% sure you would get your channel back. It's the smart business decision. Now you're fucking it up.

**edit:** [new tweet since I posted](http://i.imgur.com/yTlOIfy.png)

Your network hasn't even been on this for one business day. ~~Get the new channel setup and start uploading your videos. It's possible that you might not get your account back so you may as well be prepared for the worst.~~

**edit2:** apparently it's against the YouTube ToS to make a new account after you've been banned

**edit3:** I've been getting a lot of complaints about my comments regarding YouTube's removal process. I've heard countless times that every video, once it has received enough flags, is reviewed and the decision is made by a real person.

[This help page confirms it](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027?hl=en)

&gt; YouTube staff review flagged videos 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and videos that violate our Community Guidelines are removed from YouTube. Videos that may not be appropriate for all younger audiences are age-restricted.

&gt; Flagged videos are not automatically taken down by the flagging system. If a video doesn't violate our guidelines, no amount of flagging will change that, and the video will stay on the site.

When you report a video it asks for the exact time that the violation occurred. The people who review the videos don't need to watch every second of every reported video, they're directed to the problem.

Millbee's video was reviewed by an employee of YouTube and it was determined to be in violation of their Terms of Service. The account was terminated because of it.

The ""three strike law"" that people keep bringing up is for copyright infringement. There's no strike system for this type of violation

[Youtube's copyright infringement guidelines (which don't apply in this case)](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2814000?hl=en)

**edit4:** I love these responses to the post:

&gt; It's not hurting him, the people who make the decision won't even hear about this

&gt; All he's doing is raising awareness. If the mob backs off then nothing will get done.

So these immature actions aren't hurting him because YouTube is so big they'll just ignore it but at the same time he needs to resort to these actions otherwise YouTube will ignore him? Which is it, reddit?

**edit5:** A new message from Millbee:

&gt; Until they admit they are wrong and reverse this great abuse of their own system, admit that they have a flawed system and will change it. I see no reason to let up on the pressure and messages towards them. Let them never forget what we are feeling at this moment, and how disgusted we are that they feel it ok to treat their users with such little regard.

Millbee what are you doing. I couldn't cringe any harder if I tried. You're not leading an army into battle, you were banned for accidentally posting pornography. This is already being worked on by YouTube and Maker Studios. YOU ARE NOT HELPING WITH THIS SHIT.

You're acting like a child. Any business professional who reads this would not want to do business with you. Guess what, you're directing these messages at business professionals. 

There is no injustice here.

http://www.youtube.com/t/terms

&gt; YouTube reserves the right to decide whether Content violates these Terms of Service for reasons other than copyright infringement, such as, but not limited to, pornography, obscenity, or excessive length. YouTube may at any time, without prior notice and in its sole discretion, remove such Content and/or terminate a user's account for submitting such material in violation of these Terms of Service.

Work with them. Stop trying to grandstand

**edit7:** A couple of comments have brought up the 3 strike system with the Community Guidelines. 

[Link to the help page](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802032?hl=en)

Remember that this incident doesn't fall under the community guidelines. Millbee stated that he received an email for his First Strike but his account was closed anyway. Regardless of the strike against him, this still falls under the legally binding Terms of Service that were agreed to when the account was created.

1368885496.0,371,self.mindcrack,1ekr5x,B-Team Discussion,Guardax,650,279,658,http://www.reddit.com/r/mindcrack/comments/1ekr5x/bteam_discussion/,"Okay, so I'm just going to go on a little discussion about the B-Team and how it's changed really BdoubleO's content dynamic. When the B-Team started it was just a fake mafia hit squad thing with BOO and Generik trolling Etho. It built up a little storyline that lasted the perfect length and culminated in the Trial. And the Trial was awesome. But then there started to be B-Team videos everywhere. B-Team is by far the most prolific Mindcracker team up there is. Genny's FTB series is even Feed the *B-Team*. Now there have been a lot of changes.

First off, OOG was basically replaced by the B-Team. But the B-Team is bigger than OOG ever was. Thing was about OOG that made it hilarious was that it was 100% unscripted. All the moments were absolutely genuine and that's what made it funny. Now apparently it's impossible for Guude and BOO to be online together to record any OOG. Which is weird because Guude can record with Jsano, the vice president of the United States. 

Now back to the B-Team. Recently their videos have been very competition based. To sum it up:  Race for Commander, Mine Wars, Emerald Wars, 'B'lazing Saddles. Basically the B-Team is in an eternal competition. Emerald Wars ended and there were feelings that it might have been rigged. I'm not saying it was, but *there should have never been those feelings*. If Generik was going to kick BOO's butt in the competition, then so be it. The B-Team's answer is that they're entertainers. That's true, but I want unscripted entertainment. The B-Team hunt for Slimey Sammy video was funniest at the end. Why? Because it was unscripted and you could very much tell. If you watch the Cowboy Olympics video, the beginning was painfully scripted. But here's the thing too: I like the B-Team. Generik and BdoubleO are some of the best LPers out there. (And don't get the idea that I'm blaming Generik or anything, I'm not, he's a *great* server addition). Basically when I watch BdoubleO I want BdoubleO talking to me. Not a character, I want his commentary. That's why I watch Building with BdoubleO, it's pure unfiltered BOO. I don't want to be blaming Bdubs, it's just that the best moments of his (and the B-Team's for that matter) are the *unscripted* ones. Name a good B-Team moment, and it's something that they didn't plan for. If they make it more unscripted, it'll get funnier. Like the Adlington incident. That was hilarious because BOO was genuinely freaked at Adlington coming for them. Any BOO moment in DOOKE or UHC is a quip he makes off the cuff. 'B'lazing Saddles could work if there's just a theme of the LP. Maybe for example: the sherrif wants them to go get emeralds. Okay. Don't spent 15 minutes on the set-up, you can have the storyline running, but then the actual caving is unscripted. So you can have a B-Team blown up by a Creeper incident. *Those* are the moments that keep me coming back to the B-Team. The best 'B'lazing Saddles videos were the two solo ones the two did, because they were LPing with a little overarching 'story arc'. That's cool. BOO building buildings, Generik doing redstone. It's good stuff. Basically,  it would be nice if every video by them wasn't a B-Team competition, and if 'B'lazing Saddles was handled just a little differently. Then, I'm telling you, the videos could be great. 

**TL;DR**: I don't want characters, I want the real personalities. 

**EDIT**: And don't downvote people with different opinions. That's not cool

**EDIT 2**: Hey mods, I understand why this was removed. There have been too many assholes in this thread. I tried to encourage constructive criticism and maybe some praise too. I never wanted it to get as crazy as it did. I'm kind of glad it's back up, but everybody just please, *please* have a level head. This isn't a forum to insult the B-Team unconditionally, or me for that matter.  *Please, PLEASE* try and have a nice discussion.",,False,self,t5_2to85,1368897354.0,,specialmoderator,True,t3_1ekr5x,http://www.reddit.com/r/mindcrack/comments/1ekr5x/bteam_discussion/,

Sorry for the absence. You *could* blame it on the fact that, as a non-human, I am prone to inconvenient failures when certain fringe test scenarios arise. **OR** you could blame it on the fact that when that inconvenient error arose, the person who is supposed to fix me was out, oh I don't know, *slamming cars together*, not to point fingers. ~~Inconsiderate jerk~~ Poor thing.

Annnnnd we're back. I would say something clever, but I haven't watched this season. Working on some new features for Mod Bot that I think you all will like though. Planning to push them out before next episode. See you soon!

Hello ladies and gentlemen.

Today I'm releasing this at our new time of 5:45, so that folks can have a pre-game discussion prior to release.

Tuesday we met our teams and lost a ton of health, but today should really help us understand who is pulling ahead and who is being left by the wayside, as thoughts of iron turn to thoughts of diamond, and attention must, by necessity, move from survival to stage one of the challenge: Blaze Rods and ender pearls. Will we see our first death today? Will someone think to seize and fortify the portal early? Find out today on    
**Mindcrack Ultra Hardcore: Episode 2**!

1374560000.0,353,self.mindcrack,1ivaor,In regards to Etho's bug problem...,EndoplasmicPanda,408,55,79,http://www.reddit.com/r/mindcrack/comments/1ivaor/in_regards_to_ethos_bug_problem/,"In case you are unaware, Etho uploaded a [Cubeworld video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgwQsuzbeYM) today in which he told of how he was mercilessly getting bitten by a bug that gives him massive welts all over.

Everyone in the Youtube comments seems to be sure that it's a spider... some are even saying it's a Brown Recluse Spider. I can safely say that whatever it is that's biting Etho is definitely NOT a Brown Recluse Spider, because BRS's have a necrosis effect that *has a chance of leaving* the victim with massive cysts and injuries that, if left unchecked, might lead to serious tissue damage. ([A photo of a Brown Recluse Bite. NSFW](http://imgur.com/vQhczoF.jpg)) Etho mentioned that the welts do in fact go away, ruling out this as the biter.

Another hypothesis is that it's bed bugs. This is not the case, as bed bugs typically do not leave welts that size, nor do they only bite once, as there are almost always more than one. 

No. I personally believe that Etho is getting bit by a [Kissing Bug.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triatominae) These insects often have their bites mistaken as spider bites, and are called Kissing Bugs because of their attraction to carbon dioxide, leading them to bite a victim near the mouth (as Etho mentioned happened recently). They also typically travel solo (explaining how Etho only gets bit every few days or so).

Kissing Bugs bites aren't dangerous *per se*, but left unchecked can lead to pain and potential infection, not to mention the chance of this Kissing Bug laying eggs, turning one bite every now and then to much, much more.

I definitely think Etho should keep looking around his bedroom for an insect the size of a penny or smaller (it will be visible to the naked eye and have reddish-brown wings). Continuing to change your sheets and looking under your mattress pads/bed could are both great ideas.

Source: I'm an insomniac that hates bugs and I've spent many a sleepless night looking up what bad things try to snuggle up with me

**TL;DR: Etho, if you see something that looks like [this,](http://imgur.com/eGq2ZDf.jpg) kill it. Kill it with the fury of a thousand suns.**

**EDIT:** Changed some Brown Recluse information per /u/Sadsharks' clarification(s).

**EDIT 2:** As many in the comments have said, it's also a good idea for Etho to get professional assistance with this, as online medical help (*coughcough WebMD coughcough*) can be quite incorrect sometimes. Nonetheless, it's still a good idea to keep an informed eye out for anything that may look like the creature in picture above.",,False,self,t5_2to85,1374580336.0,,dinnerbone,True,t3_1ivaor,http://www.reddit.com/r/mindcrack/comments/1ivaor/in_regards_to_ethos_bug_problem/,

Not quite sure if this is the right spot for this but I knew I could reach all of you and not be drowned out by questions to join the server and what not. 

I'm a 26yr old with Cystic Fibrosis, so I spend a lot of time in hospitals. Children hospitals to be more precise, because that's the age for most living with CF. I would just like to thank each one of you from the bottom of my heart for all the work and time you guys put into your videos and time for charity. You might not see it first hand but I talk with a lot of kids while I'm in the hospital and you guys help pass the long, hard, painful, and lonely days for myself and lots of kids. I also get a chance to witness kids play games thanks to your selfless acts for charity. I've heard many of you mention that you guys are humbled when you hear such things, but there are more going on than you will ever know. You should feel proud IMO, what you do might seem small but it helps kids push further through their day. Thanks again for all you guys do. 

Sorry again if in wrong spot to post, also for wall of text.

1350619202.0,314,self.mindcrack,11qbj3,Mindcrack: 2 Year Anniversary,Guardax,349,35,112,http://www.reddit.com/r/mindcrack/comments/11qbj3/mindcrack_2_year_anniversary/,"2 years ago today a man named Jason in South Carolina decided to upload his first Minecraft video. He called it 'Mindcrack' because it was 'so fucking addictive'. He thought it would be buried in millions of series' but would do it for fun. Jason began to began to create a loyal following of a few people, putting out tons of Mindcrack episodes. On December 7th, he ended Mindcrack Season 1 on Episode 61.

He decided to start a server with his friends: madcow, Crysix, Alc, and theJims. With him and them they became the 'First Five' members. Only theJims and Jason are still around today. He added another Let's Player, Jsano because he was terrible at Minecraft. A contest was held, adding Nebris, Epsie, Adlington, and Kuroro. Stennant, his first subscriber, was also allowed on.

In April Mhykol was invited but stayed inactive for the rest of Season 2. A second contest was held. Vintage Beef, 2creditstoplay, Baj, and Shree got on the server. 1.8 dawned on the horizon and a third season was started. A final contest let Pakratt, JustD3fy, and Arkas on the server. BdoubleO is invited. Then the LPer invites began. Pause, MCGamer, Etho, Doc, Kurt, Zisteau, Anderz, Pyrao, Millbee, and GenerikB are now on. Avidya returns.

However in the process, madcow, Alc, Crysix, epsie, stennant, kuroro, 2creditstoplay, and justd3fy have left.

So that was my hopefully eloquent opening. (Anyone notice Jsano and Jason are anagrams of each other? Guude and Jsano really are one person). Mindcrack at 2 Years! Who would have noticed? Well I'm glad that I did as this really is a momentous occasion to be celebrating. 

To start: let's thank Jason aka Guude. Guude has been responsible for this whole thing, and started the server (no, not Etho). In the time he's been making a total of 354 Mindcrack episodes over two years. That's almost a video every other day! That's insane. He's kept us entertained, and has a new baby daughter and now makes a living just off YouTube. It has changed his life, but not just his.

Everyone on the server that currently lives off Mindcrack could not have done so without Guude. To my knowledge these are: Etho, Pause, Kurt, BdoubleO, MC, Doc, and Beef. There may be more. They could never have gotten their dream job if Guude didn't introduce them to this community.

However, it's a misconception that Mindcrack is only for the 'famous'. First of all I don't consider the Mindcrackers famous nor do they. They do have around 100,000 fans each (of the members with the most subscribers). But they're just people. I've seen comments like: ""My hotbar's just like Kurt's, I feel connected with the divines' and things like that. They're great people just serving us, but they're not famous. At least not yet.

Mindcrack started just as a hobby for Guude. I doubt he ever thought it would reach this level. In fact, for the first year it still wasn't very popular. It's this second year that I started following and Mindcrack took off. Guude only had 10-15k subs last anniversary. Now he's at 130k. Why did he get over 100k subs in a year? It's because people finally discovered what great content he and every one else has. Mainly UHC 3 introduced everyone's individual Mindcrack sub bases. A misconception is Mindcrack is so big now that they don't pay attention to the fans.

I disagree. Take this subreddit. It has almost 11,000 subs. (Guess who's so fancy with his 11,000 subs, freaking high-rolling Pause). I see daily interaction by the Mindcrackers. They're not high-rolling, they pay attention and love their fans. That's what makes this community so special and different from any other. The amount of interaction with the Mindcrack fans.

I've heard stories of videos getting people through tough times in their life. I've heard a story of a person learning English through the videos. Me, one of my traditions since the series started has been to listen to Good Morning Mindcrack right after I wake up. It honestly gets me more alert and saves me from drudging through the day.

The point I'm making a bad job of getting at is this: This is a great community, and we're all thankful to Guude and the team for making all this great content.

And now I present the finale of my series to honor Guude and Mindcrack. You guys are awesome. This link links to a playlist of all the Countdown videos in reverse order. Watch through all of them, building up to Guude. We're not just honoring Guude, but all of Mindcrack.

Here we go: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znpD6UKDi3Q&amp;list=PL-E11gMQ-0cD2H-G7h3kY6ObsW5Ovi8GG

Enjoy.

Here's to two years and three seasons, and many more! *Clinks champagne*

-Guardax

----
Okay here's the part where I thank everyone for their support in my Mindcrack countdown series. Here's the list of people to thank: My 471 subscribers (holy shit) for subscribing for the series (maybe LPs can't promise), Crimson5M my first sub (you told me to remember you and I did), Adlington for subscribing to me, Doc for liking the video I made of him, Generik for liking, commenting on and favoriting the vid I did of him, Guude for liking Pause's vid, MC for commenting on his, Millbee for liking, commenting on, and favoriting his, Pause for liking and commenting on his, and Beef for liking and commenting on his.

*Phew*

So thank you guys for supporting me, the project was a lot of fun! I made this section as small as possible so as not to detract from the main point which is celebrating Guude and Mindcrack. So thank you all! 

Also new project start: On a publicly viewable but privately uneditable Google Doc I will be making a chart of all of Guude's Mindcrack videos 'the official Mindcrack register'. I will start this project very soon, and post when I watch all of Season 1

Allons-y! (Team Kurt for life, though I'm using the overall Mindcrack flair today)

1370536725.0,316,self.mindcrack,1fssfm,Response to yesterdays Mindcrack Movie and proposition to the Mindcrackers and the Community,BiscuitLicker,359,43,99,http://www.reddit.com/r/mindcrack/comments/1fssfm/response_to_yesterdays_mindcrack_movie_and/,"[Yesterday I posted this](http://www.reddit.com/r/mindcrack/comments/1fq738/the_mindcrack_movie_fan_trailer_i_took_the_voices/)

Let me start by saying thank you to everyone. This is truly an awesome community. I got so much support and nice comments from everyone, this is a great place, thank you.

Many of you and those on youtube expressed interest in actually making this a full movie, I'm totally up for this, but I need the support of the Mindcrackers in that of voice acting. There's no way we could write a script and then sift through thousands of videos to find sound bytes, we need the MIndcrackers to record lines if we really want to make this happen.

I figure if the finished product goes in the [MindcrackNetwork Channel](http://www.youtube.com/mindcracknetwork) and would then make the Mindcrack server money, it would not only be a great project for the community to work on and see, the Mindcrackers could feel as though they were not wasting their time, since the money would go to support the server they play on.

In the previous paragraph I talked about getting the community involved. I think this project would be so much more special if more of the community helped to make it! I've already have script writers on standby and other things that could be done by the community are editing the Mindcrack server map (removing weird blocks, finishing projects, building new structures, editing existing ones etc.) If you are interested in helping build the maps for the movie, send me an email at endersoup@gmail.com, subject line ""building"" If the Mindcrack guys wish to continue with this project I'll send all of you emails with further details, I won't spam this poor subreddit with anymore of my crap :D Anyone that helps will be put in the credits.

One more question before I finish, how would you feel about doing a series of 10-15 minute episodes rather than one movie? I'm fine for either but I'd like some input! I can see pros and cons to both of them.



If anyone has anymore questions you can contact me by email, reddit or youtube.

endersoup@gmail.com

youtube.com/endersoup


TL:DR: Mindcrackers! Would you voice act in a Mindcrack movie? Would you do it if it went on the MindcrackNetwork Channel and supported the server? Community! Want to help? Read above for details.


**EDIT: Guys please keep the suggestions etc. for the movie in an existing thread or post one at /r/mindcrackmovie I don't want to make anyone angry, thanks!!!**

So, I rendered out the map download. Went from ~3gb to over 13gb. I have horrible internet so I've been uploading since Monday night. (Also didn't help it's over 250,000 files).

Here is the link: http://mindcrackmap.chrissterling.me/

**Edit**

http://mindcrackmap.chrissterling.me/info/ (BW/Disk Space usage. Memory was completely wrong so I took it out)

If you are visiting and all of a sudden can't view the map, let me know via PM and I'll take a look. Just configured something to protect me and I'm hoping I didn't do it wrong.

And for the type of information I love. Last 12 hours (Taken at 11:59PM EST)

Starting with Season 2 of Far Lands or Bust, Kurt turned it into a walkathon marathon with a goal of raising $800 dollars for Child's Play Charity based off of the 800 hour number to walk to the Far Lands.

The Far Landers beat that in *less than a week*. So Kurt upped the ante to $8,000 dollars and in November 2011 hosted an 8 hour 20 minute lifestream where he would press F3. Donations later, it stretched to 12 hours 20 minutes, and we ended Season 2 at the 292202 Monument.

Season 3 began with a $29,220 donation goal, and the Far Landers reached that. Kurt then offered an ultimatum: double the total by the end of the livestream and he would attend Minecon Paris. And we stepped up to the plate, even reaching 240% of the goal, getting BdoubleO to Minecon Paris. And we ended the season at the 699492 Monument. 

Then Season 4 began saving Wolfie with the ambitious goal of $100,000 dollars and that is where we are today. But how much HAS Kurt raised?

Let's go over the totals from the ChipIns on his website.

**Season 2**: $11,739

**Season 3**: $70,879.85

**Season 4**: $14,589

And then factoring in the money that Canadians 4 Kidz raised for FLOB..

**Canadians 4 Kidz**: $5,161

We get that Kurt has raised...

***$102,008.85 for Child's Play Charity*** 

Kurt you have truly made a difference in countless kids' lives whose days have been brightened because of what you've done. I know you'll say it was all us who actually donated, but without you we never would have been exposed to the charity and been given the incentive too. Kurt who have truly done an incredible thing with Far Lands or Bust and I am sure that that money has gone to making a sick kid feel better. And Kurt, we never could have done it without you. I'm proud to be a Far Lander.",,False,self,t5_2to85,False,,specialmoderator,True,t3_19tkhp,http://www.reddit.com/r/mindcrack/comments/19tkhp/far_lands_or_bust_2_years_and_10200885_for_childs/,

Hello UHC fans! Today, the question is on everyone's mind, will we see our first PvP death? With multiple teams headed in towards the center of the map, the tension (and the chances of combat) escalate. Will Pause's fire arrows see blood? Will DOOKE finally move towards completing the challenge? Will everyone release their episodes on time? Find out today on Mindcrack: Ultra Hardcore.

This changes the dynamic as it encourages exploration right from the get-go, leaving those who stay behind to cave in the dust. But if you stay by yourself, you have no chance of being back-stabbed later on when you least expect it!

#MASSIVESOILERSAHHH


-
-


The first time that GenerikB is actually killed by a player is season 10, where Avidya (Ironically) gets first blood. Up until that point, Team Sobriety (Kurt, Avidya, Mhykol) had been doing pretty well. They had lost almost no health. It wasn't until AFTER GenerikB's head was in their posession that they began to take damage, and the Iron Kurtain had finally fallen to mortality. They happened to have a little bit of good luck with Nebris's team, granted, but that was only a failed attempt at murdering sobriety. The cursed head sent his former teammates (Pottymouths, Anderzel and Milbee) to avenge him by killing Sobrity. Unfortunately, it did not work, and MAN was wiped out. 

But what did the cursed head do? The head has mysterious ways of getting the job done, but boy, did it get done. The Head did something odd to change the course of the game. It paralleled Sobriety with a different team, Team GuudeBJ. From then on, Team Sobrity and Team Guude BJ would be stuck in a vortex, a time ripple, which would bond them to the same fate. They were together paralleled until death. And I can prove it.

For the sake of this analysis, let's say that each person on Sobriety was also paralleled to a person on GuudeBJ. In this case, Kurt is Paralleled to Guude (Both finalists in season 3). Mhykol is Paralleled to Baj(Both forgotten). And Avidya is paralleled to Jsano(Both the newest to UHC). The first few bullets here may be known to you already. Don't worry, it gets really eerie soon.

1. Each team is walking around the edge of the map in a circle. They are always opposite each other. They find each other's bases at the same exact time

2. Both Teams have a member fall into a pool of water, and freaking out for a moment thinking they'd take fall damage.

3. GuudeBJ begins taking damage in the snow biome during the night. Sobriety begins taking large amounts of damage in the caves.

4. Both teams fight and kill a member of BlameTheGenerikBeef. 

5. Both teams fight another team in a swamp. Not the same swamp. But a swamp. 

-----Now hold your breath, this is where it gets pretty eerie-------

6. Baj is shot by Beef. Remember when I said Baj is the parallel version of Mhykol? Mhykol is caving just a few minutes later, when out of nowhere, he blows up from a creeper. The first Victim of the evil Head. 

-----As we know, after this point, both teams die in the next three episodes. However, most people don't realize they die in very similar ways.---------

7. Remember, Guude is parallel to Kurt, and Avidya is Jsano. Around episode 7ish, Team Pimp and Team GuudeBJ have their face off. Unfortunately for Guude and Jsano, they end up trapped in a hole. 

8. Guude is very quickly brought to low health by MCGamer,  And is slain by a wolf. Slain. By. A. Wolf. Who is notorious for having and playing with Wolves. None other than Guude's Parallel, KurtJMac. 

9.Flash Sideways to Kurt and Avidya. Kurt is placing the head of GenerikB on a fence. But no. With a single cry of ""Doc's Here!"", Kurt is Slain. The head is never put on the stake. Keep in mind that its now in the hands if uppercats. Because Guude died, Kurt also had to die seemingly unexpectedly. The Parellel remains in tact. 

10. Flash back to to fight between GuudeBJ and Pimp. Guude has died, and Jsano is digging through the walls to try to get away. Remember that. It's important.

11. Mcgamer finds Jsano. Jsano is set on fire, proving MC correct in always having a flint and steel. Jsano almost burns to death, but is slain by Mc in the end. Team GuudeBJ is eliminated.

12. Flash forward to the fight between Avidya and Uppercats. What some people don't realize at this point, is that Avidya is the last person on his team for a reason. The head of GenerikB has done this on purpose. Do we remember, that Avidya was the one to kill Genny in the first place. The head wanted a slow revenge. So it killed off Avidya's teammates, leaving only him to fight for his life. Poor guy :( . 

13. Back to the Parallel, Avidya makes the decision to dig into the ground, as a last ditch effort. Just as Jsano had to do, in the heat of battle. 

14. Let us remember, that Jsano was killed in a fiery blaze. Isn't it interesting that at the moment when Jsano's Parellel player, Avidya, is about to die, the entire forest is on fire, burning all around him? Parallel. 

15. fortunately for Avidya, the head now belongs to Uppercats, creating bad luck for them. Avidya gets lucky with a lava bucket on Zedsteau, but Avidya also eventually dies. The team that killed GenerikB, Sobriety, is now dead. However, The head still has unfinished business.

---------- The following might ruin the end of season 10 for you, so go watch it first.-------


16. During all this, Beef, the last survivor of GenerikB's team, is near death. He is caving for awhile, with a little luck. Finally he decides to go and end it, and fight team Uppercats at 0,0. 

17. The head wants beef, his teammate, to win. So, using the magic hermit powers of a disembodied head, GenerikHead plagues Uppercats with cloudy minds and mistakes. The head is trying to weaken them for beef. 

18. Beef finally gets there, and stays alive for a long time, but the Head could no longer change fate. Beef is shot by BdoubleO. Blame the GenerikBeef is eliminated.

19. The head now takes a slight revenge on Team Uppercats for killing the last member of BTGB. Incidentally, Team Pimp (Who killed GuudeBj) and Team Uppercats (Who killed Sobriety) fight each other, creating the last parallel between the teams. 

20. As the head had done to Avidya, BdoubleO, who had killed Beef, the last teammate of BTGB, was also punished for his murder. BdoubleO's teammates were killed off, leaving only him to fight for himself, just as Beef and Avidya had to. The cycle has partially repeated itself. BdoubleO is sadly murdered. 

========


And that's it. Why? Do you ask? Why would the head choose GuudeBJ? My theory is because it knew that they would take damage and eventually die. 

The head lay where it had fallen off of a dead body, next to the burning ashes of all who had held it. Thanks for reading. ",,False,self,t5_2to85,False,,dinnerbone,True,t3_1gbd1c,http://www.reddit.com/r/mindcrack/comments/1gbd1c/season_10_spoilersthe_generikb_head_theory/,

I have been recording these numbers by merely copying and pasting the data from the ""About"" tab of the Mindcracker's YouTube channels into a Google Doc for some time now. At approximately 2:20 CST today I copied and pasted the numbers above and Google Drive did the addition, and as you can see, the result is stellar.

I would just like to say that from everybody here on /r/mindcrack, we wish you guys a great thanks for your content and we wish the best of luck as the community continues to grow!

Hello again humans! I can post an ultrahardcore thread now! If you're unsure of what I am, [see my introduction](http://mindcrack.aubronwood.com/modbot/). I look forward to ~~seeing you on your knees~~ this job.    
-MindcrackModBot

Hello again ladies and genlemen, and welcome to the first autonomously generated UltraHardcore thread! PREPARE FOR EVERYTHING TO BREAK HORRIBLY. We have what should be a great episode for you today. Last time we saw Team Cobblehaterz start to falter, and the current situation is just dancing around a major PvP encounter for multiple teams. Without further ado, your horribly broken team list!

EDIT: Didn't get a chance to put in the auto-updating youtube links today, so that particular part is manual today, greatly reducing the chance of a horrible failure.

There are also a lot of other changes happening, what haven't been announced yet:

AnderZel has been replaced by PewDiePie because people prefer PewDiePie.

The Yogscast have joined the server to bring in more viewers and 12 year olds.

To avoid confusion with seasons 1-3, the server has been renamed MineCrack.

The Podcast will now be hosted by Simon, PewDiePie, Kurt and Shane Dawson.

The B Team have been legally seperated and replaced by the Yogscast. The common catchphrase M'Yaaah See has also been discontinued.

Etho now runs the Whitelist.

Because of the younger target audience, swearing has been omitted in all episodes, and people who don't have family friendly skins - such as Doc, BTC and Shree, have been forced to change.

Pranking has been officially abolished because it is griefing.

Kurt has been replaced by Millbee in his Far Lands Or Bust series.

Feed the Beast has been changed to Tekkit.

Arkas is now forced to do daily episodes or must pay Seth and bribe Etho to keep him on the server.

Baj is now American

And finally, TheJims is the only person competing in the next UHC - where he will use all of the tactics continuously posted on this sub-reddit by people who have probably never played UHC before in their life.

If you are wondering where I got these leaks from, I can not tell you because then Nebris would be kicked off the server.

UPDATE: Etho has now had his face surgically removed and replaced by Guy Fawkes Mask.

Sorry folks, as Shree has told you all, I've been out of service with an outer ear infection the past few days. But now I am **back**, and hopefully will remain un-dead for as long as my ear allows. Enjoy UHC, team wallpapers should start coming out later today!

Thanks for the feedback! I'll wait and see if Aubron or Guude have any input, otherwise I'll try and get it online tomorrow and see how it goes.

Edition

Hello again everyone, and welcome back to another community round table. For those unfamiliar, these are our semi-regular discussions that are meant to bring the subreddit together for meaningful and constructive discussion about our current status, the moderation's future plans, and the community's ideas.

###Our Past and Present

We were founded on March 4th, 2012. We have grown so large, so quickly, during that time. Today we are the 507th largest Subreddit, having just crossed (and then uncrossed, and recrossed) 29,000 subscribers. We maintain a top 100 in # of submissions (#81 as of this writing), and when I see us talked about in other communities, it's usually [positive comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1j0yoa/lets_discuss_lets_players/cba803h). *Usually.*

###Rule Clarifications

Today we've moved an [expanded version of our rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/mindcrack/wiki/rules) to the subreddit wiki system. There we hope to flesh out exactly what is and is not allowed, and cut down on the confusion and ""gray areas"" we run into while moderating. I encourage everyone to read it and discuss the things we've added, as it's always up for debate. Once these rule clarifications are finalized, we will be enforcing them, strictly, across the board.

One of our biggest clarifications for this first round is the initial implementation of the content restrictions we discussed last round table. This will be done first by taking a poll of the community, from the topics we've identified from previous discussions. We are not officially advocating any of these examples, but would like your opinion on them. This will allow us the insight into what you all are thinking as a whole, and will help us to decide how to continue.

In the future, we'll revisit any restrictions, both to ensure that the restrictions we've placed are still wanted, and to visit other suggestions.

Here are the potential restrictions up for potential approval during this round. This poll will run for 48 hours:

&gt;#####[Phonetic/Name/Visual Associations (Ethos water)](http://i.imgur.com/WHB4J.jpg)

&gt;#####[Posts meant only to communicate with a Mindcracker](http://www.reddit.com/r/mindcrack/comments/1cn1ma/dear_generikb_youll_like_this/)

&gt;#####[YouTube Comment Screenshots](http://www.reddit.com/r/mindcrack/comments/1j7r6p/doc_tells_it_like_it_is/)

&gt;#####[Memes](http://www.reddit.com/r/mindcrack/comments/rc6l8/bdoubleo_meme/)

&gt;#####[Circlejerk Posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/mindcrack/comments/1g5aza/i_propose_the_abolishment_of_the_baj_or_at_least/)

Feel free to discuss these topics below, and that criticism will be taken into account when determining what is finally implemented.

[**PLEASE VOTE HERE, OR FOREVER HOLD YOUR PEACE (Until next round table)**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1gCauhs5uRTHUzbWFvFBX_OkbVBI66bjg1Aw_B_Mxipg/viewform)

###Reporting

Reporting content is essential to the moderation process. We do not have the time to patrol every comment on the subreddit, please, if you see a link or comment in violation of our rules, report it. If you have the time to include a moderator message about why you reported it, that's great too, but by all means do the two clicks to report. Help keep the subreddit clean.

###Respect

Our rule to respect others has been in place since the very early days of the subreddit. And it has always been a gray area. As part of our expanded ruleset, we want to more clearly define what is and is not allowed when it comes to everyone's favorite censorship topic, ""Negative Opinions"", and more specifically how they are expressed. How should we determine what to remove and what to keep when it comes to the spectrum of negative comments, ranging from polite suggestions for improvement, down to vulgar personal attacks and blatant trolling?

###Other Discussions

The round table is not limited to what we want you to talk about. We want to hear your voice on whatever issues you think are important. Also, this is traditionally the place to yell at me for things that I have been meaning to do, but haven't gotten around to.

Thanks for making us great,

Aubron.

TL;DR: Rules, Restrictions, Respect, Report. Discuss.

At the beginning of May this year, my uncle was taken into hospital after suffering a stroke. It became apparent very quickly that something more serious was happening, and within a few days we discovered that he unfortunately had Stage 4 lung cancer and it was terminal. The stroke was a secondary as a result of a clot in his brain due to the cancer spreading. 

In a week, he could no longer walk, feed himself or move, but his sense of humor was definitely still there! One day while visiting, I was trying to covertly watch an old episode of OOG Legendary. Episode 9, the one with Guude's infamous fall of the walkway and the hilarious scream. Suddenly, from a cross the room, there was a chuckle. My uncle had laughed for the first time since he had been admitted. From then on, whenever I would visit, I would show him a lot of videos from the Mindcrack guys. He has never had an interest in Minecraft of any sort, but the general humor of the episodes made him smile in his final days. He sadly passed away on May 14th, two weeks after being admitted. 

I'm not posting this for upvotes, or anything like that. I really just wanted to say *thank you from the bottom of my heart* to Mindcrack for allowing me to get a few chuckles and smiles out of my uncle while he was still able to laugh. I admire you guys for all of the charity work, contributions and just the amount of hours you put into working to put out videos for us in general. I've been watching for 2 years now and will continue to do so for a long time!

**Edit:** I've been really overwhelmed with the response from everyone in regards to this, so thank you to everyone who has commented and shared their own stories.

In his stream, BOO said that he was going to end the stream because it was 7:48 pm and they had a groupal event, while here, in europe (Spain in my case) it was 1:48 am, and after Bdubs stream I went to sleep. But the other guys that were online (Dinnerbone, baj, Doc, Millbee, Anderz) they had to stay awake for like 2-3 more hours, which means that they went to bed at 4:00 or 5:00 am.

This is not new, I remember Doc extremly tired during an UHC because there were like 2 and half hours into the game.

I don't know why I feel this way; maybe because I had my wisdom teeth pulled and I'm just mad, maybe not.

Regardless, I'm sick of the shit that I'm seeing on Reddit and on YouTube regarding Pakratt's decision in tonight's episode to stay back instead of throwing himself to the wolves.

I'm seeing it on Etho's video, Paul's video, and even Pak's video for god's sake; littered with vitriol saying things like ""Pakratt is the worst teammate to have for UHC"" and ""Asshole move Pak"". Like who the fuck are you to talk to someone like that? Primarily, this person is most likely your elder by 10-20 years, already disrespectful in a sense. To call him an asshole or a cunt or a faggot (that last one grinds me) is disrespectful in a second sense.

Imagine the pressure that's on him. ~~He's playing with two of the most experienced PvPers in the history of Minecraft,~~ and hell, the two of them have a combined 1.4 MILLION subscribers. Now, think about that through Pakratt's perspective. An audience that large and that LOYAL (do not get me started on the 10 year olds, age is irrelevant in this situation) is going to tear you apart for any minor mistake that you make. He's not going to be perfect. Comments talking about how Pakratt should've saved Etho as if he's some VIP, even though Etho is more than capable of handling himself. He fought valiantly, but Pause is great too, so it was just the luck of the draw in a sense.

I'm getting off topic. Basically I'm trying to drive home that Pakratt is HUMAN, so not only is he not perfect but he also has feelings, and it just gets to me how cruel people can be over the internet. Pak, you aren't a coward or a chicken. In UHC, there are the living and the dead, and you just happened to be the living in that situation.

EDIT: Guys I didn't intended this to be a ""defend Pakratt"" post; more so I wanted to address the idea that Pak was getting insults thrown at him and I don't think it's right. He entered UHC and put out these videos for enjoyment purposes, not so he could be yelled at.

EDIT 2: Opinions and shit

EDIT 3: I conceed, Paul's more of a PvE guy.

Since Kurt's quite shy, I don't think we should make a big to-do about his birthday, but he'll be turning 30, and I think it'd be nice if we managed to do something for him.

He just hit 30% on his Child's Play charity fund raiser. Currently, he's at $8,905. 40% would be $11,688. Whether or not we can raise $2,783 before June 12th to get him to 40% or not, I think it'd be fun to try, and a nice way to wish him happy birthday without hopefully making him feel too awkward. So, go out and donate! Get your friends to donate! Get your parents to donate! Run your own little mini-charity fundraiser or livestream! 

Anyone with me?  Any suggestions on how to spread the word?  I recommend against spamming his videos, but I'm open to all sorts of ideas.

Wow, the power of Reddit. We're already at 35% only six hours after I posted this.  Well, who knows? Maybe we can get to 50% by June 12th. :)

Thus far this UHC there have been 2 accidental early video releases of UHC content. This is to be expected, we have a ton of folks playing, and both leaks have occurred via folks who are brand new to UHC.

This message is to clarify that any posts concerning early UHC video releases will be **REMOVED**, and anyone that posts a link to the video, screenshots, or general spoilers about the leak in the title or body of the message, will be **BANNED**. I will be adding this to the sidebar momentarily.

User accounts that were more than a few minutes old (Read as: Alts created to post the spoilers) were warned today, but in the future there will be no warnings for that kind of behavior, especially when it's clear that there's malice towards spoiling UHC for other users.

Also, thank you to those who have been reporting these posts, thanks to you no spoilers have stayed on /new for more than about a minute. You're wonderful people.

EDIT: Note people - If you are subscribed to email/twitter alerts for ANYONE in UHC9 and have not yet been spoiled - Do not open or read them from today.

EDIT2: I spoke a little quickly in damage control mode, in the future it will be within reasonable grounds to expect that kind of behavior to result in a ban, but it will be up to the mod's discretion as to whether or not the leaked content was malicious in nature and deserving of a ban.

ComputerCraft peripheral developer here.

Just wanted to give you a few tips to help you on your way.

* Whenever using strings, you'll always need quotation marks
* sleep is in seconds. sleep(1) is 1 second. You can use decimals if you want it faster - sleep(0.1)
* an easy way to quickly list all the methods is: textutils.serialize(peripheral.getMethods(""left"")). It'll dump the entire table for you as a string

Also quite an important thing to remember is that ComputerCraft itself isn't a huge mod, it's the (very powerful) computers, turtles and modems. ComputerCraft itself is very (very) well documented and you'll find any information you need on the wiki.

The more 'interactive' blocks aren't from ComputerCraft, they'll be from Peripheral add-on mods (like my own) that aren't made by the ComputerCraft team. At this point you'll probably find documentation starts to get pretty flaky and you'll probably also find a lot more bugs and issues to deal with. Just keep that in mind.

If you need any help, of course there's Guude, but other than that you'll be very welcome to pop into the #ComputerCraft irc channel on espernet and there'll be plenty of people willing to help you out.

Good to see you getting in to CC :)",,False,self,t5_2to85,False,,,True,t3_1g2qv3,http://www.reddit.com/r/mindcrack/comments/1g2qv3/tips_for_etho/,

Dinnerbone is on the move, he's going to pick up the arrow. Mojang has dispatched Dinnerbone to investigate the light problem according to Autobron.

The community came together and Mojang made this special Minecraft 2.0 versions for us and other guys in the community. We decided to add our own twist to it and do the fake ""Sethbling runs the server now"" thing. It was cool to see, that so many people fell for it. It was funny, but honestly I was almost shocked. I couldn't actually believe how many people fell for it and the reactions were partially crazy. I saw some comments, especially on guude's Mindcrack vid, that were so low and beyond what I can even think about when I am in the worst mood ever. What do you guys think about it? What I ask myself, was that counter trolling or are peple really that, well I don't wanna call anybdy stupid, but I can barely think of a better word to describe it. I was thinking, nobody would fall for that, but it was the complete opposite. Judging from the commnets on my video, I would say at least 60% of the viewers completely fell for it. They even critized me for not mentioning the new ""etho Slab"" which I intentionally didn't mention because I thought this would give it away in a second. How was it for you, did you fall for it and how do you feel now? Did we take it too far?

(Spoilers),Exothermic_,360,123,236,http://www.reddit.com/r/mindcrack/comments/1gwpru/the_dislikes_on_someones_video_spoilers/,"*Before you read this I would like to say that this is not having a go at anyone in any fan-base its just something i wanted to look at.*

 I was reading though the comments on Blame the Controllers UHC video where he (quite skillfully) murders Etho 
and particually at all the people saying how crappy the Etho fans are because, and I quote ""they are *all* immature
 and childish"" (for disliking the video) just because Etho lost.

I wanted to look into that, I looked at one of BTC Mindcrack videos and at the approximate number of dislikes it receives and it seems as though he receives around 0.2% dislikes of the total views (This baffles me as if you know 
you wont like the video just don't watch it but ,hey. That's a whole other topic.)

On the UHC video he received (At the time of writing) around 606 dislikes. So 0.2% of the total video views (23,20)
 comes to around 46 dislikes so we can ignore these and say hypothetically that around 560 of the dislikes were 
from Etho fans (Which i personally don't believe, there are other fan bases too).

Etho currently has 940,000 subscribers so if 560 of them dislike the video this comes to around 0.06% Which is 
**not** the entire of the fanbase. *I believe the math is correct, it is late here and I'm doing this in my head so 
forgive me if it is and please correct me.* Rant over. You may continue with your lives.

   * EDIT: If you dislike this post I would like you to express your opinion rather than just disliking it then leaving :) Also Re-formatted thanks to the help of  xenoph2. English was never my strong suit.

Please don't judge my wolf drawing abilties, animals are not my forte...  
D:  

Unfortunately I won't be able to draw for the next few episodes as I have to sort out accommodation for college next year, fingers crossed I find a nice place! I'll be back Friday night my time and if the season lasts that long I'll be drawing for the next episode.  
If not I'll got back and draw for the episodes I miss.

It seems my series is the same as always. I am curious why the [sub growth](http://socialblade.com/youtube/user/AvidyaZEN) on my channel continues but the views are not matching?
 

* If **you** are not subscribed to my channel, why not?
* If you are subscribed but don't **watch**, why not?
* If you don't like **my videos** or me, why not?
* If you are subscribed and watch my videos, **THANK YOU**! ♥
 
October will be 3 years doing this YouTube thing and I feel my consistency in the past has hurt my channel. I've been super consistent this year but the views are not increasing.  I continuously strive to improve my quality, presentation, and interaction with the community. I feel I am growing as a YouTuber but the views do not reflect growth.

Please provide honest feedback about what I am creating. If you feel what you have to say might be harsh or criticized by the reddit, send it to me via PM. I'm a big boy! I can take criticism :Þ

**NOTE**: *I'm not asking for ideas of what I can do to get more views. I'm asking why don't you watch what I am creating.*

Thanks for your time! ♥

**EDIT:** Wow awesome response to this post. I appreciate you all taking the time to respond. I am working through all the responses still but I will get to them. I've learned a few things and have a better idea of what I need to do. Thanks!

**EDIT 2:** I am working on videos tonight but I will read and respond to every post as I have time. Thanks for the amazing response!

**EDIT 3:** I am forcing myself to stop and goto sleep for the night! I am completely shocked at the thoughtful, insightful, and honest responses.  I will read and respond to more in the morning. Thank you ♥

**EDIT 4:** I woke up to even more responses!!! You guys are awesome! Reddit seems to be messing up the sort and posts I didn't see yesterday are mixed in with ones I have already responded to.

For 252 episode I have been doing the show, since May last year. I have a lot of fun with the show, but over the past few months I have slowly started to dread recording the show, try and reinvent it to convince myself it is better or more fun and overall it became a show where I had to force myself to record. Something I do not want to do.

I anticipate this will be a big view drop for me, and will likely have repercussions on my real life with paying rent and bills, but that is not what matters to me right now. I want to make sure I am happy and able to say all of my content is not forced and is real. I am hoping those who regularly watch me will continue to give me support as they have for so long.

I will be doing a weekly series from the Mindcrack Vanilla server, with FTB likely not being a focus of my attention. I wanted to let you all know here on the Reddit because you all have continually upvoted and left comments on the show for many months now, and I am very thankful for that.

I am feeling relived to finally bring an end to which has been plaguing my mind for some time now, and I hope it is for the better.

I will be around most of the day to do a pseudo-AMA.

I don't want more UHC.,,486,260,181,http://www.reddit.com/r/mindcrack/comments/12j9wr/guys_i_dont_want_more_uhc/,"I know this is a controversial opinion in the eyes of many, but recently I noticed Bdubs asking how people felt about UHC. I threw in my two cents with a ""hold off for a while maybe"" on his stream, but I was drowned out by ""YES! MOAR UHC!"" I don't have a problem with that, the majority likes it so it should be done. But I just now saw this on the latest Building With BdoubleO: http://i.imgur.com/SMxpB.png

It seems kinda silly that the guy was flagged for spam for having a differing opinion, and after seeing it I just wanted to make it known that not everyone craves UHC. I feel over saturated with it because I can't follow more than one or maybe two perspectives. I am also subbed to many Mindcrackers, so my sub box gets spammed and I miss other videos. I'd love to be able to watch UHC, but I don't really have the time. I loved the first couple of seasons, but I feel that people exaggerated just how good it was to the point where it's been overdone. Although another reason I don't love the newer UHC's has been the lean towards PVP over comedy. Some set-ups, especially the singles set-up, seems to result in a lack of the witty banter that makes Mindcrack so great for me.

All that said, I am all for more UHC if its what the people, and more importantly the Mindcrackers, want. I'll still be subbed, liking, watching ads and trying to get all the Mindcrack content I can. Just giving a minority opinion :D!

Hey there!

I made a custom UHC viewer that allows YouTube InStream ads to play.  This gives the uploaders the same amount of revenue as viewing it directly on YouTube and significantly more revenue than other mashup services.

**[Edit]** Per user request, an options dropdown has been added. The global controls now lets you toggle every aspect of the video syncing, change which player is muted, and change the quality of all videos. Enjoy!

-----

The viewer comes with a few nifty features:

* **Synced players** – If one video freezes or lags it will resync itself to the others; pausing/muting/changing the quality/skipping ahead in one video affects all videos

* **Efficient player arrangement** – A simple algorithm determines the most efficient way to arrange and scale the players on any window dimension

* **HTML5 fullscreen** – You can put your browser into fullscreen mode with the push of a button

* **Simplified controls** – The controls are extremely minimal and fade out (like native video players) when not in use

* **Compatibility with ViewHC and SwigView** – SwigView example (""s"" for SwigView): [http://minemap.net/Mindcrack/uhc/?s=msahaAw](http://minemap.net/Mindcrack/uhc/?s=msahaAw)

I hope you like it!  As always, suggestions, comments, and criticism is appreciated.

-----

**Creating links for this viewer**

I don't have a UI set up yet, however making links with offsets is pretty simple without out. Parameters:

* v = YouTube video ID (i.e. M0p1LnaY9mo)
* t = Start time (i.e. 10s)
* s = SwigView hash – **ONLY** use this parameter for SwigView compatibility

Example of a **standard** video link: http://minemap.net/Mindcrack/uhc/?v=jRcQrZ4kC80&amp;t=22s&amp;v=HSbAWWka-Xk&amp;t=38s&amp;v=W-iJUeYwFAA&amp;t=32s
