1345110431.0,106,self.SEO,ybabv,A week ago I knew nothing about SEO... here’s what I’ve learned.,s13_eisbaer,122,16,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/ybabv/a_week_ago_i_knew_nothing_about_seo_heres_what/,"About twelve years ago I built a few websites; mostly for myself, but also a few for small businesses and family friends. These were the days when the search market was split between sites like Yahoo!, AltaVista, WebCrawler, Ask Jeeves, Excite, Lycos and of course Google; when dial-up connections ruled the world and marquee text and frames were (almost) acceptable parts of website design. After a few years my interests changed and I didn’t have as much time to spend on developing websites.


Recently I was given the opportunity to start in the role of SEO Assistant at [VroomVroomVroom](http://www.vroomvroomvroom.com.au). It’s been a long time since I was au fait with the world of website development and search engines, but my love of technology and background in marketing meant that I wasn’t going to turn this exciting opportunity down. The task given to me for the first week was to research SEO and learn as much as possible... and boy, was I in for a shock!


I thought I knew the basics of SEO. I was wrong. The landscape of search has changed so much in the last ten or so years. Even my Luddite mother knows that Google has a tight grip on the search market these days, however what I didn’t realise was how much SEO has changed in that time. Apparently keywords in meta tags no longer matter, and submitting your website to be added to search engines is a thing of the past. Content is king now, and the search engines focus on the end-user, not on the webmaster. This was a whole new world for me to discover, and here’s what I found:

* SEO is hugely important to the success of a website. The top three results on the search engine results page (SERP) attract [nearly 60% of the clicks](http://searchenginewatch.com/article/2049695/Top-Google-Result-Gets-36.4-of-Clicks-Study). If you can manage to get your website to rank in the top results for your desired keywords, it will mean a huge increase in the number of visitors (potential customers).

* Keyword research is vitally important to the success of SEO. It should be the first step in any SEO plan, and one that is often not done properly. There are many tools available to help with keyword research, including [Wordtracker](https://freekeywords.wordtracker.com/) and [SEO Book’s keyword suggestion tool](http://tools.seobook.com/keyword-tools/seobook/) as well as [Google AdWords](https://adwords.google.com/select/KeywordToolExternal).

* Search indexing and ranking is a lot smarter than it used to be. Search engines like Google display sites they believe are authoritative and relevant, higher up in the search results. They measure relevance by analysing page content, and they measure authority (mostly) based on the number and quality of other pages linking to the pages they show. Links are like votes.

* Instead of using the old &lt;META&gt; keywords tags in the code of websites, search engines send out “crawlers” (also known as “spiders” or “robots”) that read the content on web pages, and scour the content of each page for keywords. Search engines like Google actually use [machine learning](http://www.seomoz.org/blog/how-googles-panda-update-changed-seo-best-practices-forever-whiteboard-friday), and these crawlers can even tell the difference between content that is relevant and has been written by a human, and a page simply stuffed full of keywords to try and rank higher in search results. They also pay attention to the layout of the page, and will rank keywords depending on where they appear on the page. Certain things like number of links can also affect results.

* Whilst the technical side of SEO is very important (after all, if the search engines can’t read your site, then nothing else matters), content is king when it comes to search engine rankings. Search engines these days are geared towards the end user and what they want, rather than just organising websites by keywords.

* Content needs to be well written and contain keywords and phrases that users will search for. However, due to recent Google updates ([Panda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Panda) and [Penguin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Penguin)), rankings are penalised for anything that looks like it was written specifically to improve search rankings (i.e. link spamming). At the end of the day, content should be useful and relevant, and something that keeps users coming back. Regular updates are important for SEO as well. Search algorithms like “FreshRank” test to see how recent/up-to-date the contents of the page are, and will rank more recently updated pages higher (depending on the topic). Blog posts are a good way to keep content updated on a regular basis.

* In addition to content (which provides the keywords for search), the ranking of pages can be affected by links to and from external websites. Google terms this “[PageRank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank)”. Each time your website is linked to by an external site, your PageRank increases. The more trust or respect a website has, the more weight their links will hold (e.g. if your website is linked to by Wikipedia or the New York Times, those links will increase your PageRank a lot more than a link from someone’s personal blog). Building links is an important part of SEO, however building the wrong links can be detrimental to your website’s ranking. If the links coming to or from your website are low-ranking or untrustworthy sites (e.g. known for spam) then your ranking on the SERP will decrease.


So really at the end of the day, modern SEO is all about creating your website with the end-user in mind. You need to provide content that is fresh and relevant, and provides value to the user. Not only will it help you rank better in search results, but it will keep the users coming back! Search engines are getting a lot smarter, and with machine learning they’re becoming more “human-like” in their assessment of websites. Page layout should also be built with the customer in mind, not aimed specifically at trying to rank higher in search engines. Panda and Penguin could spell the beginning of the end in terms of black-hat SEO techniques, which can only be a good thing for both the customer and the legitimate business website.


**tl;dr** What I’ve learned about SEO in the last week could really be boiled down into two important points:

1. **Build your website with the customer in mind**; and
2. **SEO is a constantly changing field.** If you’re out of the loop, then you’ll quickly fall behind. Keep up to date by reading industry websites and blogs. A few of my favourites are:

* The Daily SEO Blog - http://www.seomoz.org/blog
* SEOBook Blog - http://www.seobook.com/blog
* Search Engine Watch - http://searchenginewatch.com/
* Search Engine Land - http://searchengineland.com/

Thanks, everyone, for the [absolutely astonishing response](http://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/tmc84/most_useful_seo_articles_of_the_last_week_051412/) to my test post last week. I'm tremendously flattered. 

Needless to say, unless otherwise indicated, I'll be doing these weekly roundups for a while now! 

So! For those of you who weren't leaning on the upvote button last week - my name's Hugh, and I read basically everything written each week about SEO practises, technique and theory. That's not because I'm procrastinating from work - it's because I run a site called [Internet Marketing Gourmet](http://www.internetmarketinggourmet.com), which is essentially BoingBoing for SEOs, internet marketers, and other folks in similar fields. Every week I pick through the good, the bad and the ugly out there in the blogosphere, and feature the best stuff. 

As a result, I collect a whacking pile of useful SEO links every week, from everyone from the top blogs to little guys you've probably never heard of. And so, I thought a filtered roundup would be useful to /r/SEO - and here it is! 

I'm not paid to promote these links, and none of them are affiliate links. I just think they're handy. 

This week we've been seeing the aftershocks of Penguin, still - but also a lot of new and exciting techniques coming up. I particularly like the info on semantic keyword research - useful stuff. 

* [Quick check for Google Penguin?](http://www.seroundtable.com/google-penguin-check-15165.html) - You may have already seen this one - but in case you haven't, here's a quick tip for a Google query that may reveal if your site was hit by the Penguin. 
* [50 guest posts going live in one day](http://thinktraffic.net/50-guest-posts-one-day?) - Not specifically an SEO post, but this article on guest posting reveals how one guy managed to get himself 50 high-ranking backlinks going live on one day. Lots of useful ideas and info here. 
* [9 lessons from 1000 SEO questions](http://www.seomoz.org/blog/9-lessons-from-1000-seo-questions?) - Dr Pete at SEOMoz has compiled answers to all the most common SEO questions he gets asked. Something useful for all but the most advanced SEOs here. 
* [Faking Link Removal Notices](http://pointblankseo.com/faking-link-removal-notices?) - Point Blank SEO alerts us to another nasty potential Negative SEO technique, post-Penguin. Interested to hear how plausible people think this one is. 
* [5 tips for conducting semantic keyword research](http://www.searchenginejournal.com/5-tips-for-conducting-semantic-keyword-research/43538/) - Semantic keywords are the new... well... keywords. Or something. Regardless, great suggestions for expanding keyword research to take advantage of the new algorithms' semantic recognition. 
* [Protect your Google Analytics from hacking](http://blog.kissmetrics.com/protect-analytics-from-hacking/?) - Here's a very nasty trick someone could play on your Analytics - and how to prevent it. 
* [Your ""Natural"" backlink structure won't look natural to Google](https://www.keywordstrategy.org/1321/the-natural-backlink-profile-youre-building-will-look-totally-unnatural-to-google/) - Fraser Cain being contrarian about linkbuilding, with some really interesting points and great data. Like Rand Fishkin, he's definitely On A Side, but this is still a very interesting read. 
* [This SEO Life](http://www.thisseolife.com/) - If you do SEO, you'll find this funny. Very funny. 

And that's it for this week! Let me know what you thought of this week's roundup, if there's anything you'd like to see in the roundup, and so on! 

Quick plug - if you found these links useful, we're posting more, every day, on http://www.internetmarketinggourmet.com . But fear not - they'll also be on Reddit every Monday as long as they're useful!

Since I began producing content specifically for Pinterest in the last month, I finally have a large dataset and understanding of users to study. To test the specific impact that a Pinterest-only marketing campaign can have one a site, my girlfriend Alaina was gracious enough to let me work on her sunglass boutique site which was only averaging 20-30 page views daily. With careful research on what, when, and how to submit to Pinterest I quickly began to take over the “popular” section of Pinterest and grow her site to over 100,000 visitors within the first month.
So what did I learn from these first 100,000 visitors and from a month of daily Pinterest marketing? Here are 6 simple lessons:

**Lesson 1: Be Pretty:**

If you’re planning to submit a traditional infographic to Pinterest with the hopes of it going big (assuming it’s not about Ryan Gosling) then the graphic will probably need a redesign. I have found that with Pinterest, infographics containing light and visually appealing colors (such as light blues, pinks, and yellows) have far more success than those that keep their neutral layout. Why is this? Once your infographic hits the “new” page in any specific category there is only a small 10 minute window for the content to be repinned or liked. If you’re a new user with a small follower base this method is your only chance at going viral. If it doesn’t happen, you will have to wait another hour to try the submission again (see my blog for the Pinterest algorithm update). Since Pinterest is a visual pinboard, it will be in your best interest to redesign the infographic to be as color coordinated and appealing from far away as possible. I have also found that including actual pictures as opposed to graphics works significantly better on the boards.

**Lesson 2: Size Matters:**

When submitting any graphic to Pinterest, this is the absolute biggest lesson that most marketers have failed to learn. My rule of thumb: if it’s over 5,000 pixels long, it doesn’t belong. Why is this so important? Because the REPIN and LIKE buttons are at the TOP of the submission. If a user has to scroll a mile just to see the entire image then it’s very unlikely they will scroll back up to press the buttons that really matter. But not to worry, it is still possible to go viral on Pinterest with that monster of a graphic. To combat the “size” problem, create a simple, square image in photoshop outlining the graphics title. Make it simple, pretty, and to the point. If you’ve been on Pinterest for any time at all, I’m sure you’ve seen the image to the left. There’s a reason for that.

**Lesson 3: Perfect Timing:**

When it comes to other social networks the timing of submission is somewhat arbitrary. However, Pinterest seems to stick to a daily schedule of when their users decide to crash my servers with traffic. That is why every single day I am at my computer ready to combat the eventual onslaught of what I like to call “Before and After Work Traffic”. 6AM and 6PM eastern time, every weekday, this happens. With the exception of Fridays, when the spike tends to hit at 4PM.
What does this mean? First of all, Pinterest users are very devoted workers. Second of all, the perfect time to submit your image to Pinterest is at either 5AM or 5PM. After a good hour of your content gaining momentum and traction within the boards your content will be highly visible during the peak hours. There is a catch, however, in that lately Pinterest’s servers have been having trouble keeping up with the large influx in traffic during these times. If Pinterest seems to be loading slowly or is going in or out, it’s best to just hold off on the submission for another time.

**Lesson 4: Honesty Goes a Long Ways**

I would be a liar if I said I didn’t have more than one Pinterest account. As a matter of fact, I have several (all for science). The most successful account that I’ve had is a novelty account devoted to being a woman’s best friend. With this account I have never been negative or submitted anything to the boards, however, I just cruise the popular section handing out free advice and honest opinions. By doing this on the popular boards, with a novel name (I used a picture of Ryan Gosling just for the heck of it) I was able to establish over 100 followers within a week. Just like on every other social network I can confirm that novelty accounts do work on Pinterest.

**Lesson 5: Be a Creative Friend**

Every morning when I wake up, I check the popular section to see what’s trending. It’s typically food ideas, some shoes, and a Ryan Gosling “Hey Girl” for good measures. However, every once and a while I will see an infographic of viral that made it through the pits to “Popular” page glory. If I see anything on the popular page that I think I would ever possibly make in the future, I make a note of it in my notebook and go about my business. The point is: I would never want to burden the Pinterest community with something that’s been done before. Much like the other social networks, the users of Pinterest recognize copies or reposted material. While you may have some immediate success in the short run, a well thought-out and creative post will bring in 100x the traffic than cheating your way. This also means, however, that your content will be submitted 9Gag at one point or another and repinned via Pinterest. This is bad because 9Gag is the mortal enemy to all original content creators. I have found that by skimming the Popular boards on Pinterest every few hours for your content you will eventually run across an instance where your submission has been rehosted. I nicely leave a comment accrediting the original source and more often than not the Pinterest user edits the submission to the correct link.

**Lesson 6: Don't Suffocate**

This lesson is where probably 90% of the new businesses I see trying to make an impact on Pinterest fail. If you have a business account on Pinterest and someone has chosen to follow your pins, then chances are they are aware of your products have have visited your page to see what you have to offer. If your only plan with Pinterest is to only pin your products or images from your site, then chances are you will fail miserably. A great rule of thumb I like to tell my clients is only 1 pin per day showcasing a product. The rest of the pins should be advice, insights, or something funny that relates to the industry and account itself. Whole Foodsnever pins any sort of products to their boards, and for good reason. They have chosen to remain true to their core values and only pin about:
Caring about the community and the environment Promoting healthy eating and education to our stakeholders Selling the highest quality organic and natural foods available Creating ongoing win-win partnerships with our suppliers By using this approach they have gained over 15,000 followers who follow them for what they believe in, not for what they sell.",,False,,t5_2qhbx,True,,,True,t3_qd7ss,http://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/qd7ss/what_women_want_6_lessons_from_my_first_100k/,
1323316923.0,41,self.SEO,n4cuf,Stop Fucking Around With SEO Agencies – You Need PR,seobollocks,59,18,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/n4cuf/stop_fucking_around_with_seo_agencies_you_need_pr/,"For those of you who misunderstood, my [first post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/n3f57/seo_what_a_load_of_bollocks/) was introducing the fact that I'll be doing a series of posts in the coming weeks and months. So, onto today's rant/lesson:

SEO companies are full of “experts” who have no grounding in traditional marketing techniques – for example, they’ve never looked at editorial calendars, hell, most of them have never even heard about them.

For those of you who don’t know, magazines, newspapers and other publications plan months in advance for what they’re going to write about. Editorial calendars let people in the PR world know when to pitch their stories, and to whom.

We all know that to get a site ranked, you need to build links. We also know that getting legitimate links is the most diabolically frustrating, tedious, monotonous, soul destroying process if you follow conventional wisdom, which goes something like this: write great content and magical internet fairies will link to your site.

What a load of bollocks.

People who bend the rules might buy links or use software to spam, but these methods are short sighted.

What you need to do is get your link on high profile, high traffic websites. You need to be using a PR freelancer or agency to be scouring editorial calendars for online publications and getting them to hound hundreds of journalists each month to get them to promote your site. (EDIT: [here is the poor mans approach I discussed in a comment below](http://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/n4cuf/stop_fucking_around_with_seo_agencies_you_need_pr/c366xzx))

PR agencies who have adapted to online publications are rejoicing, and for good reason, they have a solid understanding of how marketing works and can deliver something that a lot of small to medium sized SEO companies can't offer.

If you want to have a go at doing this yourself, there are really expensive services you can sign up to which will give you contact details for journalists and bloggers. Forget that, just find the biggest magazines, news outlets and blogs in your niche and find their editorial calendars.

Remember: your links should generate targeted traffic. If they’re not doing that, you’re either doing it wrong or you’ve hired a snake oil salesman. If you're wasting your time scouring for directories, leaving comments on blogs, adding forum signatures or any other of the low level link building techniques, you're doomed to failure.

Instead of spending 20 hours a week doing that, spend 20 hours a week focusing on one publication. Spend days getting the copy perfect, spend days preparing your pitch, spend days researching your target journalist and you will get a result which will blow your and your clients socks off.

One link can result in hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of visitors and the snowball effect will be the social media world sharing the article, spreading your site and raving about it until the cows come home. And yes, Google is focusing on social media indicators a lot more, this will also boost your ranks.

As part of my [Internet Marketing Gourmet](http://www.internetmarketinggourmet.com) project, I'm reading just about everything out there in the blogosphere about SEO right now, and so I thought I'd share the most useful links I've found with /r/SEO. 

Let me know if you find this useful! If it's handy, I can think about making this a weekly thing. 

FYI, none of these links are mine, I'm not being paid to advertise any of them, and none of them have any affiliate-link attachments. They're just stuff I found that was really good. 

So, the week ending May 11th 2012, then... It looks like Batman's been in town, because everyone's stopped panicking quite as much about the (Google) Penguin. That's meant we've seen a range of good advice this week, including news of a really exciting new feature in Analytics: 

* Everyone's worried about the return of negative SEO right now, but Search Engine Land [went to the source - Matt Cutts himself](http://searchengineland.com/google-talks-penguin-update-recover-negative-seo-120463), and present some pretty compelling arguments that it's nothing you need to worry about right now. They've also got some really solid advice I've not seen elsewhere on recovering from the Penguin if you got hit, although it's not all cheery stuff! 
* [One Simple Tactic That Can Give You an Unfair Advantage in Local Search](http://www.ducttapemarketing.com/blog/2012/05/07/one-simple-tactic-that-can-give-you-an-unfair-advantage-in-local-search/) - this post does exactly what it says on the tin - from the guys at Duct Tape Marketing, it gives the details of a simple tactic you can use to - in many cases - dominate local search results. 
* [What type of links should we be getting?](http://pointblankseo.com/type-of-links) - One of the best post-Penguin advice posts I've seen, Point Blank SEO offer a massive list of link-building techniques that will enable you to rank sites post-Penguin, alongside an explanation of what exactly the Penguin was up to. 
* [Creative Link Building for Ecommerce Sites | SEOmoz](http://www.seomoz.org/blog/creative-link-building-for-ecommerce-sites) - Awesome, and incredibly long, list of ideas from SEOMoz for how to get links to product pages - not traditionally the easiest of things to persuade people to link to. 
* [Discover Links Using Google Analytics New Backlink URL Report](http://searchengineland.com/google-analytics-backlink-report-120235) - Search Engine Land reveals the new Social Backlinks tool which the guys at Google have hidden away in the rather arcane depths of the Social Media section of Analytics. This one's jawdropping if you have an active site - check it out now!

BTW, if you find this useful - the reason I've got all these links is because I've just started running [Internet Marketing Gourmet](http://www.internetmarketinggourmet.com), where I read through hundreds of blogs on all aspects of running a business online, including a lot of SEO and other inbound marketing stuff, and provide short daily links and summaries of the best and most useful bits. /r/entrepreneur really liked it and a lot of people are saying it's helpful - have a look if it sounds like the kind of thing you'd find useful! 

We also run a weekly newsletter with the very best of the week in it, if you'd prefer a weekly thing.

1. Get an [Adwords account](http://adwords.google.com/).  This will let you play with some of the tools.  Don't worry, you can't be billed if you don't enter billing information.

2. Check out the [Google Toolkit](http://www.google.com/ads/agency/toolkit.html#tab=create).  Tools like Google Trends, Keyword Tool, AdWords Campaign Experiments, Ad Preview Tool, Contextual Targeting Tool, etc will be critical to the success of your AdWords education and campaigns.

3. Do some reading on [Keyword Research](http://www.seomoz.org/beginners-guide-to-seo/keyword-research).

4. Get access to [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) for a couple of sites.  Ask a friend or boss for access.  Spend some time looking at the organic search terms, and comparing them to the paid search terms that your PPC specialist bids on.  Pay special attention to the terms which have a high conversion rate vs. terms with high traffic and low conversion rates.

5. Read every article on the [Google Adwords Certification Program Learning Center](http://support.google.com/adwords/certification/?hl=en&amp;rd=1).  Use your Adwords account to interact with as many of the subjects in these articles as you can.

6.  Create a campaign for a website, which you never intend to launch.  Use all of the tools available to you.  Tweak it to the point that you wouldn't feel bad about actually launching the campaign.

7. Work on a real, live, Adwords Campaign.  Your first Adwords campaign should be for a local charity.  [Google Grants](http://www.google.com/grants/) legit charities $10k/month in free Adwords.

I know reddit can't be people's lives and believe me my day job and side projects keep me plenty busy but I would love for this community to grow.

As it stands, there are a lot of misconceptions, poor quality posts, downright terrible advice, etc going around. We need your help to clean this up and foster this community. I see repeated questions that have been addressed time and time again. Beginner guides, should I buy links, where should I learn, can someone evaluate my site for free, etc.

Time and time again I see people coming to the sub to look for advice and things like go to fiverr end up with upvotes. I believe, as do others, that in order to foster a community and create discussion and reciprocation, education is key. Case studies, interaction, AMAs from people other than vendors. These things will weed out the people that only want to take and not give back.

Perhaps this is not something the mods intend for this community and if so, I understand. But, if this is something that you, the users, would like to see develop then I think we need to take action. How you ask? 

For one, I would like to nominate Clayburn as a 3rd mod. He is the director of SEO at Catalyst, an awesome agency in NYC. He speaks often at conferences and is very active in the SEO community as well as in this sub. While zschuessler and CLEARLYREBEL have been good, I think having a mod that's a more active participant in the sub would serve the community well.

After continual failure to not play nicely (buying spammy links and 'targeted traffic networks'..twice..the most recent of which triggered the new GWT spam links warning), we decided it was best to part ways.

The new SEO person (a yahoo they hired in-house with no actual experience; I've dealt with the guy in another context) emailed me insisting that I initiate a transfer of the domain to their account.

1. I didn't buy the domain. It's in customer-owned the GoDaddy account that they received login info for when I ""handed over the keys"". They (the new SEO person) still insist that I ""control the domain"".

2. They've already broken the current site (it's still living on my managed hosting). It requires a hefty chunk of resources; it pulls around 150GB of bandwidth and I've set it up so it uses Cloudfront to deliver video and audio podcasts, along with other general CDN duties. It's a heavily modified install of WordPress to meet their needs (I did the back-end programming for this site). They are going to move it to a 'unlimited' hosting account with GoDaddy to save money. We'll see how long GoDaddy lets it live with the resource pull it requires.

What's most amusing is that all this is going down at the end of the week, and Saturday is their big day (25K uniques versus &lt;10K during a weekday). With the site broken and no hope for it to be up on their biggest lead generation day...I think that $100/month for hosting is a bit pound foolish.

Write new content often. I tried something on my site three months ago. I made sure to write a new post every single day. After awhile I noticed that Google was crawling me twice a day, so I made sure to have two posts per day. Now it's crawling me at least 4 times a day. Basically, when I post something, in a few hours, Google has crawled it.

I don't quite understand how it works, but I know that my pageviews have more than doubled. My site income has more than doubled. One reason of course, is because I'm creating more content. But there is something to creating regular, new original content that has benefited me more than just about anything I've done.

There seem to be too many people out there who spend more time working on getting traffic than they do about making stuff. I'm not trying to criticize this group at all, you've been really helpful (and I know the majority of you get it). I just think that making useful content, in the longrun, is what wins with SEO.

Hello everyone! 

I hope y'all are having a wonderful Tuesday. 

As the community grows larger and larger, there will be a larger amount of spam coming through. This is just a fact of life. 

Another factor that comes into play with our community is our knowledge of backlinks. We love getting new backlinks. Because of this, our spam filter tends to work on overdrive, even for our small community, because of how many people are submitting their own blogs/sites. If you submit your own site, there is more of a chance that it will get filtered. 

We don't mind if you submit your own site, in fact, *I would prefer it*. I think people should be rewarded for their good work. And if [r/SEO](http://reddit.com/r/SEO) can make their good works more well known, I am all for it. 

**There are rules to submitting your own site.**

*If you are submitting your own site, it needs to be your own work. For the love of Google, don't copy work that other people did, put it on your own site, and then submit it. This is just rude, and it isn't tolerated here at [r/SEO](http://reddit.com/r/SEO).

*You must be contributing something to the community. This subreddit was originally intended for SEO enthusiasts. The idea being that everyone had a good general concept of SEO already. This subreddit is for things that you have found out or tested or news on SEO. There needs to be a contribution, not something that has been said a million times before. Puff pieces where you expand ""SEO is good for your site"" into 500 words, or ""You need to get backlinks and good content"" will be immediately removed, and I will shake my fist at your username. Don't make me shake my fist! 

If you are looking for a beginners guide, this really isn't the place. Check out http://www.seomoz.org/beginners-guide-to-seo. Keep in mind, I am going to assume that most people here have already read or know this data when looking at submissions.

Generally all self.posts will be approved, but if you need to reference a site, even if it is your own site, **USE THE URL**. There is no need to use anchor text. We know what you're doing. 

The last thing, and I can't believe I even have to say this, stop advertising your SEO company. That's like going to an SEO conference and asking if anyone needs SEO work done on their SEO site. 

Happy SEOing!

I'm basically looking for a way to make some extra money in my free time and pick up extra skills. I've launched one basic affiliate site thus far, there was a lot I didn't know but I decided it was important to push through and finish it for the experience. As expected, that website doesn't seem to be doing much of anything... perhaps it needs more time or some adjustments.

Anyhow, I wanted to ask about using the amazon affiliate program for niche markets. I currently use google trends and analytics, ubersuggest, and amazon's 'bestsellers' page. What are some tools you can recommend to identify profitable niche markets, or general techniques to use these tools properly? I've done a lot of reading on the subject, but now I'm struggling a bit to put everything into practice.

Niche marketing with Amazon affiliate appeals to me because it seems once you've taken the time to research and identify what products to sell, the websites are fairly simple to create and maintain (which is great for someone like me that doesn't have a lot of time to devote). Am I correct for assuming this?

(Essay inside)",BBradleys,33,10,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/18l1hw/new_to_seo_how_should_i_be_spending_my_time/,"Hi, I tried to keep this post as brief as I could but it got away from me and spiralled out of control!


I have just created my first website, QuoteGoat.com, a site for famous quotations (not exactly groundbreaking, I know) and I am trying to make a start on SEO. I'm aware that SEO is a long and complicated process which is always a work in progress, my problem is in knowing where to effectively spend my time.


Thus far my time spent on SEO has been spent:


**On site:**
Added relevant title and description tags to all pages. I had difficulty not just copying the titles and description content from the bigger sites since they clearly know what they are doing.

Added prev and next tags to paginated content. I have a large amount of paginated content (for example all quotes with the word ""love"" in (http://www.quotegoat.com/keyword/love). I have read that it is worthwhile adding prev and next tags to all the pages within these page series however this has caused google to show random pages within the series and not the first page as expected.

Created site maps for the site. The site maps came in at about 500,000 pages of which 5488 have been indexed according to webmaster tools. If I search site:www.quotegoat.com in google though I only get 112 results, any ideas what is happening here? On the blocked URLs webmaster tools page I am also being told that 4715 pages are being blocked by my robots.txt file which currently has the following in it:

User-agent: Twitterbot
Disallow:

As far as I’m aware shouldn’t be blocking anything at all. I have also submitted the exact same sitemaps to Bing, only 3 pages have been indexed and I have absolutely no idea what is causing this to happen.

Added open graph and other meta tags to single quote pages. To try and boost my social media presence (see below) I added a bunch of meta tags to single quotes pages. They work well on Facebook and I am still waiting for Twitter to get back to me about my cards application (I've been waiting a month and not even an email saying they have received my application.)


**Creating a social media presence:**
Twitter account (@QuoteGoats) - 1000 followers
Facebook page - 10 followers
Pintrest - 10 followers
Tumblr

Whilst I have had moderate success on Twitter, the majority of people following me have been follow backs and are not a high quality of Twitter user. I have not spent much time on the other platforms as I am not comfortable with how they work. Any tips on building a social media presence would be greatly appreciated. I have twitter share and Facebook like buttons on single quote pages (http://www.quotegoat.com/quote/221398) but I am beginning to think it may be worthwhile putting them on pages with more than one quote (http://www.quotegoat.com/author/Buddha). Would this be worthwhile and if so, should I have one button per page or one button per quote (which would possibly slow down the load).


**Creating unique content:**
Browsing twitter has made me aware that creating content, relevant to current events could be a good way of getting people on to the site. As such I have been experimenting with creating one off article pages. I first created an Obama inauguration quotes page following his speech (http://www.quotegoat.com/obama-inauguration), I created this the day after his inauguration and as such this page gained almost no attention.

I then went about creating a Valentine's Day picture quote gallery (http://www.quotegoat.com/valentines-day) which faired slightly better. I only got it up a couple of days before V-day which was still too late in my opinion but it proved fairly popular. I posted some of the images I created to other sites such as reddit (/r/QuotesPorn), where they did quite well (One image gained over 35k views, but was hosted on imgur).

I think that the content I am creating is good and I will definitely continue down with this avenue (especially picture quotes), however my problem is still getting people to see it which is why I resorted to paying for views...


**Paid advertisement:**
Having grown frustrated with gaining little to no views for the site via unpaid methods, I resorted to paying for traffic, first via Stumbleupon (which proved fairly useless) and then to Google Adwords. The traffic from Adwords has been encouraging, most people who have come to the site through this means have spent a good amount of time on the site and are interacting with it like I hoped. Whilst encouraging, it is also frustrating in that I do not want to be paying for this traffic, yet the only way I can get it organically is through SEO which I am having very little success with.


**Link Building**
I am aware that link building should be high on my list of priorities however I am completely clueless as to how to go about doing this. I have read that you should do a search for keywords you wish to rank highly for, eliminate your competitors and then get in contact with the remaining sites about getting linked to. If I do this I am left with almost no sites as my competitors dominate the search results.

As far as I can tell, most quote sites that rank well (BrainyQuote, QuoteGarden etc.) have been around for years and years (and look their age) and are SEO'd to the hilt. BrainyQuote in particular is incredibly well optimized, page 5 onwards on Google for the keyword ""quotes"" is almost entirely their own pages. As would be expected the majority of the quotes on my site are also on these other sites, how do you think this is viewed by Google? If it is deemed as duplicated content, most quote sites would fall foul of this as they all seem to have exactly the same quotes.

I am aware that this is getting to be more of an essay than a question so I shall conclude. The more time I spend doing SEO the more disillusioned I get that what I am doing is futile. What steps should I be taking to start effectively boosting my way up the search ladder? If you have read this far I am incredibly grateful, thank you.


**TL;DR** I have been trying to begin SEO for my site QuoteGoat.com, I have scratched the surface of a number of methods but the more time I spend doing so, the more I believe that what I am doing is wrong.

While the majority of these factors are common sense for experienced SEOs, there are a couple of really neat takeaways here. Here are my top four:

* Exact-match anchor text isn't as heavily weighted and have, in some cases and by a slight margin, a lower correlation with higher rankings than near-match anchor text. (Also applies to exact-match domains, but less so)
* Link diversity is more important than link quantity. This is more common sense, but the correlation appears stronger in this analysis than it has in the past.
* Facebook shares are the social signals that most strongly correlate with top rankings. Great reason to spend a little more time in Facebook outreach and company pages.
* Longer content tends to rank better than shorter content. This is not exact causal, per the data, but it appears that this may have been one of the signals Google used in the Panda update to penalize ""thin or low-quality content.""

I started trying to learn all I could quickly about SEO just so I knew how to pick a good person to help us drive traffic to her little shop.

Then I heard about fiverr and everything sounded great on there, so I went to town. Over the next few days I spent over a hundred bucks or so buying $5/$10/$15 gigs for ""linkwheels"", ""3-tier backlink pyramid with 5000 profiles links"", ""high quality U.S."" facebook likes and twitter followers, blog posts, etc. Just lots of little ways to get the name of the shop out there.

It was like shopping at the SEO dollar store. 

I figured that if I could get all these people doing small easy tasks (easy for them, indecipherable to me), over the next month or so she would see her beautiful shop shoot up for her long tail niche terms on Google. I thought this is how it works for people that are new and clueless, so I said shut up and take my money, fiverr community! :D

Now that I've read more and heard about penguin and ""blackhat SEO"" stuff, I wonder if I've doomed her to being blacklisted on google as spam if those ""linkwheels"" and whatnot are actually detrimental.

I'm wondering if I've done some kind of irreparable damage here. She's worked so hard on her stuff and if I've committed some google search engine sin, I'll feel like an ass.

This bad article (re-written on several [&lt;10] websites) is the only thing on the internet about the guy.

My tactics so far have been: Setup social media profiles, setup brandyourself.com, fill in all the info on any profiles I can create on major sites (LinkedIn, Twitter, Google+, etc.). Setup a page for him on about.me, all with unique original content. 

The client, unfortunately takes the Nike view that I'm able to just go off and 'Just Do It' - he doesn't understand I need to know things he's done, anything newsworthy I can write about, and that social media profiles need to be regularly updated in order to rank and be effective. We have created a website for him with a blog, but again, it needs more content (that I need info from him if I'm to write).

 I have told him if I Tweet on his behalf, anyone searching his name on Twitter will attribute whatever that Tweet says to have come from his mouth - I am not comfortable doing this. He does get searched and is a fairly important individual (I mean he's not a politician or anything, but works with some big companies). Aside from which I don't know enough about what he does to be able to Tweet on his behalf. This stuff needs to come from HIM. He is not forthcoming in email replies about any of this.

I didn't take it seriously with my job because we have a ""just keep business as usual"" mindset here. But lately since we are moving towards this new upgrade, I have been taking it seriously. He learned the term probably a month ago while in the process of looking for a new developer/designer to create a brand new eCommerce site.

After going over his site traffic with a consultant, he read a couple articles online and is suddenly a ""guru"" in understanding SEO.  And here is what he is trying to do:

* He wants me to put a giant letter to the visitor on the homepage.  The letter was meant to be a couple paragraphs, but it ended up turning into 7-8 different paragraphs all jammed pack with keywords.  He wants to put this at the bottom of the page.

* He wants to take existing words and rewrite them several times with attached keywords.  For example he wants to take ""We have the  Trek bicycles and accessories you need from helmets, leather vests, boots, and glasses."" to ""We have Trek Bicycles bikes, Trek Helmets, Trek Leather Vests, Trek Boots, and Trek glasses"".  

* And we have a list of items and prices of stuff we would be willing to buy used.  It's a giant list that is exported from excel to html that I know is not SEO friendly, and has a long page load (our current system sucks, I've been hoping to find a solution after our upgrade).  What makes it worse is that instead of reworking the list, he hired someone to take the item and price, and put it in a sentence.  For example: ""$15 paid for Trek Bicycle Red Off-Road #C4222 (Off-Road Trek #C4222 Red Bicycle) which was released in 2011""  In text in parenthesis is there because he says it's for people who search ""Trek #C4222"" instead of putting the full description.  Where did he want it placed? Directly below the giant list! arg.

Am I wrong?  Is this not poor SEO technique?  It feels like he learned this from a spam site whose gaming the SEO system. 

Can you guys give me some advice on why or why not this may be wrong?  I won't to be able to go up to him and explain SEO better, but I need your guys help in how to explain it.

Disclaimer: first decent SEO attempt, graph may be disappointing. 

[Analytics chart](http://i.imgur.com/7QrYX.png)

[KW table](http://i.imgur.com/dXikU.png)

[Overall stats](http://i.imgur.com/dsDPa.png)

So, I launched this site in DEC '11 with no thought on SEO at all. First peek was a run of google PPC with vouchers. Second one was PPC with FB vouchers.

Google PPC was full of fail this time round, FB was quite good. Very cheap and resulted in 150 targeted fans for my fan page. It was around maybe £40 in vouchers. The ad targeting on FB is A+

Its not server crunching traffic but I am pretty stoked. Its a legit business btw, not a niche site. And received the first order last month, and then another 3 more \o/. Hope this month will grow as the traffic has.

You can see where the SEO work started. I have been applying all sorts of white / very light grey tactics. Currently have about 10 LT on page 1 and my main KW has just joined the ranks at 45ish. (only optimised for it a few days ago as I have been slacking). Its not hugely competitive afaik, nor huge traffic. The main KW gets around 1.5k visits pm from google, and a good few LT's get 500+.

I got a niche on the go too, but that has only just started showing traffic from the big G. Could update on that once its a bit more established.

I have learnt a lot from r/seo and smartpassiveincome.com, that guy is awesome. 

Currently using a few tools, paid for marketsamurai which I use to decide what KW's to target, SEOmoz (once a week) as its currently free, micrositemasters for rank tracking (awesome) and UAW for link building. Few web2.0 properties that UAW points too, social bookmarking for the web2.0's etc, and I have a half decent self built article spinner I have been working on for generating UAW articles.

I will update a bit more with some of the things I have done if anyone likes, feel free to make my growth look tiny, would love to see other peoples traffic from day 0.

Edit: added a table with page views / times per KW for March only. Its mostly LT, but I think the times are good. people spending quite a bit of time on the site and viewing loads of pages. Is that good, bad, indifferent?

1301528019.0,17,self.SEO,gf3gw,Tips for SEO Consultants/Businesses,ironwill83,19,2,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/gf3gw/tips_for_seo_consultantsbusinesses/,"I've been doing SEO for about a decade now, and have worked both on the client and agency side doing it. I've had P&amp;L (profit and loss) responsibilities for the majority of this work, and have been at the Director level within larger organizations for overall online marketing as a whole for about 7 years now.

All of that being said, here are a few things that I have picked up over the years:

**Pricing**

Know how to price your business. Don't charge $15 an hour because that's what you want to make at a full-time job. Don't charge $35 an hour because it undercuts what other ""agencies"" charge and you think you can peel away clients. **SEO is a valuable service** and should be treated as such. You wouldn't go to a doctor who said he could do a liver transplant for $99.95, would you? SEO should be valued the same way as a lawyers, doctors, or other specialists time, and in some cases even more so.

So, how do you charge? There are a few points to consider. First off, think of a home improvement show. Have you ever tried to install a ceiling fan, or do your own tile, hang your own door, or anything like that? On cable shows they make it seem like it's a 15 minute - 1 hour job, then you try it yourself and you have a fucked up kitchen floor with a door that won't close right and a ceiling fan that isn't balanced.

Why? Because you aren't a professional builder, that's why!

I will gladly pay a carpenter $1 for the parts and $99 for the know-how to get it done right, and that's regardless of whether it takes them 10 minutes or 10 hours.

On a recent project for a friend I charged $1,000 for an SEO critique and help getting indexed. It took me all of 2-3 hours, or $333 - $500/hr, but I would never tell them that. They got indexed, ranked, and made a huge amount of on-page fixes for a measly $1,000, and they loved it.

That's concept one - good SEO is worth a lot of money, but it doesn't equate to hours that much.

Concept two is this: how to price when you do need an hourly rate? If you're looking to sell your services or your employees services, you need to look into a few factors, including overhead, profit margin, benefits, taxes, etc. An agency follows this approach this way:

* Take yearly salary: $50,000
* Multiply by 1.3 (30%): $65,000 - this accounts for social security taxes, benefits, time off, sick days, etc. You can also go slimmer here and do 1.2 (20%).
* Divide by 2,080: $31.25 per hour rate equivalent, with 2,080 being the number of hours in a year that you pay for.
* Multiple by **at least** 2: $62.50

You may look at that and think you're making a shit-ton of money, right? Wrong! The reality is you're not going to book an employee, or yourself, for 2,080 hours of actual work. There's time spent estimating, getting new clients, accounting, writing e-mails, and the list goes on. You can expect an employee making $31.25 per hour, billed at $62.50 per hour, to make you about a 10% profit margin, or $6.25 per hour working for you. That takes into account all of the 'overhead' I just mentioned.

**Coding**

If you don't know how to code a basic web-page, don't say you do SEO. You should hop your ass over to W3Schools.com and start learning this, because it's the backbone of our business. I can't count how many tech people I've met (programmers) that insist they do SEO friendly sites, yet when I go over their code it's absolute garbage. You should be able to speak intelligently on code, and I'm not talking about just H1 tags and title tags, I'm talking stuff like:

* URL structures
* How web services work
* How to create an internal linking structure for a site with 100k+ pages
* How a sitemap works for both normal pages and video
* How to approach CSS so that content is higher up in the code

**Playing the game**

I grew up online, so it's easy to forget that the **majority of people you meet have no fucking clue what SEO is**. People can't tell night from day between Adwords, Adsense, natural search, or what the Intertubes are. This means you need to be able to show **value** to your services.

What's the best way? With their wallet. Get information on what a customer/lead/sale is worth to them, and them show them a timeline of the value of SEO. Their initial thought process will always be how expensive it is, but you can easily show them over the course of X months/years how profitable it will be.

I'll add more to this later, gotta get some work done!

A month and a half in I ended up registering our company with google, bing, and yahoo myself.  They hadn't even started the process.

There has been no code optimization done to our site, not even a line.  

When I pressured him a bit, he pointed me towards a PPC campaign and set that up.  I went ahead with that but its not really what I hired him to do.  I mean, I'm competent enough to PAY for clicks if I wanted to.

I asked him all of this and he basically said hes focusing on link building and submitting our site to different places.  Thats fine I guess.

My questions is when should I realistically expect to see results? When do I have a  reason to look for SEO representation elsewhere?

[An example here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/hvbck/exact_match_generic_domain_still_worth_it/). 

I would like a request for comment on the act of removing the downvote buttons for comments. They will still appear on stories.

## Some caveats explained:

* **Bad answers wouldn't get downvoted** - If you think about it, the bad answers still stay at the bottom and won't get upvoted. Most bad answers I've seen (and I've not seen many) also get replied to by others who offer better advice.

* **Spam comments** - CLEARLYREBEL and myself are both very active moderators. We haven't had spam last more than a few hours on average. Comment and story spam is usually picked out by the filter. I would say about 90% of the time.

## About this RFC:

This is a call on the community to vote on what should be done. Make your opinions heard and the moderators will do what is deemed necessary.

This is a temporary solution until a larger base of users joins /r/SEO and circumvents the problem. It's hard starting out as a small subreddit.

Got a little bored doing guest posts and outreach so I created a 4 panel style rage comic about design and pointed the image credit to my affiliate money site, while adding a short text line ending with a long tail phrase linked to my site, with appropiate tagging.

The good: 
- Shit ton of likes, 6 reblogs in the first hour, 20 in the second, 60 in the first day. Then a trickle, until an ""influential"" design guy with a big following reblogged it, resulting in ~500 reblogs.
- Even on the more esoteric templates where it was reblogged, even if I can't click through, I can see my site's link in their source code.
- As the image and links propagate, I can see they are kept dofollow.
- Literally took 5 minutes to put together in paint.net

The bad:
- For ~500 reblogs GA tracked only 100 referral clicks, with a bounce rate of 75%, I'd imagine there was a disconnect between image and landing page, or just a bunch of fat finger mobile clicks. Nothing tracked to any revenue, nor did I expect it to.
- The vast majority of these tumble blogs are indexed but carry no influence, mostly bored teenagers or aspirational artsy people.
- It's my understanding the value of Tumblr links has been minimized greatly with recent algo updates.

My idea is:

Start new micro niche sites (about 10-20 to start with and may be 100 at the end) with low competition

Do different types of SEOs for them. 

See what worked and what not. 

The goal is that the website should reach google first page (top 3) with ease after SEO.

I need help in terms of people who would want to do the SEO and ideas on what can be done.

You would want to join as an SEO if you want to try it without worrying about hosting a site, buying a domain, building content and stuff.

I will be doing it anyways but if you want to join in, it will speedup the process for me and will be a hands-on experiment for you.

**UPDATE 2:** Please mention what would you do to optimize the site. Would you do one thing or more? Onsite or offsite?  

**Update 1:** Wow. I am amazed at the responses. Let me clear a few things so that there are no hard feelings going forward. I will pay for the domain, hosting and setting up a wordpress site. If you want something else, I can install that too. I will have the sites registered in my name and will retain all kind of rights to the sites after this experiment is over. However, all those who work will be able to have one permanent sitewide link on one of the websites among what they worked on.

I already have a few sites where little to no SEO has been done. Some of them are ranking high while others are not so great. I can readily start with those sites and as you guys come in we will have more sites in the works.

Please let me know (publicly or PM) what you want to do. Where do you want to start. If you want to do online SEO or offline SEO. Every one will get one site initially.

It basically said that Google [hires a certain number of quality raters who look at websites and determine whether they are high or low quality, and also how relevant they are for particular searches.](http://www.seomoz.org/blog/16-insights-into-googles-rating-guidelines) While there are a lot of sites that say that I found one particular one which said that one of the criteria that they must go by is whether or not the website provides information about who made the website. If it doesn't include that information then the site will get a lower quality ranking. 

While I can see how that is useful to weed out junk I also think that it indirectly can censor a lot of important views. I think that ultimately means that Google gives lower rankings to people who want to blog anonymously and that can include people who have a good reason to blog anonymously.

Somebody who wants to talk about sexuality or a person who is gay and doesn't want others to know are not going to want to blog under their real name. Actually somebody who wants to sound off on political issues that their employer happens to disagree with shouldn't have to avoid blogging anonymous just so that they can get a higher ranking in Google.

I wonder if Google has algorithms that can determine if a person is using a real identity by using other webpages that can verify their identity? So even if a person uses a fake name they might still get dinged by Google.

Anyways I can't find that page? Can somebody point me to a page that says that?

update:
""Website level questions play the biggest role (and you should use an overall Low or Lowest Page Quality rating) when:

The website clearly completely fails one or more of the website level checks in this document. If so, all pages on the website should be rated Low or Lowest quality. The overall rating depends on the purpose of the site and the check which revealed the quality concern. For example, all pages should be considered Lowest if the website is a store and there is absolutely no contact information, customer service information, or ownership information. For a store, this is an extremely important quality check!"" (page 107)

""Please note: if a page has low quality main content, please rate the page Low or Lowest quality. If the website that the page is on “fails” one of the website checks, please rate the page Low or Lowest quality. In other words, if any of your checks find an area of concern, do not hesitate to use Low or Lowest ratings.""  (page 105)

Contact info and who is responsible for a webpage is considered a website level check, ""The page may appear on a website which significantly “fails” the website level checks; for example, a website with absolutely no information about who created the website or how to contact the owner of the site."" (page 105)

In order to not get a low quality rating a website must pass EVERY website level check.
This quote might make it seem like having contact info is only necessary if you are a shop but the requirement to pass every website level check applies to any website. However at least with regard to this quote the quality of the page depends on the overall website so an anonymous Blogger, Tumblr, or Wordpress webpage wont get dinged necessarily but an anonymous blogger who uses their own website would get dinged as low or lowest quality.",,False,,t5_2qhbx,1354033372.0,,,True,t3_13vb2i,http://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/13vb2i/i_remember_reading_a_website_that_said_that/,

After I was done with the project I thought why not release it to the public for free as a way of saying thank you to the community. Before I do, I was just curious if this is something the community would even want to use. Essentially what I programmed was a spider tool that crawls your site and finds the following for each page and reports it back to you;

- Broken links
- Missing ALT Tags
- Missing Title Tags
- Missing Description Tags
- Most used word
- Most used pair of words
- Number of H1 - H2 tags
- Number of words
- Number of Links

Is this something that would be useful to the community? Can you see yourself using this tool when working on a SEO project? Let me know what you think and if you would like to see any other features added to this SEO tool.

If this is something you guys would be interested in I can create a user interface for it add it to one of my sites and let the community use it for free.

Let me know what you think, feedback is welcomed!


**============
UPDATE
============**


So it seems some people would be interested and others are already using existing applications like screaming frog, serpIQ, and a few others that were mentioned.  I think I will continue to move forward with the project for those who were interested.  There were a lot of great suggestions as well for new features that I will be adding to the spider.


I already was able to create a basic UI for this and will be adding it to an existing website that was started by a colleague of mine.  It will be free and also AD free (for the moment).  I currently have 2 extra dedicated servers that I will be using to host the site and run the crawls.  over the weekend I tested the crawler and was able to crawl 400 sites and generate reports for them using those 2 servers.  I will be adding daily limits to the amount of sites each user can crawl and for now I will be adding a 1,000 page limit to each site.  In the near future I should be able to raise that limit once people start using the crawler and I find areas in which I can improve the crawler's performance.


If it becomes more popular and crawls start to back up I will add more servers.  However in order to cover the cost of the additional servers I will have to put up ads =( sorry.  FYI this is just a side project of mine, I have a full time job as a web developer and I am not rich.  So my time will be limited to after work hours and weekends and my budget for servers is scarce. This is just my way of giving back to the community that has helped me.  I will let you know once it is up and ready to be used.  ETA 1-2 week...


If in the future this thing takes off and the community really enjoys using it, then I would love to spend more time and money on the project.  We shall see what happens.

- Getting people to write about their favourite product on the clients site and linking to that particular product

- Taking a product on the site that is a little quirky and writing about it  in a fun / humorous way has seen some good traffic and in turn links from social media sites.

I put this down to the honeymoon period and that we we're now on our own two feet as traffic continued to increase steadily until i realised it was most likely due to a Panda update.

Only thing is, pretty much the same drop happened on 5th March, I lost all Google traffic (90%+) and I'm not finding my site under certain keywords whilst other sites whose pages are not relevant are appearing much higher.

I'm not involved in any kind of dodgy backlinking and only promote individual posts via facebook and twitter and occasionally get a few backlinks from other website - most legit but just a few are those that ""rank websites"" (like webn#amelist.c#om minus the hashes).

I've not had any messages in GWT apart being slapped or otherwise.

The only thing I notice is that on the 5th March, google crawled a lot more pages and it's the same behaviour that occurred on 21st December.

Any suggestions on what the likely problem is, and what I should do about it, would be greatly appreciated.

Post title might not have been very clear, but let me try to explain:

I've been reading more and more about 'over-optimized' webpages getting penalized. I'm talking about keyword stuffing here.

The reason I'm asking here is because I found myself doing this, but **I have no other choice**, imo. 

My website is www.evolutionofbrands.com, where I post articles about brands and their logos. The 3 top keywords I'm ranking for right now are branding(1), logo(2) and marketing(3). 

What I'm scared for is the following: if you look at a post that has a lot of logo evolutions, for example http://www.evolutionofbrands.com/us/columbia-pictures/, you'll see that the word 'logo' is being used at least 10 times. As you can see, below every logo I post from which year it is and imo that is a must.

I know no one reading this works at Google, but could this hurt my future ranking? Does anyone have any experience with this?

One product that I had to buy purely because it's an amazing program is Scrapebox. Although, I used it in Whitehat ways. I'd be lying if I said I didn't try a few blasts, but seriously getting creative seems to work better. A quick tip is to Search for ""guest bloggers wanted"" using Scrapebox, you can get a ton of options to choice from. But my favorite trick is the following:

I use scrapebox to get Google page rank scores of massive lists really fast. What I'll do is first download a websites entire XML sitemap copy it to a notepad then upload it into scrapebox and get all the PR scores for each URL of the website. From there you can find a websites strongest pages. For huge sites, you'd be surprised what is ranking well and what isn't. I then create two sections, URL's with no value and ones with lots. I interlink the strong pages and think about either updating or getting rid of (301 direct) the weak pages.

As for websites I'm look to get a link from, well I can find high PR interpages that I wouldn't  normaly get found from Open Site Expoler or browsing. 

Don't get me wrong, I don't live and die by Google PAge Rank, but I use it as a stepping stone. SEOMoz's PA and the number of out going links are other huge factors I look for. I strongly beleive in making all the URLs on a website strong and in the correct taxonomy.

Been working on my SEO for my local business which I started about 3 months ago. I registered the domain approximately 1.5 years ago and used it as a blog at that point.  Only in the last 3 months did I completely re-design the site and have it more geared toward what my local business does, and not a general ""blog"".

Either way, I kept all the blog posts I had written over that time period, and still have them on my site. I recently noticed a spike in traffic and it looks like one of my blog posts was linked off of a forbes.com article (and thus reposted on a bunch of other related sites).

So here are my questions..

1) Will having a link from a high page rank site like forbes.com really help? I do have several other backlinks, but none from a site as big as forbes. Or does having a link from 1 site like forbes even make a difference?

2) I've been working on my local seo, and submitted my site / business to many local business directories. I've got a google places page, and replicated the same data across many places. Why when my business name is searched does the map not come up next to it?

Kind of like in this picture:
http://imgur.com/rT5XR

Does it just take time?

3) How many keywords can I realistically go after?  My business performs around 10 KEY services. Is going after 10 keywords going to hurt my changes of ranking highly? or should I be focusing on fewer?



4 ) I also have a couple of other domains that I bought about 3 years ago and ran with some friends. We are no longer actively updating the site nor selling the product we used to on those sites. The 2 sites in questions had a fair amount of back links.  THe only problem, these 2 domains have NOTHING to do with my current local business. Would it be wise to 301 redirect those domains to my new business domain? I personally don't see it as a problem, but just curious..

It was far too easy to acquire this internship (hence the reason I got it), and now I'm realizing why it was so easy...

The owner/boss is attempting to train 8 interns by himself, and he is not doing a great job. I won't fully dive into the details because I could ramble about it on-and-on. Basically, he has been teaching us the basics of SEO that many of us already know (e.g. ""What is SERP?"") and at the same exact time, he is just blowing through completely random functions of Google Analytics with shoddy explanations before bouncing to some other SEO tool that he uses that we don't even remember the name of because most of us tend to zone out when we realize that you'd have to be super human to get anything of value from what he's talking about.

I really do want to get something out of this internship besides some words to slap onto my resume; however, 1) I have no idea what I should be learning and HOW I should be learning it, and 2) I really only fully enjoy and absorb an experience when I share it with others, so how can I do that?

Additionally, he expects us all to have a ""practice website,"" which should be an actual website owned by yourself/family/friend/etc., but I don't know anyone who would actually CARE to implement the changes I would recommend...

Firstly, this subreddit is great and just what I've been looking for. 


A little background about myself, I studied music technology for most of my academic career and completed my MA over a year ago. I began distributing the software I created and whilst it's done OK, it's not enough to live on. 


Through a quirk of fate I have managed to gain the interest of a digital marketing company who currently outsource their SEO. Two weeks ago I wouldn't have been able to tell you what SEO was, and while I wasn't particularly interested in it when I began, I've definitely got the taste for it now and can see how it's an incredibly useful practice.


I've ordered a few books and have been doing plenty of reading on the web. SEOmoz' guides I've found to be particularly helpful. Essentially I want to get up to speed as soon as possible, so I can start taking on the work that is currently outsourced. I have quite a technical mind and feel that I'm learning a lot, but I wanted to get advice from people who are actively working in the area.


What advice would you give to someone in my situation? Do I work methodically through things, or just plow straight in? What things am I not going to read about in books or on the web? What tools do you recommend? And what kind of timeframe do you think it will be possible to produce work that people will pay for?   


I'm also learning Analytics as well, so perhaps there's some overlap there.

Thanks in advance :)

I run a network of websites and have just started investing a serious amount of time into learning and applying SEO. Anyhow, I came across a pretty serious issue regarding a popular plugin for WordPress called SEO Friendly Images.

The basic premise of SEO Friendly Images is that it overwrites the existing alt/title tags with some variation of the filename and post title. It saves a lot of the labor intensive elements of SEO and is recommended by Yoast (http://yoast.com/articles/wordpress-seo/#images).

However, I realized this plugin is really intended for people who run websites that are text heavy/image light AND don't feel confident in their ability to craft their own alt/title tags. The main issue is that if you have more than 3 to 4 images a page, you'll end up with almost duplicate alt/title tags and it will start to appear that you are keyword stuffing.

For instance on this post: http://all-that-is-interesting.com/incredible-photographs-new-york-city

The first image exists in the WordPress post:

&gt; &lt;img src=""http://all-that-is-interesting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/incredible-new-york-city-photographs-new-york-from-new-jersey.jpg"" alt=""New York City Skyline At Night From New Jersey"" class=""aligncenter wp-image-8826"" /&gt;

However, when it's published with SEO Friendly Images, it appears like this:

&gt; &lt;img src=""http://cdn.all-that-is-interesting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/incredible-new-york-city-photographs-new-york-from-new-jersey.jpg"" alt=""incredible new york city photographs new york from new jersey The 25 Most Incredible Photographs Of New York City"" class=""aligncenter wp-image-8826"" title=""The 25 Most Incredible Photographs Of New York City"" /&gt;

Meaning it's removed my ALT tag, stuffed the alt tag twice, and stuffed the title tag. Bad practice and even worse for SEO.

**tl;dr:** if you are capable of writing decent alt/title tags on your own and have an image heavy site, don't use SEO Friendly Images",,False,,t5_2qhbx,False,,,True,t3_1jtr4g,http://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1jtr4g/wordpress_seo_friendly_images_not_so_friendly/,

The website suicide.org comes up as a top result in Google for suicide support groups (as one might expect).  The guy running it doesn't update it, so it's got my organization's old address on there.  

So imagine you've just lost a friend or relative to suicide, and you get up the confidence to finally go to a support group.  You find one online and you go there only to find out it's not the correct location.

I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that if he doesn't update our support group info that he probably doesn't update anyone's, and this may be happening all over the country.

Here's suicide.org's whois profile: http://www.whois.com/whois/suicide.org (appears the administrator is named Kevin Caruso)

Anyway, if SEDO isn't possible, anyone have any other ideas?

EDIT: And I didn't write this in the OP, but the reason my boss gave me this task is that he's tried emailing suicide.org for months now.  And the day he came to me with it is the day after two people were an hour late to his support group because they went to the wrong address (about 2 weeks ago).

I'd just like to say, I have zero experience in SEO. I have zero experience in social media. So for the purpose of this post, please assume zero prior knowledge.
The thing is, I've been trying to break in to a career in this area for a while, this interview has popped up when I expected to not even get a look in, it's in two days, and I am terrified. I don't know a thing about SEO/social media.

That's where this post comes in. I understand if you aren't interested, but I'm desperate for help, this could be a big break for me, if any of you /SEO residents have any advice for me, or anything you can teach me about what SEO is, what it entails, what my job is likely to be as an SEO Copywriter.
If you can help, please do, it would mean a great deal. If you can't then i don't mind, it was worth a shot!


a little bit of background on me/my cv:
i only really have retail experience, which according to the agency guy is ""good"" because it's working for a retail company.
i do have some amount of copywriting experience; i've had an article published and a short story and stuff like that, but nothing spectacular!
i have a degree in english lit and a masters in creative writing. 
that is all.

thanks for any help you can give, maigod.

EDIT:
added my followup to here for visibility.
hello all, little update:
the interview was extremely informal, and the recruitment company had mislead me a little. Knowledge of SEO did not feature for this position, but a future position. This was more of a straight up copywriting gig, but i got the impression that once in the role an appreciation of SEO would help me greatly.
that said, I felt a lot more confident after getting my head around SEO, particularly the SEO for beginners book which I found to be a terrific resource.
thank you very much for your time and help, i'm a chronic worrier and having direct steps i could do to improve my knowledge helped me greatly, I also found it very interesting. SEO seems to be a progressive and ever changing field of work, it's something i would love to get involved with in the future.
thanks again, maigod

I am having a huge issues with our [website](http://www.toweb.ch). Google search reveals cloaked content (spam), yet accessing the site normally does not reveal the spam content (not even in the source).

We have setup webmaster tools, uploaded new indexes, relaunched the entire website, changed passwords, scanned the database for javascript injections and, scanned the files for malicious content. We have even contacted google, without much help.

Could it be that malicious content is not on our website, but google somehow indexes a more favorable website?

Thanks in advance for any pointers!


UPDATE: 
I found that the site has been compromised through a 777 permission setting and I found out how they got more files on it. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3328235/how-does-this-giant-regex-work.
Working on figuring out quite how they did it.

UPDATE2:
I found out that cracker gained access and installed some kind of cache that loads a ""custom"" copy of the site when the user agent contains googlebot. I'm trying to figure out what exactly it is.

UPDATE3:
I found the uploaded code. It was cleverly hidden as an image include in the index.php file. Only when I clicked that image it wasn't an image, but executable php code. I think the site may have been compromized using the 1.9.4 exploit at one time, but the server has since been modified to deny perl as a user agent. I get a 406 error try the perl script myself (courtesy of t0mmy9).

I know there are better sites with a ton more content than this one.

It starts out like most people who want to make money on the internet, looking into affiliate marketing, Adsense etc and going from there.

I've always had a massive interest in developing websites for a career, I went to university to study ICT and came out with a HND but when I graduated, the recession hit hard and I was out of work for a long time.

Fast forward to the last year or so, I was stuck in a dead end telesales job which paid shit money and was generally overall...Shit. I decided I needed out of that job and wanted to focus on doing my websites again, so I bought some cheap hosting from a friend, installed wordpress and created a few niche blogs to start making money.

I read a lot on this sub reddit about SEO and google changes etc and read up on the Begginers guide on SEOMoz.org, as I heard it was the best place for beginners to go. I did the standard SEO thing, articles link building, social media etc and traffic and money started to increase.

A few weeks down the line, I had my staff appraisal in work where I mentioned about doing SEO and websites and how I was making a bit of money from it (only a few pounds a day on adsense). So I asked the MD of the company for an opportunity to drive more traffic to the website using SEO, which he kindly agreed to. So 4 hours a week on Friday I was able to work on SEO for my company.

During those 4 hours a week, I developed a link building stratergy for the company, things like article development, releasing press releases the company already had and generally doing the standard SEO stuff that I had done to get my websites to where they were.

All was going fine, in the first month I had increased traffic by 30% and increased the refferal rate on google analytics. Suddenly I was made redundant, completely out of the blue.

I decided to put my SEO experience on my CV to see if it would grab any attention, I had one interview with a top UK SEO company who already had some big name clients, I recently had to turn down a 2nd interview for them. I also had an interview with a local magazine who were looking to increase their web presence and wanted someone on the team to do full time SEO and develop the website. 

The interviews went well, I described my experience in my previous job and how I had increased traffic to their site etc and they asked me back for a html test a a second interview, did that, it went ok...could have gone better but I was a bit rusty on my HTML.

So yeah I had the phone call to say that I had got the job and I'll be starting just before Christmas!

So I've been a Pro member on SEOmoz for about a year. I'd previously been using Raven for campaign management and basic reporting, Advanced Web Ranking for more indepth ranking reports, Market Samurai for keyword stuff... the usual tools, I guess. 

What's getting me is that not only have I not found any really actionable on any of their tools (in terms of either really good and insightful data that you can't get anywhere else, or in terms of info that clients find useful.)

I'm wondering if I'm missing the point here, or whether their tools are all rather fail, but just bundled together under Rand's suave pitch so that we all think we're getting something ""neat"", ""awesome"", etc. 

Here are some micro-rants... again, what I want to know is how useful people really find the services, and whether I'm really missing the point. 

* Linkscape: data varies wildly on each index update, every time I find myself explaining to clients that the changes recorded are a consequence of bad tools. Majestic's variation is more natural. 

* Open Site Explorer: It just shits me that they call it ""Open"" when it's a paid tool. Data is less complete than Majestic even with today's new updates 

* Rank tracker: infrequent, clunky, and all ranks checked appear to be ""as viewed"" from a US IP address (i.e. bugger all use for non-US sites and audiences)

* Mozbar: gives completely different data to what you see when you click through to OSE

* Blogscape: way superseded by Raven's Social Monitor

* Crawl: way superseded by Screaming Frog SEO Spider and most of the actionable stuff comes from Xenu

*  Campaign Manager: a clunky frontend, borky functionality

* Link Acquisition &amp; Competitive Link Finder: has anyone ever used these to find a link they wouldn't have otherwise got?

Any advice is greatly appreciated.,BeanBeans,16,4,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/jq8dz/google_distress_my_husband_told_me_to_ask_reddit/,"My husband has been semi-addicted to reddit for almost two years and he suggested that this might be a good place to ask for some advice.  About three years ago I decided to start a blog that was related to the industry I was working in.  Although I really enjoyed it, the blog was a diversion at first.  After some time, it had gained modest popularity and I had a small but loyal following.  About six months ago, I decided to re-invest some of the income into a re-design.  After some research, I decided that a self-hosted wordpress site would be best.  I wanted more control over the site and had also read that a properly configured wordpress site was great for SEO.  I hired a designer and made the move.  I was very happy with the wordpress cms and with the design, but almost immediately I took a big hit in google traffic.  I was told this was to be expected after a change.  Traffic did slowly return, but never to the levels I was accustomed to seeing.  Then on May 18, my traffic took a real dive.  The only keywords driving organic traffic to my site were basically navigation queries or people searching my site name.  After reading more SEO articles and blogs than I can count, I realized I might have been penalized by the Panda filter.  With the help of my more technically adept husband, we went through the process of trying to fix things about my site that might have a negative impact on rankings.  I can provide an exhaustive list if necessary, but they are all common suggestions from popular sources about how to “fix” your site after Panda.  My primary source of income aside from advertising is affiliates, but all of my pages have original content.  In fact, some younger sites in my niche will often have a few pictures and almost no text along with affiliate links and tons of banner ads.  They are ranking where I'm not.  Strange.  

In addition to sending me links of things he thinks are hilarious, my husband also raves about how helpful this community is, so here I am.

I'm at the point where despite limited funds (due to reduced traffic), I'm really considering hiring someone to help with this.  I'm concerned that I'll end up paying someone for an seo audit or services, and unfortunately they won't be able to improve my situation.  This feeling isn't helped by reading various accounts that people are [offering $25000 rewards](
http://www.webpronews.com/google-panda-update-one-way-furniture-reward-2011-07) to help then escape Panda penalties.  Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated.  Despite growth from other traffic sources, I feel like I just can't compete with this problem.

TL;DR – Probably need professional SEO help, afraid 'll lose money when they might not be able to fix my possible Panda problem. 
 
EDIT:  Thanks to everyone who has generously taken the time to try and help me.  A few kind people have taken a look at my site, and each had different suggestions about what might be the issue.  I was also happy to learn that there don't appear to be any glaring problems on-page.

1313613375.0,13,self.SEO,jlz8o,Clarification of basic SEO please?,lashner,16,3,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/jlz8o/clarification_of_basic_seo_please/,"I work for a small shop and most our clients are local small business. We are primarily a WordPress shop (if that matters). Lurking around here and reading what I can I think I have a pretty good base, but I have a few specific questions.

**I used a similar pattern for page titles, link titles, and image alts.**

In the past I used a very generic, but easy to read formula of

    Page Name » Site Name

Which would end up being something like

    Get a Quote » Random Company, Inc.

Lately, I've been trying to work more keywords in the title and maybe make it more natural.

    Get a [keyword] Quote from Random Company, Inc.

Questions:

* Am I on the right track?
* Do I need to stay under the 70 character limit or just make sure the important stuff is before the 70 mark?
* Is there a character limit for link titles and image alts?
* Should I even include the company name? Or would it make more sense to focus on what keywords are most important and figure if somebody is searching for the company name it will take care of itself?
* Do link title tags matter that much?
* Or is the text/image that is linked that is important?
* Should I follow the same general rules for all three?
* Should I use a different methodology if a link is going on-site or off-site?
* Should the title describe the text linked or the page it is linked to?
* Good idea to plug some keywords into the slug? (/get-keyword-quote instead of /get-quote)
* Do I need to approach link titles in menus differently than those in the copy?

So, that's about it. There are more I could come up with, but I don't want to take up too much of your time. I hope this wasn't against the rules somewhere. Figured there has to be a basic baseline to start from and I never see it explicitly laid out. It always reads very generic.

I'm just trying to do my best for my clients and feel like I'm guessing most times. Thank you.

http://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/h3zpy/has_anyone_ever_had_success_controlling_the_whole/

My efforts so far have performed decent. 

**Methods**

* I've connected through the back end APIs all of our branded social sites - for example - ""Facebook Connect"" - ""Twitter Connections""

* Added a twitter and facebook button on the main page, with alt text of ""Brand Name Twitter"" and ""Brand Name Facebook""

* I've optimized the messaging on each to mention our brand name a bit more.

* I've focused on building out microblogging sites and leading them back to our branded Twitter and Facebook

* I have made a blog post specifically about our social presence on these sites

* Submitting Twitter to WeFollow, Twellow, etc...

**Results - Just Week 2**

The top 10 results are still the same.

&gt;Site - Original Rank - Current Rank

Facebook - 11 - 11

Twitter - 23 - 15

YouTube - 21 - 16

Tumblr - Unranked - Unranked

*****

**Goal**

Get all four of these social sites in the top 10.

**Upcoming methods**

* Twitter Contest

* Facebook and Twitter widget creation

* Building out the Tumblr to be a useful site for fans. (Only 7 followers right now.)

I thought I knew all the important things to do in SEO until I hit a wall. None of my efforts are bringing any organic traffic on the website I am trying to create and grow (I am a developer).
This is the link towards my website: http://bit.ly/crxixT

I need your suggestions for what to do next. (Please don't suggest to write great content, I simply can't :))

Here is what I have done so far: (Might give some ideas to other people)


::::::::: On-page

- Submitted a sitemap to Google

- Studied what keywords I want to target (high volume / low competition, like ""find a freelancer"")

- Have keywords in &lt;title&gt; / &lt;h1&gt; / &lt;meta description / &lt;meta keywords

- Have internal links with keywords as anchor texts

- Have a lot of content

- Have keywords in urls

- Have fresh content regularly

- Created keyword targetted articles (30 or so)

- I don't have several urls pointing to the same content

- I put nofollow attribute on links like login/logout/register and other crap

- Had the domain name for more than a year to bypass sandbox

- (I should use alt attribute on my images, but I don't have that many anyway)


:::::::: Off-page

- Used keywords in anchor texts in backlinks in adequate forums and comments

- Looked at the top PR free directories and submitted there

- Submitted to crappy directories too

- Created a Squidoo Lens

- Created a Hubpage

- Created a Wordpress blog / Blogger blog / Tumblr blog / identi.ca account with tag noindex,follow

UPDATE: All blogs receive same content as website. But they are marked as noindex.

- Submitted some pages to Digg / StumbleUpon

- Subscribed to keywords in Google Alerts to find blogs where to comment

- Looked for websites that gave backlinks to my competitors

- (I haven't done any article marketing yet)

::::::::::::::::::::

What else should I do? What am I doing wrong?

Thank you everyone.

I was asked to optimize a corporate website and I don't really know how to approach to whole task. From what I've checked so far, it appears that the website needs an onsite optimization asap because Google is crawling the content in a horrible way (mixing languages, wrong descriptions). 

I have some limited knowledge in HTML and CSS, but I'm not good enough to start recording the website based on an agencies suggestions. I would therefore need a company / freelancer who is able to adjust the website's structure by themselves.

We're situated in Germany, but currently targeting the US and UK market heavily and I guess it makes sense that I research a company or freelancer with experience in those markets.

* So - how do I get started?
* Would you rather advise me to talk to a freelance who is able to make adjustments or talk to a SEO agency?
* Do freelancers have the ability to do great linkbuilding work or should I rather ask an agency for that?

I have a friend who has asked me a few times to help him with his SEO and his site. I have declined him in the past as I did not feel confident enough about my skills to take his money. However, now I have a good sense of what I am doing. 

My question to the SEO professionals, is what tools, should I acquire? What are some of the lessons you learned when transitioning to being a SEO professional? What are some of your reporting tools you use to give your clients that extra confidence boost? Any interesting thoughts for someone taking their first step as a professional into this industry?

Here are the tools I have, what am I missing?

* Google Analytics/Webmaster Tools
* Piwik
* IBP &lt;-- I know, it is mostly snake oil, bought it when I did not know better, and it is cheap to renew.
* SEM Rush
* Backlink Energizer &lt;---- Some may consider this blackhat, however like any tool it is all in how you use it
* Best Article Spinner
* Scrapebox &lt;--- Again it is how you use it, purely a research tool for me.

There are too many people spouting about “writing great content” and “getting social media buzz going” but the truth of the matter is that they’re all talking out of their arse. People in the know are too afraid to share their techniques for fear of losing their ranks or getting their site sandboxed.

Well, enough is enough. This is a tell all series. I’m going to share all my dirty little secrets – and the secrets of others. This is a no holds barred, down and dirty revelation of how SEO and online marketing really works. If you want to get traffic to your site, you’re going to have to get your hands dirty.

What nobody will ever tell you is that in order to get top ranks for your friendly local accountants firm you have to enter the dark side. White hat is great in theory, but let’s be honest: it doesn’t work. No, really, no matter what you try to do to build links to your site, you will be using a technique that isn’t approved by Google at some point or another.

The “holier than thou” Matt Cutts will talk about guidelines and best practices when in reality he is there to distract you from what’s really going on.

* A marketing manager bullshitting your way through your day – let’s face it, you don’t know what you’re doing and you’re scared shitless that someone is going to find that out. You’re desperate to learn the “secret” behind getting ranked and will happily use someone else’s money to test your theories
* A designer or programmer and you’ve been given the job of getting your company website ranked – you have no idea where to begin and you think it’s unfair you’ve been given this task
* A business owner who thinks they can do it by themselves – stop deluding yourself, you need someone who pretends to be “white hat” while using every method possible to create as little work for themselves while keeping you quiet and paying the bills

So Padiwan, let’s face facts – the web is getting bigger, you’re up against Google constantly changing the game and the only people who can succeed are those who don’t follow the rules or have massive marketing budgets.

So, if you want to witness someone having an online nervous breakdown, subscribe to /r/SEO, add me as a friend and wait for the aftermath.

Fuck.

Tactics I'm using to remove the negative links -

* Social Media Galore - Owning our branded name across all sites. Currently we do not have ANY of our social media sites appearing in the top 10

* Link Wheel for Facebook, Twitter and YouTube - So I registered variations of our branded name on wordpress, blogger, tumblr, soup.io, posterous - I'm going to try to push up our YouTube, Facebook and Twitter on these more so than the actual content on our main site.

* Creating a Wikipedia page

* Adding the business to Google Places

i'd like to ask you for a little advice:

I set up an online shop for my mothers *housewares retail store* (we 
currently only ship to germany).
I've automated quantity- &amp; price-updates which happen on a daily basis. 
(Basically a cronjob that executes a php script, which retrieves, parses 
and processes an email with an csv-attachment, ...)

There are currently over 3200 products in approximately 300 categories.
This is dauntingly massive if you consider building landing pages for
each of these or writing supportive content.
Additionaly getting good backlinks is not that easy.
I've read a lot about SEO and i've tried to act regarding whereever i
could, but i'm currently the only human resource available and 
therefore can't do it all at once.

Therefore i am looking for other ways to make an noticeable impact in
gaining more visitors, or better yet: improve conversions/sales.
As i/we couldn't spare the time to calculate proper/better prices we
currently sell all articles at the *recommended retail price*, which
sure is one bad factor for sales, i guess.

Is beeing listed in non-free-directories like yahoo or similar worth
the money?
What should i do next? What could be done with low-efforts but high-
impact? 

I (and my mom and my dad and my 2 brothers and my 2 sisters and everyone
i know and everyone you know) would be really happy if you would help me 
out with some experienced insights.

I'd like to simply throw money at this problem, but unfortunately we can't
spare much at the moment :/

In October 2010, my 90s R&amp;B site rnbhaven.com was receiving 1900 visits a day from google. Unfortunately, I got busy with my day job and so, didn't do many updates to the site. By September 2012, the traffic had fallen, but I was still receiving a consistent 400 visitors from Google everyday. By this time, I was preparing a major overhaul to the site, to try and bring it back to the glory days of 2010. However, the day before I pushed out any of the changes (my new layout was released September 30th), my site nearly disappeared from Google, receiving only 110 visitors a day from the search engine.

To put it in context, here's a break down of the three days when this ""blacklisting"" happened.

September 28, 2012 - 421 visitors from google
September 29, 2012 - 118 visitors from google
September 30, 2012 (new version released) - 106 visitors from google 

I noticed in February 2013 that I had received a number of messages from google on webmaster tools:

Messages from google - 9/25,10/1,10/3, 10/9, 10/10 with ""increase in not found errors"" and ""increase in not followed pages""

Fixing all of these issues, my rankings still haven't shown much movement.

Today, I receive roughly 78 visitors from yahoo, 62 from bing, 50 from google.

The traffic from google is basically just variations on my domain name.

Where this all gets funny to me, is it seems like Google actively tries to avoid my site. As an example:


google search for [whitney houston rnbhaven] results in archives sites holding my site, my youtube channel, amazon account, facebook page, but NOT my site


google search for [whitney houston rnbhaven.com] has me as results

Does anyone have any ideas what might be causing this blacklisting, or how I might go about correcting these issues? Another thing I suspected was that somehow my shared hosting had been poisoned, and so I moved my site over to a VPS in early April. However, this hasn't changed my rankings.

I have read the entire [SEOMoz Beginner's Guide](http://www.seomoz.org/beginners-guide-to-seo), but there are still a few basic things I haven't been able to find an answer for.

1. How do I go about doing SEO for a company (from an optimization stand point)?  Do they give me access to their site and I go mess with the code, or do I just consult and tell them what they need to do?


2. What type of code do I need to learn?  I have a pretty good grasp on HTML.  I can read, understand, and tweak CSS, but I don't have any experience writing my own CSS code.  I also have a very basic understanding of PHP. Also, how crucial is it to have wordpress experience?


3. Can you work as just an SEO (as opposed to a web designer that does SEO), and what is the best way to go about breaking into the field?  I would assume that the best way would be to try and get in with people I know that have sites, and doing optimization and link building, to show I know what I am doing.  Do most people start out freelance or start at an entry level job with a company?  How do I convince people to trust me with something as important as SEO if I don't have a lot to show as far as past work goes?

However whenever the big boys suddenly latch on to these tracks I find myself getting slammed down several pages in the search results even though I may have previously been at the top for several weeks previous.

He’s enlisted me to help get rid of this site from the search results when you type his name.

It hasn’t been updated since then and there are absolutely no inbound links to the site. My initial thought is to just Xrumer the shit out of it and send a couple thousand spammy forum profile links, etc.. with spam anchor text to try and knock it out. I know a lot of white hats out there will be against this, but I gotta do what I gotta do.

I guess I could go about making 20 different web 2.0 properties but it could be more work and take longer.

Rather than relying on a standard Google search to find a site's competitors I've been choosing popular products from the site's inventory and searching for them.

I seem to find a much wider variety of competitor sites by doing this. I keep a note of them all with catch.com or in a spreadsheet.

Once I've exhausted this avenue I then do more product searches, except with Google Images this time, which always turns up a load more sites. 

When the list has a decent amount of competitor sites I open SEO Spyglass and stick them in one-by-one. It goes and finds the relevant backlinks and checks the PR and number of links of each one. This usually takes about 20 mins. It then divides the page's PR by it's number of links to give me the 'Link Value' of each page. 

It's surprising how low the link value can often be for a PR2 or PR3 page because of the number of links. I know this is basic stuff, but seeing the value really drives it home.

I then pick the best pages and add my links. I know this isn't exactly cutting edge, but I figure it'll help someone. I'm not an SEO, nor do I plan to become one. I just run websites for the company I work for, and I find the whole thing interesting. You guys have helped me immensely, by the way, and I'm very grateful.

Seo Spyglass is about $100 but can be found for *cough* blackhatworld *cough* free.

Would be interested to get any feedback about this or any tips or techniques you guys may have. Let's all share one nugget. It's a fucking big world, after all. Ain't like we're directly competing.

**Update**: I'll usually find between 2 and 5 quality, relevant, dofollow links per competitor with a 'link value' of between 0.010 and 0.070 each. After about 4/5 hours of checking competitors for a site this afternoon I have a list of about 50 links with a combined 'link value' of 4.12.

I'm going to pepper in some URLs in the text of each post linking to outside sources. And I imagine just a couple blog posts should be enough. To keep them updated, I'll be including a contact sheet to allow others to post their links. So those related to the service that I'm using, if they find us - we'll provide a free listing for them in our ""Favorite Local Sites"" - maybe a quick blurb as well. So basically user submissions, but I'll be controlling the posting. (Since I am unsure how to implement user posts on Wordpress and Blogger - Tumblr yes.)

The other 100 will basically be landing pages with just an image, advertisement like page leading back to our site - as it sounds like too many 303 redirects could be an issue to google...

I've put up pages with some basic on page optimization (page title, h1, pictures, alt text, and so on) and they can rank on page 1 of the appropriate SERPs without more than a paragraph of text or any back links.

I've put up pages with nothing but two pictures and literally no text except for a header that can rank within the first two pages. Again, no backlinks.

These are pretty soft keywords that don't seem to require much work to get ranking + traffic.

Then, some more competitive keywords take a lot more work. Again, just some basic on page optimization is really all I do. The work comes in with building the right type of links to these pages to get them ranking.

**None of these pages have a 1000 blog post about these products.** 

My case is unique as is everyone else here. For me, all I use are really high resolution photos with appropriate titles + alt text, YouTube videos, a paragraph about the product, owners' manuals and diagrams all in PDF format, and h1 + h2 text, and page titles. It's a solid mix of content that people actually interact with and can use versus just a lengthy wall of text.

**The information that people are looking for isn't necessarily what you can write an essay about.** Sometime all people want to see is a picture of how beautiful the product's stainless steel finish is or the warm glow of lights from its face. Maybe they just need a video of how this service makes their lives more comfortable. Maybe they just ultimately need a phone number to call and talk to someone.

Of course, I do blog on the site and rank well for a decent majority of the keywords targeted with those posts. I keep the blog on topic and informative/educational about this particular industry. **But what value do I really add by writing individual articles about each and every product/service of the 100s my client's business sells?**

It would take an insane amount of time to do that.

I'm not saying writing insightful blog posts doesn't help or is a waste of time at all. But not everything on the internet deserves 1000 words extolling the incremental improvement in features and quality of product X5 over product X3.

Frankly, I'm sick of the default answer on here to everyone's SEO troubles being ""write a blog post about!"" or another gem, ""create an infographic that people can share!""

I'm sick of people taking Matt Cutts word as divine insight into how to rank well in Google. Matt Cutts is a great guy and his videos and posts about SEO are golden. **He helps everyone by trying to get us to understand how to present people with what they want.** However, take what he says with a huge grain of salt. HE'S IN CHARGE OF WEBSPAM AT GOOGLE! Is he dumb enough to give away Google's secret formula for ranking websites which generated advertising revenue of [$43.7 BILLION out of $46 BILLION in total revenue last year?](http://investor.google.com/financial/tables.html)

Total beginner here.

My question is - WP is clearly built for blogs and post-based sites, but mine is much more static.  I was not planning on using posts at all, but only static pages of information (since that's really all visitors to the site will be looking for).  Will this actively hurt my SEO?

Slowly, traffic for the site rose to about 2000 unique visitors a day. However, in the past month or so, this growth in traffic has stopped, even though I've been steadily adding new gifs. My traffic hasn't dropped or anything. It's just that there's been no real growth since, even though I've been adding gifs at a similar pace.

At the moment, I have:

* Label categories on the sidebar (I've left this as normal). There's about 15 labels in total. These labelled categories will list posts that have been tagged as such. Sometimes, posts will have multiple labels, so they'll appear in multiple ""label categories"".
* A typical archive list on the sidebar (this list is getting larger and larger as time goes on because it basically displays a link to every single post I've ever created).

What I've done so far:

I recently added ""noindex,follow"" to the monthly archive pages in order to cut down on what Google might consider as duplicate content. Basically, Blogger creates a January archive page, a February archive page, a March archive page and so on. It will then list all posts that were published during those months under the relevant monthly archive. Problem I noticed: This would lead to duplicate content and in some cases, visitors were landing on the archive pages instead of the actual posts.

Suspicions:

* I should probably add a ""noarchive,follow"" to the label category pages as well. If posts have multiple labels, it means that they're being listed in multiple categories, which means that Google might penalize me for duplicate content. For example, if I make a post and list it under 4 labels, that means that Google will come across the exact same content on 5 different pages. Surely, that's not a good thing?
* I should probably remove the archive altogether because of the ever-growing list of links on the sidebar. My fear is that as this list grows, Google is going to penalize me more and more because its basically a growing list of keywords.

I've worked in SEO for about 6 years. I started not knowing nothing about it but I worked for some pretty resourceful, mainly blackhat, internet marketers and learned a lot of stuff. I quit last year because I was tired of it and needed a break. I started as a guy who exchanged links(!) full time and ended up being the guy in charge of the regular operation and maintenance of 100+ domains.

At first I thought that I would not be getting back into this myself mainly because:

1) I always had a feeling that the day that Google will finally get the upper hand is very close.

2) With time, it only gets harder and more expensive to enter the market.

3) Putting all this time, effort and money into ""made for affiliate marketing"" sites felt like the wrong choice.


I've been thinking of coming back to this because:

1) This is what I know.

2) Being employed in this industry is not viable for me, positions like I had in my old job is not  something that you find an ad in paper for.



So my question is this (this is obviously targeted at affiliate marketers):

If you had to start from scratch today (no assets, but still had the knowledge you've accumulated over the past X years), would you do it and do you think you would have the same kind of success?  Bonus honesty question for those who answer ""yes"": is it because you think you are better than most or because you think it's just not that hard to reap rewards even today?

I wanted to make this community aware. 

Ok, so I get this call one day from a guy claiming to be from Green Pages online directory. He states that our company had an ""optimized online listing"" for 12 months that is about to expire. In my head I am thinking this guy is full of shit. I manage and track every single ad source we have. I have been doing it for 2 years. They claim that someone here authorized their company to ""optimize our site, and create a optimized listing"". The guy said that he was going to send me a bill for $760 for the past 12 months due. He went on and on about how he has sent several emails about our past due invoice. So, I asked him to verify the email address that he sent those to. Of course he could not at that time. Said he was not authorized to give out personal information over the phone. (WTF?). Like I said I have a detailed spreadsheet that I have maintained from the day I started here that lists all of our advertisers and what we pay, and the terms, etc... So, I know damn well we dont have an account with them. So, he says that ""quality control"" will give me a call to see why I want to cancel. I terminate the call and a few minutes later a woman calls by the name of Jackie Thompson. She claims that they work directly with Google. (That right there told me these people are full of shit). She said the same thing the guy said that we have a past due balance and that they have tried contacting several times. I told her to email or fax me a copy of the invoice that was authorized a year ago. She then stated that the legal department would be giving me a call since I am refusing to pay. (I have made no claim that I refuse to pay. I simply asked to see an authorized invoice). 

Edit: The phone number Jackie Thompson called from was: 718-514-9963. The phone number the guy called from was unlisted. He never gave his name, and would not give his name when I asked for it.

Hopefully you can help me. The problem is that a close friend of mine had an incident a couple of years ago. He went through a real nasty divorce which went through court and it really took it's toll on him. 

One time during the court hearings he failed to show up and the judge convicted him on contempt of court. So he got arrested and was brought to the hearing. A mugshot was taken.

Now a couple of years ago the state he resides in made all arrest records public and websites like mugshot.com started to sprout. Now when you google his name the mugshot is usually the #1 or #2 link.

I do realize he made a mistake by not showing up, but that's a different story. I have tried everything I can think of to try and make websites/profiles/blogs with his name but the mugshot site is always on Page 1 on Google. Other search engines (Yahoo and sometimes Bing) aren't a problem, they show his mugshot profile on page 2-3.

You can ask the website to remove the mugshot but it's really expensive because the site basically charges lawyer fees for it.

Do you guys have any ideas or is this a lost fight? What I'm trying to accomplish is to move the mugshot website to maybe page 2-3 on Google.

blahblahgroup.com would contain content related to the company itself, blahwidgetexperts.com would contain content related to their blah widgets, widgeteducation.com will point to content/the microsite related to their training offerings and so on.

The site (and various microsites) will all be branded exactly the same.

I'm absolutely not an SEO expert, I'm a web developer but I like to keep my ear to the ground in all things related and I've never heard of such an SEO technique. I think it's utter lunacy, personally. The guy must have spent several thousand $ on registering domain names and will have to do this yearly.

I'm going to be speaking to his SEO expert this afternoon to discuss their intentions and I'll be trying to go in with an open mind but seriously, it sounds like my client has been sold snake oil.

From what I understand, the title tag provides a great amount of weight to whatever keywords you set up.

To me, this is a waste of space.  No one is going to go to Google and search for our company's name because we are not that widely known.

I have a content heavy informational site that should, theoretically have a great ranking.

I try my best to be active in the community oriented around my subject matter, and have a fair amount of real, valuable back links, but I just can't beat the black hat guys, so I'm stumped.

Does anyone have any advice as to what else I can do to get better rankings? I'm an excellent writer, and heavily research my subject matter (I'm an ex wall street analyst and know how produce effective, pertinent content for those who want to learn), but once I get up against the guys selling their products, they've got the $$$ to pay for the link farms, etc. I'm not looking to make a ton of money from my site, but I'd like to  provide pertinent, objective information on the topic, but feel I'm pushed out of the way by those gaming the system. Should I just accept this as part and parcel for the Web? Or is there something I can do to help get my info out there?

I understand all the basics of SEO, and write properly to get attention, but I'm up against deep pockets obviously. Should I suck it up, or is there a way to get ahead in a white hat manner, and get more traffic to educate people? I post on forums, try to create high quality and pertinent back links, and spread the word where I can, all for naught it seems. I won't give up, but I'm at an impasse I feel. Any advice would be most welcome...

I'm really curious to hear what people think of the best strategy to get the links I am seeking.  What is the effectiveness of different methods? Are blog comment links better than forums? Where else can I post links? and does my on-page SEO stink?

I am trying to optimize a client's site and my instinct and research tells me that hosting a blog in a subdirectory is the way to go, that link juice will go to the domain.

The client's host though won't install the blog in a subdirectory (says they can't without further explanation). They offer the subdomain approach, changing the CNAME, and hosting it with wordpress. I don't think this is a good or valuable solution.

Does anybody have experience with this? Is it worth it to host on a subdomain?

EDIT: This is what I am gathering (and feel free to contradict me because I'm new to SEO). If I want this blog just to build link juice (get some backlinks and get more pages indexed) it is best to go with a subfolder so that all the link juice goes to my main domain. If the blog was for status updates (like a blog on a major e-commerce site) then it would make sense to have separate hosting in case the main site is down. The blog I want to add is not for this purpose. It does not have to be the ""voice"" of the company. This is purely to get more link juice.

Therefore: subfolder is the only thing that makes sense. Even if I create a subdomain and then link to the main domain from there, all the links will be coming from one subdomain which will probably not have high PR anyway. Creating a blog on a subdomain therefore seems like a waste of time and effort.

We are not doing anything shady and have stuck to the white hat SEO stuff only.

What frustrates me is that the site is STILL a page ranked 0 site. I know PR is not the end all and be all but I think this is hurting him in his local SRPs.

It took us a week or so to realise as it was a javascript error and not visible to a user. Everything has since been fixed and marked off in GWT, and a few backlinks added, though Google still gives us no love. This happened way back in December of last year.

I was asked to do some SEO for a local Photobooth company where they bring their booth to weddings, restaurants, or parties and the guests take pictures in them. They're wanting to increase their online presence, but I am contemplating how to do so. 


Their site is quite new, so it hasn't been crawled by Google yet, but when it does I assume it won't be ranked very well considering the high competition for both Photobooth and Photobooth + city keywords. I'm curious of the best way to approach this. We have tried Adwords and it actually did bring in some leads so I'm wondering if sticking to this is best since competition is so high. 


I've only ranked for very low competition keywords, so I have little hope that I'll be able to rank for this one at all. Rather than waste much time on it and get nowhere, would it be, in your opinion, better to work with Adwords and try to increase conversions through that? Or maybe some combination of both?

1362163938.0,9,self.SEO,19h6k5,Looking for advice on what to do next (SEO).  And possibly what I'm doing wrong.  This is a local non-profit.,krashx6,16,7,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/19h6k5/looking_for_advice_on_what_to_do_next_seo_and/,"Like many people who post here, i'm no SEO expert, and read /r/SEO and the SEOMOZ blog daily to figure out what to do next to help my business succeed.  I've gotten many great tips from here that have really helped me build out the companies website, but whenever I check Google Analytics or Google Places Analytics, I see almost no improvement. 


The company is a small non-profit in central Florida of health care clinics; www.chcfl.org is our site.  The site was originally built by an outside marketing company who did no SEO work and I've been put in place to manage the site, do SEO work, build out our social media platforms and ultimately get us more patients.


So far I've...


-Added or claimed all of our locations (9) on the top mapping and local search sites; Yelp, Mapquest, Yahoo Local, Google Places, Bing Places, Localeeze, Infogroup.  With most of these site's i've tried to add as much information to each individual locations page without keyword stuffing.  Mainly trying to keep consistency of the business across the whole internet

-Removed a few incorrect listing on google maps that had our old phone #'s

-Setup our facebook, twitter, google+, pintrist and linkedin and actively post 5-10 posts on the more popular ones a week to draw in customers.  (facebook.com/chcfl.org)

-Installed SEO Yoast and went through a few pages on our website, setting meta tags, description and titles.

-Redesigned a few pages on our website that were getting the most traffic to include more useful content and photos. 

-Sorted through a lot of the images on our site, adding Title and Alt tags.


Thats about all I can think of at the moment, but i've seen no real increase in hits to the site, and its been hovering around 8,000 hits a month for the past 6 months.  Most of these changes were done in the past two months.  We've met with a few marketing companies the past few weeks that swear they can get us drastic increase in site traffic but we're a non-profit and cant really afford to use a marketing company.


Can I get some opinions or advice on what im doing wrong?  What needs to be fixed or shouldn't exist at all?  I know &lt;h1&gt; tags need work and a few pages on our site are in drastic need of content.  I also think that our Google Places listings are probably getting down ranked for keyword stuffing, but im not sure.  All our centers titles are &lt;Company Name&gt; - &lt;Location&gt; &lt;Services Covered&gt; (Heres one: http://goo.gl/maps/yFQbt).  From what I read it should just be &lt;Company Name&gt; for the title and thats it, but we dont offer the same services at each location so I was requested to name them like this.


On our location pages, the site was originally setup to display the &lt;H1&gt; at the top like ""Location: Eatonville"" (ex: http://prntscr.com/umkas) but when I use the sites that scan for H1 tags, these never come up, so I believe this is something I need to fix, BUT are these even good H1 tags?  Should it just be ""Eatonville""?  We're mainly trying to get traffic to each locations individual page so patients can see that community clinics for medicaid and medicare patients arnt always ugly and using old equipment.

 but some of it made sense to me. It seems like the "" if you build it, they will come"" syndrome. And I realize there will stlil be companies who need SEO or marketing peeps to actually DO the content writing, etc.  but part of it made sense.

Notes: It is ok if users know of the other sites but they don’t need to and I have no interest in cross-promoting the businesses to eachother. I am not concerned with author rank. 

tl;dr – I have several unique websites and it is time for me to set up google authorship. Should I use unique G+ accounts for each domain or bite the bullet and use one account for everything? Also does anyone know of a pro/con for using a Google+ authorship account from their own domain vs a gmail account? 

Edit: Since posting I read about owners and managers of Google+ pages: ""the names of the owner and managers aren’t visible to the public or to those in the page’s circles."" [source](https://support.google.com/plus/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=2380625). As for the page creation I'll manage that all from one acct..

1336597095.0,8,self.SEO,tfb5d,A bit of advice starting an SEO digital marketing internship and the first week is not what I expected....,thrillho111,8,0,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/tfb5d/a_bit_of_advice_starting_an_seo_digital_marketing/,"So after graduating from university and taking care of an ill family member for most of the last year, I am finally starting an internship at an SEO company that helps small businesses get an online presence and increase their traffic. I have been really excited as I have had some experience using social media as an administrator for a university society, and in my free time use it to discuss pro-wrestling and other entertainment (I would like to think I use it more and a larger set of social media networks than the average person). I also managed to write a bit about the topic for a paper while studying. Anyway, while looking after this family member and having a previous bad experience in my first job of publishing, I decided to try and make this a career and do something that has given me a lot of pleasure in my leisure time. 

So I started the internship last week. I've been slowly learning basics on my own up to now, reading Google's guide on SEO, listening to several podcasts (though I still have a lot to get through) etc. I still have things to learn, such as basic computer tech stuff like HTML but I'm getting their slowly as I can see it is quite a bit essential especially when looking at websites and advising what can be changed (I'm able to pick up things from just appearance at the moment). I studied English and Media, so I do not have a computing background (so any advice on things to read or look at to get me up to speed at a level that is at least satisfactory would be of much help). 

Anyway, in my first few days I was a bit alarmed that my boss was asking me to edit fake FB profiles to change a previous student to appear as a mature woman for the purposes of spamming. I have also been asked to use WordPress to edit a site about cash loans, which have a lot of anchor text links to cash loan providers within the articles and for tags. My boss also has a Twitter account under a different name and admitted that one of her clients thinks this is her real name. From my brief reading and basic common sense, I can tell that this isn't right and I understand that it is a slow and steady process to get results for anyone in SEO and social media.

My boss seems a bit flighty and while planning a wedding, is also taking on a few other additional projects. There are quite a lot of things that she said she intends to go through with me and she has begun doing that (like using Squidoo and Hubpages). My boss has also said she will go through Google services like Adwords and Adsense though I have done my own reading into this to prepare.

The internship goes on till the end of July so I'm confident that I still have ages to learn new things and it HAS only been the first week and a bit. I'm not getting coffee or doing many of the usual remedial tasks that an internship usually consists of, which is a plus. It is also only 4 days a week so I'm picking up some part-time work on the side.

I'm not sure what the point of this post is. I think partly to ask for advice or ask if there is something I should watch out for. Has anyone else had previous bad experience within companies who are not exactly using White Hat strategies or are kosher? Also is there anything I ought to be reading/listening to as far as starting out and keeping updated in the world of SEO and social media? I already listening to SEO 101 and SEO Advisor while I work so I am making the most of my day. I've already made up my mind that, once I get involved in actual projects for the company, that if I am asked to do something Black Hat or something that makes me feel uncomfortable, I'll make it known that I do as I don't want to be pressured into doing something that will come back to me and I'll be blamed for.

Anything I should be listening to/reading?
Anything to cover the detailed techy stuff such as HTML to get me to an OK level.
Should I be worried or is this just another case of starting out in an industry and ""paying dues""?
Anything I should watch out for?
Am I asking the right questions or is there anything I've missed?

This post is a bit all over the place I know; I guess I just have quite a bit on my mind at the moment.
Thanks in advance

UPDATE: Just a quick note to say thanks to everyone who replied or commented, and more so if you also provided recommendations for things to listen to or read. It was really helpful to listen to your own experiences. I actually had a really good day today, and I'm looking on the bright side that I have 10 weeks left and lots to learn whether through my boss or individually. I think when I created this I was having a rough day and needed a vent, and you've all responded very kindly. I'm in no means a bad situation compared to some things that are posted on Reddit daily so all is good. I'm actually going to return to a WordPress site I created in February on pro-wrestling (I'm a big fan) and use what I'm learning as I go along and apply it there, which is a pursuit which will seem actually feel fun and be productive.

Now, everyone has a website, but they're not doing anything with them. Without SEO, they are just lonely islands, wasting server space.

Trouble is, we don't get what we used to due our being tied to the construction/real estate market.  

Many people were laid off and the guy that set up the Google Adwords turned it over to me before he quit. I have been reading books, watching video and generally working to understand so I can hopefully help the business succeed. I looked at what the previous guy had done and he had 7 campaigns running for different product lines and the largest was running 97 different ads. We were spending ~$5000/month and that was cut, as the revenue isn't there to pay nearly that much anymore. Sadly, I think that we had an idiot running the Adwords, but the owners aren't tech savvy by a long shot. But I digress.  

I have watched the free StomperNet videos, I have read more blogs and websites on SEO/SEM in the last week than you can imagine.  I have learned about backlinks, tools, blackhat/whitehat techniques etc. I can't say I understand everything, but I can say that I am desperate to try to use the *much smaller* ad budget to get more people to the site, which directly correlates to people in the door and conversions.

If things don't turn around, they will close the business. Who do I listen to? I just want to have a much more effective Adwords campaign to get more feet through the door. Before, business was SO good, no one noticed the inefficiency of the previous guy.  Now I said I'd take this on and my co-workers are counting on me to get this in order to boost sales and keep our jobs.

Our company has used Elance and Vworker to do work for us, but I found when they did anything, if you didn't understand what you wanted, you obviously didn't get it. If I wanted to use them for SEO, I am too ignorant of SEO/SEM to know what I am asking for specifically. I can't just say give me customers. We get 5 calls a week from local SEO companies that want more than our ad budget to help us, so that just isn't an option.

Here's the data:
I've worked with two different websites that have, at different times (one pre Penguin 1 and one just after Penguin 2) received notices from webmaster tools for links (the ""light"" warning, not the ""bad"" one, if you know what I mean).

The first (pre-penguin 1) received a notice and then we noticed that all the sites for their major keyword (a keyword which is competitive in their niche but not overall extremely competitive) shifted around in the SERPs, raising and falling. At the same time they noticed that their paid search budget (for the same keyword) wasn't giving them the same results it once did (the big price going up for that phrase).

The second (post-pengun 2) received a notice and all the serps for their major keyword shifted (this keyword is much more competitive and filled with some pretty aggressive spammers). One of their closest competitors in particular fell very fast. According to Majestic's data that competitor in particular was removing links like mad (losing 4000 in a week) which suggests that they were ""renting"" those links (not only because they could remove them so quickly but because it was one of those circumstances where you ask your self, ""how did they get this link?"" and the only reasonable answer was, ""they must have bought it""). Removing links suggests, to me, that they might have gotten a notice as well.

Here's my theory: 
When Google sends a notice to a website for unnatural links it not only checks that sites backlinks but determines their most important keywords. It then puts the whole serps for that keyword under scrutiny. Not only does this mean other sites might also receive notices (hence the shakeup in the serps I noticed each time) but also increases the money Google can make from Adwords (as companies attempt to buy traffic to make up the difference they lose from organic search).

Now we know Google's motto is ""do no evil (to your investors)"" so anti-spam efforts to raise revenue from Adwords makes sense and is an obvious move for them. At the same time tt seems to me that a great way for Google to catch spammers is to attack areas for which they are focusing on. It's a way for them to stop the ""arms race"" that sometimes happens in the serps- one person spams and dominates so everyone else has to be more aggressive to compete.

So what tools have you used? How do they work? Would you recommend one? I've heard of BrightLocal and Yext but I'm apprehensive about the automated process and possibly creating duplicate listings on accident.

Secondly, on the paid tools that have monthly packages, is it possible to sign up for one month, push all your listings, then cancel the service? If I have it properly tracked in analytics then I don't need any of their dashboard tools.

If you *don't* recommend paid tools, then which directories are absolute musts for local citation &amp; link building?

Thirdly, I want to get your recommendations on the links. Our site has a locations overview page and then individual pages for each location. The older campaigns I listed above have tracking codes attached to them, so the URLs are kind of messy. Is that even wroth doing? I'm talking about tpcustom and utm tracking codes. Should I just be linking every single one to the locations page with no bullshit attached or does it matter?",,False,,t5_2qhbx,1367437649.0,,,True,t3_1di1y5,http://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1di1y5/local_listings_and_business_directory_syndication/,
1367015954.0,6,self.SEO,1d6mib,Website upgrade with domain name change took a huge SEO hit. Could use a bit of advice.,mattisbones,9,3,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1d6mib/website_upgrade_with_domain_name_change_took_a/,"Hi all (sorry for the wall of text).

A friend of mine's family owns an e-commerce site, and have been operating that site on an old domain name for maybe 15 years or so. They were looking to upgrade their website, and I was busy at the time, so they went with an outside party for development. 

About half a year ago, the new website launched, and these new people switched the primary domain name from http://examplecompany.net (registered in 1999) to http://what-they-sell.com (registered in 2012), with hyphens and everything. They also did not set the proper redirects from old web pages to new ones.

So the SEO has taken a pretty massive hit, and isn't really gaining much traction, even though the site is structured better for SEO, and they are working on backlinks.

* How bad would it be, at this point, to switch back to the original domain name?
* Is putting the redirects from old pages to new a futile exercise at this point? (I still plan on doing that though, if possible)
* Is there anything else that can be done to help restore the old SEO rankings?

Thank you.

I am looking for a new job, and really struggling to figure out how much money to ask for. I keep accidentally low balling people, as near as I can tell.

I have about 2 and a half years of experience working at a full service pr and marketing firm. I have done a little bit of everything, on page seo, adwords, ad center (now bing ads), Facebook ads, social media for consumer brands more generally, seo auditing, and I've coordinated a bunch of website builds, doing initial keyword research and writing copy, titles h1 tags, etc. My experience is very eclectic and I have no idea how much money to ask for.

So basically most of the jobs I'm getting interviews for are for paid search, which frankly is fine by me since it is the area I know the most about. Is there a way to tell how much I should be asking for. Especially for those positions. For instance, is there any kind of rule of thumb that says ""for every million bucks in adds you ask for $Xk.""

Premise:

I make websites and know enough about on-page SEO to do a pretty good job of it.  I don't do link building but I do encourage my clients to purchase this from another source and then manage the 3rd party for them.  That might seem like an odd choice but I don’t really want to get involved with SEO, my passion is coding, it’s just so important that I’m forced to.
One of my clients is paying nearly a grand a moth for link building and so far he's got very few links (albeit on very targeted sites for his industry) with very little page rank.  By very little I mean from 0 to 2.  

Questions:

How important is page rank nowadays?  I know it used to be the be-all-and-end-all.  They’ve been working on the site for 4 months now and last month I had a total of only 7 links!  I’m due to speak with them tomorrow about their performance and want to know if I should start to kick ass.

What should I be aiming for from them?  I had assumed that we would accumulate at least some links from pages with a ranking of at least 4.  Is this even the correct thing to ask for?

However, we need your help to deploy to a larger user base in order to test usage on a wider scale. I would like to humbly ask you guys and girls to signup as a beta tester over at our official page: http://mokefi.com (you should be good as long as you have an iOS device. Android is coming soon!)

The site also offers a little video of the app in action, showcasing some of the features, I urge you to watch it to get a feel for what we are trying to do. Keep in mind that we are still working on a lot of stuff and will probably add a lot more in the future.

Finally, I thank you all for your time and encouraging words. Suggestions, criticism and anything else are always welcome. Feel free to PM me and I'll get back to you as soon as possible.

just looking for some input here. Long story short, I'm pretty much addicted to keyword research, constantly fiddling around with the G keyword research tool, checking market samurai and so on (I'm sure I'm not the only one). 

Now, what I personally find missing is a solid little keyword research app for the iPhone (or Android). Ones I've come across were either 

a) poorly executed
b) non-working (or stopped working shortly after purchase)
c) lacking in functionality
d) trying to compete with a full fledged desktop tool

All of the above got me a little frustrated so I decided to build my own tool. So I've got working with Xcode and around 70%-75% of all functions are pretty solid right now.

I've uploaded some screenshots of the interface, it's pretty simple, but to be honest thats exactly what I wanted. Something slim, fast and fun. Here's the album: http://imgur.com/a/zmmQa#0

Initially, I wasn't really interested in selling the app (for one, I'm really not too keen on dealing with you know who's approval guidelines), however I've been getting some encouraging comments from a number of colleagues...

Does anybody have experience with selling internet marketing related apps on the appstore/android market? I've only ever done some contractual app development, so subsequent promotion of the final product wasn't really my concern, hence I have very little experience with the actual sales/marketing process... Is it generally a tough game? Does anybody have some tips that might help me climb the appstore charts (if even a little)?

Finally, does apple allow keyword optimized app pages :)

Thanks for the input guys!

* Host it as a page of our website with a link to our homepage at the bottom. My concerns with this is people will get the initial impression they are being sold something because the frame of the site contains shopping navigation. 
* Simply submit it to infographic aggregators, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit. Tumblr and hope we get traffic from the signature at the bottom.

Background: I have different keywords I can target for my site. An example of a few are: k53, learners, licence, test. 

The problem I'm having: I'm trying to target longtail keywords, but I'm unsure how Google 'realises' when something counts as a longtail keyword. The 4 words I mentioned above can be combined in many different ways to form different and useful longtail keywords (K53 Learners Licence Test, K53 Test, K53 Learners Licence, Learners Licence, K53 Learners Test etc). 

Google Adwords' Keyword tool has shown me which terms are most searched for locally, so I want to target those longtail keywords, but often I have to use them next to each other - for example, ""K53"" on its own is a good term, as is ""learners licence test"", so if I'm writing ""K53 learners licence test"", is Google thinking that 4 word phrase is my entire longtail keyword? Does it break it up? At what point does it cut off and say ""Okay, *this* is the longtail keyword, this next bit is just another relevant keyword"".?",,False,,t5_2qhbx,False,,,True,t3_tbgrf,http://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/tbgrf/how_does_google_differentiate_between_a_longtail/,

I check the SERPs, and I'm ranked #5 for one of my keywords on Yahoo. 

So, I want to know how I can improve on this. Any advice?

**Edit: Update-**
I decided to google that shit. Yeah, yeah- I probably should have started there, but then we wouldn't be having this wonderful discussion, now would we ;)

I found that SEO for yahoo is pretty similar to goog, BUT yahoo places a stronger emphasis on site design than others (coding, not the images), and they have  a shorter penalty box time for new sites (around 6 months). I forget the exact details, but what I do recall is that the closer your content is to the top of the crawl, the better.

META keywords have been mentioned here, and I am using meta keywords, but sparingly, as the site has a narrow scope, and I am more interested in quality of traffic than quantity. No point in bogging down the server with non-income-generating traffic.  


My keyword is not very competitive, or I wouldn't have gone for it in the first place. Despite that, I find it amusing that I was able to hit first page in under a month with minimal SEO- maybe a handful of links thrown at it. The word I'm ranking for is my main keyword, which is kinda nice. 

As someone else mentioned- not much traffic from Yahoo... and seeing as SEO for yahoo is not much different than Google, I'd say just concentrate on Google and if you happen to rank on other engines, consider it a bonus.",,False,,t5_2qhbx,1376592547.0,,,True,t3_1keh2x,http://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1keh2x/how_do_you_do_seo_for_yahoo_and_how_do_you_check/,
