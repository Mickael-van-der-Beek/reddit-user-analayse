## Five steps to DRM activism

1. Go to http://dayagainstdrm.org and pledge to take action.
2. Send the link to all your friends on your social networks.
3. Go to the [LibrePlanet wiki page and list an event you'd like to run](http://libreplanet.org/wiki/Group:DefectiveByDesign/Day_Against_DRM_2012#Events) (see below for ideas)
4. Email us at the FSF -- campaigns@fsf.org -- an address (in the US and Canada for sure, overseas we'll do our best to get something out)
5. Plan your event on campus or in your local area, FSF materials will be sent ASAP.

## Some ideas for events

* Have a pizza party in your dorm room -- ask people to make their pledge on the http://dayagainstdrm.org website to sign up.

* Throw a frisbee around for an hour. Afterwards, drink and talk about DRM.

* Ask your school's library to sign a pledge against DRM-ebooks and DRM-textbooks.

* Post copies of [The Right to Read](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/right-to-read.html) all over school. 

* Hand out anti-DRM stickers, offer them to fellow students who make the pledge.

* Wear your anti-DRM buttons with pride, put them on your bag, and talk to your class about DRM.",,False,,t5_49zi,True,,,True,t3_sijv8,http://www.reddit.com/r/freeculture/comments/sijv8/calling_all_students_have_an_drmevent_at_your/,

The Free Software Foundation has, since 1985, fought for digital freedom in many different ways. As the battles they fight grow more diverse, they are casting about for new supporters.

Please, consider following the link above and giving 10 dollars a month this year to help fund battles against UEFI secure boot, programs supporting the use of Ogg Vorbis, and legal action against GPL violators. Help these great people do their jobs, so that we can move forward in the battle for digital freedom.

I recently wrote to you about the aftermath of SOPA (see [my blog post](http://blog.marktraceur.info/blog/2012/after-SOPA.html)), and how it related to free software and free culture. Since the FSF is tied (loosely) to organizations like the Blender Foundation and Libre.fm, the support you give will go towards saving those free services and others that could very well put the nail in the entertainment lobby's coffin.

&gt; The mission of the Free Culture Foundation is to bring an end to the subjugation enabled by private ownership over media, ideas, and technology.

Our own sidebar begins with

&gt; The free culture movement is a social movement opposing the privatization of technology, information, and creativity.

There's an unfortunate tone here that I've noticed in a lot of free culture references, the focus is on the bad of today's world.  I don't support free culture out of hatred for the non-free, I support it because I think it will make for a better world.  Are there problems with the status-quo?  Sure.  But focusing on those, rather than simply the cultural benefits of freeing one's work, is much less likely to attract people to the philosophy.  I used to provide people with the freedomdefined.org link for exactly this reason, but it seems to be down now (edit:  it's back up).

I assume I'm not alone here in distrusting Google. Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, the whole lot of them. I do have a gmail account, and I use it for a lot of things, including calendar, contacts, and syncing.

So I'd like to throw this out there... What are some good alternatives? If you search for ""gmail alternatives"" most of the alternatives people recommend are just as bad or worse. Trading gmail for hotmail hardly lets you escape the root of the problem, which is that my email provider and I have divergent interests. I feel better just paying outright for a service, or using a non-profit I'm a member of, for email. Ideally, email with a web-based calendar, CardDav server, and other niceties that let me run my life.

If you search for paid email hosting, most companies doing that sell primarily to businesses. For example Rackspace Mail looked interesting, until I read about the minimum order requirements.

What does r/freeculture recommend? And do you have any good services that also provide CalDav and CardDav services, preferably with web-based interfaces?

Some options I'm already aware of:

* Lavabit.com: Seems great. Unfortunately, I emailed them about setting up my domain with them, and never heard back. There doesn't seem to be any self-serve option. Also no calendar/contact syncing.
* PoBox.com: Good, though the only calendar/contact syncing is through Atmail, which seems buggy to me. Also, they recently had some high-profile downtime.
* Hushmail: Another fine option, though they've apparently oversold their encryption abilities. Also no calendar/contact syncing.

Recommendations? Or thoughts in general about trusting services like Google with running one's personal life?",,False,,t5_49zi,False,,,True,t3_1bmcjn,http://www.reddit.com/r/freeculture/comments/1bmcjn/on_personal_email_accounts/,

Here's the [back story](http://neuroconscience.com/2013/01/13/researchers-begin-posting-article-pdfs-to-twitter-in-pdftribute-to-aaron-swartz/) about #pdftribute. Basically, people in the academic community are posting links to pdfs of their research articles to twitter under the hashtag #pdftribute, in tribute to [Aaron Swartz](http://boingboing.net/2013/01/12/rip-aaron-swartz.html). [pdftribute.net](http://pdftribute.net/) is a twitter link scraper that aggregates all links posted with the #pdftribute hashtag.

The problem with pdftribute.net is that many of the links on the site are not direct links to pdfs but are instead links to other sites that host the pdfs (or links to news articles, etc.). Here's where [my perl script](http://slexy.org/view/s2U4MaQNMN) comes in. As the title of this post states, the script that I wrote crawls links from pdftribute.net and outputs all the direct pdf links it finds. It's a bit crude, and it probably only works on *nix systems, but it does work. Once you have the list of pdf links, you can download all the pdfs using wget or curl.

Maybe someone with a knowledge of torrents and decent bandwidth could download all of these pdfs and create a torrent of them. *That* would be a fitting tribute.

P.S.

I ran the script for 10 or 20 minutes, and [this](http://slexy.org/view/s21534qFM5) is a list of all the pdf links found in that time. If you run the script for longer, I'm sure there are many more to find.

Are there any other speakers for free software and/or free culture that would make good nominees? Perhaps one of the pirate bay folks would be interesting to hear from

Anyways, here's my nomination for Eben Moglen and the link to make a nomination:
[http://www.ted.com/nominate/speaker](http://www.ted.com/nominate/speaker)

Tell us briefly about the speaker: Occupation? Honors or distinctions? Recent work? Why are you recommending them?

Eben Moglen is a professor of law and legal history at Columbia University, and is the founder, Director-Counsel and Chairman of Software Freedom Law Center, whose client list includes numerous pro bono clients, such as the Free Software Foundation.

I'm recommending him to speak about free software and its increasing importance.

Have you heard this person speak publicly? If so, where?

Yes, at LibrePlanet 2010 giving a talk, The State of Free Software.

If yes, please describe this person's speaking style.

One of the very few people, like Lawrence Lessig (two time TED speaker), who are able to make issues concerning intellectual property understandable to common people.

Please provide links to any articles or web pages about the speaker.

* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eben_Moglen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eben_Moglen)
* [http://emoglen.law.columbia.edu/](http://emoglen.law.columbia.edu/)
* [http://emoglen.law.columbia.edu/resume.html](http://emoglen.law.columbia.edu/resume.html)

Please provide links to any online audio or video featuring the proposed speaker.

These talks available on YouTube tend to be aimed at a more technical
audience, but he is a moving speaker and can talk to a general crowd
just as well.

People's choices in social media platforms do not value ""freedom"" the way our movement tends to think of it. The top priority is in the exchange of information. Information is valuable in its transience, not its secure and private storage. This means that viewership and design are essential. How can privacy-respecting free software social media services compete in this kind of environment? 

So why do we put so much responsibility on individual users? As a movement, we challenge oppressive power structures in media and computing, which requires individual support, but we must always target those dominating entities. How do we act beyond boycotting proprietary software and cultural works, to strategically topple these media and technology monopolies? 

We can no longer afford to be an isolated, inward-facing movement. It's time to leave our legacy of liberalism behind us and form coalitions with groups opposing ableism, colonialism, imperialism, prisons, racial/gender/sexual violence, class oppression, etc. How do we broaden our understanding of the relationship between technology and other issues of oppression and modify our messaging around that?

This is a continuation of a previous discussion:

And the Dalai Lama isn't as absurd an idea as it may sound, he's a very cultured person with a deep love of science; he's even gone so far as to publicly 'ask science' how it suggests they modify his religion!  The basis of his ideology is very similar to that of FLOS; thinking about things and sharing knowledge is good, helping the community is a great thing to do, life is about more than just the moneys.  
  
Even a few links on his twitter to important projects like OpenSourceEcology, SolarFire, Creative Commons, etc would be a huge boost, a lot of people outside the 'tech circle' would start hearing about and being interested in these traditionally nerd-only things, plus if someone like him talks about it then it's much harder for the press to ignore.
  
and who knows, he might even speak to some of his famous pals and make it cool to support FLOS - maybe the dedication they put into the mandala will one day find itself mirrored in their bugsquishing work?! [oh no wai- um, software-harmony-organization-and-problem-solving, definitely not squishing bugs....]  
  
So yeah, anyone know anything about his stance on anything related? or a good way of getting his attention, i'd love to do a pilgrimage through the foothills carrying a ubuntu dvd but i don't think he's in tibet any more :( also it's probably a massive tourist trap these days...

I'm going to be a coauthor on a scientific paper. One part of my contributions to this paper was writing some code for image/data analysis and visualization. I plan to include the code in the supporting information (which is freely accessible), however as it is customary (and necessary) to do a copyright transfer (to the publisher) for the text. I do not want the code to become ""copyright of publisher XYZ"", so I plan to include it under a license embedded in the code. 


**Q1.** Does this sound reasonable and/or workable? 

**Q2.** What license should I use? OR What are my options? (I want others to be free to reuse, modify, and pretty much do whatever they want with the code... I just don't want it to become the publisher's property.)

**Q3.** Would I be better off just putting in a line offering to supply the code to any interested party? (The downside here is that it could potentially be less accessible to others; including it in the supporting information essentially provides archival access with a group that's been around for 135 years.)

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/

&gt;When you upload or otherwise submit content to our Services, you give Google (and those we work with) a worldwide license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works (such as those resulting from translations, adaptations or other changes we make so that your content works better with our Services), communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute such content. The rights you grant in this license are for the limited purpose of operating, promoting, and improving our Services, and to develop new ones. This license continues even if you stop using our Services (for example, for a business listing you have added to Google Maps). Some Services may offer you ways to access and remove content that has been provided to that Service. Also, in some of our Services, there are terms or settings that narrow the scope of our use of the content submitted in those Services. Make sure you have the necessary rights to grant us this license for any content that you submit to our Services. 


I've asked the Glass team via twitter if this will apply to personal media acquired directly from our eyeballs using glasses (Google Glass).  No reply yet.

As personal commentary - this is the industry standard policy for all online/media based companies - basically it says if you let us have it, we get to do with it what we want.  Part of the is value creation for them - there's a TROVE of value in media about people, and also it's about risk mitigation, it eliminates the risk the company will run afoul of the user or the law for how it uses media people give it.

That said, we're crossing a real line with mobile devices and personal, wearable devices that record and upload content.  Personally, (my opinion here) it's not reasonable to use a device to record or access personal elements of my life if a multi-billion dollar profit-only-motivated enterprise get a perpetual worldwide license to do whatever it wants with that data.  It's arguably ""my"" data, not theirs to whatever extent we have the idea of property that can apply to data.

The developer (lovinglinux) is still reading and posting in this forum thread as of April 2012: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1487327

FlashVideoReplacer is a fully free browser plug-in that lets you stream or download videos. Web video, like on YouTube, vimeo, or TED, is usually run through the proprietary Adobe Flash player as a .flv video. Downloading and installing FlashVideoReplacer is a way to reject proprietary software while showing solidarity with the users and developers of free software.

note: there is also [the Gnash free software Flash player](https://www.fsf.org/campaigns/priority-projects/). Personally, I like to improve video resolution and minimize laggy streaming by downloading with FlashVideoReplacer (though FlashVideoReplacer also does streaming).

What about multiple licenses?,jaykay-47,16,4,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/freeculture/comments/1begtf/can_people_decreative_commons_something_what/,"I am in a nonprofit and often use Creative Commons images from Wikimedia Commons and Flickr. However, I sometimes run into a dilemma about how people use Creative Commons licenses.

The first dilemma is that Wikimedia Commons will sometimes have content from Flickr that, when it was uploaded to WC, was licensed under Creative Commons. But when you go to Flickr, it's listed as copyrighted. But WC has a bot that verifies that at X date in the past, it was listed under a specific CC license, and many of the Flickr images will have an old comment from the person who put it on WC saying ""thank you for using Creative Commons"" etc. 

So can I use the CC image from Wikimedia Commons, even if the original was later put under copyright? In other words, once the creator pops, can they stop? I feel okay about using the image from WC, since it was uploaded as CC and is still listed as CC. I just worry that I'd be exposing my organization to some sort of liability.

The second dilemma is that some images on Flickr are listed under a permissive Creative Commons license (like CC BY), yet ALSO have one of those ""Get rights to this image via Getty"" buttons. So can I just use the image for free due to the CC, or does the pay-to-use Getty thing somehow supersede it? It doesn't make sense to me that something could be licensed in multiple ways . . . like I suppose if it was CC BY and I wanted to use it without attribution, maybe then I would license it? Why else would anyone pay for an image that is available for free?

Unrelated note: Recently met some folks from a big producer of CC content at a reception, and got to thank them in person for using Creative Commons :)",,False,,t5_49zi,False,,,True,t3_1begtf,http://www.reddit.com/r/freeculture/comments/1begtf/can_people_decreative_commons_something_what/,

",TheSilentNumber,13,4,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/freeculture/comments/nafcs/discussion_legitimacy_legality_and_direct_action/,"**tl;dr: What kind of direct action protests can we do to fight non-free software and cultural works?**

(Don't take this too seriously, and just skip to the end to get the the crux of the issue)

There is a debate within the free culture and free software communities (presented within the scope of software, where it is most relevant): 

**Permissive vs Copyleft**

Permissive licensing is mostly hands off, and allows for proprietary software to be made from free software. The argument here is that free software should be made by choice, or at least that the law shouldn't be relied upon to keep software free. 

Copyleft protects free software by preventing it from being appropriated to restrict users' freedom. One of the greatest opponents to free software is Apple, and they probably wouldn't be around (at least not as they are today) without taking free code (from BSD) and making it non-free. The argument here is clear: copyright can be a tool to protect free software. 

**Industry forces**

This section isn't very articulate, sorry. Probably unnecessary as well, skip if it if you're busy and you can come back to it later. 

So long as we live in a capitalist society (disregarding any judgement of it), money drives business and production. There is no reason that giving things away for free is *good* for a business. It might not be bad, and it may be made to work for many businesses, but is it really the case that a particular business is better off financially by making all the software they produce free? It may be better that the industry/economy/world as whole would be better off, but businesses tend to do what's best for them, and best for them in the short term (hence privatizing everything, stocking up on IP, all sorts of stupid wasted energy that genuinely keeps the particular business in its position but holds everyone back collectively). 

Free software, IMHO, is produced in ""enlightened self-interest"", but if the open source (business friendly, better software, better development, etc) view is wrong, and free software isn't inherently better for business, then copyright is an excellent tool to protect free software (through copyleft licensing). 

**Direct action**

What if we throw this framework out the window? Many grassroots social movements have depended on civil disobedience. Free software has no real form of protest. We, as users, can beg developers and companies to play nice and free their code (which makes no sense for businesses who make a killing off of proprietary software business models), and we can boycott, refuse to use proprietary software (as I think we should), but this is an extremely slow and painful way to get everyone using free software, truly impractical to expect from people. 

We can work within this scope of trying to fix laws and prevent worse laws from being enacted, but this is also slow and odds are not tilted in our favor. We can keep *making* free software, since we need that, but that's just enough to keep the dream alive. What can we do that truly disrupts the non-free media industry? 

**Traditional tactics**: 

Just to bang out a few of the worst...

 * Murder (just using Wikipedia's list of tactics): Certainly disruptive. Could yield results. In cases where software freedom is a matter of [life and](http://www.reddit.com/r/freesoftware/comments/jiia4/what_are_the_best_free_software_quotes/) death (life and death is a bizarre construction, because everything impacts human lives to varying degrees, and sometimes the most indirect causes have the most profound impacts), this could be an attempt to save more lives than cost. On the other hand, it could just be murder. 
 * Assault: Scare tactic similar to murder. 
 * Property destruction: If so much can be destroyed that it is [no longer profitable](http://redd.it/mijlo) to make non-free works, then this could be an effective tactic, even if it is marked as terrorism. On the other hand, it would take a shit-ton of destruction and the type of people willing to do that for...software. 
 * Sabotage: Usually requires insiders. Very risky. Similar effect on perceived legitimacy. 

Okay, so even when applied tactically (cutting off power or internet connection rather than burning down a building) we're probably all in agreement that those aren't good/feasible/sensible tactics. Let's move on...

 * Sit ins, human barricades, etc: Could disrupt a business but in the unbelievable event that people would actually participate in such an event, large market forces will dismiss the demand for free code as communist, etc. 
 * Disruptive pranks: Make a mess or padlock gates to keep people from working might have some impact, but again, this is probably stupid. 
 * Strikes, workplace occupations: Yeah, programmers are going to demand their employers make code free and destroy the stable business model that results in a paycheck? 

These traditional tactics tend to be successful for issues more in the public eye. Are there no tactics that are particularly good at disrupting the business of proprietary software and non-free works? Does it really just boil down to educating users, begging non-free producers, and cheerleading for free ones? Are any of these tactics actually useful (or would they be, if we did a better job of educating people on free culture issues)?

**So, what ideas do you have for direct action techniques specifically to further free software and free culture?**

Here are some: 

 * Piracy: but it doesn't make proprietary software free. 
 * Unionize: get programmers everywhere to join [IU 560](http://www.iww.org/en/unions/dept500/iu560)
 * Leak source code: Illegal to use, any software which does will likely have a tough time getting mass-adoption, but still awesome for reverse engineering formats and protocols. 
 * Hacktivism: These are cool, but usually not very democratic. Either a capable person/group to deface a web page, or masses of people would be required to DDoS one. Still, how cool would it be to have the Sony website showing some images about DRM and suing hackers?
 * Email bombing: Maybe, difficult to get mass participation.

Free Software (and Open Source) have been doing well for decades. The greatest threats to either of them are DRM, patents, and ignorance. The FSF promotes anti-freeculture-FUD entitled ""Why this license?"" and on their licenses page. Non-free culture OK, non-free software bad. Sigh.

Free culture doesn't always come with source code. The sources help, but a digital master isn't as necessary (when you have a readable analog copy) for purposes of remix as source code is to binaries. 

That's not, as Stallman seems to use it, an argument against the need for free culture. It doesn't make them fundamentally different, or remove the fundamental need for freedom. 

RMS and more importantly the FSF (as they're two different things) need to stop spreading FUD that downplays the need for free culture. Being inspired by free software doesn't mean RMS can spend years insisting ""no, you don't get it, they're different"" and be dismissive to the point of offering CC ND video to OER projects (Free Academy.) It's not just unethical and short-sighted, it's Not Even Wrong. Please, FSF, make the FSF website OER-compatible. Do it for the Library of Humankind, do it for the software of the mind!

I love this sub, been lurking for awhile and I know that there are some really knowledgeable people here so hopefully someone can educate me on this.

I know that companies can delete a user's account (Facebook, Steam, whatever) if the user violates the TOS/AUP. What I don't understand is what their legal options are in the case of someone who is not a subscribed user of the service, but violates the TOS/AUP anyway by accessing public parts of the service in a way the company forbids. Not by copyrighted content infringement (that I understand better), but say for example the company says ""if you access the public parts of our site, you can't do it by anything other than a normal web browser (no scripts)"".

So for non-subscribers of a public service/website, with terms of service / acceptable use policies that don't involve copyright law, how are those enforceable? What legal remedies are usually available (it seems crazy to fine someone or sue for damages when there's nothing they ""lost"" and no additional cost incurred by them, but then as everyone here is aware, crazy doesn't mean it isn't law). And does fair use still apply the way it does in copyright (if you can show that you meet those four criteria)?

1367876709.0,7,self.freeculture,1dti67,My two new projects aim the teach the craft of screenwriting and the art of formatting...absolutely free [x-post from /r/screenwriting],historic66,8,1,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/freeculture/comments/1dti67/my_two_new_projects_aim_the_teach_the_craft_of/,"Before we start, I should probably answer the question everyone is likely thinking: who the hell are you?

That's a valid question, and here's the answer:

My name is Clint Lowrance and I've been writing screenplays all my life, although it wasn't until my junior year of high school that I finally made one of my scripts into a film. That same year, I started work on my first feature length screenplay, Prime, which I will be re-working as a case study in the book.

Over the next year, I made a half dozen short films. During this time I also entered the first year of the (now) annual [SATO 48 Film Challenge](https://www.facebook.com/pages/SATO48/283865868312255), participating for the next seven years, being nominated for [Best Screenplay](http://db.tt/5R0RQvu0) in my final year.

In 2010, I graduated from Ozarks Technical Community College with an AAS in Electronic Media Production. Two years later, I graduated from Missouri State University with a BS in Digital Film Production. Currently, I am a graduate student in the Media, Journalism, and Film Department at Missouri State, focusing on Screenwriting, under the direction of Ms. [Diana Botsford](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0098595/).

During my time at OTC, I served as co-creator/writer/director and actor for the webseries Burnt Out with Mr. [Cherokee Turner](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4115287/) (for various reasons, I cannot provide links to this project, although I hope to change this in the near future).

During my final undergraduate semester at MSU, I wrote and directed the short *[Thrown](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2342391/)*, which premiered at MSU's annual Senior Showcase. Mr. [Charlie Cline](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0166827) served as an executive producer for this project.

Currently, I am writing, producing, and directing a small handful of projects, including the webseries t.b.d., the tie-in comic series' *Tales from the Queen City* and *Phenix*, and the tie-in video game *Circle of Heroes*.

At the completion of my [campaign](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/so-you-want-to-be-a-screenwriter-and-underwood/x/362991), I will use the funds to support myself for two months while I write my book “So You Want To Be A Screenwriter?”, which will be part style manual, part storytelling guide. Upon completion, it will be released for free download under a Creative Commons BY-SA license, as well as for purchase under that same license on Kindle, Nook, and (hopefully) the iBooks and Google Books stores.

At the same time, with the assistance of a few friends, I will fork Celtx under the GPL, releasing it under the name Underwood. Additionally, we will attempt to implement several new features, including free cloud saves through Dropbox integration, budgeting, title page customization, and teleplay formatting (adding an “Act” element, including “SMASH TO BLACK” as a standard transition, etc).

While working on these two projects, I plan to research/write Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and work on Underwood Thursday and Friday.

I have broken down my monthly bills (for transparency) below:

Rent = $525

Utilities = $50

Internet/Cable = $50 (I get both so I don't have to sign a contract)

Phone = $75 (I have my phone financed through T-Mobile, so they tack on a little each month, $25, I believe)

Gas = $15 (I don't drive much, but there are times when I must)

Food and other expenses = $100

Tuition = $150 (I have to take a summer class online)

Total (x2) = $1,700 ($850 x 2)

Below are a few samples of my work (some are works in progress, so take them with a grain of salt).

[Railroad Rob](http://db.tt/sWS3HqBT) (written as a a writing challenge in which I attempted to properly break up a rather lengthy monologue)

[A Little Bad News](http://db.tt/ADo4S0Ny)

[The Walking Dead - “Perchance to Dream](http://db.tt/81eHGJbe) (written as a spec script for a grad class; work in progress)

t.b.d. minisode - [Cigar](http://db.tt/fChI7kCU)

t.b.d. minisode - [That Girl My Parents Hate](http://db.tt/GbZx1PQE)

t.b.d. - [Pilot](http://db.tt/P0SnhPWA) (work in progress)

t.b.d. - [The One With The Blackout](http://db.tt/VSGmDONO) (work in progress)    
    
      
    
Some people just can’t contribute. That's fine. Trust me, I get it. But that doesn't mean you aren't still **vital** to this campaign. Whether you contribute $1, $10, $100, or nothing at all, I do ask that you do the following:

1. Get the word out there and encourage your friends to do the same. Make some noise!
2. Like Underwood on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Underwood/167317213433629?fref=ts)
3. Follow Underwood on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/librescreenplay)
4. Join the Underwood [subreddit](http://reddit.com/r/underwood)

Additionally, if you're a programmer (especially if you have experience working with Celtx, Mozilla/Firefox, or developing addons for the Mozilla framework) get in touch! My programming experience is somewhat limited, so I can always use more help.

First is the basic donate to an existing/completed project. This is already allowed on PayPal i'm pretty sure but does anyone know if it is against Google Checkout's terms of service to collect donations if you're not a non-profit? 

Next is the threshold pledge system, where a fundraising goal is set and people make a pledge. Optionally money might not collected unless and until the threshold (goal) is met to ensure it doesn't go nowhere. There are third-party sites that provide this for an unreasonable cost, so might it make sense for something like this to be implemented directly in Checkout/Paypal?

Her article unfortunately mingles this with class inequality, and reaches the conclusion that free content will evaporate the middle class.  
  
Now, there are of course a few easy counter-arguments to make here. Starting with the fact that the music industry has [always been](http://www.negativland.com/news/?page_id=17), and [still is](http://www.altpress.com/contributors/entry/veteran_artist_manager_mike_kaminsky_on_the_revenue_model_of_artists), a lottery game with only a very few winners. It is also an obvious exaggeration to spell doom for the entire middle class due some failed journalists and musicians.  
  
Beyond that though, is free content and work different this time around? Does making it ""on the Internet"" or ""with a computer"" give a privileged few better chances, or does it level the playing-field?

I'm doing some research on the connections between the free culture movement and private BitTorrent communities. I frequently hear the BitTorrent model described by proponents in quite utopian terms, as a force for destabilizing the culture industry and returning the tools for distributing intellectual property to creators and users and thereby encouraging creativity, but it seems to me that private trackers are not very 'free' cultures: they seem quite locked down, difficult to get into, and require a non-trivial 'investment' (whether time or money).

",TheSilentNumber,24,21,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/freeculture/comments/13fxi9/is_the_term_free_culture_too_libertarianneoliberal/,"The term ""free culture"" reminds me too much of ""[free speech](http://news.infoshop.org/article.php?story=20100419121217658)"", ""free markets"", ""free trade"", etc. Is there a word other than 'free' which encompasses more than just ""anyone should be totally free to do whatever they want with any piece of culture"", for many of the same reasons as free speech is a problematic idea (see previous link)? Although in some contexts, like ""[free association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_association_%28communism_and_anarchism%29)"" (not to be confused with [freedom of association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_association)), ""free"" is not a neoliberal concept, I think it is here. 

Of course, the state shouldn't have the power to employ broad censorship, nor should ideas be treated as private property, but there are more nuanced considerations of power that need to be taken into account. Cultural misappropriation and racism, for one. I don't want a free culture movement that is ignorant, agnostic to, or endorsing of these behaviors. 

I'm trying to consider the way that ""anarchism"" means ""without rulers"", not ""[without order/organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomie)"". I want something that could potentially mean ""without state or property regulation"", not ""without any social consideration for cultural appropriation"". 

Perhaps the term ""free culture"" can apply to the copyright/IP status of works themselves, but I don't know how I feel about it applying to the movement overall. Not that I think we should try to immediately get rid of a term that has a lot of momentum behind it-- I would just appreciate an alternative way to talk about it.

Since CC doesn't assert copyright in its licences, it seems like you could create a CC SA 3.0 equivalent by taking the CC BY-SA 3.0 licence and removing the attribution requirements.

Here is an awesome one called [The Atomic War](http://imgur.com/a/IPD3U#0).  I would like to do some sort of project to make this resource more accessible, show off how awesome public domain comics can be.

My thought is to use python and opencv to chop up each page into a series of panels, then have a large archive of those panels available for people to be able to remix into new comics.  At first I would just make the panels available, but over time I could add additional metadata like panel dimensions, color palette, description of the panel, or which characters show up in which panels.

Does this idea appeal to anyone?  What would people like to see out of a project like this? Would anyone like to help?

Wondering if you could steer me in the correct direction for some information about showing documentaries publicly. All I know is that, in the past few years, a group at my residence hall was asked to stop their weekly movie nights. Or . . . they were asked to stop advertising, but they still did the movie nights? I imagine that there is legal tomfoolery at play, happily avoided by using works in the public domain or works copyrighted by Creative Commons Share-Alike. So, what's the word on showing movies publicly? Thank you!

This isn't internet radio per se. It's more like the streaming feature in iTunes where you can play songs from other people's iTunes on the same network as you. But on a larger scale .. a much larger scale, say, the entire internet.

If user's are streaming their own music to others via the internet, are there any DMCA rules/restrictions against that?

Any help would would be appreciated. Thanks reddit",,False,,t5_49zi,False,,,True,t3_d6pt2,http://www.reddit.com/r/freeculture/comments/d6pt2/dmca_laws_regarding_streaming_not_internet_radio/,

the images i'm using were found on flickr, using the advanced search, and toggling all the creative commons check boxes (indicating 'OK to use commercially' and 'permission to change/modify' the work).

as im sure you know, this search only grabs content marked by the ""attribution"" license. for a while, i didn't think twice about using the photos that popped up. but then i saw that some of the variations of attribution license make it through flickr's filter. notably, the ""sharealike"" clause.

as i mentioned before, the video will eventually be used commercially. my question is this...

how do you reconcile content that has both the 'commercial use OK' attribution label, but then also has the sharealike label? isn't for profit use of attribution-sharealike content inherently NOT sharing alike? or does this basically just mean the record label would have to release the video as CC-attribution-share alike, so the label would have to sacrifice its profit-exclusivity to the video.

if thats right, then it really doesn't make much sense to use any attribution-sharealike content commercially. say hypothetically, if the band changed labels, then wouldn't that mean the new label could release the video from THIS label without issue?

anyway, thats it. i know i'm overthinking this, but i really love the CC and i want to get it right as a matter of principle.",,False,,t5_49zi,False,,,True,t3_cinh3,http://www.reddit.com/r/freeculture/comments/cinh3/question_about_attributionsharealike/,
