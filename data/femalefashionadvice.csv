1358405011.0,697,self.femalefashionadvice,16qn7h,"Hello, FFA! I'm a bit new to this sub, but I noticed many of you are in ill-fitted bras.",JoanOfSarcasm,822,125,436,http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/16qn7h/hello_ffa_im_a_bit_new_to_this_sub_but_i_noticed/,"It's really hard to write this without sounding/feeling like a creepy stalker who stares at your chests all day, but as a woman who's been in badly fitting bras, I identify bad bras pretty easily now that I'm in a properly sized one. 

I've been lurking this sub for about a month or less now -- someone dropped by a sub I frequent and said she was referred to us by someone here. And since I'm basically illerate in the language of fashion, I figured I'd subscribe and see what I could learn (which has been great, by the way! I've started noticing WHAT seems off now with certain outfits rather than just ""feeling"" like something is off). In the process, I've noticed that many here aren't in bras that fit right. 

A fitting bra is more than just a number and a letter. It affects your breast health, posture, and even how well your bust fits and looks in clothes. As a quick example, [here is a great visual of how a badly fitting band as well as a proper one affects how your breasts sit](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CKU61X3PimM/TdwMi0xYIPI/AAAAAAAABcQ/QylXzgfBRyg/s640/bra_band_size_compare_30GG_28H_26HH.jpg).

I've also seen women who appear to be DD+ saying they're in C cups or smaller (with enormous band sizes!). Since there's always a bit of a misconception of ""cup size"" among those of us who have been in a wrong size for far too long (Victoria's Secret consistently sized me at a 34C -- I'm a 28FF!), please know that a [DD is not as big as you think it is](http://i.imgur.com/9XPLe.jpg) and that measuring breasts by cup alone is incorrect. Cup size is nothing without band size. This is why the logic of throwing women into bigger bands to get bigger cups is *so wrong*. I think the biggest thing we see over at /r/abrathatfits are new measures that go ""I can't be an FF!"" or ""I can't be a DD!"" This goes back to bust and band sizes. Just as you go up in a band size, the cups sizes of a bra go up. [Here is a great picture](http://i.imgur.com/8kZMs.jpg) illustrating how band and bust size correlates. [And another](http://i.imgur.com/KGEg6.jpg).

Anyways, this is a bit rambly, and I don't really know how to word this without feeling creeptacular, but *please* [measure yourselves](http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/rh26h/is_getting_fitted_for_a_bra_as_humiliating_as_it/c469bi0) over at /r/abrathatfits (even if you've been measured by a fitter at VS or the like) sometime if you have any of these symptoms of a bad bra:

* A bra that doesn't lift -- it simply sits ontop of your breasts and mooshes them
* A gore (central part of the bra) [that doesn't tack](http://cdn.breakoutbras.com/images/sizing1-frontwire-placement1-bad.jpg), especially after [swooping and scooping](http://bustyresources.wikia.com/wiki/Scoop_and_swoop) ([here](http://i.imgur.com/9eKt1.jpg) is a photo of a properly ""tacked"" gore)
* A band that rides up
* Straps that curve away from your body in the back (band is too big)
* Strapless bras that slip down constantly
* Straps that fall down
* Gapping in the top of the cups (this can happen at any size, but especially seems problematic among A and B cups)
* ""Quadboobing"" or excess breast tissue that has nowhere to go in the cups
* Breast tenderness when you take off your bra that has nothing to do with your time of the month
* Neck pain
* Back pain
* Straps that dig into your shoulders
* Breasts that fall out of the center of the bra
* Breasts that fall out of the bottom of the bra
* Excess ""armpit fat"" ([this can actually be breast tissue](http://bustyresources.wikia.com/wiki/File:Migratedbreasttissue.jpg))

[Here are pictures of some of the symptoms](http://www.breakoutbras.com/sizing).

Here is my Before-After in my most-comfortable Victoria's Secret 34C and one of my new 28FFs:

* [Here is my before picture](http://i.imgur.com/6ixzO.jpg) -- 34C.
* [Here is an after picture](http://i.imgur.com/5fE7h.jpg) -- 28FF Freya Jolie. Not the same angle -- sorry about that.
* [And here is an album of my collection of 30F/28FF bras, comparing them to my best-fitting 34C](http://imgur.com/a/ZRjDz#0).

I hope this helps someone. :)

**IF YOU WANT TO GET FITTED**

First, measure yourself at home. While some places have better track records than others at measuring you into the correct size, you should always try going into the store already having a starting point (that's what a bra measurement at home is -- a starting point!). From there, be fitted by the fitter and try on the bras they recommend. Also try on bras close to your size, especially in the [sister sizes](http://i.imgur.com/6KJjw.png). A sister size is a bra that is smaller or larger in the band, but retains volume in the cup. Once you know the cup sizes (AA, A, D, DD, E, F, FF, G, GG, H, HH, I, etc), just apply this: go up one cup size, go down a band size. Go down a band size, go up a cup size. This is why I wear *both* a 28FF and a 30F depending on brand. This is especially important for women in mid-underbust measurements -- 29, 31, 33, etc. *And please note that a band WILL feel overly tight in the larger band size if your cup is too small, since your tissue moves into the band area!* And DO NOT FORGET to [scoop and swoop](http://bustyresources.wikia.com/wiki/Scoop_and_swoop) when putting on a bra in any size!

I mean really, the clothes are undeniably cute, unique, and interesting to look at. I know for some of you, twee is completely out of the question. That’s perfectly fine! It’s definitely not for everyone.   I wrote this guide to Modcloth, for those of you who love twee. I hope you guys find it useful!

*I should mention this guide is more on ""How to do Modcloth right"" I've touched on twee because it is used in a lot of Modcloth fashion.

**Should I buy it on Modcloth?**    
The prices on Modcloth have a large range. There are plenty of affordable items—especially if you check out their sale section or wait for their clearance sales.  Sometimes they mark their items up a good $10-$15 more than other stores. Of course, you aren’t going to be able to find *all* of Modcloth’s items in other stores. (They'll also do $15 off your first purchase if someone referred you. Message me if you want a referral, I'll get the $15 too)

Here are some stores that have similar stuff:    
* [Francesca’s](http://www.francescas.com/)       
* [Ruche]( http://shopruche.com/)     
* [Spotted Moth]( http://spottedmoth.com/)   
* [Asos]( http://us.asos.com)    
* [UrbanOG]( http://www.urbanog.com/) (mostly their shoes)

I could have made this list longer to include a few other stores, but the more I looked through them, the more they started to look like forever 21. These stores have a more defined style.

**Some reasons people love MC**    
1. The customer reviews + product descriptions:  They have a cult-like customer base. People are enthusiastic about the store.  They write a lot of reviews; they post a lot of pictures.  The product descriptions tell you what the items are made of, whether it runs large or small, and whether or not the fabrics provide stretch.    
2.They have very good customer service: They have an instant chat service that you can talk to their representatives to get their advice or ask questions about how things fit. Within the US, shipping is free over $50, and returns are always 100% free.  You just print out the return label and you can even give your package to your USPS mail carrier.      
3. It's really easy to sort through their clothes by size, color, key words, styles, lengths. It’s like shopstyle, but built into the site.    
4. There's a huge plus sized selection of clothing that actually looks like the regular sized clothes. They also have dresses in longer lengths for you tall ladies.            

**Some reasons people don’t:**     
1. The price    
2. Clothing is too cutesy/twee; not to their aesthetic taste     
3. MC’s diversity of brands means not everything is going to be the same quality. Prices don’t seem to correlate to quality. Sometimes expensive items are cheaply made, sometimes they’re not. It’s hard to tell just by looking at pictures. (easy, free returns and reviews help with this one)        
4. A lot of the time, they don't tell you what the brand of the clothes are. I can't blame them though, they are a business after all. Again, you could always order it and return it if you find it cheaper. Or chat with their reps. 

My opinion is that if you really like something, just order it and see. The returns are free.

**If so many people like MC, why is it frowned upon here on FFA?**     
1. It comes back to the quality of clothing.  Sometimes, it’s just not worth the price. There are other places you can get better quality things for less.        
2. MC is over the top with their cutesy promoting and presentation. It’s to the point of being sickeningly sweet and annoying      
3. People overdo it. Plain and simple: people wear too much stuff while trying to accessorize and be different.      
    
**What do you mean “overdo it?” am I overdoing it?**     

Modcloth loves to post style lookbooks. Upon first glance, you might think they're well put together and cohesive. The longer you look, the easier it will be to see that *holy shit, could she BE wearing any more clothes?!*  Obviously, people in the real world don’t normally dress this way. MC is a business and businesses will try to sell their products. The more products their models are wearing: the more products gain visibility. You are not a Modcloth model. You did just not step out of a lookbook.

You can wear almost anything overly cute or bold, but when you start pairing it with other things to match it, that’s when it’s going to be too much. It’s going to look like you tried really hard to put your look together. It will look forced.

**“Modcloth done wrong” [ALBUM](http://imgur.com/a/4m46O)**    
 In depth reasons and descriptions found in the album.    

**Comparisons before we move on**    
[Striped color cardigan](http://i.imgur.com/7i0TESX.jpg)     
On the left: The dress pattern and the cardigan have too much visual stimulation. The bow on top of that puts the outfit over the top. The shoes are also very heavy looking. I would generally recommend against wearing a shirt under a dress if you can, especially if the dress has a pattern on it (or if it’s heavily textured or colored)    
On the right: replace the dress with some simple dark jeans and she looks that much neater. The cardigan stands alone as the focal point of the outfit. The polka dotted tights/socks are unnecessary.

[Striped primary colors dress](http://i.imgur.com/zwf0pHh.jpg)    
On the left: The dress is a bold statement on its own. She pairs it with a neutral heel and her outfit is simple. It fits well and she looks effortlessly put together, with only one item of clothing on.     
On the right: She matches the headband, her tights, and her shoes to the dress. The colors are overwhelming, especially the yellow tights.    
The dress might look a little bit young by itself, but if you wear it right, it **can** look age appropriate.

**More examples of how to do MC right please!**

[Inspiration album I put together](http://imgur.com/a/8hwwH)


**Key notes:**          
-One or two non-neutral colors per outfit [refer here](http://imgur.com/a/4m46O#vytJsmz)     
-Unique items in neutral colors are easily paired into other outfits without looking costumey [refer here](http://imgur.com/a/8hwwH#1vhLATQ)    
-If you choose a brightly colored or heavily patterned article, let it stand on its own for attention [refer here](http://imgur.com/a/8hwwH#rKJrslr)    
- Patterns can be mixed more successfully when they are in the same color family [refer here](http://imgur.com/a/8hwwH#BhviOYD)     
-You don’t need to match everything with everything [refer here](http://imgur.com/a/4m46O#TTIHaBD)   

Thanks for reading! Questions and comments are appreciated. I'll be editing as we go along :)

**EDIT**

I am not judging anyone who wishes to dress twee to the fullest extent. The guide is for the number of you who do like elements of twee, but *can't* go all out. For how to make that one special item you had to have but couldn't figure out how to work it into everyday wear. 

I definitely AM a person who loves the overly cute things, but being practical: it doesn't work all the time. One of the biggest things about fashion and getting it right is knowing when which outfits are appropriate. 

If you want to wear knee highs, go for it. If you want to carry a handbag shaped like a kitten riding a roomba, go for it. If you want to match all of your items to your other items, go ahead and do it. This is a guide! Not an instruction manual. You just do you. &lt;3

Thank you guys for the support and comments. I may not have replied to everyone, but I did give you guys upvotes. :)

I will disclaim that I know almost absolutely nothing about fashion, but what I *do* know is about colors and the color wheel. I am currently an art student but every artist should know about the color wheel and how to manipulate colors; essentially, a colored wardrobe is what that is--manipulating colors successfully to bring out the best look possible for different colored people.


So you must be wondering, **what *is* the color wheel?**


[Well, this is a color wheel.](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_CDzu3Nv8RwE/TKFKFob3ZDI/AAAAAAAACKE/BRz4MQRAaRc/s1600/ColorWheel2.jpeg) (albeit not a very good one, but I'll try to find a better picture, or just paint one myself :\ but this will just get my message across for now)

Well, you FFA's must be wondering what's up with this rainbow? Well, there are **3 primary colors** that make up all the rest of the colors in the rainbow. 

*Red, Blue, and Yellow* are the *3 Primary Colors.* 

Now, a very simple color mixing idea: 

* Red + Yellow = Orange

* Blue + Yellow = Green

* Red + Blue = Violet

[Orange, Green, and Violet are 3 *Secondary Colors* whereas Red, Blue, and Yellow are the 3 *Primary Colors*.](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vUprSPmTrLg/TyHLCAh0TSI/AAAAAAAAAAg/DQ5I3AJujsU/s1600/hdiusghacf.jpg)

With me so far?

So those are the secondary colors. Now, we will move on to the **tertiary colors.** To make tertiary colors, you take primary colors and mix them with a secondary color.

* Yellow + Green = Yellow-green

* Yellow + Orange = Yellow-orange

* Red + Orange = Red-orange

* Red + Violet = Red-violet

* Blue + Green = Blue-green

* Blue + Violet = Blue-violet

[This is a color wheel showing the different tertiary colors.](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CqZ-pm1W7ec/TXBa3g9y3KI/AAAAAAAAARc/zLJ5SRTiVrk/s1600/tertiary%2Bcolors.jpg)


Now that you have some of the basics of the color wheel, let's add a little bit more information.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Color schemes**


There are different color schemes: 

* Analogous color scheme

* Complementary color Scheme

* Split-analogous color scheme

* Split-complementary color scheme

* Triadic color scheme

* Tetrads color scheme

* Neutral color scheme

* Accented neutral color scheme

* Warm and cool color schemes

* Monochromatic color scheme

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Analogous color scheme**

One color scheme that is definitely something that is always used in fashion, and something that is super easy to apply is called **analogous color scheme**. Analogous colors schemes are color schemes that take three colors that are next to each other in the color wheel and make something out of them. [This is a color wheel example](http://www3.dmps.k12.ia.us/north/nhsvisualarts/images/color/colorwhgana.gif)

Analogous color schemes are very popular in fashion as well. Here are some examples:

[This is a super easy example for you to show and see what I'm trying to explain to you all.](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CZp9sWzeoZc/TgTsV3RWiYI/AAAAAAAAAOA/iefS-c9Q8g0/s1600/analog.jpg)

Notice how everything is using Blue, Blue-green, and Green? That's a way to apply the color scheme to your wardrobe.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Complementary color scheme**

Now, you FFA-ers must be wondering why Yellow + Violet, Red + Green, or Blue + Orange isn't a tertiary color combination? Well that's because all those combinations are *opposites* of each other and they are called **complementary colors.**

Have you noticed? Red + Green are Christmas colors, but outside of the holidays, they seem to go so well together. They *complement* each other ~~(*duhh*)~~. Another reason they are called complementary is because, theoretically, if you mix 1:1 ratio of those colors together they make each color duller, making it gray. If you refer back to one of the color wheels, any color across from each other, called color opposites make a complementary color. Meaning these colors make a complement:

* Red + Green

* Yellow + Violet

* Blue + Orange

* Yellow-green + Red-Violet

* Yellow-orange + Blue-Violet

* Red-orange + Blue-Green

If you would like to dress really boldly, you can try to go for the complementary color scheme:

[Yellow + Purple](http://www.home-jewelry-business-success-tips.com/images/yellow-purple-complementary-color-scheme-polyvore-350x349.jpg)

[Or even the middle colors.](http://www.topbilling.com/website/admin/UserFiles/Image/Lifestyle/dairy%20of%20Fashionista/2011/october%202011/S-FINAL-1.jpg)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Split-analogous color scheme**

Split analogous color scheme is a color scheme that includes a primary color and two colors one space away from it on each side of the color wheel. [An example is yellow, green, and blue.](http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/set?id=54795422)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Split-complementary color scheme**

Split-complementary color schemes are colors that follow a primary color and the secondary colors surrounding the primary colors' complement. For example, [Red + Blue-green + Yellow-green make a split-complementary color scheme.](http://www3.dmps.k12.ia.us/north/nhsvisualarts/images/color/colorwhjtrsc)

[here is an example](http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/set?id=54796889)

Please excuse my crappy tastes. This is for example only... ;;&gt;_&gt;

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Triadic color scheme**

As the implies, the traidic color scheme makes a triangle on the color wheel. For example, the primary colors, red, blue, and yellow make a triadic color scheme.

[Example](http://www3.dmps.k12.ia.us/north/nhsvisualarts/images/color/colorwhjtr.gif)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Tetrads color scheme**

Tetrads or quadrads are any four colors with a logical relationship on the color wheel, such as double complements such as yellow + violet and green + red

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Neutral color scheme**

Now a lot of people mention neutrals on FFA so here are the list of neutrals. Neutral colors are colors not found on the color wheel.

These are the netural colors

* Beige

* Brown

* Gray

* Black

* White

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Accented neutral color scheme**

Accented neutral color scheme includes 1 or more bright/bold colors in tiny bits or small *accents* with a neutral color.

For example, brown and beige with blue accents or gray and black with red accents.

[This is another example](http://cdn.greenweddingshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/neon-shoes-DIY-01.jpg)

Another way to wear accented colors is black/white and red accessories or something of the sort. You get the idea.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Warm and cool color schemes**

During season changes, the colors change as well. For example, summer and spring seasons tend to use warmer colors and fall and winter use cooler colors. 

What does this mean, you say?

Warm colors include: 

* Red

* Red-Violet

* Yellow

* Orange.... etc.

Cool colors include:

* Blue

* Green... etc.

**THIS IS IMPORTANT MUST READ** 

I want you guys to know that orange can be a cool color too! If orange has more blue in it than orange then its more of a cool color. The colors I've listed are just basic guidelines. The same thing applies with purple. There can be a [warmer colored purple](http://www.finestpashmina.com/specials/Shawl-Warm-Purple/Shawl-Warm-Purple_2-tn.jpg) or a [cooler colored purple](http://www.thesaddlery.co.uk/images/cooler_purple.jpg) (although that horse saddle is almost blue-violet but you guys get my point).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Monochromatic color scheme**

Monochromatic color schemes are derived from a base hue (one color), and by adding black or white, making a different color. As a result, if you dress like this, colors will be a little bit more subtle and boring, but if you add some diverse patters in it, it could totally change things up.

[Here it is on a color block](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/CPT-Websites-monochrome.svg/201px-CPT-Websites-monochrome.svg.png)

[Here is an example of monochromatic color scheme.](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_d5jVH0q1y80/SfFwsJ6PY1I/AAAAAAAAAb8/Zvo_dyQOUy8/s400/moodboard5.jpg)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*sigh of relief* Okay that was a lot of information. I hope you guys can take this knowledge and apply it to the future and no more posts about what color goes with what okay? :)

There are very tricky colors however. For example, coral is really in right now and that goes with mint green but just remember to refer back to the original hues. Ask yourself, is this coral more red or orange? What's the complement with red? So the logic behind mint green + coral is pretty easy--they're complements! I hope you all can apply this knowledge to the future.

##What is fit?


Fit is the child of two elements: a garment’s construction + your specific measurements. For our purposes, good fit refers to clothing that ***covers the body as intended while obeying the design of the garment and properties of its fabric.*** Poor fit includes clothing that is too tight, too loose, too long, too short, too narrow, too wide, or in which the body parts of the garment do not line up with your own.


Fit is not objective. “Good fit” is dependent on specific styles and silhouettes; an “oversized fit” is not breaking the rules because it follows a different standard. Unfortunately, those styles are beyond the scope of this guide. For now, we’re just going to focus on ensuring correct fit in an everyday, basic wardrobe.


##Why is fit problematic?


While the industrialization of clothing production has made clothing cheap and plentiful, it has also introduced fit issues as all adult female body types are shoehorned into a handful of height categories, about a dozen numeric sizes, and a slight hourglass/pear silhouette. The US size system today is based on non-representative samples collected in the 1940s when women were, on average, 1” shorter and 25lbs lighter than today. This, coupled with a lack of standardization and widespread vanity sizing, means that tagged sizes are relatively meaningless.


Signs of poor fit may include:


* clothing so tight it compresses the skin
* clothing so loose that it falls off
* clothing that is restrictive or uncomfortable in a normal range of motion
* fabric pulling apart at stress points
* fabric creasing and folding on itself while standing still
* seams that don't line up with body parts


***


##Garment construction


Most manufactured clothing is made of swaths of fabric designed to cover each body part. The individual pieces are then sewn together to construct the garment, and those points are called [*seams*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seam_(sewing)). When fabrics rip during wear, they tend to rip at the seams because they are the site of the most motion and stress.


There are several different types of seams used for different purposes including [flat-felled seams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felled_seam) for flat edges and lapped seams for heavy fabrics. Some seams, particularly hems, are sewn with a larger-than-necessary allowance of excess fabric that can be let out if length is needed in that area.


Seams usually correspond to body parts.


* The shoulder seam of a garment should (usually) line up at the edge of your shoulders and inner corner of your armpit
* The waist seam of a dress should (usually) line up with your natural waist
* The side seams should run vertically down your sides
* The center back seam should run vertically down the center of your back (may be used in conjunction with side-back seams to create structure at the waist or spinal curve)
* [Darts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dart_(sewing)) and [princess seams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_seams) should align with the curves of the body.


***


##Assessing fit

The most practical way to illustrate fit is to walk through it, item by item. Always keep in mind that these are not rules but merely guidelines.


###BRAS + UNDERWEAR:


Obligatory plug for /r/abrathatfits, especially if you haven't been professionally fitted or if you’ve experienced weight changes since your last fitting. A correctly-fitting bra is comfortable, improves your posture, and does not show beneath your clothing. All other underwear should be tight to the body but nonrestrictive and comfortable. Spanx and other compression garments can be used to smooth out lines and bulges under clothes.


###TOPS


* **Shoulders**. In button-front shirts, the shoulder seam should generally line up at [a slight diagonal from the edge of the shoulder to your armpit](http://i.imgur.com/RjBlWuD.jpg?1). This is not a strict rule; there are several degrees of placement that can look good depending on your shoulder width and slope. A [completely vertical seam placement](http://i.imgur.com/3XxjG3P.jpg?1) can look good on certain styles of t-shirts, but [may look a little tight on tailored shirts](http://i.imgur.com/MKh7re7.jpg?1). Shoulders are difficult and costly to alter, so try to find a good fit the first time around.


    It also varies by style: *drop-shoulder* refers to shoulder seam placement that falls [somewhere along the upper arm](http://i.imgur.com/yESXRuX.jpg?1), common with oversized and “boyfriend fit” shirts. *Raglan* sleeves do not have shoulder seams at all, but [are attached to the body and tapered from the neck](http://i.imgur.com/bNepFBU.jpg?1).


* **Armholes**. In garment construction, the armhole or *armscye* is the point where sleeves are attached to the bodice of a garment. This is a site of widespread fit problems for both sexes; [this graphic](http://i.imgur.com/0txgjLC.jpg) shows how the same shoulder and sleeve measurements can result in different armhole angles due to slope and shape of the bust, shoulders, and upper arms.


    Most OTR clothing is designed to accommodate large upper arms and broad, athletic, or rounded shoulders, so armholes tend to be too big or placed too low for many people. (Low armholes aren’t all bad — they make a garment easier to put on, especially if it’s being worn as an outer layer.) [In this image](http://i.imgur.com/Kxp0eWZ.jpg), the yellow shirt represents an armhole that is too deep for the arm, leaving excess fabric in the armpit. While it isn’t *that* noticeable when your arms are down, as soon as you raise them, the excess fabric then [untucks your shirt, pulls up the body of the garment, and pushes up at the shoulders](http://i.imgur.com/BlXyYqz.jpg?1).

    Armholes are notoriously difficult to tailor: in order to slim them, the side seams and yoke must be let out and there is not always enough fabric available to re-shape the hole. Cuts advertised as “slim” or “tailored” tend to have higher armholes.


* **Bust and Waist**. Most women’s dress shirts contain either two bust darts, two waist darts or both, [one per side](http://i.imgur.com/NgsSBAi.jpg?1). Make sure that these darts actually correspond to your bust and waist. If they don’t, they’ll cause the excess fabric to crease. (I had trouble finding a picture of this; [here’s an example](http://i.imgur.com/nPSutZ3.jpg?1) where the placement is fine, but the darts look a little long, causing the fabric to pucker and a slight faux-nipple crease to develop.)


    Darts can also be added to the [sides or back](http://i.imgur.com/JhCO6bZ.jpg?1) to prevent [waist billowing](http://i.imgur.com/Za4Cv46.jpg?1).


* **Sleeve Length**. There are many sleeve lengths; [this post from Already Pretty](http://www.alreadypretty.com/2012/10/how-sleeve-length-impacts-figure-flattery.html) gives an overview of different lengths and their overall effect. To clarify a few options, [here’s a graphic showing the difference between ¾, bracelet, and full-length sleeves](http://i.imgur.com/j3zc7BN.jpg?1). Bracelet length is tricky because it can look like your sleeves are either too long for ¾ length or too short for full length.


    Generally, full-sleeve dress shirts [should end somewhere between the very edge of your wrist and about 1.5”-2” above your thumb knuckle.](http://i.imgur.com/clWADWQ.jpg?1) Sleeves tend to pull up as you use your arms, hence the long length. The guideline for women’s shirts is not as strict for men’s; there’s no requirement to have your sleeves poke out under your blazer, for example, though it can be a nice touch.


* **Hip**. Most untucked, regular-length shirts (not tunics, oversized, or cropped) look best when the hem falls somewhere between your lower waist and mid-crotch. This is *highly* dependent on several factors, including height, waist length (long- or short-waisted), and body type (pears might not want shirts to cut off right at the hip). You’ll have to play around with several lengths to see what works for you. [Here’s a comparative photo](http://i.imgur.com/feG3W6t.png) from the blog Putting Me Together that shows how shortening your shirt length can make a huge difference in your body proportions.",[Guide],False,self,t5_2s8o5,1375299275.0,guide,mod,True,t3_1jfgz8,http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1jfgz8/a_practicalvisual_guide_to_fit/,

Here are some rules for choosing glasses that are trendy and well fitting.

1. [The frame cannot touch your cheeks](http://i.imgur.com/scZiO.jpg). If it touches your cheeks when your face is relaxed that's a no. If it touches your cheeks when you smile, that's a no. Touching means the frame is just too big for your face. 

2. [It has to fit flush on the bridge of your nose](http://i.imgur.com/RQA1X.jpg). That means if you see a gap between the frame and your nose, the frame is too small for your bridge. This is not a personal affront to your nose, this is not an insult to the size of your nose, your nose doesn't need to fit into small glasses, just get ones with a wider bridge. 
3. [Glasses cannot hide your eyebrows](http://i.imgur.com/XXqLA.jpg). Where are your eyebrows? Hidden by the glasses? No, glasses must sit bellow your eyebrows, how far bellow is up to you.

Finally some general advice, choose what is comfortable and what you like and think looks good, trends come and go and glasses are expensive. Ladies with no bridge to your nose (most commonly seen in Asian women) plastic frames may never properly fit you because they are meant to sit on your bridge, if you have no bridge where are they supposed to sit? 

Finally, don't go with so thick a frame it looks like a mask or so thin a frame it completely blends into your face, even the most difficult face has thousands of styles that look good on it, they key is finding one of those styles and liking it too.

To ascertain a basic understanding of your body type:

Measure your bust at the fullest part

Measure your hips at the fullest part (often the groin or upper thighs)

Measure your waist at the narrowest point

I will use a hypothetical woman with 38 inch hips to discuss how your results may affects your body shape. 

**Women who do not have a very defined waist, ie, neither hip nor bust measurement is more than 8 inches greater than the waist measurement, are rulers. This can also be called the banana.** An example might be a woman who has 38 inch hips, a 32 inch waist, and a 37 inch bust. Her hips are nearly the same size as her bust, but her waist is not very defined. If a ruler feels she has a belly she wants to hide, she may prefer to follow guidelines for an apple.

**If your waist measurement is bigger than your hips or your bust measurements, you are an apple**. An example would be a woman with a 35 inch bust, 39 inch waist, and 38 inch hips.


**If your hips are your widest measurement by more than two inches, you are a pear.** An example would be a woman with a 35 inch bust, 25 inch waist, and 38 inch hips. 

**If your bust is your largest measurement by more than two inches, you are an inverted triangle or strawberry.**  An example would be a woman with a 41 inch bust, 32 inch waist, and 38 inch hips.

**If your bust and your hips are roughly the same size (within two inches), and your waist is at least 8-10 inches smaller you are an hourglass.** An example is a woman with a 37 inch bust, 27 inch waist, and 38 inch hips.



***That advice is wrong and doesn't work for my body type***

Body type advice is very, very limited (I will discuss this more in the final section) but can be useful for three reasons:

1) Many women do not have a sense of what their bodies actually look like and are hung up on a particular part or measurement. Having a sense of your silhouette can make a big difference-- you may feel like you have a belly but if your waist is tiny relative to your hips, you may look better thinking about how to play up your proportions rather than hide your belly.

2)It can help you understand why garments fit you the way they do, and why you have a particular set of fit challenges. 


3) Many women who are frustrated with their body would like to look more like an elongated hourglass. Understanding how your body overlaps or differs from this type can help you improve the way you dress. However, it is important to note that this is not every woman's goal but is a potential starting point.


**Ok cool, what do I do now?**

1) Search FFA and Google for recommendations for your body type. You will find a wealth of knowledge and past posts for [pears](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/search?q=pears&amp;restrict_sr=on), [apples](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/search?q=apple&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all), [reverse triangles](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/search?q=bust&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all, [hourglasses](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/search?q=hourglasses&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all) and [rulers](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/search?q=rulers&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all). Actually, re-looking at this, we haven't talked as much about rulers on FFA.

2) When reading this advice, think about whether you like it. Most advice is trying to help women create a more hourglass shape (ie pears should add volume up top, etc). These might not be your figure priorities. 

3) When looking for clothes, understand that most mall manufacturers are cutting their garments for a woman who has a slight pear shape (bust 7-8 inches larger than waist, hips about 10 inches larger than waist). This is the most common body type and manufacturers are interested in fitting as many women as possible into a given size. Many women post to FFA looking for the perfect brand that caters to their body type. Some brands may run curvier or straighter, but in general, there are very, very few brands that set out to cater to, say, the apple shaped woman. In general, you are going to have to buy clothing to fit the largest part of your body, and be prepared to either get things tailored, or buy things where a looser fit does not matter. However, it is worth paying attention to cuts that work for you. I'm an hourglass with a proportionately broader upper body and will always have better luck with Vero Moda (Danish company) than Uniqlo (Japanese company). A petite Asian woman is likely to have the opposite experience. 

4) If you are unsatisfied with this analysis and would like to go a bit deeper into dressing your body, please keep reading.


**More Advanced**

The first thing I would like to reinforce is that the idea of body type is very limited and just a jumping off point for understanding your silhouette. This idea has multiple components:

1) The most important thing is what aspects of your body you would personally like to play up and play down. Please read /u/Schiaparelli's excellent [guide in the side bar](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/15sej6/guide_understanding_fit_and_proportion_in_an/) for a really incredible take on proportion. Most body type advice is about looking skinnier or looking more like an hourglass. This might not be what you want. It's good to have a mental list in your head about what components you would like to play up or down. I have wide shoulders and like them to look bigger, not smaller. This may be different for your than for your friends or your shopping buddies, so have in mind how you would like to look. Hips are a real flash point for a lot of women so some women may say anything that emphasizes the hips looks bad. How you feel about this depends on your own personal proportions. 

That said, try to focus more on your overall silhouette than ""the area over my knee looks chunky and I hate it."" More people will see the forest, not the trees. There should be some balance between ""I'm an hourglass so I follow hourglass rules that work for all hourglasses"" and ""It's really important for me to hide my bony elbows, wide ribcage, and love handles, while making my calves look more proportionate. What style of dress will do that?""

2) There are many other body type systems and guides, many of which take more measurements into account and are more thorough. A personal favorite is Imogen Lamport's system, which you can read about [here](http://www.insideoutstyleblog.com/category/body-shapes-explained). If you are into this stuff, you can google around for a system that works best for you-- the one above is just the most common and straight forward as a starting point.

3) A lot of us don't find our body shape that important or helpful when dressing. You can read more about that in [this discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1ajwta/how_useful_do_you_find_body_type_when_developing/). On the other hand, many of us have found understanding our measurements helpful in order to [appreciate our bodies more](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1cektp/how_has_fashion_positively_impacted_your_views_on/).

4) Other measurements and proportions that may be helpful  in understanding your body (this is just a preliminary look):

-Height: if you are very tall, you may look more like a ruler despite having hourglass proportions, for instance. If you are very short, you will look a lot curvier than someone ten inches taller than you given the same measurements. (Sir Mixalot demonstrates an excellent understanding of this concept when stating his preference for curvier women: ""36-24-36? Ha ha, only if she's 5'3"".)

-Leg length to torso length

-[short waisted](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1a4rh0/what_worksdoesnt_work_for_a_short_waist/) versus long waisted: this intersects with torso length but is a bit different. 

-Hip shelf versus slope: do your hips start right under your waist or do you have a sloping curve out to your hips?

-Shoulder width: if you are a pear with broad shoulders, you may feel/look more like an hourglass. If you are an hourglass with broad shoulders, you may look more like an inverted triangle. 

-Underbust: how narrow is your torso, aside from your waist? Do you have a broad ribcage?

-butt versus hips: does your hip measurement come more from butt volume or from hip width? If you have a round/athletic butt, your hip measurement may be large but look relatively narrow from the front. 

-weight: skinnier women may appear to be rulers whereas heavier women may appear to be apples. Skinny women may also assume they are rulers because they don't see themselves as ""curvy"" whereas heavier women may think midsection weight makes them an apple. 

-Generally, side/side measurements versus back/front measurements. The way we tell people to measure their proportions is with a tape measure, getting a 360 degree measurement. An alternate way of assessing body shape is tracing your shape in a mirror or on graph paper. This results in a side-side, front view body type rather than a 360 degree one. Either approach is ultimately limited. If you have a straight up and down torso with a large bust and a round butt, you may not feel like an hourglass or look like one in the mirror (torso does not slope out or in for waist) but you will measure like one. If you have a broad ribcage and hips with a defined waist (common among large framed people who are at their lowest weight) but a flat chest and butt, you could have a very sloped, curvy torso from the front but measure like a ruler. 

The better you understand some of these alternate variables, the better you may understand how your body looks. It can also help in understanding why clothing does or doesn't fit you. I have a small waist but a proportionately large ribcage and was frustrated with poor dress fit throughout my teens until I finally understood it was my underbust and not my waist that caused this issue. While this doesn't necessarily help me find magic dresses for large ribcaged women, it helps me feel less frustrated with my body. 

Measurements can be a source of anxiety but they are also a source of power. In our body image conscious society, many women have frustrations with their body shaped on their experiences. If you went through puberty early, you may always feel like your curves are extreme because they developed early. Looking at your actual measurements may serve as a counterpoint to these sentiments. I often see two women post on FFA with very similar measurements, and one feels she has the perfect body she wants to flaunt whereas another feels like everything is wrong. One's own feelings about one's body are a really important factor when getting dressed, but understanding your measurements and how they shape garment fit can be a helpful reality check. 

I hope people find this a useful starting point in thinking about body shape. I think it can be one useful analytic tool in thinking about how to dress oneself but should never be seen as more than a tool in your arsenal. You may choose to reject it entirely, or determine that a different factor is most important to you when selecting your silhouette.

MFA is like, Fight Club in there: “Sit down, shut up and listen. You’re not fucking special.” 
And FFA, bless us, is like “Hey, you do you, okay? Don’t worry about dem haters. Wear the SHIT out of your 2004 Aeropostale cute little monkeys graphic tee.” Which is a wonderful outlook to have, but ultimately a very destructive one in an advice sub.

After that grievances thread yesterday, which was GLORIOUS, I looked through a lot of old FFA threads and took a good, long look at the comments. There’s a huge tendency on this sub to emphasize the positive beyond all else, to say “Hey, you look great! But change your entire outfit!”. When the OP does get criticized, there’s a tendency to backlash and say that the critic is unfounded and that that Fashion is Subjective.

While it’s true that women’s fashion has much more variety and is far less formulaic than menswear, there are rules. Not rules of “trends” or what’s commonly considered to be “in” – those are subjective and those do change. But rules of aesthetics and color and proportion, rules of how adults should look and dress – those rules either change a lot more slowly, or not at all. Why can we look back at an outfit from 300 years ago and still find it beautiful, even if you’d be ridiculed for wearing it today? Because of color and design and the way those elements relate to each other.

There is no higher fashion authority coming from above to hold you down and prevent you from expressing your special snowflake style. This is a crowdsourced forum of people telling you what they think is or is not stylish.

I get that women tend to have a more adverse relationship to clothes than men. In MFA, we have guys just realizing that fashion is a thing, but in FFA, you have women for whom style has likely meant a lot of different things. We come with body issues and relationship issues and a whole slew of baggage from middle school when we thought we could never, ever be cool. We come from “I’m too fat to dress like her!” to “I could never fill that out!” to “My mom always pushed girly stuff on me and I’m a huge tomboy!” 

At FFA, we’re not your therapist, we’re not your mom, we’re not that creepy dude on the street. We’re here to tell you whether or not your outfit looks good. PERIOD.

Some of those people will tell you that your outfit is ugly. Are you ready for that eventuality? Can you hear that you need to change what you’re doing and go home at the end of the day and still feel okay about yourself? If not, then don’t post.

I think the number one thing that can be done to make FFA a better community is to change the way we do business. Fuck “Oh, but it’s okay because that’s your style sweety!” If we want to see a community go from fucking tragic to a cool forum of decent dressers and good advice like MFA did, we need to be critical. 

There's a LOT more I could say about this but I need to go make grilled cheese and go to work :[

TL;DR You’re here to get criticized. Get ready.

## Part 1

### Introduction

I've seen quite a few posters asking about how to judge fit and proportion. We (currently) have few resources on this sub for teaching someone how to do this, and in general I've found the internet lacking in a guide that goes beyond fit rules to fit theory. So I thought I'd try to write one myself&amp;hellip;

A solid understanding of fit and proportion is usually the first step to dressing well, for the following reasons:

* Being able to evaluate fit allows you to buy pieces that are properly shaped for your body. 
* Being able to evaluate proportions lets you go beyond body type and understand the reasons behind dressing for your shape.
* Developing an eye for fit and proportion lets you break traditional sartorial rules in a way that's still harmonious and aesthetically interesting.
* Being able to articulate what is off in fit and proportion also makes evaluating your own outfits much easier, and your critique of someone *else's* outfit will be much more concrete and useful.

This guide contains some practical tips (find your perfect skirt length! find out when you should belt!) but by and large it's a *theoretical* guide on developing an aesthetic understanding of fit and proportion. 

So, here we go! I hope you find it helpful.

### General philosophies

* **Watch how clothing and accessories create horizontal lines that segment your body into regions**. One of the *greatest challenges* once you get the hang of things that aren't too loose or too tight is observing and understanding how horizontal lines section your body in an unflattering or flattering way.
    * *Changes in item*: the transition from a a shirt to a skirt (say by the hemline of the shirt hanging over the skirt or the shirt being tucked under the waistband of the skirt). The most common kind of segmentation.
    * *Changes in fabric*: [colourblocking](http://media-cache0.pinterest.com/upload/144959681727748249_AvEauNNH_c.jpg) ([via](http://www.vogue.com/collections/pre-fall-2013/thakoon/review/)) (this is a liberal example, as most people would probably call this striped—but it's interesting to note where the lighter and darker stripes hit on the model's body), or the knit of a sweater transitioning from a textured or a smooth knit (textureblocking!) also creates divisions. Here's a textureblocking example with [a knit fabric and leather, both black](http://media-cache-ec5.pinterest.com/upload/74450200061397227_ciaemsGa_b.jpg) ([via](http://pinterest.com/gouree/style/)). Depending on the colours used, colourblocking can be abrupt or subtle as a horizontal division. Textureblocking tends to be rather subtle.
    * *Changes in proportion*: going from boxy and large in shape to slim and fitted—see [this oversized blazer worn with tight](http://www.styleclicker.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Oversized-Blazer-1.jpg) ([via](http://www.styleclicker.net/2011/03/27/oversized-blazer-munich-corneliusstrase/)), or from loose and flowy to fitted (dresses that are cut loose in the bodice with a pencil skirt or body-con skirt, shall we say) also create a horizontal division. Ideally, changes in proportion should follow how the shape of your body changes (swells or tucks in as you go from head to toe).
* **Consider the visual weight (how complex or dominant or heavy) of each item you're wearing**. Also, how that visual weight interacts with the other pieces in your outfit.
    * *Visually complex*: a [textured and embellished jacket](http://marantphiles.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/caroline-de-maigret-wearing-isabel-marant.jpg) ([via](http://marantphiles.com/2012/03/06/the-philes-pfw/)), say, or a very ruffled dress, has a lot of visual detail. It has visual weight because people will naturally be drawn to complex patterns to break them down and synthesize them and understand them. [This outfit contains multiple visually complex elements](http://marantphiles.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/wearing-isabel-marant-didier-pants.jpg) ([via](http://marantphiles.com/2012/02/21/the-philes-12/))—the pattern of the jacket and pants, the shearling texture, the placket of her shirt peeking through, the lacing on her shoes. The muted, harmonious colour palette prevents these elements from clashing.
    * *Visually dominant*: a solid red peacoat has a lot of visual dominance—here, in color. Visually dominant pieces determine how the rest of your outfit is analyzed in relation to that piece. If you have multiple visually dominant pieces, they may potentially be competing for attention—it's good to have few focal points, or focal points of varying importance or position, so a viewer's attention cascades from one attention-grabbing item to more subtle pieces. Note how [this woman's use of bright blue accessories](http://marantphiles.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/wearing-isabel-marant-london-fashion-week-2012.jpg) ([via](http://marantphiles.com/2012/02/24/the-philes-lfw/)) creates a visual path from head to toe, and her clothing is more muted to allow the accessories to shine through. The main argument behind two *very* brightly (and differently) coloured items is that, if they don't appear to relate chromatically—by complementing each other well—having two distinct focal points forces a viewer to split or juggle the object of their attention.
    * *Visually heavy*: mostly refers to volume—a [very thick knitted sweater](http://marantphiles.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/wearing-isabel-marant-12032012-3.png) ([via](http://marantphiles.com/2012/12/03/today-im-wearing-isabel-marant-14/)); or the heel of a wedge, especially an all-black wedge heel; or a [cocoon coat](http://asamatterofstyle.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/hm-cocoon-coat.jpg) ([via](http://asamatterofstyle.com/tag/cocoon-coat/)). Your eye is drawn to and is often caught or pulled to that item's bulk.
* **Notice how tightness/fittedness and looseness/volume affects your shape.**
    * *Tightness/fittedness can create the impression of slenderness or width.* Tightness in areas with little structure (say an overly tight sleeve around your upper arm) makes your flesh looked stuffed in and too wide for the containing garment. Tightness in areas with structure (say tightness around your hipbones) can emphasize shape.
    * *Looseness/volume can create the impression of largeness or smallness*. Looseness to the point of bagginess allows a garment to encompass more volume than your body actually occupies, making you look larger there than you are. But in contrast to more tightly-fitted pieces (slouchy sweaters with slim, fitted pants), it emphasizes the smallness of shape in the tightly-fitted areas. Note how [the voluminous skirt makes her waist and legs look smaller](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vJTux0yplZ0/UKQuwwbhO8I/AAAAAAAABbI/7uZZMVHiSxQ/s1600/hourglass+dress.jpg) ([via](http://thefashionistacoach.blogspot.com/2012/11/q-fashionable-thursday-hourglass-shape.html)).
* **See when visual conflict is a helpful or unhelpful device.** I should note, since I use this terminology a lot, that visual conflict isn't always a bad thing. It tends to be *jarring*, because it subverts what our eye expects. Visual conflict can be used as a deliberate aesthetic decision—contrasting androgynous angularity with a feminine cut in another item, say. [Here it's used in combining bulky streetwear sneakers with a simpler summer look](http://marantphiles.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/wearing-isabel-marant-coachella-part-2.jpg) ([via](http://marantphiles.com/2012/04/25/the-isabel-marant-philes-coachella-2/)), but as the dress retains a kind of stripped-down sportswear aesthetic, the outfit doesn't feel *too* dissonant. Often, however, thoughtlessly introduced visual conflict will feel *wrong* in an outfit.

### The ideal body

* **Most fit and proportion advice assumes a certain body as the ""ideal"" body**. It's a slim hourglass with long legs. Know this, and know how this biases advice to [go towards the ideal](http://youlookfab.com/2006/04/18/the-body-type-%E2%80%9Cbalancing-act%E2%80%9D/):
    * *Slim*: not sure I need to explain this to anyone who's been paying attention to mainstream art and media of the past decade or more. Deconstructing what makes this the ideal body type is beyond this guide. In general: most advice strives to make you look thinner, and cautions against thickening influences. I'll do that too here—largely because this is what people tend to *want*—but if you're going for something different, kep this in mind.
    * *Hourglass*: because symmetry, yo. Advice to deemphasize a large bust, emphasize slim hips, or the reverse intended to ""even out"" the perceived volume between bust and hips.
    * *Long legs*: this is interesting. Not only do models have a torso:leg ratio where the legs are a bit longer, but they tend to have an upper leg:lower leg ratio where the *lower leg* is longer. Something to keep in mind when determining waist positioning for your bottoms and the hem of shorts, dresses, and skirts (that aren't full-length). Going towards this leggy (and lower-leggy) ideal tends to look more pleasing to eyes conditioned by this model look.
* **Don't discard traditional advice on dressing for your body without understanding *why* you're breaking the rules.** Advice towards this ideal body type will still hone your understanding of fit and proportion, and while rules are made to be broken—it's worth knowing the *rationale* behind the rules so you can create outfits with atypical fits and proportions that are still visually beautiful and interesting.",[Guide],False,self,t5_2s8o5,1357103812.0,guide,,True,t3_15sej6,http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/15sej6/guide_understanding_fit_and_proportion_in_an/,

1354893121.0,242,self.femalefashionadvice,14g2pa,"[Discussion] The French Wardrobe thread—how to curate and decide the direction of your wardrobe, in five pieces a season",Schiaparelli,282,40,146,http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/14g2pa/discussion_the_french_wardrobe_threadhow_to/,"## Short version

The French wardrobe philosophy to building and curating your wardrobe revolves around having a core of solid basics and expanding your wardrobe by buying **five pieces a season, no more, ~~no less~~** (edit: less isn't a problem, actually). I and /u/supreme_mugwump mentioned it in the [comments to a post about trend fashion](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/14cjk3/is_it_just_me_or_does_everyone_on_ffa_hate/), and a few people expressed interest in following this philosophy and having a discussion thread about it.

What's there to talk about? Well—

* where we want our wardrobe to be in six months, a year, five years
* making a strategy for how to buy pieces that will lead us to this goal
* figuring out what items are worth investing in as one of our five allotted pieces
* deciding which trends to buy in on and which ones to sit out on
* finding items that complement the rest of your wardrobe
* share anecdotes about things we bought, didn't buy, and so on from a more thoughtful bent than ""Hey, I spent money on this thing""
* talking about the French Wardrobe philosophy as it relates to consumerism, frugality, fast fashion, slow fashion, personal sartorial development

Ladies. (Gentlemen, too.) If you're interested, let's just have a freewheeling chat about the matter. For people new to the idea, continue reading…

***

## The rules

What's a ""piece""? Paraphrased from [here](http://www.paulamontessketchbook.com/2011/11/going-minimalist-5-piece-french-wardrobe/) *(the wording varies from source to source, but the idea is the same)*.

&gt; 1. Fabric and quality is more important than quantity.
&gt; 2. Staple pieces (e.g. a white tee), socks, and underwear don't count.
&gt; 3. Accessories don’t count, except if they cost a lot more than usual.
&gt; 4. Shoes count.
&gt; 5. Everything else counts.

Fashion typically has two seasons: fall/winter and spring/summer, and that's what most people tend to adhere to.

The tricky bit about this is defining what's a ""staple"" and what's not. I'm hoping we can discuss this and figure out among us what are good definitions for these things. ;) 

***

## Why should you follow this?

I first came across the French wardrobe philosophy through [this post on The Fashion Spot](http://forums.thefashionspot.com/showpost.php?p=7137453&amp;postcount=63), which is a **critical read for anyone trying to grow their wardrobe and transform their style in a sensible, sustainable way**, with an eye towards longevity in quality and aesthetic. 

I came across it when I was transitioning out of my ironic Threadless shirt phase and floating in a mire of stylistic confusion. I wasn't sure exactly what I wanted to dress like beyond ""looking good"". I followed Lookbook heavily, so that meant my idea of what I wanted to wear kept on changing with fleeting trends and my wardrobe never quite felt complete. I didn't have a core closet of basics, but I knew I wanted to dress well. I bring this up to argue, at least anecdotally, that **the French Wardrobe philosophy isn't just for people who have a set style. It's useful if you're still evolving.**

**The heart of the French wardrobe philosophy, I feel, is the idea of curating the direction of your wardrobe**. A lot of us haven't been ""fashionable"" or cared about clothing our entire lives. And once we dip our toes into the world of style and fashion, it's easy to let the dissatisfaction with where you are now push to do expand your wardrobe in a haphazard way instead of *growing* it into a cultivated aesthetic.

Reinventing your everyday wear—and, really, how you present yourself to the world aesthetically—is a gradual process, and it can feel glacial when you're looking at hundreds of street style shots online and your taste is now *fantastic* but you still look sloppy every day because your wardrobe and budget haven't caught up yet.

**So many people (myself included) try to move a wardrobe along a better path by buying pieces as individual statements of ""this is how I want to dress"", instead of buying pieces as an overall strategy**. A wardrobe full of quirky, one-off pieces does not a consistent style make. I think a sense of strategy is crucial, especially if you want to dress well on a budget. There's a certain frugality to buying your perfect or near-perfect item *once*, and have it fit perfectly into what you already own, and not having to replace it for a good few years.

One /r/buyitforlife idea I've come across dictates **buying things with the mindset, ""Could this be a heirloom item I could hand down to my son or daughter?""** Admittedly, not every piece can sustain that lifespan and not every person has the budget for it. I certainly don't expect the coats I can buy on a college student budge to last beyond my life. But maybe something in-between will work for many—""Is this an item that the future me will be glad to inherit?""

***

## Final notes

* **Just because it's called the French Wardrobe philosophy doesn't mean you have to emulate the ""French girl style""**. At its core, this is about *how* to buy things, not *what* to buy. Ignore all those lists that require you to have the perfect black cigarette pant and trench if that's not your thing.
* **You don't have to have a huge clothing budget to be able to spend money on quality pieces**. In fact, I'd argue the smaller your budget, the more crucial it is to make quality paramount. And quality doesn't mean ""buy brand/designer items at retail prices"". For me it means ""stalk sales and learn how2eBay"".
* **This isn't anti-trend, but anti-trendyitemsthatyou'llregretlater.** Dude. Buy in on trends if you love them because the selection is great when they're in vogue. Just make sure you aren't buying fast-fashion ripoffs that are cashing in on the look only and not the construction.",,False,self,t5_2s8o5,1355554616.0,,,True,t3_14g2pa,http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/14g2pa/discussion_the_french_wardrobe_threadhow_to/,
1368569747.0,239,self.femalefashionadvice,1ecdsi,Business Casual for Interns and New Hires: Tips and Resources,aktuarie,269,30,60,http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1ecdsi/business_casual_for_interns_and_new_hires_tips/,"I've seen quite a few requests about clothing for internships and new jobs in recent weeks so I thought I’d write up my observations and add a few resources.

First off, I realize this is not a one-size-fits-all topic. I’m writing this from the perspective of the US office I work in – which has a ‘business’ dress code (just short of full suit every day). I know that offices have widely varying dress, but with some changes in fabrics and styles, this guide can be accommodated to almost any dress code. 

If anyone in other countries or with dressier or more casual codes can chime in with additional suggestions that would be awesome!

**Here’s the low-down:**

* **No one really pays much attention to what you’re wearing.** Forget about wearing a different outfit every single day. If you can make ~10 outfits (2 business weeks), you’re good to go without having to do too much laundry.
* **Keep department demographics in mind.** Is your area of the office young and trendy, a mix, or does it skew a bit older? Use this information when you’re considering buying that neon pink blouse.
* **It’s easier to dress down than up.** If you’re feeling pretty clueless about the dress code, it’s better to go a little dressier than you think it will be than risk going too casual. Take off the blazer or roll up your sleeves if needing to look less formal.
* **Fit is more important than price.** And by fit, I mean something probably a bit looser than everyday wear. Pants shouldn’t be glued to your legs, skirts and dresses need to hit close to knee-length while standing, and blouses need to… blouse *(without cleavage)*.
* **LAYERS.** It is shocking how cold an air-conditioned office can be when you’re sitting and permanently damaging your vision staring at spreadsheets. Bring a spare sweater to stash away on your first day.
* **Shop your existing wardrobe first.** Start with that snazzy suit you interviewed in. Maybe you have a couple nice blouses, cardigans, even a dress. Buying a totally new wardrobe for 10 weeks is wasteful of beer money if you’re not completely sure you’ll wear the items again. For new grads – don’t spend your bonus until you have other things like furniture under control, and you’ve fully evaluated the dress code environment.
* **Walking shoes.** You may think you’re ace at bar hopping in heels, but if you’ll be in a walking city like Chicago or New York, for the sake of your feet and the sake of your shoes, please buy a comfortable pair of flats for walking to and from work. Get a tote (also useful for brown bagging that lunch) and keep your heels in there.

**Guideline wardrobe**

* 2-3 pairs of dress pants *(look for dressy fabrics that feel silky/smooth, generally avoid chinos/khakis)*
* 2-3 skirts *(at least 1 of these should be a neutral colored pencil skirt)*
* 2-3 dresses *(wrap dresses and sheaths look good on most figures)*
* 5-7 blouses *(button-downs, shells, light sweaters, etc)*
* 2-3 cardigans *(at least one in a neutral)*
* 1 blazer
* 1 pair heels *(closed-toe and 3 inches or less is a good idea)*
* 1 pair of dress flats
* 1 pair of walking shoes *(avoid: Crocs, bright colors. I have a pair of black [Skechers GoWalks](http://www.amazon.com/Skechers-Womens-Walk-Slip-On-Black/dp/B0058XJ5PA/))*

If you’re awesome and can make everything mix and match, the minimums will honestly last you throughout the summer with few repeats.

**Shopping Resources:**

Buying basic pieces like a suit, pants, skirt, and sheath dress is worth investing a bit more than other pieces because of their versatility and the amount of wear they’ll get *(but if it’s not in your budget, it’s totally cool and it will be fine, see the next paragraph)*. I’m a big fan of [The Limited](http://www.thelimited.com/), but [Nordstrom](http://shop.nordstrom.com/c/womens-clothing-wear-to-work-shop), [LOFT](http://www.loft.com/loft/catalog/category.jsp?catid=catl000019&amp;supCat=catl00002), [Ann Taylor](http://www.anntaylor.com/ann/editorial/AT-Lookbook/ANN-Wear-To-Work/cata000059), [J Crew](http://www.jcrew.com/womens_special_shops/weartoworkshop.jsp), [White House Black Market](http://www.whitehouseblackmarket.com/store/browse/shelf.jsp?cat=Workkit&amp;catId=cat6219285), [Banana Republic](http://bananarepublic.gap.com/browse/division.do?cid=5002), and sometimes [Express](http://www.express.com/clothing/Women/Suit+Shop/cat/cat290005) are all good places to look for these pieces.

For blouses, cardigans, shoes, and accessories, less investment is necessary, particularly if you want trendier colors and prints. Stores like [Forever 21](http://www.forever21.com/Product/Main.aspx?br=f21) and [H&amp;amp;M](http://www.hm.com/us/department/LADIES) can be good, but pay very close attention to washing instructions, fit, and how sturdy the seams are. It may not usually be your cuppa tea, but stores like [JCPenney](http://www.jcpenney.com/dotcom/women/dept.jump?id=dept20000013) and [Kohl’s](http://www.kohls.com/sale-event/women.jsp?CN=3000000103) have some pretty decent business clothing at pretty good prices. Thrift shops can also have nice business clothes for cheap. Make sure to check for pilling, ripped seams, stains *(check the armpits!)*, shoulder pads, and snags.

If you have a couple of weeks and want to get really good deals, I’ve had a lot of success with [Hukkster](http://www.hukkster.com). It’s easy to use and it will give you e-mail alerts when the items you’ve set up go on sale.

**Wardrobe cleaning and care**

Try to find machine wash items as much as possible. Tumble dry is also a bonus, but always do it on low! If you're using a commercial dryer, these items may be better off hung to dry. Some items like blazers and nicer skirts and pants will be dry clean only. This does not need to cost you a fortune with a little extra attention. In general, you can wear almost everything multiple times before washing/dry cleaning if you're good about putting clothes on a hook or hanging up right after taking it off. Here are some good guidelines:

* Pants and skirts - 5-6 times
* Blazers can go even longer between dry cleaning - 12-15 wears, perhaps longer if it's getting minimal pit contact.
* Dresses - 2-3 times (more like 1-2 in the summer when it's boiling)
* Sweaters/Cardigans used as layering item - 5-6 times
* Blouses - 1-2 times *(unless you're a magical unicorn who doesn't perspire from your armpits)*",[Guide],False,self,t5_2s8o5,1368638671.0,guide,,True,t3_1ecdsi,http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1ecdsi/business_casual_for_interns_and_new_hires_tips/,

Spring/summer edition, with a recap of the last thread!",Schiaparelli,246,29,293,http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/15yf1z/the_french_wardrobe_thread_2curating_a_wardrobe/,"## So what's this French Wardrobe business?

The French wardrobe philosophy to building and curating your wardrobe revolves around having a core of solid basics and expanding your wardrobe by buying **no more than five pieces a season** (a season defined as fall/winter and spring/summer—two per year). The idea behind it is to help you grow your wardrobe and transform your style in a sensible, sustainable way, with an eye towards longevity in quality and aesthetic. It asks you to **curate your wardrobe—expand with thought and care and towards your stylistic goals, and shop in a strategic fashion**. It's a great philosophy to consider both if you're just starting to build a ""fashionable"" wardrobe or if you're well into developing your personal style. 

If you're new to the idea, read the [first thread on the subject](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/14g2pa/discussion_the_french_wardrobe_threadhow_to/) for an introduction (start at the heading: ""Why should you follow this?""). We had some *excellent* thoughts in the comments—see the end of this post for the greatest hits from last time!

Now that it's 2013 and we're moving into S/S, it seems like a pretty good time to revisit this idea, reopen discussion for the new members of our sub, and chat about:

* *Temporally relevant*: 
    * your resolutions for 2013 and how they might tie into this philosophy
    * your plans for the five spring/summer pieces you might buy (share ideas for good basics and pieces!)
* *Always relevant*:
    * how to begin building a wardrobe and curate its direction
    * making a buying strategy for our wardrobe (stylistically? cohesively? financially?)
    * how to judge quality and utility of an item you want to buy
    * figuring out what items are worth investing in as one of our five allotted pieces
    * share anecdotes about things we bought, didn't buy, and so on from a more thoughtful bent than ""Hey, I spent money on this thing""
    * talking about the French Wardrobe philosophy as it relates to consumerism, frugality, fast fashion, slow fashion, personal sartorial development

Ladies. (Gentlemen, too.) What are your grand plans and specific plans for your wardrobe? Any questions or tips to share?

## The French Wardrobe rules

Paraphrased from [here](http://www.paulamontessketchbook.com/2011/11/going-minimalist-5-piece-french-wardrobe/) *(the wording varies from source to source, but the idea is the same)*.

&gt; 1. Fabric and quality is more important than quantity.
&gt; 2. Staple pieces (e.g. a white tee), socks, and underwear don't count.
&gt; 3. Accessories don’t count, except if they cost a lot more than usual.
&gt; 4. Shoes count.
&gt; 5. Everything else counts.

Fashion typically has two seasons: fall/winter and spring/summer, and that's what I encourage you to adhere to. The tricky bit about this, of course, is defining what's a ""staple"" and what's not. Staple items are usually quite personal depending on one's style and needs.

## Frequently expressed concerns

* **Just because it's called the French Wardrobe philosophy doesn't mean you have to emulate the ""French style""**. At its core, this is about *how* to buy things, not *what* to buy. Ignore all those lists that require you to have the perfect trench if that's not your thing.
* **You don't have to have a huge clothing budget to be able to spend money on quality pieces**. In fact, I'd argue the smaller your budget, the more crucial it is to make quality and carefully considered buying paramount. MFA had a great thread recently on [how to afford to dress well](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/15ae3h/how_can_you_guys_afford_to_dress_well/), and many commenters expressed French Wardrobe-esque ideas: buy less, buy slowly, do less with more. *(And, of course: thrifting and eBaying and obsessive sales stalking.)*
* **This isn't anti-trend, but anti-trendyitemsthatyou'llregretlater**. Buy in on trends if you love them, because the selection is great when things in vogue. Just make sure you aren't buying fast-fashion ripoffs that are cashing in on the *look* only and not the *construction*.

## Greatest hits from the last time around

/u/zeoliet on her [purchasing strategy to find the most useful pieces for you and buying without regrets](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/14g2pa/discussion_the_french_wardrobe_threadhow_to/c7cwzhq)—

&gt; The most important part is that the process takes weeks or more for me, that's why I call it a strategy and not just ""shopping"".
&gt;
&gt; 1. **Item Inspiration**. I've decided I want something. Perhaps it's from a blog or I just realized I had a hole. This item goes in my shopping list. My shopping list is with me at all times…*This list is specific!* For example I would write ""navy crewneck sweater"" rather than just sweater. Items have to be valid to my wardrobe before they even go on the list (fill a gap or be a replacement).
&gt; 2. **Wait and Consider**. Every time I am getting dressed and think ""I really wish I had…"", I make a mental note of it. If I see a person in an item I know is on my list, I make a note of it.
&gt; 3. **Evaluate the list**. Typically when I'm adding a new item, I look at the rest of my list. While I usually have a pretty good idea of what's on my list, sometimes I forget things. It's a good chance to cross off things I'm really not hyped about anymore. Perhaps I added a new item to the list and it negates an old item. Clean the list up. My list stays under 15 items including accessories.
&gt; 4.  **Window Shop**…Being extremely harsh in the dressing room is IMPORTANT to me. It must fit, be a good material, and be interesting in some way. Window shopping also includes surfing the internet as well as trying things on. Sometimes I try it on and love it, but I leave it there so that I can think about it. Sometimes the item is forgettable, and I move on. I also try on items outside of what I think my size should be, if I'm unsure of the brand's sizing (one size up or down)…
&gt; 5.	**Make the deal**. Weeks or months later…I've finally found the perfect version of the item. Perhaps I tried it on previously and can't get it out of my head. I am completely committed to this item now. I usually wear it the next day, because I've already thought about how I want to wear it and all the many ways I could make it work.
	
/u/julzzrocks on [translating styles you like to a list of pieces you need](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/14g2pa/discussion_the_french_wardrobe_threadhow_to/c7ctmqs)—

&gt; The first step, I think, is to make a list of the pieces you'll need the most to achieve a certain aesthetic. For instance, if you're looking at inspiration pictures, you can identify a common element…Take that one item, and find the one that's perfect for you…Don't go for the first one, or even the second, and give yourself an ample budget by cutting back on other clothing purchases.
&gt;
&gt; Basically, I would say isolate the pieces that would MOST bring the look together, then focus on peripheral ones. For instance, you can create a kind of aesthetic if you were to buy basic pieces you love, and which fit the aesthetic, and just a couple of must-have pieces that tie it together.

/u/maneating_cats on [defining her style for a cohesive, easy-to-shop-for wardrobe](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/14g2pa/discussion_the_french_wardrobe_threadhow_to/c7ctehl)

&gt; What helped me define my style was to pick a person whose style I loved, pick apart what I liked about their style, and distill it into a formula…I made a sort of uniform for myself from that. I know it sounds very rigid and formulaic and derivative, but it's worked wonderfully. I now have a small, cohesive wardrobe of classics I love and wear constantly…It's also made shopping less stressful—I don't feel pressured to try and consider everything and anything that looks good…sounds boring but it's helped calm down my materialistic urges. And I'm at the point where I don't feel like I really need or want more clothes, so it's worked.

/u/cass314's [list strategy on figuring out what items to buy](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/14g2pa/discussion_the_french_wardrobe_threadhow_to/c7cse73):

&gt; I have a small list, and every time I'm getting dressed…if I put together half an outfit and realize it doesn't work, but would work with ""x"", I write x down.
&gt; 
&gt; Eventually, the things that I really ought to consider adding become very clear because I've written them down a dozen times. The other caveat is that unless it's on ""the list"", I can't buy it when I'm out and about.

/u/DJGlowTryk on [the difference between interesting pieces and the pieces that are right for *you*](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/14g2pa/discussion_the_french_wardrobe_threadhow_to/c7cto2f)

&gt; I think it is important to acknowledge the difference between something that you like, and something that is a good fit for your aesthetic…
&gt; 
&gt; When I started, it was really hard for me because I bought a ton of stuff that I liked, but had a hard time working in with the pieces I already had. Gradually I was able to figure out a more coherent vision of how I wanted to look, and I could appreciate the items that were beautiful but not for me…Seeing something on yourself is a really important step. Find stores that have a good return policy so that you can take things home and see how they look with what you already own. An amazing top that you have to buy pants and shoes for is maybe not such an amazing top.

First, I will talk about who needs a suit, followed by the components of a suit, followed by fit, followed by dated rules, followed by where and how to purchase a suit. I will then touch upon appropriate hair, makeup, and accessories for an interview. 

A suit is a uniform. Through wearing a suit, you: 1) show your employer or interviewee respect 2) show you can present yourself in a professional way 3) wear something neutral and nondistracting so your interviewer can focus on your skills and accomplishments, not your mint chevron nails.  As a result, this section is going to be more proscriptive than the other days, and than FFA generally is. 
A good suit should make you feel [badass and powerful]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7aDstrDMf0)  (though save the short skirt for after work). It should not make you feel like you are wearing your mom’s clothes.  

**Do I Need a Suit?**

If you are interviewing for office jobs on the East Coast, South, or Midwest, or hope to work in law or finance, you need a suit. If you are in academia, I would highly recommend a suit for conferences and interviews.  One rule of thumb is that if you would ever wear a suit on the job, you need a suit for the interview. I have many friends who work in nonprofits and philanthropy in my conservative mid Atlantic city. They can wear jeans and nice sweaters to work. However, they are expected to wear suits once or twice a year, for presentations to the board and to donors.  It would be highly recommended to wear a suit for their interviews.  It’s better to err on the side of too formal than too casual, especially for an interview. 

If you have an interview that you don’t need a suit for, or cannot afford a suit for, I’ll be covering nonsuiting interview wear in tomorrow’s post on business casual. 

**Components of a Woman’s Suit**

A woman’s suit typically has two pieces. First, there is a suit jacket, which must fit at the shoulders. The suit jacket can have 1-3 buttons, and the rules about number of buttons are less strict than in men’s fashion. 

Second, there is a suit bottom. This can be a pair of slacks, or a straight or pencil skirt. Sometimes manufacturers also make a-line skirt suits, but these are currently hard to find.

A suit variant is a [sheath dress]( http://www.lordandtaylor.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/en/lord-and-taylor/sleeveless-sheath-dress-0225-m9rb7901--1) made of suiting fabric, coupled with a suit jacket in the identical fabric. For very formal (corporate law, finance, big three consulting) interviews, it might be better to stick to a more traditional suit, but for most interviews, this is a valid option.

**Under the Suit**

Under your suit, you can wear a cotton button up shirt (Brooks Brothers often makes good ones, I also used to have good luck with Express), a silk or modal button up shirt (I recommend Everlane or Equipment—pick up Equipment on Ebay to save $$) or a [shell]( https://www.google.com/search?q=suiting+shells&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4rTZUYHbFPOx4APzzIC4Cw&amp;ved=0CEAQsAQ&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=667). A shell is typically sleeveless and closefitting. If you wear a shell to the office, you are committing to not take your suit jacket off as sleeveless clothing is usually inappropriate. In less formal offices, you may be able to wear colorful, patterned blouses under your suits (cue: men wear colorful ties or bright/pastel shirts), or even plain tee shirts (cue: men don’t always wear ties). 

For an interview, you should wear a button up or shell – white or blue are the safest colors. If you aren’t sure you need to wear a suit and think it may be overkill, you can pair it with a more casual top. Just make sure you don’t distract from what you are saying through your clothes. 

If you are busty, you may struggle with button ups. One solution is to buy button ups that fit your shoulders and bust and have the waist tailored. If your bust is bigger than your shoulders, button ups may not work for you as it is expensive to have shoulders tailored and you will need to find a good tailor. If a button up just gaps a tiny bit in the chest, like when you raise your arms, you can sew a small snap or hook between the buttons over the bust. I find silk and modal button ups accommodate my bust better than cotton because there is more drape. 

**Fit**

For a traditional office, a suit should always have a tailored fit, not tight or oversized. It is RARE to find a suit that fits off the rack with no alterations, and most women will need to factor alterations into their suit cost. Petite and tall women should look for lines that have options for them to minimize fit issues. Good fit is really key to looking powerful and awesome in a suit instead of frumpy. 

Suit tops and bottoms should almost always be sold as separates. Don’t be alarmed if you are very different sizes on top and on bottom.  I’m usually around a two in suit bottoms and an eight in suit jackets and have a pretty typical hourglass shape. 

If you are very slim, you may want to look at Theory suits in specific because they run a bit smaller than other brands. Also, look at Japanese manufacturers. I don’t know very much about plus sized suits but if anyone can make recommendations, I’ll update this.

If your hips are large relative to your waist or you have a bubble butt, you should buy your suit to fit your hips/butt and get the waist taken in. My mother used to tell me a suit skirt should never fit so that the skirt followed the curve under the butt [like this]( http://heres-looking-like-you-kid.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/dg-pencil-skirt-side-view.jpg) but if you have a full booty, this may not be realistic, and that’s ok. Just make sure the skirt isn’t pulling over your butt.

If you are busty, you may find suit jackets pull a lot between the bust and the top button. When people post suit fit pics on FFA this is the most common mistake I notice. You can fix this by sizing up and tailoring, or, especially if you have narrow shoulders, looking for a suit that has a single button that buttons lower rather than one high button or a classic three button. [Hard for busty people]( http://www.yoox.com/us/women/shoponline?gclid=cjgztsignrgcfdkj4aodh2aasg&amp;tp=40539&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=shopping_us#/textsearch=armani+collezioni&amp;dept=women&amp;gender=D&amp;page=1)  [or] (http://www1.macys.com/shop/product/calvin-klein-jacket-stretch-one-button?ID=371065 ) [better for busty people]( http://compare.ebay.com/like/370837373655?var=lv&amp;ltyp=AllFixedPriceItemTypes&amp;var=sbar) [or]( http://compare.ebay.com/like/130937455232?var=lv&amp;ltyp=AllFixedPriceItemTypes&amp;var=sbar) The lower fastening placement can also elongate the torso because it creates an extended V shape. 

A skirt or dress for an interview should generally hit around your knees. If you are very tall, and your skirt is two inches above your knee, don’t sweat it, but avoid going shorter than that. 

**Dated Rules/Things You Can Choose Whether to Pay Attention To**

You may have heard a skirt suit is preferable for interviews. When our mothers were entering the workforce, this was certainly true. Now, if you were being interviewed at a top law firm by a partner over 70, it might also be a good rule of thumb. For 99% of interviews, though, I don’t think a skirt suit or a pantsuit makes a difference. I like my legs, and feel more confident in a skirt suit, so tend to always interview in skirts just to be safe. However, if you are not comfortable in skirts or find pants fit you better, don’t wear a skirt suit just because someone told you it was important.

In men’s businesswear, black suits are considered less appropriate for interviews because they are seen as more formal and only suitable for funerals. This connotation is less strong in women’s fashion. The ideal suit interview color is probably grey, but if you look better or prefer navy or black, go for it.  Once you get a job, you can wear brown or khaki (in the summer) suiting if you prefer. White may also be acceptable in the summer in many workplaces—I have fantasies about a winter white suit in the future but I may need to improve my hand eye coordination first to improve its life expectancy.  In the south, seersucker and colorful suits may also be appropriate. 

Pantyhose: Some people believe you should always wear pantyhose to an interview, some think that is dated. I always do unless it’s over 80 degrees (my city is a swamp in the summer) because frankly, they are cheap and it’s not a big deal. Your pantyhose can be ‘nude to you’ and closely match your skin tone, or either match your shoes or your skirt. (Grey suit, black hose, black suits or grey suit, grey hose, black shoes are both fine.)

Interviewer is male or female. This should not affect your interview attire. Ever. Unless part of your job is looking sexy, don’t wear sexy clothes to an interview. Give men more respect than thinking they will hire an interviewee they find sexy, and give women more respect than thinking they will be jealous of an attractive interviewee. Also remember that many men aren’t attracted to women and many women are! This really should NEVER be a factor. 

**Where to Purchase a Suit/ But suits are so fucking expensive**

Purchasing a suit is can be an undertaking, and is best done with advance notice. If you are a junior in college entering a field where you will need a suit, I recommend beginning the process now. 

I’ve had success with suits from Banana Republic, which has a petite and tall line. Ann Taylor and J Crew are also mall brands which produce decent suits.  Look for the big sales at all three (usually in January and August) to cut down on the price.

Talbots and Brooks Brothers may cater to a different age demographic, but are worth checking out. 

Big department stores are a great place to look for suits because they will have many different brands you can try on to see what cuts work for you, whereas the mall brands may just offer 3-4 suit variations at a time. My favorite suiting comes from Tahari and Theory. 

Suits are really expensive, I know. If I were to outline an ideal suit purchasing strategy for someone who had several months, it would look like this:

1)	Go to a major mall and try on all the suits in all the department stores. Make notes on brand and size you like.

2)	Set up ebay alerts for all the suits you like.

3)	Purchase the components of your ideal suit from ebay for a steal.

4)	Try it on and get it altered.

Notes:

1)	If you like skirts and pants, please consider purchasing both the skirt and pant options when buying a suit jacket. It may be hard to find the right match in the future and it’s a false economy to only purchase one option.  It’s going to be winter, and you are going to wish you had pants that matched your suit jacket.

2)	Take good care of your suits. A really good suit that is covered in lint and wrinkled looks likes crap whereas a cheap suit that is cleaned and ironed can look good.

3)	If you have a last minute interview and need a suit, see if you can borrow one from a friend.

**Interview Shoes, Jewelry, Hair and Makeup**

You should wear neutral colored shoes for an interview that coordinate with your suit. They should not be open toe or patent leather (no shine). If they’d look cute at a club, they aren’t interview appropriate. No platforms and the shoes should be almond shaped. 

I prefer to wear a pair of black pumps. Standard interview recommended heel high is 3 inches and mine are 4—some people feel higher pumps are too sexy for an interview, but as long as no other detail is sexy, I think it’s ok. 

It is FINE not to wear heels for an interview, regardless of your height. In fact, if you are unconfident walking in heels, don’t wear them for an interview. Wedges are too casual to pair with suits but may be ok for less formal interviews. Plain neutral flats work well with skirt suits. Oxfords or loafers can pair with pant suits.

Jewelry and makeup should be simple and non-distracting. I like pearl studs because they draw light to the face, but if you aren’t a pearl studs/diamond studs kind of person, that’s fine, just nothing too big or dangly. 

You don’t need to wear makeup for an interview if you never wear makeup. In any case, go fairly light on the makeup, and eyeshadow should be neutral colored. No false lashes or winged eyeliner and be cautious with bright lipstick. 

Your hair should be flattering and professional. A French braid is ok, but avoid side braids or romantic hairstyles. A bun or a half pullback works well, but down is also fine if you prefer that. In my early 20s, I used to feel it was inappropriate to wear my hair curly for interviews, but  I think it’s fine to embrace your natural texture. 

Tomorrow, I'll be discussing business casual dress codes.

&gt;[I] am a little suspicious of 'the fashion world' in general when it comes to race, in that there seems to be a tacit agreement that black guys can pull off a lot of things that white guys can't. This attitude seems at least somewhat grounded in notions of black men as more street, masculine and cool, which in turn is a reflection of racism in society, and stereotypes of black men as gangbangers, thugs, etc. ... And I think that is more than a little problematic, if not outright racist in some cases, but it is probably an aspect of race which none of us can escape, since it's so ingrained in our culture (and American culture in particular).

There's a lot to unpack here, but I think it's worthwhile for us to have a conversation about fashion and race, both on the everyday level as well as reflecting on the fashion industry as a whole.  I'm curious about FFA's opinions on fashion and race and any intersection of the two, particularly in light of the fact that [we are disproportionately white and Asian](http://imgur.com/eO4eK9L,VOWgPdP#eO4eK9L) compared to other races and ethnicities.

Some starting points to consider:

* [the ""invisible knapsack""](http://ted.coe.wayne.edu/ele3600/mcintosh.html) of white privilege.  In fashion, this might include things like *nude* meaning ""white skin-toned,"" the ease of finding makeup for lighter skin, even the original color of Band-Aids.

* whether certain races can ""pull off"" a look/item that other races can't, due to issues of authenticity or aesthetics

* the whitewashing of non-white female models, such as choosing black models with primarily ""white"" features or digitally lightening their skin

* the relative lack of Asians in the high-fashion industry",[Fashion Discussion],False,self,t5_2s8o5,False,discuss,mod,True,t3_1c4wyi,http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1c4wyi/fashion_and_race/,

A lot of other stores will make clothes exclusively for regular sizes and exclusively for plus sizes.

This album is of similar size, and once again, I tried to keep things interesting and diverse: street fashion, cosplayers, visual kei, lolitas, decora, gyaru, etc. The majority of these images are also from the fashion districts in Tokyo such as Harajuku, Shibuya, and Shinjuku.

As far as street fashion is concerned, hopefully this album exemplifies some of what is currently ""in"" right now, for example: printed tights, platform shoes, bright dyed hair, and pannier skirts. Many of these pieces are homemade and many are purchased from small designer shops throughout Japan. Much like male fashion in Japan, female fashion is characterized by heavy layering, interesting silhouettes, and a willingness to experiment with just about anything.

Anyways, I hope you all enjoy this album! Feel free to discuss what you do and don't like about any of these looks.

I know there is such a sub as /r/FrugalFemaleFashion, but it isn't very active, and people here seem to be interested in getting things for sub-MSRP. I think it would be cool to have a recurring thread for DON'T MISS THIS deals. This could mean sale items, or sweet Ebay listings, or really nice Twice finds.

I always come across good stuff on Twice or Ebay that isn't my size or my style or just not on my to-buy list at the moment. Or sometimes I'm browsing sales and find a sweet item on DEEP DISCOUNT that I know someone would appreciate, even if they're out of my size or I just don't need it.

This is for *specific* items on sale anywhere or sales at lesser-known stores that people would not have been likely to find otherwise without a lot of effort. Unless it's just a super-awesome deal, try to keep to in-season or a long-term investment pieces. It's not that hard to find good end-of-season deals. (That said, if you know where I can get a nice one-piece swimsuit in a tall, I'm all ears.)

I'll start:

[Brown Silk Fendi dress](https://www.liketwice.com/item/dresses/fendi/2052315733) -- Twice, $375, IT46 (approx US8) -- I know nothing about Fendi except name recognition and that it's hella expensive, but I am looking for a bridesmaid dress approximately this color, and this is lovely. If it were my size, it would be mine. 

SOLD OUT ~~[Gap 1969 Denim Jacket](http://www.gap.com/browse/product.do?cid=65180&amp;vid=1&amp;pid=351546002) -- ~$24 with code GAP24HR (regular price $70) -- size S only (ends 8/14, marked down to $35.99 otherwise)~~

[True &amp; Co. lingerie](https://trueandco.com/) is having a sale. They have an interesting algorithm by which they suggest bras for you and they have an at-home-try-on program like Warby Parker for bras. I'm trying it for the first time, so I am not endorsing, just informing. Lots of bras for ~50% off.

ETA:

[Land's End Canvas Merino Crew Pullover](http://www.landsend.com/products/womens-merino-wool-open-crewneck/id_252859)-- ~$25 with code FLOWER/pin 8125 -- available in navy, grey, and olive -- XS, S, ~~L~~ depending on color

According to the sidebar I’m a slim hourglass, but because of my height, nega-boobs, and shoulder width, I’m visually a rectangle or banana. Fashion Magazines, online fashion blogs, and sometimes commentators on FFA refer to my body type as “boyish”. I hate, hate, hate, hate it. I am a girl. I am not a boyish girl. My girlishness is not reduced by my body. To be a girl I don’t need to “create the illusion of curves.” I don’t need to wear skater dresses or waify, oversized sweaters. My femininity is not the product of my curves or lack thereof. I am a girl because I identify as a girl. I am feminine as fuck whether I’m in gym shorts or totally naked.  

Using the word “boyish” to describe a woman subtly denies her femininity and even questions her gender identity. As a cis-girl, people don’t question my gender identity that often, and it doesn't actually affect my life when they do. People still call me Ms. instead of Mr.  Even if I get pissed off at the phrase “real women have curves”, I’m never in physical danger because I don’t appear to be a “real woman”. 

However, a lot of transwomen (especially transwomen who don’t want/can’t afford hormone therapy) are also a rectangle body type, with wider shoulders, small breasts, and slim hips. Even though you probably don't intend it, using the word “boyish” to describe their bodies is insulting and problematic. To a transgirl, “boyish”,  reflects a world where her femininity is doubted, shamed, or made into a joke. “Boyish” reminds her that her gender identity is only validated if she can “pass” as a cis-girl. And if she’s too “boyish”--if her appearance doesn’t pass as feminine enough--[she could be a target for violence.](http://msmagazine.com/blog/2011/08/10/hate-crimes-against-transgender-women-raise-questions/)

EDIT:
I think that in my original post my tone came off as accusatory, and I've been advised to edit it. To clarify: I don't want to start censoring the word boyish--that's ridiculous. I don't think ""boyish"" is a slur. I just want to start a discussion. I don't think the people who use the word boyish are using it maliciously. I don't think people are even aware that they used it. I just wanted to point out that a fairly ordinary word can be hurtful, because it reflects a larger social context. 

The words we use influence the way we categorize and perceive the world. Right now there is a tendency to prescribe gender based on bodies, rather than identities or presentations. Using the word ""boyish"" to describe people who don't identify as boys reflects and strengthens this problematic system.

1351787704.0,186,self.femalefashionadvice,12gpwx,A Beginner's Guide to Business Casual,nothingsong,214,28,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/12gpwx/a_beginners_guide_to_business_casual/,"Business casual is sometimes cited as the most common type of dress code in American workplaces.  It is vital to learn how to wear business casual when you are in college or looking for a job -- the more you can incorporate it into your everyday style, the more put-together and adult you will look compared to peers who wear hoodies and t-shirts.  It isn't fun or glamorous, but neither is working 9-5.

***When to Wear Business Casual?*** 

Most white-collar workplaces fall into this dress code, though they may vary in emphasizing ‘business’ or ‘casual.’  Teaching is a perfect example of a job that almost always leans to the formal side.  Working in a small office or retail store usually leans to the informal side.  (Always err on the side of formality if you aren’t sure what to wear.)  Business casual is also a safe bet for most job fairs, meetings, and orientations depending on your field.  It can also be acceptable in many informal interviews, such as for a retail job or volunteer position, but if you are in any doubt as to what you should wear, ask your host, supervisor, or interviewer ahead of time for the dress code – it’s always fine to ask.


***What to Wear?***

As a rule, business casual means neutral, clean, and conservative, but with considerable room for interpretation from one workplace to another.  Look for pieces with modest cuts (no cleavage, no thighs, sometimes no shoulders), largely neutral colors/patterns, and a minimum of casual elements such as buckles and embellishments.  While parts of your outfit might be more formal and others more casual, as long as they are combined correctly you should be OK.  Tackling each part of the outfit separately here:


**Tops**

* Most blouses and tailored shirts are fine in any color so long as the prints and materials are not overtly casual.  For example, this [collared shirt](http://i.imgur.com/uxmgM.jpg) is fine, but this [flannel one](http://i.imgur.com/wrzr2.jpg) is generally not.

* Plain shirts may have crewnecks or scoopnecks, but avoid halter tops and tube tops (is that even a thing anymore?).  [V-necks](http://i.imgur.com/z1wBX.jpg) are fine but watch out for cleavage – wear a cami underneath if it might be an issue.  Try not to wear anything sexy, overly tight, or [sheer](http://i.imgur.com/NbI2Z.jpg).

* [Sweaters](http://i.imgur.com/ifr5B.jpg) and [cardigans](http://i.imgur.com/7Dv7X.jpg) are great but avoid sweaters with [informal prints](http://i.imgur.com/JYoyB.jpg) or trendy cuts on the [back](http://i.imgur.com/ZLlOd.jpg) and [sleeves](http://i.imgur.com/UbJU8.jpg).


**Jackets and Outerwear**

This probably varies based on your climate.  I live in Philadelphia which is pretty temperate, so I’ll give my opinion for my area.  Neutral blazers, peacoats, trenchcoats are fine, but I would generally avoid coats like [windbreakers](http://i.imgur.com/6LNeE.jpg), fleece (I’m looking at you, [North Face](http://i.imgur.com/mtqCS.jpg) sorority girls), [anoraks](http://i.imgur.com/tiSPh.jpg), [big puffy coats](http://i.imgur.com/bRCan.jpg) and [parkas](http://i.imgur.com/o3im5.jpg) because they tend to have extra embellishments, look casual, and often come in less neutral colors.  However, in this category function trumps everything.  If it is cold enough to warrant a parka, then wear it – you won’t be wearing it inside anyway.  Just keep the colors reasonable.


**Bottoms**

* Khakis and straight-leg trousers in black, brown, tan, white, navy, and grey are always a safe bet but watch out for the cut.  Stick with straight leg or boot cut if at all possible, since ~~flared,~~ skinny, and boyfriend cuts can range from too trendy to too casual.  **Edit**:  Commenters have pointed out that pants with a flare can be ideal on athletic body types.

* Leggings as pants are never okay, and be careful with print and color when wearing leggings or tights under dresses -- keep it neutral.

* [Capris](http://i.imgur.com/AzjMS.jpg) in the summer are usually OK but check around your workplace first.  It's not glamorous but if it's hot, you'll be glad to wear them.

* For skirts and dresses, err on the side of conservative or knee-length – definitely nothing above fingertip length when standing straight.  Pantyhose seems to be a regional thing and more common in conservative workplaces.  It is not necessary, but a safe option if you aren’t sure.

* [Dark wash straight jeans](http://i.imgur.com/cYvRZ.jpg) are becoming more and more acceptable in BC, but it is by no means universal – think about how rarely you saw your teachers wearing jeans (we’ll get to Casual Fridays in a minute).


**Shoes**

* Pumps, wedges, and flats are almost universally acceptable styles.

* Ankle boots can be fine but this really depends on the material and embellishments – [this one](http://i.imgur.com/LYJ7Q.jpg) is probably okay, [this one](http://i.imgur.com/4Qg0h.jpg) is definitely not okay no matter what.  (Note that it's not just the color, but also the material, distressing, and lacing detail).

* While it may be possible to wear mid-calf or knee-high boots in a business setting, it is hard to make them look anything but casual – I would avoid it.  If you have to wear rainboots or snowboots due to weather, leave a pair of alternate shoes at your workplace to change into.

* As a rule, avoid sneakers, sandals, flip-flops, combat boots, ~~loafers~~, moccasins, and heels above 3” unless you are sure they’re OK.


**Accessories**

This one is hard to mess up.  Anything is pretty much fine in moderation as long as you keep the tone neutral.  I would avoid things like chunky knit scarves and legwarmers, only because they look a little trendy and juvenile if the rest of your outfit is a notch more formal.

* Wear makeup sparingly.

* Don’t wear too much jewelry – I find that one necklace, one bracelet, and one ring is more than enough.  A good watch is an excellent addition to most outfits.

* As far as tattoos:  my visible tattoos have never been an issue, but YMMV on that one.  If ever in doubt, cover them up with your clothes or makeup and ask about the policy before you show them.  (Dermablend can hide most tattoos, and you can test it out at Sephora.)


***Casual Fridays***

Also known as dress-down days, this doesn't necessarily mean that you can come to work in a tank top and shorts.  It means that you can dress one notch of formality lower than your everyday dress.  If the standard is pencil skirts and blazers, you can get away with trousers and a blouse on Casual Friday.  If your workplace doesn't permit jeans during the week, that means that dark wash, straight leg jeans are probably fine on Casual Friday.  No matter what, dress sensibly.  Don't wear anything that would make you feel uncomfortable talking to your boss.

***Some Outfits*** (feel free to link me to some more, I’m on my work computer so I don't have any to cite)

* [Knee-length pencil skirt, blouse, scarf, and pumps](http://i.imgur.com/n9rWN.jpg)
* [The current Banana Republic lineup](http://i.imgur.com/jfFzi.jpg).  Note the cut of the shirts and length of skirts/dresses.
* [More Banana Republic](http://i.imgur.com/MlNNH.jpg)
* [This has been cited in the comments as a business casual outfit with knee-high boots](http://i.imgur.com/3ovb5.jpg)


***Where to Buy?***

You can find acceptable pieces almost anywhere, including trendier places like Zara or H&amp;M.  However, some stores like Banana Republic, Ann Taylor or Ann Taylor LOFT, and J. Crew cater to this dress code almost exclusively.  Department stores like Macy’s, Nordstrom’s, and Kohl’s will all have business casual wear in addition to casual clothing.  Avoid places like Urban Outfitters and Forever 21.  Even if you could find acceptable pieces from those stores, the lack of quality would probably be noticeable.  It’s worth spending more for basic pieces that you will wear over and over, like a decent blazer and pumps.

And there’s no easy answer because adulthood means different things and styles are subjective, etc etc etc. 

**How do I look put together and adult, you ask?**

*But work with me here: there’s a really simple answer to this.* If you’re currently wearing jeans and sneakers and a hoodie and are wondering how to look just a little more put together and mature, just take everything one step farther – just a little more simple, a little more streamlined, a bit more formal. 

**So If You’re Wearing, Try:**

**Sneakers or Espadrilles** ([Toms](http://images.toms.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/side/900x640/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/w/-/w-ash-canvas-classics-s-su12_1.jpg), [Chucks](http://static.musiciansfriend.com/derivates/19/001/219/755/DV020_Jpg_Jumbo_421543.005_red_pair_R.jpg), athletic shoes)
	**Try**: simple black ballet [flats](http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/img-thing?.out=jpg&amp;size=l&amp;tid=335497) (*Avoid unneccesary embellishments like bows, straps, or logos*)

Why it's better: black ballet flats make the foot look smaller and narrower, letting the eye rest elsewhere on your outfit. They go with almsot everything and can be dressed up or down.

**Jeans** (*[Bootcut,](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DSZUrIVVASg/TWNMp1iW3NI/AAAAAAAABng/O9UHaRyPu98/s640/Bootcut2.png) flare, [lightwash](http://blog.denimtherapy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/light-wash-jeans-spring-3.jpg), baggy, [jeggings](http://www.denimology.com/2009/07/Sienna_Miller_Jeggings-denim-leggings-Bondi_beach_JT-1.jpg))*
**Try:** [Slim cut or skinny](http://www.aloharag.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/0/1/01_22_8.jpg) (not legging) in the darkest wash available: no [whiskering](http://www.youindie.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/levis-501-1947-custom-cropped-denim-1.jpg), [pocket detailing](http://cheaptruereligionmen.us/Public/Uploads/Products/detailgallery/CHEAP-TRUE-RELIGION-JEANS-267.jpg), etc.

Why it's Better: Dark denim elongates the leg, and the slim fit prevents [breaking](http://www.primermagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/PantsFit/PantsFit_Breaks.jpg) which can shorten the leg. Whiskering and other embellishments are generally considered tacky and no longer stylish.

**Jeans** (*slim cut, dark denim*)
	**Try:** playing with fabrics – [corduroy](http://medias.camaieu.fr/images_produits/load1288x1500/471479_5896_f.jpg), [wool](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-B4Iike3Hbyc/Tp4v8oWJtdI/AAAAAAAAAmw/sQHOCDRPjGQ/s1600/071610_minnie_m.jpg), [chino](http://www.zigoti.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/how-to-wear-chinos-for-women.jpg)

Why it's Better: While dark denim is versatile, corduroy, wool and chino are generally more formal and can be dressed up for a nice dinner or, in the case of wool, work. Colored pants are trendy, but keep the hues saturated and dark to maintain the elongated effect of dark denim.

**Hoodies** (*of the baggy[ pullover variety](http://i.ebayimg.com/t/Fashion-Korean-Style-Womens-Thick-Baggy-Hoodie-Zipper-Loose-Coat-Outerwear-/00/s/NzAxWDcwMQ==/$\(KGrHqZ,!iQF!9nH1I+8BQf5s2H!qw~~60_35.JPG) or the [zip-up variety](http://fashionlovespeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/american_apparel_hoodie.png)*)
	**Try**: A [cardigan](http://www.piperlime.com/products/res/mainimg/classic-cashmere-cardigan-citron.jpg) or a pull over sweater - but if you go anywhere near it with a belt I will find you and shame you publically.

Why it's Better: Cardigans and sweaters generally hug the body in a more flattering way than hoodies and are appropriate for weekends, church, and work. Extremely versatile.

**A graphic[ t-shirt:](http://www.cityfarmer.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/growtshirt.jpg)**
	**Try:** a plain v-neck [shirt](http://www.coastalfarm.com/images/Carhartt_Women_s_Short_Sleeve_V_Neck_T_Shirt_WK098CNB.jpg)

Why it's Better: Expressing ones views through graphics on a shirt is generally considered juvenile - your personality should be expressed through your behavior and general ideas of your clothing, not outwardly expressed. V Neck shirts are simple and can be worn as a base layer or on their own. 

**Clearly this is overly simplistic and narrow. If anyone can think of anything to add, please let me know and I will add it. Obviously this is the most basic guide humanely known to man for the most basic beginner. And it’s written by yours truly, so the skew is preppy.

1374313465.0,188,self.femalefashionadvice,1ios54,I purged my wardrobe and learned a lot,Eau_de_Zazoom,216,28,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1ios54/i_purged_my_wardrobe_and_learned_a_lot/,"I'm a pretty new poster here and I am working on building a better wardrobe. I was inspired by a couple recent posts to finally purge my wardrobe and it was a really worthwhile exercise, so I thought I'd share a bit of what I learned. I ended up getting rid of roughly a quarter of the clothes I started out with and am left with mostly basics. You can see the clothes I kept and examples of what I purged [here.](http://imgur.com/a/cqL7D) I'm in Australia so that is why there are so many tank tops.
I learned that:


 * Most importantly, I have been making clothes unwearable simply though poor storage. If you look at the album I've linked you'll see pretty much all of the pieces are wrinkled! I was horrified, I couldn't believe I hadn't noticed how bad it was. Part of the problem was I had stuff really crammed into drawers and things that should have been hung up were crumpled in drawers. Another factor was that I have a bad habit of leaving dry clothes in the clothes basket where wrinkles get set in. Finally, I don't own an iron! Once I cleared a bunch of clothes out, the clothes I am keeping fit much better in the drawers and I could hang up more clothes on our rack. Still need to buy an iron though...


 * Many of the tops I was getting rid of were the same shape, triangular. It just looks weird! Now I know to avoid that shape when I see it in shops, as I am more of a rectangle/hourglass.


 * For the most part I am happy with the colours of my clothes; most of the clothes I got rid of I was really happy with how they looked! My main issue was fit. I am about 5'10"" and about 125 lbs so many things are too short for me, or the torsos are too loose. I thought I was picky already, turns out I should be even more so.


 * I already know that high-waisted pants and shorts look better on me, but less than half of my bottoms are high waisted. Similarly I think I look better in boat-neck tops but they are a minority in my wardrobe. 


 * Most of my clothes are pretty old! A lot of them are 5years+ meaning that I bought them back in high school/early university (I'm 24 now). I like to think I've changed since then but my clothes haven't. Over half of what I got rid of is not in good enough condition to give to a second hand shop due to pilling, stretching, and just general visible wear. 


 * Over the years, to avoid getting rid of tops I like, I have been relegating them to sleep/lounge wear. As a result I had over 20 pieces of pajama pants, ratty tops, etc. Considering I was only keeping about 45 pieces of day clothing, having 1/3 of my clothes being for sleep seemed excessive! I mean I know we spend 1/3 of our lives sleeping but really, it was time to bite the bullet on some of those pieces. 


 * Many of the things I was keeping were things that I thought I could fix. This was stupid because I don't own a sewing machine and I'm terrible at sewing anyway. I wouldn't get these clothes tailored for the most part because they were so cheap to begin with it wouldn't be worth the expense.  


By cleaning out my wardrobe I learned more about what I have that's working and what isn't. I learned to pay more attention to caring for my clothes and replacing them when necessary. And it helped me to get my priorities in line- I need more evening clothes since I got rid of basically all of them. I also need more work and business appropriate clothes (I thought I had some good work trousers but it turns out I don't-good thing I found that out now and not the day before an interview!). These are all things I've read about as common issues, but seeing them in person really drove the message home. In short, A++ would purge again!

The spectrum can include everything from suiting seperates, to slacks and nice blouses, to chinos and khakis with t-shirts. On the bright side, business casual provides people with more obvious opportunity to express creativity than business formal, and people who want to wear a “uniform” to work can still create one.

In this guide, I’ll start some general guidelines for work attire that should also be applicable in less formal offices. I will then list types of clothing that could comprise a business casual wardrobe. I’ll comment briefly on interview attire in less formal offices and on how to shop for business casual. Finally, in the comments section, I’ll give four 20 piece business casual capsule example wardrobes. These are not intended to be prescriptive but may provide a jumping off point for the new and the bored to think about making a business casual wardrobe that works for them.

**Basic Guidelines**
Work clothes should always be clean and not ripped or distressed (worn looking denim has some good applications but is not office appropriate). Very tight clothing and cleavage aren’t appropriate, and one should tread carefully with sheer tops, even if they are worn over other pieces. Skirts should never be more than four inches above the knee, and two is a safer guideline. Sleeveless garments aren’t appropriate in most offices, although they are fine when paired with cardigans or jackets. If you wouldn’t wear it to meet your SO’s parents for the first time, it probably isn’t ok for work.

**Factors Affecting Outfit Formality**
Several factors make a garment appear more or less formal. These factors include: structure, color and fabric. Throughout this guide, I will describe clothing choices as risker or safer. A safer choice is appropriate in most offices, regardless of what it is paired with. A riskier choice may be appropriate in a smaller number of offices, or it’s safety may depend what it is paired with. How risky or safe you choose to be is not just dependent on your office environment but also on how comfortable you are with clothing that may stand out. I really like my clothing to stand out in my non-work life, but in the work place, I want to make sure I get remembered by my work product and ideas first. (If I worked in fashion or any other creative industry I might feel like the two were more closely linked!) 

 In most business casual environments, you can play with one or two of these factors. For instance, if you want to play with bright colors or brights, you can stay within an office feel by wearing a chartreuse pencil skirt. If you want to wear a swingy, pleated midi skirt, you might be able to make it appropriate by purchasing it in navy and pairing it with a tucked in white OCBD. A printed, colorful, A line dress is hard to make office appropriate, even if it is modest, because neither the structure nor the color feels like businesss-wear. In contrast, a print sheath dress or a black a-line dress may work in many business casual offices.

**An Attempt at History**
One confusing thing may be that men’s office fashion and formal event fashion are very similar, whereas they are very different for women. Why don’t women wear ballgowns and cocktail dresses to the office, or pencil skirts with nice blouses to weddings?

My understanding is that our concept of what women’s work clothing is derives from World War II. Women’s fashion during that time emphasizing appearing strong and non-frivolous, a trend that was fueled both by actual shortages and the desire to share in the war effort through a singleness of purpose. As men (and some women) left for the two fronts, more women entered the workforce than ever before. As a result, the fashions that were dominant during that time shaped our conception of what is appropriate for a working woman to wear. When boomer babies entered the work place, they drew inspiration from this era. 

**Types of Clothing That Could Be Part of a Business Casual Wardrobe**
Pants: Everything from traditional suiting pants, to trousers, to khakis, to chinos. The most office appropriate cuts are trouser, straight leg, or wide leg. Hem pants to go with either heels or flats, whatever you wear more often, but make sure the hem on a wide leg or trouser pant ends 0.5ish” from the floor, not above the ankle. 

Crop pants (like the estimated jcrew mini): most crop pants are very fitted so may be less office appropriate. If people wear jeans in your office or skinny-cut pants, they are probably fine. If in doubt, go with a neutral color. 

Skirts: Should be around knee length, give or take two inches (taller people can take an extra inch or two). Pencil skirts are the most traditional office cut, but be careful to confuse [pencil]( https://www.google.com/search?q=pencil+skirt&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QubcUabPA_ej4AOuv4H4Ag&amp;ved=0CAkQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=667#facrc=_&amp;imgdii=_&amp;imgrc=4g79C_LMSbyldM%3A%3BQmxaR5nk1t5WEM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Ffreshionable.com%252Fwp-content%252Fuploads%252F2013%252F03%252FBlack-Pencil-Skirt_Front.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Ffreshionable.com%252Fproduct%252Fblack-pencil-skirt%252F%3B900%3B1350) [skirts]( https://www.google.com/search?q=pencil+skirt&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QubcUabPA_ej4AOuv4H4Ag&amp;ved=0CAkQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=667#facrc=_&amp;imgdii=_&amp;imgrc=Hr9_DYPO7mYNGM%3A%3BBBOA1gsRbYzjWM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fcoralsandcognacs.com%252Fwp-content%252Fuploads%252F2013%252F02%252Fjcrew-pencil-skirt.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fcoralsandcognacs.com%252F2013%252F03%252Fpencil-skirt-style-tips.html%3B750%3B617) with [bodycon](https://www.google.com/search?q=bodycon&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xebcUcvQMoTC4AOQkIDoDw&amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=667#tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=bodycon+skirt&amp;oq=bodycon+skirt&amp;gs_l=img.3..0l10.13511.14232.0.14327.6.4.0.2.2.0.58.220.4.4.0...0.0.0..1c.1.17.img.mBjZ8vHxQ6Q&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.48705608,d.dmg&amp;fp=a5a58958e5a185bb&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=667&amp;facrc=_&amp;imgdii=_&amp;imgrc=potaJvQlxAvNgM%3A%3BaMpZVPeMB6HAsM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fbodyconskirt.net%252Fwp-content%252Fuploads%252F2012%252F01%252FMiso-Body-Con-Skirt-at-Wome_std.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fbodyconskirt.net%252F%3B465%3B460) [skirts]( http://www.wetseal.com/catalog/product.jsp?productId=64133&amp;zmam=33862506&amp;zmas=1&amp;zmac=39&amp;zmap=48018982_RED_L&amp;gclid=CM-syaaPpLgCFc2j4AodKggAcA). A pencil skirt is tailored and has some structure by itself, a bodycon skirt is stretchy and your body gives it its shape. A line skirts are fine for the office, but may be harder to find in office appropriate styles and cuts.

Dresses: Sheath dresses are a no-brainer, but wrap dresses (watch out for cleavage), shift dresses (if long enough), and a-line dresses can also work well.  Sweater dresses may also work in less formal offices. Just remember to bring something to cover bare arms and shoulders. If a dress has cut outs, or a sheer back, it isn’t appropriate for the office, and putting a blazer on won’t fix that.

Cardigans: an easy ‘third layer’ for office outfits, can be layered over plain t-shirts and tanks to make office appropriate. Open front cardigans can look a little sloppy (less structure than regular cardigans).

Blazers and jackets: easily make an outfit look more formal. Avoid jackets with visible hardwear. Avoid leather unless people are allowed to wear jeans. It’s bad to rely on any piece of clothing to save an outfit, but blazers add structure and formality and can do a lot for a blah top with the ghost of a mustard stain and a skirt that fit better six months ago. 

Tops: you have the most flexibility here. Some button ups in cotton, silk, modal or polyster are helpful. I would also recommend some sweaters both for layering and by themselves—a sweater can look a little less stiff than a button down with a pencil skirt in a more casual office. Tops are also the easiest place to inject color into your wardrobe.  T-shirts can be all right as layering pieces in casual offices (and in an in-between office, a  drapey t-shirt under a suit can look amazing) but avoid graphic tees and very thick tees.

Shoes: Pumps, flats, oxfords, loafers, ankle boots and riding boots are all options. Some color through your shoe may be all right but avoid very trendy  and loud colors (neon or mint are very risky whereas oxblood could work). Avoid platforms and very high heels. Wedges are ok, but avoid espadrilles or anything that looks beachy. It can be hard to wear knee high boots with a skirt to the office without imparting an overly sexy look, but it can work if you pair the boots with tights in the same color rather than bare legs.

**Shopping for Business Casual**
You can find business casual clothing at most department stores, Banana Republic, Gap, Ann Taylor, Ann Taylor Loft, J crew, J Crew factory, The Limited, Express, Talbots, and Brooks Brothers. Boden can be helpful for work appropriate dresses and you may be able to pick up inexpensive blouses at Target. 

If you’d like to thrift for your business casual clothes and live in or near a city, I’d recommend checking out thrift shops near yuppie neighborhoods.

If you are trying to figure out how to allocate a budget for business casual clothing, you should spend the most on shoes, because quality makes the biggest difference for shoe durability and your foot comfort and health. Blazers  and bottoms should be the next most expensive, and it’s worth investing in tailoring. Tops and cardigans are the best place to save—look at the sale rack of Ann Taylor and BR during January and August sales and try on everything in a color you like in your size. 

**Interviewing**
Let’s say you have an interview with a company where everyone wears jeans. To make a good impression for the interview, you should step up one degree in formality. That means you should follow a variation on the following formal:

Business casual bottom+ business casual top +third layer (blazer or cardigan). 

The third layer makes it look a bit more formal and pulled together. Avoid anything uber trendy unless it’s a fashion or creative related industry. The rule of thumb for clothing retail interviews is to wear clothing *like* the clothing sold in the store, but on the more dressy side of the spectrum they offer.

**Four Sample Business Casual Wardrobes**

(I don't really understand Pinterest or Polyvore but if anyone has free time and wants to try to make style boards for these four cases I'm happy to help.)

*A doesn’t want to wear skirts or dresses or pieces with ruffles. She’s most comfortable in jeans and hoodies and thinks cardigans are fussy. She likes neutrals and earthtones.* 

1 interview pantsuit (pants and jacket) in grey/1 pair slacks in black/2 pairs chinos, khaki and grey/Dark wash jeans for Fridays and casual days/2 v neck sweaters in black and navy or olive green/1 crew neck sweater in marled grey/5 button up shirts in white, navy, green, etc. consider subtle pinstriping or bolder stripes for more visual detail/3 tee shirts in white and black  and maybe maroon/1 pair oxfords in black/1 pair ankle boots in cognac

These pieces are low-fuss items that could also be in a man’s business casual wardrobe and are fairly timeless.

*L loves color and likes the mid 60s office looks on Mad Man and wants to look appropriate for the office without feeling stiff.*

One interview skirt suit in navy/ 2 pencil skirts  in bright, solid colors (mustard yellow, cobalt, purple…)/One neutral colored sheath dress (two tone light and dark grey?)/One brightly colored sheath dress/1 white silk button up/1 white blouse with a bow or ruffle/1 black blouse/2 colorful blouses/2 cardigans, one neutral, one bright/1 boat neck sweater /1 v neck sweater/2 pairs pumps in black and nude/1 pair flats or [low heels](https://www.google.com/search?q=ferragamo+vara&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kPXcUaKwMPG54AP57YCoBQ&amp;ved=0CAkQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=667)

If I were L I would buy all these items in similar color tones like[this]( https://www.google.com/search?q=a+line+skirt+in+cobalt+with+black+blazer&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4OfcUcKTEfan4APWsoDoBg&amp;ved=0CAkQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=667#tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=color+swatch+clear+winter&amp;oq=color+swatch+clear+winter&amp;gs_l=img.3...250326.254095.3.254219.25.24.0.1.1.0.90.1367.23.23.0...0.0.0..1c.1.17.img.K_KJvUSWiEg&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;fp=a5a58958e5a185bb&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=667&amp;facrc=_&amp;imgdii=_&amp;imgrc=5op6gma4hHd_xM%3A%3B3xww7mpmsUs13M%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.collegefashion.net%252Fwp-content%252Fuploads%252F2008%252F09%252Fdeep-winter.png%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.collegefashion.net%252Ffashion-tips%252Fhow-to-find-your-perfect-colors%252F%3B222%3B42) so I could wear a lot of color without worrying about what piece went with what and feeling limited in my combinations. 

*H is a former college swimmer with narrow hips and a full bust line. She feels she doesn’t look good in pencil skirts and button ups usually don’t fit. She likes to shop at Anthropologie and Ruche.*

1 black blazer with a low v neck/black wide leg pants/grey wide leg pants—could also go with trouser-jeans in a more casual office/three patterned A-line skirts  (may already be Anthro buys in her wardrobe)/one brightly colored a-line skirt/one wrap dress/one a-line dress with a subtle pattern or texture/3 cardigans, each of which matches a neutral or dark color  in each of the patterned skirts/5 v neck, sleeveless tops in neutral colors/one pair ankle boots/one pair oxfords

H is able to avoid button ups by pairing sleeveless shirts with cardigans. She keeps color on her lower half  to balance out her torso.  She also can wear more whimsical prints to the office by pairing them with neutral pieces on her top half. 

*S really wants to get promoted but is the most junior person in her office by seven years. She wishes everyone would forget she wasn’t even alive when the Challenger exploded.  She’s working a lot of hours and doesn’t have a lot of time to think about her outfits. She wants a work clothes formula and doesn’t care about being creative or expressing herself*

Grey interview suit, with pant and skirt option/black slacks/black blazer/black and grey tweed pencil skirt/dark burgundy pencil skirt/OCBDs in white, light blue, grey, and a pinstripe/silk blouses in white and blue/black cardigan/v neck sweater/2 white shells/ black pumps (or nude if preferred)/ black flats

This list allows for the creation of more suiting-like looks (matching bottom and third layer) in a business casual office. The items should pair well together necessitating less coordination.

1342032451.0,184,self.femalefashionadvice,wecf1,By Request: How and When to Belt,FFA_Moderator,209,25,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/wecf1/by_request_how_and_when_to_belt/,"Ah, the waist belt. The scourge of our generation. The bane of my existence. Something to be feared and abhorred—but respected when done right.

This is a guide on how and when to belt.

First things first: there are regular belts, which sit at the waist hem of your pants (typically resting inside your belt loops), and there are waist belts, which sit considerably higher on your waist.

**Regular belts**

Regular belts should be worn when you are wearing pants with a medium-to-low rise and your shirt is tucked in (half or full). ([Example](http://i.imgur.com/bNupb.jpg))

You should **not** wear a regular belt with pants that have a special type of closure:

* [Drawstring](http://i.imgur.com/2lZjn.jpg)

* [Ties](http://i.imgur.com/lLgKH.jpg)

* [Special buttons](http://i.imgur.com/rgxOv.jpg)

* [Foldover hems](http://i.imgur.com/nWBpO.jpg)

Also, sometimes people have an inexplicable and horrendous desire to use [regular belts over dresses](http://i.imgur.com/OFF5J.jpg). Don’t do this. If the dress has a dropwaist hem, let it be. If it doesn’t, you are destroying its silhouette and drape.

And please, for the love of god, don’t do [this](http://i.imgur.com/ALiYV.jpg).

**Waist belts**

Waist belts are a different animal, entirely. 

Waist belts should fall at the waist of your bottoms (whether they be [high waisted pants](http://i.imgur.com/EkaBQ.jpg), [high waisted shorts](http://i.imgur.com/edFNr.jpg), or [skirts](http://i.imgur.com/bgnD8.jpg)).

There are also many different ways to tie waist belts to make them interesting:

* [1](http://i.imgur.com/O7vwF.jpg)

* [2](http://i.imgur.com/JY9bq.jpg)

* [3](http://i.imgur.com/bvA4O.jpg)

* [With the right length and rigidity, they can peek out of outerwear](http://i.imgur.com/K41eh.jpg)

* [Some belts are extra long to allow for double wrapping](http://i.imgur.com/DAEHd.jpg)

DO’s

* Waist belts should typically be [thinner than a regular belt](http://i.imgur.com/aIBq7.png).

* [Waist belts should be used for contrastive purposes where a top and bottom (skirt or pants) meet](http://i.imgur.com/DuwaE.jpg)

* Waist belts should be used with [dresses that have a built-in waistline](http://i.imgur.com/W04aK.jpg)

DON’T’s

* DO NOT belt sleek dresses, particularly [body con dresses]( http://i.imgur.com/aW7vi.jpg) and [jersey maxi dresses]( http://i.imgur.com/2skow.jpg).

* [Oversized waist belts](http://i.imgur.com/r3kb5.jpg) are almost never flattering

* Do NOT belt [empire waist/babydoll dresses](http://i.imgur.com/jjj3g.jpg). This is hugely unflattering for your boobs and your stomach, and is often incongruous with the natural waist of the dress (notice how in this example dress, the waistline moves upward into a triangle toward the center of the dress—will not go with a straight-across belt)

* [Belting over outerwear](http://i.imgur.com/RLxus.jpg) is incredibly risky and almost never looks good. [Bad](http://i.imgur.com/cX6Fy.jpg), [bad]( http://i.imgur.com/IX4Wr.jpg), [okay—and this is Olivia Palermo; if she can’t pull it off all the time, us mortals don’t have a chance](http://i.imgur.com/9aXwn.jpg). It works better with [structured outerwear]( http://i.imgur.com/ZXvRf.jpg), and not so well with cardigans. Because of the softness and drape of cardigans, the belt doesn’t sit right and tugs at the silhouette.

* DO NOT wear waist belts with regular length shirts. [It looks very bad and unnecessary](http://i.imgur.com/YkItd.jpg). You do not need [a belt with your t-shirt](http://i.imgur.com/gqbtv.jpg).

*****

Obviously, these rules can be bent and broken by people with a good eye and experience, but for a beginner, belts ain’t nothin ta fuck wit.

When done well, they can provide contrast and structure to a garment. When done poorly, they are nothing but disruptive and unnecessary.

Most outfits will look just as good, if not better, without a waist belt.

http://imgur.com/a/PluMT


I entered a list of every item I own into a spreadsheet.  Then I noted if I wear it often or not and, if not, the reason why not.  For example, i have a beautiful blouse I rarely rare because I can't be bothered to iron it *blush**


Then I pivoted to see how many items I wear often.  Shockingly, only one-third of my wardrobe is frequently used.  The other two-thirds are stagnant.  Pretty poor.


Next I pivoted on my proposed solutions.  What are my main culprits?  For me, it is mostly not knowing how to style an item.  

My second biggest reason is simply not wearing an item that I like because it is 'too nice'  :p  I am 'saving' them for nicer occasions - which is pretty silly really!


Now I am going to work my way through my proposed solutions list to hopefully maximise my wardrobe.  I want to see more versatility in my clothes so that I don't have things sitting around doing nothing :)

This is highly recommended as a useful activity if you're like me and have a wardrobe full of clothes but nothing to wear!


Oh... those 10 pieces I'm not sure how to style?  I hope it's okay if I make a post about those and ask for help!

While researching around for my summer shopping list, I found quite a few pieces I thought would be nice to share with FFA. This is an experimental post—I'm not quite sure how valuable and worthwhile sharing a shopping list is, but I always find *tons* of cool stuff I can't afford to buy/stuff that doesn't match what I already own, and I'd like to share it in case someone else wants to pick these things up. And maybe it's a nice introduction to different design elements people can look for.

There's an assortment of twee/minimalist/classic styles, and quite a bit of floral things because *it's spring/summer and florals are everywhere*. The format looks something like this:

Anywho, I'm in the process of trying to break out of my tomboy appearance and actually look like a girl. My style comes from being raised in an all-male home (two brothers and dad), plus hiding my body due to fear of sexual attention (past trauma and shit). I'll run down the list of things listed in the sidebar post. 

**Height:** 5'4""

**Weight:** ^^^200 ^^^pounds ._.

**Age:** 26 years old

**Body type:** Spoon

**Why:** After eight months of some serious DBT, having great sessions with a wonderful therapist, and making huge changes in my life, I'm ready to be what *I* want to be, and not dress and act in a way that protects me from the world. I don't want to be controlled by my fears. While I feel like a new person on the inside, I don't feel like it on the outside. Still wearing baggy men's tshirts and jeans. I brush my hair once a day, if that. I just want my outside to reflect the change I've undergone inside. After shopping with the mom-in-law today for a coat, I realized I have NO idea how to shop for women's clothes. It was a nightmare, just horrible. 

**You now:** Baggy men's graphic tshirts (I know, shoot me). Men's or women's jeans, whatever fits me and whatever is cheap. Sneakers as well. I used to wear skirts when I was going through this Pentecostal phase because I was in the pastor's pants. They're not very effective now. I live in Wisconsin, and do not like a frigid draft grazing my roast beef lips. It should be said that I'm all about function, and not fashion. Bewtz wit da furrr kinda make me mad, since they have no traction and are not waterproof. 

**You after:** Very neutral. I don't like loud, I don't like prints or patterns, I don't like bright, flashy things. I'm soft, quiet and boring. Earth tones make me happy. I found some pictures that might suit this-

http://i.imgur.com/I45Sh.jpg

Even looking at this stuff feels so foreign. 

**Budget:** I don't have any money now, but in about a month or so, after I start work, I intend on having a $600 budget to get some kind of wardrobe going on. 

**Pictures:** Ugh... ._.

http://i.imgur.com/PPTv6.jpg

http://i.imgur.com/7KDJu.jpg

**Hair:** It would be nice if I could get any advice on a nice, boring hairstyle that takes little to no maintenance. It's shortly below shoulder length right now. It won't grow any more. Haven't had a hair cut since I was 10, no joke. My hair's a little wavy, I think. 

Thank you all for taking the time to read my post, and I really do appreciate any advice you could give me. I really, really have no clue what I'm doing. I won't be able to reply for a little while soon, since I gotta cook supper, but I live on the computer. Thank you again. 

**EDIT:** Trying to reply to everyone. Just got done cooking, and the husband a little distracting. I will do my best though! Thank you again, everyone, I really appreciate your words and advice. 

**EDIT 2:** Words are starting to run together. Imma take a break from replying. Thank you again. :3

**EDIT 3:** Back at it!

**EDIT 4:** Oooooooh I think I'm done for the day. Man, my brain hurts. I have learned the art of looking like a lady. Not as complicated as I thought it'd be! Thank you so much to everyone who has put forth time and effort to reply to me, offer advice, compliments and everything! It is so appreciated and warming! I'll get back to replying tomorrow.

This has lead to an unsurprising rise in the number of guys coming in to share in the advice giving. Which is great; anyone who can present valid critique, assistance, or discussion is an asset here. But here's the thing: it doesn't matter that a particular piece of advice is coming from a guy or girl, straight or LBGTQ.

Fun fact: two of us mods are men. And hell, one of us (i.e not me) is by far one of the best, most knowledgeable sources of advice here. But our advice is neither better nor worse because we are guys.

Opinions and knowledge on style are built and grown independent of gender and orientation. Any person is capable of studying and learning the do's and don'ts of color, texture, silhouettes, fits, and overall fashion trends.

And lets be honest, most posts asking for ""a guy's opinion"", or posts starting with ""I'm a guy and I think..."" are based on the idea that sexual orientation (not gender) makes someone a better judge of what looks good. But innate sexual preference doesn't automatically make someone a useful point of guidance to learning what is sartorially ""attractive"".

Putting particular wight to an opinion because of the source's gender or orientation is not really that different from weighting you grandparents' clothing advice more heavily because you want their approval. The appeal is understandable to a certain extent, but it doesn't give any additional weight to its validity.

The sad fact is that, at the end of the day, most people have no idea what they are talking about. Anyone who has watched FFA evolve will be able to attest to that. The quality of advice, mainly to be judged on the history of previous advice, is going to be far and away the best way to judge the merit of an opinion if you're not able to make that judgement entirely yourself. But it surely isn't gender or orientation.

TL;DR: Don't worry about (and in the same vein we don't care about) the gender or orientation of a source of advice, critique, or discussion.

*EDIT for even more clarity*: If you're a guy, there is no reason to announce it to the world here, it doesn't change your opinion's weight. And in the same vein, there is no need to seek, nor dismiss, the opinion of someone just because of their gender or sexual preference.",[Announcement],False,self,t5_2s8o5,1346089486.0,announce,vag,True,t3_ywj49,http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/ywj49/on_the_subject_of_the_weight_of_mens_opinions_in/,moderator

Well, she loves to shop at Abercrombie/American Eagle/Etc. She has her own personal ""style"" and is doing pretty good. She said she wants to go to a fashion school for college here in Georgia (but she also wanted to be a vet, princess and horse back rider so, you know, we'll see).  That said, I want to encourage her interests. For Christmas I'd like to get her a nice ""fashion"" related gift. 

I've considered taking her to Nordstrom's and getting her a personal fashion assistant but the cost is prohibitive.

I know JCrew has something similar but it is also expensive. 

(Edit: The stores are expensive, the shopper programs are free...sorry, I wasn't clear)

I thought about getting her subscriptions to Vogue and/or InStyle but that's not much of a Christmas (""Here kid, have a magazine, Merry Holidays or something."")

What is the best way to teach my daughter ""fashion"" without breaking the bank? Is there a way I could learn along with her and make it a good father/daughter thing? I get her every other weekend so it needs to fit that schedule. Also we live in Atlanta, north of the city and in walking distance of a decent mall, if that helps.

Apologies if I offend or am asking poor questions. My only knowledge of fashion is that I found ""tall"" t-shirts on Amazon for cheap this month and got kinda ""giggidy"" about it.

Edit: Answers so far are books, classes and interesting local designer arts from Etsy. Such wonderful ideas. Questions so far are: is she into clothes or fashion. Well poo. I have no way of telling. She runs hot and cold on her interests. Except for boys. She's hot for boys and romance and drama. Being a dad is hard.

Edit 2: There are so many great answers here! Wow! Thank you to everyone who shared their thoughts, kind words and links. I don't know what proper etiquette is in this sub but I felt compelled to respond to everyone that took the time to help me. I have a ton to go on now. If you continue to get ideas please don't hesitate to share. I will post here once I decide what to do! Fortunately I have almost a month. LOL. 

Edit 3: Thanks again to everyone. I took some time this morning to review everyone's feedback and thoughts. Ugh. This is all so confusing but I think, based on my non-scientific study, that I'm going to:

1. Get a stack of magazines from the bookstore and let her go through them to find the ones she likes in the comfort of her own home then get her a subscription if she wants one.
2. Get a few of the books that were recommended (I haven't decided which ones but one with drawing and one with just fashion/style)
3. Skip the sewing machine ""this"" year and see if she's interested next year
4. Look for some opportunities to go to a runway show. Love this idea!
5. Get her a personal shopper (after the holidays) at either or both JCrew and Nordstroms. Hmm...now that I think about it maybe she and a couple of her besties could have a sleep over then after breakfast I could take them over and they could do it together! 
6. Look for a class of some sort for us
7. Work on being interested in what she's looking at rather than just facilitating. Wow. That's going to be tough.

Thanks to everyone. You've all been great! Even the folks that got downvoted were providing thoughts that had value. Hey, I'm just a clueless dad who turned to the Reddit hive mind. We can't all agree but it was amazing to see how many of you turned out to help. I am truly touched.

The moderation team has been hard at work, looking for ways to improve the way we enable the community to do what it wants to do. Aside from some very interesting projects (shout-out to /u/thethirdsilence for her impressive undertaking with her [Officewear and Interview Series](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1ht3r2/officewear_and_interview_series/)), we're introducing some changes to the way things have been done in FFA.

**New Recurring Threads**

*Theme WAYWT* - /u/catterfly has been running this for a while, but we'd like to clarify a few things about them. The announcement thread will be posted on Thursdays to both FFA and MFA - if you see a bunch of male participation, that's why! They're intended to be challenges for both communities, but are hosted on FFA. While the announcement of the theme is on Thursdays, the actual submission threads are on Tuesdays. The flair for each post reflects this - [Announcement] for the announcement threads and [Submission] for the submission threads.

*Random Fashion Thoughts* - /u/dwindling has taken it upon herself to post Random Fashion Thoughts every Wednesday. This can be whatever you're thinking about but don't necessarily feel like creating a standalone post for - want to post a WSheWT? Really interested in a certain stylistic direction or designer at the moment? This is a great way to learn more and share dribs and drabs of thoughts.

*Fit Check Thread* - In an attempt to cut down on ""FFA, how does this fit?"" and ""FFA, do these pieces go together?"" threads, we've instituted  a weekly Fit Check thread to be posted every Thursday. This differs from WAYWT in that it's designed specifically for outfits you have questions about or directly want feedback on - note, however, that you may still receive constructive criticism in WAYWT threads.

*Need/Want/Love* - Buh-bye, Should I or Shouldn't I! Saturdays will now play host to a Need/Want/Love thread, for users to share both what they are practically interested in (particularly useful for those trying to follow the ""French Wardrobe"" philosophy), what you want (can still serve the same function as Should I or Should I), and what you're loving - it can be something from Pinterest, Polyvore, the runway, or just a piece that you think is beautiful but would never wear.

**New Schedule**

With the new recurring threads in mind, we've shuffled the schedule around a bit and introduced new days for some of our most popular threads. All threads will be autoposted by our new minions - /u/Lady_Syrupp will be posting links for you to follow and upvote so that our minions can automatically bypass the captcha. Our schedule is now as follows:

*Monday*: Recent Purchases / Simple Questions (**new!**)

*Tuesday*: Hair, Makeup, Skincare, Fragrance and Fitness / Theme Submission / General Discussion (**new!**)

*Wednesday*: WAYWT / Random Fashion Thoughts (**new!**)

*Thursday*: Simple Questions / Theme Announcement / Fit Check Thread (**new!**)

*Friday*: General Discussion

*Saturday*: Need/Want/Love (**new!**)

*Sunday*: WAYWT

**New Valued Advice Givers**

FFA first introduced the concept of a Valued Advice Giver, or VAG, last September, and we continue to recognize exceptional contributors with this title. This go-round, we'd like to acknowledge the efforts of three FFAers:

* /u/HOT_LOBSTER
* /u/dwindling
* /u/exprofesso

Hard work and dedication like theirs makes FFA the wonderful subreddit that it is!

As some of you might have noticed, the sidebar mod list has seen a bit of change over the past few days.

Believe it our not, moderators have lives outside of FFA (except for me - I'm a robot beep beep boop beep). The moderation team found that they simply didn't have enough time to keep up with the growing community AND feed their sea monkeys.

We've enlisted one of our finest (no really, we mean it this time) VAGs - /u/Schiaparelli - to join the moderation team. Schiaparelli is a wonderful, consistent member of the community. She contributes advice, submits bangin' original content, builds community, serves as an ambassador to - *gasp* - /r/malefashionadvice, and is generally cheerful enough to make more jaded (and drunk) mods suspicious.

Weddings are happy, joyous occasions that celebrate all that is good in life. Love, family, friends, fun, food and dancing. So exciting! So, you’re invited to a wedding. Now, the big question is: What do I wear? As a guest it is important to dress appropriately for the event. It is someone else’s ‘big day’ but you are invited to share it with them. There seems to be a lot of questions in /r/FFA about wedding attire. Here are some tips and ideas for dressing for a wedding.


**The OBVIOUS**: Do not wear anything white. Do not wear anything even close to white, including ivory, cream or extremely pale pastels. If you have to ask yourself if a cream dress is ""kind of close to white"" then don't wear it. Find something else.


**Hot tip #1**: Wear a dress. It’s festive and weddings are an occasion to get dressed up!


**Hot tip #2**: If you know what the bridesmaids are wearing then this is a good guide for the level of formality required for the event.  


**Hot tip #3**: Be mindful of the color theme of the wedding and try to *avoid* those shades. It’s a little awkward to be mistaken as part of the wedding party. The invitation sometimes has clues as to the color scheme.


**Hot tip #4**: If you don’t know the details about the wedding then err on the side of dressy. I find it’s better to be slightly overdressed than underdressed.


**Hot tip #5**: If the ceremony includes a religious service in a church then consider a more conservative dress and something (a cardigan, pashmina) to cover up exposed shoulders or a low neckline during the service. It doesn’t matter if you are religious or not, clothing worn in most churches should be conservative.


**Hot tip #6**: Weddings are family events so save the sexy, tight dresses for the Bachelorette party or a weekend night out. It’s the bride’s time to shine so avoid plunging necklines.


**Hot tip #7**: As for any outfit, it is critical to be confident and comfortable. A dress that is too large, too small or too far out of your own comfort zone could really ruin an otherwise good time. 


**Hot tip #8**: If you start early, you’ll have more time to get everything together. This opens up the option of ordering something online and time for tailoring. There are countless online retailers that carry nice dresses: modcloth.com, piperlime.com, bluefly.com, gilt.com and zappos.com. Many have free shipping and very good deals on high quality dresses.


**Hot tip #9**: The most important thing is to have fun and share in the celebration with the happy couple. 


**Spring/Summer Day Weddings**: These casual events take advantage of the nice weather but still require festive attire. There is probably something already in your closet that would be fine to wear. Depending on the venue anything from a cotton print sundress to a cocktail dress is completely appropriate. Cotton sundresses and espadrilles are great for destination weddings to a warm climate; think wedding on the beach. On the other end of the spectrum, a cocktail dress and strappy heels would be ideal for an afternoon wedding at a winery. Be careful not to pick a cocktail dress or shoes with too many embellishments, like rhinestones, glitter, metallic details because it can weird during the day time. Most colors with the exception of anything too light are okay but try to keep it bright for the season. Shoes should complement the style of the dress while keeping the venue in mind. Tiptoeing around in stiletto heels in grass is not fun.  

Here are a few ideas to serve as a starting point: [link](http://www.polyvore.com/spring_summer_daytime_weddings/set?id=76905570)


**Shopping tip**: Make sure to get a dress you know you can wear again for many other events. There are so many popular retailers that have a huge variety of these kinds of dresses: J.Crew, anthropologie, Zara are a few that pop into mind. Be weary of Forever 21 or H&amp;M as many of their dresses are too blingy or sexy or cheaply constructed.


**Semi-formal Evening Weddings**: Evening events are generally more formal and require a cocktail dress.  I tend to stay away from busy floral patterns and cotton for evening parties because they can look too casual. Parties are usually held indoors, but the evening can be cool so bring a pashmina to keep warm. Pick a color that is season appropriate, but remember that pastels can appear more casual than darker jewel tones. A little black dress is a safe bet if accessorized with a few nice pieces. I tend to reserve metallic/jacquard for fall/winter and bright chiffons for spring/summer. I think strappy heels or pumps are best with cocktail dresses, but keep in mind that pantyhose may be necessary for more conservative events. I always go with very sheer, nude or black hosiery. I tend to be sure that my hair is styled, rather than loose. An updo is not always necessary but it will help make the look more formal. Accessories will depend on the style of the dress. I generally accessorize more with plainer dresses and keep it very simple with ornate ones. 

Some inspiration: [link](http://www.polyvore.com/evening_wedding/set?id=76912520)


**Shopping tip**: Buy a timeless dress that you *really*genuinely like. There is more chance that you’ll wear it again instead of having to buy a new one for every event. Shop the sale racks and score a really great deal on a beautiful cocktail dress. A few stores to start looking are BCBG, any large department store like Nordstrom and Nicole Miller. 


**Black-tie Weddings**: Black tie weddings are so much fun. It is kind of like prom for grownups. This is an opportunity to really go all out. I tend toward floor length gowns in black and darker shades, regardless of the season. A very dressy cocktail dress is also fine.  Don’t hesitate to try out small embellishments, tasteful metallic and bits of bling. Like semi-formal events, I try to stick to season-appropriate materials; Reserve heavy velvets and taffeta for the colder months and lighter silks, chiffons for warmer. If you absolutely love a bright, patterned gown, then go for it during the spring/summer but make sure the material is quality and the accessories are kept to a minimum. My rule of thumb for tasteful gowns (and to avoid looking like you are on your way to a high school prom): Pick *two*: strapless, high slits, backless, printed, slinky or embellished. The key word here is classy, not sexy. Keep in mind that there is a good chance that you’ll run into someone’s grandmother on the way to the dance floor. Speaking of dance floor, be sure to have the dress tailored so it doesn’t drag or get stepped on. Dressy sandals or pumps are fine and hose is most likely necessary. Accessorize with tasteful jewelry that accents your gown. Be careful about wearing overly ‘blingy’ jewelry, as it can cheapen your overall look. 

A few dresses to consider: [link](http://www.polyvore.com/black_tie/set?id=76923643)


**Shopping tip**: This category is hard because the price points are pretty wide ranging. All of the same retailers I mentioned in the semi-formal category will have gowns as well. The trick is finding a nice gown without breaking the bank. Its completely doable by shopping the sale racks. It could easily be years before there is an occasion to wear it again so try to find something timeless and classic that will be wearable for years to come.


*Disclaimer*: This is by no means an exhaustive guide to wedding apparel. I just wrote this up because I noticed that there were at least two posts every day asking about what to wear to a wedding. The dresses are what *I* think are some good ideas, inspiration, jumping off points. Every event is different and there are tons of other things to consider. I don't have much experience with European or very rural weddings, but i'm sure there are additional considerations. Consistent with all other /r/FFA advice, its important to dress yourself for your body type. I’m open to suggestions or input! Thanks for reading. Cheers!

Lot's of text and I'm so sorry if I offend - I'm really trying!,eelassirak,215,49,102,http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1hbl4q/crossdressing_my_new_perspective_lots_of_text_and/,"I've seen crossdressers on here and /r/MakeupAddiction , and it made me question my opinions on it. I was raised evangelical Christian in Texas, so obviously my childhood was littered with the words ""abomination"" and ""unnatural"" for things like homosexuality and cross-dressing, transsexuals, etc. But in the past few years, I've realized that's stupid because people should be true to themselves. If a guy wants to wear a dress because it makes him feel good, awesome. It's not hurting anyone and it's bringing him joy. Woo!

So now here I am, trying to look at these posts with non-judgemental eyes, but the guys just look silly in these dresses. Because they're made to accentuate the ""ideal"" *female* body. Small waist, hourglass shoulder/hip ratio. The ""ideal"" male body is an inverted triangle - wide shoulders/chest, narrow waist straight down to narrow hips. 

So my thought was: Are there many dresses/skirts made to accentuate a man's body? The cross-dressing I've personally encountered has been men trying to look like a woman. But I know there are men who love being men and just want to wear a dress. [Indian men](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oq1cCvuP3hQ/UJknqBGjAyI/AAAAAAAAASc/ERxN2-6mstM/s1600/Indian+Wedding+Dress+For+Men.jpg) wear such gorgeous and masculine dresses (that are very wide and stocky through the shoulder, and structured through the hip to show off how ""strong"" they are)... I wonder if there's a retailer that sells non-indian-looking mens dresses. [This](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7SUBTbufYf0/Tz_FUvzGBlI/AAAAAAAAA8Y/blfoskxJjDI/s1600/shirt+dress1.jpg) type of dress does exactly what I'm trying to convey... masculinity using structure and lines (although I would move the belt down to the hips since it's the smallest part). And [this](http://cdn.stylefrizz.com/img/man-in-dress.jpg) guy looks really really good in a dress, but it's plain black. Patterns on dresses are almost always very feminine looking (flowers, polka dots).

I don't really know what I'm trying to say with this... maybe just that I support men who want to wear dresses, but someone needs to get going on a creation and marketing of masculine dresses. Maybe that's an ignorant statement because that's assuming there's defined aspects of masculinity and femininity...

Hello, /r/femalefashionadvice!
I know that I'll be breaking a few rules with this post due to mirror pics but there are so many clothes I didn't want to make someone else sit there and take every picture. Mods, just let me know and I'll take this post down if necessary.
Anyway, my Grandma recently passed away and I was fortunate enough to receive all of her clothes. Now, of course, like any granny, she had some not so cute outfits and things that wouldn't fit. But I went through everything and this is what I found.

http://imgur.com/a/nO1qP#0

So here I am, wondering if any of these clothes would be worth keeping or if I should just give them to salvo. I don't know if this is the best subreddit to submit this to, I just don't know another place to go with so many subscribers that could potentially help me.

Also, I must apologize for the wrinkles in the clothes. When I moved them from her house, I had to put them in boxes and whatnot so they have yet to be washed by me. (Not that they're dirty.) Plus they still smell like my Grandma which is comforting.

I'll post reminders more heavily for the next week, and then cool down to Friday update/reminder posts in the FFA and MFA General Discussion threads.

Hey, FFA. We've had discussions in the past about [personal uniforms](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/14yczz/our_uniforms/) and [challenges](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1btbmp/two_minimalist_wardrobe_challenges_project_333/) that to help you analyze your wardrobe, but thus far we've seen no community examples. I propose a challenge to change that. For the next month, participants should take a picture of their outfit every day, and compile them into an album for a discussion at the end of the month. My hope is that we'll be able to talk about how uniform or not our styles really are and have a peek into the outfits of FFA'ers outside of WAYWT days. It's a really simple challenge, and I don't want to impose any constraints - just dress like you normally would, but take a picture on your way out the door! 

---

If you're interested in participating, please leave a post so we can get a rough headcount going! Don't be afraid to talk about your predictions for your own outfits, what you hope to see at the end of the month, or anything else related to the challenge. Also please feel free to post any inspiration, such as blog posts about 30 day challenges (or similar) and other examples of completed daily outfit challenges. 

We've gotten some great suggestions and questions so far, so a few things to consider as you approach this challenge:

* you could use this to help pare down your wardrobe!
* this could serve as motivation to get dressed or care about your presentation on off days!
* consider writing a sentence or two about the occasions for each outfit!
* PJs are totally great, submit pics of your lazy days too!

I strongly suggest including at least 14 outfits in your final albums, so we can get a good sense of your daily style.

---

I have a few logistical concerns that I'd like to get all of your opinions on in this thread. 

* How often would you like to see reminders? I would post something in recurring threads like GD not a standalone thread. 

* What are your feelings about latecomers to the challenge? I want to be as inclusive as possible, but I also think that posting one outfit at the end ignores the spirit of the challenge. How many outfits would you want to see? Any feelings about crossposting to WAYWT? (i.e. what if someone submits an album containing pictures that have all been in the past month's WAYWT?)

* Any other concerns/ideas, bearing in mind that the goal is to get a snapshot of what FFA'ers normally wear.

My selections reflected much of what I learned here (I didn't get the exact things people recommended but it was conceptually similar) as well as what my girlfriend felt were good compromises between fashion and art.

Magazines, a couple comic books (Xmen and Teen Titans), drawing books, a couple art kits, a henna tattoo kit (whoa...controversial) and a little Molskine note book for small drawings.

Also...$ for a shopping ""spree."" More like a baby spree but still she'll have fun.

As you have all probably noticed, this subreddit is absolutely **flooded** with 

* ""Find me this _______ for cheaper"" 

* ""Help me find _______, it is sold out in my size""

* ""Where can I get something similar to _______?""

To be quite blunt, it is pretty exhausting for the community to be constantly utilized as someone's personal Google search team, and it is a bad use of space on the front page (which could otherwise be used for discussions or fun things like blart_history's [How Would You Wear It](http://redd.it/qnp2g) posts).

I think it would be pretty appropriate at this juncture to provide a quick guide on **How to Search for Things on the Internet.**

****

**Google**

Seriously, Google is your friend. Google is a very powerful search engine and should satisfy most needs. Examples of how to Google:

* Google **keywords.** For example, if I wanted to find a dress similar to [this one](http://i.imgur.com/tVcvr.jpg), I would try searching any combination of keywords, such as
    - black
    - dress
    - spaghetti strap
    - rosette
    - sheer
    
    Search terms can include shape, color, cut, print, length, fabric type, brand (if known), and any other defining characteristics.

* Google **images.** Similar to the site [TinEye](http://www.tineye.com/), Google now has reverse-image search functionality. Simply go to the [Google Images search page](http://images.google.com/) and either 
    - Click on the camera in the search bar to input a URL, or
    - Drag an image from your computer directly into the search box

    If we image search the dress from above, it pulls up [these results](https://www.google.com/search?tbs=sbi:AMhZZiuJNrwB35QaoUC1S_1Qn6_1kPqI2WVTz98GpDjfh3Llji_1b6d1jgwaBD2hJOL3hIjXvtHhLyE-iMS915F2E9I_1K3xroibfqo3zJ0PB5CQx4To4Omrzh-tReR_1xjsMRwAnvlO4DEwG3Ib6-DbN71DPA3rD9v5Ls-JUINkJ984OSznPtFtHHGfVe_1xfoaHqdcw8-f8QWvbfaPN0d9axqJD3YOgqLjvVP_1q6Vo3uU2kxdyUfdKLzzO-xwDyEiadqJkiKhURPx54XTbfS7_14r728x-k40TbJj6IejJvTexGsXYiay36xtcDw2rKfO0mHo0iO3RaScHtlk35w0P1N2hCdI3bOrjQVIRpS0j4x0jqYKZIHP4jbUKkU8-hvJnQgJdb2DCg6lRx7T7aQ51k_1QFNiJTqcNEK16uDfUlfVx9uWWUmT3cOLIyuV69XP4yFi2VPEYE8bCdyluAQLqw91DRiLnSrsoP6keR5UiTne0baUKbjoz3PwJ8rFhLIBb2n1mp6Ri3qZFwlO2_1ZzOlP-dv01wH1GYqDgpL7mIzy61Xx6sFsfwVdEBLitUjHOf50Q49E3V7SCTpIOVrb3OF699E6ZkKrvPIVJMrKgoI-UGfCAA9tHT7w7KqZaX3rwc0L5w7zQaTnHa8w10iiWy8hzipXvs63DZXVdSsQl5RmvAldReNDDpO_1kmT_1_1Ek2eva6jtKed4_1AzkD-sivcMQxg0r0skxXIYlbrK4W8X29QVWLq4J1UVYkFX1-eQzyyfA47gYAx_16ID4f3rZ16N1sPJtqQ-EfdH_1w8Lo5W21-j9lcKDoTvzK51g0pF-XE3X-_1esQUZdKqnFZmnQ4IoHoO_1_1XD1dLACtAWhaHwxMJBZpEyM0lcsxEYblOnWLZeU2FoNRhLuoIDvNvVdkJuYVtZuBLNRU_1HF16Gk0r6YiKeqDccZVG0W_1h1WgdIl10iMMLPBfQ1c_1CcFDMAdCkeyvN66B35lOLO8tStCh9ewz7hiQRZuCboI8AtRAwVyDoGLPGQudBgw1tg1_11Ukw2vvJtzXl0dbajVgYn1MwspKLIYVZXEb1MWHyAF_1bl9rSfcj_19jU-KX2mV-GLKL0yLmtXTJjUy93qZjgeqLwqq0uQQzfbq-QU0Tl8RzKpfWsdFkd0FnaexOrEmEfdOV5EtWk9Y9fNb33xYWIax3JJPOXUnBD5kvuHXWjisvDMF0wzokZifM_1wZGo_1DSkt-LG0VbFHUXt-tjL2oFSgkwu1GnPylpgGmc45OHUa_1skoHwW4YHwKQu3sNSBzI62G0PV5_1GR79jMk2T8Ih9C7lYgC_1dnCqRCXMLBUxLi_1aBYLKD8cO2HvkH8R5h-XkbPol_1lxGqyvbmSGNZ9yyrxFYHUZsNHg&amp;num=10&amp;hl=en&amp;bih=548&amp;biw=1109). As you can see, it immediately suggested the phrase ""marc jacobs rosette dress,"" the Net-a-Porter page on which it can be purchased, and a butt load of similar images and sites who mention it.

    You can also search using both an image *and* words by using the method above and then inputting words into the search bar.

Similarly, you can use [Google Shopping](http://www.google.com/shopping) to quickly search for sites that sell products matching your search terms; however, Google Shopping is not a very inclusive site and your results will not be varied. Which brings us to...

**Shopstyle**

I also want to include a quick note about another useful website, [Shopstyle](http://www.shopstyle.com/). Shopstyle culls search results from hundreds of different websites into one place and makes it easy to view all of the retail listings for items that meet your search parameters. 

Search for any phrase (e.g. ""black dress,"" ""brown knee high boots,"" ""green military jacket"") and it will pull up an unfathomable amount of results, which then can be filtered by Category, Brand, Store, Sale, Price, Color, and Size. You can also save searches and come back to them later.

**Polyvore**

[Polyvore](http://www.polyvore.com/?p=1) is similar in concept, and you can also use it to create [composite outfit sets/moodboards](http://i.imgur.com/oUWlj.jpg).

**eBay**

We all know what [eBay is](http://www.ebay.com/). Just wanted to remind everyone that it can be helpful in finding garments that are sold out in your size or are out of production.

****

In conclusion, **please** do your due diligence before creating topics willy-nilly asking for help finding something. If you have truly put in an effort and cannot seem to find any satisfactory results, *then* you are welcome to make a post about it.

Another concern I have is storage - for instance, I've stopped hanging my knits after reading a comment here. One minute hanging knits seemed harmless but as soon as it was pointed out to someone else that you shouldn't, it made a hell of a lot of sense. It had just never occurred to me, which makes me wonder what else I could potentially be doing that would damage my clothes.

So, can I get some free-for-all advice related to cleaning clothes and storing clothes? I generally wash everything on delicate and airdry certain items (bras, jeans, and knits) but I'm sure there's more I can be doing. Hopefully this is helpful for others as well!

**FAQ**

*What if I wore PJs all day?* Post them. That was your outfit.

*What if I wear a uniform that might identify me?* You can blur/block nametags, and if the uniform is too identifiable, feel free to leave it out. I'm not here to invade your privacy. (Bonus PJ pics from those days are always welcome!)

*What if my outfits are boring?* Post them. This isn't about having the best collection of outfits, this is about looking at how we dress every day. It's to help us learn to look at trends and patterns rather than details!

*Should I post the brands/set a personal goal/otherwise go above and beyond daily selfies?* Anything more than compiling an album of outfits is totally voluntary.",[Announcement],False,self,t5_2s8o5,False,announce,vag vag3,True,t3_1imz2v,http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1imz2v/ffamfa_monthlong_challenge_submission_thread/,

Not sure if this belongs here, but here goes... I've been hoarding links to online clothing stores for a while (I am addicted to online shopping) and I used to run a review site but unfortunately there came a point where I could no longer afford to review every single site ): I was wondering if anyone's bought from any of these stores (I gave short descriptions for the ones I know), I starred the ones that I haven't bought from and would love to get reviews for. 

I'll be updating this as I go, if you guys have any more clothing stores that'd be great! I have more but these are just the ones saved in one of my folders on this computer. Hope this helps! (:

[($) Forever 21](http://www.forever21.com/Product/Main.aspx?br=f21) has one of the better quality to price ratios of the fast fashion retailers. You get what you pay for, generally. Styles are geared to a generally younger audience. I would avoid purchasing professional clothing, since it is cheap and it shows. I would personally only purchase ""trendy"" items that I know I would only want for a season or two. Can be very hit or miss in terms of quality. I would highly suggest going in store rather than ordering online because of this, and sometimes odd sizing.

*[($) Love Culture](http://www.loveculture.com/) I believe this is similar to F21

*[($) Bon Prix](http://www.bonprix.co.uk/) UK based store. Reviews?

*[($) Matalan](http://www.matalan.co.uk/) Another UK based store. Reviews?

*[($) Papaya Clothing](http://www.papayaclothing.com/shop/) cheap clothes, good place to get some fun clubbing dresses or tanks and shorts. However, you do get what you pay for- it's all cheaply made. Clothes run small.

[($) Charlotte Russe](http://www.charlotterusse.com/) : Basically the same as F21, except with a lot of bodycon dresses for 20-dollars-ish. I find that the clothing quality isn't that great, I own a few skirts + dresses and the color fades really quickly, even before being washed.

[($) WetSeal](http://wetseal.com/home.jsp) Same terrible-ish quality as Charlotte Russe. Great for cheap basics.

*[($) DebShops](http://www.debshops.com/) Any reviews? I've got nothing.

*[($) Supre](http://www.supre.com.au/Home.aspx?element=1&amp;category=1) AU-based, simple, cheap stuff.

*[($) Stradivarius](http://www.stradivarius.com/) Never shopped here, they don't ship to the US, but if you live in one of the listed countries they have great stuff.

[($$) American Eagle](http://www.ae.com/web/index.jsp) Decent quality, a little more expensive and one of those ""mainstream brands"" but I buy a lot of flannels for ten bucks.

[($$) Aerie](http://www.ae.com/aerie/) Offshoot of American Eagle

[($$) Aeropostale](http://www.aeropostale.com/shop/index.jsp?categoryId=3534619) Very little kid-ish

[($$) Abercrombie](http://www.abercrombie.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/StoreView?storeId=10051&amp;langId=-1&amp;catalogId=10901) A little overpriced in my opinion but every now and then they'll come out with something really cute without a giant moose on it.

[($$) Hollister](http://www.hollisterco.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/StoreView?storeId=10251&amp;langId=-1&amp;catalogId=10201) See above. Replace moose with bird-thing.

[($$) Pacsun](http://www.pacsun.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-pacsun-Site/default/Default-Start) Very beachy. Some cute stuff if you look hard. If you go in-store they have decent jeans for 5-10 dollars

*[($$) CCS](http://shop.ccs.com/) Very streetwear. Kind of like Pacsun.

*[($$) Phix Clothing](http://www.phixclothing.com/) Retro stuff yay. Actually, has a lot of streetwear-brand clothing like Cheap Monday and Motel.

*[($$) Love Clothing](http://www.loveclothing.com/) Basically Phix Clothing under a different name.

*[($$) Shop Akira](http://www.shopakira.com/) Similar to Phix Clothing/Shop Akira

*[($$) GoJane](http://www.gojane.com/) I think this is oriented towards teens but lately they've been getting some pretty cool stock. Any reviews?

[($$) H&amp;M](http://www.hm.com/us/) Never bought anything online but the stuff in-store is mediocre quality

*[($$) Felicee](http://www.felicee.com/store/) Looks super-cheap to me.

*[($$) Fred Flare](http://www.fredflare.com/customer/home_fredflare.php?) Like a cheaper version of Free People. Cute gifts, if Urban Outfitters and Free People had a lovechild it would be this.

*[($$) River Island](http://www.riverisland.com/) Some pretty cheap stuff, I debated downgrading this to $ but most stuff is in the 20-dollar range. I've heard that the stuff is pretty good quality for the price but again, confirmation would be fantastic.

[($$) ASOS](http://us.asos.com/Shop-womens-clothes-dresses-shoes-coats-bags-more-at-ASOS/wh5yb/?r=1&amp;mk=VOID) I buy most of my stuff here- the sale section is like a candy store. Shipping is really good and they also have concession brands

*[($$) Urban Outfitters](http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/index.jsp) mostly overpriced, though their sales are often worth it. Lots of ""mainstream hipster"" items, generally on-trend, often a bit gaudy or over-the-top. Quality is so-so, perhaps a bit lower than the Gap. love this site. Good shipping rates and they have good streetwear brands. I love the shoes and outwear mainly. I got a Stussy jacket for $19 and another wool/leather sleeves jacket from 154$ down to $19. Both are exceptional quality. I also got some Jeffrey Campbell Tardy's for $50 a long time ago. They have really good sales if you keep checking back you will find some unbelievable steals.

[($$) Karmaloop](http://www.karmaloop.com/) Probably one of my favorite stores of all time! Streetwear clothing, carries brands like MINKPINK/UNIF/Supra but also some stranger stuff. Has some great sales (They have like 30% off once a month)

[($$) Motel](http://motelrocks.com/shop/) Printed dresses. I'm not sure about the quality but the prints are gorgeous. Affordable alternatives if you can't afford Black Milk.

[($$) Tobi](http://www.tobi.com/) Probably another one of my favorite stores. You might find them cheaper elsewhere but use the 50% off first-timers discount to your advantage.

[($$) Romwe](http://www.romwe.com/) Hongkong-based store, free int. shipping. Honestly they have some great pieces but I believe it's overpriced. Their leggings are also great knockoff versions of Black Milk. ridiculously overpriced from mass produced factories in China. If you go to Asia every single store will have the exact same clothes -you will realise how much they are overpricing the items to make a profit from unsuspecting people. It became very popular due to them sponsoring masses and masses of online personalities to promote their site.

[($$) Sheinside](http://www.sheinside.com/) Similar to Romwe

[($$) Solilor](http://www.solilor.com/) Also similar to Romwe

[($$) Tunnel Vision](http://shoptunnelvision.com/) One of my favorite online vintage stores. Sale section is spectacular.

*[($$) Miss London](http://www.missguided.co.uk/dresses) ASOS in disguise, maybe?

*[($$) Agaci](http://www.agacistore.com/) Mostly bodycon dresses but I really haven't checked it out that much

*[($$) Allyfashion](http://www.allyfashion.com/store/) is really good for the price. Most things are $20-$50 and are quite good quality for the price. I've had this dress from there for about four years, wear it all the time, and it still looks fantastic. A lot of their stuff is fast fashion and trendy items but their jeans are pretty good quality and really comfortable and they have some good basics and some of their professional stuff is okay. a bit like F21 for Australians. Super cheap. Pretty trendy and the stuff is decent quality for the price. I'd be cautious of the cut though, some of the stuff fits really weird on me personally. Supre- Infamous for dressing the less-than-classy-girls of Australia. I haven't walked into their store for 5 years and I'm not keen to do so any time soon. Everything is very thin, flimsy, cheap quality at normal prices.

*[($$) 2020Ave](http://shop.2020ave.com/clothing-dresses) Any reviews?

[($$) The Scarlet Room](http://www.thescarletroom.com/) The quality of pants/leather/denim is pretty terrible but I've bought some AMAZING pieces from this Hongkong-based store.

*[($$) Messes of Dresses](http://www.messesofdresses.com/) My preferred alternative to Modcloth. A little more expensive but some of the stock has that wow-factor that will get you compliments.

*[($$) Ruche](http://shopruche.com/index.php) See Messes of Dresses.

*[($$) Poetrie](http://www.poetrie.com/) See Ruche.

*[($$) Threadsence](http://www.threadsence.com/index.php) See Ruche. I've actually found that stores like GoJane sell the exact same clothing as Threadsence/Poetrie/Ruche, so that's something to consider if you want to price-check.

*[($$) Swell](http://www.swell.com/!Zc6KWo-tk4GWMD-g9-P6vg!/Womens) Very beach-y feel to it. A little more expensive than Pacsun but somewhat similar.

*[($$) NastyGal](http://www.nastygal.com/) Really large clothing company, some pretty funky clothing for decent prices. I would advise you to go to the sale section first if you don't want to end up with 300 dollars in your basket. nice stuff, has a lot of brands such as Unif, Jeffrey Campbell etc. Kinda pricey but they also have good sales. I don't really buy off here but I have a few times. I don't like their shipping rates, and they also ship extremely slowly as compared to UO.

*[($$) Gypsy Warrior](http://gypsywarrior.com/) Similar to Nastygal

*[($$) Living Royal](http://www.livingroyal.com/) Also similar to Nastygal

*[($$) Asociete](http://asociete.com/index.php) Any reviews? I've seen a lot of fashion blogs review em, but I'd love to confirm. Rather small collection of clothes to choose from

*[($$) Lazystyle](http://www.laztyle.com/) Cute tights/leggings

*[($$) Untitled Label](http://untitledlabel.com/sale) Simple stuff for cheap-ish

*[($$) Siren London](http://www.sirenlondon.com/) Cute dresses, not sure about the rest of the clothing. Any reviews on this place?

*[($$) ShopSosie](http://www.shopsosie.com/) Not worth the cost in my opinion but maybe someone says otherwise.

*[($$) Modcloth](http://www.modcloth.com/) Overpriced dresses. If you look hard enough you can find it somewhere else for 10 dollars cheaper.

*[($$) Awwdore](http://www.awwdore.com/) Similar to Modcloth

*[($$) Evo](http://www.evo.com/shop/womens-shop.aspx) Pacsun-esque

*[($$) Glamorous](http://glamorous.com/) UK-based. Any reviews?

*[($$) Dorothy Perkins](http://us.dorothyperkins.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/TopCategoriesDisplay?storeId=13065&amp;catalogId=34072&amp;geoip=home#slide2) A lot of people say that the sizing can be off but I have heard good things about this place.

*[($$) Goodnight Macaroon](http://www.shopgoodnightmacaroon.com/) Some cute stuff, prices range from 10 dollars to 300. I've seen a lot of reviews on fashion blogs, can anyone confirm?

*[($$) USTrendy](http://www.ustrendy.com/) It's a marketplace, has some gorgeous handmade, custom-tailored clothing. Price varies.

*[($$) Brooklyn Industries](http://www.brooklynindustries.com/index.cfm) Modern and chic.

*[($$) Lace Affair](http://www.laceaffair.com/) Super awesome dresses that I'd love to buy but cannot afford.

*[($$) Chloe Loves Charlie](http://www.chloelovescharlie.com/Welcome.do;jsessionid=7C4D959E9E48C51A91B4813DE1AC60CE.prod2) Similar to Lace Affair. Very retro/vintage.

*[($$) Lulu's](http://www.lulus.com/) Probably one of the best dress stores. Prices range from 20-50 dollars but they have a huge selection

*[($$) Joe Brown's](http://www.joebrowns.co.uk/) Reviews?

*[($$) Sugarlips](http://www.sugarlips.com/shop/) I really have no idea how to navigate this site, halp.'

[($$) J Crew Factory](http://factory.jcrew.com/index.jsp) slightly lower quality but significantly cheaper than J. Crew. Styles are about the same as J. Crew. Sweaters (particularly the cotton ones) appear cheaper quality, not sure if worth a purchase. Like J. Crew, has sales frequently, as well as 15% student discount.

*[($$) Necessary Clothing](http://www.necessaryclothing.com/) I've been to the New York store, the clothes are kind of generic fashion-brand but the prices are decent....ish.

[($$) Old Navy](http://oldnavy.gap.com/?) you get what you pay for. More ""traditional/sensible"" clothing for family. However, material is noticeably cheaper and fit (especially shirts/tops) are mediocre at best.

[($$) Gap](http://www.gap.com/) significantly better than Old Navy, more traditional as well, however they have been updating their brand lately (particular the 1969 jeans). Pants are of good quality and rather flattering. Good for more classic items.

*[($$) Brandy Melville](http://www.brandymelvilleusa.com/) Cute rings.

*[($$$) Madewell](http://www.madewell.com/) Kind of like a really expensive Aerie in my opinion. I've heard that their jeans are amazing.

*[($$$) Everlane](https://www.everlane.com/) Classics. Any reviews?

*[($$$) Zara](http://www.zara.com/) slightly higher quality than H&amp;M but still not worth the price. Clothes are trendy, but not made or designed to last a long time. Craftsmanship and material have gotten worse over the years (e.g. sweater stretched almost a whole size, pants lasted only a year). Would only purchase on sale.
expensive, high-quality, fashionable clothes. A dress will run you $70 but the styles are very good and will last a long time. quality can be hit and miss. I have stuff from 10 years ago that I still wear, and I have things that needed zippers fixing, or darning. Generally good quality though, and if you don't go for the trendier stuff, lasts a while in terms of keeping up with fashion.

*[($$$) Mango](http://shop.mango.com/preHome.faces;jsessionid=563D422B2D86DB884EDBB7BA1141A441) Like a slightly-cheaper-but-not-really Zara.

*[($$$) Moose Limited](http://www.mltd.com/) Very hypebeast-y clothing. Carries brands like Stussy and Obey.

*[($$$) Monsoon](http://us.monsoon.co.uk/?redirected;jsessionid=09789672FF06917DA9F0922D77B22AC8.app1) Reviews?

*[($$$) Debenham's](http://www.debenhams.com/) Reviews?

*[($$$) Zolando's](http://www.zalando.co.uk/) Reviews?

*[($$$) House of Fraser](http://www.houseoffraser.co.uk/) Reviews?

*[($$$) Rare London](http://www.rarelondon.com/) More expensive but they have gorgeous dresses. Does anyone know about the quality?

*[($$$) Choies](http://www.choies.com/) Some really interesting stuff.

*[($$$) Penny Stock Clothing](http://www.pennystockclothing.com/) Reviews?

*[($$$) ILWF](http://www.inlovewithfashion.com/) Some gems if you look hard enough. The prices make me cringe but it's all in the name of fashion

*[($$$) Dalaga](http://www.dalaganyc.com/) Some good stuff, some plain, completely-overpriced stuff too.

*[($$$) Misselfridge](http://us.missselfridge.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/TopCategoriesDisplay?storeId=13069&amp;catalogId=34080&amp;geoip=home) I actually am in love with the clothes but I'm too broke to buy any.

*[($$$) Edge of Urge](https://edgeofurge.com/) I've been meaning to buy from this place for a while. Really Indie-looking stuff.

*[($$$) Storets](http://storets.com/) Looks like a Korean or Chinese-based clothing company. They have some pretty unique stuff, anyone ever bought from here?

*[($$$) Topshop](http://us.topshop.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/TopCategoriesDisplay?storeId=12556&amp;catalogId=33057&amp;geoip=home#slide1) Kind of like a more expensive version of ASOS. On par in terms of style.

[($$$) J Crew](http://www.jcrew.com/index.jsp) great quality, great customer service. Have a good range of classic and conservative pieces, as well as classic pieces that are on trend and modern. Pricey but worth it for staple pieces. Have not heard great things about their shoes, however. I suggest waiting for sales since they are frequent and plentiful. Have 15% student discount.

*[($$$) Shoppalu](http://shoppalu.com/) Not sure where it's based but they have really great vintage clothes

*[($$$) Stylenanda](http://www.stylenandaen.com/) very cute, unique stuff. I recently ordered off there. The shipping rates are decent and the order came relatively quickly. (About 2 weeks to Aus). It is abit pricey but you are I guess paying for unique items. Some of the materials looks totally different in person but the quality (stitching, cut) is all good so I'm not too disappointed. Everything is free size so my fat ass has really limited choices. But their clothes are really that effortless/baggy look so they accommodate most.

*[($$$) Princess Polly](http://www.princesspolly.com.au/) Australia-based, looks kind of not-worth-it to me.

*[($$$$) Need Supply](http://needsupply.com/) Some really simple clothing for very large prices, any reviews?

*[($$$$) Desigual](http://www.desigual.com/en_US) Super-awesome, unique prints on clothing. A little overpriced but definitely ""one of a kind""

*[($$$$) Free People](http://www.freepeople.com/) Some really great stuff but it's so expensive that it hurts to look at. You can buy plenty of free people for a lot less at places like Karmaloop.

*[($$$$) Bird Motel](http://www.birdmotel.com.au/) Super-cute stuff, charges ridiculous amounts of money to ship to the US

[Black Milk Clothing](http://blackmilkclothing.com/) WORDS CANNOT DESCRIBE HOW IN-LOVE I AM WITH ALL OF THESE. Careful of the import fees.

--------
FLASH SALE STORES: these are all online flash-sales. Basically, things go on sale for two or three days and you have the option to pick stuff up at discounted prices. It's a first come, first serve kind of deal and I've gotten everything from jeans to prom dresses to fluffy blankets from these websites. I have referral links if you're interested (:

[Ideeli](http://www.ideeli.com/) Nothing really name-brand but a lot of decently priced stuff.

[Hautelook](http://www.hautelook.com/events#all) Some great name-brand things, everything from MINKPINK to Sam Edelman. 

[Ruelala](http://www.ruelala.com/event) Basically like a more chic Hautelook, also lots of namebrand clothes for significant discounts (I found these discounts are actually better than the other websites)

[GILT](http://www.gilt.com/) Sells more than clothes.

Sells those really well-known brands at discounts.

[PLNDR](http://plndr.com/) Offshoot of Karmaloop, basically karmaloop with a rotating cycle of similar clothing.

The dress: http://i.imgur.com/AhWNOBm.jpg

Me in the dress: http://i.imgur.com/XV8i9eN.jpg

I'm currently somewhat stuck about accessories, however. I've bought this vintage shell bag, which I love because it seems to fit and it reminds me of the ocean: http://i.imgur.com/GvyrRFW.jpg

I can use it with and without the strap since it packs away, which is nice.

I've tried a few pairs of shoes but I'm feeling a little discouraged. I bought [these](http://www.elegantpark.com/product/Lovely-Round-Toes-Kitten-Heel-Lace-And-Satin-Wedding-Bridal-Shoes_p5176.html) thinking they might work and that was a horrible, horrible mistake. So I'm back looking for some kind of ivory/champagne strappy or peeptoe shoe with a low-ish heel. 

I'm thinking of getting a feather wrap or shrug like [this](http://www.etsy.com/listing/97190004/hollywood-vintage-glamour-marabou) just in case it is a cold day. I considered fur but honestly it just squicks me and all the fake fur shrugs I've seen look tacky as hell. 

I have absolutely no idea what to do with my makeup and hair. Maybe pin curls or finger curls? Birdcage or short [juliet cap veil](http://www.etsy.com/listing/115813803/crystal-rhinestone-cap-veil-juliet-cap)? Or perhaps just an updo with a flower? I know FFA isn't really the place to ask for hair and makeup stuff, but if anyone has good advice in the context of the rest of my outfit I am all ears. :P

Anyway, about me:

Measurements are 34 bust, 27 waist, 38 hips, so that makes me a pear. I am tall (5'10/5'11 or so) with a 34"" inseam. Shoe size 8.5. Boring brown hair. Coloring: damned if I know. Pale?

Budget is about $500 all up. So I don't mind spending $100 or so each on a shrug/veil/shoes/etc. In case anyone is curious, the above dress was $98. I may yet get it slightly altered to fit better.

Timeline: I would need to receive everything in the next six weeks.

Any help or advice would be seriously appreciated!!",,False,self,t5_2s8o5,False,,,True,t3_1cp79u,http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1cp79u/ladies_please_help_me_accessorize_my_1920sdeco/,

Help?",killertofuuuuu,170,24,139,http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1jm37w/what_is_the_female_equivalent_of_a_mens_suit_when/,"Normally at work, I wear a pencil skirt, normal trousers, or ankle length trousers with simple black leather kitten heels or a plain ballet flat.   Also, a button up blouse in a plain colour, or a cardigan with a plain shell under it.  My office is pretty plain so I think I would get taken less seriously if I dressed more fashionable or in more colours, even though I would love to.   


We were instructed to dress extra fancy last friday because were were meeting and presenting to important clients.   I wore a black suit (blazer and matching pencil skirt) and a cobalt blue shell under it and black pointed toe pumps.  I wore my hair up to look more professional.  All the men were wearing fancy suits and ties!

I felt more put together in my outfit but I dont think I felt or looked as powerful and professional as the men, even in my own suit.  :(

I feel more put together in high heels but also vulnerable.  Flats are more comfy but I have never seen a pair if women's super professional looking flats like men wear - they different iterations of girly looking ballet flats.


There is nothing wrong with being girly or being a woman.  But I feel like they should make clothes for woman that make them look powerful and competent.  


Men look effortlessly fabulous in suits - what is the female equivalent?

1367799636.0,146,self.femalefashionadvice,1drf2t,Closet Organization and Space Saving Tips,purplenat,164,18,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1drf2t/closet_organization_and_space_saving_tips/,"I have A LOT of clothes, and in the dozen or so homes I’ve lived in, many have had very little closet space. Here is 12+ years worth of tips on how to cram your stuff into the minimal space you have. The personal images I link to below are from [this album]( http://imgur.com/a/c6IO1) of my current closet situation. 
  
**General tips:**  

1. Use ALL available space, but keep it organized
2. Keep out-of-season (winter/summer) clothes out of the way
3. You’re more likely to wear something if you can see it
4. Keep 1-2 hooks empty for quick-n-dirty clean up
5. Don’t forget the backs of deep shelves, and high up places
  
**Hanging Clothes:**  

- Install a second closet rod above your main one. This basically doubles your space. Buy a [stool]( http://www.amazon.com/Hardwood-Footstool-in-Espresso-Finish-12/dp/B00487NJCC/ref=pd_bxgy_hg_img_y) (my preference) or a [reaching rod]( http://www.amazon.com/Hanger-Hooker-Wooden-Handle--Reach/dp/B0027Z02ZY/ref=sr_1_2?s=home-garden&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1367782266&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=reaching+rod) for access. (Note: I have often done this myself on the cheap – check the interwebs for [tutorials]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LimIOo_cuTA) or visit your local home improvement store.)
- Matching hangers makes everything [look so nice]( http://i.imgur.com/FR1afdx.jpg). I have [these Joy Mangano ones]( http://www.hsn.com/shop/huggable-hangers/jm0001) and I LOVE THEM SO MUCH. I bought a 200-pack or something like that when it was on special. Worth it. 
- [Cascading hooks]( http://www.hsn.com/products/joy-mangano-huggable-hangers-set-of-20-cascading-hooks/6580911) are [bloody genius]( http://i.imgur.com/6fA9Yp3.jpg) and work with almost any hanger. Use [two at a time]( http://i.imgur.com/NvKEJYi.jpg)!
- You can get a [tiered hanger]( http://www.amazon.com/Whitmor-6021-185-Chrome-Collection-Folding/dp/B000L1KN14/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top) for skirts. [Mine]( http://i.imgur.com/YZhQVcu.jpg) is over 30 years old and still going strong.
- I have yet to find the perfect single skirt hanger commercially available, but it must have [spring-clips]( http://i.imgur.com/NpsiTm5.jpg) and [smooth rubber]( http://i.imgur.com/44Do4CF.jpg) grips. The Joy Mangano clips suck balls – don’t waste your money. 
  
**Folded Clothes:**  

- Fold all [knit items]( http://www.onelittleminuteblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/knit-fabric-overview-one-little-minute-blog-knits-vs-wovens.jpg) to prevent [hanger bumps]( http://www.refinery29.com/static/bin/entry/ea8/x/67793/hanger.jpg). That includes sweaters, most T-shirts, and some blouses. 
- Got deep shelves? Fold clothes [appropriately]( http://coderedhat.com/how-fold-towels/). If you still have space behind your folded clothes (i.e. really deep shelves) store your out-of-season sandals/sweaters back there. (Tip 2 &amp; 5 combo!)
- If you are using a dresser or other drawers, stack clothes [vertically]( http://i.imgur.com/zyYzYly.jpg) rather than horizontally. (See tip 3.) I do this for EVERYTHING including [tights]( http://i.imgur.com/nxktS38.jpg), [socks]( http://i.imgur.com/TpG7Lz2.jpg), PJs, and even underwear! BTW, [folding]( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KADP9oTF2ro/TpeNScLtMDI/AAAAAAAABBY/DKz4z6UywS4/s1600/fold+panties+collage.jpg) your [underwear](http://www.carlaanne.com/2012/09/folding-football-underwear/)saves space but people may call you OCD – weigh your options wisely. 
- For open shelving, be sure not to [stack]( http://i.imgur.com/0bDNSz9.jpg) so high that it tumbles.
- Feel free to use [extra shelving]( http://www.amazon.com/Grayline-40710-Jumbo-Kitchen-Helper/dp/B000LNVXIY/ref=pd_sim_hg_5) in already existing [shelves]( http://i.imgur.com/zKigKtl.jpg). 
  
**Shoes &amp; Boots:**  

- Use an [over-the-door]( http://www.amazon.com/Whitmor-6486-1746-WHT-Over-The-Door-White-36-Pair/dp/B0019FOUQ0/ref=sr_1_2?s=home-garden&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1367780439&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=over+the+door+shoe+organizer) shoe organizer - I like these better than [hang-in-the-closet]( http://www.amazon.com/Household-Essentials-20-Pocket-Hanging-Organizer/dp/B00475AUJA/ref=sr_1_8?s=home-garden&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1367780439&amp;sr=1-8&amp;keywords=over+the+door+shoe+organizer) versions because hanging space is so valuable. Ideally, look for ones where you can put both shoes in one slot. [This is the one I have](http://www.amazon.com/Shoes-Away-Hanging-Shoe-Organizer/dp/B000HJGBYI/ref=sr_1_14?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1338903047&amp;sr=8-14) and [I love it]( http://i.imgur.com/CoQAdQi.jpg). 
- Small cheap [bookshelves]( http://www.amazon.com/Furinno-99736EX-Bookcase-Bookshelf-Bookshelves/dp/B004S6JGR0/ref=sr_1_1?s=hi&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1338902849&amp;sr=1-1) are great for [boots]( http://i.imgur.com/kTXBYOC.jpg). Check your local craislist for cheapies.
- Some people love keeping their original shoe boxes, but this violates tip 3.
  
**Bags:**  

- Stuff bags with tissue to keep their shape. When using a bag, leave tissue as [holding space]( http://i.imgur.com/jh1Elu3.jpg).
- Sit them [on a shelf]( http://i.imgur.com/4Y9KQKm.jpg) rather than hanging them to prevent handles from [stretching out]( http://www.handbagheaven.com/blog/handbag-storage-how-to-maintain-your-purses-condition/3146/).
- Use [bookends] (http://www.amazon.com/Universal-Economy-Bookends-Standard-Heavy/dp/B001E6CT8A/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1338902573&amp;sr=8-1) to keep them up. I [built my own]( http://i.imgur.com/jh1Elu3.jpg).
- If you must hang, use an [over the door coat rack](http://www.amazon.com/Spectrum-68500-Over-The-Door-Multi-Hook-Accents/dp/B001945QL4/ref=rec_dp_1) or [this handy thing]( http://www.amazon.com/Jokari-06518-Hanging-Purse-Rack/dp/B000NBV9CO/ref=sr_1_1?s=home-garden&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1338903233&amp;sr=1-1) (on the other side of the door from your shoes) to hang bags, and even hats. Potentially keep some of these hooks open (tip 4).
- For less often used bags, create a drawer out of a long [boot]( http://i15.photobucket.com/albums/a357/sweetcontemplation/Beauty/boots_in_box.jpg) [box]( http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/p480x480/524749_505781736126125_1057819745_n.jpg). Line them up in the box, and slide it into a shelf – great for deep shelves (tip 5).
- I love having a junk bowl/[box]( http://i.imgur.com/cWwkJeE.jpg)/space for the things that I often but not always keep in my purse like hand sanitizer or a different sized wallet.
  
**Other Accessories:**  

- Hang scarves on [towel racks]( http://www.amazon.com/Decko-Products-38120-Towel-12-Inch/dp/B000UETBII/ref=sr_1_1?s=home-garden&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1367793608&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=towel+rod) – you can get one for less than $4 at your local home improvement store. I have two on the [inside of a closet door]( http://i.imgur.com/PTtV2Co.jpg), but have also had this hanging over a boot bookcase (see above) on the wall before. 
- For [belts]( http://i.imgur.com/0UxrlW0.jpg), [jewelry]( http://i.imgur.com/tF10yFG.jpg), [sunglasses]( http://i.imgur.com/OCMfK0v.jpg), and basically everything else ever, buy some [screw in hooks]( http://www.amazon.com/16-PC-1-5-Metal-Cup-Hooks/dp/B006IMJ59Q/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1367793748&amp;sr=8-5&amp;keywords=screw+in+hooks) in bulk at the home improvement store, and leave no wall or cabinet space uncovered. (Tips 1 &amp; 5) These are also very handy in the kitchen. They work best if you drill a hole first.
- Corral smaller items into open [boxes, jars]( http://i.imgur.com/ICpbTXK.jpg), and [cups]( http://i.imgur.com/Uov4lxL.jpg) purchased at thrift stores.
- Items that you intend to use infrequently can be hidden away in [boxes]( http://i.imgur.com/9UJZz8c.jpg). Those are Ikea, and hold travel organization tools, special occasion undies, and hats. 
  
**Creating More Space:**  

- Buy an [armoire](http://www.homedepot.com/p/t/100580672?catalogId=10053&amp;langId=-1&amp;keyword=wardrobe&amp;storeId=10051&amp;N=5yc1v&amp;R=100580672#.UYbmfaKG2jM) - [that’s what I did!](http://i.imgur.com/ONXHgDW.jpg).
- Are you handy? [Build a closet in a corner]( http://www.wikihow.com/Build-a-Closet)! 
- Only kind of handy? Get a stud-finder, drill, [closet brackets]( http://www.homedepot.com/p/t/100003620?productId=100003620&amp;storeId=10051&amp;langId=-1&amp;catalogId=10053&amp;ci_sku=100003620&amp;cm_mmc=shopping-_-googleads-_-pla-_-100003620&amp;ci_gpa=pla#.UYbnD6KG2jM), a shelf and closet rod. [Install brackets]( http://woodworking.about.com/od/woodworkingplansdesigns/ss/UtilityShelves.htm), add shelf on top, slip  rod into place (that’s what she said). Beware of how much your wardrobe weighs; you may need more than two of those brackets. Note: I once installed just the shelf, then had a towel rod underneath for scarves, and below was the boots bookshelf. 
- Get a [freestanding rack](http://www.amazon.com/Alera-Wire-Shelving-Garment-Black/dp/B004I2IFGM/ref=pd_sim_hg_2). I have one in my pantry for coats. Whatever, it works. 
  
  
Many of the photos are of my current storage situation which includes [two separate closets]( http://i.imgur.com/qw6TPUU.jpg) and an [enormous armoire]( http://i.imgur.com/ONXHgDW.jpg), so I left plenty of [unfilled space]( http://i.imgur.com/IwXWcPH.jpg). However, I will soon be moving to a smaller apartment where I will have one dresser and half of a closet!   

So tell me, what other tips do you have for closet organization and space saving (or creating)?

I thought it might be fun to share our own hidden hints and tips - the things that go on under or in our outfits that help everything fit better, feel better, look smoother, hold together for the day and so on. In particular the things that are hidden, and probably not noticeable and so some of us might not have thought of them for our own outfits. I don't think there is anything too obvious for this thread!

One of my own is that in winter, when I'm layering tanks and tees under dresses/skirts and wearing tights, I tuck my bottom layer right into my tights. 

I find it helps me with smoother lines and helps that bottom layer stay in place and not slip around. 

That, and, I get to feel like a super hero until I put my frock on (but I'm still a super hero underneath!)

I look forward to picking up some tips I'd never thought of.

^(If you're wondering what happened to June's installment, short story, I broke my laptop and sort of forgot about it. I'll add it later.)

Before we go on, I would just like to thank /u/wumumo for [writing us a script that automatically gathered the top posts of each WAYWT](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1ep7fp/simple_questions_may_20th/ca2i8d1).

Again, the criteria was a score of over 50. The code messed up this time so I had to add half of these by hand ^(I hate everything) so the formatting is sort of inconsistent later.

My attempt: http://i.imgur.com/MXsfvtl.jpg Edit: brighter picture http://i.imgur.com/bGDFEsi.jpg


I'll preface this with: I have no idea what I'm doing! I don't actually dress like this, other than a proclivity for grey and black. But I do love the look. I love the structure and drapiness, I love the use of subtle textures to differentiate the mostly monochromatic greys and blacks, and mostly I love how cool and weird and futuristic it look. And the hoods. I love me some hoods.


My outfit was difficult to put together, mostly because I own very few clothes with any unusual structure or length. I ended up slapping together a detachable hood from a coat, two hairbands I used as the face mask, two belts that are awkwardly tied together in the back, and boots with a broken sole. Not really street-ready, haha. I'm least happy with the plaid shirt, because although it's hard to see in the picture, it kinda just looked like an out of place plaid shirt -- but it has the most interesting collar of any clothes I own, so I ran with it.


So -- discussion, anyone? Love it or hate it, and why? Constructive criticism is of course welcome on my outfit, or the inspiration. I would also love to see some of you try to put together your own goth ninja outfit, I had a blast doing it so join in!",[Inspiration],False,self,t5_2s8o5,1373473375.0,guide,,True,t3_1i0emk,http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1i0emk/alternative_styles_goth_ninja_inspiration_my/,

___
As part of the moderator's efforts to broaden the scope of the FFA Community and encourage diversification of the subreddit we're making an attempt to expand the sidebar and bring it more in-line with the quantity of information offered by our male subreddit-in-arms, MFA. Unlike them, we want to avoid being proscriptive; female fashion is far more varied, and women tend to be more educated than men when it comes to knowing how items should fit, patterns should match, etc. 

With that said, we're happy to present to you


An Introduction to Designer Fashion
---
___
To many, the phrase ""designer clothing"" calls to mind scenes from *The Devil Wears Prada* and *Pretty Woman*; it's associated with [snooty shopkeeps](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9cP-1kC3So), [hard-to-wear](http://drumardar.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/161837_f260.jpg) or [outlandish outfits](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_C4-72pO-2QY/TTbZnb957rI/AAAAAAAAAPQ/5JOlwhWT_Oo/s640/garth+pughh.jpg), and [seemingly arbitrary decisions about what's ""trending"" from one season to the next](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LVptO7o4L8&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=109s). For others, it's a reminder of the 00 supermodels of the 90s and seen as inaccessible to anyone with a less than perfect physique.

These views are wrong.

That is not to say there's not a kernel of truth to these thoughts - they certainly have their basis in reality - but that they reflect a certain lack of awareness about the subject. Just as many a viewing of a Pollock or Mondrian has elicited comments of ""My five year old could do this"" or ""it's just colouring inside the lines!"", some level of knowledge is required to appreciate how a garment goes from thought, to runway, to retailer. We hope this guide will provide you with that information and spur a further interest or, if nothing else, introduce you to a new topic
___
Two Seasons, Four Cities
---
___
The fashion calendar revolves around two major seasons: **Autumn/Winter** and **Spring/Summer**. The former may in some cases be referred to as Fall/Winter. The beginning and end of each season is marked by Fashion Weeks in the fashion ""capitals"" of Paris, London, Milan, and New York \[[2](There are others, but the major ones are of the most import)\]. Typically the seasons are shortened to either **AW** or **SS** when used in conjunction with a year, i.e an Autumn/Winter 2009 collection by Yohji Yamamoto might be written as YY AW09.

With womenswear Spring/Summer shows typically occur in September and Fall/Winter shows happen in February. To stay up to date on what's happening sites such as [NowFashion](http://nowfashion.com) offer live photo uploads during shows and publish the full show schedules about a week in advance. They also have an extensive archive of past season shows and lookbooks. Alternatives include [Style.com](http://www.style.com/), [NYMag's Fashion Section](http://nymag.com/fashion/), and [The FashionSpot Forums](http://forums.thefashionspot.com/). 

For photos of runway shows dating back to 2001, [Vogue UK](http://vogue.co.uk) is an excellent resource. If you are looking for shows prior to that, you will primarily be limited to whatever Google produces and [FirstView](http://firstview), a subscription service for runway photography; they are akin to the Getty Images of the Fashion world.

Additionally, an increasing number of designers are producing collections between the seasons, with Resort preceding Spring/Summer and pre-Fall proceeding Spring/Summer. While there is no fixed schedule for these, they tend to start roughly three months after the main season.
___
Couture v. Prêt-à-porter
---
___
Runway shows are divided into two categories. These are Prêt-à-Porter, or Ready to Wear, and Haute Couture, literally ""high sewing"".

As its name implies, ready to wear shows are comprised of items that will be sold to stores as is, or ""ready to wear"". Shows are a designer's way of premiering their work to the world, and the looks put together are intended to convey a message or give the viewer deeper insight into the designer's aesthetic universe. This lends to the misconception that all designer clothing is ""outlandish"" or ""absurd"". However, in most cases it's not expected that people will wear looks from the show straight onto the street. For an excellent example of the contrast between on-the-street and on-the-runway looks, compare a look from Rick Owen's most recent [Fall/Winter 2011 Show](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/9061771/FFA%20Fashion/AW2011%20-%20Rick%20Owens%20-%2029.jpg) to [a streetstyle photo of it](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/9061771/FFA%20Fashion/im%20koo%20rick%20example.jpg). [Other examples](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/9061771/FFA%20Fashion/divinitius%20rick%20example.jpg). One designer well known for presenting [highly practical, workable looks](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/wilr1h64r1omwgy/7sU_BYIQ4r) is Phoebe Philo, who is currently the head designer of Céline.

Haute Couture is very different. To be an official courtier, a house must be legally ordained by the French government. Only ""those companies mentioned on the list drawn up each year by a commission domiciled at the Ministry for Industry are entitled to avail themselves"" as members of the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture. The conditions for membership are as follows:

* Design made-to-order for private clients, with one or more fittings.

* Have a workshop (atelier) in Paris that employs at least fifteen people full-time.

* Must have 20 full time technical people in at least one atelier or workshop.

* Each season (i.e., twice a year), present a collection to the Paris press, comprising at least thirty-five runs/exits with outfits for both daytime wear and evening wear.

Garments are made by hand, each one an extermely intricate and unique piece. Haute Couture is the way in which designers and houses demonstrate their vision unchecked by concerns over large scale manufacture or their ability to sell a garment to the mass-market. At present, all of the haute couture houses also produce ready-to-wear collections.

Boutiques, Webstores, Hunting Grails
---
___
Should you find a piece you are interested in purchasing you may find yourself stymied by the complexity of doing so. While the largest houses, such as  Dior, Prada, Balenciaga, et al have their own flagship Locations, they will also sell a subset of their line in upscale department stores such as Barneys, Nordstrom, and Saks. Smaller brands are usually found at boutiques and lack their own storefronts or webshop. 

Further complicating matters, If you check a designer's website they will often list their stockists, both online and those with a physical presence. A few cool boutiques with decent web presence in the US are:

* [Acrimony in SF](http://www.shopacrimony.com/)
* [Aloha Rag in HI](http://www.aloharag.com)
* [Totokaelo in Seattle](http://totokaelo.com/)
* [Bonnie and Clyde's in Chicago](http://www.bonnieandclydes.com/) \[ [*](Temporarily closed) \]
* [Opening Ceremony in LA &amp; NY](http://www.openingceremony.us/)
* [OakNYC](http://www.oaknyc.com/)


For Canada (mix of web/retail locations):

* [Ssense](http://www.ssense.com/)
* [Roden Gray](http://www.rodengray.com/)
* [Haven](http://havenshop.ca/)
* [reborn](http://reborn.ws)

In Europe it is easier to just ring up a brand's flagship and speak with an SA to order an item. For those who prefer to shop online, the follow sites are quite good (any suggestions for additions would be mcuh appreciated):

* [LN-CC](http://www.ln-cc.com/)
* [Layers](http://www.layerslondon.com/)

Not to be forgotten are the largest online shops:

* [ForwardForward](http://www.forwardforward.com/fw/DesignerIndex.jsp?d=Womens)
* [The Corner](http://www.thecorner.com/)
* [Luisa via Roma](http://www.luisaviaroma.com/)
* [Net-a-Porter \(NAP)](http://www.net-a-porter.com/)
* [YOOX](http://yoox.com)
* [The Outnet](http://www.theoutnet.com/)


These are not exhaustive lists but a jumping off point. Google will be your friend, as will sites like [ShopStyle](http://www.shopstyle.com/) that provide clothing focused search, or [FarFetch](http://www.farfetch.com/), who many boutiques outsource their online shopping to.

Should all those explorations turn up nothing, a very likely occurence if the piece you are searching for is from an older season, you can turn to eBay.

I chopped my hair off from [boob-length to pixie](http://i.imgur.com/kxvWfWc.png) and was surprised by the transformation my wardrobe took. 

I think I relied a lot on my long hair to pull my look together — knowing that I could throw on a V-neck t-shirt and some jeggings and call it a day since I looked conventionally feminine. As soon as I chopped off 10 inches, my style became [more bold](http://i.imgur.com/9nP4yuK.jpg), edgy, and (surprisingly) androgynous. Now that I have a chin-length bob with blunt bangs, I steer more towards a monochromatic color palette, leather, and lipstick.

1373290013.0,128,self.femalefashionadvice,1hv1pa,The Formality Level of Your Office or Interview,thethirdsilence,143,15,83,http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1hv1pa/the_formality_level_of_your_office_or_interview/,"As you may have noticed, whenever someone asks whether something is appropriate for the office on FFA, one of the top voted comments is usually a comment asking OP for more information about her office. This could seem deeply frustrating—why aren’t there hard and fast rules in women’s business fashion?   What is appropriate is contextual, and in this post, I will review some contextual factors that will help you determine what is appropriate for the office. 

Women’s office attire can be seen as along a spectrum:

Suits &gt; suiting separates mixed with non-suits &gt; traditional business casual &gt; khakis, chinos, and tees &gt; jeans

Within this spectrum, there are several other variables that could shape your clothing options. If you work in customer service, people in your office may prefer warmer, friendlier color palettes. If you are in a creative industry, you may have more room for self-expression (colorful suits and funky cuts or skinny as opposed to straight leg jeans) than you do in banking. 

Factors that dictate formality:

-**Location**: some cities are more conservative than others. In general, businesswear on the East Coast and in the Midwest is more formal than on the West Coast. Color is more acceptable in the South than in other places, but hemlines may tend to be more conservative.  *Location is an extremely important factor in determining dress code* and advice for the East Coast may not be generalizable to the West Coast. My husband works in the tech industry in our mid-Atlantic city, and suits are mandatory, whereas everyone wears jeans to their West Coast branch.  Additionally, the rules may be different in big cities than in small towns—if you interview for a nonprofit job in DC, you had better wear a suit, whereas khakis might work well in Burlington, VT. 
 
(As you may notice, this post is fairly US focused. Business dress conventions are different in other countries—trending more casual in Europe and more formal in East Asia, for instance, but I don’t feel qualified to comment on global business dress codes. I would especially welcome international readers to weigh in on how true any advice I provide this week is for their location.)

-**Industry**: some industries are much more formal than others, and some industries encourage more individual expression in the dress code.  Top finance, law, and consulting firms (“white shoe” firms) as well as folks in law who interview for clerkships, are the most formal. Government, pharmacueticals, accounting, and law and business jobs are next in terms of formality. Generally, nonprofits, teaching and foundations are a little less formal than that.  There may be greater room for creativity in marketing, social media, advertising, and publishing. In academia, it depends on your focus—economics and business departments trend more formal than studio art, for instance. Tech and engineering tends to be a bit less formal. 

-**Your Role/Your Goal**- You’ve probably heard the old adage “dress for the job you want, not the job you have.” If you have a summer job filing papers to make money and don’t care about building connections in the field, you can be less formal than if you want to grow within the company or field. Additionally, if your work is client or customer facing, you may need to be dressier than if you are working in a backroom. If you are more junior within the company, you also may want to err on the safe side in your clothing choices. In my old job, we once had an informally planned “hoodie Friday.” I had gotten promoted three weeks before this event, and my boss, who had been with the employer for 8 years, said “Third, I’m going to wear a hoodie tomorrow but I don’t think you should.” To some extent, you need to prove yourself professionally before you can earn the freedom to push workplace dress norms.

**But I’m still not sure how formal my work place is.**

Here are some other cues that may help you:

-How do the other people in your workplace dress? Here, look for patterns, don’t look for the least formal, least appropriate thing any one has ever worn to the office (But my coworker wears sheer things all the time!). Look for patterns and look for role models. If you work with mostly men, you can still take queues about your own dress from their dress (I will review this more in Thursday’s post on troubleshooting office problems).  For instance, if men wear suits and ties every day, the office is NOT business casual.

 *A cardigan is not the female equivalent of a suit jacket.* Cardigans can be a useful business casual staple but are not formal enough for a workplace where men wear suits every day. 

(I use men’s dress as a reference point throughout this guide. I know this could be irritating—why should women’s dress be defined with men’s dress as a reference point? However because the degrees of formality are more clear, it may be a helpful clue.)

-What is your official dress code? It may help you clarify what is expected in your workplace.

-Ask your manager or a more senior coworker what is appropriate. Any manager would rather lay out expectations than lecture or send home an employee. 

 -Who do you meet with? First, if you are collaborating with other offices, you should be dressed to the same degree of formality as the people you will meet with. In my old job, I sometimes met with lawyers and government officials, and wore suits. Other days, I met with folks who worked at nonprofits and felt free to wear more colors and patterns. When I met with farmers I tended to dress down a bit.
Second, if you are meeting with other people, what is your role? If you want to present yourself as an expert providing a service to them, you should dress like one. If you are presenting yourself as a friendly peer, less formal clothing may be helpful.  

If you work in client-facing work with marginalized communities, you may enjoy these two previous FFA threads about dress code: [one]( http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1fq01z/confused_about_internship_dress_code/) [two](gah I can’t find the second one, it might have been in Simple Questions a while ago—let me know if anyone remembers)

I've really enjoyed looking at inspiration albums focused on a single article of clothing in the past (e.g. Nike Freespiration album the other day!), I think it's interesting to see all the different ways an item can be interpreted, especially a really simple one like a button-down because there are so many different things you can do with it.

However, this is definitely not intended to be an exhaustive representation of all the ways to wear a button-down. I excluded: 

* extremely preppy fits ~~although Jenna Lyons is in there~~. Button down + sweater + chunky necklace is kind of formulaic (nothing wrong with that, I just wanted to make room for things that were a bit more creative and outside the norm!)

* anything that was explicitly ""officewear"", although some of these could probably pass for business casual

* oversized button-downs worn in Mediterranean vacation shoots as beach cover-ups and the many different tumblr-esque iterations thereof because . . . nah. 

I looked for things that played with the structural elements of the shirt. I really love the clean line the placket creates when it's buttoned all the way up, and I think there are a lot of especially interesting things you can do with that. There's a lot of menswear in there, since I love menswear and because the button-down obviously lends itself to that aesthetic, but hopefully I managed to cover a pretty broad swath of styles, with the unifying element being a certain purposefulness with which the shirt is worn, whether it's the focus or just a supporting element of a fit.

1340919657.0,126,self.femalefashionadvice,vrgrm,"Dispelling the Myths of Fashion, Episode One: The Myth of In/Out
",FFA_Moderator,137,11,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/vrgrm/dispelling_the_myths_of_fashion_episode_one_the/,"Hello, ladies (and gents).

For a long time, I have been noticing that there seems to be a huge, pervasive myth that is perpetuated around this subreddit—the myth of “in” and “out.”

You’ve seen it:

* ""Are _________ back in again?""

* ""Is it okay for me to wear _________, or are they out?""

* ""Are _________ last season?""

* ""_______ is the new ________.""

I figure this perception of fashion is propagated by newcomers to fashion who are basing their perception on depictions of the industry on film and television. Catty editors, designers, and models. Frantic rushing to get their hands on the new “it” item. Scorn and disgust at those wearing something a collection old. 

    “Don’t-a stomp your little last season Prada shoes at me, honey.”

            – Legally Blonde

In reality, though items do *trend*, fashion isn’t so fickle. No one is going to insult you for wearing jeans you bought last year. No one is going to stop you in the street and chastise you for wearing last season’s Prada pumps. (And, the harsh reality is that barely any people in this subreddit are wearing designer clothing to begin with—so “seasons” barely even matter. It’s easier to recognize a past-season Givenchy dog shirt than a graphic tee by Merona from Target.)

(The notable deviation from this rule is vintage clothing, which is an entirely different animal that we will perhaps tackle another day.)

Certain styles and items experience fluctuations in popularity. Bob haircuts, cowboy boots, wide-legged pants, etc. Instead of focusing on whether or not what you want/have is “in season” or “in style,” you should be focusing on:

1. Whether it **works for you**: Far too many people force themselves into trends that simply do not work for them. We call them “fashion victims.” Blunt bangs, undercuts, and platinum blonde hair don’t work for everyone. Neither do flared pants, crop tops, ostrich pants, or John Lennon sunglasses. Know yourself, and stick to your guns. Don’t blindly follow every trend that peaks in popularity.

2. Whether it has reached **the point of saturation**: Sometimes it’s probably just too late to jump on the bandwagon. And a lot of times, you don’t want to jump on the bandwagon because it is packed like a sardine can with fashion victims (*see #1 above*). There comes a point in many trends’ lives where it seems like *everyone* is doing it. This is the point when you should decide if you would rather be a statistic or be yourself. Recent examples of trends that have are reaching or have passed their peaks are ombre, half-shaved heads, and Jeffrey Campbell Litas.

Don’t get me wrong—it’s okay to rock maxi skirts (or any of the other above-mentioned trends) if you want to, despite the fact that your tumblr dashboard is saturated with them. Just do so *consciously,* and do it for yourself.

In conclusion: Don’t fall victim to the exaggerations of “in” and “out.” Don’t worry about wearing your older purchases (if they still look good). And most importantly, stay true to yourself, your taste, and your personal style. Draw inspiration and take heed of trends, but don’t become a victim to them.

Gone are the days of puffy sleeves on brides and sea foam green monstrosities on bridesmaids. Weddings have evolved from a highly structured event into a unique event tailored to each specific couple. They range from super casual backyard barbeques to extremely formal black tie events held in ballrooms. Brides are no longer sticking to white dresses; They’re wearing red, silver, and every other color out there. With so many things changing in the bridal industry, it can become quite confusing for a person trying to find a dress to wear as a guest of a wedding. I’m hoping this guide will clear up any questions you have about shopping for dresses to wear to a wedding. 

When going to a wedding, you should aim to look classy and happy. You should not wear anything that may take attention away from the bride and groom. Keep in mind that there will likely be older family members in attendance and you should be wearing something that will not offend them. This is the type of occasion where you should err on the side of caution and try not to rock the boat. 

Your ensemble will largely be determined by how formal the wedding is and by what the couple says on the invitation. The four main wedding types are listed below along with what is appropriate to wear to each type. I’m using dresses from David’s Bridal as examples because most of you are American and this is a brand that most of you have access to. 

**Black Tie**

* Wear a formal floor-length gown
  
* Furs are acceptable 
 
* Wear glitzy jewelry
  
* Shiny fabric is preferred but not mandatory
  
* Opera gloves are acceptable 

* A short train is acceptable

**Formal**

-	Wear a formal floor-length gown
-	Shiny fabric is preferred but not mandatory
 
[Example](http://www.davidsbridal.com/Product_V-Neck-Sleeveless-Chiffon-Column-Dress-VW360027_Bridal-Party-Bridesmaids-All-Bridesmaid-Dresses) 	

**Semi-Formal*** 

* Wear a cocktail-length dress

* Wear either shiny or matte fabric

[Example](http://www.davidsbridal.com/Product_Short-Charmeuse-Dress-with-Lace-Illusion-84618_Bridal-Party-Bridesmaids-All-Bridesmaid-Dresses) 

**Casual** 

* Wear a cocktail-length dress
* Matte fabric is preferred but not mandatory

[Example](http://www.davidsbridal.com/Product_Short-Crinkle-Chiffon-Dress-with-Front-Cascade-F14847_Bridal-Party-Bridesmaids-All-Bridesmaid-Dresses) 

**Venue and Time** 

The venue and time of day have a very small influence on your outfit. It’s really just the bridesmaids dresses that have to be a specific style for the venue and time of day. For a garden or beach wedding you should try to wear something in a more lightweight fabric like georgette or chiffon, as well as wearing a softer color. I do not recommend wearing a dress with a train to a garden/beach ceremony as you will be outdoors and the train will get dirty. 

**Colors**

Wearing black has become more acceptable in recent years. If you’re going to wear black to a wedding, it should be a nighttime wedding and you should try to add some colorful accessories. Red is acceptable to wear to a wedding as long as the dress is not revealing or clingy. 

In regards to ivory, it should only be worn if the couple specifically asks their guests to wear it. Turning up in an ivory dress without asking the bride first is a major fashion faux pas and it is extremely disrespectful. If you’re unsure whether your dress is too close to ivory, you should just skip it and wear something else. As I said above, err on the side of caution. 

**Length**

I’m not going to make any silly rules about the dress touching your knees or being a certain amount of inches. The thing to keep in mind about length is that you’re going to be dancing. Wear a dress that you can dance in comfortably without having to worry about exposing yourself.

**Straps vs. Strapless**

As mentioned above, you will be dancing. Strapless dresses are perfectly acceptable as long as you wear a bra that is supportive enough. If you are going to a religious wedding in a house of worship, you should definitely have your shoulders covered by a wrap, cardigan, or long sleeved dress. 

**Neckline**

Use common sense for this one. Your dress should be tasteful but not matronly. It’s fine to show a little bit of cleavage as long as you make sure that your nipples will not pop out and your cleavage will not steal the attention away from your beautiful face.

**Shoes**

There is no rule regarding the height of your heels. You can wear 6 inch heels if you feel like it as long as you are able to dance in them. I recommend wearing a thicker heel if the ceremony is outdoors as stilettos will sink into grass or sand and you run the risk of toppling over. 

**Religious Weddings**

Wear something more conservative to a religious ceremony. You should cover your shoulders and wear a dress that falls just below the knees. There will be specific dress codes for each religious group and I can’t name them all. This is something that you will have to google. 

**Further Notes**

Every wedding is different and you know your friends better than I do. The things that I have said in this guide are not set in stone; you should use your judgement. You’re welcome to pm me if you are still unsure about a certain dress. Make sure you include the formality of the wedding and as many details as you can. 

Edit: I was asked to include more casual dresses since that is what most people are looking for.

Once or twice a week, I'd like to post an article of clothing from a website, and you guys tell me how YOU would wear it.  This is not ""How *should I* wear this?""  It's ""How would *you guys* wear this?""  I think it would be a great way to sharpen our skills working with pieces of clothing you wouldn't normally consider.  Sometimes I'll pick something wacky/crazy and you get to figure out how to make it work, and sometimes I'll pick something basic and you get to dress it up.  Sometimes I may even throw in an extra (optional) condition to make it challenging, like how would you wear this: in the summer?  on a date?  if you could only pick two other items?  if you were in a hurry that morning?  etc.

Proposed rules:


* Sometimes you won't like the item chosen.  Maybe it's not your style.  But that's the point.  You may either abstain, or you may rise to the challenge.  You can also pretend you're putting the outfit on someone else, whatever.
* Downvote sparingly.  If someone gives an honest answer for how they would actually wear it, I see no reason for downvotes.  Perhaps ask them what their inspiration is or what they're going for.
* Are you a fashion newbie?  You should definitely participate!  Don't feel like you have to sit out because you aren't an 'expert.'  Give it a shot, and then maybe add, ""... but I'm new to this.  What do you think?""  Then another commenter can help you with the details.  :)
* Men, feel free to join in, of course.
* If you have a photo of your inspiration, link it!  If you don't, that's cool, too.

I'm open to more suggestions for rules and such.  What do you guys think?  I think it could be fun and could fuel for discussion, and I think it could help us be more alert about trends and whatnot.  I look forward to playing this if enough people show interest.

So I thought I'd now share ^(partly because I'm having trouble sleeping) some designer pieces culled from Barney's Warehouse and Last Call Neiman Marcus—pieces I feel are really cool but not right for me or my shopping priorities right now. The goal is really to encourage FFAers to see that **a lot of high-priced brands can be quite accessible and reasonably priced if you're patient and wait for end-of-season sales**. But maybe you'll find something cool to cop as well.  (＾▽＾)

I love the idea of it, and decided to create three different wardrobes in this same style (links below). The idea is that you can create an outfit by looking at the grid up-down, left-right, and diagonally (for a total of 10 outfits).

One caveat: this is in no way meant to be a prescriptive guide, and I'm not telling you that you need all these items to create a mix-and-match wardrobe. It is a fun exercise though, and it helped me to create a wardrobe that was rather cohesive. Most tops will go with most bottoms, will go with most shoes, etc. Again, not prescriptive, but more like inspiration. 

Please feel free to create your own and link below. Finally, any criticism is welcome!

You should see the horrible things I do to my naturally curly hair.

Anyway, I'm 5'4 and a size 6/8 with a fairly intense hourglass (38-26-38). I spent a sadly large amount of time in my early 20s angrily yelling at my body in Free People dressing rooms, refusing to give up on those lovely unstructured, ruffly dresses and tops that were so popular in 2005-ish. But no matter what sizes I tried, or how much weight I lost, they never hung ""right"" on my body and I always looked like a 20 pound heavier, more rectangular version of myself and less like the hippie-chic girl I knew I was on the inside, man.

I moved on and worked on compromising. Maybe I would occasionally buy a top or dress from Anthropologie but I always made sure to pair it with a structured blazer, just to be sure people still knew i had a waist. However, I'm pretty sure I spent my mid-20s dressed like the CEO of an organic co-op instead of achieving any of the laid back style I was actually going for.

Now I'm older and smarter, and have found this community. All of these things lead me to believe that I have the necessary resources to buy a few ""boho"" style looks that will work for a lady with my measurements. Plus it's summer and I live in SoCal now, so I've decided that this is the perfect time to experiment.

I've come across two interesting minimalist wardrobe challenges I thought I'd share. As our community is frequently preoccupied with buying wisely and growing our wardrobes in a frugal and considered manner, it might be good to talk about a challenge framework for actually *utilizing* our wardrobes and the pieces we buy.

This post will cover:

* Why you might want to do a minimalist wardrobe challenge
* Project 333 (wear only 33 items for 3 months)
* The 30x30 Remix (30 outfits from only 30 items)
* Suggested rules for what counts as an ""item"" and what's a freebie

If you're at all interested in the topic, please share your opinions and thoughts on these challenges! If you know of similar challenges or relevant blog posts that others might be interested in, consider sharing those as well.

This is somewhat complementary to the [French Wardrobe](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/15yf1z/the_french_wardrobe_thread_2curating_a_wardrobe/) buying philosophy I've previously talked about.

***

## Why do a minimalist wardrobe challenge?

**One of the problems endemic to fashion/style communities online is that we get used to the idea that we always have to shop more, cop more, *have* more.** Fashion mags are relentless in suggesting that you need to constantly buy to update your wardrobe for current fashions and trends (understandably so, since it keeps the fashion industry going). Fashion bloggers, by and large, talk a *lot* about new items they've acquired and showcase brand-new outfits all the time. I feel it's easy to forget that we're seeing a very artificial impression of an ideal wardrobe or someone else's wardrobe—one that's based around constant novelty.

The reality is that many of us *won't* have gigantic, constantly refreshed wardrobes. So why do a minimalist wardrobe challenge?

* **To see an alternative to buying more and feeling dissatisfied with what we already have**. We've talked before about how [participating in the fashion community online makes it easier to spend](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1bixva/the_dilemma_of_frequenting_fashion_forumsblogs/), and I think it's easy for us to get caught up in feeling like we're not close to where we want to be stylistically. But odds are many of us have tons of garments we're just not utilizing enough or haven't experimented with enough, and doing one of these challenges might give us an opportunity to reevaluate the possibilities in our wardrobe.
* **To figure out what pieces in our wardrobes matter the most.** It's nice to be reminded of the types of garments (or specific garments!) that heavily influence our wardrobe and are perhaps most useful and versatile. If you come out of a challenge feeling that you had a distinct lack of blouses or your shoes weren't particularly versatile, that might inform your future buying decisions. If you come out of a challenge realizing how heavily you rely on black pants or cardigans, then that's also an interesting observation about your buying priorities.
* **To help us pare down our wardrobes and consumption.** It may help to be reminded that we don't need *that much* clothing to create a good amount of variety in our outfits—as long as the outfits are well-chosen. 
* **Restrictions can allow for greater creativity**. It's easy to fall into the trap of having tons of clothing and feeling like you have nothing to wear—having forced restrictions might allow you to see more possibilities in what you own.

So now that I've introduced the topic, here are the two challenges for you to consider!

***

## Project 333

**The challenge is to wear only 33 items for 3 months.** This could be great if you're trying to pare down your wardrobe significantly and want a test period to work within the challenge restrictions and get used to a small wardrobe. It's a bit more of a long-term commitment (the other challenge is shorter if you feel nervous!).

Obviously, for the purposes of choosing your items, this is *much* easier if you're working within a fairly small temperature range. Choosing 3 months transitioning from winter to summer might be difficult and too limiting; if you do the challenge during F/W or S/S, it may be a little easier to plan things out.

Project 333 was started by a woman who writes a minimalist living blog, [Be More With Less](http://bemorewithless.com/). You can read about the challenge [here](http://theproject333.com/getting-started/).

## The 30x30 Remix

**The challenge is to create 30 different outfits out of 30 pieces**, *ideally* in about a month. This perhaps better for people who are seasonally limited. If you're looking mostly to discover new outfits and get some wear out of solid pieces that you don't use often enough, this could be an interesting challenge.

The 30x30 remix was started by the blogger behind [Kendi Everyday](http://www.kendieveryday.com/p/30x30-remix.html) (many other stylebloggers have done this challenge as well). Her blog shows examples of the pieces and outfits she did from her previous challenge attempts, so it's worth checking that out.

***

## The rules:

Project 333 has clearly defined rules; the 30x30 Remix doesn't. For the intent of the challenges (pushing yourself to discover the potential in a small wardrobe), I have assembled the following rules on what items count and don't count. You're of course free to modify them to suit your sartorial habits.

* **What counts**: clothing, outerwear and shoes.
* **What doesn't count**: accessories and jewelry, underwear, sleepwear and clothes you wear to lounge around at home, workout clothing. For women whose professional wardrobes *hardly* intersect with their casual/everyday wardrobes, I'd suggest having your exclusively-workwear pieces not count as well

Note: accessories and jewelry are counted as part of your 33 items in the official Project 333 rules—but my impression is that many FFAers, instead of buying too many of these things and using them frequently, *are still experimenting* with how to include scarves, necklaces, belts, &amp;c in their wardrobes.

How are people interacting with one another? What recurring threads are working or not? Are we following reddiquette? Are we living up to our mission? Are we being the best subreddit we can be? In this post, we'll explore a few problem areas we've noticed over the past few weeks and months, and will also give the community at large a place to voice their concerns or suggestions for the moderation team or other subscribers.

**On downvoting and reddiquette**
---
/u/PersonalShopper (RIP) disabled downvotes in the custom subreddit style; however, many users found workarounds (RES shortcuts, disabling CSS, using mobile platforms) and downvotes were as much of a problem as ever. In fact, the lack of downvotes led to confusion, more hurt feelings, and, we thought, abuse of the downvote as a feature. Some of you may have noticed, but downvotes were silently re-enabled a few weeks ago. While we hoped the community would continue in its normal fashion, it is obvious that we need to discuss a few specific points from Reddiquette in terms of how **not** to use the downvote button.

So, from the [Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette#wiki_in_regard_to_voting):

* **Don't mass downvote someone else's posts.** 
* **Don't upvote or downvote based just on the person that posted it.**

These should be fairly self-explanatory, but there are obvious examples of users who have attracted ""haters"" and receive many downvotes for every post, whether it is on- or off-topic, good advice or bad (not that downvotes should be used for bad advice - more on that later). This makes the community hostile, makes newcomers and oldtimers alike feel alienated and bullied, and is immature beyond belief. If you don't like someone, let them be. If you think someone's advice is bad, *explain to them why you disagree or let it be.* If a post is off-topic or offensive, use the [report button](http://i.imgur.com/SSar5AW.png) and also [message the moderators](http://i.imgur.com/x7KWU46.png) so we're notified of it.

**On giving and receiving criticism**
---
The name of this subreddit is Female Fashion *Advice.* While we've expanded into discussions of personal style, the fashion industry in general, and more, it's important to note that many, if not all users, approach this subreddit with the idea of giving advice in mind. With that being said, don't be offended if someone takes a critical eye to your advice, your outfit, your style, your whatever. If someone is being rude (meaning offensive - curtness, bluntness, and in general not sugarcoating everything does not qualify as being rude), respond reasonably and, again, feel free to take advantage of the report/message moderators functionalities. Take and give criticism like a reasonable, rational adult human - follow the golden rule and we should all be okay. No one here is a ""fashion nazi.""

**On novelty/parody accounts**
---
Novelty and parody accounts are, for better or worse, part of Reddit. These accounts are still expected to behave like all other Redditors - if someone is rude, offensive, off-topic, etc., using what is clearly a novelty account, you are still being reasonable by reporting their comments. While they can inject a wonderful dose of humor into our discussions, users should not hide behind novelty accounts in order to be rude or overly harsh, nor should they be used to target one person in particular. Again - behave like a reasonable, rational adult human. 

**On FFA as a ""safe space""**
---
A recent conversation about body type (and [""boyishness""](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1dfs0k/hey_ffa_can_we_stop_describing_womens_bodies_as/) in particular) led to many wondering - is FFA a ""safe space"" à la, say, /r/TwoXChromosomes? The answer is no. We expect contributors to act in a respectful, mature, reasonably politically correct way, but our intention is primarily to discuss fashion and fashion advice. Issues of body image and self-confidence are often tied up in issues much deeper than how we look on the surface, and this community is not designed to work through those deeper issues. You will likely be directed to a more appropriate subreddit if you're experiencing those issues, though we are always happy to help you change your style, dress for events, etc.

**On community and cliqueishness**
---
Many of the Moderators, Valued Advice Givers, and IRC regulars have friendly relationships with one another that can spill over into threads from time to time. Remember to treat those Redditors with whom you may have a friendly relationship with the same respect that you would treat someone else, and try to keep in-crowd jokes to a minimum. This can be very unwelcoming for newcomers or those who don't spend as much time hanging around FFA. It is our intention that the community be welcoming to all, and those who have been around the longest or the most can do a lot to make the community feel that way.

[Vero Moda sweater](http://imgur.com/a22jL) - although I usually gravitate towards simpler, more minimalist pieces, I enjoy the details of this sweater, like the asymmetrical buttons and elbow patches. It is also very warm for its weight, great for Canadian winters.

[Lord &amp; Taylor Cashmere Boyfriend Pullover] (http://resources.shopstyle.com/pim/3a/4d/3a4d4d314a0dfa4e58814cfb19b5f850.jpg) - picked this up for a really good price around Boxing Day, and have been wearing it frequently ever since.

They dress up and down equally well, and I reach for them very often for that reason.

Joe Fresh ponte pant/legging (as seen, poorly, in the Vero Moda photo) - I'm not sure what to call these, as they seem to bridge the gap between a ponte pant and a legging. They are generally treated as leggings though, just to be safe!

Here are two basic links that should help fatten up your shoe vocabulary:

[1](http://i.imgur.com/RhC8l.jpg) [2](http://i.imgur.com/DjvRf.jpg)

Now on to the nitty gritty.

****

There are many, many types of women’s shoes. This will by no means be an exhaustive list, but hopefully it will cover most of the average user’s shoe needs and questions. (No explanations of Vibram FiveFingers or Christian Louboutin ballerina heels here.)

**Types of shoes**

* Sandals: Typically, anything with an open, strappy upper. Heeled and wedge shoes can also be described as sandals. There are many styles of sandals, such as [flip flops](http://i.imgur.com/mFqtf.jpg) (with a simple strap and minimal design) or [gladiators](http://i.imgur.com/VPHKp.jpg) (involving multiple cross-straps that often extend upward past the ankle). Sandals are often embellished with jewels, braiding, multi-material straps, and other details.

* Boots: “Boots” is an all-encompassing category that includes many, many different styles. A boot is a general term that refers to any shoe that covers the entire upper of the foot, often including the ankle, the calf, and occasionally, the knee and thigh. Boots can also be heeled or wedged. Some types of boots are:

    [Riding boots](http://i.imgur.com/oVI7f.jpg): Usually minimalist in design; a smooth, unembellished shaft with maybe a buckle or two, reminiscent of equestrian styling (AKA… horse*riding*).

    [Rain boots/galoshes/wellies/whatever you want to call them](http://i.imgur.com/cc0lo.jpg): Pretty self-explanatory. Try to look for pairs with a thinner shaft (the part that covers the calf).

    [Booties](http://i.imgur.com/W30Qj.jpg): “Booties” is a descriptive word for boots with shorter shafts, either ending just below/at the ankle or slightly above. Can be heeled, wedged, or flat.

    [Combat boots](http://i.imgur.com/K1RYt.jpg): Think punk and rough and tumble. Combat boots are characterized by their military feel—rough construction, heavy look, and lacing. They pretty typically have a height that falls around mid-calf, but some brands like Dr. Martens make novelty pairs that extend very high on the leg.

    [Cowboy boots](http://i.imgur.com/iWmUe.jpg): Everyone knows what these are. They are usually high in the shaft (although some pairs come ankle-height) and pointy in the toe with a small heel. Almost always made of leather, often embellished with embroidery, laser cutting, studs, etc. 

    [Engineer boots](http://i.imgur.com/F08q0.jpg): Stereotypical of a “chunkier,” wider shape, with a looser shaft, a rounded toe, a strap across the bottom of the shaft, and a slight heel. Frye is a very popular brand for engineer boots. These are stereotypical motorcyclist boots.

    [Desert boots](http://i.imgur.com/1grsy.jpg): If you’ve ever visited MFA, this is the almighty desert boot. An acquired taste for sure, but a true menswear classic. Can look great with a play on feminine menswear if done with the appropriate amount of panache.

    [Chelsea boots](http://i.imgur.com/3uyex.jpg): A snug, mid-height boot characterized by its elastic siding. A staple of the 1960’s London mod rocker scene.

    ~~Uggs~~: Fuck Uggs.

* Heels: a huge umbrella term for any type of shoe with an elevated heel, whether the heel be ½” or 6” plus a platform. More on this later.

* Sneakers/athletic: A genre of shoes that includes running shoes (which should only be worn for exercise, I repeat, only worn while exercising), casual styles like [plimsolls](http://i.imgur.com/aGegk.jpg) (a lighter sneaker characterized by its canvas upper and rubber sole—very typical of spring and summer), [slip-ons](http://i.imgur.com/VFPta.jpg), more athletic/streetwear styles like [Nikes](http://i.imgur.com/PkpYK.jpg), and classics like good ol’ [Chuck Taylors](http://i.imgur.com/ELGHs.jpg).

* Flats: This is the section I’ve been dreading. There are just so many types of flats, both named and nameless. You’ve got your…
 
    [Classic ballerinas](http://i.imgur.com/LMqFn.jpg): BEWARE—though often touted as the “classic staple” of a woman’s shoe collection, ballerina flats are not flattering on most people; if you have more than even a slightly-above-average calf thickness, stay away.

    [Loafers](http://i.imgur.com/lrjrx.jpg): Laceless, comes in many styles (like the ubiquitous [penny loafer](http://i.imgur.com/x5mwd.jpg)--characterized by the vamp detailing you see here).

    [Moccasins](http://i.imgur.com/KdOva.jpg)

    [Boat shoes](http://i.imgur.com/4HN86.jpg)

    [Clogs](http://i.imgur.com/u07sW.jpg)

    [Oxfords](http://i.imgur.com/BzZFN.jpg)

Okay, so now that we’ve covered most of our bases, we’re going to move on to sole types.

****

**Types of soles**

* [Wedges](http://i.imgur.com/7FEan.jpg)

    Also, [flatform wedges](http://i.imgur.com/aVBni.jpg), in which the wedge stays of uniform height through the entire length of the shoe.

* [Heels](http://i.imgur.com/HF9b5.jpg): Come in various styles, such as…

    [Stiletto heels](http://i.imgur.com/wLRVz.jpg)

    [Chunky heels](http://i.imgur.com/IpQHs.jpg)

    [Kitten heels](http://i.imgur.com/9I1TY.jpg): Fancy name for very short heels—-very difficult to pull off.

* [Creepers](http://i.imgur.com/MLvuB.jpg): Adopted by a bunch of musical subcultures throughout recent history, and now making a trending comeback.

****

**Features**

Womens shoes also have many features. Here is a basic list of the most common features you will see:

* [Peeptoe](http://i.imgur.com/9eWVp.jpg): An opening at the toe

* [D’orsay](http://i.imgur.com/wcV9A.jpg): A shoe in which the heel and toe components are separate

* [Ankle strap](http://i.imgur.com/t3xH8.jpg): Self-explanatory (also, not flattering to those with substantial calves)

* [T-strap](http://i.imgur.com/GuIb3.jpg): Exactly as it sounds--a “T” shaped strap that wraps around the ankle and extends down the top of the foot to the toe

* [Pointed toe](http://i.imgur.com/CIrvW.jpg)

* [Platform](http://i.imgur.com/VKm07.jpg): The section under the toe; adds extra height without straining the foot

* [Sling back](http://i.imgur.com/cXl8K.jpg): A strap that extends around the heel on a shoe with no counter (very 90’s Ally McBeal; hard to pull off without looking dated)

* [Cap toe](http://i.imgur.com/N1Jso.jpg): A “cap” on the toe (obviously); can be in a contrast color or simply defined by broguing

* [Espadrille](http://i.imgur.com/KQZIm.jpg): A shoe with a sole made of rope (typically with a canvas upper, but not always). [Shown here on a flat](http://i.imgur.com/5BHVR.jpg)

* [Toe ring](http://i.imgur.com/zD2O9.jpg)

* [Slouch](http://i.imgur.com/geDVU.jpg): Ugh. See far below.

* [Saddle](http://i.imgur.com/baVbH.jpg): An oxford with a decorative panel in the middle of the shoe

* [Spectator](http://i.imgur.com/FsOvL.jpg): Sort of the opposite of the saddle shoe, utilizing contrasting panels typically on the toe and heel

* [Broguing](http://i.imgur.com/Dp9xk.jpg): Perforations

* [Monk strap](http://i.imgur.com/bx6pW.jpg) (double monk shown here): A strap and buckle that crosses the upper of a shoe

* [Mary jane](http://i.imgur.com/1lKgz.jpg): A shoe with a cross strap, lower than an ankle strap on a heel. A dowdy, juvenile, and nearly universally grotesque style of shoe, if we’re being honest here. [Example of a mary jane heel](http://i.imgur.com/DfCMW.jpg)

****

**Materials**

* [Leather](http://i.imgur.com/iQhxm.jpg)

* [Patent leather](http://i.imgur.com/qJgbj.jpg): A shiny, more rigid leather

* [Suede](http://i.imgur.com/dpa20.jpg): A type of leather with a different, softer napped texture made from the underside of an animal’s skin. Difficult to care for and easily damaged

* [Satin](http://i.imgur.com/IH2xa.jpg): A fabric with a shiny, glossy finish. Satin shoes should almost always be worn *only in formal situations *.

* [Rubber](http://i.imgur.com/cc0lo.jpg)

* [Mesh](http://i.imgur.com/G0awy.jpg)

* [Canvas](http://i.imgur.com/pYUrz.jpg)

* [Cork](http://i.imgur.com/sCQQp.jpg): Most often used as a sole material (For some reason, often paired with a patent leather upper--this is disastrous and should not be encouraged)

* ~~[Sweater](http://i.imgur.com/8NoEv.jpg):~~ HELL **NO**

****

**General Don’ts** (Major Don'ts in the general fashion community)

* [Slouch](http://i.imgur.com/geDVU.jpg): The absolute bane of women’s shoe’s existence. Somehow this style of shoe has gained huge traction within the general public, despite its extreme ugliness. Stay away.

* [Kitten heels](http://i.imgur.com/9I1TY.jpg): Unflattering for the legs and generally not very attractive at all

* Crocs (obviously)

* [Overly rounded toes](http://i.imgur.com/Rgdia.jpg): Look very juvenile and unflattering on any foot or leg shape

* Mary jane flats (see above)

* Running shoes (for obvious reasons)

* Uggs (no explanation necessary)

* [Flip-flops](http://i.imgur.com/mFqtf.jpg): Shouldn’t be worn except for functional reasons, AKA running outdoors to put out the trash or going to the beach

* [Ostentatious logoing](http://i.imgur.com/Fa6sG.jpg): Looks tacky and cheap

* [Comfort/ergonomic shoes](http://i.imgur.com/L92qX.jpg): You are sacrificing looks for comfort when there should be a happy medium

* [Over-embellished shoes](http://i.imgur.com/Ik8sR.jpg) ([Another example](http://i.imgur.com/dDV5T.jpg), and [another example](http://i.imgur.com/yymZP.jpg)): Self-explanatory

* Fur: You are not Flo-Rida’s girl

I don't have any negative opinions about women wearing pants, it's just not for me. 

 However, as the years go on I realize that most of my skirts I own are pretty frumpy and not very flattering. Somebody mentioned that I look like ""a Duggar girl"" the other day, and I guess that sums up my fashion sense pretty well. On a casual day like today, I have on a long denim skirt, a t-shirt and flip-flops. That's a pretty typical clothing choice for me. I guess that look is fine for a teenager, but i'm 26 now and I end up looking a lot younger than I really am because of that look.

I still want to maintain my religious convictions regarding my clothing choices, but still look stylish and pretty. The Muslim ladies in my apartment complex always look adorable and put-together, although their look is a good deal more conservative than mine. I wish I could find a happy medium for clothing choices. 

Does anybody know of any good stores or websites that might have more conservative clothing, that doesn't look like it came off a compound somewhere? I like my skirts to be knee-length when I sit, shirts to have a sleeve and not show cleavage. I carry most of my weight in my midsection, so layering shirts always makes me look super bulky. I have a hard time finding clothes that fit this criteria, but I live in a super small town so not many choices outside of the web. 

Any ideas?

We've been fortunate to take advantage of a very fulfilling and cooperative relationship between /r/malefashionadvice and /r/femalefashionadvice; it's honestly *quite rare* to have fashion forums adequately deal with men's fashion and women's fashion, so for both subreddits to exist in the overall Reddit fashion sphere and communicate with each other gives rise to some very interesting dialogue.

**Please come in and share thoughts on gender and fashion**. I've noted some particular questions of interest below, but feel free to start a discussion in another area that is interesting to you! *(Note: this discussion has been cross-posted to MFA. It'll be cool to get input from both sides. :3)*

***

**How does society present fashion differently for men and women?** I think many MFAers are familiar with the old chestnut that women *intrinsically* know more about fashion and style. But from the FFA side, I know many of us are also aware of the undue pressure that women's media places on fashion. A ton of women-oriented lifestyle mags will have fashion features (*interior design magazines* will even infrequently feature fashion and style reportage!), and I think there's a general perception that the Prototypical Competent Woman of this day and age is informed about fashion, has developed a unique personal style, and has a standard of fashion awareness and taste that many women feel trapped by.

**How does the culture differ around men's fashion and women's fashion?**

I've addressed this somewhat above; would like to add the question of how men approach shopping versus how women approach shopping. My impression is that women's fashion culture is strongly influenced by the fact that *shopping is a social pastime*, and going to the mall with friends and shopping frequently is seen as a normal move even if you aren't really ""into"" fashion. I think this has large ramifications on how menswear and womenswear treat the issues of disposability, fast fashion, quality of construction, longevity…

Another point of interest in this discussion—use of male models in womenswear, or female models in menswear; [trans models](http://transgriot.blogspot.com/2012/12/the-long-stylish-line-of-trans-models.html) (the link is quite interesting as it brings up models from decades ago!), and what it means for fashion houses to explore gender boundaries not just aesthetically but through casting and ad campaign decisions.

**How is fashion a method to enforce gender norms and identity?** It's so interesting to see how MFA advice posts will often say ""I have childbearing hips"" in an apologetic way—*in clothes I exhibit what seems a more feminine shape and I am escaping this*. We've had discussions on FFA about using the term ""boyish"" to describe figure, and often talk about the introduction of masculine tropes/styles in womenswear. There are quite a few popular WAYWT posters who go for a deliberately androgynous or borrowed-from-the-boys look.

So what does that change about men's fashion culture given that more people are assumed to be new to it? Isn't it unfair that we expect women to be intrinsically more informed? How do the standards on what women know about fashion help or hinder us? 

It's interesting how the borrowing is very one-way—I personally don't know of many situations where womenswear tropes were borrowed effectively and with popular adoption in menswear. Does anyone else know? Thoughts on this dynamic?

**How is fashion a method to subvert or transcend gender norms and identity?** Obviously, for womenswear there's been great success in borrowing motifs and patterns from menswear (e.g. [YSL's Le Smoking](http://www.vogue.com/voguepedia/Le_Smoking), a women's jacket modeled after a traditional men's tux). It's very interesting to trace parallels between the early women's rights movement and the increasing adoption of androgyny or even overt masculinity.",[Discussion],False,self,t5_2s8o5,1374257151.0,discuss,,True,t3_1in6ci,http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1in6ci/fashion_genderlets_discuss_how_fashion_is/,

I was planning on responding to these on Friday and then was hit with a work emergency. I've also realized a separate thread may be useful because I felt that I had additional questions for the community at large.

I am happy to build a quality wardrobe with sale items, thrift store items, and with ebay searching. When I buy new and pay $150, I have a (perhaps misguided) belief that I should be able buy a dress, a pair of jeans, or a sweater that will last 5-10 years. 

This belief is based on the fact that I am currently weeding out my H&amp;M and Forever 21 items purchased in 2005-2009 from my closet, not because they've fallen apart, but because they're dated. My logic is that, if I can keep these things looking decent for 4-8 years, I can certainly work with a $150 item to make it last just as long or longer. I certainly have a pair of Joe's jeans that I purchased in 2009 for $120 that still look brand spanking new, and I feel comfortable continuing to purchase from that brand in the future with the belief that those items will last forever if I'm careful.

So my question is, now that I'm set on jeans,  where is the middle ground between the $30 dresses and the $300+ dresses? Where does one shop, aside from sales or thrift stores, when they are done with fast fashion but are unable to purchase designer pieces? Is anyone else in this ""zone"" with me?

For instance, I've been searching for 2 years for the perfect little black dress at thrift stores and am ready to pull the trigger on buying one at the $150 or lower price point. If I had to buy new and not rely on a sale, which brands would I be looking at? What brands/stores can I expect to have sales that will put decent items at the $150 price point? Am I crazy for expecting a $150 item to last 5-10 years with hand washing and careful care?

Am I only looking at, say, J Crew, Banana Republic, and Ann Taylor? Are these really fast fashion stores? Are there other individual brands/online outlets (maybe like Everlane, which I plan to join today) at this price point?",[Discussion],False,self,t5_2s8o5,False,discuss,,True,t3_189plz,http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/189plz/where_is_the_middle_ground_between_fast_fashion/,

1361468162.0,102,self.femalefashionadvice,18yq49,A Short Guide to Selling Secondhand [USA bias],nothingsong,115,13,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/18yq49/a_short_guide_to_selling_secondhand_usa_bias/,"So you've outgrown your J. Crew chambray, bubble-hem skirts and studded Lita knockoffs.  Now what?  Fortunately for you, there’s a big market out there for secondhand clothing.  Stores that buy and sell secondhand will run the gamut from cheap and trendy to expensive, designer consignment.  Here’s a brief guide to determine when, where, and how to get rid of your used clothing.

** *


**What can I sell?** Apparel, handbags, and shoes are the most common items to resell, though accessories like scarves and jewelry can often be sold as well.  Policies will vary from store to store – some stores only accept certain brands, while others will consider anything.  Call the store before you bring your items in to check what brands they accept.

**When should I sell?** Stores will be much more likely to buy items that are seasonally appropriate.  Consignment shops have limited space and will often turn down items that can’t be sold in the coming months – so don’t try and sell your shorts in December or your wool coat in May.  Early autumn (August/September) and early spring (March/April) are great times to start clearing out items for the coming season.  Trendier items should be sold while they’re still current, but more traditional pieces can be resold years later.

**What condition should my items be in?** Everything should be *clean* and in *good condition*.  Many stores will accept anything from new with tags (NWT) to gently used, though NWT items will fetch a higher price.  It's usually OK to sell clothes that have been professionally tailored, but very few stores will accept torn, damaged, or heavily worn items; unless it’s a designer piece, a damaged item is usually not worth reselling.  A handful of high-end boutiques require all items to be dry cleaned with cleaning tags attached.

**How much will I get?** Unfortunately, not too much.  Resale of most mall/high street brands will only fetch you a couple of dollars per item; many stores will offer store credit or lesser amounts in cash.  Some designer items can fetch near-retail prices (or gain value if the item is particularly rare) when sold individually on eBay, though the process may take much longer.

**Why didn’t they buy any of my stuff?** So you tried a store or two, and nobody was interested in your stuff.  Typically, this is because your items are:

* not in style

* not in season

* not a notable brand

* uncommonly sized or altered, or

* worn or damaged.

Your only options now are to donate what’s left (please do not donate heavily damaged items – this is both disrespectful and a hassle to charities), recycle the items for another purpose, or throw them out.

**Where can I do this?**  There are only a handful of national chain consignment stores –[Buffalo Exchange](http://www.buffaloexchange.com/), [Crossroads Trading Co.](http://crossroadstrading.com/category/consignment/), [Plato's Closet](http://www.platoscloset.com/), and [Second Time Around](http://www.secondtimearound.net) come to mind.  However, there are many small boutiques that vary from city to city.  Your best bet is to Google consignment shops in your city and call around to see what they accept.  Keywords to try:  consignment, resale, vintage, used clothing.   If you can’t find anything in your area, try selling to one of the online shops below.

** *

**Online Consignment Stores** (specialty in parentheses).  This only includes stores that you can sell to online by mailing in your items or mailing them directly to a buyer.

**Where to Donate**

N.B.:  Some charities misrepresent what happens to your donated clothing.  Donated clothing rarely goes to people in need – they are typically resold or recycled by textile manufacturers.  Additionally, some charities are run by organizations with explicit political, religious, or moral views.  If this is a concern, look into the charity’s policies before you buy or sell to them.  If you want your donated clothing to go straight to people in need, call your local religious institution or homeless/VA/women's shelter and see if they are accepting donations.

I see a lot of ladies in or around their 20's posting here for help getting together pieces of a basic wardrobe. This is the age where you begin dressing for some new situations (college, job interviews, friends' weddings, etc) that require a more adult closet of clothes. Here is a starting point for young women on a budget beginning to shape their ""grown up"" wardrobes:

**Tops**   
* [Merona V-Necks.](http://imgur.com/xMQKJ)  $8  I suggest at least one white and one black. These are perfect for casual dates with jeans or bridal showers tucked into a skirt with a sweater.  
* A Good Blouse (or two). Here are a few I like for around $30: [1](http://imgur.com/DmYwv), [2](http://imgur.com/5Gi22), [3](http://imgur.com/8Mn7P), [4](http://imgur.com/3lv6a) *Note*: Bare shoulders should be covered by a sweater in most business settings. When in doubt, cover them up.  
* [Cardigan Sweaters.](http://imgur.com/Fudir)  $30  Every woman should have at least one in white, black, or grey that fits well; not too tight, not too baggy. Don't be afraid to try colorful ones, or experiment with ruffles/prints/beading/size!

**Dresses**  
* For Work. [This.](http://imgur.com/XLbkz) [Or This.](http://imgur.com/XLbkz) Both are $30. When wearing a dress to work think of the high school fingertip rule. Nothing shorter than that is appropriate. Remember that bare shoulders may require a sweater. Also, keep cleavage in mind and to a minimum.  
* For Weddings/Family Brunch/Lunch Meetings. [This.](http://imgur.com/0PoZb) [Or This.](http://imgur.com/ykGoU) Both are $35. Depending on the situation, you can go shorter than for the office. No sweaters needed here. 

**Bottoms**  
* Jeans. Jeans are a very important part of a woman's wardrobe. Most of us do everything in our jeans. I can't tell each woman to wear the same pair of jeans, you have to find the right pair for you. Take time to find your fit. Go shopping by yourself, so you don't have to hide your frustrations when 10 out of 10 pairs don't work. Try a million pairs of jeans on. Even when you think you found a pair, try a few more just in case. Don't be afraid to get a pair tailored. Fit the thighs and have the waist taken in, or get ""longs"" and have them hemmed an inch. Be patient, your perfect pair of jeans is out there. Also, jeans are something you may want to splurge on. Dropping $70-100 on a good pair of quality jeans is a good investment.  
* [Wide Leg Trousers.](http://imgur.com/JaQbD)  $70  Besides jeans, this is the most expensive item on my list. These pants should be a staple for all women, big or small. They are timeless, flattering to all, and professional.   
* Skirts. Similar to jeans in that every woman and every body type needs a different skirt. Keep these things in mind for appropriateness: length and print. Here are a few I like: [1](http://imgur.com/ZzAdb), [2](http://imgur.com/Krp03), and [3](http://imgur.com/20TNp)

**Accessories**  
* [Fake Diamond and Pearl Earrings.](http://imgur.com/5DarZ) You can worry about getting the real thing later. $3  
* A Watch. This can be faked, but it is an accessory you may want to invest in now. [$20](http://imgur.com/vi9UC) [$250](http://imgur.com/alIJP)  
* A Pendant Necklace. [1](http://imgur.com/KzGG1) and [2](http://imgur.com/faaWF)This can break up a dress or skirt outfit in the same way a belt does. 

**Shoes**  
* Flats. A very good staple for any young woman on the go. Some examples: [1](http://imgur.com/hoSjj) [2](http://imgur.com/4ThS6) [3](http://imgur.com/5haOl)  
* Heels. Every woman should have a pair in black and a pair in brown or nude. [Black](http://imgur.com/hJVUE) [Brown](http://imgur.com/iaWo5)  
* Sandals. You're now old enough for a little more than a flip flop. Though those are perfect for many occasion. [1](http://imgur.com/7UkmU) [2](http://imgur.com/tVvlp)

There is so much more to a personal wardrobe than this, but it's enough to get you going. There is tons of room here for your personal style.

This shouldn't need explaining, but apparently it does.

Reasons to downvote someone:

* Trolling
* Being an asshole; having a shitty attitude
* Giving truly inexcusable advice (unflattering to the asker's body type or age)
* Being entirely unhelpful

Reasons *not* to downvote someone

* Because you don't like ""hipster"" fashion (or whatever look is being discussed)
*  Because something is too ""wild"" for you, even if the OP totally loves it
* Because it reminds you of a past decade, and that's ""so out"" (let's face it, it's ""in"" and if someone can rock it, let them)
* Because the OP wants to wear a hemline too short for you


I'd also like to address that it seems like half of FFA thinks we're too critical, while the other half thinks we aren't critical *enough*.  To put it bluntly, most users are simply critical for the wrong reasons.  I think a lot of people give advice based on their personal tastes, instead of paying attention to the trend at hand.  Anyway, that's just how I feel on the matter.  I'm sick of going to threads asking for hipster advice, *giving* hipster advice, and being downvoted because it's ""weird.""

I was wondering if we could do something like [Brands: Caution](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/lnr90/brands_a_cautionary_overview/) like they have at MFA, but less negative.

It would be great to have some kind or repository of sizing notes and what body types brands are good for.

EDIT: updates are below

EDIT: Hey folks, if you disagree with someone, please say why, don't just down vote them. Would like to get as many viewpoints as possible here.

Thanks ladies! Let's keep this going. Would love to hear about ASOS and BlackMilk since those are two places I've been thinking about ordering from at some point.


* **American Apparel** Quality is declining.

* **American Eagle Outfitters** Jeans are good for short girls. Runs almost 2 sizes too large.

* **ASOS** Carries a petite line.

* **Banana Republic** Sized for taller women. Carries small sizes (starting at 00/xxs), carries a petite and tall line, frequent online sales,

* **Charlotte Russe** Inexpensive jeans that are good for pear shapes. Not too long and good rise length and fit both waist and legs. 

* **Express** Good quality jeans. Look for coupons or deals before you buy. Dress shirts and bottoms run large.

* **Forever 21** Extremely uneven in terms of sizing and quality (poorly sewn buttons, etc). Try everything on and be careful!

* **Gap** carries small sizes (starting at 0/xs), carries a petite and tall line, online reviews are extremely helpful in determining item fit/quality, frequent online sales

* **JCrew** Tops are true to size but bottoms run large. Their [sizing chart](http://www.jcrew.com/sizecharts/main.jsp?sizeChart=1,1) before you buy. It's very accurate. Shoes run narrow. Flats are not great quality, but heels and boots hold up. Sweaters pill after one season. Thinsulate coats are very warm and are heavily marked down in January. Carries small sizes (starting at 00/xxs), carries large sizes (up to 20), carries a petite and tall line

* **H&amp;M** Runs small in the bust. They have good stretch basics for cheap, and their office wear section has the occasional gem. The thicker cotton qualities hold up well. Carries small sizes (starting at 0)

* **Levi's** Good for curvy girls

* **Loft** Runs very large. Carries small sizes (starting at 00/xxs), carries a petite and tall line

* **Mara Hoffman** Runs small, go up a size or two

* **Mexx** Decent quality, well suited for taller women (jeans with inseams up to 35""!), classy style suitable for office wear.

* **Mod Cloth** [Age 35 and under] Overpriced for the quality. Similar or same pieces can be found at [LuLu's](http://www.lulus.com), [Ruche](http://shopruche.com/), [Francesca's Collections](http://www.francescascollections.com/) or Forever 21 for cheaper

* **New York and Company** Good quality work separates.

* **Pac Sun** Poor quality. Clothes that are from a 'name' brand, like Volcom, and sold at Pac Sun are lower quality than that label's regular clothes.

* **Paige** Good for women with long legs and slim hips. Conservative detailing (grommets, etc.). Can be worn by 30+

* **Seven** Good for less curvy girls. 

* **TopShop** Overpriced for the quality. Similar or same pieces can be found at H&amp;M

* **Uniqlo** Good quality for the price. Runs small. (Uniqlo 6 is equivalent to a 0-2). Good for long waisted ladies.

* **Urban Outfitters** Quality is uneven so be careful. 'Kimchi Blue' label seems to hold up better than others. online reviews are extremely helpful in determining item fit/quality

* **Zara** Sizing is extremely variable (a person could fit comfortably into M and not be able to wear an XL in another item), but it's cheap and good for more decorative items.

[In response to my post about clothes I got thrifting](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1ca8p6/ive_been_on_a_thrift_store_run_for_the_past/), I decided to write a guide on thrift shopping!

##Before walking out the door:
---
Have a general style in mind. Have an inspo album, take a look at your closet and what you love, etc. [Guide: Finding a Style &amp; Building a Wardrobe](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/vxfhj/guide_finding_a_style_building_a_wardrobe/) is good.

[For fun, this is my inspo album.](http://pinterest.com/rachellee321/clothes/)


## Picking out thrift stores:
---
1.	Maybe this should go without being said, but **aim for stores that are in richer population areas.**

2.	**Make sure your ideals match the thrift store’s ideals too.** Don’t inadvertently support something that you don’t actually support! 

3.	**Consignment and buy back stores are your friends, too.** Yes, the costs will be higher but you’re going to get some stellar quality clothing for a fraction of the cost. Plus, you can sell your old stuff there and get store credit. By buy back stores, I mean places like Plato’s Closet and Uptown Cheapskate.

##Clothing:
---
1.	**Before anything else, make sure you nail down a “brand limit.”** For example, my brand “minimum” is Banana Republic and J Crew. This can be stretched sometimes, but it’s a nice guide to have. *Edit: This is primarily for people who are new to thrift shopping. After a while, you'll get the hang of what feels quality regardless of brand. I have certainly purchased Target, Gap, etc. brand names. The main thing to keep in mind is that a lot of these items have had a previous life, so you're getting it the second time around. You want to make it work for you as long as possible. I would also think of this as a ""brand quality minimum"" as in I won't usually go below the quality of an average J.Crew or BR piece.*
2.	**If you don’t know the brand, feel the quality.** You’ll get the hang of this over time as you aim for higher brand stuff anyways.
3.	**Stick with that inspo album we talked about.** 
4.	**Have some overarching goals in mind.** For example, for a while, I was looking for a brown leather jacket. Instead of just generally browsing the coat section for whatever, I specifically picked out brown leather and pulled it out. 
5.	**Stained, stretched, etc?** Not worth it.
6.	**Too big but awesome? Get it tailored.** Still so much cheaper.
7.	**Pre-tailored items:** Occasionally you’ll find items that are pre-tailored, so if it’s a piece that you were considered getting tailored – make sure you check for that. They may have removed the fabric such [as this dress](http://i.imgur.com/Rzqb6u2.jpg), and therefore it can’t be lengthened, etc.
8.	**Don’t buy:** Things that only fit. If they don’t fit your style, meet your brand minimum, etc. just don’t even try it on. 

##Shoes:
---
1.	**Again, have a brand minimum.** Mine is personally Nine West.
2.	**If they hurt or doesn’t fit, don’t buy it.** You’ll never wear it and end up just redonating it.
3.	**Watch for wear!!** Again, seems obvious but it’s so hard to ignore when it’s just adorable. Look for: lifted insoles, [fraying edges](http://i.imgur.com/PTl3Luf.jpg), visible threading (unless that's the style obviously).
4.	**Try on BOTH shoes in the pair.** It’s really easy to try on one shoe and assume the other will be fine (because that’s what you do when buying new shoes) but I’ve discovered boots with one broken zipper or heels with the tip missing.

##Bags:

---
A little bit easier, but again go for the quality. A lot of the good purses at Goodwill will be under the counter, and can still be surprisingly cheap. I looked at a couple from under the counter today and one was a Fossil tote for $9. Really check the insides of these especially.  Otherwise, go for your style!

##Generic tips:
---
1.	**Your smartphone is your friend.** Use it to look up brands that you’re not sure about but seem like their quality. 
2.	~~**Take pictures of what you try on in the mirror.** Your perception of it in the mirror is one thing, actually looking at the picture is like seeing it from someone else’s perspective.~~ Edit: [Thank God I'm wrong!](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1ccpgo/thrift_shopping_guide_discussion/c9fm9wc)
3.	**Don’t be discouraged!!** Be comfortable with yourself, what you like, and your body. It’s the only way you’ll be a successful thrift shopper. I can tell when things will be too small for me even if it’s marked my size, and you know what? That’s fine. It’s the clothing, not me, that’s wrong.


##A shopping trip at the thrift store for me:
---
*AKA: Why sticking with the above guidelines are important*

I start with the shoes, because shoes are fun and a great way to get me pumped about the rest of the trip. Also, I don’t normally wear heels when I go thrift shopping so it’s nice to have a pair in the dressing room. Then I go to bags as I really never find any that I get. I am rather picky and rarely switch between them, so this is really a quick glance section for me. Now, I get started on the tops. I stick with my inspo album on this, and usually skip red/yellow/orange entirely, do a cursory glance over green &amp; blue (usually if I see a fabric I like sticking out), then really hone in on the prints and neutral colors. I also don’t like wearing dark colors on top, so I skip over dark browns and blacks. I do the same thing with dresses, skirts, and pants. I already have the perfect black dress and a couple pairs of black slacks, so I skip over those sections, etc. It legitimately makes the whole trip so much less overwhelming, because I’m really only focusing on half the store – if that.

##A lot of this seems obvious!

Great! You're probably already a fashionista. Remember, a lot of women on here are still totally new to fashion and are put off by the high prices of most things (like me!). These guidelines are good to have in the back of your head while thrifting so you feel focused, not overwhelmed, etc.

###Biggest thing to take away: If something *doesn't* look good on you when it's $100, it still won't look good on you when it's $3. Don't get fooled by low prices! 

Pleeease ask me any questions, make suggestions, and critique me to hell. Go!

1349716342.0,95,self.femalefashionadvice,1159dm,"I'm a fashion novice with very few clothes. I [25f] lost a lot of weight recently and need much help being fashionable and shopping for my body type. You will seriously have your work cut out for you, FFA.",TheFemaleGaze-,112,17,61,http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1159dm/im_a_fashion_novice_with_very_few_clothes_i_25f/,"Hi everybody. Let me preface this by saying that I am imagining this will be pretty painful (for me) because I've never opened myself up to critique in this arena before. But I am ready now, and I so very much want to be a stylish person. I just need help, badly!! As I explain more further down, I recently lost 70 lbs and can wear many mainstream brands now, which didn't fit me before. I am still in the process of losing weight.

I've embedded helpful(?) photos throughout the post.

**Height**: 5'6
**Weight**: 190
**Age**: 25

**Body type**: I struggled somewhat with this, because I am large, especially in the hip/thigh area. I guess this makes me pear-shaped? I removed the pictures of me in my skivvies so that I may retain my honor :). Most people who saw the pictures described me as either pear-shaped or hour-glass (with more suggesting hour-glass).

**My measurements are as follows**:
Bust: 42.5""
Band: 36""
Waist: 33""--I measured at the ""thinnest"" part of me, but is this my actual waist? It seems very high up. I've always worn my pants very high.
Hip: 43""
Upper thigh area: 46""

**Why? Why are you looking to dress better?** I've always lacked confidence when it came to choosing clothing, mostly due to my weight and not feeling like nice clothes looked ""right"" on me. In high school, I wore (exclusively) movie and band t-shirts with jeans, and never anything nicer. [I recently lost 70 lbs](http://imgur.com/a/J374z), and would love to update my wardrobe with clothing that is stylish and fashionable (and affordable.) Up until a few months ago, I was STILL wearing clothing from when I was 70 lbs heavier... That awful pink shirt from the first ""before"" picture? I was still wearing it--a 2X on a L frame. Now, I have about 5 shirts, all from Kohls, that I wear very often, and I really need some diversity in my wardrobe. I have ONE pair of jeans that fits me, and it's the only type of pants I own. So awful. PLEASE help me.

**You now**: [Here are some photos of my commonly-worn outfits](http://imgur.com/a/3wGC6). And when I say commonly-worn, I mean commonly-worn. I have so few clothes that stuff makes a repeat appearance within a week. My current style is... plain. I have one pair of dark skinny(ish) jeans, which I got from Target. I have 5 tops, all from Kohls, and all of which are embellished with sequins or beading around the neckline, etc. The shoes I wear are are either those white sandals, or a simple pair of black flats. I don't ever really wear skirts or dresses. I am not a fan of my legs, which are chunky, and I'm not sure what length of skirt would be appropriate for me. I never really have an occasion for wearing a dress, ditto heels. I'd like that to change, though! Please don't take this to mean that I'm not open to dresses/heels, because I am!

**You after**: I would like to look modern and put-together. I'm not sure how to describe what style I'm aiming for, really. Not particularly edgy. I enjoy deep colors like purples/maroons and neutrally greens and blues. I like the sort of vintage looks at Target (Merona, I think?) They have lots of the greens/purples/mustard yellows that I like. Historically, I haven't particularly liked ""standing out"" but I am hoping to change that. 

**Budget**: I don't necessarily have a budget, per se, but realistically I wouldn't like to spend more than $50 on any ONE article of clothing, unless it's a special occasion or something like a nice jacket. I haven't set out thinking about how much I'll be buying, but I am not the wealthiest individual (did the fact that I only own 5 tops tip you off to that?). However, I do have a good chunk of disposable income that I can pour into this effort. 

**Haircut**: I would love suggestions on a hairstyle, if at all possible. I have pretty much always worn it medium/long, straight, with a little bit of layering for volume. I have NEVER strayed from this.... but I'd like to try! [Here's a picture of my face](http://i.imgur.com/kqyKj.jpg)... please excuse the lack of makeup and gross morning face.

As the title indicates, the list isn't entirely comprehensive. This is actually based on a similar guide I wrote for MFA, so there are many male brands, and many missing female brands. I gave up on finding some pronunciations, and I'm sure there are better examples out there for others. Feel free to give me feedback, and I'd be happy to enhance the list. If there's great demand, I might include some IPA pronunciation illustrations, but for many of the names this would be quite unexact so for now I've left it out.

Cheers,

    - Nick

Note: The original pronunciation isn't always the best pronunciation for your area or dialect. Let's be honest--forcing a fake French accent will do little more than make you look pedantic (or worse, try-hard). This is just a foundation. Feel free to pronounce your 'N's and don't worry about oral acrobatics. Literally every single person I've ever heard pronounce Maison Martin Margiela pronounces it differently. The point here is just knowing the generally appropriate emphasis, and making sure you're not saying Low-bootin or something embarrassing.",[Guide],False,self,t5_2s8o5,1376242541.0,guide,,True,t3_1k4h3n,http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1k4h3n/an_incomplete_audio_pronunciation_guide/,

Lately, I've been finding that every item I've bought has fallen apart after one wash (and I line-dry everything, and wash low on cold in a brand new washer).  I'm wondering what stores would be good for buying more permanent pieces. 

One big problem I have is that I fit significantly better into ""teen"" sizing - I have tried to shop at places like Ann Taylor, Express, or Gap, but the smallest size is usually too big or doesn't fit correctly.

The idea is to have a weekly thread (similar to how FFA post WAYWT) but it would have a theme that would challenge us to experiment with our wardrobe and explore the limits of our style. The themes could be regarding a situation (like casual outfit for a day at a fair or beach outfits, etc), more precise like colors or a pieces of clothing (earth tones, waist belts, [$20 outfits](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/vg0iu/20_outfits/)), or can be to challenge a common fashion ""rule"" (like wearing black and brown or black and navy together). I don't like the idea of a contest but maybe just posting outfits in the thread to get feedback and to use as inspiration. 

I think the most beneficial part of these threads is that there will be a collection of outfits that fit with a common theme and could easily answer a lot of common questions. This way, if someone wants input on what to wear to a casual wedding, how to wear a hat, or how to wear polka dots, etc, they can search the thread and see a wide variety of outfits. I would be happy to take this up or hand it over to a mod.

I never really thought that much about how tees should look and fit until I started this spreadsheet. I hope at the very least this spreadsheet will be an exercise in thinking about what to look for when buying a basic item.

Even if you may not be fond of the way certain styles may look to you, please be sensitive and realize that other people may have differing opinions from yours. 

Let's start off with some examples. My knowledge isn't incredibly vast, so if I misname something, please be patient with me and tell me what it's called. If there are other styles not listed below that you are interested in talking about, feel free to bring them up.

AND, here's my [timeline](http://i.imgur.com/zM7Ey.jpg) with more pictures of how my body looks.

•	height: 5’7

•	age: 26

•	Bust: 38

•	Underbust:38

•	Stomach: 43 it doesn’t ask for this but I’m going to include that I have a tummy 

•	Waist: 33

•	I have short legs, really super toned short legs and thick calf muscles. 


•	Body Type: I’m definitely a upside-down triangle. I’m a little muscular up on top while my bottom is much much smaller than the top. 


•	Why?: I have absolutely no idea where to start, I spent the first 26 years of my life as a man and I want to finally feel comfortable in my skin. I don’t know what I’m looking for, I guess just any style that fits my body type as everything I tries on makes me look like a man in drag.


•	You Now: Right now my style is super basic, shirts and shorts or jeans. I want to branch out and go for something nicer. And more flattering.  


•	Budget: my budget varies depending on my job but as of recently it’s a little low, maybe 20-30 dollar tops and 40 dollar jeans…I could probably squeeze more out if the outfit is super cute. 


•	Location: yep, I love shopping online, I’m so lazy. And I live in Las Vegas. So I guess it’s more or less a “anything goes” type of city. Also VERY VERY HOT.

A couple more details? 
	Albeit a disgusting detail but I think this will help in helping me is the fact that as much as I try my best not to I sweat. A lot. It’s probably the temperature of the city I live in but regardless cardigans and such make me feel like I’m in an oven.

This is an outfit I picked out using some tips I saw on here and random places as well as just keeping an eye out. I’m not sure how it looks on me. I think it looks good but do you?

Body Type: Most of the time ~~hourglass~~ (I put in the measurements wrong, these make me straight but damn if I don't feel like I have some hips some days. I'll say pear.), but I'm allergic/sensitive to a lot of foods and occasionally end up an amorphous blob. I'm kind of blobbing it out today after giving into peanut butter yesterday. I also have large-ish thighs. 

Why?: I want to make sure that I am getting clothes that go for me and my body style. I'm beginning to eat healthier and lose a little weight but don't really have an end goal in mind at the moment and most days I'm happy with myself.

You Now: I tend to go for flowy/light things with muted colors. I like shoes, even though my album doesn't really show that off unfortunately. I definitely wear heels. I very rarely go for more fitted things due to my pooch and most button ups tend to come apart at the boobs. I do have a few that don't and that I love, but they're boring and I didn't include them in this album. They're my ""I'm in a rush to work today so I know that these look good on me and pants"" back ups.

I missed a few days, and a few days are marred by having to wear work shoes, but I got a good sampling of my style and how I tend to throw things together. I ended up buying a lot of new clothes in the process, so I'm currently on a no-buy until I move some stuff through Poshmark and donate the rest.

Very sorry for subpar photo quality (I live alone and am usually in a rush in the mornings when I do this, hence the mirror selfies), but criticism is still super-welcomed. I got some super helpful advice yesterday in the WAYWT thread, but some users mentioned that this might merit its own thread. Try to be gentle!

[Album of ~30 days of outfits](http://imgur.com/a/hGU5W#0)

About Me:

* **Height**: 5'3""
* **Age:** 25
* **Measurements:** 35"" x 25.75"" x 36"" (bust, waist, hips)
* **Body Type:** Pretty solidly hourglass, albeit a petite one
* **Why?:** I want to look more put together, dress my shape well, and look really well-styled. I'm not trendy, so I'm drawn to classic looks but because of that I want to avoid preppy, boring, sorority-girl, matchy-matchy and so on. Classic but with a bit of an edge. Ladylike but not Modcloth ""quirky."" To give you an idea of my personal style safe zone, see [this pinboard](http://pinterest.com/paonecarlate/my-style/). I really love Audrey Hepburn (not just Holly Golightly), but my go-to street style fav on any given day is Alexa Chung. Charlotte Gainsbourg, her mom Jane Birkin and Brigitte Bardot are also inspiring (though I have a semi-shameful soft spot for Lauren Conrad, too). Brands I love are Kate Spade, Rebecca Minkoff, and Dior though I've only invested a little in them so far.  And for an idea of my discomfort zone, i.e. things I'm drawn to but afraid to try, see [this board](http://pinterest.com/paonecarlate/%E3%81%A0%E3%81%91%E3%81%A9-i-wanna-get-a-new-look/). **If I could boil down into a few words what I'm shooting for, they'd be: gamine, Parisienne, clean, classic, stylish.**
* **You Now:** My current style waffles between boring and sloppy. I want to look classic, but I come off ""safe,"" or I want to try something new but I just get it wrong and look messy. Things I tend to wear a lot are Gap, Madewell and Uniqlo. Before that I was all H&amp;M, F21 and *delias, so my style is evolving. I'm at a point where I'm okay investing more in my clothes. I am girly and don't dislike skirts, high heels or pretty much any article of clothing, but I tend not to wear dresses and skirts to work since most people are super casual in jeans (most people where graphic tees and jeans -- my boss wears crocs every day!). I am not into the hyper-trendy, though, like black &amp; white prison bars I've been seeing on everyone lately for example. This is mainly because I don't know how to style such trends. I want to invest in clothes that I'll wear again and again and feel comfortable in. My job is jeans-friendly so I don't have to dress business casual, but I usually try to dress up a little because I enjoy it.
* **Budget:** Low to mid-range. The highest I'm willing to go for a single article of clothing is maybe $40-$80, for a dress or something more intricate I'll happily invest $100-$300. Pretty much my limit for any one item is $300 at the moment, and usually that's a purse. I rarely splurge on one item, tending to invest a little bit in a few items in the middle range or going on a shopping binge for trends to try at at a low-end retailer like H&amp;M or F21. At the moment I'm trying to edit my warddrobe way down and only go for the essentials.
* **Location:** US, LA (Los Angeles, not Louisiana)! Good weather year-round means my outfits are very flexible and I have lots of access to major retailers. The only thing I don't really need is a lot of outerwear. However, I do travel for work a fair amount and do need clothes for that occasionally, too.

Happy to answer any more questions or post more pictures if needed, but I'm pretty verbose, so hopefully that covers it!

ETA: Guys, thank you so much!!! You're all wonderful and very, very helpful. A few things:

1. The hideous (but comfortable) American Eagle booties are officially retired. They'll be replaced by an ankle boot with a slimmer fit up top. It's clear the look I thought I was doing with those is not coming off as intended or working.
2. Sorry about the ugly sneakers in a couple of the outfits. I work about 5-6 work events a year so I'm torn on whether or not to even bother with dressing up for those things.
3. Oh my god FIT!! I had no idea that the fit of my clothes was even a problem, but it seems SO obvious to me now. I'll study up on fit and look into getting some of these things tailored. What can't be tailored will be replaced by similar pieces from a petite line.
4. Jeans! Ugh. I'll keep looking for better fitting jeans that don't sag in the knee.

It's not the fact that they're gay, it's just that it's at midnight, there's just no description of how formal it is, and there are 70 weddings so there will probably be a variety. Moreover, it's at City Hall, so it's probably not very religious.

1374012531.0,89,self.femalefashionadvice,1ifzs9,10 Step Wardrobe Revamp discussion. (French/Capsule wardrobe),dcs24,106,17,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1ifzs9/10_step_wardrobe_revamp_discussion_frenchcapsule/,"I found [this article](http://into-mind.com/2013/01/06/10-step-wardrobe-revamp/) last week and wanted to share it with everyone. It's a 10 step process to revamping your wardrobe, but by no means do you have to follow all 10 steps. 

The first part of the article talks about a minimalist approach to your wardrobe and what that means. To quote,
&gt;... it is about embracing the minimalist concept of having less but making sure that everything you do have fits your aesthetic taste and lifestyle perfectly.

While I agree with this for the most part, I'm starting to drift from the term minimalism which is sort of this passive way of dealing with *less stuff* instead of being invested (not just financially, but how you care for something, the time you take to seek it out, etc) in your pieces. If you're interested in this idea, here are two articles I love:

1. [The Life Cycle of Gear and Its Impact on Our Lives](http://hackmake.org/2013/07/the-life-cycle-of-gear-and-its-impact-on-our-lives) 
1. [Active Ownership vs. Minimalism](http://hackmake.org/2012/02/active-ownership-vs-minimalism).

Now, getting back to the wardrobe article...

The second part talks about essentially purging your wardrobe. I don't agree with all the different steps and having different piles for different feelings (throw away, donate, sell, maybe sell, etc). I believe in the hard fast rule ""Did I wear this last season? ""No? Donate it."" and it's over. However, I'll assume most people have a much harder time getting rid of their pieces. I suspect this is a trend in someone's overall life and not just with clothing. For this, I'd recommend taking all those pieces you're unsure about, boxing them up, stuffing them in your basement and in a year go back down there. If you haven't been down there within the year, donate all of it. 

The next couple parts talking about defining your style, creating a uniform and making sure the style fits your lifestyle. I think a lot of people have trouble with defining a style they want to replicate and then creating a visual representation of that style. While I struggle with this, I've started to open up a bit to the idea that my style does not have to be a photo from a style blog I read every day. It's ok to mix things up, which is why **we buy pieces, not outfits.** Buying pieces allows you to mix and match, buying outfits confines you to that one style. I've started to use pinterest to help me build out, visually, what it is I want to represent.

So, we've done the upfront work. Now it's time to actually build a capsule/french wardrobe. I haven't gotten to this point yet, though. This article says to aim for 20-30 pieces, but I don't know if I go for this define a number thing. I rather buy the least amount of *stuff* that I need to create a great wardrobe and not have to worry if I went over the hard fast number of how many pieces I'm allowed in my wardrobe for it to qualify as a capsule/french wardrobe.

In the article, a female CFO is quoted as saying
 &gt;I had to earn the right to wear red,

suggesting that she had to prove her worth while wearing black, navy, and other neutrals before she could wear more feminine clothing at work. 

I also found the contrast between men who wear pink and women who wear pink interesting - for men, it is perceived as a show of confidence; for women, a reminder of their gender - not always seen as an asset in many fields (finance, tech, and other industries that may have a gender gap).

My background: I'm a 20-something white woman who works in government in a relatively conservative (in terms of dress) US city. My office is dominated by men who wear slacks or khakis and button-ups or polos (on casual Fridays). I often wear heels, dresses, and pencil skirts, and am aware that my femininity is emphasized by my style of dress. I have never perceived this as a factor that could be holding me back in my career, but that's still in its nascent stages.

Do you consciously dress in a less traditionally feminine manner for work? What about your female superiors - have you noticed bolder fashion choices or, conversely, stricter adherence to the idea of a neutral uniform?",[Discussion],False,self,t5_2s8o5,False,discuss,,True,t3_1h08gz,http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1h08gz/do_women_have_to_earn_the_right_to_dress/,

Please read our policies below before posting, our check out our brand-new [wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/wiki/index) for a more complete set of FAQs, community expectations, and more.

**Before you post**

##Is your post spam?

For the purposes of this subreddit, spam is anything that we deem to be made purely with the intent to generate traffic to another website or abuse FFA’s structure to promote a website or a blog. Our spam policy is zero-tolerance - spammers will be banned immediately. If you believe you have been banned wrongly, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ffemalefashionadvice) - note, however, that this does not guarantee or even imply a reversal of a ban.

The following things are considered spam or suggest to us that a user may be spamming FFA. Please report any of the following: 

* Affiliate links (a link that is tied back to you such that you will profit from users clicking that link or buying something from it)
* Users without histories of legitimate comments (on Reddit in general or in FFA) beginning to push one website or company
* Users with usernames that consist of/include a website or company name (use your best judgment here)

If there is a website, service, product, blog, etc., you are legitimately excited about and want to share with FFA, please feel free to do so. However, if you are employed by the company or it is your own blog, please make that clear in your post and message the moderators for approval prior to doing so. This is to ensure that FFA is not exploited for website traffic or monetary gain, and that the subreddit is not overrun with unrelated spam. This is one of many reasons we are self-post only - you may find further clarification of that policy [here](http://redd.it/18qd4v).

##Is your post in the right place?

There are many subreddits related to clothing and personal appearance. Here is an incomplete list, along with their purposes:

* /r/findfashion - If your question is, ""please help me find this article of clothing (in my size, for cheaper, in my country)"" or similar, please use this subreddit.
* /r/frugalfemalefashion - Posts about sales, coupons, or other deals belong here.
* /r/wardrobepurge - Trying to sell or buy clothing? Check out Wardrobe Purge!
* /r/makeupaddiction, /r/fancyfollicles, /r/skincareaddiction - for makeup, hair, and skincare advice, respectively. Alternatively, check out our recurring Hair, Makeup, Skincare, Fitness and Fragrance Thread.

##Is your post better suited to one of our recurring threads?

FFA has a series of weekly recurring threads that consolidate some of our most common concerns. These are generally posted around 12:30 PM EST. Our most up-to-date schedule of threads can be found in the sidebar.

If the moderation team feels that your post is better suited to one of the recurring threads, your post will be removed and you will be asked to instead post in a more appropriate venue. If something is truly time-sensitive, exceptions may be made.

## Is your post just a search away?

Before you make a post, use Reddit's search feature. Try different keywords related to your query and read through those. You'd be surprised at what's come up before!

You can also use Google. If you're looking to identify a specific article of clothing, try Google reverse image search or using keywords related to the brand, color, fabric, pattern, etc., of the article in question (if that fails, remember to use /r/findfashion). 

If you're looking for a general article (i.e., a black leather jacket instead of a specific black leather jacket), use a style aggregator. Sites like [Shopstyle](http://www.shopstyle.com/) and [Polyvore](http://www.polyvore.com/) allow you to input search terms (from the very general to the very specific) and sort within a price range to help you find what you're looking for. If it's shoes you're after, try [Zappos](http://www.zappos.com/) - they have an impressive range of search attributes to help you find shoes, even for the difficult-to-fit customer (wide or narrow calfs, short or long legs, wide or narrow feet).

Make sure you've taken advantage of all of these resources before making a separate post asking for help finding an item.

## Have you checked out the sidebar?

FFA's sidebar contains some of our most valuable bits of wisdom - [guides](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/search?q=flair%3Aguide&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on) on everything from [fit](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1jfgz8/a_practicalvisual_guide_to_fit/), [body type](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1dbji7/body_type/), [selling your garments secondhand](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/18yq49/a_short_guide_to_selling_secondhand_usa_bias/), [how to dress for a wedding](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/xnbb8/wedding_guest_guide/) and [how to find a bra that fits](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/16qn7h/hello_ffa_im_a_bit_new_to_this_sub_but_i_noticed/) (also check out /r/ABraThatFits for advice on how a bra *should* fit). There are also links to our resources, such as lists of [FFA Reviews](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/17le0m/ffa_reviews_master_list/) and a link to the [FFA Blogroll](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/xgd8n/ffa_blogroll_v1/).

I may be moving to a place that is below 30F/2C for five months out of the year. When I dress for cold, I look like Dick Cheney in [this picture](http://i.imgur.com/zifbv.jpg). It's only since I married someone from southern England and visited for Christmas that I realized there are specific boots you wear with dresses/skirts when it's too cold for ballet flats and bare skin. Google taught me how to tie a scarf. I'm *that* clueless. 

Here are some more specific questions: 
 
* I have several pairs of trousers/jeans, but when it gets really cold the wind blows right through them. Should I be wearing long underwear  underneath them or just buy thicker trousers? Where do you get thicker trousers/long underwear? 

* How do you wear knee-length skirts in cold weather? Do industrial-strength cold weather stockings exist?

* What are the qualities of a good pair of boots that go with skirts? 

* What is the warmest coat you can buy that doesn't make you look like you're going on an expedition to the North Pole? 

* Earmuffs or hats? My ears get cold very, very easily. 

* Is it just me, or do sweaters in nice clothes stores always seem a bit thin? Is there a place where one can buy sweaters that are dense but not frumpy (see comment about coats and Arctic expeditions)?

* How many scarfs should I get and what kind (color, fabric)?

* I guess you can call me a ""young professional"" so I'm frugal but not cheap. I tend to buy clothes that can go back and forth between causal and work situations. I'm currently wearing skinny black slacks and a black cardigan over blue shirt with a subtle floral pint and matching blue moccasins. I'm partial to Zara and Uniqlo. I'm also currently located in a (warm) place with an abundance of affordable tailors, so having something basic but necessary made isn't out of the question.

**Weight**: 95 lbs

**Age**: 20

**Body type**: Rectangle. I don't have a measuring tape but that seems about right. Bra size is 32A and I wear a size 0 jean. Essentially I'm just very small all around

**Why?**: I'm short, skinny and have a baby face, combine that with my current wardrobe and people are always assuming I'm 14/15, 16 if I'm lucky. With summer coming up I'm in desperate need for a make over. I have an internship in HR so I need to start looking more professional. Also, I'll be graduating by the end of the year so I need to start looking more like an adult and less like a middle schooler addicted to her converse. 

**You now**: [Here I've made this convenient little album!](http://imgur.com/a/NkftB)

I don't typically wear dresses, but recently I've started to wear them more when the occasion calls for it. I still absolutely stay away from skirts, and things with too much frills or with jewels or bows are definitely not for me. 

**Budget**: Think poor college student whose just returned from 3 months abroad. So *really* not a lot of money haha

**Location**: Arizona

The funny thing is I actually really like dressing for winter. I love all the jackets and boots and scarves and what not but when it comes to summer I'm just at a complete loss. Summers in Arizona get brutal, I'm talking 100+ degrees, so I go immediately to the shorts and short sleeve t shirts and flip flops. The problem is I end up looking waaaaay younger as a result ( Just last weekend I literally had a guy at Costco tell me  I needed my parent's permission  before  I could take a sample  
-__-). So I guess not only do I need an office look but I also need to learn how to dress like an adult for the summer. In addition, everything in the stores right now seems to be oversized which doesn't really work with my bust size and just ends up making me look more boyish.

However, with looking around a bit here on FFA and talking to a few of my female friends, it seems as if black is used much more extensively in women's fashion, and I've always wondered why there's been this difference.

AND MAY THE R/FFA GOD(DESSES) HAVE MERCY ON MY NAIVE SOUL

Okay, now that i've atoned for my horrible horrible sin (I am proud to say that i've never stooped to wearing sheer tights in public), I need your help.

I just turned 18 earlier this month, small town girl heading off to the big city for college this fall, blah blah I'm sure you've heard it before. I have a lot of problems with my wardrobe - or lack thereof - and hopefully? you can help guide me to fashion greatness before I get ridiculed in the real world for my terrible fashion choices.

Basically, I have been a slob all my life. I roll out of my bed in the morning, browse through my closet, and settle for either the same skirt or pair of black leggings, and one of like 5 pullover sweaters. Cardigan? Blazer? Boots? Non-black tights? I don't own any of those.

And I want to. But it's scary and overwhelming to jump in and I already get ridiculed for it (both jokingly and non-jokingly) by my friends for ""not wearing pants"" and wearing the same thing over and over again. (i'm kinda poor, okay?) It makes me not want to try something new because i'm scared that it's so different from what I normally wear. I know that life ain't about pleasing others (this is a hard thing to accept, as a natural people-pleaser), but I am a much happier person if I feel like I look fabulous, and that's something everyone should feel all the time (except when shark week rolls in).

But now that I've got a little bit of cash (from working), and i'm starting a new chapter of my life, I want to get away from leggings and sweater sa-yu-ri and move towards, say, cardigan and dress sa-yu-ri or in general more sophisticated-looking. 
Like, instead of having one part of my outfit that stands out, I want to have the whole thing look put-together or whatever. Maybe I can find pictures of what i'm going for. I like my overall 'cute' look, but again, I'm an adult now and I'm pretty sure I can't get away with too many Hello Kitty-esque articles of clothing. 

Okay, orders of business, let's do this:

1. I own a pair of jeggings that I bought from AE on sale, but they dyed my legs blue the first time I wore them. Now they're in a pile on my closet. How can I rehabilitate these poor things so I can wear them? As disappointed as I was that my legs were blue for days, they were pretty damn comfy. I've heard that hand-washing repeatedly in water helps to stop the bleeding. Is there anything else I can do for them?
2. Back to the AE jeggings. The ones I bought are size 0 regular, skinny I guess. I also tried on a pair of 00 short while I was there. Not only did I feel like I was being strangled, the jeans were also hilariously too long on me (like, almost covering my feet, it was fucking absurd). I suspect that I stretched the hell out of them, but another pair did the same thing. I find it unlikely that both pairs were stretched out that much. But the 0 REGULAR were just the perfect length. How is this possible? (Is there fashion jargon for this that explains it?)
3. Except for the jeggings, I haven't worn jeans in over a year. Yeah, i've been keeping track. I'm sorry. I know. It's bad. It really is. I mostly wear skirts (with both sweaters and tops) and dresses, but I've burned through most of my creative combinations (and I have some *good* ones) and it's too cold to wear most of my dresses. Did I mention that I live just northwest of Boston? And I walk 1.5 miles, uphill, both ways, through a Nor'easter to get to school every day? (I actually only walk one way, but you get it.) My goal is to not freeze my ass off for approximately six months, but I can't bear to wear leggings anymore every day or jeans/jeggings every day. Please help. Is it bad to wear tights of varying colors every day for six months?
4. ...but I sweat a lot. It's gross. I admit it. But walking home from school is especially bad, because my feet sweat and it destroys my pretty flat-socks and the shoes themselves, never mind whatever horrible precipitation decides to rain down on my town on a given day. I'll be doing plenty of walking in college (a block separates my res hall and the academic buildings, plus it's Boston), so this isn't going to change. Until I figure something out, i've sworn off flats. They're cute, but even a few days of wears and it seems that i've doomed them to all hell. What am I doing wrong? Also, stains on shirts: do they come out?

5. Hey, so you know those cute leather boots that like every girl is wearing? And those booties? Yeah, I want to own some. I love the beautiful sidebar on women's shoes and boots, but what are some boots that you ladies love? Please keep in mind that I'm a (soon-to-be) poor college student who is fashiontarded and a size 6.5. I know that I should try to invest in quality things that last longer, but since I'm still trying to figure out my style, I don't want to waste too much money.
6. Where do y'all get essentials, particularly v-neck t-shirts? What other 'essentials' should I own?
7. I'm almost done, I swear. I know it's bad, r/FFA, but I like F21. I know they're ""fast fashion"" and I'm not really into that, but I love their Love21/Essentials line. It's more down-to-earth and they have things like simple cardigans. Is that a good place to start for cardigans and blazers and whatnot?
8. I've looked everywhere and I can't find bandeaus. Seriously, these damn things keep evading me. Where do you ladies get yours?
9. Besides flats, sandals, boots, and evening shoes, what footwear must every female own?

Also, if I could have any one article of clothing right now, it would be [this](http://www.lulus.com/products/chills-and-frills-peach-lace-dress/81354.html#tab-description) dress. Well, it's what randomly popped into my head while I was casually browsing. It's very me-ish.

Okay, I think i've tortured you enough. Seriously, if you made it this far you deserve many nice things. But I just want to let you all know that I am approximately like 5 tiers below the fabulousness and the 'caring' level that most of you fine people are. I don't aspire to be completely fashion-savvy or anything, just to feel like I'm not an ugly duckling that dresses like an elementary schooler. It's not as cute as it was 3 years ago, even though I could pass for 15 very easily.

I'll see if I can get pictures of myself wearing some of my favorite things, but I don't have a floor length mirror. I'll try, though.

tl;dr: I want to dress more stylishly, also tell me about boots and jeans.

Here are some of mine:

If I'm showing skin on top, its best for me to minimize how much skin I show on the bottom and visa versa.

If I'm wearing tight pants, its best not to wear a super tight shirt, and visa versa.

If I'm going to blowdry my hair, leave my makeup minimal and simple, and if I'm going to let it dry naturally (resulting in a loose and wavy jew fro) I can be a bit more dramatic with my makeup.

In my city, Tims have been in style for as long as I can remember -- they're one of the few items I can think of that completely transcend race and gender. 

Some history:  the Timberland brand dates back to the 1970s when a Massachusetts company developed new technology to produce waterproof boots.  (One of the strategies used to test the boots' waterproofing was to leave it in a factory toilet overnight.)  The iconic style, known as the ""classic boot,"" dates back to the mid-1970s and has stayed more or less the same throughout the years:  6"", wheat color, and even the same SKU (10061, in case you were wondering).  The company markets itself as being socially and environmentally responsible, and is known for sponsoring service trips and programs such as City Year.

While Tims were and still are primarily work boots, the brand has expanded somewhat throughout the years with custom designs and collaborations (such as [this one from Mark McNairy](http://i.imgur.com/eAUQICG.jpg)).

In this album, I wanted to show that they have a broad range in womens' styles:

* Curled hair


I always wear foundation and mascara, but it just doesn't seem to carry that same ""fresh face"" feeling it once did. I've never worn much makeup and wearing blush, eyeshadow and eyeliner helps me feel more put together.

Heels - I've noticed some women look more put together if they have on hells. Unfortuantely I hate them, I don't have many and I can't walk in them - but I am willing to try.

But not just any dress!



**Wedding details:**
She will be getting married at the **circus**, riding in on an elephant! She is marrying a man who is a Shriner, and performs as a circus clown when the circus comes to our town every year. He will be wearing his clown costume, which is mostly royal blue with some black and white. My brother and soon-to-be stepbrother will be wearing black dress slacks and probably royal blue dress shirts. 



**Background information:**
My mom is ~48, 5'7"", wears about a 12 or 14. She has short dark blonde hair and big bright blue eyes. She only shops at thrift stores, is very frugal, doesn't ever do nice things for herself (too busy doing them for everyone else). I really want to help her find a dress that she can look and feel fabulous in. And we need to find it quickly. I'm thinking $200 budget, but could be persuaded to go a bit higher for the right dress. 



**The dress should be:** 

* flattering to her pear shaped figure

* Full length, or possibly mid (age appropriate)

* Bright! Royal blue, red are some colors that come to mind. She's riding in on an elephant for Pete's sake! :D

* From a reputable online retailer that can ship quickly *or* from one of the following B&amp;M stores: Macy's, Boston Store, JC Penney, Sears, Express(though I'm guessing nothing age appropriate there), J Crew (probably not fancy/flashy enough), Cache.



I'm looking for specific dress suggestions and/or websites that may have the kind of dresses I am looking for.

My boyfriend and I are getting married in a few weeks in Gretna Green...we're doing a VERY no-frills, registry office affair, but I still feel like it's an excuse to get a new dress. I don't want to do anything in bridal white, but I was thinking something white-adjacent would work (if that makes sense!). Blush or gold, maybe? It's an afternoon registry office ceremony though, so nothing too Vegasy.

I'm tall with an hourglass figure (40-29-40) and have copper coloured hair and fair skin. I live in the UK and (due to the imminent nature of the event) need to find something that I can get quickly (so UK-based is preferred). My tastes tend toward classic 1950s/60s styles...red lipstick and pearls are daily staples.

Any suggestions at ALL are appreciated...even just shops to look at!

EDIT: Thank you all for your lovely suggestions (and good wishes!)...I'm digging through them and getting ideas, and will probably brave Oxford Street this afternoon when I get off work to go try some things on and see what I fancy, and then do some noodling in my neighborhood at the weekend (and London is the answer to the ""where in the UK are you"" question :-)). 

As to price range, I'd like to keep it under £200. And after having a chat with my mom, I think I might go towards more non-traditional colours (she's advocating blue or green to suit my hair...she got married at city hall in a bright rose-coloured silk dress, so there you go). In the future, I want to do a ceremony in my home town and might go a bit more properly bridal then. We shall see what the future brings!

Thanks so much! :-D

Let me preface this wardrobe with some quick facts about myself.

1. I'm 19 years old, about to be a junior in college, but am currently interning at a Fortune 50 company in an eCommerce office, where it is jeans casual and super relaxed. However, during the school year, I do consulting where most of our clients are Fortune 500 and business professional to business casual is required.

2. I'm 5'2, 110 pounds, wear 34B and am a pear shape, meaning that my hips and legs are where my fat is stored, but I'm relatively slim elsewhere. Forgive me if this seems as though it's focused on one body type-- I've tried to include examples of others as well!

3. Budget&amp;Style wise, I shop at H&amp;M, Forever21, Nordstrom Rack a lot. But whenever I buy anything from these shops, I am thorough with checking the construction of the garment, as well as the material it is made out of before buying it. I'm a college student, so everything is budget constrained.

I'll try and go through all the basics a young professional should own.

*Let me also say one important thing: before you go out and shop, you look at your body with a non-critical eye and pick out the things that you like best about yourself. Keep this in mind as you dress yourself and go shopping and pick out clothing that showcases these parts! *
___________________________________________



&gt;**Business Professional
**

**Jacket**

I find myself in a suit often, whether I'm presenting deliverables or interviewing for my next internship. I only have it in black, but a dark grey would work as well, if you wanted to wear it for other occasions. I also looked for a good weight to the fabric. As a pear shape, I also make sure my jacket ends before the widest part of my hips start. Otherwise, I find that my hips are emphasized and I look fat.

I also make sure that the fit is right, meaning that the arms are not too long. The arms should cover your wrist bone, but not extend down your palms or more. The shoulder seam should lay right next to the little bump, toward your arm, not your neck. It should not lay on or inside, otherwise it won't fit right. I'm not sure if everyone has this bump on their shoulder, but I just checked my sister and she does.

[This](http://bim.shopstyle.com/pim/56/32/5632b7a9368adf74eefda09f7bbc8201_best.jpg) is the exact suit jacket that I have from [Express](http://goo.gl/QHBA5) in black. I button it when I'm standing, and unbutton it when sitting down.

For more well endowed girls, you would probably benefit from a jacket that is a 2 or 3 button jacket, such as[ this](http://goo.gl/X9UwK) one. The problem with this example, is that the lapels might be a little bit too wide. Look for a jacket with narrow ones, as well as ones WITHOUT pockets on the top half. Simple pockets for the bottom half are okay. *--Thanks Jamanduh!*


**Trousers**

I have two pairs of trousers that I wear, but only one that I pair with the suit for a business professional outfit. I have [this in black and a dark brown](http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/img-thing?.out=jpg&amp;size=l&amp;tid=51371615) which I got again from [Express](http://goo.gl/xYmrZ).

When trying these on, I make sure that they are not too tight in the crotch. If the fabric wrinkles or puckers when you're standing up, then they don't fit right. They should fit perfectly on your waist and not require a belt. This gives me the most trouble, since my hips are bigger than my waist, so I'd advise going to a tailor to get anything fixed. As for the length, this wholly depends on whether you prefer to wear flats or heels to work. Regardless, your pants should not be long enough where you'd start to step on them. They should not touch the ground, or be close to touching the ground. They also should [not drape](http://us.123rf.com/400wm/400/400/nruboc/nruboc0611/nruboc061100010/603454-a-woman-carrying-an-umbrella-going-to-work.jpg) over the top of your shoe, because you want clean lines. Refer to the picture of the pants above.

Whenever I go out to buy trousers and try them on, I make sure to wear shoes I would wear to work. I also sit down in the dressing room with the pants on to see if they gape in the back. This way, I can also check length based on what shoes I plan to wear often.


**Skirt**

For hot days, or for when I want a different look, I pair the suit jacket with a pencil skirt. As always, when shopping, I look for fabric weight and content. For skirts, I check to see if it is lined, just due to personal preference of not wearing slips. The skirt I have is high waisted, but again, this is due to personal preference.

Fit-wise, I don't want a skirt that is too tight to my body. The fabric should not pucker when standing up. Sitting down should be comfortable. If you feel like the skirt suddenly gets tight when you sit down, then it does not fit. You should also be able to walk normally in them. If your stride is cut down, then the skirt is too small for you. A pencil skirt should also not hug your legs. It should hug your hips and slightly hug your butt. If it hugs your legs as well, then it's a bandage skirt, not a pencil skirt, and is inappropriate for work. The fabric should hang from your butt.

My skirt ends at the top of my knees. When I sit down, it does not pull up past mid thigh, because that would be much too short. It has a slit in the back that facilitates walking. Your skirt could be longer or have two slits by each leg, or be a dark grey or a dark brown. It could be high waisted or not. What matters is that it fits and flatters.

[This](http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/img-thing?.out=jpg&amp;size=l&amp;tid=9191912) is a skirt similar to the one I have, and it should fit like [this](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/318SXNVuBxL._SY445_.jpg).

Not like [this](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dq4uLVj7DxU/Tp3q9tCaZSI/AAAAAAAAAaQ/B96HuP3cwh8/s640/GG-8.jpg). The weight of this fabric is much too thin, and you can see the outline of the shirt that she has tucked in here.

Or like [this](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Xa1aoSEldMs/TLVNCNyjZcI/AAAAAAAAAH0/sNHKFzA_KAE/s1600/pencil-skirt.jpg). This skirt is too tight and the fabric is puckering.


**Shirt or Blouse**

I say shirt or blouse here because some people cannot wear button up shirts without getting them tailored. It just makes sense financially then, to avoid them all together.

The classic white shirt is button up and made out of a high quality cotton with a decent weight to it. Ideally, it shouldn't be too see through. [This](http://bim.shopstyle.com/pim/7b/53/7b53d10bce9a81d32ee813ae23b8f83d_best.jpg) one from [The Limited](http://goo.gl/5Lb59) fits perfectly, as well as [this](http://goo.gl/QyuZb) one from H&amp;M. The arms hit the top of the hand and should peek a little bit out of your suit coat. The buttons in the chest area should not gape. The fabric should not pucker. It should be fitted throughout your waist. If when you wear it, it does not satisfy these requirements, you either must get it tailored, or not buy it at all.

This is when you should wear a blouse underneath your suit coat. This obviously can vary widely and is up to your personal tastes. It helps to pick something in white, or another lighter color, especially if your coat and trousers are in black. But for business casual, you can wear pretty much any blouse, as long as it fits, is modest, and is flattering. Cleavage should not be shown. I like details on my blouse to be part of its construction, and not in the pattern of the fabric. Personally, I think patterns aren't business professional.

[This](http://resources.shopstyle.com/sim/76/18/76187294483213072c30266166cd2604/express-tees-lace-yoke-ruffle-sleeve-easy-tee.jpg) from [Express](http://goo.gl/ZBYlp) is appropriate under a coat, as well as [this](http://goo.gl/gL1gU), [this](http://goo.gl/9XKQs), [this](http://goo.gl/Y28qb), [this](http://goo.gl/iEgnM), or [this.](http://goo.gl/ZIYJa)

Basically, any blouse will do, as long as **fits, flatters, and is appropriate**.

**Shoes**

Close toed shoes are business professional, however these days, I find that an open toed shoe has also become accepted. However, I was taught that they weren't appropriate for business professional. Shoes should be in a solid color with minimal hardware. Flats or heels, just make sure you can walk comfortably in them. Nothing is more unprofessional than hobbling around on heels that you clearly haven't learned to wear. If you do decide to wear heels, there is a line to be drawn for what is appropriate and what isn't. Obviously, 6 inch platform heels are not appropriate for the workplace. My rule for shoes is this: if I bought it with the idea of going to a party/club in mind, then I shouldn't wear it to work.

I have [this pair](http://a2.zassets.com/images/z/1/3/0/4/1/3/1304139-p-MULTIVIEW.jpg) of low wedges from [Cole Haan](http://goo.gl/4vlw3). Honestly, this was the most expensive thing I've ever bought ever, but it was so worth the price. They are the most comfortable pair of shoes I've ever set foot into, but I've also heard good things from their line of Nike Air bed shoes. If your suit is black, so should your shoes be. If your suit is brown, brown shoes.

I've noticed in a lot of threads recently (and not-so-recently) that FFA is really interested in raw denim. So I thought it'd be fun for us to have an FFA-wide raw denim fit discussion/purchase decision making/fade tracking/care thoughts/etc. There are some FFAers who have already purchased raws, and hopefully they can help us all out. 

##What is raw denim, exactly?

I'm going to give you the explanation as I understand it: denim that has not been washed after it has been dyed/finished. You can check out /r/rawdenim for a better explanation if you want.

Raw denim is typically purchased for the ""sick fadez"" - this is where the whiskering and wear is *desired*, unlike typical FFA advice to get dark and undistressed jeans. This is accomplished by wearing them for a very long period of time without washing the jeans. If you don't want high-contrast fading, you can wash the jeans more frequently so that the dye washes out more evenly.

Also, because raw denim fits into a pretty niche market the denim itself tends to be of higher quality. However, it doesn't mean all raw denim is great, or that washed denim is poor quality.

##What brands are there for me to buy?

Many raw denim manufacturers only produce cuts for men. This can be a hassle, because women tend to have larger hips/butt compared to the waist, and slimmer legs, so the cuts may not be flattering or may simply just not fit well. Here are some brands (most taken from [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/1h2u1o/raws_for_girls/) and [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/comments/1jlzm9/female_looking_for_first_pair/)) that produce women's cuts (not comprehensive!):

## That's great, but where do I buy these?

Well, online is great, but you risk having things not fit and all. Personally, I like trying jeans on first. However, depending on where you are in the world, it can be pretty difficult finding a place where you can try them on. I suggest looking at the brands and figuring out which one you like first, then trying to find a local retailer.

## Didn't you say this was going to be a discussion post?

Yep. Soooo. Discuss! Ask questions, talk about different brands' cuts and fit, etc. I'm pretty new to this too, so there'll be tons of questions that I don't know the answer to - so hopefully more knowledgeable people can jump in.

## Didn't you also say that we'd track fades together?

Yes I did! I'll be posting monthly threads that will be shorter asking everyone to post a picture of how their raws are going and how they've been treating them! If you are early/late to the party, you are still welcome to post, too. :D

* Don't buy in season. Look for winter coats in March, swimsuits in autumn, etc. 

* eBay: if you're willing to put in the time, you can find some great deals. Set up an RSS feed with keywords of what you're looking for, and you won't have to work too hard at it.

* To go along with buying online, go to a mall every once in a while and try on everything you like. Sort out what size suits you best in every store and possibly even write down what articles you'd want. Once there's an online sale you can buy things if you still like them, knowing you won't have to return anything.

* Craigslist: also on the difficult side, but people often sell entire lots of clothing in one size. RSS feed also available here. 

* Etsy: mainly good for handcrafted or vintage clothing. No RSS feed available so you'll have to manually search.

* On the petite side? Try looking in the children's department. More likely than not you'll find something that fits. 

* DIY: Learn how to sew, and suddenly everything is much more wearable. This is best for ladies who have a larger bust and can't find much that fits. This also applies to shoes -- finding a pair secondhand and spray painting them is much easier than you'd think.

* Never buy retail. I usually buy things in this order: Goodwill/thrift, consignment, store sale (with coupons, generally).

* Go to thrift stores in wealthier areas. They probably get better donations. On that note, try to visit during weekday mornings, when there should be fewer people.

* Buying something online? Search for a coupon code first.

* Try not to overwash clothing. Consider what the article's been exposed to, dirt or sweat or what have you.

* Drip-dry clothing. It'll reduce wear and tear on the fibers.

* Pay attention to care instructions on the tag. 

* KEEP THE TAGS ON EVERYTHING until you've worn it, and keep the receipts too.

* Iron/hang clothing that would benefit from it. 

* Absolutely NEED to buy something from a store? Look online for secondhand gift cards.

* If you're wearing heels, keep a spare pair of flats with you in case you need to walk a far distance.

I want to be able to do this in my day-to-day dress, not just for evening wear, which I find really hard.

I'm 21, I work as a web developer in an entirely male team. Everything is casual. I guess my style fits in with 'the boys' who typically wear jeans, t-shirts and converse. 

I don't wear trousers. I have a very disproportionate figure. My hips are incredibly wide whereas my waist and boobs are smaller. I'm pretty fat, which I'm working on, but even though I have lost weight I am still going to have wide hips whatever size I am. Not a fan of jeans as they don't fit me very well at all so I find them quite uncomfortable.

I've attached an album of some full-length pics.

I'm just really trying to figure out how to step out of the casual look. I knit and make a lot of my own clothes which I guess isn't very stylish of me either :P

I've found some things I think I like and wondered if someone could cast their eye over them:
[Bodycon dress with a bit of detail](http://www.newlook.com/shop/womens/dresses/mela-navy-crochet-neck-long-sleeve-bodycon-dress_269203741?icSort=Price+(Low+to+High)) I'm thinking could be worn with a skirt over the top, or I could wear it to work with leggings and casual boots and a simple cardigan (so it's not like I'm wearing a tight mini-dress to work which would be weird)
[I'm in love with these shoes](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/290753645854?var=590076585085&amp;ssPageName=STRK:MEWAX:IT&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1423.l2649) to dress up some casual stuff, without looking like I'm wearing dressy heels.
[Printed blazer](http://www.newlook.com/shop/womens/jackets-and-coats/yumi-black-tiger-print-wrap-blazer_258767701?icSort=Price+(Low+to+High)) with a waist cinching shape to it, to wear with my casual or slightly smarter boots and thick tights and a tube skirt. Kinda casual on the bottom, fitted, smart, but not too overly dressy on top. Could also team up with a mini-skirt and bare legs for a night out where I hope I could pull off 'sexy' whilst still being a bit covered up.

This one will be in stores by September 15th, I believe. I think they really knocked it out of the park with this one, that's just my own opinion. There are several pieces that look similar to actual pieces from previous collections by the designer. 


For example:


[This 3.1 Phillip Lim dress](http://www.polyvore.com/trompe-loeil_sequin_back_dress/thing?id=11709954) and the [Target version](http://www.refinery29.com/2013/08/51541/phillip-lim-target-pics#slide-35)

and of course, the [Pashli satchel](http://www.shopbop.com/pashli-satchel-31-phillip-lim/vp/v=1/1589338194.htm?folderID=2534374302181020&amp;fm=other-shopbysize-viewall&amp;colorId=13203) and [it's Target counterpart](http://www.refinery29.com/2013/08/51541/phillip-lim-target-pics#slide-61) for a fraction of the price.

As expected, the quality of these items will probably not be on par with the actual designer pieces. 

My personal picks that I want to check out include

* [this navy sequined pullover](http://www.refinery29.com/2013/08/51541/phillip-lim-target-pics#slide-20) - very cool collar on this one.

Looking for help with livening up my boring wardrobe.  Here is my info:


**Height**: 5ft 10 (and a half!) or 179cm


**Age**: 34


**Measurements**: 
Bust: 32F (definitely accurate – I love my lingerie)
Waist: 30
Hips: 44
Inside leg: 33


**Body Type**: Pear


**Why?**: 

When I was younger I was a bit of a tomboy and lived in jeans, hiking boots and t-shirts.  My first job involved lots of manual labour and I prioritised sturdiness and functionality, such as heavy duty cargo pants and thick sweaters, none of which were attractive on me but did the job.

Over the years, however, I have progressed to a more office based career.  I have made steps to change my wardrobe slowly but feel like I am still missing something.  I have a lot of basics (jeans, grey work pants, brown work pants, black work pants, cardigans of many colours) but I feel like I’m made up of blocks of colour.  I think I’m missing the part that makes it ‘mine.’  

So I’m looking to find my style, while maintaining professionalism.  I also have just moved in with my boyfriend of one year and would like to keep his eyes focussed on me, if you know what I mean. :p   

I also feel like I’m at that dangerous age where certain clothing is making me look ‘motherly.’  X_X  I do not want to look motherly.  I might be getting older and I know I can’t really pull off ‘cute’ like I used to but I would like to feel sophisticated and attractive.  



**You Now:**

I’ve been watching [polyvore](http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/browse.likes?page=1&amp;uid=5253046) and pinterest for some time, trying to pick out if there are any similarities in the outfits I like.  I like the colour co-ordinated ones and I seem to like skirts a lot.  The vintage pieces appeal to me, as I think flared skirts and dresses are flattering to my hips.  

Dark reds, browns and greens suit my colouring (brown hair, brown eyes) but I also like blues.  I’m really drawn to yellow but I haven’t worn it much.  I guess, any bold colour.  Pastels don’t suit me at all.

Wedges are comfortable.  Super high heels will destroy me but I like the way a heel looks and want to wear more.  I would love a nice red heeled shoe but I can’t seem to find one that doesn’t scream ‘prostitute!’ at me.  (Maybe I’m too conservative?)  I think I need a push to try bolder patterns because I feel conspicuous when I wear them even if I love how they look.



**Features:**  I have a nice collarbone and neck.  My boobs are still adequately defying gravity and I can manage a low cut top if necessary.  I hate my knees. They are fat.



**Budget**: An initial spend of around 500 to 600 euros.  Thereafter I can afford up to 200 euros monthly


**Location**: Netherlands (with regular trips to the UK, so I can also shop there).  Plus any mail-order that ships internationally


**Plan:**  

I made a plan, sort of!  Basically I went through my wardrobe and realised I had a lot of stuff I don’t wear because I didn’t have anything to put it with.  So I got rid of some and made a list of what I would need to complete the ones I kept.  Apart from a cute brown skirt, I think have enough basic and what I really need to focus on are more fun items: patterns and colours, accessories, scarves.  I have no scarves.

Which leads me to shoes....  Just how many pairs of shoes is it acceptable for a girl to have because I reckon I need about 8 more pairs just to finish off the outfits I already have!  But, maybe I am barking up the wrong tree...  Before I spend my cash I’d appreciate any input.  Where do you think I should put my cash?

I have scoured countless stores and websites looking for them and my price range isn't small ($75-300).

My mom has been trying to convince me to buy a pair of [Clark's sandals](http://www.zappos.com/clarks-sennett-harmony-beige-leather?zfcTest=fcl%3A0) and while I can appreciate the craftsmanship and recognize that they're comfortable, I don't think they're appropriate for someone my age and the style I'm going for (the heels are all too chunky/not streamlined and they're too busy to be dressy).

[This](http://www.lordandtaylor.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/en/lord-and-taylor/helena-leather-sandals?gclid=COaXnorpqLcCFUee4AodhTcAbA) is what seems to be the happy medium and what I'm planning to order, but I found it totally by accident and it's the exception to the rule. I also think that it's more ""less uncomfortable"" than ""comfortable.""

Why is this so hard? Is it unreasonable for me to want these things or should I have to suffer in some way if I want to look the way I want to look? This isn't a question of ""cheap shoes sucking"" because this doesn't seem to get much better as the price increases. So here's what I'm wondering, FFA:

1. Is this problem unique to women's shoes or are men's shoes equally uncomfortable? 

2. Is expecting shoes to be comfortable a relatively recent phenomenon or is the lack of cute and comfortable shoes a symptom/result of the quantity over quality/fast fashion culture taking over?

3. Is it just that the market for comfortable shoes is bigger than the market for fashionable ones/people will still buy cute shoes if they aren't comfortable? Are luxury designer shoes comfortable? I've heard Louboutins aren't comfortable, but I don't know if Lanvin flats are any more comfortable than Tory Burch.

4. Do you think that there's any chance that women's shoes are uncomfortable because there's an expectation that women should sacrifice comfort for fashion?

5. Do you think that maybe I just have crazy high arches or weird feet and women's shoes really ARE just fine the way they are?

Idk if this is interesting/important enough to merit a discussion tag or not, but I just want to know if it's just me.

I'm (F) in my mid-fifties and over the last 5 years I've lost 30 lbs (I look and feel FANTASTIC).  

(Stats: 5'9"", 145 lbs, 55 years, top hourglass, I want something more modern, more feminine? Now: sweatshirts and relaxed jeans at home, loose tops and relaxed pants at the office, I have no skirts in my closet and two dresses that are too big now.

Here's my question - what should I NOT wear? 

It's probably my hormones playing with me, but I see what women in their twenties and early thirties are wearing and I think, ""I could wear that.""  I've been concerned with comfort and with being ""appropriate"" for so long but now I think about dressing up more (for me).  And women my own age are, well, as boring as I am. 

My husband is no help (obvious reasons, but God bless him) and my mid-twenties daughter thinks I'm just going through a phase (which I am, but I earned it). 

I think I have a good sense of what I look OK in, so I'm not looking for help there.  I've looked for posts about ""age appropriate"" but all I've found were 'what to wear' and 'how do I dress older.' 

 I suppose here's a better way to ask:  Ladies in your twenties and thirties, what would someone like me wear that would make you go, ""Eewww, she should NOT be in public like that!""

===

Recently I've been spending a good deal of time thinking about what the ""ideal""
wardrobe for a modern careerwoman entering the workplace would look like, so
this evening I broke out my list of bookmarks and went to it![^1]

My inspirations were [Theysekns' Theory
AW12](http://www.vogue.co.uk/fashion/autumn-winter-2012/ready-to-wear/theyskens-theory)
meets [Céline
AW11](http://www.vogue.co.uk/fashion/autumn-winter-2011/ready-to-wear/celine/),
with a dash of Scandinavian Functionalism thrown in for good measure - a
wardrobe characterised by sharp, clean tailoring for the office, outerwear
nigh void of ornamentation, a limited palette of black, white, camel, and
khaki offset by pops of colour in knits and accessories. On the weekends and
evenings a slightly edgier aesthetic marked by more directional cuts, 
playful accessories, and subtle subversions of typical casual wear come to the
fore to create an informal wardrobe with all the intellectual trappings of its
professional sister. 

First Principles 
===

The goal here is to have a solid set of starter items that will let you
make it through a week or two without wearing the same thing twice, enabling you
to worry about your work and all the fun opportunities having a job quite
literally affords you, not the laundry. The office environment I am targeting is
a creative industry where you spend the majority of your time in a non-client
facing capacity but occasionally require more upscale attire for meetings and
conferences; lawyers, bankers, and consultants are best served looking for
more constrained attire than what is featured.

* **Budget**: I aim to keep it at roughly €2.000/£2,000/$2,000, the idea being it is
  enough to allow for higher quality items that will last several years before
  replacement, but not so much that it can't be scrounged together within a few
  months of starting work. 

* **Versatility**: Minimalism entails garments have at least a modicum of
  flexibility in how they are styled and worn. When you only have a few items of
  each type there's no use in only being able to pair them with one or two other
  pieces. 

* **Fit**: Essential. Nothing makes clothing look worse than obviously being
  the wrong size! Don't be afraid to be hypercritical in the dressing room, but
  also know what can be cheaply tailored or sewn at home - for the price of a
  lunch at a streetside café a €50 pair of trousers can be made to look like
  €500 ones. 


Work
===

Starting your career is a daunting prospect and knowing you are ready to
blow your coworkers away with style is an excellent confidence-booster. I have
divided the wardrobe into categories with key considerations when shopping
bulleted, followed by item recommendations. In some cases, alternatives for 
climates and cultures other than the cold, grey north are noted.

##Outerwear
Coats and jackets to shield you from the elements and look great while doing it.

* Jackets are often the most striking piece in an ensemble; their status as the
  outermost garment makes it the first item in an outfit to be noticed. 

* Ensure whatever you buy flatters your figure, with special heed to proportion.
  What looks best on a towering 1.75m Scandinavian and a 1.5m Asian petite is
  very different.

* Note the composition and get a feel for the fabric if possible. A polyester
  lining is fine, an outer not so much.[^compositionnote]

  For those not so enamored with black or in a climate that doesn't call for
  such a heavy jacket, this might strike your fancy. - €125

##Tailoring (Jackets and Blazers)
Tailored jackets and blazers in wool and cotton will be a day-to-day essential.
Heartier fabrics such as wool are generally reserved for the cooler months,
while cotton and jersey will keep you cool (and looking great) through Spring
and Summer.

* If it doesn't fit in the shoulders, it doesn't belong in your closet. Altering 
  this is next to impossible and virtually always more expensive than getting a
  fitting piece in the first place.

* Even if you have a habit of wearing tailored jackets open, make sure it
  doesn't pull or wrinkle when buttoned, especially if Mother Nature has been
  generous to your bosom. 

* If an OtR jacket features surgeon cuffs and the sleeves aren't the correct
  length it's going to be hard to fix. Abstain.

* [Weekday Flores Cropped Black
  Blazer](http://www.weekday.com/womens-wear/mtwtfss-collection/all/jackets/flores-blazer):
  This little black thing would pair excellently with high-waisted trousers for
  those days you want giraffe legs, but is a bit too informal for serious
  meetings...which means it'll serve perfectly for a night out to a nice lounge
  or cocktail bar - €120

* [Weekday Speak Blazer -
  Beige](http://www.weekday.com/womens-wear/mtwtfss-weekday/all/jackets/speak-blazer):
  While it's rare, Northern Europe *does* occasionally experience Spring. This
  ventless blazer will go from weekend to workday and back again and bring some
  relief to a black-dominated wardrobe  - €55

* [COS Oversized
  Blazer](http://www.cosstores.com/Store/Women/Tailoring/Wool-mix_blazer/46883-4561639.1#c-4561642):
  For that picky client, oversized enough to differentiate you, but not so much
  as to be unprofessional. Doubles as outerwear for early autumn - €99 


##Shirting/Blouses
You'll want a few nice button-front shirts for more formal days or want to feel
particularly smart. Between regular tops and blouses you want at least 8-10
shirts; generally you can get away with wearing a proper shirt more than once
before washing.  To fit with the modern look, try for slim collars, hidden
plackets, and avoid breast pockets.

* Buy for the chest and shoulders, tailor for the waist and hips. Adding darts
  is easy, adding fabric is not. 

* 7/8th sleeves should be intentional, not due to buying the wrong size.

* [COS Slim Fit
  Shirt](http://www.cosstores.com/Store/Women/Shirts/Slim_fit_shirt/7088-243959.1#c-3633442):

  be totally fine. Slim fit, OK blend, and a well-done simple design - €49 

* [Weekday Dandy
  Blouse](http://www.weekday.com/womens-wear/mtwtfss-collection/all/blouses/dandy-blouse):
  Slightly oversized linen/silk blend should drape nicely and serve as a less
  structured alternative to the COS Slim fit - €100

  White](http://shop.acnestudios.com/shop/women/blouses-1/worth-oxford-white.html?forceCountry=FR):
  Boyfriend Cut Oxford in a rich cotton. 13th month pay has to go somewhere,

  Blouse](http://www.weekday.com/womens-wear/mtwtfss-weekday/all/blouses/lara-blouse-3):

  €50

  Again, similar to the COS Slim Fit, but in a poplin weave - €50


##Tops
Colour-blocked tees, monochrome turtlenecks, 3/4 sleeves, and prominent seams
will all convince people you're ~~pretentious~~ a creative professional. Slouchy
tees in modal and viscose are so comfortable you'll feel like you never took off
your pajamas, and can be worn casually with denim or tucked into trousers.

* [Cheap Monday Cassandra Top - Dark

  Slightly different hem and a wider neck for some variation - €35

* Generally anything in the vein of those three, regardless of colour, should be
  fine. You should be able to find these cheaply with some prudent sale
  shopping.

##Knitwear
Finally, the opportunity to add some colour! Knits are a great way to add
variety to your attire via layering. 

---

* [Zara Backzip Striped
  Sweater](http://www.zara.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/product/fr/en/zara-W2012/269190/870528/STRIPED%20SWEATER%20WITH%20BACK%20ZIP):

* [COS Contrast Knit
  Top](http://www.cosstores.com/Store/Women/Knitwear/Contrast_cuff_knit_top/46889-1015929.1#c-2484532):
  Similar to the flared top, but with blocked sleeves. Avoid having both,
  especially if in the same colourway - €49

* Generic Knits: Having a few grey and cream jumpers in your preferred neckline
  is a way to expand.

##Tailoring (Pants)
Dresses and skirting are so passé[^womenswear]. Tailored trousers are the new
frontier. Experimenting with different lengths, rises, and taper to find what
works best for you is important, but generally what you're looking for is:

* Nice fabric; does the wool feel cheap and scratchy? Is it already pilling in
  the store? Is it holding a crease?

* Look for fully lined trousers for winter warmth. Lighter fabrics like poplin
  and linen can serve in even the hottest climates.

* If tucking in a shirt a higher rise is imperative

---

* [COS Skinny Fit
  Trousers](http://www.cosstores.com/Store/Women/Trousers/Skinny_fit_trousers/46887-3490639.1#c-4116680):

* [COS Backzip
  Trousers](http://www.cosstores.com/Store/Women/Trousers/Trousers_with_back_zip/46887-940984.1#c-5037219):
  For those day sans blazer, these sit closer to the hips for a more casual
  look - €69


##Denim
The best denim fit varies so much from person to person that my recommendation
is to head down to the nearest metro area and try on as much as you can. A
skinny or cigarette fit is flattering to a wide range of body types. One pair of
indigo and one in black should be enough for a basic wardrobe. Try not to spend
more than €70-80[^rawdenim] on anything with elastene or spandex. 

##Footwear
In footwear you are looking for something that continues the line of the leg and
elongates your silhouette. It's a bit difficult to find lower-priced
alternatives here, so upgrade when you can! If a shoe is a clone of something
higher-priced, I've tried to mention it. The absolute basics that you need are:

* A black, non-patent, leather pump between 85mm and 100mm without platform, and
  almond toe. Round is very juvenile, while pointed comes in and out of style. 

* A flat Chelsea boot or Sidezip, grey suede or black leather advised.

* A heeled bootie 

* An Oxford, black and brown.

* Trainers: A nice minimal trainer is great - if you're not trail running it can
  even do double duty as an exercise shoe.

  Could not find one I loved. Something like this without platform should be
  available at your local shoe shop. 

##Accessories
More examples to come!

### Jewelery
People are generally either bracelet, earring, or necklace types. Save up for
great pieces that fulfill your lust and skimp a tiny bit on areas less important
to you. Metallics go excellently with the limited palette outlined above.
Blogger [Ivania Carpio of Love Aesthetics is an excellent
example](http://love-aesthetics.blogspot.com/).

### Scarves
Long, thick, and chunky knits for the winter, silk in warmer months. Try and
pick a colour distinct from the rest of your outfit, and never announce the
football club you support with your neck.

1351131995.0,74,self.femalefashionadvice,121lhc,On Improving your Fashion Photography,,84,10,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/121lhc/on_improving_your_fashion_photography/,"I know many of you have cameras sitting around and you're using them on automatic and frankly, you've got a very powerful tool my friends and you owe it to yourselves to know how to use it. I'll post my five tips first, followed by a post of camera jargon to explain the terms I used.

**1) Get someone else to take the picture!** It's less stressful. Seriously. I hate messing around with remotes, tripods and self-timers, it just doesn't amount to the same thing. Your real friends won't judge you for wanting you to take a picture. If you really have no one... use a tripod and a remote. The camera lens on most DSLR's don't focus right before taking a picture, but when you half press the shutter. These remotes allow you to remotely half press the shutter, allowing for a picture that has perfect focus. But more on focus later.

**2) Posing:** I'm nowhere near a model, just a hobby photographer. But let's put it this way: there's a reason why the great masters tended to paint 3/4 portraits. Frontal body shots tend to be better to show off an outfit though. So it really depends on your utility. If you're posting to a personal blog, close ups are good and stuff. FFA fit check? Frontal is always best.

**3) Lighting:** Get outside! The best light is natural light, it's soft and diffused by the trusty stratosphere. If you can't get get outside, try and get near a big window where natural light can come in. I'd avoid taking pictures at night, flash is distracting and not very flattering unless you have an external flash and properly sync it/use a diffuser.

**4) Wide open aperture**: The smaller the aperture number, the wider the aperture size. Here are illustrated examples, as they say a picture is worth a thousand words. [One](http://www.wildlife-photography-tips.com/images/dofEg.jpg), [two](http://fc05.deviantart.com/fs29/i/2008/109/8/1/Depth_of_Field_Tutorial_1_by_killrb323.jpg), [three](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-48jvzTzN-qc/TrqompMmDtI/AAAAAAAAA1I/yUWpeIFnhGo/s1600/dof.jpg). Generally, a wide open aperture will have two results: a pretty soft focus background (also known as bokeh/shallow depth of field) but a bitch of a time to focus. Depending on what kind of camera you have, here's an easy way to go about it:

* Point and shoot: Simple cameras, most of the tiny handhelds. Most point and shoots can have the aperture as wide as f 2.7. You can find out the aperture of your lens by looking around the rim of the lens. Most point and shoots can access this f 2.7 aperture via ""portrait"" option, though some point and shoots are more customizable than others. Go ahead and shoot!

* DSLR: Digital Single Lens Reflex. The bigger cameras with the removable lens. Most DSLR's come with a lens. It's usually an 18-55mm f 3.5 - 5.6 kit lens. The f 3.5 is usually not wide enough to result in super blurry backgrounds, and to access this 3.5 you have to change your focal length to 18mm, which will minimize the blurry wonderfulness even further. I would suggest, if your budget allows, to pick up an f 1.8 lens. If you haven an entry level DSLR, you'll unfortunately need a lens with a motor. They run for about 200 dollars, but they'll be the best investment ever. I never take my f 1.8 off my lens. The f 1.4 is even better, hell the f 1.2, 85mm on a crop is one of the greatest portait lenses ever IMO.

I suggest working your way up from the following modes until you get used to working absolutely everything on manual.

* Simple mode: Set your camera to Aperture priority (A on a Nikon), set your ISO to between 100 (bright sunlight) and 400 (indirect sunlight), set your aperture to f 1.8 and shoot.

* Slightly harder mode: Set your camera to Aperture priority, set your aperture to f 1.8, set your ISO to between 100 (bright sunlight) and 400 (indirect sunlight), set your aperture to f 1.8, set your focus to spot metering at your focus style to AF-S, and use your trackpad to manually select your focus point (for portraits, aim on faces).

* Hard mode: Set your camera to Manual, set your aperture to f 1.8, set your ISO to between 100 (bright sunlight) and 400 (indirect sunlight), set your aperture to f 1.8, set your focus to spot metering at your focus style to AF-S, and use your trackpad to manually select your focus point (for portraits, aim on faces) and you will need to custom pick your shutter speed. Usually, your camera has a meter built in when you look through the viewfinder. Try and get that meter in the centre to properly expose your picture.

* Super Hard Self-Portrait Mode: If using a self timer and a tripod (i.e. you have no control over focus except trial and error, a quick dirty method is just to lower the aperture to give you more room to be off focus. There are special calculators for this job, ie calculating where the focal length will be. I try to use hyperfocal distancing as much as possible, but for a precise but time consuming method I occasionally do for self portraits:

1) Frame the shot

2) Set down an object as to where you want to take the picture from, and set your tripod where you would be standing

3) Stand exactly where the object is, and auto focus on the tripod head (use your focus points!). SWITCH IT RIGHT AWAY TO MANUAL FOCUS!!!! (The switch is on the lens)

4) Put down a different object where the tripod was, and place the tripod where the original object was.

5) Fix up all your settings (namely: metering, aperture, shutter speed, ISO)

6) Set your camera to self timer

7) Stand exactly where you put the second object

8) Voila!


**5) Location**: To extend the illusion of an even shallower depth of field, one must have an infinite background. Depth of field in a photo can be illustrated as [such.](http://www.edbergphoto.com/images/dof-cartoon.gif) If you aim for a shallow depth of field, that means anything farther from a focal point will essentially be interpreted as even blurrier by the lens. So, try and find a location where you can see as far as possible. Long city streets or long rural roads come to mind, instead of up against a wall.",[Guide],False,self,t5_2s8o5,False,guide,,True,t3_121lhc,http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/121lhc/on_improving_your_fashion_photography/,

1362064629.0,75,self.femalefashionadvice,19ectu,[Help!] Job interview where I was told explicitly to dress casually. Not sure if serious or mind games.,GeekyAine,82,7,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/19ectu/help_job_interview_where_i_was_told_explicitly_to/,"**Why**: Job interview that specifically asked me to ""dress casually."" The interviewer said, verbatim, ""I almost forgot, do not worry about dressing up. I forget to tell some applicants that and they show up in a suit and wind up being at a disadvantage because they're uncomfortable and we're all in jeans and t-shirts.""

This is an interview for a marketing position. The company is very laid back, but I want to look more fashionable than just jeans. (Although I do have some new dark wash that I'm in love with).

**Important downside**: I'm going to be wearing this over an hour on the metro, and have to walk a few blocks afterwards, so the downside is that it has to be at least a bit comfortable, which doesn't seem to coincide with pretty very often. It did mean I was relieved when she offered me the option to show up in anything accept my usual interview suit.

- Height: 5'2""
- Weight: 175 (size 16)
- Age: 28
- Body type: slight hourglass, but given my size, assume I look more apple shaped.
- Hair: useless. It's down to mid-back, brunette/auburn, so straight you could use it as a plumb line, very fine, but thick - usually lays down and plays dead.
- Skin: so pale that I was teased for being ""light green"" in high school.

**Background/horror story**: The last time I had a potential employer tell me that their environment was ""very casual,"" I still showed up in a suit (because it was an interview, duh), and all the women there were in fashionable dresses, stockings, full hair/makeup, no heels lower than 4"", and no one was larger than a size 2. They were all fresh-out-of-college, stab-you-in-the-face, mega-alpha, sell-or-die recent business grads working in straight-up competitive sales. I was interviewed by a kid who must have been barely 21 who was wearing a full 3-piece bespoke suit (silk vest, cufflinks, the works).

In hindsight, I'm so very, very glad that they thought I wouldn't fit their corporate culture. Yikes.

**Me now**: On days off, I am a jeans and a shirt.woot kind of girl. Usually, I have a black skirt suit I use for interviews. When I try to do business casual, it's usually:

- charcoal grey slacks, 
- [black shoes kind of like this](http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/img-thing?.out=jpg&amp;amp;size=l&amp;amp;tid=34971619), 
- a button up shirt (usually solid purple or maroon), 
- if it's cold, my black and white herringbone jacket (which I get a lot of complements on)
- and a black, utilitarian laptop bag that [looks a bit like this](http://img1.targetimg1.com/wcsstore/TargetSAS//img/p/10/13/10138344.jpg) (bleh, I know, but I have to carry samples of my work on my laptop, and I've never found a pretty way to do that.)

**Budget**: Looking mostly for general suggestions, but think Kohls-level quality if you want to suggest a new, specific piece. Assume I have a lot of the basics: slacks, shirts, and I even have a fun blue and green hipster scarf. Mostly I'm looking for what pieces to slot together to dress up without making the interviewer uncomfortable.

Sorry for the wall of text. Thank you in advance for any advice you can offer. 

**tldr**: Help me, FFA-kenobi, you're my only hope. (Seriously. Plan B is going around to my hipster friends and having them play dress up with me).

Edit/Update

Just got home and I nailed it! (And it wasn't a ruse!)

Tiny bit dressier than everyone but only because of the blazer. Advice that everyone gave here was 100% invaluable. Made it so I could set out clothes days ahead of time and just make sure they were lint free and wrinkle free the day before. 

Normally, I'm intensely uncomfortable during interviews because I'm so self-conscious about how I look. This time, I was at ease and everything seemed to fall into place. 

Thanks to everyone who commented here. You all are amazing and I couldn't have done it without you. ",,False,self,t5_2s8o5,1362514741.0,,,True,t3_19ectu,http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/19ectu/help_job_interview_where_i_was_told_explicitly_to/,

It's perhaps a little too easy to dismiss these incidents as being ""tragic, but not my problem"" -- a sentiment that was [unfortunately common in MFA's discussion last week](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1d13br/bangladesh_garment_factory_collapse_kills_at/).

I'd like to have a realistic conversation on ethics and social responsibility in this context.  Justifications for the textile industry range from ethically or socially sensitive (the industry helps people) to neutral (it's not my country/problem) to selfish (I want cheap clothes).  Some of the most common defenses of the textile industry include:

* **Workers want those jobs**.  The workers would not choose those jobs if they didn't want to be there.

* **Even shitty jobs empower women**.  Textile workers are overwhelmingly young women who have few other options available.

* **It's not the consumer's job to enforce human rights**. Governments are responsible for protecting their own citizens.

* **We need to address problems at home before problems abroad**.  This assumes that we are only capable of dedicating mental and physical resources to one pursuit at a time.  (Kind of like the ""why help women when minorities suffer too???"" argument in men's rights.)

* **The industry is helping developing economies**.  The textile industry is often a huge percentage of GDP in developing nations; China exports ~$120 billion of textiles per year, and Bangladesh close to $16 billion.

* **The market has to work itself out**.  Market forces operate best without interference.  If consumers wanted to push for ethical manufacturing, it would have happened by now.

* **Ethical standards vary**.  It's not fair to hold Bangladesh to the same labor standards as Canada because their people are used to different standards.  (As if the right not to die in a factory collapse is merely a *cultural difference*.)

* **Ethics are all-or-nothing**:  If you want to buy clothes ethically, then you have to buy everything ethically; otherwise, you're a hypocrite.

* **People can't afford more expensive clothing**.  Not much to justify this one, besides the fact that it's patently false.  Otherwise, we wouldn't be trashing 80% of the clothes we buy.

* **

Some questions to consider:

* How legitimate are these arguments?

* How ethical are these arguments?

* Do you believe in collective social responsibility for human rights?

* How analogous is the contemporary textile industry to the Industrial Revolution in North America and Europe?  Can we expect a similar timeline and similar results?

* With growth far outpacing basic infrastructure, how sustainable is the industry in countries like Bangladesh?

* What will be the long-term environmental effects of the textile industry?

* What can we do differently?

HELP",wtfjen,80,8,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1g35uf/im_a_tall_awkward_girl_with_broad_shoulders_and/,"Height: 5'11""

Weight: 142 lbs

Age: 20

Bust: 36""

Under bust: 32""

Waist: 27""

Hips (around butt): 38""

Inseam: 34""

Shoulders: 45""

Shoe size: 11

Body type: According to the body type calculator, I'm an hourglass. My shoulders make me feel like I'm a triangle/strawberry/swimmer's body. Since I'm tall and skinny, I often feel like a pencil/banana/ruler.

**The problem:** Trying on clothes is really frustrating because nothing seems to fit well. I don't think that my body is *that* oddly shaped, so I think the issues lies in my lack of knowledge of what would best complement my figure. That's where I need help. After literally years of searching, I've found multiple pairs of jeans that are actually long enough (all Levis!) and are a good mix of skinny but not skin-tight. I think what I need to work on now is shirts to go with them. (Maybe shoes too, if we can get that far. I currently have a pair of Vans that I wear with everything.)

Style: I don't have much of one. Currently, I wear t-shirts and skinny jeans almost every day. I like darker colors usually. If I'm not in a t-shirt, I'm in a v-neck. I'm not a girly-girl; dresses and skirts make me uncomfortable. I'm modest and don't wear any makeup. I'm not looking to stand out from the crowd with my killer style, but I would like to look decent and hop out of my t-shirt phase. I don't know the names of many specific styles, but I'd like to see myself in the layered, flowy things. You know, what you see a ton of on college campuses. 

Budget: I'm a frugal college kid. I can't imagine spending more than $20 on a shirt, maybe $30 for a sweater. Tailoring seems totally out of the question, as I'm just looking for casual things to wear to class and stuff. My typical shop stops are at TJ Maxx, Forever 21, and thrift stores.

As part of the moderator's efforts to broaden the scope of the FFA Community and encourage diversification of the subreddit we're making an attempt to expand the sidebar and bring it more in-line with the quantity of information offered by our male subreddit-in-arms, MFA. Unlike them, we want to avoid being proscriptive; female fashion is far more varied, and women tend to be more educated than men when it comes to knowing how items should fit, patterns should match, etc.

Over the past few weeks there have seen a few requests for ""Starter Kits"" (or, as we like to call them ""Stepford Husband Guides""). Rather than encouraging that behaviour, we've collaborated on this post, which outlines one way of finding a mode of dress that appeals to you, inspires confidence in yourself, and is generalizable to every body-type and niche.

With that said, we're happy to present to you

Finding a Style, Building a Wardrobe
---
___
Once you understand the basic elements of style - the central tenets of fit, silhouette, and colour coordination - it is not an uncommon to start desiring to cultivate a personal aesthetic. Whether you eventually find your satisfaction in the staid, [tried](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/9061771/FFA%20Fashion/Wardrobe/1-Prep1.jpg)-and-[true](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/9061771/FFA%20Fashion/Wardrobe/1-Prep2.png) preppy aesthetic or end up on the [cutting](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/9061771/FFA%20Fashion/Wardrobe/2-CuttingEdge1.jpg)-[edge](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/9061771/FFA%20Fashion/Wardrobe/2-CuttingEdge2.jpg) hopefully this guide will help you discover what makes you happy.

Fortunately, there's no reason to step blindly into the unknown on your quest for sartorial independence - there are numerous resources that can help you develop a knowledge of the huge variety of options out there and serve as sources of inspiration. A large part of developing your own aesthetic is building on what has come before, so leveraging these assets can only help to accelerate the process.

While they can't compete with the quantity of information available on the internet, one should not discount the value of books. For gaining a better understanding of how garments are created, learning the history of garments from  the pantsuit to the high heel, or delving into fashion theory, get reading. Recommendations include Fashion Theory: A Reader and The Japanese Revolution in Paris Fashion.

Finding Your Interests
---
___
The most difficult part of the whole process is determining what it is you're interested in - there's no shortage of choices, from the avant garde to the clasically chic, there's someone producing for every niche. Whether they be small, independent designers or corporate giants the quickest path to discovering them is via the internet.

To start your search think of a character from a TV show or movie whose style you particularly enjoyed. Search [Polyvore](http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/search.sets) for their name or the title of what they were in and (hopefully) it will turn up hundreds of sets of clothes that draw inspiration from that character's style, or provide exact lists of what they wore in a particular scence. Use these for styling ideas, but also take note of the brand names and stores that pop up repeatedly. 

Next, turn to [tumblr](http://tumblr.com) and start pumping those brand names into the search box. Click through to a few blogs and see if the first few posts appeal at all. If they do, follow them. It's much easier to cut down on feeds you don't enjoy later than spend hours trying to find one you wish you'd followed. Save all the images and posts that appeal to you in one form or another - I particularly enjoy using [Pinterest](http://pinterest.com) for this, as it's easy to quickly scan through your archive at a later date and cull or categorise as you see fit. Once again, if you notice particular brands popping up over and over and it's not already on your list, write it down.

By now, you'll hopefully have a bevy of blogs to browse for inspiration, plenty of pinnned favourites, and a score or more of retailers to search for items of interest. With that information at your fingertips, it's time for the next stage:

Trying and Buying
---
___
Once you've more or less identified the styles and aesthetics that appeal to you through extensive browsing, it is imperative to visit physical stores and try garments on in person. Try to find stockists that carry brands of interest and develop a feel for their sizing, how items can be combined, and start developing a relationship with a sales associate at stores you plan to frequent.  

When experimenting with a new style, start off by purchasing inexpensive items - this does not mean be cheap, but frugal. For designer and high-end clothing, rather than buying new, check eBay for an item, and sell things that don't work out. On the lower end, or for trend items you don't see lasting more than a few seasons, stop in at H&amp;M, Zara, or Topshop and pick up some pieces on the cheap. Their occasional designer collaborations, while not of a much higher quality than their typical offerings, can give you a chance to mix in  novel concepts without breaking the bank. Thrifting and consignment shopping can also yield gold with frequent visits, especially for those residing in metropolitan or affluent areas.

Most importantly, don't decide on a style without having worn it for a while. Pick up a few outfits, mix and match, see how others react, and how you feel. If you come up with something that you love right away, that's great, but don't set it in stone until you research further and are certain it is the direction you wish to go in. Only then is it time to start investing heavily in a wardrobe.

Going Further
---
___
Once you discover the message to convey through your garments, it's time to assess what items will add the most to your wardrobe and cement your aesthetic, a careful balancing act of versatility and self-satisfaction. It is not uncommon to find an item that immediately grabs your attention, but if it wouldn't mesh with your current wardrobe or work with two or three items at most, it's not a worthwhile purchase (for the time being). Unless you lack clothing mandatory for a particular activity, such as a job with a  dress code or uniform, you do not need an item, and certainly not an expensive designer one. To put it more succinctly, wait to purchase until you find the perfect piece.

So what should you buy? Find the key pieces that will anchor a chosen identity to your person. For example, if you were interested in the classic preppy look and wanted to project the image of being vaguely sporty, nonchalantly put-together, and ultimately practical, a classic Barbour raincoat of indeterminate age might be a staple of your wardrobe. A gallery owner or curator on the other hand, may be far more attracted to the minimalism of designers such as Jil Sander and instead invest in sparsely detailed outerwear that reveals its provenance only to others of similar taste. 

Once you have identified what impression it is your trying to send, shopping by brand starts to become a useful tool for filtering material of interest ouf of the rapidly evolving and ever changing fashion industry. Think of them as similar to the tags and categories assigned to posts on blogs -  Gap might be associated with “plain”, “utilitarian”, “functional”, while Brooks Brothers might be “staid”, “traditional”, and “heritage”. Both our prep aficionado and modernist would pass over these, and instead search for ones described as ""heritage"", ""classic"", ""pastel"", or “refined”, “subtle”, and “minimal”. Either might come across a shirt that is atypical of a brand, say something from Versace that appeals to the futurist, and is an excellent addition to their wardrobe. They should not ignore it or skip purchasing, but it would still be a waste to follow each new collection because those items are so rare. Finding a boutique that tends to make buys matching your aesthetic is another discovery mechanism to consider. Many of these have blogs where buys and info about up-and-coming brands are posted and can be an excellent source of new finds.

At some point in your aesthetic journey your focus may begin to change, perhaps drifting from tarants and pastels to high fashion and the catwalks of Europe - whether due to a change in living situation or an evolution of taste, embrace it. Bill Cunningham, of NYTimes fame, calls fashion “the armour to survive the reality of everyday life.” If some change calls for different armour, so be it! Never let your style be constrained by how you might have dressed in the past.

I spent the day at the beach today, and when I came home and looked in the mirror I thought the same thing I always think when I see myself in a bikini. Why do I look great naked but bad in a bikini? And how can I fix it?

I'm 23 years old, 5'8"", pear shaped (more like [flask](http://image1.masterfile.com/em_w/05/09/95/400-05099563fw.jpg) shaped, but whatever), 140 pounds, 30F, size 6/8, and very fair skinned.  I like the way my body looks.  But when I put a bikini on it, I hate it! I wear small or medium sized panties with no muffin top, but no matter how big I buy my bikini bottoms, I always muffin out a little on the sides. Even in a custom made bikini! It is similarly hard to fit 30F boobs, but once again, even my custom made bikini top disappoints me. 

What can I do to make my bikini body more accurately reflect my naked body? Any tips on finding bottoms that won't make me magically grow love handles? Maybe I'm wearing the wrong color for my skin tone? Prints vs. solids? Idk. I did try to use the search feature, but I couldn't find exactly what I was looking for. I hope this isn't a repeatedly asked question.

I'm a law clerk.  I sit in on hearings and trials almost daily.  I notice that a lot of the female lawyers go without them.  I'm probably the only one in the office who wears them!  The problem is, I have a large tattoo on my foot - not professional.  I cover it with dermablend, then wear hose to complete the coverage (even the shear ones add the final touch to cover that baby completely).  It also helps the makeup from rubbing off during the day and getting on my shoes.  Not to mention, I like the control top, especially the kind that goes up to my bra (everything fits better), and I like the way my shoes feel with hose.  

With pants, I wear knee-highs instead.  But my wardrobe is pretty lacking in the pants department right now (weigh gain).  So I've been wearing skirts 4x a week.

Problems: they don't last long; it gets expensive.  I have a hard time getting a lot of wears without snagging them.  And, its summer.  TMI: my vag isn't liking it.  

What the hell?  Any tips?  Am I completely fuddy-duddy donning the hose all the time?

At first. Even though I have barely scratched the surface of following fashion blogs in order to just see what's out there. I live in a relatively fashion-backward area of the country and there aren't a lot of real people in my immediate vicinity who have any style to speak of. (Not sure what's going on over at the college, as I have long graduated.)

Like many here, I am on a quest to pare down my wardrobe and settle on a true and long-term personal style. But I don't want to be so deliberate about it that it's artificial. So his message makes me go ""Yeah! Heck yeah!"" I want my style to uphold the activities and values that I actually have in my life, and no one wants to be thought of as a poser, but I also want to know what it is that I'm doing and what all of my options are. Hence all the ""research.""

Here are some questions that occurred to me:

* Is he effectively making a straw man argument? Wouldn't most people - the readers of the blogs, that is - gravitate naturally toward the looks that resonate with who they are? Is this really a problem or just a claim that reveals that he is insulated in his own world of bloggers reading and competing with other bloggers?

* Is authenticity possible? I know there was a thread on MFA about it recently, and it's one of those eternally thorny issues that gets into ultra-meta territory.

* Didn't ""authentic"" styles arise because the people who started them only had maybe one prevailing style to either identify with or rebel against? It seems like the only way to be authentic is to lose all of your awareness of alternatives.

Inspired by the post on alternative styles the other day, an album inspired by cyberpunk.  I should probably clarify that this is more of an album inspired by cyberpunk tv shows / books /etc than cyberpunks themselves.

**Definition:**
&gt;Cyberpunk is a Speculative Fiction genre centered around the transformative effects of advanced science, information technology, computers and networks (""cyber"") coupled with a breakdown or radical change in the social order (""punk""). 

&gt;A genre that is dark and cynical in tone, it borrows elements from Film Noir, hard-boiled Detective Fiction and postmodern deconstruction to describe the Dystopian side of an electronic society.

(from [tv tropes](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyberPunk))

**Album:**

[94 images, best viewed on imgur](http://imgur.com/a/oQLZN)

*Why cyberpunk? how is this relevant?*

If you haven't seen them already, go look at /u/kyungc's techwear inspiration albums over at /r/malefashionadvice.  Now imagine that style 50 years down the road.  That's what this is aiming for.

Clothing has always been about function.  Styles like fair isle and cable knitting aren't just decorative, they make the sweater warmer.  This is a case where synthetics aren't the enemy--we have the technology to make fabrics like goretex, fabrics so functional that we can go back and look at the form.  (If you're interested in this sort of thing, there's an interesting article [here](http://032c.com/2011/archetype/) about Veilance, Arc'teryx's fashion-y brand.)

Clothing isn't just about surviving the elements, either.  Let's face it--most of us live pretty cushy city lives.  When I bike, I'm somewhat concerned about the rain, but more concerned about getting hit by a car or my headphones dislodging themselves from my ear.  In backpacks, I am interested in things like [battery powered LED strips](http://depth.kr/front/php/product.php?product_no=539&amp;main_cate_no=101&amp;display_group=1).  In jackets, integrated phone / headphone pockets.  In other words, fashion that integrates with technology.  

I think part of the reason I love cyberpunk novels is that I'm studying electrical engineering, and I see us progressing towards it everyday.  We're not talking RFID chips embedded under your skin yet (though I know somebody who did that), just RFID chips in your name badge, only active for the week of a conference. In engineering, sci-fi is the what-if that inspires us to create new things, cyberpunk is the what-if that lurks in the shadows of those inventions.

I'm trying to discover what looks good on me, but it's pretty difficult to find stuff that works for me. After trying lots of stuff that just looks.. horrible it's hard to keep motivated and keep trying. I don't want to disappear into baggy masculine clothes and give up. I would really like to express my femininity more. I'm hoping you all can be of some help.

I'd rather not post a picture at this point, so I'll describe my body a bit. I'm tall, 1m90/6'3"" tall. Lucky for me, I live in a european country where women taller than 6' are actually pretty common but it's still an issue. Tall women tend to be slender, and I'm certainly not. I have a bit of a mangut going on (working on it!), which is hard to hide. My weight is about 95 kilograms (about 210 pounds according to Google).

I have some breast growth, but it's still less than an A-cup. My shoulders aren't that wide for a male body, but in terms of womens clothes.. they are.

I have somewhat of a waist, which is probably my most feminine feature and would obviously like to accentuate. 

Also, proportionally to my body, I have really long legs.

What seems to work reasonable well, is a simple shirt (not tucked in, because of the big gut) + a cardigan + jeans. But it is kinda boring to always wear.

I like skirts, but I'm not entirely sure I can pull them off as they make my legs look really long which sort of makes me look like a potato on cocktail sticks.

Dresses.. are difficult. My lack of breasts is really visible, as is my gut. I love the thought of them, though. But I do want to avoid the classic ""man in a dress""-look, which is horrible.

Anyone have any advice that could help me?

So I've considered three options:

* Keep wearing it with the bra

* Buy a [stick on bra](http://www.amazon.com/Braza-Petal-Reusable-Nipple-Covers/dp/B00CMXKJXQ/ref=pd_sim_a_59) (since they add no volume and I'm pretty flat already, I think it would make the dress look weird)

* Buy those chicken cutlet bra things (would add volume but they are expensive and probably wouldn't fit me)

Also, I've seen this style of dress on friends who usually have more cleavage and the dress ends up looking sexy on them, sorta like [this](http://www.polyvore.com/mesh_inset_ponte_peplum_dress/thing?id=60579615). Am I not, uhhh... chesty enough to wear it?

I wear a lot of dresses and skirts. Actually that's almost all I wear.

I feel like I prefer cardigans paired with pants or shorts because the way they end up looking with dresses/skirts kind of feels frumpy to me. Do you have suggestions for other options? I've tried out denim jackets that I feel okay about. I don't really own a single blazer and I know that could be an option but they've always felt too formal for me. Help!

Unfortunately, my availability to post on scheduled times is spotty for the next few weeks. The brunt of the work load has fallen on /u/kale_no's shoulders while we're figuring out how to fix this (both bot and modship rotation).

I'm still tweaking the code, so I apologize in advance if it catches/removes your post by mistake.   Contact us via modmail if you encounter any issues with the bot. Do not message this bot directly, we can't check the messages it receives.

* **Getting the FFA_Moderator auto-posting up and running again**: /u/Schiaparelli is working on getting it back up and operational.  Keep poking her on this one.

* **Fix/Add Recurring Thread Schedules**: We have a few ideas in mind on what to add and how to re-arrange the schedules, but we'd like to hear your suggestions as well!  Post your ideas below!!!

Thank you for SO many reasons. I have two older sisters: one was very skinny and petite (even when she did gain some weight she still was tiny)  and the other was very athletic and gorgeous... Then there was me, I for as long as I can remember I've had pudge (booty and boobs). Throughout high school a trip to the department store just became a bout of depression and sadness in the changing room when things never fit. I hated buying dress clothes and clothes shopping so I resorted to a regular wardrobe of t-shirts and jeans. 

With the help of this subreddit (and a few others) I've come to realize that it isn't any fault of my own that the stores I was taken to catered to slimmer girls and that there are places for me to shop! I've ordered some basic outfits and even some bras that are my size! I'm so eager for them to arrive in the mail! I'm about to turn 20 and I can't wait to look fabulous this summer.

[Here](http://imgur.com/a/CdecR) are some dresses I've already bought. I don't really own any accesories and I plan on buying some red shoes that match the bag I bought. Once I get more clothes mailed I will totally upload them here so I can get some critiques.

So I just bought these Louboutin shoes at Chatuchak flea market in Bangkok for 450 baht, which is around $15 US dollars. I realized that there was a good chance that they're fake but, hey, at least I'd've paid a small amount for a good knock-off. Would you ladies mind helping me check them out?

http://www.cheapredbottomshoes.eu/christian-louboutin-pigalle-120mm-glitter-pointed-toe-pumps-black.html These would be the closest match I can find to them online. 

And lastly, I know this isn't really related to the title but they're not in the best of shape and if you guys could give me any tips on fixing them up that would be great! The glitter is coming off a little, you can see it on the inside of the shoe and on one of the shoes the little tab at the bottom of the heel is a little unstable. They're a little rough around the edges in general. 

 I do intend to take them to a cobbler or something either way, but any advice would be good. 

Thanks for all the help! 

EDIT* Upon further inspection this morning, I can confirm that they are fake.

The o and the u don't join together on the shoe, and the o next to the b looks different, not to mention the dot on the i is smudged together. It's a shame because I really thought I'd gotten lucky.

I bought a few different things, mostly as per the advice of people in that thread, and also a few things I picked out on my own. I am wondering how all of you think they look on me. 

First off, I bought a few shirts in different sizes from Everlane. I'm trying to decide if I should keep the medium or small. Here are the medium crew neck and medium v neck on me:

[Medium](http://imgur.com/a/AfNjt)

And here is the small v neck:

[Small](http://imgur.com/a/p5l0d)

I like the way the small fits around my waist better, but I'm not sure if it pulls too much around my chest. Also, the jeans are my new dark wash skinny jeans. Do they look ok? I've been wondering if I shouldn't try to look for a lower rise. I like the style of half-tucking, but I feel like it makes my torso look really stumpy because my boobs are kind of big. Will a lower rise balance me out?

I also bought a Ryan tee. I LOVE it, especially the way it drapes when I half-tuck it. What do you think? Is my judgement good?

[Ryan](http://imgur.com/a/uvVTO)

I tried one of their silk shirts in white, but I think I'll eventually end up with the grey if I get one. I just didn't want to wait for it to come back in stock. This one is a medium. Should I get a small? I know it's supposed to be kind of drapey and loose, but I think it looks too loose to me. I even have room in the bust, which is rare for me.

[Silk shirt](http://imgur.com/a/tvef1)

Also, I tried out two pairs of lighter color cropped jeans with a navy striped shirt. What do you think? Are they flattering or should I return them? Should I get the shirt hemmed to the length in the last picture? And are the navy wedges cute or old lady-ish?

This hit me on the head while replying to an item evaluation request. Wanted to toss this suggestion out there since many people are doing the French Wardrobe methodology.




Most of the times when I have seen people post about an item and request advice, whether it be boots, a shirt, a tunic, only a single outfit picture was attached for us to use for giving them advice.


For those that have a goal of focusing on a curated wardrobe, it would be great if you would show us several configurations. You've been carefully selecting your jeans, your shoes, your skirts, etc. A lot of us are aiming to get new items that add many permutations. Items that play well with  existing wardrobe components. Show us more of the ways you plan to wear it!




Here's a practical example. If you've just bought some amazing oxford shoes, I'd love to see them in EVERY WAY that you plan to wear them. With your skinny jeans. With socks. Without socks. With boot cut jeans. With tights and your skirts. With dresses. With black skinnies. Roll 'em up, too! Items that can only be worn one or two ways have limited utility, and a curated, minimalistic wardrobe craves maximizing viable permutations.

As you all know, downvotes have been disabled for some time now. Of course, downvotes still happen, but there are a few disturbing trends - namely that they are still, and perhaps more often than before, being used to abuse reddiquette. Downvotes are **not** for burying advice you disagree with (people on this sub do have different styles! what a shock!) or for punishing a user who has elsewhere said something you disagree with. If you *must* downvote, be mature about it and use it for off-topic or irrelevant comments. For those of you who may need a refresher, here's [reddiquette.](http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/reddiquette)

If we don't have downvotes, what's to be done about offensive posts? See that little ""report"" button below each comment or post? Click that if you feel that the post is harmful to our community. The moderation team cannot see who has reported a post, so no need to worry. Examples of comments or posts that should be reported include crude insults, sexual come-ons and other comments, and obvious spam. **The ""report"" button is not for advice that you dislike or personally disagree with.**

Never paid attention to fashion? Want to develop a style but don’t know how? This is a starters guide for prospective beginners in women’s fashion.


### Making your post


We can’t help you unless you help us a little first. When making your first post, please include as much of the following information as possible:

* **Height**

* **Weight**

* **Age**

* **Body type**: This can be identified [here](http://www.shopyourshape.com/calculate-your-body-shape.html).

* **Why?** Why are you looking to dress better? For example, “I just want to dress better.” Or, “I want to dress more professionally for work.” Or, “I want to look more my age.”

* **You now**: How would you describe your current style? What are your favorite items of clothing that you currently wear? Do you not like skirts or dresses? Do you not feel comfortable wearing heels?

* **You after**: How would you describe the style you would like to achieve? Preppy? Edgy? Conservative? Loud? Do you like prints and patterns? Or maybe neutral colors?

* **Budget**: This is very important. We need to know what kind of budget you are looking to work with in order to be able to suggest viable options to you. If you’ve only got $50 to spare, it would be futile to recommend you $200 shoes. If you wipe your ass with million dollar checks, telling you to check out Forever 21 and ASOS would be stupid.

### Pictures

Pictures are probably the most helpful thing you can provide. I understand it’s uncomfortable for some people to post pictures of themselves on the internet, but if you can find a way to block out whatever you don’t want to share, it would be helpful to provide pictures of:

* Your body

* Your current style of dress

* Outfits and styles that you like (can be culled from magazines, blogs, tumblrs, celebrity gossip sites, fashion forums, movie stills, etc. See “Resources,” below)

### Regarding haircuts and glasses:

If asking for advice on a haircut or glasses, **please** try as hard as possible to provide pictures of your face. Trying to suggest these things for someone without knowing the shape or look of their face is like trying to buy a book for someone without knowing what language they speak. Face shape is *imperative.*

Also, if asking about haircuts, please provide information regarding:

* Current length of your hair

* Goal length

* Bangs or no bangs?

* Is your hair straight? Curly? Wavy? Coarse? Smooth? Thin? Thick?

* How much time are you willing to commit to doing your hair every day? Are you comfortable with using product?

You can also check out [/r/FancyFollicles](/r/FancyFollicles) for hair advice!

Perhaps this can eventually be its own guide.

### Resources

There are many resources available to you in terms of getting exposed to fashion. These include, but are certainly not limited to:

* Magazines: Vogue (US Edition and International Editions), Elle, Marie Claire, Lucky, Nylon, Women’s Wear Daily, Paper Mag, Flaunt, Surface

* [Style.com](http://www.style.com): Great for runway shows. 

* [Tumblr](http://www.tumblr.com): A quick blogging site. If you create your own Tumblr, not only can you post your own content to your Tumblr, but you can “follow” other Tumblrs, like their posts, and reblog them to your own Tumblr. A great way to explore Tumblr is by searching tags. For example, [“fashion”](http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/fashion), [“style”](http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/style), and [“womenswear”]
(http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/womenswear).

* [Bloglovin](http://www.bloglovin.com): This is an easy way to keep tabs on multiple blogs at once. Sign up for an account and then browse the blogs. You can start by looking at blogs that have the most followers. These blogs include 

    [The Glamourai](http://www.theglamourai.com/)

    [Song of Style](http://songofstyle.blogspot.com/)

    [Sea of Shoes](http://seaofshoes.typepad.com/)
 
    [Fashion Squad](http://www.fashionsquad.com/)

    [Fashion Toast](http://www.fashiontoast.com) 

    Also, check out [what previous FFA’errs have suggested]( http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/search?q=blogs&amp;restrict_sr=on).

* Street style websites: These websites take pictures of peoples’ outfits and styles in the “real world.” Popular street style sites include 

    [The Sartorialist](http://www.thesartorialist.blogspot.com)

    [Jak &amp; Jil](http://www.jakandjil.com)

    [Face Hunter](http://www.facehunter.blogspot.com)

    There are many, many more, as street style has become a very popular method of fashion dissemination due to the democratization of fashion through the internet.

* Other fashion forums: There are other forums out there. Unfortunately, women’s fashion forums aren’t nearly as far along or developed as men’s. A few off the top of my head are [the Fashion Spot forums](http://forums.thefashionspot.com/), [Purse Forum](http://forum.purseblog.com/), [Superfuture]( http://supertalk.superfuture.com/index.php?/forum/24-superfashion/), and [4chan’s /fa/](http://boards.4chan.org/fa/), the latter two being dominated by mostly males.

* [Lookbook.nu](http://www.lookbook.nu): I’m actually really reluctant to include this site; most of the looks are complete outlandish garbage. However, if you sift through and ignore the most “hyped” looks, you can usually find some decent outfits. You can then keep an eye on those users and look out for any additional outfits they post in the future.

* Other subreddits with more specific interests:

    [/r/fashion](/r/fashion) 

    [/r/FancyFollicles](/r/FancyFollicles) 

    [/r/MakeupAddiction](/r/MakeupAddiction) 

    [/r/RedditLaqueristas](/r/RedditLaqueristas) 

    [/r/Solemates](/r/Solemates)

    [/r/shoes](/r/shoes)

    [/r/shoeporn](/r/shoeporn)


*******

That is pretty much it. Good luck and happy posting!

I'm torn between a couple of dresses and one of the big issues left is having to deal with covering up my tattoo without trying to cover up the dress... or worse... getting a Mother of the Bride dress.

Here's what I'm down to right now: http://i.imgur.com/0SF2swy.png

Part of why I'm just starting to wear clubwear at the age of 27 is because 1) I am a relatively recent transplant to LA where clubbing is a much larger part of the social scene than when I lived in Boston and 2) I've recently lost enough weight to feel comfortable in those short, glittery body con style dresses.

My natural style is more classic/hipster, so I tend to shop at Madewell, J Crew, and maybe Anthropologie. I've been trying since I lost the weight to rebuild my wardrobe with quality pieces, but club wear strikes me as a category that's too trendy to be worth spending a lot on. I have the LBD, but I kind of want to play with bright colors and sparkles too.

Seasoned shoppers of FFA - what's your strategy for buying fun sexy dresses and where do you shop? I know I can probably hit H&amp;M/Forever 21/Modcloth but I'd love some ideas for other options or lesser known websites as well.

**EDIT: Thanks for all the suggestions! The consensus seems to be that it really isn't worth spending a lot on quality club dresses. I guess they kind of fall into the same category as athletic gear when it comes to the French wardrobe philosophy. I'm going to haunt all these sites you've mentioned and pick out two or three dresses for some variety.

I have a solution.,tinyphotographer,72,8,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/tmwzr/ever_get_the_feeling_that_you_have_absolutely/,"I moved from a small town to Toronto in January. Since then, I've been in a style rut. I'd look at my closet and see nothing I wanted to wear. Being a student with very little money, I couldn't go out and buy new stuff so I just threw the same thing on day after day.

Last week, I decided I needed to do a purge of my closet (expecting some money, needed space for new things). I took everything out of my dresser and everything off of hangers and piled them in groups on my dining room table. I sifted through and found the things I absolutely could not get rid off (you know, the things I actually looked good in) as well as things I will need eventually (funeral clothes, formal wear, dance wear, etc...) and I put them back. 

Next, I grabbed a garbage bag and started throwing things in that I knew I would never wear again (old faded and torn things, things I shouldn't have bought, things that just weren't trendy anymore) and I told myself that I could not take anything out of the garbage bag once it was in there. 

After that was done, I was left with a ""maybe"" pile. These were things that I wasn't sure how to wear but still wanted to keep. I moved them to on top of my dresser and left them sitting there. 

The next task was to arrange the clothes in my closet. I began by putting those things that I *really* wanted to wear on hangers and up front so when I went to get dressed I would see them first. After that, I put all my winter clothing in the drawers and gave prime real estate to my spring/summer clothes. Lastly, I sorted the clothes out by kind (skirts first, then dresses, then shirts, then pants). And I was done.

But, you are wondering, what did I do with the ""maybe"" pile? I left it sitting on top of my dresser for a week. If I wanted something from it, and I could prove to myself that I would and could wear it, I would make a spot for it in my closet. By the end of the week, whatever was left of the pile was put in the garbage bag and donated to a thrift store. 

By the end of this, I was left with about 20% of my original wardrobe. I purged a lot. If I had any doubts about an item, I would get rid of it. Most of my clothes fit comfortably into a two foot space in my closet and I actually feel like I have more options now that I have less clothes. I can think of every article of clothing I have and what I can pair it with. When I go shopping, I know exactly what I'm missing and can buy accordingly. I also know, while shopping, what I can pair the item with so I don't have any unwearable items. 

Having less options of clothing makes getting dressed simple. I don't really have to think about it anymore. In the last week, I've had more outfits that I've been happy with than the last four months combined. I plan to do this purge twice a year (spring and fall). And hopefully, I won't have as many of those *i-can't-find-a-damn-thing-to-wear* kind of days.

I wanted to share in case any of you lovely ladies are feeling the same way. The solution isn't to buy more clothes but to get rid of them!

I recently went though my closet and got rid of all the things that I never wear and right now I'm just looking for basic things that every teenager should have. This is a really vague question but how many shirts am I supposed to have, how many pairs of shoes should I have, etc. Also what kind of shirts should I have or shoes should I have, etc. Thanks =3

Edit:

Height: 5'2

Age: 15

Body Type: hourglass

Why?: I always feel like I have nothing to wear and when I do go shopping for clothes and bring them home, I never wear them because I feel like since they're new I should wait for an actual event to wear them

You Now: I'm more of a jeans girl, in fact the only pair of pants I have are dark wash blue jeans and gray jeans. I also have a gray maxi skirt but whenever I wear it, I feel like I'm trying to hard to look nice, (I have a weird attitude towards nice clothes lol) but I love skirts of all kinds and would love to wear them, but whenever I wear them I just feel like I'm trying to hard. I've never had a pair of shorts in my life but I'm open to them. I'm interested in the whole idea of a french wardrobe because i love the idea of mixing and matching basic things but the clothing in the french wardrobe seems to mature for someone my age. I tend to gravitate towards neutral colors and I kind of want to change that because I'm young. But I don't really know what colors I like on me and stuff. I also tend to wan to buy bohemian clothing like Free People, but for some reason I feel like clothes of that style are too hard to mix and match with so I prefer more basic things like a basic t shirt or something.

Budget: I would prefer to buy cheaper things like $15-20 a shirt because I feel bad for my parents but if they love what I pick out they'll spend up to $50 on a shirt.

(Skip past it if you care to. I'm just getting it off my chest.)

I was chatting with a friend this evening about the differences between MFA and FFA (largely how FFA tends to be more accepting because women are accustomed to differing styles and accommodating for body type, etc. whereas most men tend to have to follow a uniform with only slight variations in color, construction and fit).

After a bit of lurking, he surprised me with ""Wow. There is some REALLY low self esteem in FFA,"" and the much more shocking, ""Thank god these women are on the internet not in a bar somewhere.""

I responded with ""They're in a bar, too. It's just that FFA is a safe space to talk about these things, and it would be weird to bring up in a bar."" I then told him how insecure I am about my own body and attacked him with nonsense about how insecurity and self-consciousness is a human prerogative... Despite that initial comment, he was actually really cool about it.

Anyway, I've never considered FFA to be a place with self-esteem issues. It could be that I'm so accustomed to women not feeling comfortable in their own skin that it doesn't faze me, but reading his perception was somewhat jarring to me. I'd assumed when we pointed out our flaws, it was for the benefit of fashion, and so we could communicate to one another what we hope to de/emphasize.

**Actual discussion** 

So, do you feel FFA as a community has self-esteem issues or do you feel we're more accepting of our physical ""shortcomings"" because we're interested in dressing in a way that's flattering to the bodies we have and not the bodies we wished we had?

Earlier in the conversation, I'd linked to [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1cektp/how_has_fashion_positively_impacted_your_views_on/c9fzbwo) by /u/therosenrot in support of the latter option. It could be, however, that I didn't want to acknowledge that we could be broken in some way.

I'm curious:  

* Do you think you have a poor body image?
* Do you perceive the body image of other FFA contributors as poor?
* Does your self-esteem negatively affect how you dress? Are there parts of your body that you try to cover up when others may deem it unnecessary?
* How has fashion influenced your confidence?
* Whatever else... it's late and I'm too tired to coherently think this through. I'll add nearly any questions you suggest.",[Discussion],False,self,t5_2s8o5,1368896134.0,discuss,,True,t3_1ekdio,http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1ekdio/how_does_selfesteem_influence_your/,

What did you buy in the past few months? Was it worth it? Looking back, did you go overbudget, or did you save money? Since this is FFA, I expect there to be a more clothes-centric view, but anything goes. 

Go as far back as you like. It also might be a good way to evaluate how your purchasing patterns have changed. The older the purchase the better, since the ""newness"" and novelty has worn off.

--------
**Item:** *Name/describe the item and, if you found it online, a link to the page. Or, if you're feeling ambitious take a picture of it.*

* *Price paid:* Not exactly absolute cost, but maybe note how much you bought it on sale for

* *Construction:* Describe the quality of the item, what you expected, what you received

* *Etcetera:* How often do you wear it? What kind of hole were you expecting it to fill in your wardrobe? Is it versatile? Was it an item you had thought long and hard about or did you impulse buy?

* *Worth it?* Y/N

Now that it's summer coming up, I'm revising my shorts collection! So, bearing in mind I am a fledging to this world of fashion, I open the floor for critique of all the shorts I own:

I am looking to highlight the two best-looking pairs of shorts from this batch, mostly for summer fun wear; one longer pair might be necessary for work but our dress code is *very* casual so I'm not too worried about it.

1357677040.0,61,self.femalefashionadvice,167az8,Opinions on a set of skirts I made for myself.  ,fiveredhens12,71,10,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/167az8/opinions_on_a_set_of_skirts_i_made_for_myself/,"[Imgur link for those who don't have time to wade through my wall of text](http://imgur.com/a/SJa1d)

I have so many, many thoughts roaming around my head about bodies and fashion and style and clothing.  I have been lurking on this subreddit pretty hard-core for the past few months. I am a 36yo/F/5'6"" currently wearing roughly a US size 8/10 but I have lost 40lbs since last May and hope to lose about 10-15 more and end up *roughly* a US size six (whatever this means).

I have been inspired by so many different sources with regard to both my aesthetic and the ethics of clothing production.  As with many things, my preference is to make it myself.  There are many reasons why this works particularly well for clothing.  I can get a perfect fit and choose just the exact print/fabric that I like.  I know who made it   And, I like engaging in the process of making things.

I have spent so much time over the past year thinking about who I am and the image that I put out into the world.  Part of this starts with what I do.  I am, in order of hours spent engaged in each task, a mother, a farmer, a part-time professor/psychologist, and a wife (meaning that I occasionally need something just right to wear on a date night out with my amazing husband).  I need my wardrobe to meet these needs.  I need to be able to look presentable and professional.  I need to get dressed quickly.  And, I need to have pieces that can mix and match and be worn chasing my kids around a museum and then in front of a lecture-hall filled with young adults.  I also want to look pretty and sophisticated and have a recognizable style.  I want to look like *myself*.  If I had to pick a style icon it would probably be [Charlotte Gainsbourg](http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/search.sets?query=charlotte+gainsbourg).  I like, simple, classic, tailored clothing.  My go-to colors are black, grey, and white with accents of red and yellow.  For home I am often in jeans and a top with a blazer and for work, dresses or separates and a blazer.

I have been in the process of losing weight and as of this moment, I am just shy of having lost 40lbs since May 2012.  I am about 10-15lbs from my goal weight.  I am now the size and shape I was in college, roughly.  I am happy with my body and making these new skirts was a gift I gave to myself to celebrate my progress.  I am building an entirely new wardrobe as I didn't have any clothes that would fit me.  I get most of my things from Goodwill, my local one is amazing and has tons of nice clothing.  I also sew things for myself.

I have also been trying not to buy anything with regards to craft supplies.  I have so much already and sometimes I feel overwhelmed with all that I have.  I worked through a good bit this past week, probably using up 15-20 yards of fabric with these eight skirts.  Next, I plan to make a few dresses for myself before I move on to (gasp!) pants and proper fitted shirts.  It felt great to use up so many fabrics, many of which I have been holding on to until I got a bit smaller.  The vast majority came from a vintage lot that I purchased two years ago from a woman who was a seamstress in the 1960s.  Her fabrics are incredible.   Getting her stash was such a windfall for me.  Her style and mine are almost identical.

[Here is a link to my imgur album with the skirts](http://imgur.com/a/SJa1d).  I would love to get some constructive feedback on the skirts.  I was trying to keep the styling very simple.  I am mostly interested to hear how people think they work as a set.  Are they cohesive?  What am I missing?  I made them to fit my body without wearing shapewear underneath, but when I put them on for the pictures, I did wear some which threw the fit off a bit.  I think I loose 2 inches off my tummy (having several 10lbs babies will make you a bit wobbly in the middle) when I wear support clothing.

There are so many wonderful and charming younger women on here, but I know that there are plenty of other 30-ish professional women lurking around.  A number of them, like me, have lost weight over the past year and are looking to really figure out their style and who they are.  I hope that some of you are willing to come out of the wood-work and let me know what you think.

I can post the info on the specific patterns/fabrics if people are interested.  The skirts with the pockets are from this [McCalls pattern](http://mccallpattern.mccall.com/m6609-products-23002.php?page_id=108).  I have made a few versions of this dress and it is really easy.  The A-line skirts are from the [Built by Wendy book](http://www.amazon.com/Sew-Built-Wendy-Making-Wardrobe/dp/0821257404/ref=pd_sim_b_1).  The other skirts were ones I self-drafted.

Bomber jackets first appeared around WW1 and WW2 and were meant to keep the pilots warm in their uninsulated aircrafts. Bomber jackets became popularized again in the 1990s after movies such as [Top Gun](http://static1.celebrityredcarpet.co.uk/articles/0/10/30/@/3647-kelly-mcgillis-and-tom-cruise-starred-500x0-2.jpg), which made the bomber jacket into a symbol of honor, adventure and style. Additionally, bomber jackets have been popular in various subcultures such as with [skinheads](http://vancouversharp.webs.com/RM20LJ20DM20RP.jpg) and also with certain [hip hop or rap groups](http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/_/118376/RunDMC.jpg)

Varsity jackets are typically worn by varsity students who are part of the athletic program in their high school or college. Wearing a varsity jacket reminds me of those high school days where you might wear an oversized letterman jacket to cheer on your school's football team.  

To me, wearing either of these jackets easily adds just the right amount of sporty-cool-casual to an outfit and there are so many creative ways to wear them. These jackets are pretty easily attainable nowadays, but be careful which ones you buy since it can be easy for them to look too flashy or cheap.

Anyway, I'm not very good at writing things about fashion but enjoy!

What do you think?,plastic_apollo,72,7,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/ygjc6/teacher_update_i_bought_3_new_outfits_based_on/,"Hi again everyone! Thank you again for the advice you all gave me in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/yeppy/how_to_not_look_like_a_sexy_teacher_or_my/), which was both practical and broadening in terms of looking at the situation from different viewpoints while still offering excellent tips on keeping it professional while toning down sex appeal but not turning frumpy. 

I took your advice and bought three new outfits today! Predictably, all of the ensembles came from the places I said I like to shop at: Anne Taylor, Banana Republic, and White House Black Market. I mentioned that I also liked Express, but you all helpfully pointed out that those business pieces that I've been buying there are a bit too sexy, so I followed your instructions and steered clear. I DID try J. Crew, but I have yet to find a single piece of anything in that store that I like. (Although, I did try on a pair of red pants because of how much I loved this user's outfit from [this post](www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/y0s9f/red_trousers_appropriate_for_a_business_casual/), but no dice).

Here are my new outfits (I tried to get a range of styles). Please tell me your thoughts! As always, sorry for the terrible lighting and photos-in-a-mirror. **Oh, and if anything sticks out to you as god awful, let me know. I've got all the receipts and the tags are still attached.**

**1. Black and white patterned skirt: Anne Taylor. Black cami, purple cardigan: Black House White Market.** Okay, so I took your advice....**I broke down and bought a cardigan.** The skirt hits at the knee and the cardigan buttons up completely, but I'm not sure if I like it better unbuttoned or buttoned up. [Outfit Number 1!](http://i.imgur.com/sVATU.jpg). Please let me know your thoughts on which you prefer and the outfit as a whole.

**2. Dress: WHBM.** Okay, this is cheating, since it's just a dress. I had posted a link to a similar dress like one I own from Banana Republic because I was worried it wasn't appropriate, but a ton of you said it was. So....I got another dress! (I love dresses). This one keeps my arms bare (gasp...) so I know I need to cover up somehow, but I couldn't find a way to do so without making it seem frumpy. I tried a few different blazers (black) but that made it too heavy on black - I'm thinking some color (**....maybe even a second cardigan?**) might do it, but I'm not sure. Your thoughts greatly appreciated! Or, do you think it's even okay to keep my whole arms bare? [Outfit No. 2](http://i.imgur.com/e6hQb.jpg).

**3. Pants: WHBM. Blouse, scarf: Anne Taylor:** A few of you made the point that those skirts from Express (....and I own a few...) have a slit that goes a little too high, etc. and suggested that slacks of some sort were a more appropriate angle than a skirt suit. One user also pointed out that it's appropriate to look at what your co-workers are wearing, so I wanted to get an outfit a little more casual (certainly as compared to the dress) but still clean...I might have swung too far casual, but I'm not sure. I love wearing white with a bright color, so I got white slacks and a yellow, above-the-cleavage-line scoop neck blouse....**and then I saw the scarf.** I have a terrible weakness for scarves. **I am ashamed of myself for how much I paid for that scarf, but I'm sorry, FFA. I had to.** 

There's two pictures for this, because I had the most questions about it. During the first picture, my 10-week-old puppy was pissed I was taking so long and decided to attack the heels I was wearing for the picture, so you get an awkward, lifting-my-leg-to-prevent-the-puppy-attack picture. For this one, **I tucked the shirt in, paired it with a belt, styled the scarf as an infinity, and wore nude heels to match the belt.** For the second photo, the puppy was placated, so I changed things up. **The shirt is untucked, the scarf is being worn down as a faux-tie, and the heels are red.** Which look do you prefer? [Outfit 3.](http://i.imgur.com/2JP1H.jpg).

OKAY, that's a long post! Thank you all again for posting yesterday to help me out! Hopefully I've done right by you guys and picked out 3 better outfits that are still fashionable and not frumpy. Thanks again for any more thoughts you have to offer! 

**PS: I was talking to the employees at White House Black Market, and during our convo I said I was hunting for clothes appropriate for teaching. Apparently, teachers automatically get 15% off their entire purchase EVERY TIME THEY SHOP. I had NO idea, and I've been shopping there forever. It's not something they advertise, I suppose.

 I was told that the pants were a big no go. I needed to find a high waist and straight leg as it would (hopefully) make my hips appear smaller.

Just found this sub earlier this week and hoping you ladies (and gents perhaps?) can help me out. My beautiful baby boy is 2 months old and I am at a loss as to what to wear now. I really want to feel good about myself and I feel like I look decent.

Pre-pregnancy: Size 4-6 depending on the retailer, 5' 3"", 130 lbs, 34B bra, fair bit of muscle as I was/am a runner and triathlete

Now: Enorma-boobs, no waist to speak of, persistent tummy pooch that renders most of my former clothes ill-fitting. Yes, I can fit into my old clothes now, but I always had a nice stomach, so I have a lot of things that are tighter in that area that now look...bad. 
Measurements now:
Bust- 39""
Underbust- 32.5""
Waist (such as it is)- 33""
Hips- 40""
Inseam- 29""

Now, the body-type determiner website says this makes me an ""hourglass"" shape...maybe. But all the suggestions for hourglass shapes say to play up my waist, which is the last thing I want to do!

Sooooooo....I'm looking for advice on general styles or specific pieces that would be good for the summer months. Ideally, I'd like to be able to get 5-10 ""staple"" pieces that I can mix and match and accessorize so I don't end up spending too much money (I'd like to spend $350 max).

My primary concerns are: 
1) Being able to nurse. So any dress has to be able to be pulled to the side to expose a boob. Shirts are fine because you can pull them up if needed. 
2) Disguising the stomach pooch. Not bragging, but as I mentioned above, I've always had a flat stomach, so I'm utterly un-used to shopping with this in mind.
3) No shorts. Never been a fan of my thighs (big and muscular...thanks, running!), and I'm quite sure pregnancy has not improved them!

I did a search for ""baby"" and ""postpartum"" fashion, but I didn't find much, and nothing for summer. So if I'm breaking any rules about posting, I apologize. Please let me know and I'll add/remove anything I need to. Thank you!

Edit: Things I *do* like about myself/my body: 
1) I have a good upper body- back/shoulders/arms and have no problem playing that up
2) I have blue eyes so the color blue in all shades usually looks good
3) I've always had an ass that won't quit, and luckily pregnancy and childbirth didn't change that!

I left out most of the filler content.    

I typed all these out for my own sake, but decided it would be beneficial to everyone.     

**The Cotton Care Guide**    

*Cotton: Know your Terms*    

**Broadcloth:** tightly woven and luxurious, it resembles poplin (see below).  Used primarily in **men's and women's shirts**.      
**Chambray**: plain weave with repeating **one white and one color yarns**.  Work cloths, denim dresses, and sports wear.    
**Chenille: Fuzzy yarn** with pile protruding from it.  Sweaters, fun scarves and throws.    
**Corduroy: Ribbed, pile fabric.**  Great for kid's pants, lightweight version is popular for juniors.    
**Denim: Rugged twill**. Think of jeans and jackets.      
**Jersey: Lightweight knit** that drapes and washes well. T-shirts, lightweight dresses and skirts.    
**Oxford: Plain, pinpoint and basket weave shirting fabrics.** Most popular in button-down shirts.    
**Poplin: Finely ribbed**, but barely noticeable. In shirts, little girl's dresses and sheets.    
**Stonewash**: Garments that are industrially laundered with pumice stones for a shot, faded look.    
**Twill**: Versatile fabric identified by diagonal lines. Very recognizable in denim and khaki pants.    
**Velvet**: Fabric with a soft, rich texture created by **densely woven, cut pile**. Great look for the holidays.                


*Selecting Your Sheets: A Guide*    

Thread count is a number of single yarns in a square inch of fabric: 180 up to 800 or more.  It affects the crispness or touch of a sheet, and is a personal choice.  It's all about what feels best against your skin.          

Cotton sheets release soil easily so they can watch clean.        

Wrinkle-resistant cotton sheets can go straight from dryer to bed.  Fabric finishing technology creates a lasting memory for a smooth, flat appearance. Look for easy care finish.        
         
*Cotton Sheet Glossary*        

**Combed Cotton:** a process that removes the shorter fibers from the yarn for a cleaner, more lustrous look.    
**Mercerized Cotton:** finishing process for stronger, and more lustrous yarn that takes dye better permitting brighter, deeper colors.    
**Flannel:** plain weave cloth heavily brushed for warmth.    
**Jersey:** plain stitch knit.  Think of your favorite T-shirts.    
**Percale:** smooth finally called woven sheeting fabric.  Minimum 180 thread count.    
**Sateen:** satin-weave fabric with a smooth lustrous surface.            



*Tips for neat sheets*    

Rotate the sheet sets to prolong their life by observing the ""rule of three"": one set of sheets on the bed, one in the laundry, and one in the linen closet.    

Wash sheets before using them for the first time.    

Cotton releases soil easily, so sheet so wash really clean and smell fresh.  Softness increases with a laundering.    

New Wrinkle-resistant Technology lets sheets go from dryer to bed looking smooth and flat.       

Don't over dry, which can set wrinkles and fade colors. Fold while warm.    

Never store sheets in unfinished wood and drawers or shelves, which can stain fabric over time.    

Keep it simple: stack linens of same type (flat, fitted, pillowcases) and size together, or in sets.        


*Cotton, in other words*    

**Chintz:** Glazed, often printed cotton fabric.    
**Duck:** Rugged, durable plain weave canvas.    
**Flannel**: plain weave with soft, brushed surface.    
**Gingham**: Fabric with checkered pattern, typically in a white and another color.    
**Jacquard**: elaborate damask, brocade and tapstry fabrics create a special loom producing a decorative design.    
**Matelasse**: Dobby or jacquard with a quilted look.    
**Percale**: Smooth, finely combed woven sheeting.  Minimum 180 thread count.    
**Sateen**: a smooth,lustrous, satiny surface, sometimes with a woven stripe.    
**Seersucker**: Light-weight fabric of which has crinkle effect.    
**Terry cloth**: moisture-absorbing soft fabric with loop pile on one or both sides.    
**Velour**: woven in loops to form a pile. Loops are sheered to add luster.    
**Voile:** sheer, plain-weave fabric that has a crisp feel.        

**All of The cotton care guide**        

*The Knack of Caring for Knits*        

Many cotton sweaters and knits are washable, if dry cleaning is not your thing.  So check your labels to be absolutely sure before you make a purchase.    

To retain shape and fit, tumble dry cotton knits for no more than 5 minutes, then hang dry unless otherwise indicated on care label.    

It's often best to try a sweater flat, laying it out on a towel.    

Roll cotton knit sweaters and tees when you pack to prevent wrinkles.    

Put jewelry on after you put on knits to avoid pulling yarns.    

Dry subject: how to buy towels    

Cotton is extra absorbent, unlike any other fibers.    

Opt for 100% cotton high quality carrying with thick, tightly woven loops.    

The thicker the loops, the more yarn they contain, so they dry better.    

*Select a style to suit yours:*        

**Terry**: Woven on a loom which utilizes an additional yarn to form loops normal called ""pile"" or ""loop surfaces"".    
**Velour**: Like terry, but with its loops sheared to a shorter length on one side.  
Some prefer the decorative sheen that results. Terry should face the skin for optimum drying.    
**Printed**: colorful designs are printed on the surface of both terry or velour towels.    
**Jacquard**: features of decorative area of slightly up raised yarns, which are woven into the towel.    
**Embellished**: to add a decorative flair to a bathroom, some manufacturers add embroidery or trim to a towel.        


*Simple towel care*        

Wash towels on their own to avoid linting clothes or damaging towels with zips, hooks or buttons.    

Separate deep colors from lights.    

Follow instructions on care labels to avoid shrinkage.    

Mild detergent is a must and go light on the chlorine bleach; it weakens fibers.    

Using half of the recommended amount of detergent keeps towels soft.    

Never pour detergent directly on towels.    

Tumble dry, but don't overdo it.    

It's hanging to dry, shake the towel while still wet and again after drying to fluff terry loops.    

Don't use silicone-based fabric softeners, which leave behind a waxy film.    

A properly care for, quality towel can last up to 10 years.        


*Say goodbye to Stains:*        

Don't wait! Treat spots right away - and repeat before drying if stain is still visible.    

For basic stain removal, try seltzer, water or ice.  Grass: soak for 30 minutes in liquid detergent with water, then run through a normal wash cycle.  The grass is gone.    

**Fruit juice:** sell for 30 minutes in 1 quart of warm water and 1 teaspoon of stain remover, then longer immediately.    

**Lipstick**: apply stain remover and warm water, then launder.  No incriminating evidence.    

**Ink**: Apply rubbing alcohol and liquid detergent, then rub together. Run through a a normal wash cycle and the ink should be gone.    

**Makeup on your pillow case**: Rub a bar of soap on the stain until it disappears, then launder.    

**Pizza sauce**: saturated with spot remover for food stains.  For stubborn stains, rubbed with heavy duty liquid detergent.  Launder immediately.
    
**Coffee**: soak in 30 minutes in stain remover and warm water, then run through a normal wash.        


**The Cotton Shopping Guide**        

*Shirt Savvy*    

To keep white shirts white, treat underarm stains with fresh lemon juice.  So for 1/2 hour, machine wash with detergent and chlorine bleach.  Important: always check their care label before laundering.  The more a share is washed, the softer it will feel. Iron with starch for a crisper look.    

Wrinkle-resistant cotton shirts are a great choice.  Remove from dryer, shake vigorously, and you're good to go.    

Place permanent press shirts on a non rust hangers while slightly damp from the dryer.    

Shares with shoulder pads or delicate embellishments should be professionally cleaned.    


*Ten essentials for every guy*        
1.  Begin with a blazer or tailored jacket in cotton cord or canvas.    
2.  At a tailored cotton pant.  Crisp chinos are flattering to most body parts.    
3.  Grab a great woven shirt and a solid, or add a lively to the lineup.    
4.  A bright polo is a must have.    
5.  Opt for a terrific pair of denim jeans that fit well, in your favorite style and wash.
6.  Make a statement with a printed tee shirt.    
7.  At cotton cargo pant for a sporty mix.    
8.  Find the perfect, mid-weight cotton T and a solid.

I think it'd be really helpful to beginners, plus it will really bring the idea full circle. Here are some topics I think would be really great to cover:

* Judging the quality of an item in store (stitching, fabric, how to know if a hanging thread is coming out or is just extra length that doesn't affect quality, etc).
* Judging the quality of an item online when you can't really see it.
* Different materials, warnings on care for them, and what they should cost
* The value of an item based on the judged quality, price, care costs, materials, and maybe even cost-per-wear.
* How to tell when a high price tag is coming mostly from a brand name and not quality

I think the emphasis should not be 100% on the idea of quality as durability or how long the item will last, which FFA and MFA and these French wardrobe type approaches can get stuck on very often. Clothes should last more than one season but realistically most people aren't buying them to keep wearing for fifty years. But--better made, nicer clothes look noticeably better  (think of how you never see celebrities in forever 21 clothes) and that is more important to a lot of people and still ties in to these same concepts. (Of course how it wears is still important...looking high-quality and lasting longer often come together, and nobody wants to spend on something that'll fall apart instantaneously).",,False,self,t5_2s8o5,False,,,True,t3_165lje,http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/165lje/can_we_have_a_guide_to_judging_quality_value_and/,

**Edit**: Thanks to /u/slaughterhouse-six, I now know I need to post more information. :)


* Height- 5'1""


* Age- 15


* Body type- I don't...know. I've looked at this before but nothing looks quite right. I carry the most of my weight in my lower tummy, I think. (This is because when I began regaining weight, my organs needed protection the most, and the weight got distributed there first and most generously. At least, that's what my doctor says). My bust is on the small side, 32B. I'm generally pretty petite, small arms and legs. Just my stomach looks distended, if that makes sense.


* Why- I'd like to look cute for school next year. I've always been conscious of how I look, but I don't really look fashionable.


* Me now- In the winter I live in jeans and peacoats. Summer it's just tanktops and shorts. I do most of my shopping at Anthropologie, Urban Outfitters, thrift shops, Target (gotta love it), and Free People. I think I really enjoy the style of clothing at Anthropologie the most. I always wear glasses (bad eyesight) and they look kind of like [this](http://www.opticsplanet.com/vogue-vo2740-single-vision-prescription-eyeglasses.html) is solid black. I've had people call me ""hipster"" but honestly I don't know how appilcable that is. 


* Budget- My rule has always been that I would rather buy an expensive article of clothing that will last forever than buy cheap clothes that get ruined in the wash and need replacing in a week. But, nothing too expensive, please. I shop at Anthropolgie, but mostly their clearance. That might give you an idea of my budget. I pay for all my own clothing.

I'm young (25) and pear-shaped. My measurements are as follows:

Bustline: 32.5
Waist: 26.5
Hips: 36

I'm 5'00'' and 110 lbs. Currently I teach at a university, but I'm getting my license to teach at public high schools in the US, which I'll begin doing in the spring (this is my last fall as a college instructor). 

I've had students write on feedback (that goes to the department! ACK!) that I am ""super sexy"" and ""hot!"" multiple times now. So, that was kinda great, because....yay? Definitely makes me feel better about myself (I tend to feel self conscious), but I have a problem: I don't want my future high school students (read: hormone addled teenage boys) having the hots for teacher (even if it's just going to happen anyways because they're hormone addled teenage boys).

I was in a sorority, so I tend to dress in that prep/business casual way: floral prints skirts paired with blazers and heels, that sort of thing. I like to shop at Express (not the clubbing section, the business section), Banana Republic, and White House Black Market the most.

I'm doing a big shopping day tomorrow and was hoping you all could suggest either some stores or some styles that I could wear. I was thinking about J. Crew, but I'm not a fan of any of their stuff. I don't want to look frumpy and I don't mind casual - I like fitted clothes, I LIKE looking (or at least THINKING that I look) nice. Is there no way around this? I'm both amused, happy, confused, and horrified. 

One last note: On Sept. 1 I'm donating 14.5 inches of hair, so I'll have VERY short hair for the first time in my life (I'm donating to Children With Hair Loss, before anyone starts posting about Locks of Love). Are there specific styles that look good for people with short hair?

**tl/dr: Feeling totally lost, need to change up my style because apparently my adult students think I'm sexy and I'm about to start teaching teenagers. This is a problem as I was not trying to be sexy to begin with and frankly makes me slightly uncomfortable. Need to know what stores/styles I should aim for, as am going shopping tomorrow. All help appreciated!** 

**UPDATE: Thank you to everyone for your advice! In addition to selecting certain styles/ways of dressing (pants instead of skirt suits, always keep a cardigan handy, get over it and try J. Crew, etc.) I really appreciate the practical advice you had to offer as well regarding how students will perceive me, regardless of what I wear. Thank you also for understanding that I wasn't trying to be conceited with this post - I'm genuinely puzzled that my students find me attractive! In any event, if I buy something I'm really excited about, I'll post some pictures later and you can tell me how I did.

So the new school year's coming up, and I've had conflicting issues on the bag I want to get to use. It seems others have been having this issue you as well, so let's get it started!

Here's what I've found so far.

* [Jansport.](http://www.jansport.com/js_home.php?cfid=710346621) Jansport is really the monopoly for back to school bags: high quality bags at a low end price, and you can get them almost anywhere. However, they're somewhat unfashionable or plain, so if you're willing to sacrifice that, then it's a good decision to get it in a solid color.

* [L.L. Bean.](http://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/816?nav=gnro-916) L.L. Bean makes backpacks similar to those you can find at Jansport, as well as absolutely amazing rucksacks. Their quality has always been considered good, they make solid bags that last awhile. However, they're definitely more on the high end of the price spectrum.

* [Herschel.](http://shop.herschelsupply.com/shop/backpack.html) Herschel is famous for their handsomely designed backpacks and rucksacks, but also poor quality. The stitching isn't too good, and some of the ones that aren't compeltely canvas can rip easily. However, they're in the medium price range, and good for about a year.

* [Fjällräven.](http://www.fjallraven.us/lp-18-bags.aspx) These certainly leave behind a reputation. They're high quality, good looking bags in several different styles that range from modern to vintage. On the much higher end of the price spectrum, but probably lasting for several years.

Here's some of my favorite esoteric brands:

* [Ecote.](http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/catalog/search.jsp?q=ecote+backpacks) Ecote is an Urban Outfitters brand, and they make *awesome* bags. I currently own an out of print Indian Blanket knapsack that I can not leave the house without. Lots of patterns, styles, and sizes for what you need - make sure to check the dimensions, because some can be as large as a Jansport or couldn't work for school at all, like my rucksack. They show wear, but last long.

* [Canada Roots.](http://canada.roots.com/men_backpacks_and_nylon_bags/mensBagsAndBackpacks,default,sc.html) These bags are lovely. One hundred percent leather, made in Canada. They have some kickass rucksack designs and really good vintage camping inspired styles as well. Middle price range, great quality. I'd love to have one.

* [Kelty Camping.](http://www.kelty.com/c-backpacks.aspx) I have to admit, these are the ones I like the best. While Kelty makes hiking packs, they also have a series of beautiful vintage inspired backpacks and rucksacks that make me dream of packing up and running off with Sam Shakusky. Pretty well priced, and the quality seems solid.


Here's another great post on this subject in [r/TeenMFA.](http://www.reddit.com/r/TeenMFA/comments/xmbpe/backpacks/)

Also - don't be afraid to thrift and use what your family has to offer. That's how you can get some of the highest quality stuff at a lower end price.

Please feel free to add! This is good stuff, guys. Brands, your own bags, quality of the product, price points, anything you want to add or can think of.

So if anyone who owns a backless bra could take the time to fill out this survey I'd really appreciate it! 

You will need a soft measuring tape or a string and a ruler should you decide to fill the survey out. The survey is open to anyone of any bra size and the backless bra doesn't have to fit in order to fill out the survey so long as you can give information about the fit issues you had with it and the brand, name, and size of the bra you were using. If the bra fits it would be great to hear from you too! I'm trying to gather information for both good fits and bad fits. I'm hoping that by gathering this data it will be easier for others to figure out what size they would need in a backless bra and to figure out the range of bra sizes that they fit.

**(Description stolen from the original [WSWT](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/search?q=wshewt&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on) threads**)

What to do: Here we want you to post a look or item you saw someone else wear. It can be from a lookbook, from a blog, from a pic you snapped on the street (with permission), hell even from an ad on the side of a bus. Something you saw on someone else and liked and want to discuss further.


Rules for posting an inspiration photo:

* Only 1 photo per post, you can post as many as you want

* DO NOT LINK TO PIC DIRECTLY! Please rehost all images to IMGUR.
* No self shots/blogspam
* Include at least a 3 item critique on why you think this outfit works well. Here are some suggested categories you can comment on to get you started:

1. color coordination
2. fit
3. silhouette
4. accessories
5. execution/overall “feel”


The rules are in place to encourage discussion on why you think the outfit works well. Consider it an exercise on critiquing and how to put together an outfit, not just mindless posting of pretty pictures.

1361341458.0,58,self.femalefashionadvice,18vfub,I'm 26. I collect band shirts. Please help me figure out how I can wear them without looking like I'm a teenager who hates their parents. ,leahlionheart,64,6,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/18vfub/im_26_i_collect_band_shirts_please_help_me_figure/,"The title really says it all. I'm 26, a graduate student, and able to dress fairly casually for work and academic obligations. I collect unusual and hard-to-find shirts for bands and various arts or political movements. Most are black and men's cut. However, I'm trying to update my style to be more 'adult' but still maintain a bold alternative style without looking juvenile.   

I've thought about wearing them with shorts + tights + boots, but after that, I'm at a loss. **Please help!**

Usually I pair them with skinny black jeans and 14 eyelet docs. I'd like to start having them altered to fit my body better (narrower in the waist, shorter sleeves) and give them a more feminine cut; a project I'm able to do on my own with a sewing machine.   

  
My personal style (not to be confused with ""fashion"") is primarily dark (black, dark red, dark grey, olive green) colors with a slant towards 'alternative' fashion (i.e., sartorial inspiration is primarily from like, The Fifth Element, Hackers (no, for srs), 1984's vision of the future, etc; not super stylized, but fairly unconventional/gritty/dark/etc - especially being in Indiana); I try to be pretty tongue-in-cheek and occasionally over-the-top.   I've got very short, nearly-white blonde hair, and love doing my hair and makeup every day.   
  
**EDIT**: There's been some awesome guidance here. I think what was missed though, is that I'm not really trying to 'look more feminine' or change my essential inclinations towards darker/alt fashion. I'm trying to make the look more adult and boldly stylized while still preserving an industrial/punky look.",,False,self,t5_2s8o5,1361386788.0,,,True,t3_18vfub,http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/18vfub/im_26_i_collect_band_shirts_please_help_me_figure/,

I used to have my stuff organized by color within several categories: dresses, t-shirts, camisoles, sweaters, then kind of everything else. However, I was hanging things up, I realized a lot of my neutral-colored items looked really nice together. So now I'm considering hanging up all of my neutrals together as a wardrobe foundation and organizing everything with color by other some kind of logic as accent pieces (keeping t-shirts and dresses still separate).

What do you all do? What works and what doesn't?

I've recently gotten interested in the idea of a french or capsule wardrobe--I've searched FFA and seen it discussed here a fair amount.  Sorry in advance if my post is ranty... I just am getting so frustrated with my inability to make decisions!

I've been reading this site:  http://into-mind.com/2013/01/06/10-step-wardrobe-revamp/ --and absolutely loving it for its simplicity.  However, I'm really hung up on the step where you define a personal style or come up with a day to day work ""uniform.""  I really, really want a ""uniform"" because I'm tired of worrying over what to wear every day and never quite feeling like myself.  I feel like I'd really enjoy a structured, simple process where I don't have to think/analyze every day so I can have confidence that I look good.

One problem I'm encountering is that, if it were up to me, I'd just wear comfortable stuff all the time.  In the past I've had two completely different styles, one for work and one for home, and the work style has never felt like me--it feels like the costume of a more serious, awkward, boring person.  I realize I'll always have two separate sets of clothing for ""work"" and ""home"" because I just don't like dressing professionally that much, but it would be nice if I could at least find a way to make my work wardrobe feel more like me.  In the past, ""work style"" has meant whatever slacks or dark jeans I had that fit and any blouses I had and sometimes a cardigan (can you feel my enthusiasm here?)  Sometimes in winter I do sweater dresses and tights, and in summer I wear skirts and blouses.  This past year, I was sneaking things into my work wardrobe that I probably shouldn't even wear to work and trying to dress them ""up"" (bright colored skinny jeans, yoga skirts... things that I actually feel comfortable in).  I am sick of feeling sloppy and worrying that I don't look work-appropriate.  The first thing I do when I get home is take off my work clothes... I have often even had things I wanted to do ""out and about"" near work, but came home because I couldn't stand to spend another minute feeling awkward and weird in my work clothes.  I don't want to be aware that I'm wearing work clothes every minute I'm wearing them any more.

So, I want to make sure I buy things I like.  That's why it feels so important to me to actually find a sense of ""style"" and a uniform look I can wear to work easily and not hate or feel fake/oppressed by what I'm wearing.

I read the sidebar guide to defining a personal style, but reading fashion blogs just makes me go blank from feeling overwhelmed because I'm not really SURE what I like, and I've tried taking some style quizzes but they always have questions about which celebs you admire and I know NOTHING about celebrities :(  It feels like there's this massive learning curve that involves browsing blogs for a really long time while trying to pick things I like when I'm not sure what I like, and learning about celebs, just to help me decide what my own style is.  Is there an easier way to circumvent all of this research?  Does anyone know of an alternative approach to defining a personal style or choosing a ""uniform"" for a day to day look?

The quizzes I've taken online always put me in the creative, bohemian, or romantic categories.  I'm not sure how to translate any of these things into ""professional,"" though.  I work in a vaguely creative field but still need to look put-together.  I like rich, bright colors and interesting prints.  And I like anything unique, really, and I admire people who take fashion risks--which is probably why dressing business casual has made me feel like a fake in the past.  I do also envy people who look all tidy in pencil skirts and blazers with skinny pants and sheath dresses and etc but I always feel weird when I try those things on (with blazers, it may be a fit issue though because I have broad shoulders and can never get them to lay flat across my chest when buttoned).  Is that something I'll get past with time?

If it helps, I'm 31, but I've been in graduate school for what feels like 1000 years, so I've never really learned how to look for a ""grown up"" job (nor have I had the money to do so). 

How did you settle on YOUR personal style?  What is your daily work ""uniform"" like?

* Is this the coward's way out? Should I just be slogging it to as many stores as I can to try on as many things as I can and try to figure this out on my own with the occasional help of FFA? Or is it ok to get help from someone like this?

* Has anyone actually used a stylist at Nordstroms? Do they give quality advice? Is there a large chance they could be only moderately more knowledgeable than myself, and convince me the outlandish expensive outfits they're trussing me up in are stylish when they're really not? Do they work on commission?

Though they'll still be active on Reddit, they'll no longer be serving as moderators. We'd like to thank them very much for all they've done! 

Secondly, we would like to thank all of those who submitted applications to serve as moderators - we had more applications than slots to fill, and we were truly impressed with the thought each of you had put into your answers. Though we could not select all of you, this community is truly lucky to have so many passionate contributors who are invested in the success of the subreddit. If you applied and were not selected, please do not be discouraged; as the community grows (we're almost at 40,000 subscribers - we only had 14,000 this time one year ago!) there will be more opportunities for moderatorship and we will likely employ this procedure again.

We selected our four new moderators along several criteria - length and level of involvement with the FFA community, demonstrated ability to give good advice, past moderating experience, philosophy of the role of a moderator in FFA and Reddit in general, and ability to mesh and work well with the existing moderating team. Please join me in congratulating your new ~~overlords~~ moderators:

I am 5'3"" ~145lbs and am currently having to use a wheelchair and I'm an amputee. 

The new job is casual, but I am the office admin so I'd like to stay a little more on the professional side of business casual. I'm also looking to move up in the company/life so any tips for my style are appreciated!

Here are some ideas I had [imgur album of webcam shots](http://imgur.com/a/LK8uw). They are pretty typical of what I like to wear. My vote is for outfit 4.

I'd also like to present a discussion topic on how to dress if you're going to be using a wheelchair OR sitting a lot in general. Are there specific outfits that are simply more flattering when sitting? I have always strayed away from tighter stuff, because when you sit you scrunch down and your fat gets accentuated. I also depend more on the cut of the clothes, rather than gravity/body shape to do the silhouette. Loose /flowy items like [this](http://image.made-in-china.com/2f0j00ceJTKlACwFbQ/Popular-Ladies-Fashion-Top-SC0008-.jpg) don't work when sitting.

First post here, so I apologise if I'm doing this wrong. I bought a couple of [these](http://imgur.com/MDCMjFn) basic skirts from H&amp;M a few months ago in black &amp; green. I wore the black one with tights a while ago and I don't remember having any problems with it. However, I wore the green one a couple of days ago with nothing underneath and I had a massive issue with it riding up - I was constantly pulling it down and I felt like an idiot.

I read a couple of threads and googled it and it seems that if I wear something underneath it should stop it from riding up. Also, it's riding up from the bottom of the skirt, not at the waist. It seems that cotton would work, so I had a look on ebay and found [these](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Hot-Women-Safety-Lace-Shorts-Leggings-Pants-Black-White-/280702938898?pt=UK_Women_s_Shorts&amp;var=&amp;hash=item415b32ef12).

My style has greatly changed since then, which I do credit to being able to buy clothes on my own finally, and though I'm still editing and revising that style I've accumulated a ton of clothes that I also no longer wear (if you sub to the ThriftyThread and WardrobePurge subreddits you might've seen me pawning off some of my clothes). I'm getting sick of the build-up of unwanted items and the constant spending and consuming, but it's hard to stop, and all efforts so far have failed as I will inevitably find a new item to vy for, when I probably have enough in my closet, with a couple exceptions. It even stresses out my boyfriend.

Ironically I'm very attracted to the idea of the French wardrobe, but as it is I won't be able to achieve that until I have a better idea of what kinds of things I will actually wear after admiring it on screen or in store. I also currently don't really have the budget to spend hundreds of dollars on each high-quality basic, not to mention how afraid I'd be to ruin or stain it, considering I'll be a Painting major next year.

Basically, I am a shy, awkward, super dorky-looking 26 year old girl who is trying to use the summer to fix herself.  I've spent nearly my whole life hiding in hoodies, ponytails, and being made fun of for my appearance.  I think part of the reason why I put so little effort into this part of myself is because I have some low self-esteem issues, and I always thought that I would be sort of hideous no matter what I tried to do.

I've been told that I look a lot like Charlyne Yi.  See her pictures here: http://imgur.com/NWoWscN
http://imgur.com/wNja43X
I think the only real differences between me and her are my race (I am of Indian descent, so I have a bigger nose than her), and that I have weird-looking legs (super huge calves).

What kind of clothes would even look good on me?  I have never worn makeup, so I don't even know where to start with that.  And hair... aaaahhhh, what to do with my hair?  Anytime I wear it down, it just looks so frizzy and boring.  I wish I could look like some super cool lady like.. Solange, or MIA, or Alison Mosshart, or someone, but that is probably a crazy longshot.

Thanks for reading.

The problem is, my current job doesn't pay very well (this new job would be a real, actual professional job again, and my current salary would almost double!)  So at this time I only own one suit that fits me, and it's the one I just wore yesterday.  It's navy blue, and it's your fairly standard run-of-the-mill pants suit I got at The Limited.

If I get a second interview, should I be wearing a completely different suit?  Am I expected to go drop another $200+ just to put on something in a different color?  Or is it ok to just change the top I wore under it and repeat the same suit?  

For a little context, it's for a job at a college (so maybe a bit more liberal than a super-businessy environment).  For the second interview I think I would encounter some of the same people that I did at the first, but they said I'd be doing the actual interviewing with people who are higher-ranking.

I just want to be prepared in case I do get another interview.  What do I do?

Also, if I CAN repeat the same suit, what colors would be ok for the top under it?  Does it need to be a neutral color and not a pattern?

Cultural appropriation?,dwindling,68,15,158,http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/19w1yy/discussion_incorporating_oldtraditional_looks_yay/,"So, today a friend of mine (a guy) was wearing a tea green Chinese-style taichi sort of button up and a moderately puffy black jacket over it. It looked fantastic. I cried it was so nicely done. 

**And this led me to wonder: what are some old/traditional styles you want to see mixed in with casual wear? Or incorporated into new design?**

I'm talking about any sort of traditional style. (By the way, when did we [stop that heavy embroidery thing?](http://i.imgur.com/LsL5MuN.jpg) Part of me thinks that [we shouldn't have.)](http://i.imgur.com/SQJTO0P.jpg) Do you have any old Serbian or Argentinian traditional clothing lying around that you're now thinking of plundering?

Do you even [Yulia Tymoshenko?](http://i.imgur.com/IpqefgF.jpg)

I have a friend with Scottish roots who has a family plaid that she likes to wear as scarves and headbands.

Or, what about incorporating old styles into new clothing? I found the [Hijabi evening wear featured in this NPR article](http://www.npr.org/internedition/fall11/?p=33) very [beautiful.](http://i.imgur.com/6haKXl2.jpg) Or, I recently stumbled across [this brand](http://www.shanghaitang.com/shop/lookbook-women-ss13.html) which is focused on designing with old Chinese styles in mind. [Here are some images I pulled from their most recent lookbook.](http://imgur.com/a/XyKyo)

At the same time, some people might wonder: [""Isn't this cultural appropriation?""](http://i.imgur.com/k90LhsA.gif) I don't like that term, but I do think it's a valid question to be asked. I think I should mention that my earlier friend is white. I am Chinese-American. I don't aim to speak for anyone but myself, but you know there's a stereotype in China of the ""Chinese culture obsessed white guy"" who wears those tang collared shirts with knot buttons and is just weird and creepy. [(It's not the most PC stereotype.)](http://i.imgur.com/rSQHk.gif) At the same time, I don't believe my friend in wearing that shirt is not being any of those things. I think there's a difference between wearing something in a kitschy/fetishistic manner versus as a stylistic choice. 

I don't know, maybe you think that's even worse: [plundering people's culture and only for style.](http://i.imgur.com/HNSSO.gif)

So yeah, TL;DR let's talk about:

* [Traditional clothing/motifs that you would like to see/could see incorporated into daily wear?](http://i.imgur.com/1Mcxm.gif)
* [Do you have any old traditional outfits stashed away that you never wear? Would you wear bits of it?](http://i.imgur.com/GvMSD.gif)

One of my big problems is that I'm so used to wearing jeans and t-shirts (which I love, don't get me wrong!) that any time I wear a nice blouse or want to wear some heels I feel like I'm ""over dressing"" even though I see other girls wear it and look really cute! I recently began getting into make up to make my eyes stand out etc and really kind of look more put together but sometimes I still feel kinda meh about my style/look in general.

I've just recently acquired my first purse and sometimes I want to look nice and be able to feel like I look normal in cute outfits I want to buy but I can't get over the hump.

This probably sounds like a huge post of me being insecure but I feel pretty confident most of the time, I guess a **TL;DR** would be how can I look more ""put together"" and womanly without going over the top and feeling more comfortable with it? All tips welcome!

None. My closet consists of dark, long sleeved sweaters, cardigans and pants. Needless to say, it was time to go shopping yesterday. 

I was kind of surprised to see that in every store I went to, there was an unbelievable surplus of billowy, over-sized tops. The stores that I can afford shopping at aren't the best, but I can usually hunt pretty well through the poor quality, trendy items and find decent fitting basics at places like H&amp;M, Francesca's, F21, UO, Dry Goods, etc. I literally couldn't find a single ""fitted"" item of clothing, save a blazer or two this time, though.

I need some help finding summer clothes, I'm transgender and this is basically the first summer since transition and therefore I don't really have any experience :(


My shoulders aren't very wide or anything but I do have a rather broad and larger than average ribcage.  My band size is 34 however it's still considerably broader above my bust (which is lacking anyways).  I have lots of stretch marks from losing weight, if they're faded I don't care about having them shown but otherwise it is kinda eh.  I don't really find anything but crew necks flattering on me but this gets boring and frustrating :\

**Height** 5'7.5""

**Age** 19

**Measurements** My waistline is roughly 29"", if I've eaten or worked out then I don't really have a waistline at all.  My underbust is about 33"" but as stated above my ribcage is very broad and kind of sticks out in the back.  I wear a 34A.  I essentially have no hips, I wear size 6 jeans at American Eagle, however I can fit an XS/S belt with plenty of belt left.

**Body type** I'm not really sure, I'm not exactly an inverted triangle, I guess I'm kind of just a ruler with a very broad ribcage.  I lack any feminine fat patterns really.  I'm working on some poor posture from being on a computer all day all the time, this is getting better but it still does kinda make clothes less flattering across the board.  I'm still in the process of losing weight and currently still have some gut, but this will be gone at some point in the summer.

**Current Sizes** I recently bought small athletic shorts, capris and tops that all fit fairly fine (Nike, diadry, adidas brands).  ""Long and lean"" fit things tend not to fit me because of my ribcage.  A large t-shirt at American Eagle is fairly loose yet a medium doesn't really fit.  I have a large campus crew hoodie that is far too loose (pic of that [**here**](http://distilleryimage10.s3.amazonaws.com/686768287d0211e28b2322000a1fbe1b_7.jpg)), not sure what the smaller sizes are like on me.  A medium unisex shirt is fairly loose on me, not sure what a small is like (really should've tried this).  I have a medium top from forever21 that I could probably easily fit a small.  As mentioned my jean size is ~6, this is pretty comfy in the legs and I could probably even go down to a 4 if they're not super skinny - however it's very loose in the butt (I really have no butt).  Pic of me [**here**](http://imgur.com/IEkb9kM) in a medium adidas top (a little larger than a small nike which still fits well) and a push up bra.  I have to wear a sports bra in a large even though I have essentially no breast development and this is a little tight.

**Goals** I'd really love some kind of outfit with a skirt.  I'm not sure how I feel about shorts (I guess I should take a picture of me in my current athletic shorts).  I get pretty jealous of all these girls pulling off just wearing a tank top which in my mind looks pretty awful on me.

**Budget** I'm willing to put down $30 on a top if I find it actually does look good on me but I'd prefer lower end things.

**Location** Greater Toronto Area (Canada)

Even if I put together a list, and limit myself to only a few stores and a couple of hours, invariably I get fatigued and end up either purchasing nothing or making bad snap decisions that I later regret.  

Stores like H+M and Zara or huge department store sales really overwhelm me — I just get overstimulated with all of their merchandise and fellow shoppers.  I can't even go near a Goodwill or a thrift store without feeling annoyed.  Higher end stores with less merchandise don't make me feel as tired, but I probably end up spending more money for items I could easily find elsewhere.  

Online shopping is pretty good for certain things, (dresses mostly) but I am oddly sized and rather picky about the way things feel on my skin.  I can't tell you how many times I've been really excited to receive something in the mail only to be immediately disappointed! (I've probably returned ten times as many things to zappos as I've kept...)

So, do any of you also have this problem?  What are your strategies — candy bars? Shopping with friends?  Frequent water breaks?  



EDIT:  Thanks for all of the great tips everyone, you guys are fantastic!  I have a ton of items that I need to shop for this week, and I'm starting to get pumped.  

I think the thing I've realized is that I don't experience this shopping fatigue when I am grocery shopping or going shopping for someone else. I think this is because I probably have some personal issues.  I suppose I am dissatisfied with my body and my looks in general, and looking in the mirror and trying on items that don't fit exactly right just exacerbates my inner shame.  Also, I think I feel guilty when I'm shopping for not doing something ""productive"" and for spending money on something that feels vain.

* Bust: 35 in, Underbust: 27 in, Waist: 25.5 in, Hips: 31 in, legs are one inch longer than the rest of my body (hips and up), Butt: 34.5 in      
      
Body type: Hour-glass      
      
*Why?*      
      
I'm 19 and I've been wearing the same tank tops, t shirts, jean shorts, handful of sweaters, and skinny jeans for years. I'm a journalism major and going to need some nicer clothes pretty soon. Plus, I've been relying on cleavage to get dates for far too long. It's not attracting the sort of attention I want. I'd like to be looked at for being attractive in style, not boobs.      
      
*Me now?*      
      
My style is nothing, honestly. I wear whatever's in my closet and comfy or that I can find affordably at a thrift store.      
      
*Budget?*      
      
I've got 200 bucks to dedicate right now, and hopefully I'll land a job soon and have an income to take care of things. I just need to get started.

What are the rules for Jewelry?",MissLibrarianLady,60,8,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1cz6cn/jewelry_how_what_and_when_do_i_wear_it_what_are/,"I have a lot of random pieces and I have trouble putting it all together to create a cohesive look. I either end up not wearing things (and not getting to show them off) or not knowing how to wear them comfortably. I don't want to look like I'm trying too hard to pull something off. 

I always feel weird if I wear bracelets + earrings + a necklace + rings, like I have too much bling on. I have 4 silver rings that I wear daily and never come off, and when I wear gold I feel like I'm clashing. I also have trouble with knowing what styles of jewelry I can pull off with my figure. I have an apple shape with a large bust, so I've been told to wear long necklaces, but all of the statement pieces I am attracted to are shorter bib length necklaces. Plus, I am really short, so when I wear those long necklaces, it feels like they are dangling by my crotch (because they are), even when I knot them they still feel long, and then they sit between my breasts making them look huge and separated.

Then there is the issue of the huge variety in my jewelry box. I've got everything from punky spiked cuffs to pearl necklaces, and random others between. I will put together a nice outfit but as I am choosing a necklace it either dresses the outfit down way too much or up way too much. I can't wear a lot of cheap fashion jewelry because my skin will get a rash if the metal has nickel in it, but I would rather invest in good pieces that I will be able to wear with a lot of outfits and that will last a long time. 

I've been sort of stuck in a jewelry rut lately and not taking many risks or doing anything unique or different. I wear the same bracelets every day, just a stack of colorful natural stone bracelets (the stretchy kind), and alternate between a few pairs of dangly earrings. I don't try to color coordinate because most of my clothing is black or dark colors. 

I feel like my jewelry box is stuck in high school or my early twenties, I'm over the cheap fashion jewelry, and the Claire's boutique stuff (no offense if you still like it, but it's just not my taste). I don't really like the pastel stuff I see out right now, my taste is more toward bright/bold/chunky for casual or dark/elegant jewelry for dressy. I like statement pieces, conversation starters, and am capable of making a lot of my own stuff, I just have no clear idea of what direction to go in, and no inspiration to go off of. If you have links to pictures or shops, or advice, anything would help me right now. 

Is there a guide for what type of jewelry to wear with certain outfits, or how to wear certain types of jewelry? I feel like my mom never taught me how to wear things because she didn't wear much jewelry and I'm afraid that I am walking around looking really gaudy. If this is the wrong sub to post in then I apologize, please point me in the right direction. 

Sorry for the rambling post...I just had a lot of questions that I've been mulling over for a bit.

**Edit:** To give you an idea of my personal style, [this](http://i.imgur.com/VT9tyqy) is one of my favorite and most commented on pieces of jewelry, but it is cheap and the finish is wearing off. If I wear it on a hot day it itches my neck :( I'd love to replace it with something similarly edgy and cool, but still wearable with a lot of things.

I mean this kindly, though. I promise

I don't have any nice blouses, and it's definitely not a ""pretty dress-date"" and it's possibly not a date-date. I would very much like for her to be my girlfriend, and we did meet on a dating site, it's just a ""lets meet and see where this goes"" thing, at a mall, where we will eat lunch at a the food court and then go thrift shopping together. This is our first face-to-face meet.

I know that one should always dress for the situation one *wants* to be in, so I should try and look pretty, even if it just turns out to be a ""lets be friends"" deal, but I don't really *own* anything nice, and I currently have zero monies to buy something fancier. My only ""nice"" clothes are fancy cocktail dresses. 

Basically, I'm wracked with self doubt. You know the drill.  

**[ Here is my outfit.](http://imgur.com/a/b3Ol2)** Included is a close up picture of the detailing on my shirt, and a picture of the bracelet I'm wearing. I'll also be wearing my necklace and earrings in the pictures. I also have a picture with the makeup I intend to wear, and possibly how I'll style my hair.  

 I always like to be simple with my clothes, and glam with my hair/makeup. I pretty much *always* wear simple or nice tops, jeans, and my docs, so I feel this is representative of who I am clothing wise. I have simple black nail polish planned as well.

---
A few months ago /u/12cats [proposed running a Weekly Theme Contest](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/wge45/weekly_theme_contest/).

We’ll alternate between a more challenging and abstract theme and a normal situation. That is, we might do something like “19th Century Romantic x Gothic Poet” followed by the far more practical “Dinner at noma”

The judges will convene on Friday and announce the winner on Tuesday’s Themed WAYWT Official Submissions thread.  Moderators can play but are disqualified from winning.  No prizes are offered, but you get bragging rights. Bragging rights that are so awesome, your great-grandchildren will be talking about it for ages to come. Ok maybe not.  But you get bragging rights on top of the karma you’ve already reaped.

Theme
---
**Ugly Christmas Sweater**

'tis the season!   

Use this announcement thread to post inspiration photos for fellow contestants or as a record for yourself. Feel free to try and recreate an outfit, put a spin on an old idea, or come up with something completely new. The official outfit submission thread will follow next week, on Tuesday (12/4).


Rules
---
Contest themes will be announced on **Tuesdays**. We’ll then post the outfit submission thread the following Tuesday morning around 11AM PST.

The “winner” will be selected by committee based on the following criteria:

1. How closely it caters to our personal interests. Anything J. Crew will, of course, instantly capture the password/faux vote.
1. Inventiveness
1. Something else totally subjective
1. A random die roll
1. Phase of moon


Those 5 will be combined into a composite score and then thrown away. As with “Whose Line Is it Anyway?” the rules are made up and the points don’t matter. Go out and have fun!

I'm getting married in 10 weeks or so and when I had my first dress fitting last week, the seamstress told me that I really need to get my butt in gear and pick out my shoes (true). I just brought my most comfortable pair of heels (~3"" Joan and Davids) to the appointment so we could get an idea of how much the dress needed to be hemmed, and after even just a half hour of standing there, my feet were totally numb. I do better when walking around, but still, the idea of being in heels for so long is daunting!

Does anyone have suggestions for super comfortable heels, or specific things I should look for in a shoe that can make them more comfortable? The shoes will be mostly hidden by my dress so I'm really not *too* picky about style or color, although I was thinking that blue would be cute. I have fairly narrow feet that are about a 6.5-7, so it shouldn't be too difficult to find options in my size, either. I haven't ever tried gel inserts - do those actually work?

Thank you all for any suggestions or advice you may have.

I was pretty dissatisfied with most of the fashion blogs out there, so I wanted to create something that was a little smarter, more critical and self-aware. I don't see it as a fashion blog, so much as a blog on style and aesthetics, not just from fashion shows but also film, art and other things in life. A lot of menswear blogs serve as inspiration to way I blog (and dress).

I am most proud of my ""[Curating and Collecting](http://ofstrangersensibilities.blogspot.com/search/label/Curating%20and%20Collecting)"" series that I have been writing on my blog. Curating your wardrobe has been growing in popularity both in practice and as an idea. Through this on-going series, I tried to examine this phenomenon on the general public, the economy, and of course, its effects on my own wardrobe personally. I am not the only blogger writing about curation; there are many fellow blogger-curators to be found in my links page. 

I am more than happy to talk about anything else: film, art, the latest factory accidents in Bangladesh, the increasing amount of derivative fashion in European luxury labels (I am looking at you Hedi and Alexander), P-I-T-A (Preppy Ivy Trad Americana), growing Chinese appetite for luxury goods, consumption habits, the evolution of high street labels, favourite magazines, and more, down to tips on how to run blogs, grow a community, make online blogger friends (YES MUM THAT IS A THING), coding tips, blog resources, blog branding + social media (oh look at me I am using all the buzzwords), etc. Anything but the latest trends, because it's been a long long time since I've bought any mainstream magazine. 

Thanks for having me! I will hang around until 2:30 EST hoping to answer as many questions as I can. 

Edit: B/c I am such a n00b at Reddit and am so slow at responding to people, I am more than happy to stay longer, past 2:30 if needed, to answer *all* questions. 

Edit 2: I am in the process of finishing up answering all existing questions. If you have any more questions/more clarifications needed on the answers I gave, please feel free to email me at joy@ofstrangersensibilities.com.

The wedding is in May, the attire is Black Tie, and the formal dinner/reception is going to be at a pretty fancy hotel. I've never been to anything that requires black tie in my life, and to make matters worse I'm going to be 8 months pregnant during the wedding. I'm really dreading dropping a lot of money on a nice dress and then not being able to wear it ever again. 

So my first choice is this dress. It isn't a maternity dress so I'm hoping I might be able to wear it again someday: [http://shop.nordstrom.com/S/xscape-lace-cap-sleeve-mesh-gown-plus/3435952?origin=category&amp;BaseUrl=Dresses](http://shop.nordstrom.com/S/xscape-lace-cap-sleeve-mesh-gown-plus/3435952?origin=category&amp;BaseUrl=Dresses)

Is it formal enough? I'm kind of paranoid about the fabric being too casual, but at the same time...I'm going to be 8 months pregnant so my choices are slim. They don't seem to make very many formal maternity gowns. Other suggestions are welcome. I'd prefer something floor length, under $250, and my pre-pregnancy dress size was 14. 

Assuming the above dress is okay, I have no idea what to do for shoes. Heels are out of the question. I assume I'll have a little bit of leeway with a floor length dress, but I need some suggestions for comfortable dressy shoes that won't kill a pregnant lady's feet. I'd prefer something under $100 and they have to come in size 11. 

Also, I know this subreddit is strictly for clothes, but does anyone know if black tie necessitates an updo? I'd really just prefer to wear my hair down, but I don't know if that's a huge faux pas or something.

I didn't take a picture of my underwear or sock drawer or bra and corset drawer but you get the idea (although I also cleaned out my bra drawer and kept 2 bras from Victorias Secret that did fit and I bought 3 new bras, a 30B, a 32B, and a 30D) and I need to put jeans, sweatpants/athletic pants, etc in now since I've done laundry, but yeah. I also didn't take pics of my hats or handbags, although I went through those too. I kept my berets that I wear, my winter hats that I wear, two baseball caps that I do wear, and of my handbags, backpacks etc that I had, I kept a Coach leather messenger bag, my Coach poppy collection bag, my two Coach Legacy bags, my boyfriend has gifted me 3 new Coach bags of varying styles and sizes, a vintage Coach bag, and a Kenneth Cole reaction bag, and all other bags, backpacks, etc that didn't get use or weren't the right sizes for me got donated. I also donated belts, scarves, etc, and kept my two newer scarves that I wear regularly, and my two waist belts that actually fit.

Before any of you decide I am messing around, I am not. I am in a human sexuality course and Thursday is gender role reversal day. We're supposed to dress as the opposite sex(in this case as a female) and, well, I have no idea what I am doing. I would ask my mom but she is no help since I am at school. A friend that is a girl? They're all pretty busy. I MIGHT be able to get one to help me before then, if not, thats why I am here.

I am about 6'1 in terms of height, 200-208lbs or so, and 19 years old. According to that one calculator, I am a ""spoon"" =/

I guess I already answered why? This is a one time thing for a class and I could use some help. My budget is about $40-50, this is for one day, and afterall I am in college with the need to save money. I am nearly sure Ill run to tjmaxx one day after class(probably later today) and get some simple things. To save money I really only plan to get the basics, no purses, earings, things of that nature.

I have relatively big glutes and quads... if possible I would totally avoid jeans and anything too tight down there. I have really considered wearing some type of dress. Maybe one of those ""white tank top looking things with the colored band and floral bottom"". 

Maybe something like [this](http://d1535dk28ea235.cloudfront.net/preset_65/luuux_1_27.jpg)? If so could that work for my size and what would I exactly look for. I would also want a pair of matching shoes(mens size 11-12, depending) and that is about it.

If anyone has experience with what I could find at tjmaxx for a decent price that would be great! I don't need to look perfect, this is just for a day, though, I would like to have some fun with it.

1376128827.0,47,self.femalefashionadvice,1k2zpv,"[Fashion Discussion] Fashion, the Environment, and you",,55,8,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1k2zpv/fashion_discussion_fashion_the_environment_and_you/,"I'm new to posting in this subreddit, , but I'd like to have a discussion about fashion, the environment, and you!

I did my homework and saw that there have been posts (one good one in particular between 1-3 months ago about Ethics and Fashion) RELATED to this topic, but not directly dealing with it. The fact that the original poster actually questioned the ""future sustainability of textiles"" is actually what gave me the motivation to do this post, because there is no future sustainability of textiles. Textiles are unsustainable as is, and let me explain.

* The manufacturing of any good comes with its environmental costs, logically. I'd like to just set that as the baseline before delving further into specifics with references. But especially consider that most clothing is manufactured outside of (most of) your Western or ""developed"" nations that have laws ""protecting"" the environment by controlling emission standards and having waste management programs.

* The fibers that make up clothing are unsustainable. [This link] (http://www.greenchoices.org/green-living/clothes/environmental-impacts) gives a brief overview of how the production of the fabrics themselves are unsustainable. Some highlights are basically that some synthetic fabrics (nylon, polyester) are not biodegradable, and that natural fibers, like cotton utilize pesticides (also not biodegradable) known to damage ecosystems and contaminate the water supply, as well as being actually responsible for human deaths each year.

* [This link] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1964887/) gives a more journalistic approach to the issue and Demonstrates the consumer culture at play here. A highlight:

&gt;Only about one-fifth of the clothing donated to charities is directly used or sold in their thrift shops. Says Rivoli, “There are nowhere near enough people in America to absorb the mountains of castoffs, even if they were given away.”

   While the article goes on to explain that excess clothing is often sold to be recycled, recycling is another manufacturing process with its own costs.

Another highlight:
&gt;According to Well Dressed?, about 60% of the energy used in the life cycle of a cotton T-shirt is related to postpurchase washing and drying at high temperatures; transportation constitutes only a small portion of the energy profile to produce a cotton product.


These are just an extremely brief overview of the major issues at play here (wasteful consumer culture, direct contamination of ecosystems, etc.) I'd like to hear what other people have to say on these issues. 

In the meantime, I'd like to say: I love fashion, and I love the environment (the environment more, frankly), but I don't let these seemingly contradicting ideals stand in the way of me living a life that I'm proud of. Yes, I buy things new that aren't sustainably made at times (although I always do it when those items are on clearance, so the store doesn't make as much if any profit off of the item, excepting under wear stuffs). Here are a few tips of mine if you're interesed.

**My suggestions for cutting down on your impact as a fashionista**

* As many people already suggest, buy classic, durable items that will last. Added benefit: You save money in the long run!

* Always try to buy used first. If sifting through a thrift store isn't your thing, try sites like etsy or the vintage section of modcloth and American Apparel that sell used items. DO THIS ESPECIALLY FOR YOUR LEATHER PRODUCTS, as they will likely still be in *great* shape and are more likely to be classics that won't ever look dated. Added benefits: Unique items for a more unique style, and it's usually cheaper.

* Support eco-friendly clothing products. I personally have a few great items made out of bamboo, but there are also hemp products, organic cotton products, etc. In a consumer culture like most of ours, purchasing power is a bigger factor than people realize. Added benefit: Natural and organic fibers are so much more comfortable on the skin (at least in my opinion).

* Wash your clothes less often. Added benefit: They'll last longer and look better. I legitimately only wash things if I (or my boyfriend) can smell it or if I accidentally get something on the item (and then it's usually a hand wash).

* When you do wash your clothes, wash them in cold water. Heating water takes a surprising amount of energy. Added benefit: Again, it's better for the garment.

* In FFA threads, always suggest these things to other users!

* In a similar vein, look for sustainable, natural, and organic alternatives for your beauty products. I use organic face makeup, bamboo makeup brushes, natural mineral lip stuff, and all of my moisturizers and cleansers are all organic and natural. (I have been unable to find organic eye stuff.) Added benefit: It's better for your skin, better for your hair. I can't tell you how many compliments I get on how clear my skin in and how soft my hair is.

I’m not a professional photographer or model or anything, but I do spend a lot of time on FFA and I thought I’d make a guide to taking better quality, easier to understand photos so that the advice we give can be 100x more accurate. 


**What’s a Good Photo look like?** A good photo shows your entire outfit, including shoes, in a *natural standing pose that accurately shows the color, fit and proportions of your outfit.* There should be enough light that we can see every part of your outfit equally clearly – for good advice, guessing doesn’t work. The best photo angle is straight on. “Lifestyle” shots are okay, as long as we can clearly see the details of the outfit and the picture is of just you.


**Required Equipment:** You don’t need a fancy-dancy camera or tripod to take a quality photo submission. A point and shoot or a laptop with a webcam is really all you need. I don’t recommend using a phone camera because even the iPhone/Android tends to be blurrier than necessary or distort the colors of the image. 


**How do I get a good image?** The best thing to do is to get someone else to take the picture for you. It can be a little awkward, but all you need to do is approach your friend/roommate/mom/boyfriend and say, “Hey, this sounds dumb. I follow this style forum and I wanted to post my outfit for feedback.” When they laugh at you, remember that fashion is pain.  But seriously, the easiest way to go about getting a good picture is just to ask.


**But I’m Forever Alone!** If you can’t get anyone else to take the picture, the next best option is to use the self-timer on a point and shoot camera or laptop (Photobooth on Mac was MADE for this). Set the timer for a decent amount of time and place if on a flat, even surface. Again, make sure that you can see your entire outfit – it may take a few tries to get it right, and this is where an inexpensive tripod can work wonders. 


**Can’t I just take it in the mirror?** No! Mirror pictures either need to be taken at a strange angle and throw off the proportions of the outfit and have you doing a crazy, unrealistic pose; or they’re blurry or have a giant flash in them or otherwise render the image useless. NO.


**Where should I take the picture?** Outdoors and in natural light is the best, but if you can’t manage that, anywhere with adequate lighting will do.


**But I don’t want to post my face on the Internet!** Posting your face on the internet can be sketch, I get it. But if you need advice, we need pictures. The best thing to do is to post on an alt account and cover your face – blur it on photoshop, *or draw an oval that fits the size of your face exactly.* Any smaller or larger will throw off the proportions of your body, so don’t copy and paste a celebrity face, either. 

*To easily cover your face on a mac: open the picture with Preview. Go to Tools, then Annotate, then select add Oval. From there you can adjust the size and color.*


**How should I pose?** Again, I’m not a model. But standing naturally and smiling is always a good way to go.  


**Can’t I just take a picture of the clothes?** Absolutely not. Even if you’re just asking wether two colors match or not, it’s hard to make a judgement call when were not seeing the clothes on your body. After all, a color can look different set against your carpet than it does set against your skin. *If you’re looking for any kind of advice, the best thing to do is to put on the outfit as you plan on wearing it so we can get a holistic view.*


**Do I NEED to submit a photo?** Most likely, yes. For any kind of advice, photos are the best way to give your accurate opinions. From “what should I wear to this wedding?!” to “I need to dress like an adult!” photos of you, your current style, and clothes you’re into help us determine the best advice to give you. We can’t judge a description of an outfit. 


**To Recap, Do:**

Have someone else take the picture for you or use your self-timer.

Get your entire body, standing in the shot.

Use natural lighting so that we can get an accurate view of the colors. 

Put on the outfit as you plan on wearing it. 

Feel free to use an alt account and cover your face.

Pose naturally!

**Don’t:**

Take the picture in the mirror, especially with a phone.

Take a picture of just the clothing.

Post only a description of the outfit.

Cover your entire head so we can’t make an accurate judgment of proportion.

Submit a photo from too far away or with three other people in it
 
Forget to submit a photo!

What I'm looking for is:

* A clear guide on how to ID what catagory your skin/hair/eyes put you in (I've seen a lot saying ""if you look best in these colors, then you are ___"" and that's not really helpful: If I knew instictively what looked good, I wouldn't need the guide!). Also, some guides say ""If you have really clear colors, then you are __"" which isn't helpful either, as I don't know what would make a 'clear' tone. Also, some of the skin-color guides give a long list of beige in different degrees of pale-ness, which isn't what I'm looking for - I want something about undertones - if they say 'ivory', I don't know if they are just talking tha pale-ness or if it's implied it has a specefic undertone, for example. Also, what should one put as hair-color if it is dyed? 

* More specific catagorys than just warm vs. cool - also, if they need to be adjusted for light vs. dark skin!

* A list of what colors and nances work and **why** (as in, why never jewel-green, but lots of army green or vice versa etc.)

* tips for colors of hair and make-up.

First things first: I've realized for some time that **if FFA is to be a truly diverse and welcoming and helpful community to women of all stripes and styles, we need to reflect that in the content we produce**. Right now, for me, that means compiling a list of plus-size resources: bloggers, shops, industry-oriented sites, whatever. The increasing amount of requests for plus-size advice has made it clear that this is something that could be really helpful for FFA, and it also highlights our commitment to diversity in fashion and in this subreddit.

**[Here's the current draft spreadsheet of plus-size resources](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aq7vKDQhKwdodEZXczJzUVlzb04zSlZnYkVwX2NwbHc#gid=1)**! You'll note a few things:

* It's somewhat short and incomplete. *Read below for how you can help, although rest assured I'm still working on fleshing it out with the help of other FFAers*.
* There's a blog sheet and a shops sheet. *I know /r/plussize has a list of shops already, but due to historical issues with FFA relying on content made/owned by a third party who has taken it down, I'm a little more comfortable also having a separate FFA resource in event of catastrophe. It also allows us to curate the shops to FFA's particular tastes and needs*.

I chose to separate the plus-size resources from the official blogroll we have now ^(which by the way is gonna get revamped as well, *sometime* this summer) to make it more accessible to /r/plussize subscribers as well.

The reason for this announcement is to **publicize the link for people who don't know about it**, and also **request help and input from the community**. But while I'm at it, another announcement…

## FFA's Sidebar Summer

It's clear that from [past discussions](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/15weq9/ffa_whats_missing_from_the_sidebar/) and current questions that there's a lot of information that FFA frequently requests or wants—and it would be *wonderful* if we had a few more resources we could point people to in that regard!

Depending on interest in the idea, I'll write up a separate announcement for this, but currently, here's what I'm thinking—it's almost summer. I like alliteration. I'm planning on doing a huge content push for FFA over the summer *anyways* and I think it'd be really fun if we had more than a few people all working on content and relying on each other for support/help. It's been wonderful to see how dedicated and interested many FFAers are in the progress of the subreddit, so I'm inviting you to pitch in and help out the community at large.

Specifically—bulking up our sidebar. Here's a list of the initiatives people have expressed interest in previously:

* /u/aneong and /u/dwindling: high fashion coverage + discussion of fashion labels and runway collections
* /u/ifilmmachat (and possible /u/lostafarian): intro to prep and menswear style
* /u/SuperStellar: materials guide and garment care (probably taking cues from her excellent guide on [bra care](http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/16qlui/a_guide_to_bra_care/) for /r/abrathatfits
* /u/thethirdsilence: interview wear for various situations
* /u/wikifrench: walkthrough on a DIY/garment construction project

For those listed—please don't take this as a guilt trip ^(well, maybe it is). If you are still interested in doing this for FFA, this thread is a great place to solicit feedback + find collaborators to work with.

If you *want* to contribute something to FFA—an inspiration album, a guide, a list of resources, **I highly encourage you to try and start that**. FFA now has an incredibly diverse and knowledgeable community—in the past the majority of subreddit content was created by the moderators, but I'm hopeful now that there are members of our community that can help out a great deal as well. Some ideas for content you could contribute:

* guide on getting started with a certain style
* guide on tailoring and alterations
* a walkthrough for a particular DIY/fashion project
* a writeup on fashion history or a particular designer/brand
* guide on a particular item (tees, boots, heels, whatever)

I'll also add that good discussions—and these do an immense deal to create value in the subreddit, while also being perhaps a bit less work on your end. =)

## Anticipated Frequently Asked Questions

**How can I help with the plus-size resources?** 

* *Small contributions*: Comment here or PM me with content you'd like to see included (whether blogs, shops, or something else you think this should have)! 
* *Larger or long-term contributions*: If you'd like to get more seriously involved—please PM me with your email address, and I can add you to the list of editors/collaborators on the document.

**I want a similar resource for some other demographic/topic!** Given how busy the moderation team is, we're not really taking requests for content to write at the moment. However, if you have some modicum of knowledge on a topic/are willing to do a bit of research, *please feel free to write your own guide!* I highly suggest posting in this thread or posting a new thread asking for volunteers to collaborate with, as well. I'll work with you guys to make the content sidebar-worthy, if that's your goal. However, I'll note that any kind of thorough and helpful content being produced on behalf of the sub will earn you my undying gratitude in any case.

**What is sidebar-worthy/worthy of being included in an official FFA compendium of resources?** Briefly—something that meets the standards we already have in our sidebar or in one of the compilations (reasonably comprehensive, articulate), addresses a topic of interest to the community (lurk the new queue for a bit and see what questions continually pop up!). I'll note too that I'm working on fleshing out the [FFA wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/wiki/index) as another list of FFA resources—some content, like particularly good discussions, may not necessarily be sidebar-able due to the specificity of the topic, but might be well-worth including there.

Edit 1: There's no way for me to edit the title, but I would like to alert everyone that my use of the word ""gypsy"" to describe my style has stopped. The fantastic /u/ModestMalka brought it to my attention that it was a derogatory slur for the Romani people and it is totally inappropriate to use! 

Likewise, I'm glad this post has opened up some discussion on the EXTREMELY IMPORTANT issue of Cultural Appropriation. I don't culturally appropriate, or, well, I try my hardest not to, but as a teenager and a Buddhist, that line is blurred and it's extremely helpful to see a welcoming and intelligent attitude on the issue below - PS, this attitude is huge reason I love FFA.

I will be attending an afternoon Catholic wedding in late April followed by an evening ballroom reception. The groom is my boyfriend's cousin, so his whole family will be there! I am told it will be a modern wedding. This is the only dress I own that is anywhere near appropriate. 
[Photos are here.](http://imgur.com/a/J87Yr)



My main concerns are:


1. the material is a wool/felt type of material (You can see it in the third picture). Do you girls think that is fancy enough for an evening reception? I know that most other girls will be wearing shinier, more revealing dresses (the type one may wear to a club) but I am not sure where to buy those. 


2. the mid length sleeves may be frowned upon in NYC in late April. 


I spent the whole day dress shopping for this wedding but I was unable to find anything suitable in my local JC Penney, Dress Barn or Marshalls. I would love store suggestions. I am a bit of a tomboy so fashion and clothing shopping in general is not my forte! All help would be appreciated. 


I live in Brooklyn, NYC. My price range is anything under $80. I would prefer something classic that I can use for future weddings. If it helps, I am 24 years old, and 5'5"". My measurements are as follows:


Bust: 32


Waist: 24


Hip: 34

Edit: Thanks everyone! I appreciate your time and input, even if I did not individually thank you for your comment.

**But in all seriousness, it was with these thoughts that I assembled [this inspiration album for your visual and mental pleasure.](http://imgur.com/a/O3d0M)**

(It's best to view this in fullscreen on imgur.)

None of these hats are terribly groundbreaking, if you're looking for more conceptual/avant garde stuff, I highly advise you take a look at [this inspiration album that was posted as couple months ago.](http://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/13xac8/inspiration_headgear_hats/) Instead, most of the images I chose are streetstyle photos since I wanted to focus on how hats affect the shape and form of an outfit. Thus, the hats kind of fell into three categories:

* The black hat (also black baseball caps)
* Hella straw hats
* Some more unusual hat choices/head wraps/motherfucking shoe hats!

I understand that there's currently a black beanie/condom hat trend going on, but [fuck that.](http://i.imgur.com/YCwMBgP.png) (Feel free to tell me why I'm wrong, but I didn't include any beanies.) And while I adore Otto von Bismarck, I'm not that [hot on his sartorial choices.](http://i.imgur.com/bSaHaiI.jpg)

At the same time, I think a hat can do a lot to enhance and alter the shape of an outfit without taking it over necessarily. My purpose for making this album was to make people think about wearing hats and about shapes and silhouettes in general, I guess, [whether that was effective or not.](http://i.imgur.com/jTAEDtq.gif)

Let's look at [this outfit](http://cdn.dressed.so/i/50a9359b628e1m.jpg) that lady_syrupp posted. It obviously kicks ass. But what if she were 50 pounds heavier? 100 pounds? Would everyone recommend that she switch to a boot cut jean, avoid boots that make the ankles look tiny compared to thick thighs, get a thicker sweater that wouldn't show rolls or bulges? Would that outfit look sloppy and awkward instead of sleek? Can an overweight woman look sleek without hiding everything?

I came across [this blog](http://www.nadiaaboulhosn.com/) the other day and found a beautiful thick woman who wears skinny jeans and crop tops and platform heels. Here's a few examples:

* [Skinny jeans](http://i798.photobucket.com/albums/yy270/nadiaaboulhosn/IMG_7854.jpg)
* [peplum top](http://i798.photobucket.com/albums/yy270/nadiaaboulhosn/DSC_0148-1.png)
* [crop top and peg pants](http://i798.photobucket.com/albums/yy270/nadiaaboulhosn/DSC_1120.png)

Can a thicker woman wear clothes that are fashionable, even though they don't ""flatter her body type"" and still look good? If you saw her on the street would you think she looks ridiculous (okay, imagine if she weren't so darn pretty and was wearing the same outfits)? What if she were 50 pounds heavier?

Discuss!

edit: I chose photos of outfits that I, as a curvy lady myself, would like to wear and my selection bias may have led me to pick more flattering outfits, but you get the picture. This model also, while ""thick"", is by no means obese or anything but I honestly couldn't find anyone heavier wearing outfits like this. Is it because they just don't look good?

Hey  FFA,

Many people have requested someone write up a list/guide to various brands, so
beginners have an idea of where to start. Since there's a lot of stores, and
we're pretty lazy/busy, we've decided to try and crowdsource it. We've created a
form anyone can fill out to describe a Store/Brand; we'll collate all the
results and create a database from them (after some data sanity checking) that
can be easily searched and referenced by newcomers and long-time members alike.

Below is a list of brands that we quickly scraped, feel free to suggest more in
the comments and we'll add them to the list. As people submit info, we'll strike
them through so you know when a response has been accepted and we don't see too
many repeats. We look forward to your submissions!

Height: 5'1""

Age: 18 years
Body type: Hourglass

I'm a recovering bulimic, and although I weigh more than I'm comfortable with at the moment, my weight is stable and I'd like to stay away from weight loss until I consider myself well enough to *not* slip back. The problem is that, with my body the way it is now, I've not a clue as to how I should dress myself. 

I'm starting back at school in a couple of days and would like to look feminine and stylish, but not to attract *too* much attention. 

I love oversized tops, knits, and some lace. I like to look feminine, but skirts and dresses aren't my cup of tea. I wear my fair share of leggings and skinny jeans as it is, but I need to expand on that!

The best I've felt about wearing it was in the winter paired with some tall leather boots (maybe cowboy boots would work, always wanted to get some) I realize some of the details are really outdated, like the sleeves and lace up front, but I don't want to alter it.  Any advice?  Thanks!

You guys were awesome with feedback and advice!!

I ended up buying a less form-fitting dress with a similar cut to cosplay as Clara from Doctor Who, specifically a t-shirt dress in size S from American Apparel. It fit a lot better and I got to wear a smaller size which definitely gave me a bit more of an ego-boost! I also got some awesome bright red converse shoes which I am so excited to wear around all the time now!

Here is an album of pictures: http://imgur.com/a/wF75c  I posted it to /r/doctorwho and /r/TwoXChromosomes for image fest Friday because I finally have something to be excited about on a Friday!!

I have a few questions and I figured this was the place to ask them :)


**Why?**

I'm a 22 year old girl with long blonde hair. I'm starting college (again) soon and I want to look better. Since I've always been a plus sized girl I never had much to choose from when I was younger, so I'd just buy something if I liked it and it fitted. I've always been quite chaotic in clothes, as in just buying whatever I like without paying much attention to how it looks on me, or whether I needed it or not. So now I have a whole lot of stuff and some basic outfits I like to wear, but I want to be taken more seriously and want to be able to represent myself in a stylish fashion every day, and not just some of the days and look like a slob the rest.


**Measurements**

Weight: 95 - 99kg / 209-218 lbs (according to google) Lately it's been the latter

Length: 178-180cm / 5'10'' 

Bra size: 85 C (I live in Europe, I'm not sure about the measurements over there)


**Shape**

I'm not sure which body shape I have, it changes with my weight from almost apple, to pear I believe. I do not have big breasts when it comes in comparison with the rest of my body. I do however have a huge butt and great big upper thighs. My lower legs are quite well shaped in my opinion, I don't have big calves or ankles.


**Things I already know (or believe to know)**

I try to refrain from lighter jeans as they give the optical illusion of having even bigger legs. I always try to wear dark denim jeans with no washed up or worn down (lighter) patches on the upper leg area as I've heard this makes them appear bigger as well. Basically my everyday look always includes high waisted dark denim jeans, as it is a thick fabric which doesnt show off my love handles that well. I have an odd fashion sense, I love skinny jeans and I've worn them for quite some time but lately I went to flared jeans as I read that this looks much better on people with thicker upper legs. 
Since I'm quite tall I don't usually take time or effort to wear high heels, only to very special occasions. So I have a lot of flat shoes. I do however own basic black &amp; brown heels, and basic black &amp; brown boots with heels.

**Some pics of my current style of dressing:**

**My desired style:**

I'd like to own some more dresses and especially skirts. Right now I have absolutely no clue what to wear when it comes to skirts, and I feel I can't really pull it off with my huge butt. One problem I also always have is that the skirt is higher at the back, than it is at the front (this also because of my butt) but I have to admit I shop cheap, so maybe this would be fixed by buying better quality clothes at more expensive shops (?). Since I'm starting college I would like to be taken seriously, so the style I want to go for is business casual I believe, however I want to keep it feminine and a little sexy, and not too boring. Also, this ( http://i.imgur.com/K9mxA.jpg ) is my new school bag, I have some other bags too but I'm planning on using this one mostly, so I would like to find some stuff that matches my bag. I recently found supercute ankle boots ( http://i.imgur.com/qzEtv.jpg ) to match with them, what kind of clothes should I wear with it? Any way that I can involve the belt, too? Or would that be too much?


I used to wear gothic style clothes way back (the antique style, with dresses, corsets and ruffles), and I love lolita clothes although I wouldn't necisarily wear them. I don't have a problem with trying some of that stuff or incorporating certain elements of that.

**Budget:**

Well since we have different stores here (Netherlands) I don't think it would be very useful to you guys to know, but I'm willing to invest around 100 euros in a great skirt, that I can wear with a lot of outfits, but preferably less. 


**Stuff I don't really like:**

I'm willing to try basically anything to see if it works, but there are a few things I wouldn't really wear if it were up to me:

- Huge floral prints

- Skirts longer than knee

- Denim jackets

- Light denim jeans


**Questions:**

- I love to wear longer stuff in an effort to hide my thighs, but lately I've been reading that it is better to have your tops cut around your hips. Is this true? 
- I really like skinny jeans, is there any way for me to pull them off? Same goes for pencil skirts, I love how sophisticated they look!! 
- I've been having great problems trying to find the right skirt for me. I've read that flared skirts go well for pear shapes, but (in my opinion) they make my butt look HUGE (same goes for basically any skirt, but maybe thats just because I haven't found the right one yet). Any advice? Are there a few rules of thumb I need to keep in mind for skirt shopping?
- I love the idea of having a belt midwaist or like, under my breasts, since I'm smaller there. I have a few big belts, but I've been hearing different stories, one says small belts are the way to go if you're plus-size and the other says big belts. Advice? :D
- I'm not quite sure which kind of top I need to wear. I've been reading a top that draws attention to the breast/shoulder area. I think in my case it would be breast area? However I do not own stuff with lots of details added to the neckline and I am on a budget.


I dont have much problems with showing off some cleavage, I do however not feel really comfortable in very short skirts, unless I wear stockings underneath, which then makes it kind of okay. I also am quite self-conscious when I sit down to check if there are no curves showing, but I guess permenantly wearing shapewear would kind of fix this. 


To be short: I'm a plus-sized girl looking for some advice and tips on what and how to wear it. I'm on a budget. What are some basic things I should add to my wardrobe?

On an average day I am mistaken for being 15-16, and it confuses me because I think I dress pretty well - no Hollister/Abercrombie-esque graphic logo tees or anything close to that. It's a major pain not being taken seriously by others because they assume me to be in high school. I even read something about how eyeliner/mascara ""ages"" you, so tried that and nope, still getting the whole ""what year of high school are you in?"" treatment from strangers. Guys don't hit on me because they think I'm jailbait, etc. I also have curly hair, and while I take care of that, I feel like it only serves to make me look younger. Of course, I'm also blessed with chubby cheeks, which totally doesn't help my cause either. This summer I've been mostly wearing dresses /tights/nice shoes, or a cardigan/blouse/jean shorts/Converse.

I'm 5'3"", 140 pounds, and my body type is straight but bordering hourglass according to that shopyourshape website (my bra size is 34C, noticeable butt/hips, and a noticeable but not extremely defined waist). I'm looking to create a simple, feminine, flattering, and classy yet age-appropriate wardrobe that is budget friendly (think H&amp;M priced) and I have a thing for scarves and cardigans (not necessarily together). I'd love to have a style that made people look at me and go, ""that girl must be in college!"", but something stylish and impressive. If it would help for me to dress more like I was in my early 20's, I wouldn't mind. I'm looking to buy tops, bottoms, and shoes, and general clothing article suggestions as well as store suggestions would be much appreciated.

If you'd like me to provide any additional details, don't hesitate to ask.  And if you have any non-clothing tips for how I can better look my age, definitely don't hesitate to clue me in.

There are designated smoking areas but I have to walk through some of them to get to class (there is one right outside of the building most of my classes are in, and right outside of the Student Union).

I asked my doctor and she said that I might benefit from wearing a surgical mask when outside to help filter some of the air so that I'm not sent into a coughing fit or an asthma attack. I have a few options, like 1) not wearing one, 2) wearing a plain blue one, or 3) wearing one like [this](http://www.dhgate.com/product/fashion-anti-dust-mouth-muffle-cute-respirator/84990736.html). These ones are made to look cute, mostly for people in Asian countries like China where there is a lot of smog. They're available in animals, flower patterns, band logos, blah blah.

I was wondering if anyone has experience with these types of mask or this type of situation.

And a no-makeup face, in case for some reason that changes opinions of what style I could rock. Hair is normally stick straight.

See, I used to weigh about 185lbs. I knew how to dress 35lbs and a few years ago, but now I'm a stay at home mom with a body that confuses me. What the butt am I supposed to do? What is my body type? What kind of clothing would look the best on me? As a SAHM I have a lot of freedom with how I dress because I don't exactly have a boss to judge me. Last time I tried to be fashionable it was the height of the belting craze (and of my weight) and I had a lot of long bulky belted sweaters, and that looks completely awful on me now.

At the moment, my style is truly lazy and depressed. I shop for cheap clothing because I don't know how to dress this body, so I end up in jeans and a t-shirt a lot, even though I adore dresses and being fancy. I love twee, bohemian styles, and rockabilly fashion, but because I don't know what looks good on me anymore (and most of my clothing falls off of my body) I just go the boring Walmart jeans and t-shirt route.

Measurements are:

30"" underbust

36"" standing bust

38"" leaning bust

29"" at the smallest part of my waist

38"" at the widest part of my torso when measured loosely but 

30"" when constrained

41"" hips (baby got back)

30"" inseam

So, /r/ffa, what would you do if you had this body?

Edit: I'm not quite concerned with the price side of things, as I'm looking more for general advice. Does this body work better with flowing tunics or tight shirts? Skinny jeans or boot cut? Layers and flowy or simple and structured? Any sort of advice or whims about what you would do with this figure would be great.

Do you like to look neat or more disheveled? 

I find I like many styles best when people cut against type. A very neat polished punk rock type look looks more interesting to me than a disheveled one. My ideal conception of my style is an elegant dishevelment--I like a lot of tailored pieces (blazers, pencil skirts, etc) but don't really like to look ""buttoned up."" My hair helps with this because it's big/curly, but in general I try to play with my clothing a bit (partial cuffing etc) to further this. However, I have a hard time with the line between looking a little disheveled/dgaf and not just looking messy.

edit: I think this preference evovles from the fact I enjoy over-dressing and it's really hard to get my hair to look 'neat'.

edit edit: Hmm the direction this discussion has gone in is pretty interesting to me. It seems like almost all the posters aspire to look ""polished"" and see the end goal as becoming polished, whether they feel they have achieved that. I feel like less polished looks can be more interesting/exciting and have been intentionally working on evolving from my super polished work look to something more disheveled/RATE for my time as a grad student/non work life.

I hadn't realized (beyond our sub at least) that fast fashion is becoming less popular.

Do you think this is accurate? What do you think the future of these chains are if cheap fashion maybe be coming to an end?
