NPR can be reached [here](http://help.npr.org/npr/includes/customer/npr/custforms/contactus.aspx?sid=15).

This is my comment:

&gt; Dear Tell Me More,

&gt;Reddit.com was mentioned in this morning's show of Tell me More about cyber harassment, and I feel it was not held in the correct light. The guest mentioned that her personal pictures were uploaded to the website and her image and reputation was defamed. I sympathize with her and this injustice should not go unnoticed; however she branded the website Reddit.com with the image that this kind of behavior and content is the main attraction of the website.

&gt;Reddit.com is a social news website, such that anyone can register an account (without the need of an e-mail address) and upload any link from the internet onto Reddit. Images can be uploaded using an image hosting website, such as Photobucket.com, ImageShack.com, or the most popular choice, imgur.com. 

&gt;Reddit has grown exponentially since it's inception in 2005. It used to be a website for ""tech"" related content, but it soon grew into a much larger 'web' of content. I use the word 'web' specifically, because Reddit is structured very much like a spider web. On Reddit, there are such things as 'subreddits,' which are subcategories that a member can visit and subscribe to, which will make their 'frontpage' more geared towards their own interests and hobbies. Subreddits are created by users, so they can range from any topic. For example, I personally frequent /r/bicycling, /r/linux, /r/yoga, and /r/books and other subreddits that peak my interest. There is even an /r/npr (these subreddits are pronounced as such: /r/npr = r npr; /r/bicycling = r bicycling; etc.). However, since the growth of Reddit has attracted all kinds of users throughout the world, the creation of ""Not Safe For Work"" subreddits is inevitable. Even these ""18+"" subreddits range over various topics, and since they are moderated only by those who created the subreddit and whoever he or she appoints as moderators, content on these subreddits is often unmonitored by Reddit administrators. There are not subreddits containing child pornography, since content as such is pulled from the website by Reddit admins and any subreddits or users promoting such content are banned from Reddit.

&gt;Sexism and racism are a very real problem on the internet, and Reddit.com is no exception. Being a 'Redditor' since 2009, I can personally vouch that Reddit used to have a very low number of sexist and racist comments. However, the website now has tens of millions of unique visitors, and the open and anonymous nature of Reddit allows anyone to say whatever they please. Reddit.com as a whole is not racist or sexist, but many users can and will express their opinions. The same goes for any other website that allows for commenting by users, such as YouTube.com, FoxNews.com, Facebook.com, or 4chan.org. 

&gt;Your guest was unfortunate enough to fall victim of a terrible crime in which the perpetrator uploaded content of her to Reddit. Unfortunately for her, images uploaded on the internet will theoretically never stop circulating. These crimes can be prevented by keeping personal images hidden safely, and by choosing dating partners more carefully. Your guest saw the warning signs, and she should have acted sooner and ended all contact with whomever uploaded her personal images.

&gt;I thank NPR for providing free and entertaining content over the radio that I listen to everyday. However, I feel that Reddit was brought under the wrong spotlight. I am asking Tell Me More to announce that the website Reddit.com is not a haven for sexual deviants. Even though unwelcome content can be uploaded on Reddit, there is much better content and better subreddits to be mentioned. I would like to shine the spotlight on one subreddit specifically, /r/SuicideWatch, which helps those who seek help with depression, and who are thinking about committing suicide. There are many other subreddits that lend a helping hand and make a real difference in the community and in the world. 

&gt;In conclusion, Reddit.com has it's good content and bad content, but please do not allow for it to be defamed by only mentioning the bad content, because the good greatly outnumbers the bad. 

&gt;I allow permission for NPR to use excerpts from this comment if it were to be mentioned on the air.

Please write to NPR mentioning that Reddit was put under the wrong light, and that Reddit as a whole is not a website for sexual deviants.

Enough sophistry can be found in Alva Noë's recent NPR peice entitled [""What's The Big Deal About Privacy?""](http://www.npr.org/blogs/13.7/2013/08/16/212546316/whats-the-big-deal-about-privacy) that to simply utter a ""Pft"" over my morning coffee without giving form to my objections would do a disservice to the nation's mythical privacy debate.  (""Mythical"" because at this stage the debate, as in Mr. Noë's article, is constructed to give the impression that for all the alarm expressed by privacy advocates, the rest of the nation is too busy posting selfies to care about the larger implications of the information they share.)  But there are a dangerous set of miscalculations and elisions happening here which Mr. Noë would do well to recognize.

First, the willingess to accept targeted advertisements from a company that offers a platform for expression is nothing–*NOTHING*–like having every communication surveilled, stored, and retrieved by the alphabet soup of government agencies.  The zeitgeist may be Narcissus hovering over the vast pond of social media that glamorizes his reflection, but it is an error to assume this behavior somehow translates to a willfull subrogation of privacy in every sense.  With the recent disclosures of the NSA's surveillance capabilities, more Americans are compelled to reevaluate the erosion of privacy in the proper context, [leading many to conclude that things have gone much too far](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/29/poll-nsa-surveillance-privacy-pew).

Second, the case could certainly be made that our inclination for privacy is simply underserved.  For even as we preen and gawk, the services so many use every day would have long ago been abandoned if they didn't offer the option to block or exclude certain users.  And when simple processes exist, such as private browser modes; or add-ons that delete, block, or disrupt tracking cookies and flash, millions of people employ them to reclaim some modest amount of power.  Contrasted with the complex, evolving technical process of shielding our privacy, the relative ease of creating a social media account is within the scope of a lonely night's desperate impulse.  As such, it's clear that we aren't so much giving away personal information as having it swindled through the narcotics of social acceptance and convenient communication.

Of course there are plenty of narcissistic, self-aggrandizing, willfully ignorant people bloviating in online fora about issues of limited importance these days.  But let's call this phenomenon what it is–*philistinism*–and recognize that it's thriving in nearly every corner of society, public and private.  Let's also avoid conflating it with the many distinct motives people operate under when they join and interact in online communities.  For the purposes of freer, deeper, more meaningful interactions, privacy, for many of us, is a tremendous asset.  How one could be blasé about such a thing and not recognize in it a very similar solace to the tender, vulnerable moments just before sleep when, in darkness, we confide our innermost to a nearby loved one is beyond my comprehension.  Maybe Alva Noë could fire up a throwaway and explain.",,False,self,t5_2qnbd,False,,,True,t3_1kjko7,http://www.reddit.com/r/NPR/comments/1kjko7/what_you_probably_meant_to_say_was_whats_the_big/,

At least there isn't a easy way of doing it that I know of. 

My Job requires me to drive and get in and out of my car a lot. So sometimes I hear the begining or a teaser for a show and miss 80% of what I want to listen to. I generally remember the time of day they aired but never the name of the show. 

For instance today I heard quite a few shows but missed a lot of the conversation. Among them was a story about a guy who pulled a gun on a person. Cats killing too many animals especially birds. The waitress that put the receipt on Reddit. And the French involvement in Mali. None of these shows were on the front page tonight 3 AM. I had to go to each show and push the previous button. 

*Also I have donated $20 to NPR, would like to do the same thing for Radiotimes but I don't want to be a member I wish there was a way to give them money without becoming a member.

Even better are the times that they play clips that have some subtle relevance to the issue or story being discussed (wish I could think of a better example, but Pink Floyd - Money clips being played during segment about economics).

I'd like you to take a listen to today's story about the global garment market.   Notice the only angle covered in this story is market demand.  In other words, the onus is on the consumer to ""vote with their dollars"" to support the ethical treatment of workers.  

If this story had been produced 30 or 40 years ago, the assumption might be that government should either shut the factory down or limit imports from factories that treat workers like chattel in death traps -- or even that private union representation makes for safer working environments.  

All of these angles were completely ignored in favor of the modern neoliberal worldview that morality and ethical working conditions are measured by the dollar, and if people aren't willing to pay for it, then the implication is that it doesn't really have merit in the market.",,False,self,t5_2qnbd,False,,,True,t3_1dh6bk,http://www.reddit.com/r/NPR/comments/1dh6bk/the_right_wing_neoliberal_bias_inherent_in_some/,

On hearing most of this whole thing, I noticed there were *""facts""* pointed out that were biased and based on generalizations of the so called ""Youths"". At one point, the interviewee said something akin to ""the younger generations doesn't understand democracy"" and ""the younger generations has a lesser view of privacy then the older generations"". I think some fact checking would be in order. One could be certain that some of the younger generation have a more liberal take on privacy. However, and obviously, the younger generation keeps more stuff private then we let on, or we wouldn't have books like  ""Not Much Just Chillin' "" by Linda Perstine, as one example. If this interview included both sides I have been much happier with Terry Gross's performance with this.

1339230396.0,2,self.NPR,usyhg,Dos Erres,dadoug,2,0,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/NPR/comments/usyhg/dos_erres/,"Dear This American Life,

Let me begin by saying that I am an avid, lifelong fan and can specifically remember listening to broadcasts 15 years ago. Your work has helped me grow and challenge and laugh and cry and I believe that it is a jewel in the American artistic and journalistic landscape. Furthermore, I'm quite sure that you have touched and educated thousands of other lives as you have mine. Thank you. I mean it.

As usual your recent show What Happened at Dos Erres was superbly executed radio. You manage to move and engage the listener by exploring the humanity of the bad guys and the bravery of the good guys. You show us the profound role that serendipity can play in this Journey that we all take. And, most importantly, by choosing this subject in particular you are doing a service to human kind.

I think, however, that you glossed-over a crucial point of context for this issue by not discussing more thoroughly the involvement of the USA in Guatemala and in Latin America generally. There is a vast scholarly record which convincingly shows that American support for these crimes was systematic (it involved multiple government agencies), persistent (it spanned many years and presidential administrations) and crucial (including arms, training, diplomatic cover and coups d'état). 

It is not true, as Mr. Glass informs us in a two-minute interlude where this aspect of the subject is addressed, that after the US State Department ""concluded that the Guatemalan military was responsible"" for the massacre at Dos Erres that simply ""nothing was done."" Indeed the documentary record, including the declassified records cited by Mr. Glass, show that when confronted by many such cases (and in many countries) the US government did, in fact, take decisive action; namely they **increased** funding, arms sales, training and diplomatic cover for the perpetrators.

The case of Guatemala is particularly illustrative in the context of international law. By 1986, after years of Dos Erres's and worse crimes, the United States was condemned by the World Court for the ""unlawful use of force"" (a euphemism for terrorism, if not out right aggression) which ruled that the aid being sent to Guatemala was military in nature and not humanitarian. The US was ordered to pay reparations. Instead, it ignored the ruling and again increased funding to the people committing the crimes. One can only wonder how much easier the jobs of the brave prosecutors and investigators profiled in your show might have been if they had had the support of the US rather than facing explicit opposition. One might further wonder about why facilitators of these crimes walk free in our own country.

Historically there is a clear strain of this kind of activity stretching from the establishment of the Monroe Doctrine to Allende in Chile right up to the most recent coup in Honduras. While you cannot be expected to cover hundreds of years of history, it was striking that nothing of this pattern was mentioned or explored.

To be clear, I am not, in any way, arguing that one should ""blame America first"" or that the human side of this story was not masterfully delivered. I simply want to point out that these crimes were not committed in a vacuum and that I feel that we owe it to the courageous people profiled in your show -- and hundreds more like them -- to tell the whole truth. Especially in the cases, like Guatemala, where our own government played an important, if not vital, role.

Recently This American Life has commendably gone out of its way to rectify specific factual mistakes made when publishing Mike Daisy's story about working conditions in China. When settling this issue it was rightly emphasized that, despite errors in the details of the reporting, the broader point about the abysmal situation of the workers was well founded. In contrast, I think that in this case my favorite show of all time has gotten every literal fact correct while missing a very important aspect of the broader context.

Yet in all of it, he didn't appear to even once point out to this Morsi supporter and offical (I think) from the Morsi administration that Morsi arrogated to himself dictatorial powers, the most extreme insult to democracy. I was screaming at the radio. Even Charlie Rose and his panel failed to really make note of this, what undoubtely began the erosion of confidence. And this was no small fissure; it was a stunning act of incredible, nearly incomprehensible disrespect for democracy. The idea of an elected president in a new democracy just suddenly declaring himself autocrat is breathtaking. Yet most commentaries on the current events take it all as power issues, whether the coup of whatever you call it is an assault on democrcy, and how things like the economy led the people not to wait for the next elections, as if Morsi hadn't declared himself nearly emperor.

Yeah, I called a few times. I was on the train and instead of pushing buttons playing Kingdom Rush I thought I'd call and see how high I could get the number.

Someone answered, twice. I was hung up on, twice. My views? Contradictory to the person on the radio.
