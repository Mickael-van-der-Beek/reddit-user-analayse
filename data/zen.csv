This could possibly be a life changing experience, and some idiot hawking fruit on the street, when you ask for the best one could say ""they're all the best"", then your precious ego that you've spent your entire life cultivating could be crushed in a flash. The only reasonable thing to do is to protect yourself from this calamity, so I've constructed this formula so that you may shield yourself against accidental enlightenment, which left Joshu ruined and homeless.

Make strong judgments very quickly, being sure to always make sharp discriminations between things. Also, don't pay too much attention to uninterpreted reality; don't look at the beauty of nature in silence, or allow some gap in your stream of thought. Something might slip through the cracks uninterpreted, alerting you to the fact that what you perceive as reality is a web of judgment, discrimination, and conceptual thought, and that something else exists beneath it. So, being busy *could* help, but even still, if you're paying too much attention, that could be a problem. It's best to stay busy without really fully absorbing or paying too much attention to anything. React as quickly as possible things, and try not to see them as they are; make sure you consider how they relate to you, and whether they're good or bad for you. Don't try to grasp the reality of the thing, that could very easily accidentally enlighten you. It's essential that you *think* something about it, and have some feeling toward it, as quickly as possible, shielding you from any contact with uninterpreted reality.

Hopefully, if you don't like the idea of enlightenment, these simple guidelines will help stop an otherwise innocuous word or phrase from causing it!",,False,,t5_2qhmf,1371973442.0,,,True,t3_1gwdz6,http://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/1gwdz6/how_to_protect_yourself_against_accidental/,

Some of his quotes are actually pretty amazing. I'll give some examples.

""Whether it's a potato or a nut, it's a foodage."" 

""What are those things in Gremlins called?""

""Suzanne read the paper while I played with a ladybird""

""If you live in a glass house, don't go chucking stuff about""

""People who live in a glass house have to answer the door""

""You won't get anything done by planning."" 

On chameleons - ""Stay green. Stay in the woods. Stay safe.""  

""A problem solved, is a problem...caused."" 

""there was this guy, he had a helmet on, he hit a lamp post...but his head come off.""

On Art ""Stop looking at the walls, look out the window."" 

""Does the brain control you or are you controlling the brain? I don't know if I'm in charge of mine."" 

(On Ricky asking him to do a diary next year)""No I wouldn't, you know, cos you do the same stuff ever year don't ya? It's set up the same way: January, February it's the same thing, it's the same routine"" 
""It's just easier to put stuff off once we've got this calendar, whereas if we didnt have a date you'd have to do everythin' straight away"" 
""Say if I was in charge and someone said that buildin' needs knockin' down, it's dangerous, if we didn't have a calendar we'd go 'erm let's do it now then.' Whereas cos we've got a calendar it's easy to say...'next Wednesday'"" 

""They say it all started out with a big bang. But, what I wonder is, was it a big bang or did it just seem big because there wasn't anything else drown it out at the time?"" 

Reminds me of this

&gt;""Moment to moment, and with every step, the Fool leaves the past behind. He carries nothing more than his purity, innocence and trust""

http://www.osho.com/magazine/tarot/TarotCardNew.cfm?All=Yes&amp;Nr=57/

&gt;""Be a fool in the Taoist sense, in the Zen sense. Don´t try to create a wall of knowledge around you. Whatsoever experience comes to you, let it happen, and then go on dropping it. Go on cleaning your mind continuously; go on dying to the past so you remain in the present, herenow, as if just born, just a babe""

Thinking through this I realised I never really got ""Then you had better wash your bowl."". I only understood it to mean that the zen simplicity was knowing that after eating comes washing the bowl and by doing that you could stay in the moment. But I can see it can also mean having done something let go of it. Stay empty.

The thing about not Zen, other than that it is ""not Zen"", is that it doesn't amount to anything.  The old men said it, but what can you build with it?  ""Not Zen"" is only interesting when people insist that they know what Zen is, if they have faith in a idea or a practice and claim that sort of thing is what is Zen.  Of course the people who insist that they know what Zen is aren't going to read a book called ""not Zen"".  Ha!  Now that's market research.

A: What sort of *thing* do you suppose the Way to be, that you should wish to follow it?

Q: What instructions have the Masters everywhere given for dhyana-practice and the study of the Dharma?

A: Words used to attract the dull of wit are not to be trusted.

Q: If those teachings were meant for the dull-witted, I have yet to hear what Dharma has been taught to those of really high capacity.

A: If they are really men of high capacity, where could they find people to follow?  If they seek from within themselves, they will find nothing tangible; how much less can they find a Dharma worthy of their attention elsewhere!  Do not look to what is called the Dharma by preachers, for what sort of Dharma could that be?

Q: If that is so, should we not seek for anything at all?

A: By conceding this, you would save yourself a lot of mental effort.

Q: But in this way everything would be eliminated.  There cannot be just nothing.

A: Who called it nothing?  Who was this fellow?  But you wanted to *seek* for something.

Q: Since there is no need to seek, why do you also say that not everything is eliminated?

A: Not to seek is to rest tranquil.  Who told you to eliminate anything?  Look at the void in front of your eyes.  How can you produce it or eliminate it?

Q: If I could reach this Dharma, would it be like the void?

A: Morning and night I have explained to you that the Void is both One and Manifold.  I said this as a temporary expedient, but you are building up concepts from it.

Q: Do you mean that we should not form concepts as human beings normally do?

A: I have not prevented you; but concepts are related to the senses; and, when feeling takes place, wisdom is shut out.

Q: Then should we avoid any feeling in relation to the Dharma?

A: Where no feeling arises, who can say that you are right?

Q: Why do you speak as though I was mistaken in all the questions I have asked Your Reverence?

""Your body is not bounded by the surface of your skin, you know. The sun and moon are your body. The oceans and rivers are your body. The whole Universe is your body. The Buddha built his religion upon *this* mind, *this* consciousness. Sometimes you call it body, sometimes you call it God. We don't use any name for it. When you observe that your mind is as boundless as the sky, an endless Universe, and your present state - *this* moment - is here...that is all. When you have to express yourself by speech, you must realize *it is not Zen*. All the writings are in your heart, they are inherent, the intrinsic law of your nature. You cannot find this anywhere outside yourself.""

Internet History begins with usenet, thanks to Google's Group archives. There's two groups about zen: [alt.zen](
https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/alt.zen) and [alt.philosophy.zen](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/alt.philosophy.zen), both with recorded history back to 1994. You can read all of the old posts. If you're tired of /r/zen, go read it. You'll find more gems and more bullshit. It all depends on what you find yourself looking for. There's always more not-zen to be found, if sought. 

Take it for what it is. /r/zen isn't what you want it to be, it isn't what you believe it is. /r/zen is what it is. Am I Right? But, unlike Actual Zen, /r/zen isn't something meaningful, it isn't something you find at the end of your spiritual path. 

/r/zen is just a bunch of people burning some time when they probably should be building true human connections, gaining true insights, off on true adventures or learning true knowledge. /r/zen is just here, because we're here, and we're here jerking around. There's nothing wrong with that.

This is one of the things that never quite 'clicked' with me until now:

Attachment leads to suffering.

As a person that has never really been attached to material things I own, treating them all like dirt etc,.  I never understood how attachment can lead to suffering.  And then I realized... attachment can apply to all sorts of things like *ego*.  And that really hit home.

When you get mad and frustrated about losing at a game that you're supposed to be really good at. 

When someone appears to insult you or your intelligence

When somebody talks behind your back.

That's all stems from attachment to things like ego.  When outside events seem to contradict or threaten your attachment to this concept of self, we react by getting upset, getting angry and therefore... suffering.

His only response was ""[Is that so?](http://users.rider.edu/~suler/zenstory/isthatso.html)""

Jesus has somewhat of the same lesson to teach saying not to resist evil but to  ""[turn the other cheek](http://bible.cc/matthew/5-39.htm)"".

Laozai got at a similar idea, teaching that

    Stop thinking, and end your problems.
    What difference between yes and no?
    What difference between success and failure?
    Must you value what others value,
    avoid what others avoid?
    How ridiculous!

The point I am trying to make here is that there is no reason for the negativity, division, and personal attacks that seem to be creeping into this sub lately.

**Ask yourself**

The ""truth"" is true, what defense does it need?

Is someone else expressing their view an affront to you?

Is there a reason for harsh words to be traded here?

From the Dammapada:

    It is not new, O Atula! 
    It has always been done from ancient times. 
    They blame one who is silent, 
    they blame one who speaks much, 
    they blame one who speaks little. 
    There is no one in this world who is not blamed.

All of say and do things that are ""incorrect"". Does being the one to get in someone's face about it gain you anything?

In levying these critiques, I realize I show hypocrisy - in some of my own comments here I fall under these critiques. This posting itself is also imperfect and contains contradiction. I hope this will not detract from what I am asking here.

Why can't /r/zen be a friendly place where people can share their experience, knowledge, opinion and resources without constantly being told they are totally wrong and being insulted?

Maybe I am simple or overly sensitive, but shouldn't this community feel like a bunch of happy buddhists? To me it feels more like a bunch of Pharisees and Sadducees trading insults.

**[Offender for a word](http://bible.cc/isaiah/29-21.htm)**

I haven't been in this sub for very long, and I don't know much about Zen, but I can't imagine that our community should be full of faultfinding and nitpicking.

    There is no one in this world who is not blamed.

For example, lets take my above statement that *""I don't know much about Zen""*.

Some might point out an error in thinking that one can ""know"" anything about Zen. Or that there is anything to know.

Some might point out that in criticizing faultfinding, I am myself being a faultfinder.

Some might ask why I'm wasting time [posting online](http://xkcd.com/386/) when I could just be sitting. (this is nearest my own sentiment)

Point is, I'm wrong and you're wrong. That is an uninteresting observation. If you can satisfy one school of thought with a statement, you'll be wrong in the eyes of another. Disagreement doesn't matter. Someone being ""wrong"" doesn't matter. Your version of the ""truth"" doesn't matter.

Harmony probably does matter. I feel like we are trading that for the [lentil stew](http://bible.cc/genesis/25-34.htm) of proving a point, telling someone they are wrong, or displaying knowledge and cleverness.

Some of us like to play with words in Zazen. Some of us like ""religious"" symbols. Some of us just want to sit in Shikantaza. Some of this conflicts. Rinzai types will tend to carry a bit of an attitude toward the perceived ""nothing doers"" and quietists will tend to think the koanists are missing the mark distracted in silly wordplay. The doctrinarians tend to be dismayed that both seem to have tossed out the Dharma. 

Get over it. Different strokes for different folks. I don't see how this community is the place to fight those battles. From what I can tell, most of us are at the point when we should be doing more listening and learning and understanding and a lot less telling eachother we're wrong.

**Some common grievances that lead to disharmony**

-*Ego accusations.* Most of us still harbor an active ego. Big whoop. You're not helping. Its the ego that gets pissed at the ego display in others. And then it cycles. Don't continue the cycle. As far as I can tell, ego accusations are the Godwin's law of these kind of communities.

-*Accusation of pretense, or trying to sound cryptic, tricky, or wise*. Firstly, don't assume motive. Secondly, words are clumsy tools, sometimes you have to fuck around with them to say what you want. Sometimes all you can say is Mu. And yah, sometimes someone is just trying to sound like Laozai to sound all smart. Big deal, no skin off your nose. What do you or anyone else gain by straining at it?

-*Tough love, trying to shake someone into realization.* Yah, Master Rinzai yelled at people and hit them with sticks to shock them into center. As far as I know, no one here is anyone elses master, or has been invited to verbally brutalize them or their viewpoint. Nor do most of us have anything close to the compassion or insight of a master. Extreme statements should be coming from extreme certainty. Most of us need to be cultivating great doubt right now, not certainty.

-*Aggressive reductionism.* We all have areas where we feel that others are adding needless bullshit. You could go around all day long saying ""Zen isn't that, its just this"". And you might be right. But where in Zen is going around telling people that what they value is bullshit? We all have different ways of bridging the symbolic divide. Some do it by reduction to simplicity, some do it by using method, word or symbol to configure the understanding to experiance simplicity. Why not share ideas and ""insights"" instead of go about looking for bits of carnality to pick off eachother's bones?

Each of you could probably add to this list. Most of us have done a few of these. Lets just not. I feel like this should be a place where people can ask questions without being told its dumb or pointless and people can share belief, knowledge and experience without being attacked.

**TL;DR ""True"" Zen**

If this community were any good, I suspect /r/zen would have that wonderfully insightful reddit message ""there doesn't seem to be anything here"". But we like to talk. We like to share. Hopefully we like to listen and try to understand others.

I feel like instead of civility and kindness, we are edging toward a culture of confrontation and criticism. I don't see this as productive or necessary. 

Or so says me.

I tend to listen to Alan Watts or Anthony DeMello or any number of other ""spiritual"" audiobooks to relax myself, even though sometimes they frustrate me because I feel like I don't get what they're saying.

This morning as I was listening and drifting back toward sleep something he said made perfect sense.  He said something to the effect that our minds are troubleshooters, they exist to scan the environment for dangers, and if we identify with that then we will be in a perpetual state of anxiety.  Then I realized that when I am my most calm I'm not thinking about things, I'm just being alive.  That was a great realization that after I thought about it, I felt I always knew.  When I was my happiest in life I flowed from one thing to the next and never dwelled on anything really, and everything was okay, even when bad things happened, they passed and that was that.

So then when he went on to explain that we are not separate from anything, including each other, and the rocks, and the stars, and light and dark, it clicked.  It makes sense now.  If we stop trying to control, and analyze and change things, that peace that comes is what we really are.  We're it.  We're everything and everything is us.

Does anyone else feel this way?  Has anyone else not only understood but experienced this in their own life?  I really used to live this way when I was a young teenager and some how I got caught up in thought and finding everything to be wrong or trying to change things and struggling so hard to change things or myself.  I feel almost as if I've rediscovered a secret I hid from myself.

Now many of the things I've heard from these spiritual books is making a LOT of sense and it makes me laugh that I didn't get it before.

I'm working on the assumption that most of us are relatively immature in our practice, and if this assumption is correct, any attempts to teach on our part could cause more harm than good (for example, people latch on to and walk away with subtly wrong ideas).  I'd be a lot more comfortable with this subreddit if we could resist the temptation to

* make authoritative-sounding statements: Zen is X, Zen is not X
* dispense spiritual advice: this **includes** IMHO things like “just sit” 

On the other hand, I imagine that these behaviours are probably “safe” and unlikely to perpetuate misunderstanding:

* sharing our personal experiences as students
* grappling publicly with the teachings we hear or texts we read
* posting interesting links
* handing out practical (easily testable) advice: things like zafus, places to practice, etc

If we are asked for advice, we should probably steer folks towards people more suitable than us to give such advice. 

If we do absolutely want to bestow our understanding on the world, I think it'd be best if we could somehow qualify it with an awareness of our personal limitations.  IANZM (I am not a Zen Master) is probably not ~~enough~~ what I had in mind, but if we would somehow make it a bit clearer where we're speaking from, it could be helpful.

(I'm not optimistic that this would posting will affect people who are hell bent on handing out their Zen wisdom; but I'm hoping that it would bend the subreddit culture a bit and maybe make some like-minded folks a bit more aggressive in down-voting)

**Edit**: attempt at clarifying the IANZM thing, was really just a sort of strawman example

----

**Followup** Thank-you for the (gulp!) humbling responses, folks!  To address a few points:

* No, I am not an authority to judge on the quality of your postings
* … or for that matter on what your qualifications are.  I didn't mean this in a formal “you must have X level of Zen” way, but it was still presumptuous of me
* The sting of the “who are you to judge” remarks have helped reflect my getting [caught up in the demands of my own ego](http://www.101zenstories.com/index.php?story=71), and yes a sort of yearning for approval in the form up/down-votes. Thanks, live and learn.
* My remarks were more aimed at delivery than content. I'm not commenting on any particular content I feel is wrong, so much as saying that we should avoid conveying authority unless we are in a position to do so.  *That said, the rebukes are still well-deserved as it's unlikely that I would have felt compelled to post had I not had a personal ಠ_ಠ reaction to the content*
* How do we know we are in such a position? I don't know.  I have my personal prejudices whereby (for good or ill) I will place some amount of faith in institutions/communities/hierarchies, but these are just personal.  It was sort of deliberately left open-ended so that people could work out what that meant for themselves.  **EDIT** Friend made a great point that this sort of refrain-from-teaching-until-so-qualified mentality only really applies if you've already signed up for that sort of environment, which isn't universally the case.
* No, these isn't an attempt to impose rules on the reddit.  I was trying to advocate some principles for self-restraint, a bit similar to how one should tell people to seek legal advice from a lawyer, or medical advice from a doctor.  I did indeed also mention hoping to maybe encourage like-minded people in the reddit problematic looking postings, but yes, can see that this is a bit fraught with danger in its own way.

Having been smacked around a bit, I do still feel like I was trying to get at something potentially useful, but it does bring up all sorts of interesting discussions about what constitutes authority, practice, etc. Dunno if I will be able to tease that out from the various traps I'd walked into, though.

1374239027.0,41,self.zen,1immye,/r/zen 2013 census results,EricKow,46,5,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/1immye/rzen_2013_census_results/,"Hi all,

I'd like to follow up on the the recent /r/zen 2013 census from a few weeks ago. We posted a [6 question survey][survey] from 23 June to 13 July, mostly to get a sense of who we are as a community and what we could do to improve this subreddit.  Thanks much to the 300 respondants for your answers and feedback!

## Zennographics

We'll start with some basic demographic information. Assuming survey respondents are representative of the community as a whole, /r/zen is consists mainly of people in the 15-24, and 25-44 [age brackets][age] (roughly evenly divided at 46% and 48%). We also have some folks over 45 (around 5%), a handful of people under 15 (1%), and of the respondents one person 65 and older. Hello!

A small majority of us practise meditation in some form (60% of respondents), but less than a quarter of us (17%) practise within the context of a sangha.

For those of us who are in sanghas, roughly half practise Sōtō Zen, followed by less than a quarter (19%) who practise Rinzai Zen and (8%) who practise the hybrid Sanbo Kyodan form (including Kapleau lineage). The Japanese Zen traditions make up the majority of sangha-based practitce, but we also have 11% of practitioners in the Korean Seon and 6% (ie. 3 respondants) in the Chinese Chán traditions, and 2% (ie. one respondant) in the Vietnamese Thiền tradition. Note that these categories are not quite mutually exclusive, as 3 of our responsdants (6%) practise in two lineages simultaneously.

    Sōtō (25)         47%
    Rinzai (10)       19%
    Seon (6)          11%
    Sanbo Kyodan (4)   8%
    Chán (3)           6%
    OTHER (8)         15%

## Free-form text methodology

So that's it for the easy part of the survey! The rest of it becomes a bit fuzzier and draws into focus questions about good survey methodology.  Luckily this is really just an informal online poll, and the pressure is off a little to get things right, and at the same time, because it is an amateur poll, the results and their interpretation should be taken with a heaping mound of salt.

The two remaining questions were free-form text questions, first about what makes you interested in Zen, and second about how we could improve /r/zen.  To step back from these comments a bit, and glean some bigger picture insights from the responses, I incrementally marked each response with a small set of codes (adjusting the codes as I went).  So if somebody said, that what made them interested in Zen was “Its minimalist, no nonsense path to truth.”, I marked it as “simplicity, truth”.  If they said “It's like Buddhism, but it's not like Buddhism. Also, koans are fun.”, I marked it as “buddhism, koans, approach”. There's a lot of grey area to this coding, and what pigeon holes you use can change the distribution of the answers quite a bit.  Hope I got this right!  This coding scheme later turned out to be too fine grained, so with the help of a computer program I also made an aggregation pass, lumping together codes which I felt were somewhat similar.

## What makes you interested in Zen? ([word cloud](http://i.imgur.com/DQj3uY1.png))

Here's what I have for what brings people to Zen (percentages are among people who gave answers to this question):

    approach (29)                 15%
    peace/suffering  (27)         14%
    philosophy/media (27)         14%
    self-improvement (26)         14%
    buddhism/spirituality (19)    10%
    reality    (18)               10%
    life/background (16)           9%
    non-dual/suchness/
        mu/attachment/ego (16)     9%
    enlightenment (11)             6%
    present-moment    (8)          4%
    curiosity    (7)               4%
    koans/meditation (6)           3%
    related-arts (5)               3%

As you can see, our motivations even pigeon-holed and simplified to this degree are fairly diverse.  It's hard for me to say anything that captures the community really from this distribution of answers (keeping in mind that people can give more than one).  Maybe you'll have better luck?

Some initial thoughts might be that there's a good chunk of us who would like to find better ways of living through Zen, the 14% who spoke of peace or sufferring, and the 14% who spoke more directly about self-improvement, and also the 9% who came here because of something in their background (eg. personal difficulties).  Explicit spiritiuality or Buddhism only accounts for 10% of respondants, but you could also broaden the net to also include people who mentioned things about eg. peace/suffering, truth/reality, the present moment.  Interestingly only 14% of respondants seem to be in it for the intellectual side of things, the books, philosophy, Alan Watts, etc.  Again, please don't take these interpretations too seriously.  The main thing I'm walking away with is a sense of how multifaceted this community can be.

## How can we make /r/zen better?

Finally, since we were already filling out a survey anyway, I decided to take the opportunity to solicit feedback from the broader community.  Using the same methodology of coding and then aggregating free-form responses, we got these thoughts about where we should take things:

    status-quo (34)            27%
    behaviour (23)             18%
    content (21)               17%
    events/infrastructure (20) 16%
    participants (19)          15%
    moderation (11)             9%
    more-newbie-friendly (4)    3%
    
A good quarter of respondants either explicitly wanted things to stay the same, or just stated they were happy with the way things are.  Next, 18% (a little less than 1 in 5) participants would to see something change about the behaviour of their fellow redditors (eg. “less pretentiousness”, or “don't be so judgement of people who know nothing about Zen“).  A similar number of people (17%) wanted to see better/different content of some sort, eg. one who said “[I]'d like to see more discussion linking current events with historical lessons”.  And after that, 16% suggested either improvements to our infrastructure (eg. fleshing out the wiki), or more events.  Some 15% said something about participants, eg generally about wanting more people who “know what they're talking about”.  And yes, names were named, although both in positive and in the negative.  Tying into people's desire for behaviour (or perhaps content) to change, 9% of respondants called for more moderator action.  And last, 4 respondants (3%) said something rather interesting about making this community more friendly to beginners.  While this is a relatively minor points in terms of numbers, I found it very interesting/sobering, and hope we can indeed do more to keep things welcoming to folks who are new to either the Zen or /r/zen communities.

## Till next year?

Phew, that's all I have for now.  I'll be trawling through the detailed comments with the rest of the mod team in time.  Apologies for not answering any of them specifically.

Thanks once more to those of you who took the time to fill out the survey and give us feedback on the community!  It's easy to forget the silent majority among us who mainly interact as lurkers, so I'm especially grateful to have had the chance to hear from some of you. 

Cheers,

Eric

**Edit 13:43 UTC**: 60% is hardly “most of us” (who practise meditation)

## Details on interest coding:

* Approach refers means some perceived unique characteristic of Zen, eg. humour, contradiction, etc, and is also lumped together with “simplicity” (quite a popular response in its own right).  
* Media refers to books, talks, basically anything you can read, listen to, watch.  I felt it belonged with philosophy (which includes things like “new ideas, new ways of thinking about things) in the sense that both are things that appeal to us intellectually.  
* Self-improvement includes basically anything about the self, eg. “happiness” or the desire to find “balance”. 
* Non-dual, suchness, mu, attachment, ego were all individual codes which I felt I had a  hard time using consistently anyway (eg. what do you do with “looking up at the sky”? filed under suchness), and were similar in their appeal (indirectly or otherwise) to a Zen technical term. 
* Related arts refers to other disciplines that may have piqued the respondant's curiosity (eg. kendo).

So our first attempt at running the /r/zen Student to Student sessions fell on its face, with first our volunteer presumably getting swamped by other demands.  Sorry about that!  Zen monks can be a fairly busy lot.  

Let’s try again. Our next volunteer is a nun in the Rinzai lineage (a little bit more about her below).  Not only that, she is also a Redditor (/u/RedditHermit and /u/whoosho) and has quite a bit of familiarity with the /r/zen community.  

## How this works

*One Monk, One Month, One Question.*

1. (You) reply to this post, with questions about Zen for our volunteer.
2. We collect questions for 2 or 3 days
3. On 2 April, the volunteer chooses one of these questions, for example, the top-voted one or one they find particularly interesting
4. By 7 April, they answer the question
5. We post and archive the answer.

## About our volunteer

* Name: Kushin
* Lineage: Rinzai Zen
* Length of Formal Practice: Since 1996
* Background: B.S. in math/physics
* Occupation: Hermit

Anything you'd like to pick Kushin's brain about? Now's your chance! This should be particularly interesting, since we don't get to hear a Rinzai perspective on things very often.

----
**UPDATE** Let's focus our questions on Zen and Zen practice rather than the volunteer herself.  See [her disclaimer](http://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/1bd6d6/studenttostudent_event_kushins_disclaimer/) for more thoughts on this.

~~**UPDATE 2** A bit more background information from Kushin:~~

**UPDATE 3 (3 Apr)** Full disclaimer from Kushin follows (I previously copied over only the background info):

----

I honestly don't remember why past-me volunteered for this. It's not like me at all. For much of the last 3 years I've lived as a hermit with a couple of dogs. I started redditing 6 years ago and it's become my primary source of human interaction.

For many reasons, I want this student-to-student event to focus as much as possible on Zen, Buddhism and closely related subjects like meditation and not at all on me or my habits, experiences, background and so on. I think it's interesting to do it this way in order to take advantage of the unusual opportunity reddit affords to have our comments judged only on the merit of their contents, free from bias generated by knowing someone has titles, degrees, or other credentials implying authority. This seems especially valuable when talking about Zen because from that perspective we are all absolutely equal in terms of our ability to have direct contact with reality and a man of no rank may be taken more seriously than a king.

This said, please don't hold back from questioning my answers; that's precisely what this is for. As I answer your questions, I will be exposing my current mistakes to the community. If people are able to point these out and kind enough to help me overcome them, I will be immensely grateful and consider this event a great success.

Zen master Chao-Chou said “if a 7-year old boy knows more than I, I will learn from him and if a venerable elder understands less, I will teach him.” In this spirit, please ask me questions about the Dharma. If, at the end of the answering period on April 7th, after exposure to my views on Zen, people still want to know about me and my spiritual journey, I'll do an AMA and keep this as my permanent username.

**This is all I'm going to say about myself:**

I was ordained a lay nun in the Rinzai lineage in 2006 after 4 years of residency at a Zen Center in N. America (and 10 yrs as a student) but I'm not a respectable member of the clergy and apologize in advance to anyone who feels ripped off. I was told to leave the Zen Center a bit less than a year after ordination because my teacher thought I was beginning to have too much trouble with the hierarchical nature of the situation. Even though I was very sincere and painfully earnest, this was not completely untrue. After 4 years of hard labor and intensive meditation practice I was no longer a happy camper and telling me to go in no uncertain terms was the best thing my teacher could have done. It was intensely painful at the time and for a long while after I had no idea what to do with myself or how to put together a lay life. It took years before I was able to appreciate the importance of independence.

I have a deep love for Zen, Buddhism and reddit and hope these student-to-student discussions become regular events. Gassho!

1361133683.0,39,self.zen,18phyt,I am not a Zen student: my position on anti-intellectualism,NotOscarWilde,57,18,230,http://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/18phyt/i_am_not_a_zen_student_my_position_on/,"First things first: this is not Zen. This will be about Zen, however. About the Western Zen, how I see it, and where I am now. This is going to be a lot about how I wandered around Buddhism. Maybe you see things differently; in fact, you most likely do, since you frequent this forum.

What drew me to Buddhism? I became a vegetarian quite soon in my adult life, for ethical reasons. After asking hard questions about life and faith, Buddhism seemed to be the nicest religion of the bunch, with plenty of middle paths, forgiveness, tolerance and not harming others in it.

What pushed me from Buddhism to Zen? The religious aspects of Buddhism. Reincarnation, mostly -- it has much scientific merit as creationism does, and I don't see how I could accept that or many other notions of levels of Hell, Heaven and not mentioning the abundance of ghosts. I can see where they come from (I live in a country with a rich folklore fiction too), but I like to keep my fantasy and beliefs separate.

Buddhism, as I see it, will always be somewhat tied to the Indo-Tibetan region and as such it will attract many people who whole-heartedly accept the supernatural. And when I've met people who either looked for supernatural powers of Buddhas and masters or sought good fortune and other impossible things from Buddhism, I moved away from Zen.

Zen, for example Soto, but other sects too, do not care very much about the supernatural and the religious aspects that other Buddhist sects emphasize a bit more. However, as a cultural product of Asian philosophy, it has been influenced by other schools of thought too, most notably its strong anti-intellectual tendencies, which most likely came from Taoism.

Now, I have occasionally been a teacher. Not a Buddhist teacher, an ordinary teacher. I taught (as an assistant) at a university, I did extra-curricular programs for high schoolers, and more. And I've been a student almost all of my life. And what do I liked both as a teacher and as a student? *Clarity.* The most important thing for a teacher is to explain the material clearly, consisely, without arrogance or smugness. And that is where in my opinion Zen fails tremendously.

That doesn't mean there is no teacher of Zen that tries hard to do this right; several come to mind. However, the notion of anti-intellectualism and trying to find some truth ""beyond"" thinking is present in all koans, in most teachings, and I find it absurd.

And speaking frankly, I find this argument to be very close to what other religions are using. If Christians want to dispel the evidence about the evolution or the history of gays on this planet, what do they use? If Muslims want to back up their notions of marriage, what do they say? Usually, they do not refer to reasoning, they refer to either Holy Books or to God himself -- something beyond critical thinking, beyond arguments, something that cannot be disproved or touched (and is, according to them, true).

Hogwash, I say. Hogwash to anti-intellectualism everywhere. If two Zen monks are having a debate and the one to first say ""we have had enough discussion, let's have a cup of tea"" is always the wiser one, I'll eat my hat.

It could very well be that at one point in history, that has been the right answer, especially if the other person uses no better arguments (such as threats). But students like you and me, I don't think we understand it that way. We think a ridiculous answer is good every time, because Zen must transcend the ordinary, thinking mind. Thirty pounds of flax! I smash you with a stick! ""This is not Zen! What is Zen? Kah!""

Do you think I doubt I'll get several such answers in the comments section? Not at all. It's the way you've grown to think about Zen, and maybe that is Zen, what do I know. But this is what pushed me away from Zen and especially from most of its Western form today. I'll still eat when I'm hungry, sleep when I'm tired, and I'll sit when I have time.

But I am not a Zen student because I value clear, critical thinking and I believe most of what I find good and useful in Zen can be taught clearly, without any smugness, without any contradictory claims.

This anecdote, however, has given many a pupil the sickness of formality. If one truly understands, he will wash out his mouth for three days after saying the word Buddha, and he will close his ears and flee after hearing ""This mind is Buddha.""

Synopsis:

A fifth-century Indian Buddhist monk, Bodhidharma is credited with bringing Zen to China. Although the tradition that traces its ancestry back to him did not flourish until nearly two hundred years after his death, today millions of Zen Buddhists and students of kung fu claim him as their spiritual father. 

While others viewed Zen practice as a purification of the mind or a stage on the way to perfect enlightenment, Bodhidharma equated Zen with buddhahood and believed that it had a place in everyday life. Instead of telling his disciples to purify their minds, he pointed them to rock walls, to the movements of tigers and cranes, to a hollow reed floating across the Yangtze.

This bilingual edition, the only volume of the great teacher's work currently available in English, presents four teachings in their entirety. ""Outline of Practice"" describes the four all-inclusive habits that lead to enlightenment, the ""Bloodstream Sermon"" exhorts students to seek the Buddha by seeing their own nature, the ""Wake-up Sermon"" defends his premise that the most essential method for reaching enlightenment is beholding the mind. The original Chinese text, presented on facing pages, is taken from a Ch'ing dynasty woodblock edition.

I've added a link to the side bar that takes you to the current book we're reading, where as mentioned I will aggregate posts based by chapter, or however we break out the reading.

All are welcome to read along!

**Edit** Good day all. Tomorrow we'll start reading The Zen Teaching of Bodhidharma. My thought is to give Monday - Saturday to everyone for reading. Wednesday I'll open up a discussion post and everyone is free to come and go as they will. If you haven't finished the pages, no worries, the posts will be there for when you finish.

**Please Read: Introduction, Outline of Practice**

**Next week we'll read the Bloodstream Sermon**

**Lastly, if anyone has experience with the book and wants to suggest a better way of segmenting reading, I'm all ears!**

Imagine you have a glass of water with some sand in it. You put a spoon in the glass and you stir the water. What happens? The water becomes cloudy with the sand and things are unclear. This is what our daily life is. Doing things, wishing for things, wanting this or that outcome, being angry, being happy, being sad, being overjoyed, this is all stirring the water. And it doesn't matter if the grain of sand is filthy, or if it's shiny, or if it looks like the Buddha's face as they say or if it looks like God. It doesn't matter if the grain of sand looks like our political beliefs, or our love life, or our job, or our children, or enlightenment. It's all sand. This is our metaphor for the mind.

In sitting, what do we do? We stop stirring. Each grain of sand, no matter what it looks like- a disgusting thing, or a beautiful thing, or a spiritual thing, or an everyday thing. Each grain of sand settles. They all settle and the water becomes clear. This is a clarity beyond happiness or sadness or calmness or anger. This clarity puts to rest questions of politics or religion or the human condition. This a clarity like the sky; it includes all but depends on nothing. This is just clarity of mind.

It seems to me, however, that there is a characteristic western worldview that I would like to try and explain, and see what r/zen thinks.  As I said before, though, I'm not an expert on this, so really this is just my rough, amateurish, and misleading interpretation.  It is really just my impression.

If you read Plato, he makes a big distinction between the rational, unchanging, non-sensible ""world of forms/ideas"" and the chaotic, always changing ""world of appearance"" which confronts our senses day to day and moment to moment.  The world of appearance, which seems very real to us, is in fact just shadows cast by the world of forms.

Aristotle came soon after and had a different perspective.  For him there was only one world, the world that we see, but it possesses form.  Every object you encounter has matter and form.  The form of an object determines what it is at a given moment, its matter determines its potential.  So what makes a chair a chair is its shape, for example.  But that chair may, in the future, become firewood, because it is made of wood.

For this reason Aristotle says that matter is potentiality, form actuality.  Pure matter, devoid of form, would then be pure potentiality, and thus cannot actually exist.

Aristotle believed that there were four causal aspects to any change an object undergoes, the most interesting of which was the ""final cause"" of an object.  According to Aristotle, every object has an ideal which it tends toward.

Later Aquinas would amplify this idea.  At the end of the day, everything in the world is drawn towards God, and the vision he has for it.  The soup of matter, mere non-existent potentiality, is drawn toward God, whose existence is so pure and beautiful that it draws material beings into existence, causing them to take on shape and form as they move towards their final perfection.  

I for myself wonder what this could be--to be perfected is to no longer admit change, and this is to cease being material. So what is the state of perfection--that of an empty form, like a mathematical triangle or circle?

In any event, western philosophy soon moved on, or so it seemed.  Descartes opened the door to skepticism about whether we can know such things at all.  The focus shifts inward, and we start wondering whether or not anything we experience is really real at all.  Eventually Immanuel Kant comes along and says that the form we see in the world we live in is all imposed by the mind.  It is the subject of consciousness which gives shape and form to the objects it experiences as a precondition for them to be experienced at all.  The ""thing in itself"" the world as it exists outside consciousness, is then necessarily formless and without shape.

Arthur Schopenhauer then comes along and says more or less this, but says more:  the thing in itself is will, which is what we feel as desire or what it feels like to move one's arm.

The physical world that we experience is then simply the mind's representation of this inner will which in fact underlies all things, not just our own bodies.  So when I get angry the mind of nearby people constructs a carbon based creature with four limbs making loud noises to represent that.  When I get horny the mind of the woman (and my own mind) constructs a boner and dilated pupils.  When I feel sad, tears.  You get the idea.

Of course, if this understanding of the world is correct, then there is no need for God.  The true source of movement and change is instead the will, which is like a stormy sea.  Life is futile, and without any deeper purpose.  Your body and brain are just specs of form, representations of one little cresting wave of will.  Soon enough the wave crashes and the individual dissipates.

Assuming this to be the case, what does Schopenhauer recommend?  Detaching one's self from the will.  Learn to stop wanting things, stop feeling things, stop being the will.  Become merely a mirror, pure subject of consciousness, perhaps just a pure form representing nothing?  Of course you can't actually do this but you should try.

Nietzsche then comes along and essentially buys into Schopenhauer's metaphysics completely.  God was indeed already dead when Nietzsche came on the scene.  But, if like Schopenhauer you reject the will as something evil then you are rejecting life and everything that exists as evil too.  This is something he cannot accept.  Still, he sees that the will manifests itself by filling the world with suffering and cruelty, among other things.  So he chooses to embrace even this aspect of it.  Paradoxically, I think it was out of love that he embraced suffering and cruelty--he saw this as the only way to escape an otherwise inevitable nihilism and hatred for existence itself.

After Nietzsche western philosophy seems more or less to have slowly melted away.

1.  *On the Zen and Nihilism discussion*; ""Thus it should be obvious that the ""naturalness"" of these T'ang masters is not to be taken just literally, as if Zen were merely to glory in being a completely ordinary, vulgar fellow who scatters ideas to the wind and behaves as he pleases - for this would in itself be an affectation.  The 'naturalness' of Zen flourishes only when one has lost affectedness and self-consciousness of every description.""

2.  *On the Practicing Zen discussion*; [Quote from Chu Ch'an] ""In these days, people only seek to stuff themselves with knowledge and deductions, placing great reliance on written explanations and calling all this the practice.""

3.  *On the discussion of translating ""Mu""*; ""When Chao-chou [Joshu] was asked whether a dog has a Buddha nature - which is certainly the usual Mahayana doctrine - he gave the one word 'No!' (Wu, Japanese Mu)""  

4.  *On monks taking vows*; [around 700-800 C.E.] ""It might be remarked here that these are not exactly monasteries in the Western sense.  They are rather training schools, from which one is free to depart at any time without censure.""  [After 800 C.E] ""The effect of [accepting boys into monastic communities] on institutional Zen can hardly be underestimated.  For the Zen community became less an association of mature men with spiritual interests, and more of an ecclesiastical boarding school for adolescent boys... The mature Western student who discovers an interest in Zen as a philosophy or as a way of liberation must be careful to keep this in mind, for otherwise he may be unpleasantly startled by monastic Zen as it exists today in Japan... He will find... its main preoccupation is with a disciplinary regimen which ""trains character"" in the same way as the old-fashioned British public school or the Jesuit novitiate.""  

1. *On mental discipline*; ""... a person is not genuinely free, detached, or pure when his state is the result of an artificial discipline.  He is just imitating purity, just 'faking' clear awareness.  Hence the unpleasant self-righteousness of those who are deliberately and methodically religious.""

Just that they are different. On ZF, people post lots of nonsense. This can be entertaining and confusing. It is a different way of working with the dharma. I have been reading these forums for a number of years, but never made a post until today. One thing I've noticed is that people have been talking about ewk for many years (at least 3?). I don't have a comment on that. Not good, not bad, just the way things are.

I've also noticed that sometimes there seems to be less compassion on ZF than in ZSIRL. This might just be because it's easier to detect compassion IRL, but over the years reading this forum, I've seen a lot of people trying to develop and display their wisdom, and less people trying to develop their compassion. I don't think the two are really separable. 

I also see lots of good posts on here. I also see lots of anger and antagonism.

In ZSIRL there is less nonsense. Maybe because IRL people have feelings like shame and guilt which are much stronger when sitting in a room full of adult human beings, especially when in the presence of a ""zen master"" and elder practitioners. There is a very tangible energy you can feel when sitting with ZSIRL. I don't feel similar energy when looking at ZF on reddit.

In real life there is love and respect amongst members of the sangha, and honest discussion about life and zen practice. Also I have noticed some ZSIRL nowadays tend to emphasize Mahayana stuff and the importance of being a functional member of society. Often the measure of one's practice is not ""how many koans did I solve"" or ""how good is my dharma sword"" but rather, ""Do the people in my life (family, co-workers, etc.) seem to think I am a nicer, more patient and compassionate person? Do I seem to be getting along better in the world than I did in the past?""

Because who gives a fuck how much wisdom you have in your head? The only thing that matters is how you act in the world.

*Note -- Take this all with a grain of salt. I just wrote it down from my mind and I'm not going to go back and revise it. My experience with zen comes from many years of sitting and a few years of being part of sanghas, attending sesshin, living in monasteries.

Sometimes I feel agitated by things, and I wish the agitation away, but for a little while it remains as my mind attempts to sort something out. I like the idea of giving my mind just a bit more space without pushing or pulling on it so intensely to stop.

I can give space for things to be as they are, but that includes my agitation. It seems as I allow myself to be agitated, it resolves itself and fades naturally like the agitation of the birds and squirrels.

The world often protests, people often protest, and to the degree that I allow this protesting to be what it is, I no longer feel opposed to it, and this feels so relieving.

1. Family (and all that goes into supporting it).

Hey, fair enough (even if I'd question whether or not Zen can be called a religion).  But I'd love to be able to explain to her why the Great Way has taken such a place of importance in my life.

The book is composed of both dialogues and lectures.

Huang Po argues against specific Buddhist practices as well as Theravada, Mahayana, and Taoism generally.  The strongest summary of this is:

&gt; ""From the days when Bodhidharma first transmitted naught but the One Mind, there has been no other valid Dharma.""

Huang Po is very specific at times, perhaps because we have so much of him on record.  While he wanders in and out of Buddhist and Taoist imagery and language one passage in particular stands out as a consolidation of several phrases he repeats throughout the book:

&gt; ""Were you now to practice keeping your minds motionless at all times, whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying; concentrating entirely upon the goal of no thought-creation, no duality, no reliance on others and no attachments; just allowing all things to take their course the whole day long, as though you were to ill to bother; unknown to the world; innocent of any urge to be known or unknown to others; with your minds like blocks of stone that mend no holes - then all the Dharmas would penetrate your understanding through and through.""

Huang Po emphasizes the sudden quality of Zen enlightenment, in one example comparing it to a ""knife-thrust.""  His most consistent refrain is that there is nothing to attain and even as he lectures he repeats that he has nothing to teach.

If you enjoyed Mumonkan or the Platform Sutra, this book offers an intriguing middle ground between the two.   

&gt; ""So it is said that if you have the merest intention to indulge in conceptual thinking, behold, your very intention will place you in the clutch of demons.  Similarly, a conscious lack of such intention, or even a consciousness that you do not have no such intention, will be sufficient to deliver you into the demons' power.""

.

&gt; ""Thus, though Gautama Buddha preached for forty-nine years, in truth no word was spoken.""

.

An anecdote related by Huang Po, regarding Kuei Tsung:

&gt; Monk: I intend to visit all the places where the five kinds of Zen are taught.

&gt; Kuei Tsung: Other places may have five kinds; here we have only the one.

1353088248.0,30,self.zen,13b3xe,On the state of this subreddit,,37,7,72,http://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/13b3xe/on_the_state_of_this_subreddit/,"So -- maybe it’s just my confused projections and assumptions, but it seems to me like there’s something going on with this subreddit that might be called something like a “problem” or “issue,” if one were so inclined.

I think it’s very interesting, and sort of crazy.

The other day at work, two of my coworkers got into sort of a fight. That doesn’t happen often -- we’re civilized professionals, and mostly cheerful. So when it does happen, it’s surprising. I had honestly forgotten that people even have it in them -- vindictiveness, mean-spiritedness, purposeful misunderstanding, and so on. An outburst of energy!

Now, I don’t really know what a subreddit is. I don’t have it in me from birth or culture -- it’s a novel phenomenon, and one might say we, together, are always sort of inventing what it is, shifting the definition, evolving a culture, and so on.

There are many “actors” in a subreddit, playing their parts. There’s a moderator, a bunch of accounts posting comments in threads, a stream of links and self-posts, upvotes and downvotes, CSS styling, etc. I’ve always found it interesting how these kinds of technological and cultural things shape conversations and behaviors.

There may be several people using one account, or one person might use several accounts. Some of the accounts are even run by robots. Some people posting might be little kids, some are old geezers, and everyone has a unique personality, everyone has different mind states, backgrounds, vocabularies, and -- perhaps most crucially -- intentions.

I’m just trying to set the scene here -- we’re talking about an actual online community, something roughly comparable to a village, a club, a monastery, or some other community.

For me, since I frequent a certain Zen center, that comparison is close at hand. And the most prominent difference between this community and the Zen center I go to is that at the Zen center, almost nobody talks about Zen or Buddhism in any kind of serious way. Mostly there’s joking around, smalltalk, and the occasional personal stuff. But you get the sense that people there, outside of actual formal practice and certain scheduled “Dharma Discussions,” have some aversion towards actually discussing Zen. This is “neither good nor bad” -- but it’s interesting.

The Korean Zen Master Seung Sahn had a koan-like question he liked to ask people. It’s this: suppose you’re in the Zen Center, and someone comes into the zendo with a lit cigarette, goes up to the altar, and drops ashes on the statue of the Buddha. What do you do? He’s a strong person and somewhat well-versed in Zen to boot.

I think one interesting way to think about that question is to take it as a hypothetical -- actually imagine that it happens. What do you do? Does this reveal anything about your relationship to “Zen?” Does it make you feel anything in particular? And so on. The question can be used to investigate your own reactions, thoughts, attachments, personality, and so on.

Now, I have another question that may be easier to imagine. Suppose someone comes into an online Zen community and keeps saying over and over again, with no ifs and buts, that “Zen is not meditation,” “Zen doesn’t require meditation,” “Zen Masters warned against meditation,” “Zen is not about kindness,” and so on. Further, this person seems relatively well-versed in the Zen jargon and the history of Zen, and uses a large number of quotes and sayings from ancient Zen masters. He or she displays an unusual stubbornness and inquisitiveness.

How do you react? Why? What happens to you? How do you respond?

Looking at the reader counts and comparing to the number of people who actively talk and discuss, there’s quite a few people who react in ways that don’t involve writing comments. Maybe some people just sit and laugh. Maybe there are some lurkers who get so angry they go through several keyboards every week just reading these infuriating remarks, but without ever commenting. Maybe some people are just confused and don’t see what the big deal is. There’s a lot of different ways to react.

For me, one thing I always like to do when dealing with people, is to consciously keep trying to let go of my own assumptions and views. I find that this helps me hear what other people say with less interference from prejudices, old emotions, and whatever else. People change, people have different moods, I change and go through moods, and if I don’t do something to look beyond the conditioned patterns of understanding, I get caught up in stupid self-perpetuating stuff.

Of course, this is also a “spiritual practice,” not just a way of furthering interpersonal communication. I don’t know if it’s Zen or not. But I think it might help this place become more conducive for understanding.

""Tomorrow,"" the Zen swordsman said, ""when you duel the soldier, hold your weapon above your head, as if ready to strike, and face him with the same concentration and tranquility with which you perform the tea ceremony.""

The next day, at the appointed time and place for the duel, the tea master followed this advice. The soldier, readying himself to strike, stared for a long time into the fully attentive but calm face of the tea master.

Finally, the soldier lowered his sword, apologized for his arrogance, and left without a blow being struck.",,False,,t5_2qhmf,False,,,True,t3_dyb5h,http://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/dyb5h/tea_combat/,

2. Anything that you are asked to keep secret is of more
value to the teacher than to the student.

3. Any practice that is forbidden offers something that the

&amp;nbsp;

Unborn and imperishable

Is the original mind

Earth, water, fire and wind

A temporary lodging for the night

&amp;nbsp;

Attached to this

Ephemeral burning house

You yourselves light the fire, kindle the flames

In which you're consumed

&amp;nbsp;

Keep your mind as it was

When you came into the world

And instantly this very self

Is a living ""thus-come"" one

&amp;nbsp;

Ideas of

What's good, what's bad

All due to

This self of yours

&amp;nbsp;

In winter, a bonfire

Spells delight

But when summertime arrives

What a nuisance it becomes!

&amp;nbsp;

And the breezes

You loved in summer

Even before the autumn's gone

Already have become a bother

&amp;nbsp;

Throwing your whole life away

Sacrificed to the thirst for gold

But when you saw your life was through

All your money was no use

&amp;nbsp;

Clinging, craving and the like

I don't have them on my mind

That's why nowadays I can say

The whole world is truly mine!

&amp;nbsp;

Since, after all this floating world

Is unreal

Instead of holding onto things in

Your mind, go and sing!

&amp;nbsp;

Only original mind exists

In the past and in the future too

Instead of holding onto things in

Your mind, let them go!

&amp;nbsp;

Having created

the demon mind yourself

When it torments you mercilessly

You're to blame and no one else

&amp;nbsp;

When you do wrong

our mind's the demon

There's no hell

To be found outside

&amp;nbsp;

Abominating hell

Longing for heaven

You make yourself suffer

In a joyful world

&amp;nbsp;

You think that good

Means hating what is bad

What's bad is

The hating mind itself

&amp;nbsp;

Fame, wealth, eating and

drinking, sleep and sensual delight —

Once you've learned the Five Desires

They become

Your guide in life

&amp;nbsp;

Notions of what one should do

Never existed from the start

Fighting about what's right, what's wrong

That's the doing of the ""I""

&amp;nbsp;

When your study

Of Buddhism is through

You find

You haven't anything new

&amp;nbsp;

If you think the mind

That attains enlightenment

Is ""mine""

Your thoughts will wrestle, one with the other

&amp;nbsp;

These days I'm not bothering about

Getting enlightenment all the time

And the result is

I wake up in the morning feeling fine!

&amp;nbsp;

Praying for salvation in the world to come

Praying for your own selfish ends

Is only piling on more and more

Self-centeredness and arrogance

&amp;nbsp;

Die — then live

Day and night within the world

Once you've done this, then you can

Hold the world right in your hand!

&amp;nbsp;

If you search for the Pure Land

Bent upon your own reward

You'll only find yourself

despised

By the Buddha after all!

&amp;nbsp;

People have no enemies

None at all right from the start

You create them all yourself

Fighting over right and wrong

&amp;nbsp;

Clear are the workings of cause

and effect

You become deluded, but

don't know

It's something that you've done yourself

That's what's called self-centeredness

&amp;nbsp;

Though the years may creep ahead

Mind itself can never age

This mind that's

Always just the same

&amp;nbsp;

Wonderful! Marvelous!

When you've searched

and found at last

The one who never will grow old

— ""I alone!""

&amp;nbsp;

The Pure Land

Where one communes at peace

Is here and now, it's not remote

Millions and millions of leagues away

&amp;nbsp;

When someone tosses you a tea bowl

— Catch it!

Catch it nimbly with soft cotton

With the cotton of your skillful mind!

Every Zen master that ever lived served their lives primarily as meditation teachers.  Sure, there were a few lay people who wandered around, poets like Ikkyu, etc. but the masters we read so much about here had jobs.  And their job was to run a dojo or to assist in running a dojo and a dojo is historically a *meditation center*.  

There has never been a Zen master who was not deeply involved in the daily practice of meditation.  To say otherwise is frankly, bullshit.  

When a master would say that meditation was pointless, the next day, they would go back and sit, with everybody else, at the dojo.  This is history... 

These guys provoked people into having deep realizations by pushing them hard to challenge everything, including meditation itself.  But when we take these provocations out of context and assume they are writ, we are completely mistaken.  

**EDIT: 
A simple test as to whether your favorite Zen master taught meditation:**

* Take a Zen master. Look him up in Wikipedia. 
* Where did he teach? If he taught, he taught or directed meditation sessions.  
* What monasteries did he direct?  If he directed a monastery he taught meditation.
* Does his portrait have him in robes? If his portrait has him in robes - than he was a monk and he assisted in teaching meditation.


**A couple of basic facts about monastic life:**

* Monasteries were not taverns where dudes came and went while they engaged in Dharma combat.
* There were strict rules regarding every aspect of your life, work, alcohol, women, etc.  
* Monasteries were strictly controlled by the Chinese and Japanese Feudal Lords.  They got donations and tax breaks and the right to beg in town.  
* Every Zen monastery has a strict schedule; all monks engaged in hard work, and the monks meditated for 2 or 3 hours a day.

I've been a sporadic reader of reddit for a while and it just occurred to me a week or so ago to look into what this vast site had to offer in the way of zen subreddits.

I was curious what people might be up to in a forum about this thing I spend a considerable amount of time on.

I have to say that if I came here as someone new to zen I wouldn't be too enthusiastic about jumping in to practise with a community if I figured this is what would be waiting for me.

As you may be aware, I've been hoping to expand the moderator team for some time now, and eventually retire at some point when I feel the community is being taken care of.  But with some controversy around Ewk a couple months back, I thought it wouldn't be very nice of me to hand things over as an implicit “now it's your problem!”   

So in the hopes of making some sort of stance, here are some thoughts on how /r/zen moderation currently works.  New mods can decide for themselves to adopt this approach or depart from it, but in either case, it would be useful to lay out where it currently stands.

## Goals of this Reddit

I think of /r/zen as having 3 goals, in order of importance:

1. vitality: to be a lively place to discuss Zen from a diverse set of perspectives
2. quality: to have content which is interesting, thoughtful, new, etc
3. authenticity: to be faithful to authentic Zen tradition

One way or another, whatever I do is an attempt to further these goals, but the main goal I tend to favour most is that of a thriving community even to some extent at the expense of one that promotes “correct” Zen practice.  More on this later.

## Relaxed moderation…

You may have seen me use the ecosystem metaphor before, in the sense I tend to think of moderation as partly about allowing some kind of balance in a community (prey may not like predators, but the latter can be good for the former).  Aside from the sense of balance, this “ecosystems” perspective is one that tends more towards the pragmatic than idealistic. In other words, I'm moderating towards a set of goals rather than an elevated set of ideals (eg. “freedom of spech”), and what I'm after is the overall health of the community.  Things that would be seen as potential damage to the community might be

- users being driven away
- people tending more to lurk than participate
- narrower or homogenous range of viewpoints
- generating lots and lots of drama or meta-talk

This attitude makes the moderation style rather light: I will tend to fairly laissez-faire about problematic behaviours that forum mods may generally frown upon (unpleasantness, attacks, etc), tending to ignore them so long as I think the overall community is fairly robust.  I will sometimes intervene if I feel things are getting out of hand, but not because I think verbal abuse is inherently bad (or ax-grinding, etc), but because I start to feel the overall community is being damaged.  

Interventions themselves will tend to be soft. I'll most likely try to have a quiet word with the relevant party and see if we can come to a solution. The attitude is basically to try and address behaviours rather than people.  It doesn't mean the heavy artillery is off limits (bans, etc); just that I'd rather keep it stowed away as much as possible.

In any case, if you want moderator intervention, you're more likely to succeed by aligning yourself with moderator goals.  In other words, arguments based on practical issues or overall community health issues are more likely to receive sympathy than arguments based on what the other person has to say.  What is more likely to get a response is something like “so and so is shutting down the discussion by arguing incessantly with everybody until nobody can be bothered” than “so and so is being rude/arrogant/wrong about Zen”.  

## But with a little bias

So I've established my main priorities for the community as preserving its vitality/diversity and my prefered moderation style as being very minimalistic.  At the same time, I want to make sure I'm transparent about my own biases and agenda.  It ties back to the secondary and tertiary moderation goals.

Quality: I'd be a bit sad to see /r/zen descend to a stream of lovely Zen thoughts/pictures, or self-help tips for example. I don't have a definitive guide for what is quality or not, just a rough idea that some content is a bit fluffier or more vacuous than others. For now I've left this well alone, only blocking outright spam.  If thing started to get out of hand, I might start to intervene a bit more (with a bit of advance notice and negotiating with the community, of course!).

Authenticity: We all have different ideas about what constitutes authentic Zen. Ewk for example would point at the Mumonkan and the Old Men; whereas I would be more likely to look at formal Zen practice in a traditional lineage. Yet somewhere I do think some things are likely to be more universally recognised as authentic than others… that we want more Dharma and less Dharma Burger. This has been a tricky one for me to sort out because I really don't want to establish myself as an arbitrer of Zen authenticity nor do I want to turn this into some kind of theocrary.  

## And an agenda

Basically, my agenda with respect to authenticity is to ensure that traditional/formal Zen practice gets some representation in the lovely wide pool of ideas we have here.  It doesn't matter what lineage, and it doesn't even have to dominant.  The hope here is to make sure that it has some kind of audible voice on this forum.  I recognise however that I may very well be wrong about what constitutes authentic Zen, which is why I want to be careful to pursue this agenda in a fairly soft manner:  the use of lineage flair to increase the visibility of formal zen practice, (hopefully!) the introduction of the Student to Student Sessions (it turns out Zen monks are a fairly busy lot).  I've said before that I think of the moderation job as having four parts (sanitation, infrastructure, animation, and management); and the pursuit of this agenda is essentially through the infrastucture/animation side of things.

So that's my agenda, not a very actively pursued one, but it's there. But I'll stress that this sort of thing really is secondary for me and the key goal is to work towards a sense of healthy diversity in the community, and want to take a principled stance that moderation should not be about pushing one understanding of Zen over another or stifling alternative points of view.  Softly softly.

## Future moderators

Finally, a word about future moderators.  I'm still recruiting.  Have some candidates in mind, but need to check if they're still interested.   I am going to try and prefer growing the team towards folks who are engaged in a formal practice, ideally from a broad range of lineages.  Will hopefully looking for people who may have compatible goals for this Reddit.  Not necessarily the same, mind you!  I'm sure future moderators will take things in a different direction, for example by opening to a wider pool of mods from the formal communities.  But one thing at a time.

----

**TL;DR**: 

1. vitality &gt; quality &gt; authenticity
2. moderators are not babysitters
3. Eric a bit biased towards formal Zen

**Reaching enlightenment**

Nasreddin was walking in the bazaar with a large group of followers. Whatever Nasreddin did, his followers immediately copied. Every few steps Nasreddin would stop and shake his hands in the air, touch his feet and jump up yelling ""Hu Hu Hu!"". So his followers would also stop and do exactly the same thing.
    
One of the merchants, who knew Nasreddin, quietly asked him: 

""What are you doing my old friend? Why are these people imitating you?""

""I have become a Sufi Sheikh,"" replied Nasreddin. ""These are my Murids (spiritual seekers); I am helping them reach enlightenment!""

""How do you know when they reach enlightenment?""

i didn't get into zen buddhism because i was looking for anything specific. i'm a curious person and i like to know how things work. so when i stumbled upon meditation, which quickly led me to buddhism, i had to know ""why?"" and for no other reason i started down the path...or as i like to think, jumped in.

i saw that despite how real something appears, it's bullshit. and despite being total bullshit, it's completely real. i learned that there is no beginning and no end to this, or anything. if it exists, it exists. and if it doesn't, it doesn't. and that's it. there is no in-between. and that encouraged me to let go of whether it was bullshit or real or both or neither.

i experienced an intuitive nature to life. inherent nature exists in everything and it can't be measured. i learned that any measurement, for that matter, is arbitrary. what's right? what's wrong? everything. and nothing.

i felt myself as a reflection of everything. that consciousness is a sum greater than it's parts. that the same could be said for anything. and when we follow it all back we find an unexplainable nothing. and that nothing is somehow everything.

i've learned that doesn't make sense. and that words are essential, but ultimately mere tools. they hold no mystery or power unto themselves. and anything that can be learned is not worth knowing unless you know that simple fact.

and, a lot more. at times, it felt like i was being thrown down a white water rapid, frequently smashing head-on into rocks and being scrapped along the bottom. 

things have calmed down recently, and i'm looking forward to year two. the rapids have transitioned into a placid ocean (at least for now). the land which i once had to have my feet secured to at all times is beginning to disappear over the horizon. and think i'm ok with that, because i think i have everything i need right here.

so here, a year later, i've come so far, but i haven't moved an inch. nothing has changed, yet it all feels different.

Death is one of the few things in reality I can feel is as real as my own skin and awareness. I can look back to my earliest memory in life, and see before that, there was a void. And yet I miraculously came out of that void. We all know this. We can feel that endless mystery, and that's where were going back to. Probably. Most likely.

So I don't feel so bad about it. Only an attachment to all things which is this current life, and the fear of losing them, is what could make me fear death.

I have lost so many things. Relatives. Pets. Two lovers. Items. Feelings. Memories. And there will be many things to be lost still, culminating with the loss of my own life.

But does it have to be a bad thing? The only constant in life is change itself. If we can become comfortable with change, death is no problem.

I thought it was about time I took my own medicine.  So here it is:

    
It is what it is.  Everything going on before we speak about it, think about it, or otherwise add to it.

Thinking about it, adding to it, talking about it, is itself as much ""it"" as anything else.  But you can't point to what it is, because it is just what it is.  

Pointing to Zen is just pointing to Zen, not Zen.  Talking about Zen is just talking about Zen, not Zen.  Meditating is just meditating.  Zazen is Zazen.  

You can't get any closer to what is through any method, because it is there before you decided to start.  You can't define it, because by defining something, you are drawing a circle around something and leaving other things out.  If you draw a circle around everything, you are omitting not-everything, which is something too.

It is like acknowledging there is nothing to do, before you make the acknowledgement.  You can't find it, because it is already there.  You can't escape it, because there is nothing to escape.  

At best, discussions can be pointing at something.  For instance, what I am currently writing is pointing, and pointing the wrong way, because it is the opposite of where I am pointing, outside of where I am pointing.  It includes where I am pointing, but that's about as good directions as pointing up in the air if someone asks you how to drive to Arkansas.

The best we can do is to just do what comes next.  But that will happen by itself anyhow.  

It is that, that is, when it just is.  It is.

A larger number of people seem to be extrovert, i.e having a literally physically programmed need for expressing and meeting many people, talking, doing things, being recharged by other people. It's just how their brain works.

The introverts are polar opposite, being recharged by being alone. They seem to be fewer in number.

Our western society has a preferred bias towards the extrovert - a person who is really outgoing and talkative is seen as something positive. The hermit is seen as strange, something to be avoided.

I can't help but think that the introvert has an advantage in spiritual matters, being naturally inclined to sit and ponder things and focus energy internally, not externally. To listen instead of talk.

 In India the hermit is a wise man, a man that has stopped to play the game of society and life.

I just noticed we've hit 10K subscribers in this reddit. Welcome to all the newcomers!

I think this may be the right time for us to start thinking about growing the moderator pool.  Right now there is only one active moderator (me), the other two being from sort of an older incarnation of the Reddit.

Basically there are four jobs I can think of:

* Sanitation - monitor the mod queue and get rid of spam
* Infrastructure - improve technical bits of this reddit (mostly messing around with CSS and some light HTML)
* Animation - run regular events like the Koan of the Month and the Student to Student sessions
* Management - set and enforce policies that are conducive to community health

If you think you might be able to help out, reply to this thread.  My basis for choosing the team is going to be a bit ill-defined.  I have a sort of rough idea what I'm looking for.  

* One thing I want, for example, is diversity of practices.  So I'm a Soto guy, but I'd love the mod team to include say Rinzai folks or people with a Chan background.  
* I also want a sort of inclusive attitude, ie. one that works towards the health of the community as a whole without trying to push one's view over another.  
* While I value inclusiveness, I would be more comfortable with mods that are engaged in some sort of long term formal Zen practice.  I realise not everybody in this community is into that sort of thing, which is absolutely fine — I still want /r/zen to be a good place for you to hang out too — but for this first tranche of new moderators, I'd like long-time-ish practitioners (data point: me 5y sitting w group, so I'm not expecting more than that, nor am I expecting any ordination, etc)
* That said, I would be interested in maybe growing the team to include people with a more muscular approach to moderation, something to complement my rather laissez-faire attitude (so people who may be willing to step in and draw the line where absolutely needed).  

It's a very rough picture I've painted above, and maybe I don't really know what I'm looking for in a mod until I've seen it, but if you think you might be a good fit, do step up!

&gt; Our nature is the mind. And the mind is our nature. This nature is the same as the mind of all Buddhas. Buddhas of the past and future only transmit this mind. Beyond this mind there’s no Buddha anywhere. But deluded people don’t realize that their own mind is the Buddha. They keep searching outside. They never stop invoking Buddhas or worshipping Buddhas and wondering Where is the buddha? Don’t indulge in such illusions. Just know your mind. Beyond your mind there’s no other Buddha. The sutras say, ""Everything that has form is an illusion."" They also say, ""Wherever you are, there’s a Buddha."" Your mind is the Buddha. Don’t use a Buddha to worship a Buddha.
&gt;
Even if a Buddha or bodhisattva should suddenly appear before you, there’s no need for reverence. This mind of ours is empty and contains no such form. Those who hold onto appearances are devils. They fall from the Path. Why worship illusions born of the mind? Those who worship don’t know, and those who know don’t worship. By worshipping you come under the spell of devils. I point this out because I'm afraid you’re unaware of it. The basic nature of a Buddha has no such form. Keep this in mind, even if something unusual should appear. Don’t embrace it, and don’t fear it, and don’t doubt that your Mind is basically pure. Where could there be room for any such form? Also, at the appearance of spirits, demons, or divine conceive neither respect nor fear. Your mind is basically empty. All appearances are illusions. Don’t hold on to appearances. If you envision a Buddha, a Dharma, or a bodhisattva and conceive respect for them, you relegate yourself to the realm of mortals. If you seek direct understanding, don’t hold on to any appearance whatsoever, and you’ll succeed. I have no other advice. The sutras say, ""All appearances are illusions."" They have no fixed existence, no constant form. They’re impermanent. Don’t cling to appearances and you’ll be of one mind with the Buddha. The sutras say, ""That which is free of all form is the Buddha.""
&gt;
But why shouldn’t we worship Buddhas and bodhisattvas?
&gt;
Devils and demons possess the power of manifestation. They can create the appearance of bodhisattvas in all sorts of guises. But they’re false. None of them are Buddhas. The Buddha is your own mind. Don’t misdirect your worship.
&gt;
Buddha is Sanskrit for what you call aware, miraculously aware. Responding, arching your brows blinking your eyes, moving your hands and feet, its all your miraculously aware nature. And this nature is the mind. And the mind is the Buddha. And the Buddha is the path. And the path is Zen. But the word Zen is one that remains a puzzle to both mortals and sages.

His worrying and meditation were disturbed when, as if in a test of his faith, ordure fell from the second floor onto him. At that time two people walked into the room.

Suzuki's book ""The Zen Doctrine of No-mind"" is mostly koans and parts of dialogues.  Much of it I've never come across before, which of course is delightful.  I left out everything I could and this is still rather long.

These next few are from a dialogue between a Hui-Chung (student of the Sixth) and one of his students, Ling-chiao. 

&gt;Q: The Buddha has wonderful ways and knows how to deliver all beings.  If he had no mind, who would ever deliver all beings?

&gt;A:  To have no mind means to deliver all beings.  If he sees any being who is to be delivered he has a mind, and is surely subject to birth and death.

When we ask ""What is Zen?"" we are at least asking about what these old men taught, the Patriarchs down through the Masters shown in all the lineage trees.  When we look at what is taught today by someone we can figure out if this is what the old men taught or something else.

Suzuki complicates this way of thinking a great deal.  The dialogue above suggests that the Buddhist compassion which drives the intent to deliver all sentient beings is no-mind, and seeing them as not needing to be delivered is delivering them.  Perhaps Suzuki thinks there is no Buddhism but Zen.  If compassion is no-mind and seeing no need to save anyone saves everyone, that sounds like Zen.  But does it sound like compassion to those that call themselves Buddhists?

&gt;A:""In no-mindedness there is no karma.""

&gt;A:""When I am hungry I eat, when I am cold I put on more cloths.""  

So that's where Bankei got it.

&gt;Q: The mind has no form.

&gt;A: If you already know that the mind has no form, that means that from the first the mind is not, and how could you talk about having a mind?

This is a snippet where the Monk began with a question and ended up getting answers in the form of a question which he then tried to answer.  It is interesting in koans and dialogues where monks think they have answer and where they don't.  

Now on to **Chih**.

&gt;Monk: If Self-nature is pure, and belongs to no categories of duality such as being and non-being, etc, where does this seeing take place?

&gt;Chih of Yun-chu: There is a seeing, but nothing seen.

&gt;Monk: If there is nothing seen, how can we say that there is any seeing at all?

&gt;Chih: In fact there is no trace of seeing.

&gt;Monk: In such a seeing, whose seeing is it?

&gt;Chih: There is no seer, either.

Well, he asked.  I'd like to buy this Chih person some lunch.


Suzuki says that Ling-chiao argued in a dialogue that Hui-neng's [Sixth Patriarch] followers had already revised the T'an-ching [Platform Sutra].  That would be within two generations of the Sixth.  How long did physical copies last back then?  Did monks bring their copies from home only to be told, ""That's last year's copy.""

&gt;**Chien-nin** of Chen-chou was another disciple of Ma-tsu (Baso).  When meal time came, Chien-nin carried the rice-holder himself to the dining room and performed a dance at the entrance, announcing aloud: ""O Bodhisattvas, come and eat your rice!  He then clapped his hands a gave a hearty laugh.  This is said to have continued for twenty years.  

&gt;Later a monk asked Chan-ching, ""What was the ancient master's idea when he danced, clapping his hands?""  Chan-ching said, ""It looks as if he were singing praises.""  Still later, another monk asked Tai-kuag, ""When Chang-ching refers to giving praises, to who are the praises given?""  Tai-kuang stood up and danced.  Thereupon the monk made bows.  Kuang remarked, ""What is the meaning of your bows?""  It was the monk that this time stood up and danced.  Kuang said, ""O you ghost of a wild fox.""

This is perhaps the older of the two foxes.

&gt;**Pai-ling** one day met P'ang, the lay-Buddhist, in the street.  Pai-ling said, ""Have you had the occasion to hold up to anyone the truth which you in olden days experience at Nan-yueh?""  P'ang replied, ""Yes, I have.""  Pai-ling, ""To whom?""  P'ang, pointing to himself, said, ""To this old man.""

Here is Seikan Čech's answer for our [latest student to student session](http://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/1j4a4z/student_to_student_5_seikan_%C4%8Dech_melbourne_zen/).  For those of us who have not been following the session, Seikan is a Zen monk and founder of the Melbourne Zen Centre and the Melbourne Zen Hospice.  In his answer, Seikan takes on a question about the [street zazen videos](http://youtu.be/XDsyEGD2CgE) sometimes posted online featuring him meditating in public places such as in front of fast food restaurants or train stations.

Thanks very much to Seikan for taking the time out to join in on our session, to /u/grass_skirt for suggesting him as a potential volunteer (more suggestions welcome!), and to all of you for joining in on the discussion.  Until next time! :-)

----
Thanks Eric for organizing this forum and for inviting me to take part in it. Thanks too to everybody who sent in questions or comments. I apologize for not being able to reply to each of you individually.
 
Reading through the range of questions and comments gave me a feeling somewhat like at an airport: with billboards showing destinations, travellers wheeling suitcases, different flights being announced, and planes ready to take off in various directions. Of course there is nothing wrong with travelling. However it is easy to become caught up in it. Going here, going there, always going somewhere. So special thanks to ‘[agentstartling](http://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/1j4a4z/student_to_student_5_seikan_%C4%8Dech_melbourne_zen/cbb6e8j)’ for reminding us all that there is no ticket to Zen.
 
&gt; I just want to say hello, I don't really want to ask anything :)
 
With this said, I will try to respond to the question and commentary by ‘[znvfoa](http://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/1j4a4z/student_to_student_5_seikan_%C4%8Dech_melbourne_zen/cbb8dz6)’ because it relates quite directly to something that I actually do. He writes:
 
&gt; Why do you do Zazen in public places? Isn't this gimmicks and exhibitionism?

&gt; Traditionally, it is forbidden to meditate - in a way that is obvious to others - in public places.

&gt; Long time practitioners that I know of don't go out of the way to educate others. I see that your behaviour is no different from evangelization or recruiting people in to Zen. Monks may give lectures or instruction to or share a tip or insight with strictly those people who have gathered of their own accord.
 
So why do I sit Zazen in public places? ‘znvfoa’ gives several reasons as to why it may not be good practice. I appreciate learning about it. For example, I was unaware that traditionally public sitting practice may have been forbidden. I take ‘znvfoa’s points seriously and do not wish to be defensive against them.
 
Yes, sitting Zazen in public is a form of gimmickry and exhibitionism. More precisely, it is Seikan who arranges and performs something from the limited and deluded position of a human being. There may be some variations within what we do as human beings. We like to apply labels to these, like ‘good’ or ‘bad’. But all of them exist within the business of being human.
 
Zazen is outside of the business of being human. The practice of Zazen initiates a meeting between the Buddha and the ‘me’. The human sits down for Zazen, but because Zazen adopts the human, all human business is effectively suspended. No ‘meditating’, no mystical or 'special' experiences, nothing left to exhibit or to hide.
 
Human beings come to Zazen. If they stay, they become Zazen. Nothing less or more. Kodo Sawaki Roshi says: “To practice Zazen is to become the transparent self.” It does not just stop somewhere. It encompasses all of our delusions too.

I've been meditating for a long time now, and I've believed for a long time in the oneness of all things, and that human beings intrinsically have value.

I've been able to experience oneness, through meditation, one time to a small degree. It was a feeling of bliss, a loss of self, and a feeling of love and connection with humanity.

I tried LSD for the first time this weekend, and man oh man, I believe I actually became one with the Universe. That's how it felt like. My sense of self completely disappeared. My ego disappeared. I felt the energy of life flowing through me, and I felt the same energy flowing through everyone else.

I felt love for everyone, because I was everyone. But there was no I anymore.

I no longer saw features and faces, I saw things in their purest form. I saw life in it's purest form. I perceived people as energy and light and that's all there was. There was hot and cold energy, and this drove everything, the push and pull of the universe, the yin and the yang.

Life felt so beautiful. I felt so much love for all of creation. It's incorrect to say that ""I"" felt love. because there was no I. It simply was, and there was only love.

Every now and then, the energy of life would want to express it self and it would make me dance in amazing ways. Then the energy would choose over someone else, and another would express life by dancing. Rhythm was important, life seemed to follow rhythm and it felt like the heartbeat of all living things.

At some point, to comeback down, I regained my sense of self by remembering names and places and this led me back to myself. I had to detach my energy and recreate my ego. 

For the next few hours, my brain felt as if it had been reshaped and was slow setting into place. Much like jello is initially liquid and it begins to take it's shape as it settles.

During the trip, and the comedown, I had a sense of enlightenment. I understood. I feel changed.

years this boulder was there, rocking and swaying, but always keeping its balance just perfectly.
But one year, there happened to be a severe windstorm; severe enough it was, to topple the 
boulder from its majestic height and dash it to the bottom of the cliff, far far below.  Needless to
say, the boulder was smashed into many pieces.  Where it hit, the ground was covered with a
carpet of pebbles--some small and some large--but pebbles and pebbles and more pebbles for
as far as you could walk in an hour.

One day, after all this, a young man by the name of Ichabod happened on the area.  Being a
fellow of keen mind and observational powers, naturally he was quite astounded to see so many
stones scattered so closely on the ground.  Now Ichabod was very much interested in the nature
of things, and he spent the whole afternoon looking at pebbles, and measuring the size of
pebbles, and feeling the weight of pebbles, and just pondering about pebbles in general.

He spent the night there, not wanting to lose this miraculous find, and awoke the next morning full
of enthusiasm.  He spent many days on his carpet of stones.

Eventually he noticed a very strange thing.  There were three rather large stones on the carpet
and they formed a triangle--almost (but not quite) equilateral.  He was amazed.  Looking further
he found four very white stones that were arranged in a lopsided square.  Then he saw that by
disregarding one white stone and thinking of that grey stone a foot over instead, it was a perfect
square!  And if you chose this stone, and that stone, and that one, and that one and that one
you have a pentagon as large as the triangle.  And here a small hexagon.  And there a square
partially inside of the hexagon.  And a decagon.  And two triangles inter-locked.  And a circle.
And a smaller circle within the circle. And a triangle within that which has a red stone, a grey
stone and a white stone.

Ichabod spent many hours finding many designs that became more and more complicated as his
powers of observation grew with practice.  Then he began to log his designs in a large leather
book; and as he counted designs and described them, the pages began to fill as the sun
continued to return.

He had begun his second ledger when a friend came by.  His friend was a poet and also
interested in the nature of things.

""My friend,"" cried Ichabod, ""come quickly!  I have discovered the most wondrous thing in the
universe.""  The poet hurried over to him, quite anxious to see what it was.

Ichabod showed him the carpet of stones... but the poet only laughed and said ""It's nothing but
scattered rocks!""

""But look,"" said Ichabod, 'see this triangle and that square and that and that.""  And he
proceeded to show his friend the harvest of his many days study. When the poet saw the designs
he turned to the ledgers and by the time he was finished with these, he too was overwhelmed.

He began to write poetry about the marvellous designs.  And as he wrote and contemplated he
became sure that the designs must mean something.  Such order and beauty is too monumental
to be senseless.  And the designs were there, Ichabod had shown him.

The poet went back to the village and read his new poetry. And all who heard him went to the cliff
to see first hand the carpet of designs.  And all returned to the village to spread the word. Then
as the enthusiasm grew there developed a group of those who love beauty and nature, all of
whom went to live right at the Designs themselves.  Together they wanted to see every design
that was there.

Some wrote ledger about just triangles.  Others described the circles.  Others concentrated on
red colored stones--and they happened to be the first to see designs springing from outside the
carpet.  They, and some others, saw designs everywhere they went.

""How blind we have been,"" they said.

The movement grew and grew and grew.  And all who could see the designs knew that they had
to have been put there by a Great Force. ""Nothing but a Great Force,"" said the philosophers,
""could create this immense beauty!""

""Yes,"" said the world, ""nothing but a god could create such magnificent order.  Nothing but a
God.""

And that was the day that God was born.  And ever since then, all men have known Him for His
infinite power and all men have loved Him for His infinite wisdom.

I was laying on my couch reading Alan Watts ""The Way of Zen"" and came upon the following passage.

""Like a sword that cuts, but cannot cut itself; Like an eye that sees, but cannot see itself.a The illusion of the split comes from the mind’s attempt to be both itself and its idea of itself, from a fatal confusion of fact with symbol. To make an end of the illusion, the mind must stop trying to act upon itself, upon its stream of experiences, from the standpoint of the idea of itself which we call the ego.""

Immediately after reading that I felt my mind change.  The best I can describe it was that all of the mental paths I had opened condensed into one.   Looking around my room every object was completely clear.  There was only right now and nothing else.   For about 10 minutes i just looked around and felt no desire to move or think, just to look.   It wasn't necessarily pleasurable and there was really no emotion, there just was existing.   For some reason this 10 minute experience was totally exhausting and I fell asleep for about 15 minutes.  I awoke and felt the same.  Then after a bit and going about my day it disappeared and I wasn't aware of it anymore!

____________________________________________________

There are a few notions that seem to get in the way of meditation practice. While I do not claim to be a Zen Master or to be enlightened, I have been lucky enough to study with those who are.

First, you said ""I,"" and that is a mistake.

You think ""I am""- you think that you are your thoughts. This isn't the case. Your thinking is a sense, a tool. Not unlike your sense of smell, or taste, or sight.

When you walk down the street and you smell a terrible odor, do you say ""I smell terrible"" and get mad at your nose? This is how we treat our thinking.

A Zen master once told me, ""It's like if a carpenter came up to you and laid out his tools- his screwdriver, a measuring tape, and so on, and said to you 'isn't this a beautiful house?' “

Meditation then, is an action that aims to bring you to the place before thinking arises. This means a lack of distinctions- time, place, me, you, black, white, red, hurts, feels good, hungry, thinking, not thinking, etc.

Like you said, you notice your thoughts arising, but who notices? It is natural to think, but we should not be attached to this thinking. As Korzybski said, ""The map is not the territory."" In other words, can you wash yourself in the river on a map? Can you drink it when you are thirsty? This is like our thinking- we take it as real, but it is not.

Our ego identity is derived from this thinking, therefore it is not.

Descartes said, ""I think, therefore I am."" Zen Master Seung Sahn said ""I am not thinking, therefore what?""

Yet even by saying a lack of distinction, you make a distinction between that and having distinctions. This is why in Zen you often see the master hitting a student- because by speaking they create distinction, but by hitting there is only the experience of that moment. You do not think ""I am being hit"" and then feel it, but rather you instantly feel that moment, without distinction.

All of this points toward one place- answering ""What am I?""

The answer- ""don't know.""

But this not knowing, that you know very well. Let's look into that.

And like others have said, there is nothing you get when you attain satori, enlightenment, annutarasamyaksambodhi, buddhamind, christnature, etc. You already have it. You just don't know it- because knowing is a distinction.

Think of your mind like a very very complicated calculator. When you pick it up each day, it has the remainder of whatever calculations you did the day before (or in our case probably many years). What do you do? Start calculating? Of course not. First you must clear it, because otherwise it can not give you any valid information- it is skewed by previous data (which simply does not exist and is not relevant)

Again, your ""thinking"" is a tool, a sense, nothing special.

There is a Mahayana Buddhist text called ""The Diamond Sutra"" that addresses all of this very clearly, and in doing so deconstructs the very tools and words used to address it. Reading this did more for me years of meditation. You can find it here (and many places with different translations) :http://personal.palouse.net/lotus/diamondsutra.htm

I would also recommend watching a lecture given by Hyon Gak Sunim on this sutra: http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8691172765637795347#

He explains Korean Buddhism (Zen) and the idea of living in the present moment very well. Also this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7OYwYyYT6s

Again, do not rely on forms, or distinctions. Even The Diamond Sutra has no inherent value, and as with meditation, the importance is what it is pointing to. Before thought. Before distinction. Before thought there is no me, there is no you. There is only the present moment.

You are not in the past. You are not in the future. When are you not in the present moment? When you are thinking.

But again- thinking/not thinking- this too is a distinction. It's why we meditate, not talk, not study. That would be like chasing our tail. And you can meditate in any part of daily life- don't be attached to form and how you sit, breathe, etc. These things are good, but only as a guide. The Buddha often said his teaching is like a raft, and it too must be left behind upon crossing the divide.

This is basically what I understand of Zen Buddhism and meditation at this point. I hope it helps. And again, these words do not express anything as they are only words- just look where they are pointing.

If you blink, you might miss it.

My question, with the caveat that I have a limited understanding of both Zen and Buddhism generally, is this:

If teachings suggest we should ""accept"" the current state of things to achieve happiness, to be free of anxiety, regret, fear, and [all else](http://i.imgur.com/btUig2v.jpg), doesn't this mindset inherently ""accept"" the way the world is, the suffering within, the inequality, and all the other plights?

Sure, I might be missing the point -- there is nothing good or bad, but thinking makes it so. Sure, if those in the most suffering accepted Zen truly, perhaps this ""suffering"" would go away. 

But the entire world isn't going to accept Zen anytime soon, suffering will continue. Is there not some responsibility, some onus to build a better world (rather than merely ""accept"" it)?

It is in this way that I ask -- is Zen cowardly? Cowardly for accepting the suffering around it, without placing *change* at its core? Cowardly in that ""acceptance"" and ""enlightenment"" are veils which allow individuals freedom and happiness...while the world burns.

I've often found this situation bizarre. If Zen isn't about awakening, what is it about?

In the late 1960's there was a Rinzai monk named Zenkei Shibayama -- actually the head of the entire Rinzai order in Japan -- who came to America a few times, spoke at universities, and got several of his books translated and published in English, including *Zen Comments on the Mumonkan*. He was quite old and died in the mid 1970's, but his work to me looks like a ""road not taken"" for American Zen. Master Shunryu Suzuki and his students were far more effective a popularizing a Soto version of Zen, dismissing satori-experiences in favor of ""sitting"" together on zafus and ""breathing.""

Shibayama's writings are a really extreme contrast to Shunryu Suzuki's *Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind*, partly because of the relish and humor with which he describes the sudden enlightenment experiences of the great Masters.

For example, here is Shibayama's note on Mumon Ekai:

""Master Mumon was first ordained as a Buddhist monk under Master Tenryu Ko and later moved to Master Getsurin Shikan. He studied very hard with the koan ""Has a Dog the Buddha Nature""? under Master Getsurin for six long years, going through the most assiduous training, and one day when he heard the drumbeat he was suddenly enlightened. The poem he made on that occasion is: 'A thunderclap under a clear blue sky!/All beings on earth have opened their eyes./Everything under the sun has bowed at once./Mount Sumeru jumps up and dances.' The next day Mumon presented his attainment to Master Getsurin, who verified his satori. Finally he succeeded the Master.""

This is in some ways the most typical and ordinary of the satoris in the book. There are some stranger ones, such as:

""One day Hyakujo was walking with his teacher Baso. Seeing a wild goose flying in the sky, Baso asked Hyakujo, 'What is it?' 'A wild goose, master,' replied Hyakujo. Baso asked, 'Where is it flying to?' Hyakujo replied, 'It is already gone.' There upon Baso clutched Hyakujo's nose and wrenched it. Hyakujuo cried out in pain. Baso demanded, 'Do you say it has flown away?' This at once awakened Hyakujo. Some years later, Hyakujo came to have a Zen interview with Baso, and after exchanging mondo on the subject of a hossu hanging in the alcove, Baso uttered a great shout which completely crushed everything in Hyakujo, and he was thoroughly enlightened.""

At one point, Shibayama comments: 

""Let me repeat: the ultimate aim of Zen is to accomplish a completely new personality by the satori experience, and to live Zen at every moment. Without this fundamental experience, whatever special skill or psyche one may have [even the ability to enter samadhi at will], it is not Zen at all.""

A day without tampering with the world, a day for reflection, enjoyment, and looking ahead, without the usual frantic involvement. 

This week has felt kind of chaotic. I've been thinking pretty excitedly about a potential new project. I've been snoozing more than usual in the mornings. I've felt a bit confused about what to get for my new apartment, and everything's kind of messy. I got a gym membership but I haven't gone. I've been feeling a bit socially anxious, which comes in waves for me, in sync with various other causes and symptoms. I have been looking forward to spring, and feeling tired of darkness and cold.

I'd just like to say that there are at least five ways of taking Zen as Serious Business.

""Ha-ha, Zen, what a load of dung!"" And yet another is to neither be serious about it nor whimsy, but maintaining a kind of careful ironic distance. And penultimately, you can be nihilistic about it -- ""Zen is nothing. I am nothing. The world and nirvana are both lousy shitholes. Bah!""

Lately I have been thinking that Zen seems to contradict ambition and self improvement. Indeed, our roshi mentioned that wanting to ""do"" zazen to improve one's self is missing the point.

If ambition for self improvement traditionally requires a dissatisfaction with the way things are (i.e. things are ""bad"") and in Zen everything just ""is"" (no labels). Zen, to me, then seems to support a sort of complacency. I find this comforting (I am okay the way I am) but a little disturbing (reconciling Zen and striving for promotions etc.

Does anyone have any suggestions for readings or lectures on this topic? It would help (at least for now) to hear or read a voice other than my own on this topic as it's been nagging at me lately.

&gt; I was sent to a Confucian teacher.  My mother had him teach me the Great Learning by the rote method.  When I came to the place where it says that the ""way of great learning lies in clarifying bright virtue"" I was brought to a stop by the words, ""bright virtue.""  I just couldn't understand what they meant.
&gt; 
&gt; I asked some Confucian scholars... one of them said that knotty problems like mine were something that Zen priests knew about.  Since I was still no closer to understanding bright virtue, I decided to follow his advice.  But in those days, there were no Zen temples in the area, so I was unable to find any Zen priests to question.
&gt; 
&gt; I decided that, no matter what happened, I was going to get to the bottom of this bright virtue.  If I heard a sermon was being held somewhere, I'd run off immediately and listen to it... But bright virtue remained beyond my grasp.
&gt; 
&gt; I finally succeeded in locating a Zen priest.  He told me if I wanted to understand bright virtue, I should do zazen... I didn't stop until I could no longer sit up under my own power and toppled over... As I pushed myself past the bounds of physical endurance... the skin on my buttocks became lacerated.  Never once, day or night, did I lie down and rest.
&gt; 
&gt; The adverse effects of the long years of physical punishment finally led to a serious illness.  And I still hadn't clarified bright virtue, in spite of all the time and effort.  Whenever I spat, gouts of bloody sputum as big as thumb heads appeared.
&gt; 
&gt; ...Kindly people who lived nearby... arranged for someone to look after me.  For a whole week, I couldn't swallow anything except some thin rice broth.  I became resigned to the fact that I was going to die.  I viewed it as inevitable and felt no great regret.  The only thing that really bothered me was having to die without discovering the meaning of bright virtue.
&gt; 
&gt; Then I felt a strange sensation in my throat.  I spat against a wall.  A mass of black phlegm large as a soapberry rolled down the side.  It seemed to relieve the discomfort in my chest.  Suddenly, just at that moment, it came to me.  I realized what it was that had escaped me until now.
&gt; 
&gt; If only I had encountered someone with a real understanding of the Dharma to speak with while I was traveling around from place to place struggling with my problem, I wouldn't have had to expend all that useless effort.
&gt; 
&gt; I wanted to talk to someone about it... [after traveling] I thought I would visit some Zen priests...  [One of them] explained Zen teaching to me.  I said, ""All that you and everyone else here has said to me is very true... only somehow or other the feeling I get is that of scratching an itchy foot with my shoe on.  It's not getting to the itch.""
&gt; 
&gt; [The Zen monk] answered, ""Of course.  It's just as you say.  We teach others in the same manner we ourselves have been taught.  We just follow the teachings of the previous masters, which are found written down in sutras and Zen records.  I 'm ashamed to say it, but the fact is that what we teach isn't really based on enlightenment.  Since we're not really enlightened, it's understandable that you should say what you do about our teaching not being able to reach the place that itches.""

If people are reading /r/Zen then I have to assume that they are students of the Way, because otherwise why be here and join the discussion unless you are drifting by? The thing is, if you are a seeker then it is better to do zazen rather than being taken by the easy way out approach of sudden enlightenment. If you subscribe to idea that there is nothing to attain, no teachings set forth then it is no different to me than a fancy nihilism and I do not consider it zen.

I'd like to ask the very question that monks have been asking their teachers. ""Why did Bodhidharma come to China?"" and ""Why did Shakyamuni meditated after his awakening?"". If you asked these questions during Huangbo and Linji era then you would be smacked, but how are they invalid questions? If all Buddhas past and the future were seeking spiritual wisdom then we have a contradictory information on our hands. Many Chan masters disregard any teachings and will say that there is nothing to attain. If you had a belief that there is a black swan and I told you that there are none exist, and I could actually convince you then would you not put faith in me? How is this different from any other faith? Just because I tell you that black swan does no exists, will you stop seeking it? Is this all that takes to convince you?

The way I look at it, there are two ways to approach this dilemma: one is active and the other is passive. As a seeker of Dharma, will you not value your own experience over somebody elses? I would have to argue that accepting ""no attainment"" doctrine requires MORE faith than sitting zazen, for the reason that with zazen at least you are your personal master and explorer, you have direct experience. And when you passively accept that there is nothing to attain then you are going solely on blind faith that there is in fact nothing to attain so you might as well do nothing but is this direct experience? 

After meditating for years, lets say you gained nothing from it, arent you happy that you came to this realization through direct experience? As a seeker, how can you potentially be sore and frown upon meditation and look at it as a waste of time when the very meditation gave you the answer. (Assuming that ""nothing to attain"" is actually true and we are disregarding original definition of enlightenment that Buddha attained). To give you something to thing about, early Chan masters did in fact meditate and this tradition was reinstated with Caodong/Soto school, while later more famous Chan masters disregarded meditation. So who is right and who is wrong? Would you not want to drive on that road yourself to see where it leads because if you dont then why be here and not find refugee in nihilism philosophy? It certainly does not require any meditation.

Another way I look at zazen, is that its a true manifestation of the Buddha nature. When you let your mind and body drop away with all conceptual thought then what do you see? Do you not attain the mind of the Buddha and the ""Dharma eye"", how can you possibly see something different when there is nothing to see and conceptualize? Is this not looking into our true nature, is this not attainment of the Dharma eye and the void? 

My analogy to zazen and meditation is comparing mind to a glass of water, when you sit you let the mud settle and you see everything clearly but when you let your mind wonder then the glass is stirred and vision is obscured then enlightenment and the Dharma eye becomes something that we not suddenly attain and retain but more of something we recapture again and again in our zazen sessions.

**Enlightened Mis-communication**

Provided he makes and wins an argument about Buddhism with those who live there, any wondering monk can remain in a Zen temple. If he is defeated, he has to move on.

In a temple in the northern part of Japan two brother monks were dwelling together. The elder one was learned, but the younger one was stupid and had but one eye.

A wandering monk came and asked for lodging, properly challenging them to a debate about the sublime teachings. The elder brother, tired that day from much studying, told the younger one to take his place. ""Go and request the dialogue in silence,"" he cautioned.

So the young monk and the stranger went to the shrine and sat down.

Shortly afterwards the traveler rose and went in to the elder brother and said: ""Your young brother is a wonderful fellow. He defeated me.""

""Relate the dialogue to me,"" said the elder one.

""Well,"" explained the traveler, ""first I held up one finger, representing Buddha, the enlightened one. So he held up two fingers, signifying Buddha and his teaching. I held up three fingers, representing Buddha, his teaching, and his followers, living the harmonious life. Then he shook his clenched fist in my face, indicating that all three come fromone realization. Thus he won and so I have no right to remain here."" With this, the traveler left.

""Where is that fellow?"" asked the younger one, running in to his elder brother.

""I understand you won the debate.""

""Won nothing. I'm going to beat him up.""

""Tell me the subject of the debate,"" asked the elder one.

""Why, the minute he saw me he held up one finger, insulting me by insinuating that I have only one eye. Since he was a stranger I thought I would be polite to him, so I held up two fingers, congratulating him that he has two eyes. Then the impolite wretch held up three fingers, suggesting that between us we only have three eyes. So I got mad and started to punch him, but he ran out and that ended it!""

I know I need to do some reading on this, but I joined /r/zen because I thought that I could get the gist and see if it was for me or not, then I'd decide if I wanted to read more up on it.

Anyways, the other day I went running, pondering the idea of no-self. I'd watched an Alan Watts video earlier that day (The Real You, if anyone is wondering) and it had left this sort of imprint on me. It was all rattling inside of my brain and then, while I was in the shower, I understood. You cannot pull one thing apart from another, not completely. The way we do so is completely arbirtrary. Everything is so interconnected and our language ignores it, doesn't allow it.

And then it hit me: every idea, every thought, every ""this is the way things are"" was a human creation. We think because we label something, we understand it, but 'understanding' itself is a human creation. The universe/the whatever transcends this. The universe doesn't need to understand. It just is. There is not judgement. There is nothing that we don't impose on it. Nothing and everything and not nothing and not everything all at once.

I actually cried, realizing this. I went for a walk outside and looked at the trees and realized, inside, that they were a part of it all, just the same way I was. They were the experience of being a tree and I was the experience of being a person. My ego was my own creation. It's necessary to live in the world that we do, but it wasn't real. 

I don't know what this means. I need to read more on Zen perhaps to see if what I realized was a step in the right direction. I'd like some guidance. I feel like I don't know what happened because I only meditate occasionally but I would like to do it more. To just be, free of thought.

This survey has been created as an attempt to compile information on the various religious beliefs, and lack thereof, on Reddit. Please answer all questions with sincerity and honesty. Please note, this is not a quick ""check one and done"" survey and may take a little while to complete. Also, I have NOT included topics like abortion and homosexuality for a reason. Please do not bring them up in this survey's topic. We are collecting opinions on spirituality, not attempting to fire up yet another debate.
Please upvote this survey so that more data can be collected. This is a self post, so I'm not getting any karma. But we get the best results when many, many people take the survey.

Survey Link: http://www.screator.net/showform.php?f=620542889

A full list of the subreddits being surveyed follows: r/Christianity, r/Atheism, r/Buddhism, r/Hinduism, r/Islam, r/Pagan, r/Judaism, r/TrueAtheism, r/Agnosticism, r/Deism, r/NeoPagan, r/Satanism, r/Scientology, r/Humanism, r/Taoism, r/Shinto, r/UUreddit, r/Pantheism, r/DebateReligion, r/ExploreReligion, r/Catholicism, r/NewAge.
If you have any subreddit suggestions, please comment! I'll probably post it there as well. The survey ends Sunday, July 22, 2012.

This concept is not new to me as Taoism has something similar known as zero doctorine. This begs the question though, without concern for the Buddha's teachings, what makes Zen Buddhist? If the 
'Buddhism' part of Zen Buddhism is an arbitrary label used to categorize different schools of thought. Then why would a group concerned with shedding the unnecessary keep useless labels. Or also, why would there be Buddhist statues in the Zen Temples? While I am curious to know these answers, I still very much enjoy what little understanding of Zen and Buddhism that I have learned and will definitely encorporate them into my Taoistic life to create some hodge podge philosophy...or has Zen already done that for me?

Excerpt from the Lankavatara Sutra (trans. Pine) where the Buddha (Bhagavan) was (still) answering Mahamati's questions:

Mahamati once more asked the Buddha: ""The Bhagavan has said, 'From the night I attained perfect enlightenment until the night I enter nirvana, between the two I do not speak nor have I spoken, nor will I speak a single word, for not speaking is how a buddha speaks.' Bhagavan, why does the Tathagata, the Arhat, the Fully Enlightened one say 'not speaking is how a buddha speaks'?""

The Buddha told Mahamati, ""It is because of two truths that I make such a statement as this. And which two? They are the truth that depends on personal realization and the ever-present truth. These are the two truths. It is because of these two truths that I make such a statement. 

""And what do I mean by the truth that depends on personal realization? Whatever other tathagatas realize, I also realize, nothing more, nothing less. But the ultimate realm of the truth that depends on personal realization is beyond explanations or distinctions and beyond dualistic terms.

""And what do I mean by the ever-present truth? This refers to the way of the ancient sages. The Dharma Realm is ever-present, like the nature of gold or silver. Whether a tathagata appears in the world or does not appear in the world, the Dharma Realm is ever-present. It is like a road that leads to a city. Imagine a man walking in the wilderness who sees this straight and level road leading toward an ancient city and follows it to that city, where he enjoys whatever he desires. Mahamati, what do you think? Did he make the road or that city's delights?"" 

Mahamati answered, ""No.""

The Buddha told Mahamati, ""The ever-present Dharma Realm of myself and all buddhas of the past is also like this. This is the reason I say that from the night of my enlightenment until I enter nirvana, between the two, I do not speak, nor have I spoken, nor will I speak a single word.""

-----
Compare with Huangbo:

""Even the three kinds of thousands of great chiliocosms [realms] are all your own self, nor are they anything at all outside your own mind.  It follows then that the green mountains and blue water and the multitudinous eyes of the infinite would are just voidness that is very clear and bright.  Moreover, if you have the no-view' of things, then all sounds and forms are the wisdom-eyes of Buddha.  The Dharma that phenomena are real does not raise a solitary thing that depends on a created realm.  Even so, for sentient beings the Buddha used many different kinds of wisdom.  However, Buddha spoke all day and said nothing; and sentient beings listened from morning to night but heard nothing.  In this sense it can be asserted that Buddha Shakyamuni spoke the Dharma for forty-nine years but never spoke a single word.""


----
Compare with Joshu:

A nun asked, ""Master, will you teach me the truth that has never
been spoken?""

Joshu rebuked her: ""Hey! The kettle is scorched!""

Thanks again to everybody who participated in our last student to student session. Now that we've heard a voice in the Rinzai community, it could be really interesting to hop over to the Soto side and put these two flavours of Zen in perspective.

Our next volunteer has been practising Zen for over twenty years now, and has trained in a couple of monasteries in Japan, and served as resident priest in the Anchorage Zen community for a few years.  He also happens to be one of my favourite bloggers.  You may have seen some of Koun Franz's articles in this forum, for example, his piece on [authentic practice](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/wildfoxzen/2012/01/authentic-practice.html).  

So if you've enjoyed his writing, or have anything you've been dying ask, or maybe just want to know a little bit more about Zen, here's a great chance to start a conversation!

## How this works

*One Monk, One Month, One Question.*

1. (You) reply to this post, with questions about Zen for our volunteer.
2. We collect questions for 2 or 3 days
3. On 1 May, the volunteer chooses one of these questions, for example, the top-voted one or one they find particularly interesting
4. By 4 May, they answer the question
5. We post and archive the answer.

## About our volunteer

* Name: Koun Franz 
* Lineage: Soto Zen, teacher and training in Japan
* Length of Practice: since 1991 
* Background: I grew up in Montana, where I started practicing with a local group right after high school. I moved to Japan after college and met my teacher, and later entered monastic training at Zuioji and Shogoji monasteries. I served as resident priest of the Anchorage Zen Community in Alaska from 2006 to 2010, then returned to Japan with my family. Here, I study, train, lecture, and do Buddhist-related translation work. Some of my lectures can be found on AZC's [website](http://www.alaska-zen.org/resources/dharma-talks) and on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw-qLirGpKZFfpFroomz_9A); my writings on Buddhism can be found on [Nyoho Zen](http://nyoho.com/) and [One Continuous Mistake](http://continuousmistake.com/).

How can you find the answer if you think you already know it? To angrily reject what appears to be nonsense is to have preconceptions about the answer.

How could you tell a two-dimensional being to look up or down from their two dimensional plane? No words or concepts in their language would describe it. No matter what direction they looked, you'd have to say ""you're looking in the wrong direction."" There you have the essence of zen. When ""you"" know the ""truth"", ""you"" disappear. Your life turns into an illusion. Reality itself feels something like an illusion. Obviously, it appears as though we're here, that there are phenomena. How could it be otherwise? But you can imagine our reality is like a roll of film played in an empty room. The roll of film differs not at all whether it's played or not! There's light, and sound, and it's still just a projection, or an illusion, because no one or nothing observes it. And everything is one. This universe, every possible universe. You will know this, and more, and it will not be speculation. It will be a blinding certainty that leaves you with nothing to seek.

That's zen. It doesn't have anything to do with meditation and cushions. It only has a little to do with koans.

Of course, I'm wrong. I'm a two dimensional being trying to tell you how to look up into the third dimension, with no words with which to do it, trying to express what I myself cannot truly perceive. In fact, it's so tricky to get your mind to bend just the right way that it's impossible to say anything about it without being wrong. The hope is that it somehow triggers you to see your true nature, or the true nature. Any thought that I have that I have grasped or understood the third dimension is above me is false, which does nothing at all to negate it's reality, as if by chance a monkey had typed out Shakespeare in the absence of human society. A false understanding has arisen in my mind, with the knowledge that it is itself illusion, and collapsed, taking down every word, thought, and concept I ever had with it. I know that I am correct, that ""I"" don't exist at all, and that there is no correct. They all hinged on meaning having meaning, and when that collapsed, it all collapsed with it. But yet it's still here

What is it that doesn't arise due to causes and conditions, that cannot be caused and so can never cease? On what backdrop can our reality itself exist, if time came into existence at the big bang? What is nothing, and how could something ever have come out of it? Maybe nothing did. Maybe nothing has. Maybe that does not contradict that you seem to exist here and now reading this. How could that be?

I don't know what I can say to reach you. I probably can't say anything. I have to way no express this. No one can. But if you go on seeking, in earnest, following roughly the path of zen, non-dualism, perhaps some meditation, perhaps some koan practice, you might just trigger an understanding beyond anything you've ever known, that ironically stands in contraindication to itself. You read these words, and they have meaning. Because they're set in the context of your mind. You're set in the context of a human society. When you expand beyond all context, you are left without meaning. This is the ultimate insight, and it undoes itself, destroying meaning as complete illusion at the time it's grasped. You don't get to hold a new insight. You realize you never really existed in the way you thought you did and walk away with nothing. And that's okay, because you have nothing left to seek.

I don't know if I can say it any plainer than that. And it's easy to understand why Zen masters would destroy written texts. It's so very easy to get caught on the words. The words are meaningless! These words are meaningless! Meaning is an illusion that arises from reality reflecting on itself. But I call it illusion for a reason, rather that just say simply that it doesn't exist. What if a man had no mind, there were no meaning behind his actions, yet by chance, his every word, action, and deed made it appear so, and he himself could not tell he was not sentient? How could this be? Were you to ask him, ""are you sentient?"" he would reply, ""of course. What kind of question is that?"" and not be sentient in the slightest. Could you imagine that we are all this person, that there is no distinction between you, this universe, and every possible universe?

Where do numbers come from? The natural numbers, irrational numbers, what have you? They're infinitely small, even non-existent points on a line. We get them by naming all of the numbers around them. 2 exists because we define 1 and 3 around it in the natural numbers. Each one is nothing, absolutely nothing, and in a miraculous act of creation, we bring them into existence as a set, all defined in terms of each other. Our reality itself is like this, which may be why mathematics describes it so well. It's all nothing, arranged and seen just so. Points of nothing, of no area, labelled and considered related to each other so that they appear to be something. It exists against all of the other possibilities. It's a possibility, a wave. It doesn't take time to elapse, it's just ""existing"" there, or ""not-existing"", with every other possibility or universe.

I only mean this to point the way, to describe some of the ways I perceive the truth. I'm limited. I'm an instantiation of form that has realized its nature in the formless, and can only cast my incorrect perceptions into incorrect words that might be of benefit to ""others"" (since discrete sentient beings don't exist.) I was defeated the second I tried. You're wrong whether you've understood what I've written perfectly or not. Were you to grasp my meaning, it would be no meaning, and would undo itself, like a letter that burns up upon reading it, and also burns every book in the Library of Congress in the process. 

If you tell me I'm wrong, I can't argue with you. Of course I'm wrong. I can only hope that reading this triggers something for someone. I see so much zen cast in antiquated language and concepts, not from a living understanding, but rehashed and dulled by cultural gaps and elapsed centuries. This is a very small attempt to cast it into something more modern, and it's not well served by an excess of words in any case.

After freeing himself, Dogen embarked on an unprecedented exploration of this space/time continuum from the point of view of a fully awakened person which he described with exquisite care in his momentus work, Shobogenzo.

Before engaging in this decades-long journey, Dogen clarified, beyond the shadow of a doubt, how human beings can free themselves completely from their conditioning - which is the only freedom worth giving up *everything* to obtain. This is what he taught:

To enter by reason means to realize the essence through instruction and to believe that all living things share the same true nature, which isn’t apparent because it’s shrouded by sensation and delusion. Those who turn from delusion back to reality, who meditate on walls,’ the absence of self and other, the oneness of mortal and sage, and who remain unmoved even by scriptures are in complete and unspoken agreement with reason. Without moving, without effort, they enter, we say, by reason.

To enter by practice refers to four all-inclusive practices: Suffering injustice, adapting to conditions, seeking nothing, and practicing the Dharma. First, suffering injustice. When those who search for the Path encounter adversity, they should think to themselves, ""In Countless ages gone by, I’ve turned from the essential to the trivial and wandered through all manner of existence, often angry without cause and guilty of numberless transgressions.

Now, though I do no wrong, I’m punished by my past. Neither gods nor men can foresee when an evil deed will bear its fruit. I accept it with an open heart and without complaint of injustice. The sutras say "" when you meet with adversity don’t be upset because it makes sense."" With such understanding you’re in harmony with reason. And by suffering injustice you enter the Path. Second, adapting to conditions. As mortals, we’re ruled by conditions, not by ourselves. All the suffering and joy we experience depend on conditions. If we should be blessed by some great reward, such as fame or fortune, it’s the fruit of a seed planted by us in the past. When conditions change, it ends. Why delight In Its existence? But while success and failure depend on conditions, the mind neither waxes nor wanes. Those who remain unmoved by the wind of joy silently follow the Path.

Third, seeking nothing. People of this world are deluded. They’re always longing for something-always, in a word, seeking. But the wise wake up. They choose reason over custom. They fix their minds on the sublime and let their bodies change with the seasons. All phenomena are empty. They contain nothing worth desiring. Calamity forever alternates with Prosperity! To dwell in the three realms is to dwell in a burning house. To have a body is to suffer. Does anyone with a body know peace? Those who understand this detach themselves from all that exists and stop Imagining or seeking anything. The sutras say, ""To seek is to suffer.

To seek nothing is bliss."" When you seek nothing, you’re on the Path. Fourth, practicing the Dharma.’ The Dharma is the truth that all natures are pure. By this truth, all appearances are empty. Defilement and attachment, subject and object don’t exist. The sutras say, ""The Dharma includes no being because it’s free from the impurity of being, and the Dharma includes no self because it’s free from the impurity of self."" Those wise enough to believe and understand these truths are bound to practice according to the Dharma. And since that which is real includes nothing worth begrudging, they give their body, life, and property in charity, without regret, without the vanity of giver, gift, or recipient, and without bias or attachment. And to eliminate impurity they teach others, but without becoming attached to form. Thus, through their own practice they’re able to help others and glorify the Way of Enlightenment. And as with charity, they also practice the other virtues. But while practicing the six virtues to eliminate delusion, they practice nothing at all. This is what’s meant by practicing the Dharma.

On the first day all were silent. Their meditation had begun auspiciously, but when night came and the oil lamps were growing dim one of the pupils could not help exclaiming to a servant: ""Fix those lamps.""

The second pupil was surprised to hear the first one talk. ""We are not supposed to say a word,"" he remarked.

It's obvious /r/Zen has a some problems, but the world already has a lot of problems in it so why contribute to it and make our online community be a hard place for other people? There are already lots of places like that, and even if it were just one, it'd be more than what's acceptable.

And see, I'm not telling you to go along and accept everything and never discuss things, but to learn to get along.

People that argue and insult and the like, well, it's everyone of us, me included. That doesn't mean it's not a great  time to practice compassion and understanding. It's not easy. To me it's quite hard, as it's to anyone. But why not practice that?

In general semantics, it is always possible to give a description of empirical facts, but such descriptions remain just that--descriptions--which necessarily leave out many aspects of the objective, microscopic, and submicroscopic events they describe. According to general semantics, language, natural or otherwise (including the language called 'mathematics') can be used to describe the taste of an orange, but one cannot give the taste of the orange using language alone. According to general semantics, the content of all knowledge is structure, so that language (in general) and science and mathematics (in particular) can provide people with a structural 'map' of empirical facts, but there can be no 'identity', only structural similarity, between the language (map) and the empirical facts as lived through and observed by people as humans-in-environments (including doctrinal and linguistic environments).""

...

""The refusal to separate verbally what cannot be separated empirically, and the refusal to regard such verbal splits as evidence that the 'things' that are verbally split bear an additive relation to one another. For example, space-time cannot empirically be split into 'space' + 'time', a conscious organism (including humans) cannot be split into 'body' + 'mind', etc., therefore, people should never speak of 'space' and 'time' or 'mind' and 'body' in isolation, but always use the terms space-time or mind-body (or other organism-as-a-whole terms).""

Of course Zen should be imparted in this way, from heart to heart, and in the past it was really accomplished. Silence and humility reigned rather than profession and assertion. The one who received such a teaching kept the matter hidden even after twenty years. Not until another discovered through his own need that a real master was at hand was it learned that the teching had been imparted, and even then the occasion arose quite naturally and the teaching made its way in its own right. Under no circumstance did the teacher even claim ""I am the successor of So-and-so."" Such a claim would prove quite the contrary.

The Zen master Mu-nan had only one successor. His name was Shoju. After Shoju had completed his study of Zen, Mu-nan called him into his room. ""I am getting old,"" he said, ""and as far as I know, Shoju, you are the only one who will carry on this teaching. Here is a book. It has been passed down from master to master for seven generations. I have also added many points according to my understanding. The book is very valuable, and I am giving it to you to represent your successorhip.""

""If the book is such an important thing, you had better keep it,"" Shoju replied. ""I received your Zen without writing and am satisfied with it as it is.""

""I know that,"" said Mu-nan. ""Even so, this work has been carried from master to master for seven generations, so you may keep it as a symbol of having received the teaching. Here.""

They happened to be talking before a brazier. The instant Shoju felt the book in his hands he thrust it into the flaming coals. He had no lust for possessions.

Shoju shouted back: ""What are you saying!"" ",,False,,t5_2qhmf,False,,,True,t3_e5dne,http://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/e5dne/what_are_you_doing_what_are_you_saying/,

The mind is not interested in the method; it is
interested in the end result. And if you can bypass the method and reach the result, the
mind will be extremely happy.

Someone was asking me, ""Why so many methods? Kabir has said, 'SAHAJ SAMADHI
BHALI -- be spontaneous.' Spontaneous ecstasy is good, so there is no need of
methods.""
I told him, ""If you have achieved SAHAJ SAMADHI -- spontaneous ecstasy -- then of
course no method is useful; there is no need. Why have you come here?""
He said, ""I have not achieved yet, but I feel that SAHAJ -- the spontaneous -- is better.""
""But why do you feel that the spontaneous is better?"" I said. Because no method is
suggested, the mind feels good that you have nothing to do -- and without doing, you can
have EVERYTHING !

Because of this Zen has become a craze in the West -- because Zen says, achieve it
effortlessly; there is no need of effort. Zen is right; there is no need for an effort. But
remember, to achieve this point of no-effort you will need a long, long effort. To achieve
a point where no effort is needed, to achieve a point where you can remain in non-doing,
a long effort will be needed.
But the superficial conclusion that Zen says no effort is needed has become very
appealing in the West. If no effort is needed then the mind says: this is the right thing,
because you can do it without doing anything. But no one can do it.
Suzuki, who made Zen known in the West, has done a service and also a disservice. And the disservice will remain for a longer period. He was a very authentic man, one of the
most authentic men of this century, and for his whole life he struggled to carry the
message of Zen to the West. And alone, with his own effort, he made it known in the
West. And now there is a craze; there are Zen friends all over the West. Nothing appeals
like Zen now.
But the point is missed. The appeal has come only because Zen says no method is
needed, no effort is needed. You do not have to do anything; spontaneously it flowers.
This is right -- but you are not spontaneous, so it will never flower in you. To be
spontaneous... It looks absurd and contradictory, because for you to be spontaneous many
methods are needed to purify you, to make you innocent so that you can be spontaneous.
Otherwise you cannot be spontaneous in anything.

This VIGYANA BHAIRAVA TANTRA was translated into English by Paul Reps. He
has written a very beautiful book, ZEN FLESH, ZEN BONES, and just in the appendix
he included this book VIGYANA BHAIRAVA TANTRA.
The whole book is concerned with Zen; just in the appendix he added this book also, the
one hundred and twelve methods, and he called it a pre-Zen writing. Many Zen followers
didn't like this because they said, ""Zen says no effort is needed, and this book is
concerned only with effort. This book is concerned only with methods, and Zen says no
method, no effort is needed. So it is anti-Zen, not pre-Zen."" Superficially they are right,
but deep down they are not, because to achieve a spontaneous being one has to travel a
long way.

One of Gurdjieff's disciples, Ouspensky, used to say, whenever someone would come to
him to ask about the path, ""We don't know anything about the path. We only teach about
some footpaths which lead to the path. The path is not known to us."" Do not think that
you are already on the path. Even the path is far away. From where you are, from that
point, even the path is far away. So first you have to reach to the path. Ouspensky was a
very humble man, and it is very difficult to be religious and to be humble -- very, very
difficult, because once you begin to feel that you know, the head goes mad. He would
always say, ""We don't know anything about the path. It is very far away, and there is no
need just now to discuss it."" Wherever you are, first you have to create a link, a small
bridge, a footpath which will lead you to the path.
Spontaneity -- SAHAJ YOGA -- is very far away from you.
In the place where you are, you are totally artificial, cultivated and cultured. Nothing is
spontaneous -- NOTHING, I say, is spontaneous. When nothing is spontaneous in your
life, how can religion be spontaneous? When nothing is spontaneous, even love is not
spontaneous. Even love is a bargain, even love is a calculation, even love is an effort.
Then nothing can be spontaneous. And then to explode spontaneously into the cosmos is
impossible.
From the situation you are in, from that situation it is impossible. First you will have to
throw away all your artificiality, all your false attitudes, all your cultivated conventions,
all your prejudices. Only then will a spontaneous happening be possible. These methods
will help you to come to a point from where nothing is needed to be done -- just your
being is enough. But mind can deceive. And mind easily deceives, because then it can get
consolation.
Shiva never talks about any result, just methods. Remember this emphasis. Do
something, so that a moment may be possible when nothing is needed, when your central
being can just dissolve into the cosmos. But that has to be achieved. Zen's appeal is for
the wrong reasons, and the same is true for Krishnamurti, because he says no yoga is
needed, no method is needed. Really, he says there is no method of meditation. He is
right.
He is right, but Shiva says these one hundred and twelve methods of meditation are there,
and Shiva is also right.
And as far as YOU are concerned, Shiva is more right. And if you have to choose
between Krishnamurti and Shiva, then choose Shiva. Krishnamurti is of no use to you.
Even this can be said to help you -- that Krishnamurti is absolutely wrong. Remember, I
say to help you. And he is harmful. That too I say to help you, because if you get into his
argument you will not achieve samadhi. You will achieve only one conclusion -- that no
method is needed. And that is dangerous. For you method is needed!
There comes a moment when no method is needed, but that moment has not come for you
yet. And before that moment, to know about something that is ahead is dangerous. That is
why Shiva is silent. He will not say anything of the future, of what will happen. He
simply sticks to you, to what you are and what is to be done with you. Krishnamurti goes
on talking in terms which cannot be understood by you.

The logic can be felt. The logic is right; it is beautiful. It will be good if you can
remember the logic of Krishnamurti. He says that if you are doing some method, then
who is doing that method? The mind is doing it. And how can any method done by mind
dissolve mind? Rather, on the contrary, it will strengthen it more; it will strengthen your
mind more. It will become a conditioning, it will be false.
So meditation is spontaneous; you cannot do anything about it. What can you do about
love? Can you practice any method for how to love? If you practice, then your love will
be false.
It happens, it cannot be practiced. If even love cannot be practiced, how can prayer be
practiced? How can meditation be practiced?
The logic is exactly, absolutely right -- but not for you, because by listening to this logic
continuously you will be conditioned by this logic. And those who have been listening to
Krishnamurti for forty years are the most conditioned persons I have come across. They
say there is no method, and still they are nowhere.
I say, ""You have understood there is no method and you do not practice any method, but
has the spontaneity flowered in you?"" They say, ""No!""
And if I tell them, ""Then practice some method,"" immediately their conditioning comes
in. They say, ""There is no method.""
They have not been practicing any method, and samadhi has not happened. And if you
tell them, ""Then try some method,"" they say there is no method. So they are in a
dilemma. They have not moved an inch, and the reason is that they have been told
something which was not for them.

It is like teaching a small child about sex. You can go on teaching, but you are saying
something which is as yet meaningless for the child. And your teaching will be dangerous
because you are conditioning his mind. It is not his need; he is not concerned with it. He
doesn't know what sex means because his glands are still not functioning; his body is still
not sexual.
His energy has not yet moved biologically to the sex center, and you are talking to him.
Because he has ears, do you think that anything can be taught to him? Because he can
nod his head, do you think you can teach him anything?
You can teach, and your teaching can become dangerous and harmful. Sex is not an
inquiry for him, it has not become a problem for him. He has not reached that point of
maturity where sex becomes significant. Wait! When he begins to inquire, when he
matures and when he asks questions, then tell him. And never tell more than he can
understand, because that more will become a burden on his head. It is the same with the
phenomenon of meditation.

You can be taught only about methods, not about results -- that is taking a jump. And
without getting a foothold on the method, taking the jump is simply a cerebral affair, a
mental affair. And then you will always miss the method.
It is like small children doing arithmetic. They can always go to the back of the book and
can know the answer. The answer is there; at the back of the book, the answers are given.
They can look at the question, then they can go to the back and know the answer. And
once a child knows the answer it is very difficult for him to learn the method, because
there seems to be no need. When he already knows the answer, there is no need.
And really, he will do the whole thing in reverse order.
Then through any false, pseudo method he will arrive at the answer. He knows the real
thing, he knows the answer, so he can arrive at the answer by just creating a false
method. And this happens so much in religion that it seems, as far as religion is
concerned, everyone is just doing what children do.
The answer is not good for you. The question is there, the method is there, and the
answer must be reached by you. No one else should give you the answer. The real
teachers do not help you to know the answer before the process is done, they simply help
you to go through the process. In fact, even if you have known somehow, even if you
have stolen some answer from somewhere, they will say that this is wrong. It may not be
wrong, but they will say, ""This is wrong. Throw this -- it is not needed."" They will debar
you from knowing the answer before you really come to know it. That is why no answer
is given.
Shiva's beloved, Devi, has asked him questions. He is giving simple methods. The
question is there, the method is there. The answer is left for you to work out, to live out.
So remember, centering is the method, not the result. The result is cosmic, oceanic
experience. There is no center then.

&gt; If you want to avoid the suffering of life and death, you must know the way to Buddhahood this very moment. The way to Buddhahood is to realize your own mind. Your own mind is the original face before the birth of your parents; consequently before your own birth. It is the original nature of all beings that has remained unchanged up to the present.

&gt; This mind is originally pure. It was not born with this body and does not die with its extinction. What's more, it cannot be distinguished as male or female, or shaped as good or bad. It is beyond any comparison so we call it Buddha-nature. Moreover, like waves from the ocean, the many thoughts arise out of this original nature. They are like reflections from a mirror. That's why you must first see where thoughts come from if you want to understand your mind. So whether asleep or awake, standing or sitting, you must question deeply, ""What is this mind?"" The deep desire to realize this is called religious practice, training, aspiration, or the Wayseeking mind. Questioning your mind in this manner is also referred to as *zazen*.

&gt; When you ask yourself who the master is who at this very moment sees with the eyes, hears with the ears, raises the hands, moves the feet, you realize that all these operations are the work of your mind. But you don't know why it works that way. You may say it doesn't exist, but it is clear that something is freely functioning. You may say it does exist, but you can't see it.

&gt; Now when this [inquiry] feels insurmountable and you are unable to understand anything, when you have exhausted all ideas and don't know where to turn, you are proceeding correctly.

&gt;Don't let yourself fall back at this time. As you pursue this inquiry more deeply, your piercing doubt will penetrate to the depths, ripping through to the bottom, and you will no longer question the fact that your mind is Buddha. There will be no [world of] life and death to despise and no truth to seek. The world of the great void will be the one mind.

A quote as an example of what I liked:

&gt; Taoist practices eschews mind techniques past the most basic stuff, and all mind techniques are always concerned with going towards Wuji, for a simple reason: It's too easy to walk the fire and see the ghost, that is, go plain mad, when you do post-heaven stuff with the mind. Whether psychotic or just religious, doesn't matter.

And one more: 

&gt; There's no ""before the big bang"". The very notion of time is what makes the ""before your parents were born"" thing so confusing. Time is non-existent, even physically. We just choose to name an axis entropy tends to increase in (but isn't guaranteed to, see quantum mechanics) ""time"".

&gt; What's meant is your pre-heaven self. ""pre"" isn't a measure of time, here, but the question of your identity in wuji vs. your identity in taiji/bagua: Your post-heaven self. The potential vs. the realisation of the potential. Are you as human as a bramblebush in the forest is a thicket? Are you as human as a lion in the Serengeti is a lion, or are you as human as a human in a cage on wheels in the Serengeti?

Unfortunately I felt a bit out of depth for that discussion, since /u/barsoap seemed to apply a lot of (probably) Taoist terms that I am not familiar with. (E.g. ""post-heaven"", ""Wuji"", ""bagua"", ""mind techniques"".)

I'm sure several of you, not just /u/barsoap, has experience with both philosophies/religions. I would like to know what would you share with an outsider knowledgeable in Zen in order to get him more interested in some aspects of Taoism. What insights have you gained that can be either related to Zen or something that Zen does not address at all? What interesting books that are approachable have you read? That sort of thing.

Thank you for any contributions. If you have any friends in /r/taoism that may be knowledgeable, please let them know.

I know it sounds a bit like ""let's convert Zen people to Taoism"" but this is not something I aim to do; my intent is only to get to know Taoism better and extend a previous discussion that interested me.

I would like to keep it Zen-related by assuming that the average reader already has experience with Zen teaching and practice. I am sure there are things to say to a complete layperson to get them interested but that is a different matter.

If you want, you can also share negative experiences: what turned you away from Tao (and perhaps returned you back to Zen). I would like to keep it without too much religion-bashing but I am interested in what people experienced.

Just detach from gross mental objects, and whatever subtle ones there are will naturally clear out, and eventually you will come to understand spontaneously; you don’t need to seek.

This is called putting conceptualization to rest and forgetting mental objects, not being a partner to the dusts. This is why the ineffable message of Zen is to be understood on one’s own. I have no Zen for you to study, no Doctrine for you to discuss. I just want you to tune in on your own.

The only essential thing in learning Zen is to forget mental objects and stop rumination. This is the message of Zen since time immemorial. Did not one of the Patriarchs say, “Freedom from thoughts is the source, freedom from appearances is the substance”? If you just shout and clap, when will you ever be done?""

In the last two sessions, we featured practioners from the [Rinzai][kushin] and [Soto][kounfranz] schools of Zen. Thanks once more to  our volunteers and to everybody who participated in the session!  Now, having gotten a taste of these two Japanese traditions – with hopefully more to come in the future – let's try looking a little further afield and see how things like from a Korean perspective.  

Our next volunteer comes from the Kwan-Um school of Zen, and has been serving as the abbot of [Cambridge Zen Center][czc] in Massachusetts since April 2010.  You might be familiar with the CZC from their really interesting series of [videos][czc-videos] on YouTube (for example, on [enlightenment][video-light] and [sangha][video-sangha]).  If you saw a video you liked and wanted to dig deeper, now's your chance! Abbot Tom Johnson has generously agreed to take on some our /r/zen Student to Student questions.

So, are you only don't knowing?  How about asking Abbot Tom a question?

## How this works

*One Monk, One Month, One Question.*

1. (You) reply to this post, with questions about Zen for our volunteer.
2. We collect questions for 2 or 3 days
3. On 2 June, the volunteer chooses one of these questions, for example, the top-voted one or one they find particularly interesting
4. By 5 June, they answer the question (or questions, if time permits)
5. We post and archive the answer(s).

I encourage any form of Zazen for at least 20 min a day (Split sessions into 2 x 10 min, if you have to).

I encourage any discussion, questions, feedback, or friendly encouragement and talk among those who are in the group. I am sure we have some long-term practitioners who can help with beginner questions.

So, when you're not on here or at work or whatever, what do you like to do?

I have some stuff that I dabble in, but I've never really found any kind of sustainable drive to do anything since I got sick of programming a bunch of years ago. I used to be seriously INTO that, kept me up all night, I was manic. Nowadays I just ""try to think of projects,"" and sometimes start one but only get to the very first little obstacle and then I go ""ugh, this shit is boring, wah wah wah"" and go off to do zazen or write some stupid crap on reddit.

I also somewhat enjoy playing music, but I feel a bit stupid singing other peoples' crazy songs ten thousand times, and I'm not really that good at singing, and I always forget where my guitar pick is and end up playing with a folded piece of paper and hurt my finger. Actually if you had tips on good songs to do with just my voice and guitar, and that doesn't make me pretend to be a cowboy or something, that'd be nice, too. One of my favorite songs to do is ""Jesus, Etc"" by Wilco, and also some different songs by the Mountain Goats.

Writing is sort of fun, too, when I have some kind of reason for it -- like, I enjoy writing comments on reddit so much that I'd rather do that than most other things -- but it sort of feels like the stuff I'd most like to talk about isn't stuff that's being discussed in any of the forums I've found, and I've tried writing blog entries and stuff, but when I'm not in a specific, time-bound dialogue, I just end up confused and unmotivated. 

But I got a nice fountain pen (a super cheap one), and it's the first pen I've ever tried that actually feels right to write with, so I'm enjoying that, but I really hate to write a journal, because the actual events of my daily life are so extremely banal and repetitive that I just have to fill it up with expounding on negative emotions that I didn't even feel before I opened up the old diary.

I guess what I'm saying is that while Zen is awesome and all, and I don't feel as extremely ""fundamentally"" dissatisfied and confused as I used to feel, my life project in its more ""external"" or ""worldly"" aspects is kind of desperately withering in a way that internally just feels sort of intensely empty. Like most everything is just a big ado about nothing, that my internal deep motivations find no traction or use in the external world, that I'm --

Wait, I really only meant to ask for some tips on fun things to do. See, that's how I function. I just get lost from the issue at hand and fly off into this abstract thought-based quarter-life-crisis hell realm.

Blyth's work as both men acknowledge their debt to the works of D.T. Suzuki.  Where Blyth is interested in the lineage of pointing, Watts is interested in the historical development of the culture and conception of Zen.  Also, like Blyth, Watts does not claim to speak for Zen Masters.  Where Blyth discusses the pointing of the Masters, Watts describes what he has learned from observing and interviewing those in the Zen community over a period of many years.

.

The Way of Zen discusses Taoism and Buddhism before Bodhidharma, giving us Watts view on both of these as well as a more academic description of Buddhist religious beliefs.

.

Watts discusses the history of Zen and Zen teaching, the modern realities of Zen monasteries and Zen rituals and teaching in Soto and Rinzai schools.  With this as a background it is clear why Blyth was concerned that Zen is in danger of dying out.


.

Amidst all this Watts says, ""Nowhere in doctrine of all the T'ang masters have I been able to find any instructions in or recommendation of the type of za-zen which is today the principle occupation of Zen monks.  On the contrary, the practice is discussed time after time in the apparently negative fashion...""  He touches on this conclusion several times in a cautious way when he relates his views on modern Zen practices, rituals, and traditions.

.

Watts has favorites in the lineage of Zen pointing, but he seems particularly drawn to one koan which may be described as the center of his conception of Zen:

&gt; The Ch'uan Teng Lu records a fascinating encounter between Tao-hsin and the sage Fa-yung, who lived in a lonely temple on Mount Niu-t'ou, and was so holy that birds used to bring him offerings as flowers.  As the two men were talking, a wild animal roared close by, and Tao-hsin jumped.  Fa-yung commented, ""I see it is still with you!"" -referring, of course, to the instinctive ""passion"" of fright.  Shortly afterwards, while he was for a moment unobserved, Tao-hsin wrote the Chinese character for ""Buddha"" on the rock where Fa-yung was accustomed to sit.  When Fa-yung returned to sit down again, he saw the sacred Name and hesitated to sit.  ""I see,"" said Tao-hsin, ""it is still with you!""

To celebrate the upcoming [Bodhi Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhi_Day),
I'd like to announce the first of our
[/r/zen Student to Student Sessions](http://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/10zcuz/rzen_student_to_student_sessions_help_wanted/)

## How this works

1. Every month, I will announce the next next monk, nun, or priest in our volunteer queue, providing as much biographical information as they are comfortable sharing on the internet.

2. You (/r/zen) ask and vote on questions on the thread.

3. After one week, I pass the top three questions to our volunteer.

4. The volunteer replies to one of them, and if needed, I post the answer in a new thread


## Volunteer 1: Taisen Gordon-Finlayson (Soto, White Plum)

(Apologies for the transposition in the title.  It's Fin*lay*son)

Without further ado, I'd like to introduce Alasdair who has bravely agreed to go first (thanks!).  Alasdair is a UK-based monk in the White Plum asanga, and has been practising for over twenty years.  Here's a little more from Alasdair about himself: 

* Name:  Alasdair Taisen Gordon-Finlayson ([photo](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-2lSdGQPDbno/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAFs/H2K8tdAqdXc/s250-c-k/photo.jpg)) (/u/alasdairgf)
* Lineage:  StoneWater Zen (White Plum Asanga, Soto Zen)
* Length of practice: Since 1991
* Background:  I was always drawn to the Big Questions, and considering I grew up in South Africa, I was very lucky to have been introduced to a Zen teacher – SA wasn’t exactly a hotbed of Buddhism in the early 1990s!  She was the late Taiho Kyogen Roshi, and I somehow knew that under her instruction I had found if not the answers to the questions, then at least a way of asking.  It wasn’t until much later, after I returned to the UK, that I met my current teacher, Keizan Scott Sensei, with whom I took shukke tokudo in April last year (2011). I’ve always been curious about why I felt so at home in the Zen context, and made it the topic of my MSc and recently completed PhD degrees.  (The answer is too dull &amp; long to include here!)  Recently, I have moved to Northampton in the UK and have started a local Zen group, which brings its own rewards and challenges.  Online, I’m a moderator (though not currently active) at Zen Forum International, and also a moderator for the Soto Zen, Zen in the UK and StoneWater Zen Facebook groups.

Ewk is a longtime contributor to the Zen Reddit, and a controversial figure with a lot of people finding value in his words, and also a lot of people strongly disagreeing with him (sometimes simultaneously). 

For the benefit of newcomers to /r/zen and particularly in preparation for our [Student to Student sessions](http://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/10zcuz/rzen_student_to_student_sessions_help_wanted/), I thought I should try to capture a bit more of the context and range of his contributions, the hope being that people have a better feel for where he's coming from and maybe be less troubled by him.

But I am trying to say that at some point you have to let it all go, even if you decide to still meditate every day or read sutras.

Edit: Just to clarify, not trying to tell people they need to stop sitting or abandoned their teacher and/or sangha. Just saying that these things can become another attachment or even a crutch.

Water is pure no matter what is in it.” The child commented, “Then, father, you do not need to practice meditation.” The father said. “I practice it anyway.”

To attain pure mind, you begin by keeping your mind as pure as water. You create the karma that causes you to fall into hell because of the impurities in your mind. The only reason you go to hell is that the impurities in your mind raise hell with you. The experiences you undergo cause your karma, and this karma takes place in your mind. It has no other place. The karma that you create does not stay in the sky or on the earth, or under the earth, but in your mind. Usually the working part of the mind and the stuff in it are considered together in Buddhism – mind and mind-stuff. If mind is like pure water, then mind-stuff is like ashes in it.

When the everyday mind that has mind-stuff in it relates to something else, the mind-stuff churns in the mind-water and we call it impure: “I hate her, I love him, I wish I had that...” There is no hell under the earth to which you will go when you die. There is just this impure mind. This impure mind is hell.

In meditation, we keep our mind quiet and exterminate the mind-stuff to attain pure mind-power. In the morning, the mind-stuff shakes up when you go out and associate with people, but in the evening when you come home, you keep your mind quiet and let the mind-stuff settle down. When you have practiced this settling down of the mine-stuff, even though your mind is full of mind-stuff, you can feel that the nature of mind is originally pure. The great ocean that produces Mount Sumeru, the world, is not always clean and pure on the surface, but in the depths all is pure. The great man's mind is like that. Its nature is always pure. But the ordinary man's mind doesn't know that pure condition of mind.

In the daytime, the ordinary man agitates his mind. At night, even when he is sleeping, it is just the same. He dreams, hates, loves, possesses as in the daytime. There is no time that the mind settles down and there is clear water on top.

It is best to associate with people who have pure minds. If you associate with someone who has an impure mind, whatever word you say will be twisted. No word can go into his mind smoothly. Whatever you say, the impure mind will twist, while the pure-minded person will see through to your meaning immediately. You have no trouble when you associate with pure-minded people.

There are many religions in the world, but all emphasize the simple and pure mind. This is the only useful part of religion. In Christianity, in prayer, you confess everything to God and your mind becomes pure. In Buddhism, you meditate. Perhaps it will come into your mind: “He insulted me today.” You shake your head and forget about it. Or: “I lost all my money today.” And you shake your head and forget that, too.

I recognize this when I do programming (which is my work). If I surf into Facebook or Reddit on a break the impressions from those sites will linger for quite a long time in my consciousness, leeching away focus from my actual programming task.

I think this can be applied in zen. When we sit down, we only do one thing - we are ourselves. It feels very nice to do one thing, and do it properly, and with all my attention. But why limit ourselves to this? When I do the dishes, or prepare food, I try to only do that - do the dishes, prepare food. Nothing else.

I'm curious about Zen and its practices; I've read a couple of books that have made me curious, and I think there's something to come from those practices as a way to look at problems and events differently. I come from a very pragmatic/rational/skeptical background (I'm a software engineer, on top of that) but the way in which I've learned some areas such as artificial intelligence and machine learning seem to gain insight from the ""Zen point of view"" have made me think I could gain something from it as well, as an alternative problem solving framework.

However, I work from 8 to 5, and after that I either go to the gym or university, as I'm working on my masters. Therefor, I really can't commit to anything that eats through much of that time. My question is; indubitably, to fully understand and be a part of it, it requires dedication, but in your experience, what can I do to not devout much time to it, yet gain even a little insight from it? Would you recommend any book I can read? What's your opinion on ""casually"" indulging in ""Zen"" practices, Zazen and whatnot? Would that be a waste of time, even with a book/online guide/whatever? Alternatively is there any good site to learn about Zen? 

Thanks in advance

The teachings of the enlightened Buddha contain much, it teaches many to live righteously, to avoid evil.

I feel close to zen and zen teaching, but do not do any formal practice. I enjoy meditation and talking about this stuff, but haven't felt a pull to go to my local zen center. 

My curiosity with religion and ""truth"" began when I was pretty young, and I've been in and out of Catholic church for years. I read a ton of books as a teenager (Richard Bach and other ""creating your reality"" type books). I have a couple of kids now and we still go to church and have good conversations about god and spirituality. I don't believe much of it, but I like that my kids are learning about our heritage. I used to spit fire about the church, but I've made peace with it.

I discovered [Adyashanti](http://www.adyashanti.org) a few years back, and learned most of what I know about zen from listening to his satsangs. A big catalyst to my progress was my wife leaving me 4 years ago (after 12 years of marriage). Stripped of my primary identity, I turned to zen. And found nothing :P

So after years of resisting, I've been trying to slow down and just let everything fall apart. All of my knots of belief and conditioning, all the little patterns and recurring emotions.. I have been blessed with a good job that allows me a lot of time to sit and journal, so that has helped get me through some mental blocks. 

It's been weird for me since none of my friends or family is interested in zen or similar teachings. 

Speaking of work, I need to get back to it!

By goals, I don't mean ""get this job"" or ""make this much money"". Rather, they are a complete image of how I want my life to be. For example, I may see a role model, and say ""Oh I want to live like this person in the non-immediate future."" I feel that these goals are really just a desire, and that this form of desire can often be bad. 

Some days, they cause me to feel a major sense of ennui and depression. I suppose the obvious solution would be to end this form of desire, but at the same time these goals are what give me the motivation to remain alive. Sometimes, when I think that I can't do something, or had enough, I use my goals to keep going. In some way, I think they are an integral part of me. 

What does Zen have to say about this type of attachment? Is it feasible, and positive to give it up? Or should these type of desires be kept in moderation?

I'm interested in how humans handle the knowledge of their mortality, ways they try to deny their mortality, or ways that people accept their mortality. To me, one of the worst things ever is hearing about a person who's in their 80's and doesn't want to die; however, I've also though heard about people in their 30's who are perfectly okay with the idea of dying. 

So I guess you could say, I have an ""agenda"" for studying zen. I want to be able to gracefully accept my own mortality; and I feel that constantly reminding myself of my mortality helps me feel human. At the same time though, I feel it can paralyze me (and others) in fear. 

But the more I think about Zen, study it, and read about ""masters"", the more I understand (or think I understand) Zen as being okay and accepting all emotions. It's about living with and accepting the fact that humans are afraid of death and that it's okay to grieve when one dies. 

I'm mostly looking for a second opinion. How has your practice changed your ideas and attitudes towards death? I know we're supposed to sit without gaining anything, but if I'm brutally honest with myself, my motivation for sitting is to overcome my fears.

Edit: I just was thinking about it. The reason I was drawn to Zen, and Buddhism in general, was because of the ideas of emptiness and how everything is impermanent. Those are central ideas in Buddhism; yet, I still think my understanding of them are pretty shallow.

    its substance is void of relative or absolute.
    Golden waves all around,
    Zen is constant, in action or stillness.
    Thoughts arise, thoughts disappear;
    don't try to shut them off.
    Let them flow spontaneously –
    what has ever arisen and vanished?
    When arising and vanishing quiet down,
    there appears the great Zen master;
    sitting, reclining, walking around,
    there's never an interruption.
    When meditating, why not sit?
    When sitting, why not meditate?
    Only when you have understood this way
    is it called sitting meditation.
    Who is it that sits? What is meditation?
    To try to seat it
    is using Buddha to look for Buddha.
    Buddha need not be sought;
    seeking takes you further away.
    In sitting, you do not look at yourself;
    meditation is not an external art.
    At first, the mind is noisy and unruly;
    there is still no choice but to shift it back.
    That is why there are many methods
    to teach it quiet observation.
    When you sit up and gather your spirit,
    at first it scatters helter-skelter;
    over a period of time, eventually it calms down,
    opening and freeing the six senses.
    When the six senses rest a bit,
    discrimination occurs therein.
    As soon as discrimination occurs,
    it seems to produce arising and vanishing.
    The transformations of arising and vanishing
    come from manifestations of one's own mind.
    Put your own mind to use to look back once:
    once you've returned, no need to do it again;
    you wear a halo of light on your head.
    The spiritual flames leap and shine,
    unobstructed in any state of mind,
    all-inclusive, all-pervasive;
    birth and death forever cease.
    A single grain of restorative elixir
    turns gold into liquid;
    acquired pollution of body and mind
    have no way to get through.
    Confusion and enlightenment are temporarily explained;
    stop discussing opposition and accord.
    When I think carefully of olden days
    when I sat coolly seeking,
    though it's nothing different,
    it was quite a mess.
    You can turn from ordinary mortal to sage
    in an instant, but no one believes.
    All over the earth is unclarity;
    best be very careful.
    If it happens you do not know,
    then sit up straight and think;
    one day you'll bump into it.
    This I humbly hope.

1) What do you think is the most important purpose of Zen?

2) In what way might Zen insight help *you personally?* 





* I'm trying to find out whether or not a large enough number of redditors are interested in the *application* of Zen (rather than Zen theory) to make creating a subreddit devoted exclusively to this aspect of Zen worth the time &amp; effort.

If such a subreddit is created, participation will be *by invitation only* because its focus will be only on the *use of Zen in real life* and not at all on Zen as a subject of mere intellectual speculation. The answers to this post will be used to determine which redditors, if any, are currently interested in using Zen to solve their real life problems.

I have read a fair amount of the discussions in past posts about non-attachment/detachment, but it seemed to be primarily about thoughts and desires as they occur internally, often in the context of meditation.  What I am inquiring about today is how, from a zen perspective do the ideas of non-attachment,  not caring, detachment and indifference differ in meaning and actual action. 
 
Optional Fun part: if you are so inclined, pretend you are an enlightened master (which you are already but don't know it yet:) and  write something. Then write something from your perspective as a zen student. 
 
Example:
Zen master: Thoughts are like birds. They fly in and flutter about, I watch them, then after a short time they fly away. I am not attached to them staying or going, they behave according to their nature. It's not that I don't care that the thoughts are there, for they are essential to functioning. I am indifferent to their quality or nature as they arise from the same wellspring. Zen is neither action or inaction thus nothing to be attached or non-attached to, detached from or indifferent to, caring or uncaring about.  
 
Zen student: Thoughts are like actions in that they happen. I go for a walk and see a dead bird on the path. I move the bird off of the patch and perhaps honor what it is. I am not attached to the idea of it being alive because it is already dead, I am not detached to its deadness because there is nothing to be done. I am indifferent, but that does not mean not-caring. I care that it was another living being at one time and honor it as such by moving it off of the path so it will not get squished. When I continue on my way I no longer think about the bird.


Have fun!

After reading a small book by the Vietnamese Zen Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh called ""True Love: A Practice for Awakening the Heart"", though, I've decided to begin again. Since I feel like this is essentially starting anew again, following my returning session now, I thought it would be helpful to write this to those of us who find difficulty in quieting our restless mind, especially those who are new to meditation or are considering returning to meditation after a long absence.

As I sat breathing with my eyes closed, I began meditating on these words (taken loosely from the book I just mentioned): 

*While inhaling, ""Breathe... I am breathing in."" And while exhaling, ""Breathe... I am breathing out.""* 

As soon as I began, I realized how unquiet, restless, and out of my control my mind was. I could hardly keep mindful attention and awareness on my breathing without thinking about the dozens, or hundreds, of possible other things I could be thinking or doing. 

After a minute or two, I noticed a small clock ticking, and I couldn't help but be distracted by it, so I took it off the hook on the wall, set it in my bedroom where I wouldn't be able to hear it, and returned to meditating.

Several minutes in, many times, while my mind wandered, I caught myself thinking, ""Breathe... I am breathing out,"" when I was actually breathing in! I realized I was merely trying to memorize the words without actually paying attention to what I was doing and thinking.

After about 10 minutes, this happened less and less, and I began to regain control of my mind, and become more aware of what I was thinking and doing. 

After 15 minutes had passed, I could notice when my mind was beginning to wander, acknowledge this lapse in concentration, let the absent thought float away, and return to focusing on my breathing.

After 20 minutes, I was almost completely absorbed, in thought and action, on the words, ""Breathe... I am breathing in. Breathe... I am breathing out,"" and I ended my session there.

I probably have a lot more progress to make in the coming days, or perhaps even weeks, before I can readily sit down and immediately become as absorbed in concentration as I did at the tale end of my session. 

When I feel my mind beginning to wander, I am going to remember to acknowledge the lapse in concentration, allow the absent thought to float away, and return to meditating on my breathing.

Another note: Early on, I noticed that there were times where I became discouraged at my inability to control my focus, so I started to tell myself, ""You aren't doing well. Do better!"" Also, later on, there were times where I became proud at my progress and my ability to maintain focus, so I started to tell myself, ""Well done! You're focusing so well."" You can see the irony in this. By taking my focus off of my breathing, and beginning to focus on whether or not I was ""doing well"", I distracted myself so that focus was impossible! 

It is useless to discourage or congratulate oneself. All that matters is to remain focused on one's breathing and the accompanying words, ""Breathe... I am breathing in. Breathe... I am breathing out.""

*One day, with his travel bag upon his back, he set out from the mountain top, intending to deepen his practice by studying with other Masters elsewhere. Just as he was climbing down, he stubbed his toe on a rock, and it began to bleed and smart terribly. Suddenly he had a deep realization.Thereupon, he said, “This body has no independent existence, so where is the pain coming from?” He then returned to Seppō and told him what had happened.

Seppō asked him, “Is this Shibi the Austere Monk?” Shibi responded, “I have never dared to deceive anyone about that!”
Delighted by this response, Seppō said, “Who could fail to cherish this response? Who could have expressed the Matter more fully?”*

After having reading this it hit me, the unreality of things. The relationship with thought and the sensory world, how it's all just the flow of experience and that neither excludes one another.  
I never understood fully what maya had meant before but after having this realization it seems this term refers to the unreality of being when you cling to ideas and preconceptions. It's not that sensory experience is illusory but that thoughts and ideas can lead us astray from the true nature of things. What is the true nature?

Like:

* when pretty women seem to enjoy my company;
* eating bread, cheese, chips, etc;
* being done with something;
* the sun;
* getting a paycheck;
* being warm;
* drinking tea (related to previous point);
* the effect of coffee, especially on the weekend;
* having cleaned up something;
* making a decent plan;
* making someone I like happy;
* women who like the same kind of music I do;
* feeling professional or virtuous in some way;
* feeling charismatic;
* feeling smart;
* etc.

Dislike:

* bodily distractions like tired eyes, hunger, chapped lips, etc;
* not coming up with something to say;
* dealing with people who are annoying, slow, or just not on my wavelength;
* hearing people mention stupid opinions, especially when sure about them;
* staying up so late I begin to worry about being tired in the morning;
* worrying about stuff like deep down being some kind of terribly flawed/failed person;
* when something I was excited about loses its lustre;
* feeling confused or like I don't know what steps to take;
* when I can't manage to explain something that I actually understand pretty well;
* having to clear my throat;
* having to ask someone to repeat what they just said;
* liking someone but not managing to convey it in a warm and appropriate way;
* etc.

Some things I feel good about liking, feel good about disliking, feel bad about liking, or feel bad about disliking. When there's something I feel good about disliking, the overall feeling is not entirely disagreeable. But when there is a conflict between my feeling and my ""meta-feeling,"" especially when said conflict seems deep or irreconcilable, then I feel something that borders on horror -- it's really uncomfortable.

In a lot of ways, it does seem like the ""spectrum"" I've tried to illustrate here, and the tension between the two different sides, somehow constitute most of what I think of as ""my life"" and ""my personality."" It's like I spend my days being dragged from one side to the other, back and forth, and the more I notice it, the more nauseating the whole experience.

Of course, there's also the fact that my interest in ""Zen"" has added another layer of some kind of dislike of all kinds of liking and disliking, which means that all of the things in the ""Like"" category have a tinge of suspicion and worry.

But for some reason, it also feels like the same process that makes me pay active attention to this liking/disliking process, and makes me notice it quite vividly, also seems to kind of loosen the grip of both polarities. Here, I think there are two aspects. One is emotional equanimity, which mostly seems to have to do with meditation; when I meditate frequently and well, I simply don't get very upset or unhealthily elated.

The other is harder to explain, but I came up with a metaphor when I was in the sauna yesterday: it's like how even though the sauna is very hot, and I feel a lot of warmth on my skin, I sweat, and so on, there's still a sense in which my ""mind"" is neither warm nor cold. The various phenomena called ""warmth"" are very vividly present, but in some sense, they don't ""touch me."" This seems like something that is obviously true, but that I haven't really paid much attention to before I started doing Zen. And in some way it seems like something one might get the idea to call something like ""the ultimate refuge,"" or ""the pure land.""

What do you think? Do you have a lot of likes and dislikes, desires and hates, and so on? What are some of your most prominent ones?

His large audience angered a priest of the Nichiren sect because the adherents had left to hear about Zen. The self-centered Nichiren priest came to the temple, determined to have a debate with Bankei.

&gt;""Nanyue went to him and asked, “Great monastic, what do you intend by doing zazen?” Baso said, “I am intending to be a buddha.” Nanyue picked up a brick and started polishing it. Baso said, “What are you doing?” Nanyue said,”I am trying to make a mirror,” Baso said, “How can you make a mirror by polishing a brick?” Nanyue said, “How can you become a buddha by doing zazen?” 

That got me thinking and the more I thought about it the more I realize that zazen is the best practice. And here is why.

Scholars date birth of Buddha somewhere between 500BCE and 400BCE, but nobody is sure, how can you? Also, it is believed that Buddhas teaching was passed on as an oral tradition and hasn't been committed to writings for over 400 years. So here we are, Zen Buddhism, we know that in Zen we should not label and/or conceptualize things, we should see them for what they are. After reading some texts, I cant help but questions certain teachings and certain writings. Example: Koan system, I cant help but ask myself why? What is the point, isn't it more rationalizations until you come up with something clever? Bankei (Don't know much about him) it is said that his teachings were so simple that he could enlighten crowds of people who came to see him, doesn't that sound a bit religious and ""feel good""? And many other sutras, texts, teachings. My point is, how can we know what the true teaching of Buddha was, how can we be sure?

The answer is zazen. If you think about it, this is as close to the Buddhas teaching as you can get. Or Bodhidharma's, since some people don't like to associate Zen with Buddhism. Buddha meditated for 7 years until he achieved enlightenment but he never stopped meditating after, Bodhidharma was a Bodhisattva but he still meditated for 10 years straight. If we can not get direct guidance and teachings from Buddha then surely we can practice what he practiced. 

My poor analogy is this. If our minds are like muddy water and Buddha spent 7 years meditating and settling his mind so it becomes crystal clear then how can we understand what Zen is if we still have our minds like muddy water, at some point we should settle the mind as well so we can have direct experience. No texts, no koans will get us there but practicing meditation should get as close as possible to the mind of the Buddha.

&gt;It is said that Gautama Buddha gathered his disciples one day for a Dharma talk. When they gathered together, the Buddha was completely silent and some speculated that perhaps the Buddha was tired or ill. The Buddha silently held up and twirled a flower and twinkled his eyes; several of his disciples tried to interpret what this meant, though none of them were correct. One of the Buddha’s disciples, Mahākāśyapa, silently gazed at the flower and broke into a broad smile. The Buddha then acknowledged Mahākāśyapa’s insight by saying the following:
&gt;” I possess the true Dharma eye, the marvelous mind of Nirvāṇa, the true form of the formless, the subtle Dharma gate that does not rest on words or letters but is a special transmission outside of the scriptures.

Maybe my impression of Zen is completely incorrect, but I think what attracted me to it when compared with other Mahayana schools of Buddhism is the lack of complex ceremonies, prayers, chanting and overall ""worship"".  I'm assuming Zen altars are generally more simplistic when compared with, say, Tibetan altars, but having an altar of any sort seems a bit like worship to me.

&gt; We will see all the redoubtable members of the younger generation - people gifted with outstanding talent, who have it in them to become great Dharma pillars worthy to stand shoulder to shoulder with the celebrated Zen figures of the past - traipsing along after half-dead old duffers, sitting in the shade with listless old grannies, dropping their heads and closing their eyes and intoning endless choruses of nembutsu ... whose children will be found to carry on the vital pulse of buddha-wisdom ? Who will become the cool, refreshing shade trees to provide refuge for people in the latter day ? All the authentic customs and traditions of the Zen school will disappear. The seeds of buddhahood will wither, turn hard and dry.


While reading the presented quote, I couldn't help but perceive what to me seemed as numerous separations, labels and judgements in the way those words were uttered. Although I'm aware that it is not possible to experience let alone appropiate to judge Hakuin's teachings based solely on a couple of quotes, I would like to read your thoughts on his teachings. Isn't advocating for the protection or validity of something which he calls the ""authentic Zen tradition"" a form of clinging and duality ?. 


What is there to protect ?, what if ""*All the authentic customs and traditions of the Zen school will disappear. The seeds of buddhahood will wither, turn hard and dry.*"" ?.

I would like to share with you the last part of our discussion, because it's baffled me, and seeing this is a Zen community, I'd like to see the different inputs, especially from any well-versed/knowledgeable people/masters(?) that may be out there. It goes as follows:

ME: Isn't Zen about switching off your brain, so to speak? As in, calming the mind to the point where wordless/thoughtless realizations spring into 'being'? Because the process of conceptualization is a hindrance? or in other words, a form of mental gymnastics which, in the end, is meaningless? Such as breathing more life into judgments or categorizations than we're 'supposed' to?

MY UNCLE: No it is not. Though I admit your interpretation is a common misconception. As my Zen teacher said, ""It takes an enormous amount of thinking to prove to the mind once and for all that thinking will get you nowhere."" There is also a great Zen story where a master comes across a student deep in meditation. The master sits down and starts sanding a roofing tile so loudly that eventually the student opens his eyes and says:

""What are you doing Master?"" 

""I am polishing this roofing tile into a mirror,"" the master says. 

""But Master you can never polish a roofing tile into a mirror."" 

""Yes,"" says the master, ""and you can never reach enlightenment through meditation."" 

Zen is about trapping the mind in a contradiction it can never solve. The pressure builds until ""something has to give."" What ""gives"" is the mind itself. If you are interested let me know and I can recommend some books that will ""free your mind"" of the ""misconceptions"" you have about Zen!


My question is: His response seems to be a way too arrogant to be insightful, but is he right? (I don't ask because I'm trying to prove him wrong, or trying to show that I am right, but because I am trying to learn more about Zen).

&gt; *The Disease of Intellect.* [...] If a koan is brought up, you are quick to give your interpretation. Unable to arouse your own Doubt concerning the koan, you don't like it when someone probes you with serious questions. All this is simply your wavering mind; it is not Zen.

&gt; *The Disease of Quiet Meditation.*  If you’re unable to arouse the Doubt when practicing Zen, you may develop an aversion to the world of conditions. Thus you escape to a quiet place and sink into zazen meditation. Empowered by this, you find it quite fascinating. When you have to get up and do something, however, you dislike it. This too is simply your wavering mind; it is not Zen.

&gt; *The Disease of Suppression.* [...] Even though you may practice and understand everything from within this apparently pure and lucid state, once you encounter someone who points out your failure, then emotions and discriminating consciousness pop up like a gourd that was pushed under water. This too is simply your wavering mind; it is not Zen.

&gt; *The Disease of Emptiness.* If you're unable to arouse the Doubt when practicing Zen, you may come to regard the physical and mental worlds as utterly emptied, with nothing at all to cling to and nothing to hold on to. [...] This too is simply your wavering mind; it is not Zen.

&gt; *The Disease of Speculation.* If you're unable to arouse the Doubt when practicing Zen, you may end up speculating with your karmic consciousness over the koans of old, sloppily scratching the surface. [...] Even if you could interpret and explain away each and every one, spewing out the words of old as your own, this too is simply your wavering mind; it is not Zen.

&gt; *The Disease of Acting Out.* [...] You then conclude that you're enlightened and go about eyeballing people, bending an ear, pointing at this and kicking that, thinking it's all the personification of Buddha Dharma. But this too is simply your wavering mind; it is not Zen.

&gt; *The Disease of Self-indulgence.* [...] Meeting others, you sing, dance, and carry on. By the river and under the trees you recite poetry, prattle and laugh. Swaggering about busy places regardless of others, you convince yourself that you've resolved the great matter. [...] Since you're unable to truly practice, you disturb others who are. [...] The worthy teacher recognizes such things as nothing more than ghostly spirits playing games. [...] This is your wavering mind obsessed; if you continue this way, you will fall into demonic paths and commit serious offenses. 

&gt; *The Disease of Putting on Airs.* If you're unable to arouse the Doubt when practicing Zen, you may feel annoyed by the restrictions of the sangha. Some may want to go deep into the mountains where there's no one else around. [...] From a distance they seem dignified, but up close their decadence knows no bounds.

Some of the original meaning is retained, but the English word ""no"" has no necessary connotations of nothingness or non-being, even if in this context the Chinese ""mu"" can normally accurately be translated as a straight ""no"", the loss of these other contexts seems to form a pretty severe mangling. I can only imagine an English speaking Joshu, one with the same understanding and style, could not choose the English word ""no"" as the answer.

This is my problem with the gap of time and culture in Zen writings. Zen is not found in or apart from anything. In trying to convey it, nothing is off limits, because it's hard enough to convey as it is. The speaker, the listener, the cultural context, meanings words could have in other contexts...frequently, you miss one element of this, and a koan reads like unintelligible garbage. Learn one fact, and it makes sense. 

Anyway, one of my pet peeves. I think one of the standard-bearer koans in English is rendered quite poorly, and I can only imagine that the koan in the native language presented to a Chinese speaker would be much more effective than the translated koan is for English speakers. I've wondered if this problem is not why Hakuin found ""what is the sound of one hand clapping?"" so much more effective.

Personally, I think it's time for new Zen. Zen masters who've refused to write anything down or have tried to destroy what's already been written have done their part, but we're still saddled with this historical baggage of often dubious value, which frequently only confuses the issue, rather than clarifies.

Even the most mundane, boring tasks like washing dishes, or entering data, everything we do, if we perceive it as play, then we will not feel tired or fatigued.

As I understand it, to realize work is play is not to actively pursue this realization every single moment; rather, when we walk, we let walk; we let the cooking cook; we let the cleaning clean, and the realization, that this is all play, comes afterwards when we observe what had transpired.

Is perception a separate action, a conscious decision, or something else? And does changing our perspection put a separation between us and reality (I-am-perceiving-this-as-such)?

Part of the problem is that Dogen said so much, it is easy to both appreciate and criticize him.  This quote via today's Dailyzen could appear to agree with the old masters:

The real way circulates everywhere; how could it require practice or enlightenment? The essential teaching is fully available; how could effort be necessary? Furthermore, the entire mirror is free of dust; why take steps to polish it? Nothing is separate from this very place; why journey away? 

And yet, if you miss the mark even by a strand of hair, you are as distant as heaven from earth. If the slightest discrimination occurs, you will be lost in confusion. You could be proud of your understanding and have abundant realization, or acquire outstanding wisdom and attain the way by clarifying the mind. Still, if you are wandering about in your head, you may miss the vital path of letting your body leap.

This, in particular, seems relevant:

&gt; We were delighted that Engler accepted our invitation to be a keynote speaker. His chapter, ""Promises and Perils of the Spiritual Path,"" is a refinement of that speech. Although he covers considerable ground already addressed in the prior piece, he shifts his focus to examine the ways that Western practitioners of Buddhism tend to subvert Buddhist practice by using it to avoid facing issues that are often also the subject of psychotherapy- employing, for example, ""practices like meditation in the service of defense, rather than self-awareness."" He shows just how deeply embedded issues such as avoidance of responsibility and fear of intimacy can be, and how easy it is to escape into new and exotic religious practices. Concrete and incisive, Engler's analysis may be likened to Manjus'ri's sword that cuts in order to heal.

When Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara was practicing the profound Prajna Paramita, he illuminated the Five Skandhas and saw that they are all empty, and he crossed beyond all suffering and difficulty.

Shariputra, form does not differ from emptiness; emptiness does not differ from form. Form itself is emptiness; emptiness itself is form. So too are feeling, cognition, formation, and consciousness.

Shariputra, all Dharmas are empty of characteristics. They are not produced, not destroyed, not defiled, not pure; and they neither increase nor diminish. Therefore, in emptiness there is no form, feeling, cognition, formation, or consciousness; no eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, or mind; no sights, sounds, smells, tastes, objects of touch, or Dharmas; no field of the eyes up to and including no field of mind consciousness; and no ignorance or ending of ignorance, up to and including no old age and death or ending of old age and death. There is no suffering, no accumulating, no extinction, and no Way, and no understanding and no attaining.

Because nothing is attained, the Bodhisattva through reliance on Prajna Paramita is unimpeded in his mind. Because there is no impediment, he is not afraid, and he leaves distorted dream-thinking far behind. Ultimately Nirvana! All Buddhas of the three periods of time attain Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi through reliance on Prajna Paramita. Therefore know that Prajna Paramita is a Great Spiritual Mantra, a Great Bright Mantra, a Supreme Mantra, an Unequalled Mantra. It can remove all suffering; it is genuine and not false. That is why the Mantra of Prajna Paramita was spoken. Recite it like this: Gaté Gaté Paragaté Parasamgaté

Bodhi Svaha!

I'll start. My first introduction to eastern philosophy was when I was very little. It was my father who introduced me to it. I didn't understand any of it at the time and all I remember is his bonsai garden, netsuke collection and various sculpture and zen art paintings. I remember many netsuke, they were amazing pieces of art. There was Budai, Buddha, Gutei and many others, just fascinating. I actually have two that he gave me. (By the way, one piece is an old man with a staff wearing a robe with stars on it, I remember reading somewhere that it was some Chinese sage who was depicted wearing a night sky robe, forgot his name, so if anybody knows, let me know what his name is, its been killing me) I haven't talked to him since I was 6 to/or 9 years old, so whatever was his fascination or experience with eastern thought I would not know. But it is strange, come to think of it, because I am in my mid 20s now and while I always liked philosophy, only in my early 20s I got interested in eastern thought, on my own. Since I like to read and I am information junkie, it is no surprise I am here on r/Zen. But my introduction to Zen came from Lao Tzu, and Tao Te Ching, it is not Zen in particularly but the philosophy of Tao and Wu Wei brought me to Chan and specifically to Japanese Zen. Being inclined to intellectual thought and similar books, I eventually got tired of it because at some point I really thought that there is a logical explanation for everything, but there isnt. My personal life experience taught me that sometimes things are as they are and things happen because they just happen. Zen killed my intellectual superiority and mental gymnastics. Combined with meditation (zazen) it just feels right to me, I do not give it too much thought nor do I try to intellectualize everything anymore in my life. Zen is a humbling experience for me. I try to practice zazen daily (usually 20-30 min but not always and unfortunately not daily), I try to follow the Four Noble Truths, and I try to follow Zen philosophy along with some Taoism mixed up. I haven't tried contacting local Zen center yet because it seems a bit ritualized, which puts me off but there is going to be 3-day retreat in a month so... I am curious about that, definately would like to do it for the experience. My influences are Lao Tzu, Shunryu Suzuki, Bodhidharma and Alan Watts. I haven't studied other texts yet, been pretty busy with school but I have Dogen's book laying around that I need to get through (its hard) and I'd like to read in the future Lin Chi, Nagarjuna, Lotus Sutra, Chuang Tzu, Ikkyu and Siddhartha (I know, I have a big wish list)

I was rereading some D.T. Suzuki, and he mentions that Zen matched the cultures it encountered as it traveled from India, to China, and to Japan. Moreover, it gained things from those cultures. It would fill it's vessel like water does.

From India, the essential idea of Hinduism, stripped down to a culturally neutral, exportable sum.

From China, it absorbed a great deal of Taoist thought, wu wei, and the beginnings of the koan method.

Japan stripped it to bare bones, deemphasized written documents, and refined the koan.

You might dispute what each culture changed. But now Zen is knocking on our door. What do you think the West will add, or remove, from Zen? How will it change? What is the shape of our cup?

""Don't misdirect your efforts. Don't chase around looking for something apart from your own selves. All you have to do is to concentrate on being thoughtless, on doing nothing whatever. No practice. No realization. Doing nothing, the state of no-mind, is the direct path of sudden realization. No practice, no realization - that is the true principle, things as they really are. The enlightened ones themselves, those who possess every attribute of Buddhahood, have called this supreme, unparalleled, right awakening.""
&gt;
People hear this teaching and try to follow it. Choking off their aspirations. Sweeping their minds clean of delusive thoughts. They dedicate themselves solely to doing nothing and to making their minds complete blanks, blissfully unaware that they are doing and thinking a great deal.
&gt;
When a person who has not had kensho reads the Buddhist scriptures, questions his teachers and fellow monks about Buddhism, or practices religious disciplines, he is merely creating the causes of his own illusion - a sure sign that he is still confined within samsara. He tries constantly to keep himself detached in thought and deed, and all the while his thoughts and deeds are attached. He endeavors to be doing nothing all day long, and all the while he is busily doing.
&gt;
But if this same person experiences kensho, everything changes. Although he is constantly thinking and acting, it is totally free and unattached. Although he is engaged in activity around the clock, that activity is, as such, non-activity. This great change is the result of his kensho. It is like water that snakes and cows drink from the same cistern, which becomes deadly venom in one and milk in the other.",,False,,t5_2qhmf,False,,,True,t3_ptjyj,http://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/ptjyj/the_importance_of_kensho/,

&gt;The circle, enso, is a symbol used in Zen for enlightenment, as it is both bounded and boundless.  The 3rd Patriarch, Sosan, says in the Shinjinmei:
&gt;
&gt;&gt; The circle is like the Great Emptiness,
&gt;Nothing lacking, nothing too much.
&gt;
&gt;Especially in the Igyo Sect was the circle used, the handing down of this method [of substituting the circle for speech] being called ensoingi.  It is said to have begun with Chu Kokushi of Nanyo, that is Echu, the disciple of the 6th Patriarch.  He handed it on to Tangen Oshin (Shino), dates unknown, who attended upon Echu for many years.  When Echu died, he prophesied to Tangen that thirty years after his death a srami would appear and propagate his doctrine of the circle.  Much later this prophecy was fulfilled.  
&gt;
&gt;Tangen one day ascended to the pulpit, and Kyozan came out from the monks assembled there, and, drawing a circle, acted as if presenting it to Tangen with outstretched palms, and then stood there with folded hands.  Tangen put his fists one to the other.  Kyozan came forward three paces, and bowed as women bow.  Tangen nodded, and Kyzan made his obeisance.  Afterwards Kyozan went to Isan, showed him the circle, and immediately was confirmed by him.  Kyozan always said, ""I received the form from Tangen, the activity from Isan.""  
&gt;
&gt;Kyozan used the circle to show his own meanings, and test those of his disciples.  He employed the cow circle to express obedience, the Buddha circle to express enthralling; the man circle to express reason, the simple circle to express a willingness to interview someone.
&gt;
&gt;Cases 33 and 69 of the Hekiganroku refer to the enso.

I was reading another Buddhist text recently, it said; ""... you should also know that **""when you see your seeing, the seeing is not the seeing to be seen. Since the former seeing is beyond the latter, the latter cannot reach it.""**

Also, someone [linked to this article](http://ruthlesstruthdotcom.blogspot.com/2013/07/the-devil-in-details.html) recently, which repeated the idea that we are incapable of escaping beyond our minds.

We say, ""Mind is the essence"", ""Awareness substance exists"" or something like that. Or, everything is ""The One Mind and it can't be characterized"". If we can't get out of our minds, are we being fooled by it when we ""see into our true nature""?

In this first wave of expansion, I've been looking for folks with a connection to traditional Zen practice, perhaps even a formal commitment of some sort.  This isn't meant to exclude those of us who approach Zen from other angles; I do very much aim to keep Zen Reddit the kind of place that welcomes a diverse range of perspectives, but at the same time, I'm trying to ensure that the voice of formal Zen isn't lost in the process.  

This wave will hopefully bring us two new moderators.  I've selected one of them now from my first call, and would like now to make a call for a second addition to the team.

First, the new moderator. In the [first call for moderators](http://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/15ww7q/rzen_hits_10k_subscribers_time_to_grow_the_mod/), we had 10 candidates, out of which 2 appear to be both available and have had some sort of sangha connection.  I'd like to introduce [Jigetsu](/u/Jigetsu).  Jigetsu has been practising Soto Zen for a year and a half in the Treeleaf Sangha and has taken up lay ordination in January 2012.  I'll have to confess that on online sangha like Treeleaf wasn't quite what I had in mind initially, but I think I'm coming around to the idea.  It'd be an interesting compromise for one (between formality and diversity), and it could give him some insight into how Zen forums should run.  Let's see how this works out.  Welcome, Jigetsu!

Second, I… err… we are still interested in growing the team.  The role of the moderation team would be to provide

1. sanitation - cleaning the modqueue
2. infrastructure - maintaining the sidebar, wiki, style file…
3. animation - running eg. the koan of the month, student to student session, book club…
4. management - deciding moderator policy

I'm happy to consider applications from all backgrounds, but hoping to find people with a Zen practice, especially from other lineages.  Any volunteers?

But that's the goal of meditation is to unravel the coils of illusion we've adopted through our endless cravings.

Then without even being aware of it, they allow themselves to be conquered by fear. And that fear runs their life with this acceptance that the weight of fear will balance out a fruitful life. Nonsense! *And* unnecessary!

  Be impulsive! If something comes up that hurts someone, or you -- well, *there's* the bull. Get on top and ride it home. Likewise, if something comes up that's positive and peaceful, jump on that and be reckless. 
  
  Anything that governs your interaction with the world, or that comes in between you and your impulsive self is like a decaying road sign that meant something a long time ago for someone and something completely unrelated to anything you will ever come across again.

Sitting down, legs crossed for minutes on end, I can handle, and I seem to enjoy the quiet time and tuning out of noise.

But I need help - my friend who also meditates told me my ultimate goal at this point, since I'm new to meditation, should be to think about nothing and clear my mind. ""don't think, clear your thoughts"" he said, in his minor Mandarin accent.

I can't seem to literally, think about nothing, or ""clear my mind"" - I tend to have a very waunderous mind - my friend, who has done this for quite a long time, said it will come with time. The more I meditate, the better I will do. 

Can you wonderful lads and ladies give me any suggestions at how to be more successfull? 

Much appreciated. :)

I wanted to talk about something I've been wrestling with lately. Many people seem to have this notion of the ""perennial philosophy"", that the world's mystic religions all point toward the same truth. I feel that Zen gets unfairly lumped into this group. I mean, perhaps what they share in common is a breaking down of the ego and a progressive expansion of experience.

But wouldn't a zen practitioner regard these mystic claims about God/deity to be a form of delusion? I've spoken to sufis about the topic, and there seems to be some ambiguity as to what the nature of this God actually is- i.e. it is possibly the ""ground of all being"", an Idea of God beyond even theism, all experience and being itself. But I cannot know for sure if this is actually what mystics are talking about, or if they are genuinely focused on a supernatural deity.

I ask for your opinions on this, because I wonder if Zen and mystic religions really do point toward the same thing. Do they actually have the same goals? Can enlightenment really have the same quality as being in union/absorbed by the divine? Surely this theistic content must charge the experience with a different quality.

Could a person practice Zen and mysticism or are they ultimately leading down different paths, and thus, distracting from each other? It would seem to me that breaking down mental constructs in the tradition of zen would impede the mystic's fixation on God, and likewise, the search for the ""Beloved"" would distract the zen student. Am I wrong in thinking these two approaches are divergent and will not produce the same outcomes?

I live in the Midwest in the United States. I grew up Protestant Christian, and converted Roman Catholic, because that's what my father's side of the family is, I'm part Italian. I've struggled my whole with both these religions. But I have connected with Catholicism the most, and have found a lot of aspects of it that I love.

About 10 years ago when I was around 14-15 I read something, I can't remember exactly what it was, but it had a line that said something to the affect of, ""short defines long, big defines small, and good defines evil."" And in the moment everything seemed different. My whole way of thinking just completely changed, and I just realized that for my entire life I was viewing things in the wrong way. But not knowing anything about Buddhism or what Zen was I just went on with my life with this idea in the back of my mind. Every now and then I would see a picture, or a scene outside, or a sound and it just felt right. It felt like it was perfect. The Earth would seem like it had completely stopped. The feeling only lasted a few seconds and then it would slip away. Or sometimes I would walk around the woods, we had a few acres of wooden land behind my house, and I would walk around a feel as if I was the only person alive and the whole woods, the plants, and animals, were there for me and only me. That everything was just all a gift and I owned nothing and knew nothing. All I did was exists. But these moments would only come a few times a year or so. But I knew nothing of Zen or Buddhism back then. I only wonder what does it all mean.

Now that I have gotten older I have became aware of Buddhism and Zen only from what I have picked up occasionally from TV or the internet. Just like seeing pictures of ""Zen"" books in like Barnes-N-Noble, or seeing stuff about Buddhism on Travel Channel or History Channel. And I have started to wonder if there is room for Zen in my life and mind. I often wonder if I even understand what Zen is, to even say if it is something I am interested in pursuing. Right now I am finishing up my liberal studies degree (I studied poetry and art) and I'm getting ready to start a Masters in Sculpture and I just wonder what it means to be doing this. And how do I go about studying art at the grad level the correct way? Can Zen be a part of my art process? 

I have no conclusion or single direct questions. I just want someone who practices Zen to listen to my story and comment.

1271526220.0,15,self.zen,bscxx,Last night I dreamed of the Buddha's house.,radiomojo,18,3,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/bscxx/last_night_i_dreamed_of_the_buddhas_house/,"I got up this morning and wrote this down.  I am not a practicing Buddhist, but have read about zen and try to include its ideas in my life.  This dream was very vibrant and intense - so I wrote about it.  I share it here to see what your interpretations are and to share mine.




Last night I dreamed of the Buddha's house.   I followed him home from work.  He does work - nearly every day as a gardener (what else).  He drove along the highway in a non-descript car, or at least one that did not lodge in my memory.

 

The turnoff to the Buddha's house was obscured by trees and vines, a small opening in the wall of trees almost imperceptible at highway speed.  He turned suddenly, without warning and exited the highway immediately onto an old two track road via this opening.

 

Just a few short feet from the highway sat his home.  While the grounds and the surrounding yard looked normal, the house itself writhed with change.  It was a mixture of recognize-able architectural elements and natural growing structure.  Trees, vines, columns and beam.  Whole corners shifted moment to moment as the house grew, changed shape, bloomed, died and was reborn.  The general dimensions remained the same and it was small and modest with no ""curb appeal"".  In fact it looked like nothing from the front.  There was not porch or portico, no facade or even windows on the side of the little house facing the street.

 

In the back was the entrance, a small carport for the vehicle and a few key elements.

 

There was a group of chairs arranged in a semi-circle around a fire pit.  There was a small grill for preparing food.  Finally there was a partially shaded altar.

 

The altar caught my attention for I wondered - what would the Buddha have on his altar, himself?

As I approached the altar I saw flowers and candles, a few sticks of incense and a golden statue not of the Buddha as I have seen him but of a plain and unenlightened ancient man.   While a Buddhist temple may have Buddha on their altar, it appeared as if the Buddha has a mortal man on his.

 

The back door opened and the Buddha walked out, unsurprised to see me (even though I had followed him).  As he raised his arms in greeting, I awoke.  This dream was very vivid. I should warn you - it is long. :)



Now - while I consider myself an atheist, there is much about zen I find useful and interesting.   I have some limited exposure to the teachings and stories of Zen so my instinct on the meanings of this dream may well be my brain filling in what I know for interpretation.  But I will include my interpretation here as I wrote it this morning, without any more over thinking (as in looking for deeper meaning in some of it- I found it did not feel ""right"").



The  story and house elements


1) The Buddha works as a Gardner - This did not feel to have anything to do with cultivating men or enlightenment.  It seemed more to me to be about the idea that work was good so the Buddha worked.  He was a gardener because it was work that kept him connected to the rhythm of things, but it was about work as an important part of life.



2) The Buddha drove a non-descript car down the highway - nothing special about the car as the vehicle for transport through life or down the ""path"" was relevant.   The highway is just a modern path and while path's may change in form the function and meaning remain the same.



3) The turn off to his house came suddenly and without warning - Enlightenment happens suddenly.  There is no blinker or signal.  There are no signs.  If one is racing to the destination on the path one will miss it entirely for it is right in front of our face, yet hidden from most.   There was no progression, no off ramp, no surface street transition.   The path keep s going at full speed and the turnoff is instantly different.   Once one knows where it is, one can describe it or guide travelers to it, but only if they agree to look for it. 



4) The Buddha's house is right off the main highway - Enlightenment is not on a far off mountain top or a long journey from here.  It is right there, just off the main path we all race upon.  It is simply a few hundred yards away from the everyday and the path to get there connects directly with our daily commute.



5) The Buddha's house changes moment to moment- Enlightenment is different for every person who sees it.  Each moment is different like each moment is different and ever changing around us.  But all who see it recognize the general shape and function ( a house) even if it is completely different in form and detail for every traveler.



6) There is no facade or porch - what it appears to the public, to the mailman to others is not important.  There is no value in showing off what it is.  The portion that faces the world is simple and plain, because for people to want to visit the house because of it's facade is undesirable. 



7) The house is small - Enlightenment is not a palace nor mansion.  It is not a heavenly paradise or grand reward.   It is shelter from the storm.  It is ""home"".



8)The yard and grounds did not change like the house - The truth is that everything is changing moment to moment, but the world does not seem that way surrounding this house.  It seems ""normal"" which is, if one looks closely, also changing moment to moment. 



Elements in the yard (basics for practice?)


1) the carport - maintain the vehicle - the physical vehicle that you travel in must be sheltered and maintained.  It can be modest.  But that should not be overlooked.



2) The chairs - maintain your connections with people - fellowship and companionship are good.  Time and interaction should be shared and this house should always be ready to receive guests.



3) The grill - maintain sustenance - this was not a small personal grill but a small family size grill.  Sustenance cannot be overlooked but it too should be shared freely.  Plan to not just eat but to cook for many and share in the process.



4) The Altar -maintain meditation- The Buddha did not meditate in front of a Buddha.  Instead he has on the altar a human.  The divinity is in is us and was from the very beginning. The divine power is not in achieving Buddhahood but in that from the very beginning every human has it in them already.

I'm currently reading Thomas Hoover's *The Zen Experience* (which is [on Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34325), as is [his *Zen Culture*](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34324)) and just finished the chapter on Ikkyu. If I recall correctly, I read that Ikkyu, post-enlightenment, began studying with another Zen master whose training had been more rigorous than his prior master's. Why engage in this when already enlightened?

Before Ikkyu, I read that Dogen studied with his master for an additional two years after becoming enlightened (and may have resumed wandering from master to master after that).

Before Dogen, I might have read that Layman Pang did similar (that is wander from master to master post-enlightenment). I might have read about others doing similar, as well as Pang (I read these chapters yesterday so I'm less sure).

Apart from Ikkyu, who indulged in wine and women post-enlightenment, I don't think I've read of someone returning to worldly life post-enlightenment. Wandering seems more common. But why wander from teacher to teacher, post-enlightenment, as a pupil?

All contributions are appreciated, /r/Zen (surely, every person above cannot be dismissed as ""not Zen""). Thanks in advance!

It's time for our fifth student to student session. Our volunteer this month comes by way of suggestion from /u/grass_skirt (many thanks! suggestions for volunteers are very welcome)

From time to time, you may noticed some videos online featuring a bit of street zazen, in front of [fast food restuarant][zazen-public-resto], a [public fountain][zazen-public-water], a [train station][zazen-public-train]. These videos are published by the [Melbourne Zen Centre][mzc], founded by Seikan Čech.

Seikan has been practising for at least 18 years; he ordained as a monk at Antaji under Muhō Nölke and has since gone on to found the MZC as well as the Melbourne Zen Hospice, providing free home care to people with advanced life-limiting illnesses. This makes for a busy schedule!

Seikan has made the room to take on one of our questions; let's make it a good one. It sounds like we have a lot of interesting hooks, be they about his MZC and Hospice work, his time at Antaiji, Zen in Australia, or maybe just anything that happens to be on your mind about Zen and Zen practice in general.  Anything you wanted to ask a Zen monk?  How about firing off a question in the comments?

## How this works

*One Monk, One Month, One Question.*

1. (You) reply to this post, with questions about Zen for our volunteer.
2. We collect questions for a week
3. On 31 July, the volunteer chooses one of these questions, for example, the top-voted one or one they find particularly interesting
4. By 4 Aug, they answer the question.
5. We post and archive the answer.

This month we'll be experimenting with a list of standard questions that we'll try asking at each of sessions (thanks to everybody who posted suggestions).  I'll  follow up with a comment showing our standard selection.

&gt;
&gt;Only if you keep your attention on it will you be able to make a discovery; but as I see, most of you just remain in eyes and ears, seeing and hearing, sensing and feeling - you've already missed the point.  You must find the nondiscriminatory mind without departing from the discriminating mind; find that which has no seeing or hearing without departing from seeing and hearing.
&gt;
&gt;This does not mean that ""no seeing"" is a matter of sitting on a bench with your eyes closed.  You must have nonseeing right in seeing.

To think of good and evil belongs to heaven and hell. To have a Buddha view and a Dharma view is to be confined in two iron mountains. He who realizes it as soon as thought arises is one who exhausts his energy. To sit blankly in quietism is the practice of the dead. If one proceeds, he will go astray from the principle.

In the contemporary approach to meditation, there is such a sharp distinction between ""meditation"" and the rest of life. Meditation is something very specific, formal, and delineated. And this brings the risk that we bring all the ""rubbish of modernity"" as Wallace says -- that is, our drivenness, our neuroticism, our alienation.

Meditation can alienate you from your own mind. This may not be a popular opinion. I sometimes get into arguments with people who strongly insist that there are no possible dangers or downsides to meditation, and that anyone interested in discussing such things must be some kind of heretic or fear-mongerer. But it does seem to me like this is not only possible but quite common.

""How do I meditate?"" ""First, you must learn to sit in the half-lotus position."" Already, meditation has been made into a magic spell, and your mind into an alien entity. When you accept this proposition, you distance yourself from your mind. You begin to think thoughts like: ""I don't have time to meditate... Meditation feels like a chore... I'm bad at meditating...""

This is why I recommend that people begin with sitting down in their favorite armchair with a cup of tea. Why not start there? See what happens. Does your mind race uncomfortably? Well then, that's interesting. What then? Maybe see if the breath is still there. Maybe try a bit of patience. See if you can just have this very basic self-kindness and self-awareness, sitting comfortably with just a cup of tea.",,False,,t5_2qhmf,False,,,True,t3_1df8np,http://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/1df8np/an_opinion_about_meditation/,

""A day without work, is a lost day"" - *Hyakujo*

""While crossing a field, a man found a tiger. He runned away as fast as he could. Right in front of him there was a cliff, in which he falled. But he managed to grab a old vine, and he stayed like that, with the tiger smelling him. Trembling with fear, he looked down and saw another tiger, down there, who were waiting, hungry. The vine was the only thing that was saving his life, but two mouses appeared, and start to gnaw the vine. In that moment, the man noticed the good-looking strawberry next to him. Holding in the vine with a hand, he grabbed the strawberry with the other, and never a strawberry has tasted so good."" - Don't know the author.

""In the morning, before you put your clothes on, burn incense and meditate. Eat at regular breaks and sleep at a regular hour. Always eat with moderation and never eat until you're completely satisfied. Receive your visits with the same attitude you have when you're alone. And, when alone, keep the same attitude when you have visits. Pay attention at what others say and, whatever you say, practice it. When an opportunity arrives, don't let it go, but always think twice before acting. Don't let yourself get perturbed by the past, look at the future. Your attitude must be a fearless hero one, but your heart must be like a child's one, full of love. When resting, at the end of the day, sleep like it is your last sleep. And, when waking up, let immediately the bed out. Like if it is a pair of old shoes."" - Soyen Shaku

""If something like this happens to you, you cannot just stay crying. You have rise your head and work, work hard. If you stop, you lose."" - A Japanese man called Seinchi that created a suspended cultivation of vegetables, a week after he got his house destroyed and lost his dad in the Tsunami that hit the Sendai Plains.

Maybe helpful for those that have gotten stuck in similar ruts as I have.,prunck,14,2,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/1k9or0/some_insights_i_had_tonight_about_nothingness/,"I wanted to share some insights I had tonight while taking my walk.  Obviously the conclusions really can't be described in words, but the train of thought that led there might be useful to over-thinkers like me that are a little too wrapped up in trying to understand the universe rationally.  I also wanted to give you guys a chance to crack open some doors that I might have accidentally shut with these thoughts that might cause me to be trapped in my box of logic.  Sorry if it ends up being a bit long.  It seems the more I try to put the insights into words, the more words are required.

First, some quick background.  I promise I will get to the insight part soon.  

I have always been a 'thinker' type, prone to rely heavily on rationality to make sense of the world.  I grew up to be a software engineer, and in fact, my current spiritual growth came from my attempt to understand morality and philosophy from the point of view of science and logic.  I had known that a lot of conclusions I had drawn from this clean-slate approach were similar to many eastern philosophies, but it wasn't until I had started reading [Gödel, Escher, Bach](http://www.amazon.com/G%C3%B6del-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567) that I became interested in Zen, a subject touched on a few times in the book, particularly Mumon and Joshu and their koans.

A quick aside about the contents of the book, which will be important later (you can skip the next two paragraphs if you've already read the book or are already familiar with its contents): It is fundamentally about [Gödel's incompleteness theorems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems) and the relationship to consciousness/intelligence.  I want to briefly explain what these theorems mean.  I feel this is highly useful ammo for those enlightened people that have to deal with people that use logic to define their lives.  Essentially what it says is that any sufficiently complex axiomatic system is provably either inconsistent, meaning it has contradictions, or incomplete, meaning that not all things that are true in the system are provable.  

What this means is that once you define any set of axioms that can be useful for anything interesting (for the less mathematically inclined, an axiom is a self-evident truth, such as A=A or A+B=B+A from which you can deduce all other theorems), you can immediately know that what you defined can never justify every truth without being self contradictory.  It is from this fundamental incompleteness that springs increasingly unintuitive ideas (negative numbers, irrational numbers, complex numbers, etc.) that are added to our axiomatic repertoire in order to reach the truths that were previously inaccessible.  [This image](http://www.dalank.de/notabene/phil1.html) from the book, which I will reference again in a bit, might be helpful in understanding this.  The reachable truths are merely a specific branching of a set of axioms that you have previously defined.  You add more axioms to reach more truths, but you can never quite prove all of them.

Ok, now back to the story.

So I was out for a walk, not intending to contemplate existence, but merely because I enjoy walking.  Inevitably, possibly due to habit, my mind wandered over to the deeper questions, particularly the one of no-thing-ness.  I hear this term a lot, but its significance has always been slightly out of my grasp.  I couldn't quite work my way past the idea that there is clearly some-thing that exists, because there is an experience that is playing itself out before me that wouldn't be there without a some-thing to be watching it.  And yet, the idea of a some-thing makes no sense, because why should there be something and not nothing?  It seems that it would make more sense for nothing to exist.  I knew nothing and no-thing were different, but i didn't really ""get"" it.

So I took the contrapositive approach and started with the assumption that instead of this some-thing that I can't help but see, there was a more sensible no-thing as the basis for the universe, and build up the universe out of it.  I did this by trying to think about what that no-thing universe would be like to its no-inhabitants.  

Well, obviously there would be none of the familiar things in it.  No trees or cars or people.  No protons or electrons or electromagnetic forces.  It also meant that there was no time or space or interactions either.  There isn't even existence in this no-thing world.  But existence is a thing that is distinct from its opposite, which is also a thing, which means that non-existence also doesn't exist in the no-thing universe.

It was at about that point that something clicked.  This no-thing universe is exactly the universe I live in.  No-thing-ness does not need an original mover because there is no-thing to move.  No-thing is the actual nothing which is the state that it makes the most sense for the universe to be in, because what is true no-thing-ness that doesn't by definition also include any-possible-thing-ness?

I'll try to clarify it a little further with [the image I referenced earlier](http://www.dalank.de/notabene/phil1.html).  We think, because we can't help it, that our universe is the 'truths' in the image, and the things that don't exist or can't exist as the 'falsehoods'.  In actuality, imagine if every pixel in the image, every supposed truth or falsehood, is neither black nor white, but is completely clear and undefined.  This also means that all things are simultaneously true and false, or, in some way, can freely take on either form, and only by selecting a path (not consciously, but just because all paths are simultaneously there anyway and some lead to observers with consciousness which then look back at their universe and deduce the truths that led them there), does existence spring into focus.  

Looking at it this way, Zen makes a lot more sense.  There is nothing that is trying to do anything and nowhere we are going other than the directions we pick for ourselves.  This is the infinite that you are at your core, and it is only because it is in some way possible that there is an ego that has formed for you to observe.  This is why it is called the void and also called infinite.  And when you die, you don't not exist, but you also don't exist.  You no-exist.  But you already no-exist, so the only thing you won't have is the limitations of your ego-self.  But then, who is this ""you"" that wont have them?  

I might have caused more confusion than clarity with this post.  I just wanted to give those that tend to think the same way I do a way out of some thinking-traps that are hard to get out of for the rationally inclined.  Don't listen to my words, because they aren't quite doing it justice, but follow the train of thought and see if you get to the same place.

tl;dr: MU

Quick edit: For those reading this that found it helpful, but didn't read any of the comments, here is your homework:

The object of the game is to ""one-up"" the person you are talking to about Zen, giving the impression that you are infinitely and unbelievably ""more Zen"" than he or she is. 

There are many shrewd strategies and tactics in Zen ""one-upmanship,"" but one of the most widely used (perhaps because it is not so very subtle or hard to master) is the classic ""koan-bludgeon."" This is where you cite or quote a saying by a famous Zen master to dismiss or destroy your opponent's position on any Zen subject whatsoever. In effect, you turn Zen koans into blunt instruments, bludgeons, to bash your opponent's head with. At the same time, you avoid having to use your own words, which might expose you to dreaded ridicule by exposing your own ignorance. Since the Masters said many different things, often contradicting themselves and one another, a well-read Zen student can find endless koan-bludgeons in the various translated anthologies of Chinese Zen. 

Examples would be extraneous, since anybody who has interacted online with any would-be Master or pretentious Zen student has been koan-bludgeoned.

One often hears that no-thought is the ""wrong"" way, while the right way is to let thoughts appear and disappear without holding onto them, ""like clouds in the blue sky.""

The confusion has to do with a stark difference between pre-satori and post-satori Ch'an/Zen training. 

To attain satori, most people have to starve the mind of thoughts. Thus, they have to train in ""no-thought."" 

It is not an esoteric process but it can be hard. It means simply going for certain stretches of time, stretches that gradually become longer and longer, and more and more intense, fully alert but without thoughts (not falling into some sort of trance or stupor.) There are different ways to do this, for example one-pointed concentration and ""choiceless awareness.""

No-thought, when done intensely and straightforwardly and for a long enough period of time (the length of time is different from person to person), leads to the arising of a feeling of ""Great Doubt"" and finally to the big breakthrough called satori. This is inevitable. 

*After* satori, the Ch'an Masters recommended letting thoughts come and go without interference, ""like clouds in the blue sky."" Why? Because having realized everything there is to realize, thoughts seem insignificant, and one is no longer ever tempted to get deeply involved with them.

Thanks for taking part in our third student to student session!  Our session featured Koun Franz, a Soto Zen monk, teacher, and blogger. Koun tackled four of our questions from the community, and from there engaged in us in some in-depth discussion on topics such as practice vs enlightenment, or the relationship between Zen and Dogen's teaching.  It's been extremely interesting reading, and for me made especially enjoyable with Koun's brand of clear, careful writing.  The discussion spans 121 comments in total, and if you're interested in catching up, start perhaps with the Koun's main replies and from there drill down into the ensuing discussions:

Many thanks, Koun!  This has been a great session, and if you do manage to drop by from time to time, say hello. :-)  And thanks once more to those of you who asked questions, or wouldn't let our volunteer get away a “boring diplomatic answer”.  These student to student sessions wouldn't work without your participation.

Redditors who practice in a sangha, I need your help!  I'm looking for more volunteers to participate in future sessions, hopefully from a wide variety of lineages.  Could you talk to one or two senior students from your group about volunteering, maybe showing them the [Student to Student introduction page][s2s] or two [recent][session2] [sessions][session3] as examples?  We are mainly looking for the perspective that comes with intensive and commited practice, so no teaching qualifications required.

His teacher then told the young man that, for realizing complete, irreversible enlightenment, he would need to study under a certain wise old master whose small temple was situated in another part of the country. And so the young man set off to meet the old master. After several weeks of travel, he finally arrived at the remote temple. The sentry told him that all the other monks were working at their daily chores, and sent the young man straightaway to the meditation hall to meet the venerable master.

Entering the meditation hall, the young monk espied an old man doing repeated prostrations to a simple statue of the Buddha, softly chanting the name of Buddha Amida (who saves all sentient beings from suffering). The young man was shocked. Having realized from his teacher the basic truth that the Self or Buddha-nature is formless openness-emptiness, utterly transcendent and all-pervasive, he was a bit disturbed to see the old man apparently still caught up in such “dualistic” practices—ritually bowing to an idol and chanting with devotion to a mythical Buddha.

And so he came up to the aged monk, introduced himself, and, from his truly enlightened perspective, proceeded to lecture the old man on the futility and stupidity of worshiping mere forms. Finally, his brief rant over, he realized that, having traveled such a long way to meet the “master,” he should probably ask the old monk for whatever wisdom he had to share. “So, old man, what can you tell me about full enlightenment?”

In response, the master smiled, said nothing, and resumed sincerely bowing in gratitude before the statue of the Buddha, gently invoking the Name of Amida on behalf of all beings….

And, in a flash, the young man fully understood the way of true spirituality, and he, too, began spontaneously to bow alongside the old master. ",,False,,t5_2qhmf,False,,,True,t3_19gv5x,http://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/19gv5x/storytime_a_wise_old_monk/,

There is [bodhi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhi) and there is [arhatta](http://goo.gl/UMGp7). 

I think it's first important to talk about what arhatta is. Arhatta is an ancient concept that exists in most Indian religions, and it is a status that means ""perfection"" and someone who has attained arhatta is called an arhat. Through perfect practice of meditation, prayer, actions, doctrine, ritual and memorization one can attain the status of arhatta. 

One could say that perfect dogma leads to perfect arhatta. There are arhats of Hinduism, Jainism and Sikh. Although Muslims do not use the word arhat, even they assign levels to people who know various quantities of the Qur'an.

Gautama Buddha came along and saw that the path to arhatta was convoluted in the Hindu religion. He also showed that arhatta was nearly impossible to attain in Hinduism if you were not born to the right family, because of how intrinsically the dogma is tied into the culture. Arhatta in Hinduism is not attainable to everybody, because the wealthy priest class was the gateway to true enlightenment. 

Gautama Buddha however became a buddha, and considered arhats to be fallible. Bodhi is a more awakened state, where one is liberated from the notions of things. [Bodhicitta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhicitta) is the enlightened mind of *a buddha*, which one attains through a spontaneous flash of insight, *not* years of perfect religious adherence. 

It's unlikely that Gautama Buddha intended for people to follow his ideas in the pursuit of arhatta by dogma, and instead I argue that he meant for his followers to reach bodhi and become buddhas themselves. However, as time went on and Buddhism spread people transformed his ideas into a religion that was regaining much of the complexity Gautama Buddha intended to remove by breaking away from Hinduism. Today many sects of Buddhism are *re-Hinduized* if you will, including Tibetan, Theravada, Mahayana and others.

It is impossible to attain bodhi through perfect arhat practice, therefore I propose that this is precisely what zen truly is: the removal of the excess dogma of Buddhism in order to truly reach bodhi and not just arhatta. This is why you hear so many things about what zen is not, not what it is.

It looks like someone just dashed his brush into an ink bottle, rested it briefly on the paper, and then drew the circle quickly in one smooth motion. I have heard (I don't know where from) that eastern philosophies often regard life as cyclical rather than linear, as we have been conditioned to in the west. There are events that keep reoccuring, or that keep causing themselves to occur, or that begin with eachother and influence eachother, and so on. But I wonder about the circle in the sidebar, because it looks a bit like it has a clear beginning. You can see the point where the person put down the brush, and clearly distinguish it from the end of the line, because at the end it just sort of 'teeters out'.

I also think it's interesting how, at the top, the line doesn't really have any body to it, and that it's nearly broken, but that it continues with the same purpose regardless. Even though the body of the line is almost gone, we can still infer in which direction it goes. Also, near the end it's thick! The end and the beginning appears like they should be connected, but they aren't. I don't know. It's funny too, that so much of our life experience and world really is cyclical. I study physics, and fundamentally all physical laws can be divided into two subsets: Those that are reverseable and those that are not. Anyway, I could go on forever. Does anyone know where it comes from, or what it means? Am I the only one who is a bit fascinated by it?

Let's say I finally ""understand"" satori. What happens after that in my daily life? ""Chop wood, carry water"" may be the obvious answer. But as far as I know, after ""understanding"" satori some things seem … useless. If I knew that there is no point in getting physically strong, I'd just plop down on my futon and sit instead of lifting weights. If I knew that there is no point in being smart, I'd stop reading scientific articles. If I knew looking at a tree's leaf is looking into everything, I'd stop looking at beautiful photos. And so on.

But now oftentimes my thoughts and actions reflect a sense of superiority. While I've become more compassionate in how I treat others and myself, I often see that with the compassionate acts comes a sense of accomplishment and egoic satisfaction (after the fact - as far as I can tell, the intent is 'pure'). I seem to be grasping and using zen practice as a means to be a better person, but the more that I practice, the more I see how ridiculous that is. At the same time, the spiritual ego seems to grow, and that scares me.

but i do more than anything else believe in (blank mind) **zazen**, maybe because i have seen it work on myself, my primary motivation for zazen was happiness... in my own little world i refer to zazen as... '**temporary emotional stimulation deprivation exercise**' logically, it would be something similar to standing in a dark room for 60 minutes and then going outside... everything would seen brighter to your eyes
zazen does the same thing to your emotions instead of your eyes... and everything seems more happier.. your brain stress chemicals go down (i suppose) 
{in my understanding **mindfulness** would be more like doing into a DIM room instead of a dark room.. it would still work.. but slower)

**science and technology**, are not yet competent enough to fully understand the human brain... maybe one day they will be... until then.. this is how i understand zazen and happiness

## How to help

If you are a monk/nun/priest (etc) consider signing up!  If you practice in a Zen group, could you ask around to see if anybody wants to participate in the project? Send them this link if it helps.

## How it works

One month, one monk, one question.  Every month, we

1. select a monk from our volunteer queue
2. announce our next monk and collect questions for a week
3. pick ~~one~~ three of the questions and let the volunteer choose one to answer
4. post their reply on this forum and discuss it

## Eligible volunteers

We are looking for senior Zen students with a formal commitment to practice.  Your lineage may call them monks, nuns, priests, dharma teachers in training, etc.  There need not necessarily be any formal authorisation to teach; we are only looking to share perspective from longtime practitioners from a wide variety of lineages.

## How to join

All you have to do is get in touch. If you use Reddit, you can reply on this thread or PM me.  If not, you can also email eric.kow@gmail.com

To save our volunteers the trouble of learning to use Reddit, I will be happy to act as a relay between them and the forum.  You are certainly welcome to join up and participate in the ensuing discussion, but there is no obligation.

## The programme so far

[Will be edited as people join]

So far we have:

1. Soto Zen nun [AZI] [verified]
2. Kwan Um dharma teacher in training (redditor)
3. A Rinzai Zen nun (redditor)
4. Kwan Um dharma teacher (redditor)
5. Soto Zen monk [White Plum, so some Rinzai elements] [verified] (redditor)
6. Soto Zen monk and blogger 

I'll put these in a schedule once we have at least 6 volunteers.

In the Anteroom
A new metaphor/analogy to relate the relative and the absolute
by Gene Poole
http://www3.telus.net/public/sarlo/Yanteroom.htm

Welcome to the anteroom...
where you already are

Beyond that door is the
realm we all speak of

Some of us speak as tho
we are beyond that door

But if we speak, this is
where speaking is done

Beyond the door there
is no speaking

Beyond the door there
is no-one to speak

Beyond the door there
is no-one to speak to

Here in the anteroom we may
speak to each other

If any of us speaks with
pretense of being beyond
the door, everyone but
the speaker understands
that fantasy is being
woven with words.

Everyone knows that those
who speak, in the anteroom,
are in the anteroom.

Yes, some of us in the
anteroom have been beyond
the door. Some of us spend
considerable time beyond the
door.

Some of us come into the
anteroom to speak of what
we see and know, what we
have, what we have lost,
when we have gone thru
the door.

But anyone who speaks here,
is in the anteroom. Anyone
who speaks here, is not
beyond the door. Anyone who
speaks here, stating that
they speak from behind the
door, is mistaken, and the
mistake will be pointed out.

This is the anteroom, and
we may speak here, of anything.

We speak of and point to the
door. We discuss what lies
beyond the door. Now perhaps
we can understand, that if
speaking is being done, that
the speaker is in the anteroom.

To be in the anteroom does not
imply in any way, an inability to
go thru the door. To speak in the
anteroom does not in any way,
qualify or accurately describe or
explain what is beyond the door.

Those of us who speak here,
who know we are in the anteroom,
know that our words do not
emanate from beyond the door.

Some speakers have the habit
of speaking here in the anteroom,
as though they are beyond the door.

Those of us in the anteroom who
have been thru the door, know
that there is no speaking beyond
the door. We may speak here in
the anteroom, of anything, but
to speak as tho we are beyond
while we are here, reveals a
serious schism in the speaker.

Those of us who talk back to those
who speak as tho they are beyond
the door, are typically answered in
words that the speaker imagines are
from beyond the door.

Wake up, you are in the anteroom;
here you may speak. You may
describe immense infinite vistas,
you may bawl endless tears of
gratitude, you may rant on and
on about what concerns you.

Wake up, speaker. If you speak,
this is where you are; here you may
speak.

Realize that you need not formulate
your speech into cosmic diatribe, to
prove you are not here. If you speak,
this is where you are.",,False,,t5_2qhmf,False,,seon,True,t3_10re0w,http://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/10re0w/in_the_anteroom_the_relative_and_the_absolute/,

just like whipping a running horse on.



Once the question mass cracks,

your eyes will open wide and light up the prior time to the universe.



Just stick to hwadu and don't loose it.

Struggling with it, just continue questioning 'What is this ?'



Endless questioning will be like a fireball,

and suddenly you will awake from the long dream of life and death.



Innumerable years of quiet zazen

made the thinking walllike and all the others forgotten.



With keen questioning through millions of thoughts, 

I passed rivers and mountains, not knowing spring had come.



Raise the question of hwadu every way.

Don't keep anything but hwadu.



Nothing is left, so mind is free.


All is silent, so no dust arises.



In a street or thick woods, on a plain or the seashore,


only Nirvana ecstasy is always for him absorbed in hwadu.



Go right ahead without looking elsewhere.



When you take one step forward where you cannot go further,

there will truly not be any matter at all, 

and you can pass through a thorny thicket, even swinging your arms.



The integrity of proud loneliness is lofty

like a great mountain,

and dhyana is free like a sea gull, forever.



Reverse a round desperately with all your strength,

and passion-free world will be clear beyond in and out.


The essence of hwadu lies in great questioning.


When the question defeats the blue eyes of Boddhidharma,

you will be free to kill and revive others, hence notorious all over the world.


The subtlety of zen is from keenness.

Dull questioning cannot solve the life and death problem.



When the question cracks, space will split,

and time will fuse in a beam of cold light.



Be always earnest in pondering over hwadu,

and sweep out worldly idle thoughts by the question.


Only after you let go the hold on the bottomless cliff,

the earth and space will disappear all together.



As the question cracks and passions die suddenly,

there is no shade in every direction all the way.



As the spacious spirits void all directions,


you can stroll about and relax even on the way to Eternal Hell,

accompany various people and pass like a wind.


Liberation by zen practice is not so hard,

only if you turn a thought round instantly.


Where waters end and mountains are passed,

there is no water and no mountain,

yet mountain is mountain and water is water.

I am a bit of a (a lot of a) Zen newbie and I'm trying to figure out where those fit in, if at all. This was spurred on by reading /r/buddhism and a recent post of theirs about how the precepts are rules, not just suggestions. So much of it stunk of religion and not 'enlightenment' or what have you. 

There was talk of, ""These were set out by enlightened beings so we must follow them because they were set out by enlightened beings."" It felt almost, well, scary to me that the precepts were so set in stone just because they were there. I could be (and probably am) coming from the wrong direction on this but why does it matter how much you drink or how often you have sex as long as they are not ruling your life. I would strive to not kill, lie or steal anyway as those require nothing but empathy, which I have.

It just seems weird something that is designed to 'set you free' is so constrained.

&gt;Reverend Upali, do not aggravate further the sins of these two monks. Without perplexing them, relieve their remorse. Reverend Upali, sin is not to be apprehended within, or without, or between the two. Why? The Buddha has said, ""Living beings are afflicted by the passions of thought, and they are purified by the purification of thought.""

&gt;""'Reverend Upali, the mind is neither within nor without, nor is it to be apprehended between the two. Sin is just the same as the mind, and all things are just the same as sin. They do not escape this same reality.

&gt;""'Reverend Upali, this nature of the mind, by virtue of which your mind, reverend, is liberated - does it ever become afflicted?'

&gt;""'Never,' I replied.

&gt;""'Reverend Upali, the minds of all living beings have that very nature. Reverend Upali, passions consist of conceptualizations. The ultimate nonexistence of these conceptualizations and imaginary fabrications - that is the purity that is the intrinsic nature of the mind. Misapprehensions are passions. The ultimate absence of misapprehensions is the intrinsic nature of the mind. The presumption of self is passion. The absence of self is the intrinsic nature of the mind. Reverend Upali, all things are without production, destruction, and duration, like magical illusions, clouds, and lightning; all things are evanescent, not remaining even for an instant; all things are like dreams, hallucinations, and unreal visions; all things are like the reflection of the moon in water and like a mirror-image; they are born of mental construction. Those who know this are called the true upholders of the discipline, and those disciplined in that way are indeed well disciplined.

---

Vimalakirti meets Maitreya, the future Buddha, who is lecturing gods in a heavenly realm about the nonregression of enlightenment.

&gt;Maitreya, the Buddha has prophesied that only one more birth stands between you and unexcelled, perfect enlightenment. What kind of birth does this prophecy concern, Maitreya? Is it past? Is it future? Or is it present? If it is a past birth, it is already finished. If it is a future birth, it will never arrive. If it is a present birth, it does not abide. For the Buddha has declared, ""Bhikshus, in a single moment, you are born, you age, you die, you transmigrate, and you are reborn.""

&gt;""'Then might the prophecy concern birthlessness? But birthlessness applies to the stage of destiny for the ultimate, in which there is neither prophecy nor attainment of perfect enlightenment.

&gt;""'Therefore, Maitreya, is your reality from birth? Or is it from cessation? Your reality as prophesied is not born and does not cease, nor will it be born nor will it cease. Furthermore, your reality is just the same as the reality of all living beings, the reality of all things, and the reality of all the holy ones. If your enlightenment can be prophesied in such a way, so can that of all living beings. Why? Because reality does not consist of duality or of diversity. Maitreya, whenever you attain Buddhahood, which is the perfection of enlightenment, at the same time all living beings will also attain ultimate liberation. Why? The Tathagatas do not enter ultimate liberation until all living beings have entered ultimate liberation. For, since all living beings are utterly liberated, the Tathagatas see them as having the nature of ultimate liberation.

&gt;""'Therefore, Maitreya, do not fool and delude these deities! No one abides in, or regresses from, enlightenment. Maitreya, you should introduce these deities to the repudiation of all discriminative constructions concerning enlightenment.

&gt;""'Enlightenment is perfectly realized neither by the body nor by the mind. Enlightenment is the eradication of all marks. Enlightenment is free of presumptions concerning all objects. Enlightenment is free of the functioning of all intentional thoughts. Enlightenment is the annihilation of all convictions. Enlightenment is free from all discriminative constructions. Enlightenment is free from all vacillation, mentation, and agitation. Enlightenment is not involved in any commitments. Enlightenment is the arrival at detachment, through freedom from all habitual attitudes. The ground of enlightenment is the ultimate realm. Enlightenment is realization of reality. Enlightenment abides at the limit of reality.

&gt;Enlightenment is without duality, since therein are no minds and no things. Enlightenment is equality, since it is equal to infinite space.

&gt;""'Enlightenment is unconstructed, because it is neither born nor destroyed, neither abides nor undergoes any transformation. Enlightenment is the complete knowledge of the thoughts, deeds, and inclinations of all living beings. Enlightenment is not a door for the six media of sense. Enlightenment is unadulterated, since it is free of the passions of the instinctually driven succession of lives. Enlightenment is neither somewhere nor nowhere, abiding in no location or dimension. Enlightenment, not being contained in anything, does not stand in reality. Enlightenment is merely a name and even that name is unmoving. Enlightenment, free of abstention and undertaking, is energyless. There is no agitation in enlightenment, as it is utterly pure by nature. Enlightenment is radiance, pure in essence. Enlightenment is without subjectivity and completely without object. Enlightenment, which penetrates the equality of all things, is undifferentiated. Enlightenment, which is not shown by any example, is incomparable. Enlightenment is subtle, since it is extremely difficult to realize. Enlightenment is all-pervasive, as it has the nature of infinite space. Enlightenment cannot be realized, either physically or mentally. Why? The body is like grass, trees, walls, paths, and hallucinations. And the mind is immaterial, invisible, baseless, and unconscious.'

Some of the ancients had sharp minds; they no sooner heard the Doctrine proclaimed than they hastened to discard all learning. So they were called, ""Sages who, abandoning learning, have come to rest in spontaneity.""
&gt;
&gt;In these days people only seek to stuff themselves with knowledge and deductions, seeking everywhere for book-knowledge and calling this ""Dharma-practice."" They do not know that so much knowledge and deduction have just the contrary effect of piling up obstacles. Merely acquiring a lot of knowledge makes you like a child who gives himself indigestion by gobbling too many curds.
&gt;
&gt;Those who study the Way according to the Three Vehicles are all like this. All you can call them is people who suffer from indigestion. When so-called knowledge and deductions are not digested, they become poisons, for they belong only to the plane of samsara. In the Absolute, there is nothing at all of this kind.
&gt;
&gt;So it is said: ""In the armory of my sovereign, there is no Sword of Thusness."" All the concepts you have formed in the past must be discarded and replaced by void. The canonical teachings of the Three Vehicles are just remedies for temporary needs. They were taught to meet such needs and so are of temporary value and differ one from another. If only this could be understood, there would be no more doubts about it.
&gt;
&gt;Above all it is essential not to select some particular teaching suited to a certain occasion, and, being impressed by its forming part of the written canon, regard it as an immutable concept. Why so? Because in truth there is no unalterable Dharma which the Tathagata (Sanskrit word that the Buddha of the Pali Canon uses when referring to himself) could have preached. People of our sect would never argue that there could be such a thing. We just know how to put all mental activity to rest and thus achieve tranquility. We certainly do not begin by thinking things out and end up in perplexity.

As I receive email replies back, I will post them. So far I have two. 

From Steve Heine:

I appreciate your message My first thought is whether you've approached Taigen Dan Leighton.  He is also very knowledgeable and as the leader of a vibrant Zen center in Chicago may be able to respond to the issues being raised.

I am a little reluctant to weigh in because while internet discussions can be useful, tthat is not necessarily the best venue for suggesting a reorientation toward academic research and highlighting the need to balance things with a scholarly approach.  A lot of good books are out there if people want to read them.

If I understand what you are saying, there was never really a ""versus"" position being taken, although there were indeed disputes about the best way to interpret koans (as minimalist expressions or as expansive and allusive poetic commentaries) as well as meditation (as as an all-encompassing moment of breaktrough or as a steady ongoing pathway).

Regards,

Steven Heine, Professor of Religious Studies and History

And,

Dale Wright:

HI Raymond, and thanks for your note.  I'm afraid I can't even begin to keep up with forum discussions, but I sense that the conversation is spinning in circles.  Were I to venture an opinion, it would be this:

Zen has a long, rich, and diverse history.  It has been many things in response to many different historical and cultural situations.  Trying to make it conform to any of these past scenarios will render it unable to address the present.  The most pressing question is: given all that Zen has been, given the depth and diversity of what it has meant to do Zen, what range of identities and practices would Zen practitioners most effectively cultivate here and now in our time and place in order to evoke experiences of waking up and breaking through our greed, hatred, and delusions?

Here's to mature wisdom and deep compassion.

I have a toilet in my house that is really incredibly irritating. Sometimes it will not flush, for no reason whatsoever. I press the lever and oddly there is no water and I must wait, frustrated, for it to fill. Other times it will flush partially and other times the chain has fallen of the thing in the tank and I have to reattach it getting my arms wet to my elbows. And then it will flush. This has been going on for months and months now, despite my tinkering and careful adjustments. The other day it overflowed and I just about went berserk. This is a very inconsiderate toilet as you can see. The other day, however, I pulled the lever and it flushed, thoroughly, completely, and without issue. I was so surprised and grateful and proud of it, that in that instant a wave of appreciation came over me. We had accomplished something so great and yet so simple that I instinctively and wholeheartedly bowed to the toilet. It was not a deep bow, but a hands together smiling bow to acknowledge that a new level of understanding and respect had suddenly developed. The toilet and I were now of the same mind. I now want to offer the same respectful and appreciative bow to r/zen. In a way the relationship with the toilet has been like my relationship with r/zen. I throw my comments and thoughts in and then tinker and rethink them, trying to make them clear or maybe start over again. Sometimes, I get the clarity of a good flush and other times I just have to deal with the issue. In either case I am grateful for both situations; one is a confidence building event and the other a learning experience. Both are wonderful. So, thank you!

Not sure if it was the influence of society, religion, evolutionary biology, etc., (not that it really matters I guess), but it seemed obvious that one would not want to be a ""chump""...a chump being one who is wronged somehow and doesn't take action to remedy this injustice.

For example, if someone stole from me, I would have a strong desire for retribution...for not doing so would make me a chump.

A lot of thinking/being later I've come to realize that someone allowing themselves to be a chump is actually a stronger person because they do not let external circumstances and concepts dictate how they feel.  If someone were to steal from me today, I would chalk it up to a lesson learned, forgive the person and avoid further contact with the person.  A younger me would label me a coward or chump but today's me thinks that the time/effort in seeking retribution would actually be worse for me than just forgetting it and taking steps to avoid a similar situation in the future.

A lot of this has to do with the buddha's saying about picking up a hot coal to throw at an enemy or the zen master who would not testify against the thief who stole his stuff because he ""gave"" it to the thief.

TLDR: being a chump can be zen


sorry for rambling (incoherent?) post...was going to try to clean it up/clarify, but we're explaining stuff that's bigger than concepts anyway so I won't bother.  Thanks!

&gt;The Fourth Patriarch, following Seng-ts'an, is believed to have been Tao-hsin (579-651). When he came to Seng-ts'an he asked, ""what is the method of liberation?""

&gt;""Who binds you?"" replied Seng-ts'an.

&gt;""No one binds me.""

&gt;""Why then"" asked Seng-ts'an, ""should you seek liberation?"" And this was Tao-hsin's satori. The Ch'uan Teng Lu records a fascinating encounter between Tao-hsin and the sage Fa-yung, who lived in a lonely temple on Mount Niu-t'ou, and was so holy that the birds used to bring him offering of flowers. As the two men were talking, a wild animal roared close by, and Tao-hsin jumped. Fa-yung commented, ""I see it is still with you!"" -- referring, of course, to the instinctive ""passion"" (klesa) of fright. Shortly afterwards, while he was for a moment unobserved, Tao-hsin wrote the Chinese character for ""Buddha"" on the rock where Fa-yung was accustomed to sit. When Fa-yung returned to sit down again, he saw the sacred Name and hesitated to sit. ""I see,"" said Tao-hsin, ""it is still with you!"" At this remark Fa-yung was fully awakened... and the birds never brought any more flowers.

1358616785.0,12,self.zen,16vsva,"Talking About Zen, and the Idea of Crisis",,19,7,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/16vsva/talking_about_zen_and_the_idea_of_crisis/,"I think it’s really interesting to watch and partake in discussion about “Zen.” There are different places where people do this, and it’s always fascinating.

Here’s one aspect of it that I’ve been thinking a little bit about lately. Please don’t hesitate to point out how stupid my thinking on this is -- any kind of discussion, arguing, or calling me a retard, is welcome.

The aspect is: people get upset about it. It can be painful to talk about. Lots of emotions are aroused. There’s frustration, but also curiosity, joy, pride, humility, and so on.

Especially on here, there seems to be a strong current of frustration, that’s not as present -- or as visible -- on some other Zen forums.

I think the significant difference is that most other Zen forums have a big share of people who are pretty comfortable in their social identities as Zen practitioners, belonging to sanghas, going on retreats, having teachers. And for some reason this makes the discussion pretty nice and friendly. You could make a caricature of it, with people talking about how great the veggie food is at Great Dragon Moon River Monastery, and so on. 

Well, I’m kind of a nerd, and I’m interested in this kind of frustration, and I was thinking about how you could relate it to a concept of “crisis,” and maybe even make a whole economic metaphor about it, but I probably won’t get that far with this, so I’ll just write some “cursory remarks” and hope you see why I find it so interesting -- maybe someone can clarify my weird thoughts.

One approach is to compare Zen to some other topic of discussion, like bikes, microbrew beers, or working out. These other topics have a great deal of diversity, novelty, and tangible hooks to hang your discussion on. That’s why lunch break discussion tends to revolve around this kind of “hobby” stuff with lots of different names, nouns, news, opinions, and so on.

Well, I’ve had some lunch break discussions with Zen people, and it’s like with everything else. Nouns are usually pretty good to talk about. Like where’d you get your cushion. Did you like the biscuit we got on the fourth evening of sesshin? People also make for great topics. Do you know what Anna’s doing these days? Who else was there for zazen on Sunday? Did you know roshi used to be a florist? Future plans: so, when are you going to your next sesshin? And so on. Small talk. It can be very fun! And very dull…

I’ve tried to start some “small talk” threads on here, like “What’s up?” One of them was pretty nice. Had people talking pretty candidly about their lives. Some people were happy and satisfied, some people were kinda miserable. I really enjoyed it. We should have more of those, I think. Good for the sense of community, if that’s a desirable thing. But of course we can’t have a whole subreddit called Zen if it’s just small talk.

So one fun move here might be to put “small talk” on one end of a spectrum, and see what’s on the other end. Let’s say “big talk.” I think the most reasonable thing to put in that category is the kind of thing you’d talk to a therapist or priest about. Life Issues. Big Problems. The climate. Relationships. Career plans. What’s it all good for, anyway. I think I should get a divorce. The political party I’ve voted for for thirty years doesn’t really feel like it’s representing me anymore. Things like that. Not the usual lunch break stuff -- more like after a few beers stuff. The kind of stuff that people can really bond over, or really get upset about.

Now that we’ve got that spectrum set up, let’s think about the quintessential kind of Zen talk: the encounter between master and student, *dokusan*. In the tradition with which I practice, there’s very little explicit instruction about what’s “supposed” to happen in dokusan -- it’s up to you and the teacher. But the basic advice is to avoid both “small talk” and “big talk.” Neither is relevant here! There are other times for them. I guess you could say dokusan transcends them.

And for this reason, dokusan can be truly frustrating, difficult, painful. I think it’s one of the most interesting experiences I’ve had in Zen practice. I go in there, make a bow, sit down, and… Sometimes I just wish I had a tangible problem with my zazen or something. “My back really hurts, what should I do?” Or “I’m just feeling extremely sleepy, and I can never concentrate at all.” But usually I don’t. Then I just don’t know what to say. But I’m sitting there. It’s intense. What could I say? All sorts of doubts, emotions, weird stuff happens…

I could try to make some kind of joke, but of course this would just be a lame, stupid posture. I could try to say something that seems like something a good Zen student would say. Maybe something about something in nature. “The moon tonight is quite round.” Or “When I was walking in the forest, I saw a frog.” That might be pretty nice. But still, just a posture. I suppose it’s possible I could even pull off some kind of act. But then she’ll ask something, and the game will be up, and I will just feel like a biggest douchebag, a total failure, an extremely terrible Zen student, who can’t even be humble enough to just have some tangible zazen problem to ask about.

Anyway, I’m digressing into my own personal issues here, but my point is that dokusan is a really intense encounter, precisely because it excludes both “chit-chat” and “serious business,” and you are left to initiate something that you are held fully responsible for but that you don’t really understand.

The teacher will often ask something. “So, what is *mu*?” “Have you seen it yet?” Agh! Excruciating! I spend my days making up random bits of conversation about humdrum things, and sometimes indulging in drama and deep emotions -- but usually people don’t sit directly in front of me holding a staff, asking *WHO ARE YOU?*

And that brings me to the topic of “crisis.” Because that’s what these encounters seem to point to. My ordinary goods have no value anymore. I am insolvent. Personality, charisma, intelligence -- these things are just vapor now. I can’t even rely on humility, confusion, or sadness. Hell, I can’t even declare bankruptcy. All my words and ideas seem entirely beside the point, all my learning is good for nothing, even my precious meditation is worthless.

Some critics of capitalism talk about the concept of a “general crisis,” where the whole system and the ideology it’s founded upon are sort of revealed as ungrounded. And this general crisis goes pretty deep into the life of people in society. It casts a shadow on all kinds of relationships, practices, ideas, feelings, aspirations. It manifests in diverse ways, both reactionary and revolutionary. It can cause confusion, despair, alienation. But also exhilarating joy and liberation.

This kind of crisis is not something that necessarily happens intensely overnight. It’s something that usually exists as a shadow, sometimes very dimly felt, sometimes intensified.

The idea here, of course, is that Zen resembles some kind of crisis, and that it’s always present here as a kind of shadow, sometimes manifesting as frustration and even anger.

I think that’s all I’ll write for now. I hope you find something useful in this tedious chunk of text!",,False,,t5_2qhmf,False,,,True,t3_16vsva,http://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/16vsva/talking_about_zen_and_the_idea_of_crisis/,

I know you all talk about seem pretty deep stuff here (which I enjoy a lot) so this may seem trivial to some, but a few years ago I was given a miniature Zen Garden as a gift from a relative who has know passed away. I found quietly re-arranging it to be some of the most calming hours I have ever spent doing anything in my life, and found it a huge help when I was feeling bogged down with stress.  

During a house move some months ago it was accidentally damaged beyond repair and had to be thrown away. I have been looking into replacing it with another one but everything I can find online looks very very cheap and tacky and generally of a poor construction. I’m not just basing this on looks but also customer reviews.  

I can only think because what I’m looking for is “desk” sized (for want of a better term) that people do not expect high quality goods as there aren’t many people who want it for serious purposes when they are that size.  

If anyone could point me in the direction of somewhere where I can buy one or even cobble together my own from a collection of items designed for another purpose I would be very very grateful! Thank you for taking the time to look at my post and thank you in advance for any help you can give!  
*****
**TL;DR**
Please help me find a nice “desk top” sized Zen Garden to replace a lost one that is nice/of a high quality, thank you in advance of any help you can give.  

*****
**EDIT**  
Just to clarify, I'm getting a lot of great advice on building my own miniature Zen garden, but I'm afraid I dont have the tools/money/time to invest in building my own. I'm sure with practice/help I could do it and I'm sure it would be more personally rewarding than buying one, but I dont really have that option at the moment.  

I'm looking to either buy a ready made one or buy items that are meant for other purposes that I can re-use such as maybe a decorative plant pot or something to that effect. Thank you again everyone.

May be likened unto the blazing sun sitting high in his meridian tower.
Such a man would teach nothing but the dharma for realizing the essence of mind,
And his object in coming to this world would be to vanquish heretical sects.

We can hardly classify the dharmas into ""sudden"" and ""gradual""
But some men will attain enlightenment much quicker than others.
For example, this system for realizing the essence of mind
Is above the comprehension of the ignorant.

We may explain it in ten thousand ways,
But all those explanations may be traced back to one principle.
To illumine our gloomy tabernacle, which is stained by defilement,
We should constantly set up the light of wisdom.

Erroneous views keep us in defilement
While right views remove us from it,
But when we are in a position to discard both of them
We are then absolutely pure.

Bodhi is immanent in our essence of mind,
An attempt to look for it elsewhere is erroneous.
Within our impure mind the pure one is to be found,
And once our mind is set right, we are free from the three kinds of beclouding [hatred, lust, and illusion].

If we are treading the path of enlightenment
We need not be worried about stumbling blocks.
Provided we keep a constant eye on our own faults
We cannot go astray from the right path.

Since every species of life has its own way of salvation
They will not interfere with or be antagonistic to one another.
But if we leave our own path and seek some other way of salvation
We shall not find it,
And though we plod on till death overtakes us
We shall find only penitence in the end.

If you wish to find the true way
Right action will lead you to it directly;
But if you do not strive for buddhahood
You will grope in the dark and never find it.

He who treads the path in earnest
Sees not the mistakes of the world;
If we find fault with others
We ourselves are also in the wrong.

When other people are in the wrong, we should ignore it,
For it is wrong for us to find fault.
By getting rid of the habit of faultfinding
We cut off a source of defilement.

When neither hatred nor love disturbs our mind
Serenely we sleep.

Those who intend to be the teachers of others
Should themselves be skilled in the various expedients which lead others to enlightenment.
When the disciple is free from all doubts
It indicates that his essence of mind has been found.

The kingdom of buddha is in this world,
Within which enlightenment is to be sought.
To seek enlightenment by separating from this world
Is as absurd as to search for a rabbit's horn.

Right views are called transcendental;
Erroneous views are called worldly.
When all views, right or erroneous, are discarded
Then the essence of bodhi appears.

This stanza is for the Sudden school.
It is also called the Great Ship of Dharma [for sailing across the ocean of existence].

So, I appreciate any replies as it will help me with my journey.  Hopefully there are other folks here with similar questions. *=)*

*******

I'm somewhat familiar with the history of zen (it's migration from india to china, then to japan and korea, and most recently to the west), and with each step it takes on some of the culture that it comes into while still retaining some of the cultural references it already had.

I'm thinking of the rituals, chanting (in languages from previous 'steps' of its migration), religious symbols and even the dress of teachers.  I'm also thinking of certain parts of the buddhist belief system, like reincarnation and enlightenment.

*(I've even found myself looking for these types of things as an indication of authenticity of a teacher or group.)*

* 
How much are these things really a part of zen?   
* 
If you do remove all of these types of things, are you left with a 'philosophy' of sorts, and if so, how meaningful is that 'philosophy' really? (can you have zen without the rest of it and is it really zen?)
****
I've read some books on the subject but if you'd like to point to some books or sites that have helped you I'd appreciate that as well.

You know of children who grow up too soon or are neglected; these are like the fruit of a tree that is not nurtured. The children like that they are devoured totally and cast aside by the wind.

Those children who are raised correctly within the proper confines of a good, a just and noble society; these are the fruit that is planted correctly in the ground and these are able to grow into trees, tall and strong, with roots that are firmly planted to last for generations.

Looking at the TV, the movies and the media on the internet today I see that there are many trees that are not growing because of the noise... the corruption and the vileness in the world. The soil is dry, the wind fierce and the rain is sparse. There are no people to tend the soil and garden.

These may be illusions, but they are still existing to some extent in our world, causing our problems and folding beyond our causes of enlightenment, as if Siddhartha was left a street urchin beggar instead of a Brahmin's son; would he have been the same person?

I think that the fruit must be ripe before planting, but now then not too ripe either or it will be too far-gone. Western society seems to plant too early or too late now, or not at all.

Drugs and alcohol, excesses they come and spoil the crops sometimes to a very large extent, we lose out. Greed fouls the mix.

So does the wind and rain come then and blow gale the seeds not firmly planted in soil that is well tended. As a stone falling into a pond, the seeds planted well do grow the best.

So take your children into your protection and hold on to their place.

There's a whole lot of discussion about self and no-self and and the conceptualization of not conceptualizing and blah blah, but that all seems rather, well, self-interested, as far as I'm concerned. What about where the rubber meets the road - in human relationships? Sure, it can be beneficial to work on letting go of attachments and taking responsibility for our emotions, thoughts, and actions, and recognizing them to be what they are, but this only gets us so far. Sure, we can use an absolute point of view (or even a view that balances the absolute with the relative) to help mentally navigate certain situations, but if life experience is any indicator, we fundamentally live as human individuals acting with other individuals. Our actions and emotions affect other people's actions and emotions - and this warrants our attention and compassion. The question for me is: when do we untangle ourselves from others, and when do we engage? I'm sure some people's initial response will be to do X sometimes and do Y other times, or maybe to not worry about it because everything is happening spontaneously, or that to ascribe to any point of view is to live out of the mind, yadda yadda. But let's face it: we have minds, and the mind can be important tool towards living a happier and more fulfilling life, even if that life isn't strictly ""zen"".

Does zen guide your personal relationships, or is it the abandonment of zen that allows you you fully dive into your relationships? Or perhaps more precisely, zen doesn't guide anything, and it's the abandonment of the conceptualization of zen that allows us to dive into things fully..idk..any thoughts?",,False,,t5_2qhmf,False,,,True,t3_1ik9ml,http://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/1ik9ml/zen_and_interpersonal_relationships/,
