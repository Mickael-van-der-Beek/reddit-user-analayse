Based on our defense last year, your offensive line held up pretty damn well.

That being said, I love what Todd Haley is doing with your offense and it almost destroyed us. Keeping Manning off the field for 57 minutes was a good choice, but the result wasn't as good as it should've been (from your perspective). Getting rid of the constant vertical offense helps keep your defense strong and makes Ben a more accurate passer, but remember that it's new to the team so give it some time and you will have one of the best offenses in the league. Don't forget that you have Dwyer now, who is just damn impressive. Just wait on the return of Mendenhall and you're offense will be torturous for any defense. 

Obviously your defense is still one of the best defenses in the league, if not the best. All in all it was a really good game and very close. The first game is always hard, especially away from home. Look forward to seeing you guys in the playoffs!

I mentioned that I didn't have one due to lack of funds and that I would rather spend my money on my daughter. 

Well, a fellow redditor by the name of rydrid messaged me asking if I would like one. Skeptical, I sad yes. He asked if I would like him to buy the jersey or if I would take gift cards. I chose the latter due to the fact I can't handle pressure at a restaurant when the waiter comes, let alone pick a jersey and not want to go to high on the price.. Later on we exchanged information.

I came home from a long day of work to a package. [The package](http://imgur.com/a/oKBql) contained gift cards, some stickers for my daughter, an army shirt, an army water bottle and cozy. 

A couple days later (today), my James Harrison jersey has arrived!

I just wanted to wish everyone a great game for this upcoming bloodbath.  These are the moments we long for every season.  Week 1 is in the past and any Ravens fan who brings it up, trying to say that the Ravens are better than the Steelers is, quite frankly, an idiot and we're all better off ignoring them (Ravens fans too).  I know my attitude towards the Steelers are rather controversial amongst Ravens fans since I actually do really like the Steelers (as I previously mentioned [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/steelers/comments/kdaam/i_would_hate_to_have_to_deal_with_this_man_for/c2jdu5c?context=2)) and I'm happy to see that you guys have rebounded so well since the start of the season.

I would say this is *the* game for the division but, thanks to Cincinnati's good start to the season, I can't.  Still, you and I both know there is nothing else like it.  We're gonna see a lot of [this guy](http://i.imgur.com/BlyrJ.jpg), a lot of [this other guy](http://i.imgur.com/0Tlr8.jpg), [these two guys](http://i.imgur.com/Me65f.jpg), [these couple of guys](http://i.imgur.com/VjOFk.jpg), [this group of guys](http://i.imgur.com/LGjfK.jpg), [this one large guy](http://i.imgur.com/0y8kG.jpg), [this other large-but-nowhere-near-as-large guy](http://i.imgur.com/nOfd2.jpg), and, of course, [these two monsters](http://i.imgur.com/J6odR.jpg).  And, hopefully, we won't have to deal with any questionable moves by [these guys](http://i.imgur.com/REuRg.jpg).

So, there we are.  We've got a week.  It's gonna be a long week but, dammit, it's gonna be fun.  They almost always are.  So, r/steelers, here is to what I hope winds up being the best game of the regular season.  I'm fucking excited.  Let's do this.  [Cheers](http://i.imgur.com/ziPfy.jpg).

And I can't help but feel like the Football that we know is slipping out of our hands into this new-age idea where ""safety"" and ""morality"" trump the things that made the sport what it is. Football has never been a ""safe"" sport, and now they are trying to change that because of how much worth franchises are putting on their star players (offense in particular).

In my opinion, the Steelers have been the perfect embodiment of an NFL defense, very physical. James Harrison especially. Yet, most NFL ""fans"" refer to him as a ""dirty player"" and a ""scumbag."" This turns my stomach upside down. Harrison is the prototype of what a defensive player should be and I will forever remember him for the way he played the game. 

Seeing all these people post their outrageous opinions on the ""bounty-scandal"" just makes me think that they really have NO IDEA what football actually is (and this isn't coming from someone who is trying to back their team in the midst of a scandal, but someone who is legitimately scared with what might become of one of the things I cherish most in life). New-age fans can't seem to understand that a defensive strategy is to ""hurt"" any opposing offensive player any chance that they can get, not fucking ""injure"" them. Which is entirely different. Brother Harrison even said it himself in the midst of being fined for his ""dirty"" play a couple years back. He said, ""I don't want to injure any players. But, I want to hurt them."" ....And that ladies and gentlemen, is FOOTBALL. And in my mind that will ALWAYS be football. But the majority can not seem to accept that. I felt if anyone could relate to how I feel on this matter, it is you Pittsburgh.

Have a good season, and enjoy what seems to be a dying breed while it lasts. ",,False,self,t5_2r526,False,,,True,t3_11sfzd,http://www.reddit.com/r/steelers/comments/11sfzd/what_is_happening_to_football/,

Please continue to make a speedy recovery from your injuries, but don't once again pretend to be healthy only to place the rest of your season in jeopardy by coming out and playing a terrible game against the Ravens. While we realize our season possibly hinges on beating the Ravens and not dropping to 6-6, we also remember so fondly that Monday night last December in San Francisco, when you assured us all that you were good to go and would carry us to another AFC North crown. Unfortunately, your foot carried us to a disappointing result and a fateful day in Denver most of us would like to forget. So please, Ben, keep your newborn child, teammates, and loyal fan base in mind when lobbying to play this Sunday. We really want to win this game, but we also want you to be the MVP Ben we saw this year, not the beat up, can't move, repeatedly sacked and hobbled Ben. Thanks.  

Sincerely, 

A loyal Steelers fan

P.S. We also don’t want Brian Hoyer or Batch under center for the remaining four games, but what can you do?

How do you do it?,PenguinBallZ,62,13,89,http://www.reddit.com/r/steelers/comments/1f7wxv/steelers_fans_how_do_you_do_it/,"I recently I got out of the Wilson VS. Cam thread in /r/nfl and as a Seahawks fan I felt that people were very under appreciating what Wilson was able to do for our team, he always seems to be brushed to the side when talking about the best rookies/second year QBs and I ended up becoming one of THOSE Seahawk fans for a moment. I just want to know how you guys put up with Big Ben being undervalued when people talk about top 5 QBs in the NFL? There is a general concensus on who 4 of them are but that 5th spot is always debated. Some say Eli or Flacco but then others say they are too inconsistent. So other people say Matt Ryan but the answer too him is that he doesn't perform well in the playoffs.... So why not choose the guy who is both consistent AND is lights out in the playoffs?... Also people who say he is injury prone are insane. I just have to say that I love your fan base and you guys are a soft spoken bunch.

Edit: I am definitely going to take a page from your book and just let Wilson quietly beat down on defenses and win games like Big Ben does.

No it’s not the end in the world. No we’re not destined for a mediocre season or 8-8 or 5-11 as some of you are already predicting us for. Reading the comments in this forum these last few days has shown me there are a lot of overreactors out there. Here are some key points that need to be said:

**Why on earth would the Steelers pay Lewis starter money when it was not even a guarantee he would be starting next season?**

For everyone who thinks we should have “paid the man” need to realize it wasn’t even a sure thing Lewis would be our #2 guy next season. Of course if we paid him starter money our hand would have been forced to start him, however it still remains that Cortez Allen quietly had a VERY impressive season himself and would have battled Lewis in this year’s camp for that #2 spot. So what would happen if Allen established himself as the better corner?  Then all we would hear is how the Steelers overpaid for Lewis when they have better talent on the bench.

Now don’t get me wrong, in a perfect world we would have loved to keep both Lewis and Allen as Ike isn’t getting any younger and those two would be perfect #1 &amp; #2 guys. But when your hand is forced to make a decision, you have to make the correct one. And Colbert made the correct one in my mind by not overpaying for Lewis. We still have a strong starting squad for this upcoming season with open spots to draft and groom up and comers. That is how you rebuild while still remaining competitive.

**Speaking of overpaying, why would the Steelers throw money at Sanders when they don’t have to?**

This is just like the Wallace situation last year. Until someone actually gives Sanders an offer the Steelers’ do not have to throw any additional cash at Sanders. Sure the RFA tag is like walking on egg shells but we have the first right to match the offer and if Sanders is THAT important to the Steelers they can definitely find a way to match it. Like Colbert said last year, we hold the cards in this situation not anyone else, why overplay your hand when you don’t have to? Again that’s what silly teams do, not us…

If we lose Sanders, yes that will be a huge kick in the chops. I don't agree with the people who downplay him, he is hands down our best route runner and hands on the team. I was excited to see Brown in the X and him as our starting Flanker this season. But the Steelers are a better judge of talent than we are and have already done A LOT of scouting in the draft. If they feel he's replaceable, I can believe it too. But again, that's playing hypothetical as Sanders hasn't even been given an offer yet and the Steelers haven't refused the right to match it. We still have all the control at this point.

**The Steelers are fine guys relax!**

We still have Ben. We still have LeBeau and Butler.  We are still a top tier team in this league. I remember how horrible it was when the Steelers let Joey Porter walk, oh it was the end of the world to so many people, yet he was quickly replaced by an undrafted free agent who eventually became a defensive MVP. This is how the Steelers work, and will continue to. There is a reason we are the most successful franchise since the merger (in our opinion football didn’t exist pre-merger right?), because we know how to run things from the top down. Let the other teams make fools of themselves and overpay for overrated talent. When the draft comes around the real teams will show them how it’s done.

I'd also love to hear any additional feedback others have been hearing around camp as (like i mentioned above) I love reading this stuff...*

###Offensive Player Notables:

**Le'Veon Bell** - Is stealing the show so far. Most have him as a shoe in starter come week 1. They say what he's shown so far is all the grit and power that both Redman and Dwyer contain, but has the play making ability you want to see in a feature back. Especially since several sources have reported talks of more stretch plays in this year’s offense, right now Bell is showing everyone that he’s really the only true back who has the ability to get around the corners and have the strength to muscle his way through should he find a gap. Most have said Bell has as much buzz about his camp performance that Wallace had during his first year.



**Jonathan Dwyer** - Hearing mixed reviews of this guy. Most were in agreement that he showed up to OTA's a little hefty, but some have now given him credit of having a strong camp not only showing up in great shape but making several memorable plays thus far. I think the list of people having him as a cut candidate is growing smaller and smaller.



**Redman** - Redman is as consistent as they come and it’s pretty much business as usual in regards to what you'll get out of him in camp. He's now the vet of the group so he's pretty much setting the tone. Hasn't shown anything new so what you've seen is what you're getting.



**Will Johnson** - I've seen his name come up quite a bit on twitter and news articles. I have read he is one of the biggest standouts so far this camp. With David Johnson still limping around on the sidelines, Will Johnson is still playing his FB/TE hybrid position and not only laying some great blocks but making some pretty good catches as well.



**David Johnson / Heath Miller** - Both on the PUP, though ive read Heath looks more ready than David. I believe that's because Johnson underwent surgery recently which is why most reported him hobbling around at the start of camp. After the type of camp he put up last season it would be really nice to see him compete with Will.

**Antonio Brown** - Business as usual for Brown. Him and Ben have great chemistry amongst each other and have had several TD strikes in various drills. They've made mincemeat of younger CB's who are playing because our CB's are dropping like flies.



**Emmanuel Sanders** - Its been reported this guy has shown up to play. Running faster than most have seen him, everyone who's commented on him says he looks better than ever. Even on the punt catching drill Sanders set this year’s camp record by catching and holding onto 6 balls. I hear he tried for 7 sometime later but dropped one before getting close to it. It would be surprising to see him be our returner given our WR situation but he showed up today on the depth chart as the #1 guy.



**Markus Wheaton** - Is for the most part living upto the hype. I would say expectations but some felt he was a little overhyped coming into camp. Word is he’s looking pretty legit. As Tomlin would say ""so far it’s mostly football in shorts"", his hands and route running look solid and he's made quite a few plays out there to catch peoples attention. 

**Plaxico** - Actually looks pretty decent so far. Had a nice red zone catch and a few other leap frogs which is what we (and especially Ben) want to see from the big guy.



**Mike Adams** - Doesn't look like that stabbing affected him one bit. Gilbert kicked off camp at LT, but Adams has now been shifted to that position. Adams is still showing tremendous strength and has obliterated some LB's when given the opportunity to square off one on one. Even heard he served up some pancakes to Ziggy Hood.



**Maurkice Pouncey** - I've seen someone report he's upto 300lbs now but zero complaints out of this guy. He opened camp and said his peace about the hat situation, then went to work. Him and DeCastro have looked magical at times in the run game.



**Marcus Gilbert** - I read he welcomed 1st round LB Jones to the NFL by dominating him several times in head on drills, yet the whole move to RT concerns me. Some speculate he might be losing his starting job overall but I doubt it.



**Kelvin Beachum** - While everyone loved Legursky for his versatility, Beachum has definitely one upped him as a guy who could possibly fill in at all 3 positions on the OLINE. The coaching staff reportedly loves this guy and he's showing to be a valuable asset to an offensive line that has struggled with injuries.



**Ben Roethlisberger** - Looks red hot so far. Great shape, confident, nailing all his passes, just a dude his is prime right now.



###Other offensive tidbits:

David Paulson has looked good as a pass catcher so far, but has been brutalized when trying to block. Spaeth has looked poor in that department as well and that’s supposed to be his strong suit.



Wilson vs. Landry battle. Some sites are starting to speculate a QB battle brewing here but im not buying it. The credible sources are seeing both QB's as pretty inconsistent for the most part and the Steelers will stick with the draft pick over an obvious camp body.



Curtis McNeal - Remember the name, watch him during preseason. Everyone says hes a little fire cracker who loves to hit and always the first to volunteer especially when it comes to a physical drill. He's nicknamed 'Moody' because of his hard hitting attitude. *UPDATE* - McNeal was surprisingly cut today by the Steelers. Early rumors are its injury related.



Ramon Foster - Reported by Lolley has yet to be beaten 1on1 so far this camp. Most felt his spot was up for grabs but its not looking that way.



###Defensive Player Notables:

**Cornerbacks** - I guess we'll lump this into 1 group as we havent seen much. Most are hurt, Ike is still Ike and thats about it. Ben and company appear to be loving it as I hear passing has been easy when both sides do square up. The Lewis train (especially from the fans) are really tooting their horn right now, but that's always expected with hindsight. I still think we're fine and I still believe the Steelers made the right move there.



**NT** - This will be the second spot we lump together as well as it’s been equally as quiet. Have heard McLendon is upto par though a little banged up, Alameda started on the PUP but recently returned, and the name Loni Fangupo has appeared quite a bit as a beast of a NT with 'tree trunk like legs' who has impressed thus far. Can't wait to see him this weekend. 



**The Beard, Hood and Heyward** - While Mitchell won't come out and fully say it, he's hinted at a 3 man rotation here. We have 2 first rounders both doing exactly what’s expected and a seasoned vet who's always set the standard. You can pose the argument for any of the 3, it will be interesting to see what happens here. Hoke has been a big influence in camp and in his belief we have 3 LeBeau starters with only 2 positions to put them in.



**LaMarr Woodley** - While he hasn't put down the camera or still doesn't shy away from any chance to be in front of it, from what i've heard thus far is Woodley working 10x harder than he has in previous years and has been a dominating force in camp so far. Most have referred to the 'old Woodley being back'.



**Jarvis Jones** - Mixed reviews from him so far. A lot have hyped the ""J.J. Wyatt type play"" he made batting down a Roethlisberger pass, most have reported him getting handled easily on 1-on-1's against offensive lineman, some not even being the Steelers best, but more like 3rd and 4th stringers. Though it has been said that Jones is a student of the game and he’s playing it slow and learning LeBeau’s defense faster than others. He has been complimented on how quickly he implements feedback from his coaching staff which they love. I guess we'll wait and see what he puts on tape...



**Jason Worilds** - To Jones credit, Worilds hasn't stood out much as well. I read at one point Fans &amp; Team Favorite Joe Long whooped Worilds twice and Tomlin had to ask for a 3rd rep for him to ""reclaim his dignity"".

**Marshall McFadden** - Is a name I am hearing a lot. Attitude, nasty, and the play to back it up. Someone even referred to his demeanor as “Harrison Like”. Definitely a bubble player but from what the media has thrown out, most like what he's brought so far.



**Troy Polamalu** - Great feedback from Jim Wexell in regards to Polamalu dodging the media thus far this camp. Polamalu appears to be a man on a mission this year who completely changed not only his workout routine, but is not letting anyone bother him in route the career statement type of season.



**Shamarko Thomas** - Steelersdepot.com posted an article about Ike Taylors feedback on Thomas. If you haven’t seen it yet check it out, Taylor has a great attitude about him and its an awesome interview. The thing about Taylor is he's the most honest guy you'll ever meet next to Polamalu. Taylor informed the media that Thomas' nickname is 'headache' as his fellow teammates believe he will be giving several of those to various NFL players, including several for himself. It’s been reported he has a lot of learning to do and bites on plays too prematurely, he has said himself he has two of the best safeties in the NFL who are both providing him tremendous feedback.



###Other Defensive tidbits:

**Vince Williams** - a player to watch in preseason. Been shifted around a bit, upto 2nd team at one point. 

**Al Woods** - still not sure what to make of him. They slid him to NT, most likely because of the shortage at that spot but then threw him to DE at times. Hasn't had a standout moment yet but the coaching staff seems to like him.

**Chris Carter** - Name has not been talked about yet so far in camp but most of the time we hear it has been because of injury. No news might be good news, now we wait and see come scrimmage time. Same goes for Stevenson Sylvester, though for him it hasn’t been much of injury as it has been sub par productivity. Both guys need to step it up.",,False,self,t5_2r526,1375903916.0,,clark2,True,t3_1jvtyk,http://www.reddit.com/r/steelers/comments/1jvtyk/a_personal_review_of_media_intake_so_far_this_camp/,

Against the Browns, they kept us in the game after 8 turnovers.  Against the Ravens, with a back up QB in both games, they held Baltimore to 13 and 20 points.  Ben has thrown interceptions at crucial points in several games this season.  How many times has our offense given up a touchdown this season? Too many.  Our defense isn't the problem.  They play well without Harrison, Polamalu, Woodley, or Taylor.  They never let injuries excuse a poor performance.

Plus, this if my first post in this sub.  So...

Sometime in the fall of 2005, I was having breakfast, reading the Post-Gazette, at Pamela's in Shadyside on a Monday morning.  It was just a bit after 8am and the dining room was moderately full with the usual buzz and clinking of people sharing their conversations.  There was a slight lull in the overall noise, but I was reading and couldn't be bothered to look up.

My waitress came over with a coffee refill and my pancakes.  I folded away the paper to notice a new group of four that was sitting at the table next to mine.  There was no question, it was Hines Ward, Deshea Townsend and their significant others.  And the restaurant just went on after that little pause when they were recognized.

No drama.  No approaches to their table.  No kids asking for autographs.  There were glances over by everyone, but no riot or stupidity.  A restaurant full of Yinzers let two Steelers have a peaceful breakfast with their families the morning after a win.  After 86, 26 and their ladies were done, they paid their check, got up and limped out.  And not one person said a word, because that's how great Steeler fans are.  We recognize there is football time, autograph/personal appearance time, and family time.  Nobody wanted to disturb their family time.

The waitress did confirm she was well tipped.

TL;DR  I was in Pamela's when Hines Ward and Deshea Townsend had breakfast and nobody bothered them.",,False,self,t5_2r526,False,,,True,t3_19s4f4,http://www.reddit.com/r/steelers/comments/19s4f4/story_time_examples_proving_steeler_fans_are_the/,

Mooreman is a veteran but is at the tail of his career and doesn't compare to Kluwe in my opinion.

1366597886.0,34,self.steelers,1cu7zf,"The steelers have to draft the ""best leaders available"" not just the ""best players available"". My thoughts on the upcoming year.",tolas,39,5,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/steelers/comments/1cu7zf/the_steelers_have_to_draft_the_best_leaders/,"**Current Leaders.** The steelers have been perceived as a team that lacks leadership since Farrior, Ward, Aaron Smith, and others have left.  I think we'll continue to see Ryan Clark emerge as a leader.  Larry Foote is back to provide some ""old time"" continuity. We're starting to see Ben step up and really embrace the leadership role.  And I think Antonio Brown will do well growing into Hines Ward shoes.  

Even with these guys stepping up, it's clear we need to draft some quality players who are also quality people.  Ta'amu is a young guy who has had some trouble in the past.  The zero-tolerance they showed to Rainey makes it clear this team wants to get a better image and leadership in their young players.  I think the ""young money crew"" mentality is gone on the offense with the departure of Wallace.  Perhaps losing his friend Keenan Lewis on the defense prevented a similar attitude from developing there.

**Emerging leaders.**  It will be interesting to see how McLendon steps up as a starter.  He's a veteran player who is just now getting handing the starting role.  I've given up a bit on Hood as ever emerging as more than what he is.  He's a decent DE but probably not a star.  Cam Heyward however is my sleeper pick for most improved from both a player and leadership role this year.  If he get's handed a starting role I think he will be a star player in our defense for a long time.

**Time to step up!**  Timmons and/or Woodley.  If these two ever have ""career years"" at the same time, this defense is suddenly the feared powerhouse of the AFC north again.  Unfortunately we haven't seen that yet.  I think Timmons continues to grow and dominate games and Woodley will be a toss up.  He either shows up to play this year or he's gone.  The door is wide open for one of these guys to take on a leadership role.  We'll see if they step up. 


**On the losses this offseason.** Overall I think we're better off than most might realize.  It was time for a ""spring cleaning"" and the emergence of a new motivated young team to step up.  From that perspective I think this offseason was as good as it could have been.  I'm sure Harrison will dominate some games for the Bengals.  He'll probably have some great games against us.  But we HAVE to see if Worilds is the long term solution, and I'm personally excited to watch him. 


**Most pressing draft needs.**  We can instantly use a starting RB or WR.  We could actually start the season with who we have but the spots are there for a rookie to take.  OLB and ILB are huge needs of depth and potential future stars, but no matter who we pick I don't see them starting right now.  Your starting LB crew will be Worilds, Foote, Timmons, Woodley.  A young stud could take over Foote's job at some point in the year if we get lucky in the draft. In the defensive backfield we could use a young safety to fill in on spot duty and eventually take over for Clark or Polamalu, but again they wouldn't start this year unless there was an injury. 


There's my brain dump on the steelers upcoming year. I'm excited for the draft and to see a new young steelers team emerge this year.

Good luck against the Patriots or Jets. Show America what it's like playing AFC North football.",,False,self,t5_2r526,False,,,True,t3_f3eg8,http://www.reddit.com/r/steelers/comments/f3eg8/ravens_fan_here/,

___________________________________________________________
  
 EAST RUTHERFORD --- Eli Manning looked only at the ground as he walked slowly to the podium.  *How could this have happened?*.  Less than a week after Hurricane Sandy tore through the New York/New Jersey, the Pittsburgh Steelers tore the Giants a new coast line.  
  
""I don't understand this,"" a befuddled Manning spoke, ""how could they not let us win?""  Playing before an emotional crowd of 80,000, the New York Giants hoped to give residents of the devastated area something to cheer about--boy did they do the opposite.  
  
""What more could we have done?"" The quarterback said, ""I mean, did you see that fumble call?  I could have sworn they were just going to give it to us.""  

After jumping out to a 20-10 lead, the Giants seemed to run out of power after halftime. Even a valiant attempt at playing-dead by third year phenom Victor Cruz couldn't persuade the Steelers.  ""With the amount of ""Oooh!'s coming from the crowd,"" a distraught Eli sighed, ""I figured the game was in the bag.""   
  
Every thing was going smoothly for the Giants, until Mike Wallace broke off a game-changing 51-yard touchdown on a routine catch-and-run.  ""I said, 'Just step out of bounds, O.K.?',"" Giant CB Corey Webster added, ""But I guess he didn't hear me.""  
  
""Are you fucking kidding me?"" Steelers QB Ben Roethlisberger said, ""Why the fuck would we let them win?""  Boos rained down from the crowd as the final seconds ticked off the clock.  The fans seemed as stunned as their beloved quarterback.  ""With all the freakin' crap we been through 'dis week, ya think they woulda let us have it,"" N.Y. resident Vinny Baggadonuts said as he shook his head, ""I guess us New Yorker's are the only ones with class.""  
  
While not optimistic, news of an impending Nor'easter on Wednesday has Big Blue hopeful that a sympathy win against the Bengals is on the horizon.

Baltimore Ravens LB Terrell Suggs said he is not so convinced Pittsburgh Steelers QB Ben Roethlisberger (rib, shoulder) will not play in Week 11. The Steelers have already named QB Byron Leftwich the starter. ""Until the ball is snapped, I'm still preparing as if he's playing,"" Suggs said. ""I saw the guy play on a broken ankle when he came down here, and we even broke his nose, and the guy continued to play, and if you all recall, it didn't pan out too good for us at the end of that game. So like I said, until that ball is snapped when we're on the field and (the Ravens offense is) off the field, I'm not ruling him out. You can never question this guy's toughness. Guys like that are what this game is about.""

Lewis is going to command a big payday, ~$7MM a year or so, this while we have arguably the best nickelback in the league, fully capable of assuming a starting role opposite of Ike, guarding either the slot or Z receiver. 

Lewis isn't a #1 CB, and he doesn't deserve #1 CB $$$ that he is commanding. He didn't line up against the top X WRs last season, as Ike took on the tough assignments in every game that he was healthy.  He is a pretty good zone CB, but hes not in the same league as the elite cover corners out there. He isn't even the best CB on the team, as Ike takes that title. 

He likely leaves, and lands somewhere else that he is the #1 CB on the team, and leaves behind the best season of his career. Our defense remains an elite squad, Lewis, or no Lewis. Oh, and by the way, Cortez Allen is only a cap charge of $650M and $740M for '13 and '14.

**NEITHER OF THESE TEAMS LOSES TWO IN A ROW. THEY JUST DON'T.**

Just as last week's Packers game was a ""must-win"" for them vs the Bears, this is an even more important matchup for far more teams.

Let's look at a some of the past and projections for this matchup:

http://sportsdirect.usatoday.com/football/nfl-matchups.aspx?page=/data/NFL/matchups/g1_summary_15.html

The over looks pretty good, especially as Baltimore is now ripping people up on offense. I don't think anyone is underestimating what New England can do, even though they've been slow to start in 2012. This could very well end up being heavyweight slugfest. One thing I've noticed is that people are dropping New England's defense in fantasy quite a bit this week.

Recent meetings are pretty interesting. Since 2010, the Pats have taken 2 of 3 from the Ravens. Since '08, it's 2 of 5. Going back to '95, it's not great. Baltimore has only had 2 of the 10 meetings go their way. Baltimore is learning to hold their own as of late, but this is a lopsided arrangement in favour of the Pats.

When the Pats do lose 2 in a row, it's not all that bad. Last year we were a 12-4 playoff team and we beat them. The eventual Superbowl Champion Giants beat them in the regular season before besting them again for the Lombardi.

The last time the Pats lost 2 straight before that was...2009.

For Baltimore, going back to 2009, it was the only year they lost 2 in a row. They actually lost 3. Since then, there have not been back-to-back losses.

Keeping with 2009, the Pats are a 37-11 team since that season. The Ravens are 33-15. 

The ramifications for both teams are huge. Already the Pats are part of the 1-1 logjam that most of the NFL finds itself in with all teams of the AFC East being equal at .500 right now. The only bright spot is that Miami and the Jets are going to meet, leaving one of them behind and breaking up the logjam by at least 1 team. Buffalo faces a very poor Browns team. It's still possible that even with a Pats win, they could be tied at 2-1 with 2 other AFC East foes.

The Ravens don't have it much better. They're tied with the Bengals and with us at 1-1. We are fortunate to face a reeling Raiders team, which is direct pressure on Baltimore to keep pace. We'll have played our game right before the Ravens do, so they'll know if we've won or not. Cincinnati is on the road at Washington, a team devastated by defensive injuries. They are also suffering a coaching controversy on defense and in the locker room. The Ravens could find themselves on the outside looking in on a pair of playoff teams from 2011.

From our perspective, I'm not sure which win or loss benefit us because even with a Ravens win, we still control our destiny as there are two games to play with them yet to come. We don't play the Patriots this year, so asking the Ravens to help us could be sealing our own fate in tiebreakers for them. Going to Foxboro is never pleasant if you're the Steelers.

GOTY already? Who ya got? Who are you rooting for? As a side note, this is why I can't root against the Ravens - we just have to mind our own business and take care of our own games. This is still a ""whoever wins, we lose"" sort of thing.",,False,self,t5_2r526,False,,hypercyloids,True,t3_105nia,http://www.reddit.com/r/steelers/comments/105nia/new_england_at_baltimore_so_destructive_it_may/,

What ""team"" players are on now, really isn't that big a deal, They move them around, IIRC Emmanuel Sanders was Second team yesterday, because They were trying Wheaton at the ""Z"" reciever position (Cotch was in the slot, per reports)




Jarvis was with the third team yesterday, and apparently put on a ""clinic"" to end practice yesterday, according to Steelers writer Mark Kaboly.




In the span of 5 plays he did the following (last 5 plays of practice)



First-round pick Jarvis Jones has taken snaps mostly with the third team at right outside linebacker. After the show the rookie put on against the third-team offense at the end of practice Wednesday, it might be time for the Steelers to reward Jones with a promotion. Within a span of five plays, Jones plowed over would-be blocker David Gilreath; recognized a screen pass while rushing the quarterback, peeled off into the flat and knocked the ball away from Baron Batch; knocked the ball away from tight end Peter Tuitopou coming across the middle; and knocked down another pass in the middle of the field while playing zone.

While it was against the 3rd team, I think the importance of the post is that he apparently has the ability to read the offense and recognize plays, Even if he does need to put on a bit of weight.

I just want to see what your community has to say. Is he a one-trick pony? Prone to drops? Most importantly, is he worthy of the $10 million he is likely to command in free agency?

Thank you very much in advance. I have always respected your team's history and zealous fanbase.

**EDIT:** Thank you so much to everyone who responded. I really do appreciate all of your well-crafted and insightful answers. The gist of what I am getting is that his primary weapon is speed, and he also has immense talent. However, he is wildly inconsistent and has some major effort/selfishness problems.

Leftwich hasn't won a start since week 5 of the 2006 season.  Harrison is still 1 sack behind Porter for second most in franchise history.  The Steelers are the last AFC North team to beat the Ravens.  The teams are averaging the exact same amount of yards per game, with the Steelers having the having a seven and a half minute edge in average time of possession, and a 13.5% edge in third down conversion percent.  Lets go Steelers!

But did anybody notice how intricate our offense was? With all the complex/multiple motions before nearly every play, coupled with some of the unorthodox formations with the RBs, it seems as though many plays we ran had that ""gadgety"" feel to them. We kept the defense off guard and guessing with their assignments. And as for the passing plays, most of the routes were quick timing routes that will definitely get more effective as the season goes on. That was the biggest thing about Haley's new offense that stood out to me the other night; it was fairly effective considering the injuries and newness of the playbook, but it will be so much better with more practice. 

After Wallace gets acclimated and all the WRs get their timing down with Ben, I can see our offense scoring 28+ per game on average. Haley also showed not only a great commitment to the run all the way throughout the game, but he really tried to take advantage of our more skilled position players like Rainey (albeit I was scratching my head a few times when he asked Rainey to run up the gut) and Heath was greatly involved. I think the loss to Denver was due to rust and injuries, but if one side had to take the blame, the defense has to by default.

I think that most of us over at /r/giants have a healthy respect for your team and your organization as a whole. (despite the Hamburglar unis)

Anyways, I've only watched a few games of y'all this year, last week being one of them - thanks for crushing the division foe BTW.  I'm trying to get an idea of how this game is going to go for us, and as I haven't watched all your games this year, I was hoping you could provide me with a little scouting report for your Steelers. 

 I realize that your team is pretty injured just like we are.  What are the key spots where your injuries hurt you the most, and what should we expect to see from the replacements?  

In that same vein, I have a few overall questions about your perception of the matchup.

1.  What worries you most about your team right now?
2.  What worries you most about our team right now?
3.  What's the strongest aspect of your team at the moment?
4.  What matchups are you most looking forward to watching this weekend during the game?
5.  How do you see the Steelers winning this game?

1350329020.0,18,self.steelers,11iy6r,A statistical review of our season so far,Provider92,20,2,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/steelers/comments/11iy6r/a_statistical_review_of_our_season_so_far/,"A lot of the blame gets put on the defense for our record this year, but some people are jumping to the conclusion that our defense is weak and horrible.

According to [ESPN](http://espn.go.com/nfl/statistics/team/_/stat/total/sort/netTotalYards/position/defense), we are 3rd in the NFL for yards given up, 5th in yards per game, 3rd in passing yards, 6th in rushing yards, and have a +2 turnover differential. These are not the statistics of a bad defense.

Meanwhile, our offense is the worst in the league for rushing yards, while being 24th in yards in general.

Looking through these stats, our defense should be leading us to victory, yet every game seems to come down to the wire while opposing offenses keep up with our own. What's going wrong then?

In my opinion, it's the combination of the anemic rushing attack [penalty yards](http://www.teamrankings.com/nfl/stat/penalty-yards-per-game). We are *dead last* in penalty yards, averaging **79.2** yards per game. That's almost as high as the Raiders' average from last year. This is unacceptable, and is killing our team. Offensive drives repeatedly get stalled by penalties that break our momentum, and defensive penalties continue to give opposing offenses chances that they shouldn't have (looking at you, Ike).

We *are* a good team, and we still have a shot this year, but our players need to play smarter and we need to run a more effective offense.

**EDIT**: I understand that the stats don't paint the whole picture. That's why I classified *in the title* that it was a statistical review. Stats never show the whole story, but they definitely impact how the team can be viewed.

Yes, we are missing key players and key plays that may very well have saved more than one of these games, but you can't just dismiss being the most penalized team in the league and the worst rushing game, nor can you ignore a defense that can hold very well for the majority of the game. Defense definitely needs to step up, but the offense needs to just as much. And ffs, the penalties **need** to be toned down.",,False,self,t5_2r526,1350364359.0,,keisel2,True,t3_11iy6r,http://www.reddit.com/r/steelers/comments/11iy6r/a_statistical_review_of_our_season_so_far/,
