**THIS PAGE IS: on stand by more to come later!!** (This is how im going to indicate things are being updated..) 

----------------------

*This just in...*

* **[What was I Sahin?](http://i.imgur.com/mlD26.jpg)**

Sadly after months of failing to break into the first team Nuri Sahin, arguably one of the best specialist midfielders in the world 
[has left Liverpool for a return to Dortmund](http://i.imgur.com/Jwm2y.gif)

After battling Arsenal for his signature and only playing a handful of games many fans were left wondering why we bothered to take him loan him in the first place

* **Forren on the verge of sig..No? who?..Southampton!? seriously, who writes this thing..**

With a name straight out of Lord of the Rings and a hair cut to match, a lot of excitement was generated when reports revealed that the [up and coming Norwegian footballer was to have a trial at LFC.](http://i.imgur.com/4paoa.gif)

Reports have come out since then that suggest he has canceled the trial and has signed for Southampton.. [but we aint mad, right?](http://i.imgur.com/0gONc.gif)

* **[Sneijder shows Dutch Courage](http://i.imgur.com/w5Usw.jpg)**

This weeks wild card is world class midfielder Sneijder.. ^^not ^^like ^^we ^^already ^^had ^^a ^^much ^^cheaper, ^^younger ^^one ^^in ^^Sahin ^^but ^^not ^^petty 
^^even ^^though ^^its ^^a ^^fucking ^^joke.. the dutch maestro has publicly said he wants out of Inter and he's available for only 9m! 

*'9m for a world class player!? are you sure ElevenReds?'* Yes, I'm sure bitch!

but he comes with a catch.. [a MASSIVE £200,000 a week in wages](http://i.imgur.com/cFUQU.gif)

With Allen and Jonjo failing to find form and Suso too young to be counted on [we may have no choice but to pay up..](http://i.imgur.com/zKBKH.gif)

BR has admitted that Liverpool's spending policy in recent years when its come to wages ['could have been better handled'](http://i.imgur.com/7uaxn.gif)

* **[Cole does best and heads West](http://i.imgur.com/6Gi2O.jpg)**

After months of protesting in the middle east, the bankruptcy of Greece and the declining Ozone layer Joe Cole finally took responsibility for his actions and [left LFC
once and for all!](http://i.imgur.com/qkfZa.gif)

However, in the midst of celebrations it was revealed that Liverpool couldn't negotiate their way out of paying all of his ridiculous wages and [Joe Coles Agent was less than enthusiastic about lowering his clients wages](http://i.imgur.com/KmSKh.gif)

* **Time To Try, Tom**

2 weeks in and we're still after a player that many considered to be a done deal..at first what seemed to be a decided 4m deal has risen to to a reported 6m, whats worse is that is expected to rise if Liverpool cant manage to snap him up in this window.

Fans are divided, at 4m and his current ability he could go on to become a good player or we could wait and watch him end up else where [but a choice needs to be made soon.](http://i.imgur.com/U2v0g.gif)

* **..and he lived happily ever Afra**

Newcastle's Ben Afra has been linked with Liverpool after publicly saying he wishes to leave. After an outstanding season last year Newcastle have failed to regain their incredible form and the sale of their key players have seen them fall down to a place [that only the Hubble telescope can see them](http://i.imgur.com/Mb0O4.gif). 

* **[Move your Assaidi](http://i.imgur.com/hQZbR.jpg)**

A lot of talk has emerged of Liverpool's mysterious player Known as Assaidi heading on loan to Ajax or Galatasaray. The player who has had very limited playing time in his 6 months here, but he has largely impressed and [some fans cant work out why BR is reluctant to play him..](http://i.imgur.com/SEpCU.gif)

As of right now Assaidi is at the ACoN with Morocco 


--------------------------

*In Other News..*

-------------------------


* **[Gerrard is not down with the kids](http://i.imgur.com/Mqbm9.jpg)**

There was wide debate that Gerrards performance in recent years has been declining with age, despite his lack of goals this season which we've relied on in other years 
he's been storming the [assist table with 8 placing him top](http://i.imgur.com/wqrmq.gif).

In an Interview Gerrard was asked how he felt about playing in such a young squad to which he responded
that he didn't think playing a young squad would get results. 

* **Sturridge 2 for 2 on debuts**

Well, fuck me.. [He did it!](http://i.imgur.com/1RPcr.gif)

The first time since Suarez has a player we've bought has lived up to early to the hype and in some spectacular fashion! 2 goals in 2 first appearances from Sturridge
has fans foaming at the mouth over his potential. Still early days but thanks to [Chelsea's tight spending policy](http://i.imgur.com/bo8D1.gif) LFC were able
to bring in this highly rated undervalued striker in for just 12m!

* **[Suarez Hands us a win](http://i.imgur.com/BZ382.jpg)**

Suarez was again making headlines but for all the wrong reasons after he was seen handling the ball before he scored against Mansfield [sending us through to the next
round despite angry calls for a replay](http://i.imgur.com/DAdu2.gif).

While rival fans maintain the argument their teams consist of saints that would have admitted to the offence, a number of high profile players have come out
to defend Suarez. [Nobody could argue with his explanation of the situation..](http://i.imgur.com/ah0qW.gif) 

* **Sing your Carrolls, you need a miracle**

Andy Carroll when asked what team he'll be playing for next summer replied 'Liverpool'...[yep](http://i.imgur.com/pKnRM.gif)

* **Grab Your Coat Suso, You've Pulled..** 

In the last week 3 LFC players have threatend to deactivate their twitter accounts (Enrique, Jonjo and Suso) with 2 (Jonjo and Suso) actually going through with it due 
to harassment online.

Some have said they are just overreacting and should ignore them, however I personally think they should have looked to me as an Example of 
[how to handle situations like these](http://i.imgur.com/SDbIY.gif)

Had they seen him play for City, Bolton or Chelsea they would have never made such stupid points but that is the hivemind of /r/Soccer. 


Read this thread and now have a chuckle at the expense of these 'experts' who thought the price was due to him being English. 

http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/15atk4/daniel_sturridge_to_have_medical_at_liverpool_on/

I kept arguing on every Sturridge thread backing Liverpool on the great signing they had made, the only group of people who agreed with me were you lot and Chelsea fans when I came here to reassure you on a match thread that you had made the right call.

People kept calling him ""selfish"", ""wasteful"" only hyped up due to being English. I even made this comment on /r/Soccer 

http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/15atk4/daniel_sturridge_to_have_medical_at_liverpool_on/c7ky7it


&gt; ""The same people will be coming back to this thread and admitting they were wrong come Summer. Then they themselves will act all high and mighty claiming they always believed in him. 12m for him is a bargain.""

And how right I was. If you open this latest thread about Sturridge 

http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1e6r63/daniel_sturridge_has_now_scored_more_goals_in_his/

It now has comments saying ""Sturridge for England."" and of course you can see where this is going.

______

So congratulations Liverpool on acquiring such a great talent. The best is still yet to come from him. You will indeed have the last laugh. Hopefully see you back in the champions league at the expense of the other two fuckers from London soon.

Thought it would be a good idea to make a self-post so people could get a good idea of what he's like instead of me individually going through each different thread and explaining him to people. Hope you like it!**
______________________________________________________________________________________________

Liverpool is my second favorite club at the end of the day behind Atletico Madrid, and I can tell you all one thing for sure, Diego Costa at the moment is turning into one of the most deadly strikers in Europe.

During the start of the 2011/12 season, I would probably agree with a lot of you saying he's just alright and wouldn't probably ever cut it in the PL. But under Simeones' tenure, Costa has been transformed into the striker majority of Atletico fans wanted him to be when we bought him from Vallaloid in 2010. After a very successful loan spell with Rayo Vallecano in the 2011/12 season where he scored 10 goals and gave 4 assists in only 16 matches, Simeone knew at the very start of his time at Atleti that this young Brazilian was going to have a shout in his team.

Very technical, good on the dribble, wonderful pace, good strength, and having quite the eye for goal made Costa our first choice striker for the better half of the 12/13 season when Falcaos' form started to dip combined with a few injuries keeping him out of the first team. Costa can play on the wings quite proficiently, slowly but surely though he has made that CF position all his own. He was an integral part of our Copa Del Ray win this year over Real Madrid, notching 7 goals and 2 assists en route to the final as well as scoring in the final itself. Overall throughout the season, in which he was only a starter for the second half, he scored 20 goals and gave 15 assists.

Diego Costa only received this reputation of being a ""hot head"" in the last year. He has been very misunderstood, and the hivemind in /r/soccer just kind of took off after the first RM v Atleti derby match of the 12/13 season when Costa was locking horns with Ramos all game. People can say what they will about him, but Costa is a very self aware professional and came out in an interview earlier this year saying that he is a ""provocateur"" and that is how Diego Simeone wanted him to play. Drawing the fouls, getting the opposition all riled up so that they would be more prone to make mistakes. He's quite the intelligent footballer for only being 24 years old.

[Here's](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvll_n4wWDs) a video of his exploits from this last season. And [another](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCXIIfpjTK4&amp;feature=youtu.be). To me, he would be quite the pick up for Pool. As well, depending on how he does this season, he might be more realistic of a target for Pool in the January window, or even next summer. From what I've seen so far in our three friendly matches this summer, Costa isn't looking a shadow of his former self, he's looking twice the player he was last season and all of us at Atletico have very high hopes for him. He was by far the best player this season for Atletico Madrid, sure maybe didn't score as many goals as Falcao, but he did a lot more for the team in addition to 20 goals and 15 assists he gave this season.

**TL;DR He's definitely misunderstood, and a bit of a diamond in the rough. Would be a fantastic addition to Liverpool's top 4 ambitions as he has all the makings of a top class striker/winger in years to come.**",,False,self,t5_2qn0o,1375390531.0,,,True,t3_1jipmy,http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/1jipmy/some_insight_into_diego_costa_from_someone_who/,

Holy Fuck, what a walk. Regardless, I arrived and saw kids standing on a trash can to see, just as I had imagined. I walked around to the entrance/exit and there were only about 5-6 other people waiting there, trying to get the players autographs. All older scouse men who looked as if they made a living off of getting liverpool and everton players' signatures on merchandise and re-selling. Anyways, i got incredibly lucky and arrived right when the players began driving out. I also chatted with some local lads who were about my age (I'm 20) about all the transfer rumors and whatnot. The scouse accent is a bitch to understand! I am going to list the players and whether they stopped and their attitude/who they were riding with (if anyone). It will also be in the order they left (as well as my memory can serve)

1) **Martin Kelly**- He stopped to sign. Rather quiet though, didnt seem into it. Had his hair into a ponytail a la Andy Carroll haha

2)**Daniel Agger**- He stopped to sign. Saw his YNWA tattoo up close. Seemed a nice guy.

3)**Stuart Downing**- He stopped to sign. Didnt seem too into it though.

4)**Ryan Mclaughlin**- LOL none of the other scouse guys knew who he was but i recognized him and got his autograph. Was rather pleased with myself.

5)**Steven Gerrard**- Didnt stop. The security guy told me he rarely does. Somewhat downtrodden to hear this.

6)**Brad Jones**- Didnt stop. Nothing else to say haha.

7)**Jose Enrique**- Surprisingly didnt stop.

8)**Hendo**- Stopped and was one of the nicest lads. 

9)**Glen Johnson**- Stopped but looked fucking pissed. Was told that he rarely stops.

10)**Adam Morgan and Craig Roddan**- were together but didnt stop because no one but me recognized them haha

11)**Jon Flanagan and Jack Robinson**- were together(of course haha) and were glad to be stopped. talked to both about their various england exploits this summer.

12)**Simon Mignolet, Iago Aspas, Luis Alberto and Dani Pacheco**- Haha this was the funniest one. Migs was driving the spaniards. Everyone was getting the new boys autograph and no one was paying any attention to dani pacheco so i spoke with him a bit in spanish and got his autograph. Funny story on Aspas as well- one of the old scouse men didnt recognize him and asked if he was a player! Haha Iago just stared at him blankly. 

13) **Spearing**- Didnt stop. Think i saw his gps in the car set for blackburn? 

14)**Raheem Sterling**- wouldnt have stopped but for a crazy lady jumping in front of his car

15) **Coutinho**- literally the nicest one. I spoke spanish to him and he understood somewhat. Very personable; got the sense he would have waited even if 100 people were lined up outside his car.

16) **Skrtel**- Stopped but literally didnt say a word, even when i said thanks.

17) **Lucas**- Surprisingly didnt stop. I think it was because we were gathered around another players car and he saw the opportunity to go unnoticed haha.

18)**Wisdom**- Didnt stop; was somehow driving a porsche? Can't imagine his wages are that high.

19)**Joe Allen**- Another one of the really nice ones. Stopped and chatted about his recovery from shoulder surgery.

20)**Kolo**- Was being driven, I assume because he doesnt know the city very well yet. Obviously very very personable and friendly. I liked him a lot.

21) **Borini**- stopped and was very nice. A bit quiet though.

22)**Brendan**- What a lad. Stopped and chatted. I asked about suarez and he said ""we'll see"". Also asked about eriksen/alderweireld and got the same answer. Also, his hairline looks a lot better in real life and he seemed somewhat tan as well. 

**Players Missing**: Suso, Reina, Sturridge, Coates, Suarez. A few of the u18 lads had their moms pick them up ahahaha. They looked so embarrassed in front of their teammates.

http://imgur.com/a/8nyHF#9  (Sun in my face during both pics D:)

Only got pictures with bendan and hendo as my phone was dying and i needed it to navigate my way back to my hotel! Also got a few pics of the liver bird and the docks.

Tomorrow (well today) is my anfield tour. Off to bed now.

Let's all chill out for a minute here...,Mozza215,186,33,125,http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/1ctpyo/okay_lets_all_chill_out_for_a_minute_here/,"It's been a strange day. Rafa returned to Anfield, we sucked (suck?) at defending set pieces and conceded a goal, Luis supplied a sublime assist to Dan for our equaliser, Luis thought he was playing Ghana again and conceded a penalty and Reina didn't do his homework and went the wrong way for the penalty. But thankfully Luis was there (as he always is) to salvage a point for us in the dying seconds of the match. And oh yeah! Luis bit Ivanovic.

I know this is a huge deal. It's inexcusable and as much as I love the guy I hope Suarez gets a lengthy ban (if not from the FA then the club). It pissed me off big time when I saw it; we all thought he'd turned a corner after BR spoke to him earlier in the season. But he's obviously still our little controversial Uruguayan.

Now, I know that what he did was way worse that wrong, but can we all just take a chill pill? I've seen people commenting saying ""Luis can't stay after this! He's got to go!"" or ""He's ruining our reputation, surely this is his last game in a red shirt""

No.

Suarez isn't going anywhere; nor should you want him to. He's our best player. Our reputation would be in tatters without him, it's not in tatters with him. He goes out every damn game and shows how much Liverpool Football Club means to him, and he's clearly happy to be here. He may get over-excited at times. He may let the red mist descend when things don't go his/our way. He may be an idiot.

But you know what? Without his work rate this season we'd be in the bottom half of the table (probably not far off the relegation battle) and Rodgers might not even still be around. I don't care if every couple of months he gets the club into an utter shitstorm of controversy, because we owe a hell of a lot to him.

He might be an idiot at times, but goddammit guys he's our idiot, and I couldn't bear to see him play anywhere else.",,False,self,t5_2qn0o,False,,lfcflame,True,t3_1ctpyo,http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/1ctpyo/okay_lets_all_chill_out_for_a_minute_here/,

--------------------------------------------------

**Mock the week** 

* Liverpool have certianly [been busy this window!](http://i.imgur.com/w0qTK.gif) Luis Alberto, Kolo Toure, Iago Aspad and Simon Mignolet have all joined in attempt to boost our top 4 chances. 

* Liverpool owners earlier this week came out and made it very clear that suarez is not for sale. On his twitter account John Henry famously tweeted ''*what are they smoking over there at the Emirates?*'' much to the amusement of the footballing world, but some argue that [his other tweet that was quickly deleted and sent directly to Arsene Wenger was much more appropriate regarding the current situation..](http://i.imgur.com/Q76MFLq.gif)

* In their desperation, Arsenal made a club record bid of £40m and 1 pound in what they thought would trigger Suarez exit clause...[however it was not only the wrong fee humiliating Arsenal](http://i.imgur.com/7cwFzwJ.gif) but it also means no futher bids from arsenal are welcome and liverpool [now hold all the cards](http://i.imgur.com/36HTEnu.gif)

* It's also worth noting that not only have Arsenal failed to capture Suarez but [any of their transfer targets this window..were not bitter about it though](http://i.imgur.com/4V3sysu.gif)

* This week Reina secured a loan move to Napoli. While there were mixed feelings between liverpool and Reina, most fans are happy to see Reina [go off to be with our Rafa once again](http://i.imgur.com/WULpUP6.gif)

* Many fans were questioning whether or not BR's young player policy could actually work and provide results so during the pre season all eyes were on Coutinho, Sterling and Ibe..[I guess you can say some fans are now *kinda* optimistic about what they're capable of](http://i.imgur.com/26zz74a.gif)

* Despite his age, wonder boy coutinho who continued his oustanding form on tour, insists that despite individual praise [he can handle the pressure and he's here to help the team anyway he can](http://i.imgur.com/DnYiDJ2.gif)

* Kolo Toure made a fine start to his liverpool career helping us not concede a single goal during our preseason friendlies, while most believe his experience is invaluable others believe [that his best days are behind him and that older players should give way to young up and comers](http://i.imgur.com/12GEBtb.gif)

* Just as liverpool secured the signing of Luis Alberto, Everton managed to secure a season long loan for Gerard Deulofeu, both former barca wonderkids. However, while Everton have to send theirs back, [we get to keep ours](http://i.imgur.com/ErntEPo.gif)

----------------------

**The Rumour Mill:**

* Liverpool are reported to have lined up a deal to bring Left back Lorenzo Melgarejo over from Benfica on loan. The 22 year old would certainly fit our transfer criteria and as we only have 1 injury prone/reliable left back, [we really need another decent one](http://i.imgur.com/4mjneym.gif)

* Even though we've been linked more times than a switch board, Christian Eriksen is still rumoured with a move to Liverpool. Former LFC player Ryan Babel and current Ajax teammate tweeted that he had been *educating Eriksen about Liverpool*.. [Lets just hope he persuasade him](http://i.imgur.com/mHJEGil.gif)

* ...oh and despite all hope being lost earlier in the window, things have changed and were now back in the chase to sign either [Papadopoulos or Alderweireld](http://i.imgur.com/JmMn7oj.gif?1)

* This week's wildcard has the same likelihood of happening as us getting bought out by north korea, Torres once again is apparently on our radar looking to seal a £20m switch back from chelsea. I think the majority of Liverpool fans can agree [they have finally moved on](http://i.imgur.com/j1NxmyP.gif)

--------------------------

If you have a hunch or an argument you want to settle make sure you check out /r/CharitableBets .. I have a feeling that coutinho is going to score more than Gerrard this season ;)

Remember, this sort of thing happens *all* the time, in so many other football clubs.

It was funny when Persie did it to arsenal, or when Rooney had Manure by the balls. Who's laughing now? Now you guys are whining more than Suarez himself.

**CALM DOWN**

But really we have nothing to fear. If we sell, we get a chunk of change. We have rebuilt our depth, now we can stay afloat in the top 10 without Suarez. Sell Suarez, and we can make a lesser marquee signing,  perhaps.

Suarez isn't the type of guy that goes on strike. He loves playing way too much. And besides, if he's not himself that particular game, he still somehow manages to put in at least 99%, which is still higher than most players on the pitch.

I've seen so many level-headed fans here who completely loses it when Suarez opens his mouth. It's his personality, dude. I didn't buy a Suarez shirt for his mouth and ambition, I bought it for his talent and genius.

So please. When he speaks, just roll your eyes and carry on.

---

Guys I'm not telling you how to feel. I'm saying: Don't start a witch hunt. The way you guys react is much more emotional and angry than it is supposed to be. Suarez is an ass. I know. Deal with it. You knew this when we bought him, you knew this already. Say you want him out, but don't demonize the shit out of him, especially when he cared enough to carry the team. The guy has said nothing but good things about Liverpool, and it's fans, but he wants out. WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH WANTING TO MOVE AWAY, WHEN SUAREZ HAS BEEN HERE A GOOD 3 YEARS WITHOUT CHAMPIONS LEAGUE? I don't find anything he is saying disrespectful. You guys are blowing this completely out of proportion. I think the fact that he's saying he wants to play elsewhere while *not* turning in a transfer request, means that he's open for a move but he'll stay if he has to. Remember, other clubs have to match the release clause, or give us a really sweet deal for him to move. 40 million pounds is a lot of fucking money. We can get a young player with tons of talent, and basically turn him into yet another superstar striker. We've done it before, twice.

PS: Yes, I also think Suarez is a cunt. But eh, what am *I* to do about it? If he stays, I'm still gonna cheer all his goals.",,False,self,t5_2qn0o,1373840269.0,,lfc99,True,t3_1i9w0x,http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/1i9w0x/keep_your_head_mates/,

There is going to be a lot of talk going on about this club. LFC is linked with more players and stories during the transfer windows and off season than ANY other team for the past 3 years straight. There will be talk about Suarez, Skrtel, probably Rodgers, probably Eriksen, probably Ronaldo, Messi - you get the idea.

We all get the idea. Most of you know how it works around here, but some might not.

First off: anything LFC related posted here from The S*n or DailyMail will be napalmed working about 12 seconds. Trust me, you don't wanna be that guy.

Second: CHECK YOUR SOURCES. Jay78LFC on Twitter is not a ""source"". A source is directly from the mouth of a person and is properly referenced/cited within the article.

For example: CaughtOffside released HUNDREDS of transfer rumors this past January - of which literally NONE of them were true/accurate. None of their material was sourced.

Press loves the press. See the same story twice? Check the sources - chances are UNLESS they're from the BBC, Guardian etc it's very likely that one article has simply sourced the OTHER article, in which there are no real sources at all.

On that note,
Third: check this Subreddit! Because the same material can come from a number of news sources, check to make sure you're not flooding the feed with repeated stories. If your article offers new material not included in the former, post it in the comment thread on the original post.

Fourth: The Daily Speculation thread.

You've probably seen these. A lot of people around here have done GREAT work recently organizing a daily post to include any and all news/rumor/transfer related material into one convenient post where it can all be seen and discussed.

Please feel free to include anything I may have forgotten or if there's something else you can think of to keep the peace.

Reminder: this is a self-post, I get absolutely zero karma, just peace of mind. Please upvote for visibility.

[**They dont think it be like it is but they do...ughh...speculate anyone?**]
(http://i.imgur.com/3yWkU.gif)

-----------------

*The word on the street*,

-------------

* **[My, O' My, Galatasaray](http://i.imgur.com/SJHJmXd.jpg)**

[So we didn't get him..](http://i.imgur.com/8zr5cn9.gif)

Despite all the speculation and Gerrard saying publicly he'd like him at Liverpool the hunt for Sneijder is over.

Sneidjers reason for choosing Galatasaray over us was that he wanted to compete for trophies (although we all know that Gal were willing to pay him more) LFC fans weren't too upset but it's widely agreed that Sneijder could have [worded his explanation better..](http://i.imgur.com/xDXBl.jpg)

* **[BR to buy Brazilian Boy from Italians because of his ball control](http://i.imgur.com/Cnx6mWg.jpg)**

Philippe Coutinho, the 20 year old Brazilian wonder boy is [reported to be on the verge of joining LFC from Inter.](http://i.imgur.com/uLj0u.gif)

Tipped to be a great future prospect, no one is surprised BR is keen to land the player keeping up with his buy young, buy cheap, buy for tomorrow policy, however Inter arnt willing to let their potential future star go so quickly and BR was said to be a little frustrated over the amount of time Coutinho asked for [so he 'could think about it'](http://i.imgur.com/QyazU.gif)

If this rumor turns out to be true and with new arrival Sturridge in beast mode, [everyone will no doubt be very impressed with BR.](http://i.imgur.com/bhNML.gif)

* **There's no place like Loan**

[...Offers have been made for Coates](http://i.imgur.com/dtPn9.gif)

Dont worry its only on loan! In a recent interview Coates said he's feeling frustrated at a lack of chances in the first team and a loan to Wigan could end up being a win - win as it'll give him the playing time and development he wants while we can continue to play our strongest team.

* **You may take our Lives, but you'll never take our FREEDOM!.. Oh but you can have Wilson**

Scottish Youngster Danny Wilson has also gone on loan, this time up north to Hearts. Although a lot of people believe this to be just an experience building loan a lot more speculate this could be the end of Wilson who [has failed to live up to expectations and break into the first team, time will tell](http://i.imgur.com/mhyqw.gif)

* **Tom Ince to stay Black^^pool**

The once sought after Blackpool players is quickly falling our of favor, as Blackpool continue to [hold out for a higher bid of 8-9m](http://i.imgur.com/XAXoe.gif) and our front 3 showing that they can work together the deal that some LFC fans were once begging for may all but be over. 

* **Long to Reina over us**

So this just in, Reina father has come out and said that his son would best be suited at Barcelona. 

Barcelona...yeaah, no.

* **Xabi to be back**

[Negotiations between Alonso and Madrid continue..](http://i.imgur.com/HHbfD.gif)

---------------------------

*In the News this week,*

--------------------------

* [**Gerrard gets praised at writers award**](http://assets2.lfcimages.com/uploads/_jm_1523.jpg)

Deservedly so and long over due Gerrard received an award from the Football writers association for his contributions to football. Among the praise and the question about his long storied career one writer how does he feel the Champions league football compares to the Europa league [to which Gerrard responded..](http://i.imgur.com/jTu2h.gif)

* **Fabio is fabiolous**

Fabio Borini this week stated that despite his injury his Liverpool Career starts now. The 21 year old Italian was BR first buy at LFC but was quickly out of action after breaking his foot on international duty, leaving a lot of fans with the feeling our new young star was [going to be another Liverpool flop](http://i.imgur.com/8knWs.gif)

Thankfully Luis Suarez stepped his game and didn't get injured and in his most recent game, Fabio proved he was back and came painfully close to scoring, [he's back dear friends, he's back.](http://i.imgur.com/fPihK.gif)

* **Norwich to press abuse charges against Liverpool**

[Liverpool smashed Norwich 5-0...](http://i.imgur.com/8zFXS.gif)

while Suarez did what he does best and ripped the defense to pieces it was the work of Sturridge that surprised everyone. The new arrival scored and is now on 3 goal in 3 appearances for the reds and a lot of the doubters that were worried that Daniel wasn't the player we needed now consider him to be [the perfect accomplice to our current gunslinger Suarez](http://i.imgur.com/UoNKn.gif) 

* **Hendo goal the best thing since Borini's pizza**

Henderson form recently has been phenomenal! His volly against Norwich [left a lot of people in disbelief](http://i.minus.com/ibydpDUXpX4sU5.gif)

Despite a lot of fans thinking he would never live up to the hype, the England u21 captain is quickly making a reputation for himself as a reliable game changer and a possible future captain contender.

* **Downing on the Up and up**

Well fuck me..he's certainly winning a lot of people over.

Despite still being a major flop in terms of contribution he's certainly putting in more of an effort to go out on a high but a lot of fans still think he'll be best off else where. [A lot of people are asking what the fuck took him so long](http://i.imgur.com/GQQGc.gif)

*Coming up later:*

^^Sterling ^^and ^^Borini, ^^Assaidi, ^^Brad ^^Jones ^^and ^^Suarez/Sturridge

**Editor Notes:**

This would have marked my 7th month here on this subreddit and the 10th Edition of YNWSA, many had hoped I would die and this thread would disappear like the Joe Cole supporters club but still after all this time [my feelings of your guys remain the same..](http://i.imgur.com/s77Ye.gif?1)

---------------------

**Welcome back to another exiting edition of You'll Never Wildly Speculate Alone!** 

For those of you who are new during the transfer window we like to come together and have some fun at the expense at all the transfer speculation going on. 

Welcome to the world of bad puns, worse GIFs and terrible rumors.

--------------------

So according to reports, [who's on Liverpools radar?](http://i.imgur.com/TGJPt.jpg)

**[Gameiro to hero?](http://i.imgur.com/Sq5FV.jpg)**

* [Fresh reports link Liverpool with a shock loan move for PSG striker Gameiro](http://i.imgur.com/gUKkK.gif) although an already established player with recent new arrivals at PSG the striker has found himself out of favor and keen to find playing time. [Too early too get excited about it though..](http://i.minus.com/iZ0VwtAj6H8J0.gif)

**Get Real, Madrid..**

* Despite being arguably the best midfielder in the squad and having an outstanding start to his Liverpool career, Sahin has since found it hard to break into the Liverpool side [sometimes even failing to make the bench](http://i.imgur.com/6E7C2.gif). Speculation has arose over why he has failed to make the starting 11 with rumors circulating that BR wants to give the playing time to players who are staying. Remarkably, Madrid have offered to sell us Sahin at a cut price of 14m, but with limited playing time so far and [a broken nose it may be hard to convince him to stay..](http://i.minus.com/i14fbChLWuGBB.gif)

**[Sturridge shows courage](http://i.imgur.com/5EAST.jpg):**

* After spending most of his time at Chelsea as a sub and after failing to get him during the last window, Liverpool have finally secured a deal to bring in Daniel Sturridge for 12m. BR has already stated that Daniel has great potential while [some supporters fail to see his appeal](http://i.imgur.com/Y7DgQ.jpg)

**[Down n' out:](http://i.imgur.com/2Y8mT.jpg):**

* Despite Downing trying..and trying....and trying for over 2 seasons now he's never managed to fill the gap left by Kuyt, costing Liverpool 18m and only producing 1 goal and 1 assist in the league in that time (or 8m a goal, 8m an assist) he's been told he can leave and has been linked to a number of other clubs much to the delight of LFC fans...[with offers rumored to be around 7-8m](http://i.imgur.com/5823l.jpg)

**[Nothing but the best since Tom Ince left:](http://i.imgur.com/vLhK6.jpg)**

* Likely to replace him is [**former** Liverpool academy player Tom Ince](http://i.imgur.com/cKr2i.gif). Despite leaving 18 months ago for 250,000 the young winger has gone on to become a leading player in the Championship for Blackpool and a bid of 4m was made by LFC..however, Blackpool reportedly rejected that bid and are instead asking [for around 6m](http://i.imgur.com/8DyeG.gif)

**QPR goal to land Cole:**

* [We must do everything in our power to keep Joe Cole..](http://i.imgur.com/P79tv.gif) said no fan anywhere.

  of all the unlikely hero's, QPR are looking to take Joe Cole and his ridiculous wages on loan with the option to buy him, however the option to buy him will only apply if they stay in the prem..currently they are dead last but with this new information [Liverpool fans are all praying for the same thing...](http://i.imgur.com/i5FRc.gif)

**[You'll Never Walk Alonso:](http://i.imgur.com/hDMJx.jpg)**

* Xabi Alonso, Living Liverpool legend and considered to be one of the best passers in the world has revealed he  will NOT be renewing his contract with Madrid when it expires. What at first appeared to be him considering retiring was swept away when he said he had no plans to and said [he would not rule out a return to the prem](http://i.imgur.com/Bnv7r.gif).

**Liverpool targets according to the Daily Fail:**

* [Ozil, Gotze, Villa, Ba, Cisse, Drogba, Huntalaar, Torres, Hooper..](http://i.imgur.com/Zj5J9.gif)

---------------------------

**Quick Round up:**


* Rumors were circling that BR would be willing to keep Joe Cole if he took a substantial pay cut..[Joe Cole and his Agent said they would '*Think about it'*](http://i.imgur.com/mem8e.gif)

* Suso, Brad Jones and Sahin have suffered from heavy tackles this season and in response BR said he would make it clear that opposing teams [know the rules when it comes to dealing with his players](http://i.imgur.com/UDyZ2.gif)

* With Sterling performing above and beyond this season BR was keen to see to it that he stays put. [Negotiations with his agent was met with less enthusiasm...](http://i.imgur.com/YftVs.gif)

* After a string of bad, inconsistent performances Enrique looked like he was on his way out. [questions arose when BR put him in midfield but..he showed us](http://i.imgur.com/mCk1W.gif)

* Despite very few members of the team having injury problems, BR for *some strange reason* has insisted we do all in our power to secure [this transfer target](http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc6/199474_379472175456901_60839363_n.jpg)

This is a one time use account but I feel like I owe a lot of you an explanation, then I will answer any questions I can, as best as I can. 

Im truly shocked and humbled by your response, kind words and thoughts.

I've said it many times before, I don't and have NEVER created posts or commented for my own benefit
but i do so because I love interacting with you and this community. You are all such a positive, 
interesting and good looking people that I actually enjoy being part of it and I have never found a community
anywhere else that comes close to you. 

(*soppy and emotional*, but true)

---------------------------

* **The Downing Situation:**

You all know about the Downing post by now, I made the post after seeing a report on Sky Sports News
TV that Sunderland were interested on taking Downing out on Loan. SD being a hot topic I made the post
with the expectation that things were going to escalate and more information would come out during the day,
but it didn't. 

The rumor (like so many others during EVERY TW) turned out to be false and people were left with a post 
from me that they couldn't quite understand.

The Title 'Wait for the media to confirm it, Downing on Loan to Sunderland' was interpreted in two ways.

*How I intended it to read;*

'**wait for the media to confirm it**, Downing on loan to Sunderland' 

this group knew I was posting a Transfer
Rumor and that despite the hype (I was expecting to escalate) we should wait until it is confirmed.

*How a lot of members read it;*

' ^^wait ^^for ^^the ^^media ^^to ^^confirm ^^it, **Downing on loan to Sunderland**' 

this group assumed I had
made some kind of ITK official statement, but that was not the case and as many times as I tell people, some
people still wont get it in their heads that I am NOT an ITK.

I had no access to the internet or TV all day so by time I got home and went to check up on things, I was
shocked to see no new news on the rumor/transfer on Downing. Having spent a long time on this sub, I was hoping
and assumed that somebody would have found a few website links or reports that gave more information on the rumor
(like what happens in most rumor posts here) and posted them in the comments. 

Nope. 

There was almost nothing on the story and it looked like I pulled the rumor from thin air and thankfully
and a long time after I made the post somebody found a [twitter link from a journalist that backed that there WAS
a Downing to Sunderland on loan rumor](https://twitter.com/JNorthcroft/status/290181961480286208) even if it was
false.

By then It didn't matter. Of course there were some justifiably angry people and I don't blame them for being upset,
I apologized for the cryptic message and for leaving everybody confused and then explained myself. 
But their were some who just used it as fuel to the fire for their already well established personal hatred of me.

* **The PM situation:**

I've said in the past and to the people that PM me to talk, that from time to time ill get the odd angry PM and although at first
they bothered me, I eventually got used to them and either ignored them or set the record straight calmly. 

Yesterday seemed to be the tipping point for a lot of the guys that didn't like me, I received maybe 30+ PM's, some simply asking me to provide links, evidence, further information all standard reasonable PM's.

The rest however ranged from bitter to just pure cuntish, varying from how I've ruined this sub by posting shit about players I don't like and I hide behind my name to enforce my own views on people and how I make out like Im an ITK  and Im a cunt and you said Walcott and Huntelaar were 100% guaranteed buys and they didn't come, your a lier and everyone sucks your dick, your lying about your grandparents dying and illness to get attention blah blah blah..

That of course was a quick summary of the topics they covered and it may not sound devastating when listed like that but there were one or two PM's that got really, REALLY personal, threatening to tell people who I was, where I lived, family info.. all this because they just didn't like me and my post, I was seriously shocked and with how things at home had been going I found it all a bit too much and decided I had enough.

* **Deleting ElevenReds and the response:**

I deleted the account early in the morning and no more than 20 minutes later somebody had noticed and reported it to everybody else (SwingYaGucciRag, thank you for your support from day one brother!) Most people figured out pretty quickly that the PM's may have been the cause although nobody knew what was said. 

I got in touch with the Mods who were brilliant and have been brilliant since I first signed up as ElevenReds, they have been fully supportive and really patient and they fully understood my situation. 

I wasn't going to get in direct contact with you guys for a few months while things settled down but after coming by  to see whats going on during LFC vs UNITED day I was shocked, humbled and surprised to find a petition for ME to come back had been made! not only that but an incredible amount of you upvoted it and showed your support and shared your kind words. 

I read through every bodies comments, concerns, questions and complaints to try and get an idea of how I should handle the situation.

* **The Good, The Bad and The Ugly...**

**The Good**

A lot of the comments were great to hear, I really liked hearing that you guys like having me around and enjoy my posts, comments and talking to me! That said I think a lot of you give me *waaay* too much credit, I merely create the posts **YOU** guys and girls of the community make them work and worthwhile and when I comment I just try to speak honestly but respectfully as to why I think what I think. There are also a lot of contributors, posters and commenters that contribute as much and a lot more than I do and I think its very unfair people single me out and not them.

Some people seem to think I think Im never wrong or I only get upvoted based on my name but the truth is I get put in my place and corrected all the time, but, when Im wrong I listen and learn. I still make mistakes or say unpopular things all the time but not as frequently because I've learned from the other members in this community. As for Upvoted just for being ElevenReds, people since the first YNWSA have downvoted me regardless of what I post or say just because Im ElevenReds, regardless people who do like me love to challenge what I think and say not out of spite but to improve everyone's understanding on the point im trying to make and to help me improve it. 

**The Bad:**

The infamous Walcott and Huntelaar posts... the same thing that gets brought up whenever a transfer post and my name gets brought up and yet most people completely misunderstood the posts and the point I was getting at..

Yes, I did tell you information that I should NOT have told you regardless if it was getting reported and I promised id never publicly reveal information like that. BUT, a lot of you misunderstood the difference between me saying 'yes were interested in signing him and talking with his agent' and 'were going to sign him'. I told people we had contacted both their agents and their was interest, I then said **in my own opinion based on the information at the time** that I believed we'd sign one of them if not both of them, that was my personal belief. I also mentioned that for any deal both sides have to agree and that situations and circumstances change but people forget to mention me saying that, regardless Huntelaar changed his mind yet Walcott is still in question but it looks like he's getting ready to settle at Arsenal. Yet some people refuse to let this go and bring up old comments from months ago, like I tell them I had to base my opinions on the info available at the time but I apologize for getting peoples hopes up.

**The Ugly:** 

Im not an ITK... of any kind, I've said this SO MANY times now its embarrassing when people tell people I think I am or I 'claim' to be..never happened.

Using my past and current employment situation as leverage in discussion or for intimidating people against disagreeing with me: I will NEVER EVER do that ever on anyone, everybody is welcome to say anything to me, I love discussing or debating different Ideas so to hear people say they wont say anything to me because of fear of downvotes from others is ridiculous. I will also NEVER post anything publicly that can get me or anyone else in trouble 

some people are getting angry at how people have reacted to me deleting my account, like i and others have said there are a lot more brilliant contributors on this sub that dont get nearly as much credit as they deserve, but please understand i got on well with a lot of people and understand their frustration that I decided to go because of a few members.

Luis was wrong, but before we hound him out let's remember there have been other Liverpool legends who were not exactly saints
By JAMIE CARRAGHER

Before you carry on reading, it is important to make this point: this is not me trying to defend the indefensible. This is an attempt to put some perspective on the Luis Suarez saga.
It was said in the aftermath of Sunday’s game against Chelsea, firstly by Graeme Souness as he began his analysis on Sky, that nobody is  bigger than the club and that Liverpool should make Luis pay the heaviest penalty by getting rid of him.
Now I am not for one moment trying to sugar-coat the incident in which Luis bit Branislav Ivanovic. It was wrong on all levels. You simply don’t expect to see a grown man bite another grown man — that is behaviour you would  associate with nursery school.

But the way things are now being pitched is that Liverpool have got to do something about the rotten apple in their midst. 
It is as if Luis is the only player to have represented Liverpool who has ever been embroiled in controversy.
That simply isn’t the case.

We have had it many times before, as have every other club in the country. I know this as I was responsible for one incident in January 2002. I threw a coin into the crowd at Highbury during an FA Cup tie against Arsenal after one had  initially been flung at me.

Souness, who was captain of Liverpool at the time, broke the jaw of Dinamo Bucharest’s Lica Movila during a European Cup semi-final in 1984 when he punched him in an off-the-ball incident. 
It was a serious incident but it is one which fans and some of his old team-mates speak almost nostalgically about.

Robbie Fowler had his scrapes, too. There was outrage after he celebrated a goal against  Everton in April 1999 by mimicking drug taking. A couple of months earlier he was hugely condemned when he taunted Graeme Le Saux with a homophobic gesture.
Jan Molby was sent to jail in October 1988 for three months for a drink-driving offence. 

More recently, Steven Gerrard appeared in court charged with affray but was subsequently found not guilty.  
Every one of the players I mention regretted what happened and Luis is the same. More importantly, the club stood by every one of them.

Luis is normally a bubbly lad around the training ground. He tends to mix mainly with the other South Americans in the group but he is well liked all around because he has a fantastic attitude to his job and just loves playing football.

'I'd rather be bitten than have my leg broken'
 
In my time at Liverpool, very few players have possessed an appetite to win the same as mine but Luis has got it. He trains well every day. When we get a day off, he will come in to do extra work and there is nothing arrogant or flash about him. He slots into the group without problem.

Yesterday, however, it was clear that events had taken a toll. 
Luis knows he has done something seriously wrong, letting  himself down. He has been told that a repeat of such behaviour will not be tolerated and the club’s stance has been different from how it was following his altercation with Patrice Evra.
But, rather than hounding him out of the country, shouldn’t we be helping him? 

We have a top psychologist in Steve Peters who comes to the club once a week and he could have as big a role as our manager, Brendan Rodgers, for Luis.

Ian Ayre has stated that the club are not looking to sell Luis. History shows that message has always been the same. What happened when Tony Adams was released from jail in February 1991 after serving a sentence for drink- driving?

He went back to captain Arsenal and won eight major  honours. Look at Eric Cantona. 

Less than eight months after returning from his eight-month ban for an assault on Crystal Palace fan Matthew Simmons, he had inspired Manchester United to the Double. It is selfish but clubs need their best players.

As Martin Samuel said in his column yesterday, perhaps if a player of lesser ability had been guilty of Luis’s offence, he would have been shown the door by now. Again, a precedent at Anfield has already been set.

During the Hillsborough memorial service in 2009, Charles Itandje and Damien Plessis were caught laughing and messing around. Itandje, a third-choice keeper with a terrible attitude, was banished immediately. Plessis, who was viewed as being a player of promise, was admonished but stayed.
Morally you could say such standards are wrong but it happens in any walk of life, not just football. If someone is exceptional at what they do, many people are prepared to put up with them regardless of the hassle they may cause.  


People may say this is a  Liverpool-biased opinion but I don’t want to see another world-class player leave the Barclays  Premier League, like Xabi Alonso, Cristiano Ronaldo and Cesc Fabregas have. 
We are talking about one of the top five players in world football here. 
Finally, I would like to finish by putting forward a thought from a footballer’s perspective about the incident. 

The bite was shocking, no question, and everyone who has seen it was amazed. Yet was it worse than a challenge that could end someone’s career? 

I know what it is like to have your leg broken by a reckless tackle. Lucas Neill cost me six months of my career in September 2003 when he played for Blackburn. Would I have preferred to have been  bitten? Absolutely. 

I suspect that Branislav Ivanovic, who has conducted himself with great credit in the aftermath, would agree. You can get up and carry on after a skirmish. If someone shatters your leg, you wonder whether you will play again.

**Transfer Special**

* So its finally happened, Stewart Downing [has left liverpool](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/stop.gif)

* Although praised for his gradual improved work rate most fans feel the Winger to have been a flop only producing 7 goals but playing in over 91 games...[oh, and on £80,000 a week](http://i.imgur.com/O8g58pD.gif)

* With Downing's key spot now vacant the front page has quickly been filling up with [suggestions of suitable replacements](http://i.imgur.com/3dQej1W.gif)

* After coming to the club for a reported £20m fans were delighted to make a [return of £5-6m only 2 years later](http://i.imgur.com/QciOtS1.gif)

* [Who is BR reportedly lining up to replace him?](http://i.imgur.com/UaNdTtj.gif)

^^join ^^us ^^on ^^the ^^second ^^update ^^to ^^find ^^out!

* [Oh Jay spearing left too](http://i.imgur.com/wXYo2t2.gif)

----------------------------------

**In other news**

* After much heated speculation since the start of the window the Suarez transfer drama has died down, although there was a lot of 'contract clause' talk early on, it now turns out his agent, Pere Guardiola [didnt have a clue what he's talking about](http://i.imgur.com/239ijkF.gif)

* In response, Suarez and his agent/team promised in the meantime he would only ['concentrate on his football'](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/xCukw7m.gif)

* ...of course he didn't and despite repeatedly blaming the media of victimizing him in the past, he enraged fans by giving a shock telegraph interview, where he accused BR of lying and [then threatend the club with legal action](http://i.imgur.com/Bi5t0Vs.gif)

* the Quote that confused fans the most was when he asked that Liverpool [*set him free..'*](http://i.imgur.com/qbh0zMw.gif)

[..BR on the other hand was reported to have been 'upset' by Suarez actions](http://i.imgur.com/Gdlfncz.gif)

[and arsenal fans commenting in support of Luis on this sub quickly discovered we differ in opinion](http://i.imgur.com/opFc034.gif) 

* The PFA canme quickly to our rescue to say that Suarez and his agent had no legal ground, BR was certainly happy his tough stance paid off and has since forced suarez to train alone which he'll remain doing until he apologizes to him and the team, [its reported that suarez has no such intentions](http://i.imgur.com/lJmeaJP.gif)

* Daniel Agger was reported to have had two bids from Barcelona rejected, although some fans fear [a third final &amp; bigger bid is on its way](http://i.imgur.com/EFy9n3c.gif)

but Agger in all his awesomeness was made vice captain and [declared his on going love for the club on twitter](http://i.imgur.com/SKXFsgX.gif)

In the second half we're talking Jay Spearing, Stewart Downing, Raheem Sterling Archers run in with the law, Steven Gerrard Testimonial, Michael Owen, Ajax and Arsenal!! 

Until then feel free to fight in the comments

I know the hive mind, and I know the general opinions on the hottest subjects here.

I'm writing to you all because of the confrontations between us and r/gunners, whom I also visit on a semi regular basis. Here is my view:

Both subreddits are full of subscribers that call each other delusional. I am not innocent from these types of accusations myself. The more I read from each subreddit, the more I realize that once your break through the surfaces, we are pretty much mirror images of each other. We both have a minority that spews nonsense, and we both have a hivemind mentality that generously upvotes comments in favor of the hive mind. The fact of the matter is, is that we both have rational reasons as to why we believe Suarez is staying or going, and we both have personal agendas on what we hope the outcome to be. Now, we all need to take a good look at each other in the eyes, and agree that no subreddit is better then the other, but rather each is just as bad as the other. Neither subreddit is full of blameless saints. 

In the end, supporters will always have their personal opinions, and this should be a safe place to share them. It is now the responsibility of each subreddit to discern what is rational and contributes positively, and what does not.

That being said, carry on, you delusional fans.

1357528078.0,111,self.LiverpoolFC,163in1,Coates loan: the right idea.,severedfragile,117,6,56,http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/163in1/coates_loan_the_right_idea/,"There were a lot of problems with our performance today (resorting to long balls when passing became difficult, dwelling on the ball, Jonjo's shooting, etc.) but the biggest was that when we were under pressure in the second half, the defence seemed to withdraw into the box and let it come. That's partially down to the inexperience of the full-backs, partially down to poor shielding from the midfield and partially down to the slowness of Carra and Coates, but it's also down to the way the CB's played it.

Coates (and Carra, but to a slightly lesser extent) is too *reactive* a defender, he says ""I'll stop you"" whereas Skagger's attitude is ""Fuck you, we're not even going to let you try."" Everyone focuses on the passing game, but pressing when we don't have the ball is just as important a means to an end as passing, and that goes for our defenders as much as anyone else. Robinson, Flanagan et al can be forgiven to some extent, but the central defenders *have* to shut attacks down before they get to the box. Granted, plenty of Mansfield's attacks came from set-pieces and the attitude and energy they showed in the second half would have put pressure on many defences, but the reactive nature of our back 4 allowed it to continue, and meant we'd win the ball in our own box and have very few options further up the pitch to send it to.

Coates, in some ways, seems like an ideal Rodgers defender, but in terms of his aggression from the back, is completely wrong. He's actually more suited to Benitez or Houllier , but that's another conversation; Rodgers needs defenders who'll win the ball further up the pitch, and at the moment he doesn't do that. Hopefully he'll learn, but today did a lot to win me over to Rodgers' side on this one. I don't want us to sell Seb yet because I believe he'll turn into a very good defender, but he'll have to go somewhere where he can improve his reading, aggression and ball-winning further up the pitch before he can become an option Rodgers wants to keep.

1351607611.0,102,self.LiverpoolFC,12c7ia,Our hero ,I_eat_footballs,117,15,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/12c7ia/our_hero/,"There’s never been a player quite like Luis Suarez at Liverpool. Well of course, we've had various, talented footballers that have possessed some of his components individually, but the eclectic and ferocious mix the Uruguayan possesses is as unique to him as it is entertaining to us.

 Quick feet, entrancing skill, superb shooting, tuned aggression and a talent for the unexpected have been fused with an irrepressible desire to win football matches that few in the world possess, to make the insatiable Suarez one of the most likeable and gifted footballers of the 21st century.

 At least, amongst his own fans.

 Hand signals, chants, shouting and even coins rained down on Suarez as he weaved his magic upon the field of Liverpool’s arch rivals, in a typical Goodison Park derby.

 A game like this never looks for pretty passing or technical brilliance, all it needs is a hero, a villain, and a talking point.

 Suarez dutifully provided all three.

 For the Liverpool fans, he was everything they wanted and needed from a player in a derby. Backed by a gritty, determined and passionate performance from his team-mates, he led the line with furious dedication. Whether dropping deep to trade off passes or latching on to balls over the top, Suarez was magnificent. He tracked back to tackle the ball out for a throw in. He chased lost causes. He was the first to everything that came his way, and once the ball was at his feet, he made sure that magic followed.

 Consistently turning defenders, with his potent combination of quick feet and unpredictability, he gave Everton’s back four no room for complacency, proving a challenge to stop both on and off the ball.

 He also scored. Somehow only once.

 He first fired upon goal with a fierce volley that deflected in of the unfortunate Leighton Baines, and added to the travelling Kopites joy minutes later with a perfectly deft header to make it 2-0.

 As for the Everton fans, they exhibited the kind of hostility that has followed the Uruguayan all season, and was doubtless stoked by the pre-match comments of David Moyes in relation to diving.

 It was Moyes, not Suarez who emerged embarrassed when the latter hit the Goodison floor though. After putting Liverpool ahead, Suarez gleefully made his way to the sidelines, falling humorously to the floor in front of the Everton manager.

 Brendan Rodgers would later call it “Scouse wit,” and it was. Reminiscent of Robbie Fowler’s sniffing celebration after scoring against the Blues in 1999, Suarez showed a sense of humour, the most potent retort of all, in celebrating his goal, and endeared himself even more to the travelling supporters while incensing the home fans.

 Phil Neville later emphasised Suarez’s point by being booked for diving.

 Meanwhile Marouane Fellaini kicked, shoved and wrestled players to the ground as punishment for them being quicker than him, deliberately kicking both Joe Allen and Raheem Sterling from behind. Yet it was Suarez, who several times did well to stay on his feet after cumbersome challenges, that remained a “cheat.”

 And then there was that goal. The goal that was and the goal that wasn’t.

 Smashing the ball into the roof of the net after a knock-down from Sebastian Coates, Suarez had done it. He peeled away celebrating as the ground shook with the joyful exuberance of his fans, for the game had been won, in dramatic, late and great fashion.

 For a few seconds anyway. For the linesman had ruled offside, and the score remained at 2-2. Replays showed the linesman had been desperately incorrect, and the delay of the flag caused Gary Neville to suggest after the game that the official had “bottled it”.

 Even Moyes conceded that Everton were fortunate not to have lost the game in that moment.

 And what of Suarez? Angry, raging, in the referee’s face? No.

 He smiled.

 As he jogged back into position, he knew that he had been onside, and he knew the decision had gone against him unfairly, as it had time and time again this season.

 It was the same smile that was spread across his face as he performed his diving celebration, and the same that he displayed when he was awarded a free-kick in the second half, pointing at himself as if to say “Me? Fouled? Why, thank you!”

 Suarez’s humour didn't end there. When a coin thrown from the stands landed in his proximity, he simply tucked it into his boot quietly and walked into the area, ready to try and get his head on the incoming corner.

 As the boos, chants and insults of opposition fans rained down upon him, he concentrated on two things. First the game, and then his own fans.

 Turning away from the hatred and bile, he looked towards the section of the ground bathed in the red of Liverpool, and waved.

 For whatever reason, Luis Suarez is the pantomime villain of the Premier League. But where some players might crumble and tire from the constant battering, he simply stands firm, performs well, and scores goals. Opposition fans don’t like him? So be it. The people that matter appreciate and adore him for not only his footballing talent, but his unique and unbeatable desire and determination to win every game he participates in.

 He is often criticized for exhibiting such anger in the face of decisions not going his way, of fouls not being given and such like, but Suarez has begun to simply laugh at such mistakes. Having been kicked from pillar to post for 90 minutes only to receive nothing, most players would be spitting blood, enraged and inconsolable. It is remarkable that the Uruguayan's temperament is criticized under such ridiculous treatment from opposition players and referees, but it is.

 Because the world needs a villain. The world needs a talking point. And right now, Luis Suarez is English football’s answer to both.

 But to Liverpool fans, he is something else entirely.

 Goals, assists, nutmegs, chance creations, and now comedy celebrations. He has been involved in 80% of Liverpool’s goals this season, and in his 4 derby games, he has been involved in six goals, with three of his own and three assists.

 Luis Suarez, you know what you are? Our hero.",,False,self,t5_2qn0o,False,,lfc12,True,t3_12c7ia,http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/12c7ia/our_hero/,

Nothing could say to me any clearer how genuinely different and excellent Liverpool Football Club and its supporters are. Of course, I mean different in the way that ~~all~~ most other football club subreddits are infested with hatred and spite, while this one is a place of understanding, and hell it's even a place of compassion and heart and loyalty.



I see familiar usernames and smile, because it feels like I'm seeing a good friend even if I've never replied once to that person. I could shout some names out, but that's just singling out people who might be made to feel awkward by this. 




Anyway, visiting this community and contributing to the ongoing conversation is one of the most rewarding and fulfilling parts of my day. Karma means nothing in comparison to the joy of talking to you lovely people.



As we chat back and forth, even bickering sometimes, the gravity of LFC's immense history keeps us grounded, and adds a whole new dimension of emotion to both watching our boys storm the pitch, and to us sitting here talking about it.



I'm proud to be a Liverpool fan, and I'm proud to be a member of /r/LiverpoolFC.

1344329678.0,89,self.LiverpoolFC,xtd3z,A guide to calculating the real cost of players,nikcub,94,5,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/xtd3z/a_guide_to_calculating_the_real_cost_of_players/,"**Decided to post this as a self since I was late with my comment in the relevant thread. Added additional info**

It is great that amongst LFC supporters considering the wage and signon costs of players in a transfer is beginning to catch on. I am seeing the realization awaken in people steadily over time. It is better that we have an informed fan base that understands how the financial side of football works so that we can be realistic about expectations and better judges of club performance and transfers. Transfer fees are a small part of the total cost of a player, and the more fans that understand this, the better, so that we can send out constructive feedback to the club rather than ridiculous comments like ""Carroll! we shoulda bought Aguero"".

Here is how the cost of a player is calculated.

You take their weekly wages and multiply it out by the length of the contract, and you add the signon bonus and agent fees). So for eg. lets do this with Andy Carroll and Joe Allen

Joe Allen: £40k per week, 6 year deal = £12.4M

Andy Carroll: £80k per week, 5.5 year deal = £24.3M 

Add on the transfer fee of each player to that total

Joe Allen: £12.4M + £15M = £27.4M

Andy Carroll: £24.3M + £35M = £59.3M

To get your annual cost for each season, you divide this back again by the length of the contract:

Joe Allen: £27.4M / 6 years = £4.56M per year

Andy Carroll: £59.3M / 5.5 years = £10.7M per year

This has no reflection on how money actually moves (eg. transfers may be all upfront, or spread out over years, wages may be paid monthly, or twice a year etc.) but it is how the clubs reflect player costs on the books so it is all that really matters.

On top of that, you *can* account (but a lot of clubs don't) the remaining time on the contract multiplied by the transfer fee as an asset. 

The players wages (along with the wages of staff) are a single line item in financial reports. The player cost is a separate line item again, as player amortization. There are three ways to buy players, you either pay a decent transfer fee to get a player who has low wages (and that is the reason he has a decent fee), or you have cheap players who are on high wages and tough to get rid of (Bellamy twice) or you pay both a high transfer fee and high wages for worldwide stars.

Year | 2006 | 2007 | 2008 | 2009 | 2010 | 2011 
:----|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:
**Turnover** (£M) | 119.5 | 133.9 | 159.1 | 177.3 | 184.5 | 183.6
Wages                          | 68.9 | 77.6 | 89.7 | 96.1 | 114.3 | 128.9 
Player Amortization       | 25.2 | 31.1 | 32.5 | 37.4 | 39.9 | 36.3
**Total player costs** | 94.1 | 108.7 | 122.2 | 133.5 | 154.2 | 165.2


**Edit:** To add a note here, in the table above you can see how much more wages account for 'cost' then amortization (which is transfer fees). Note our large jumps in wages while our player amortization remained about even, this is the H&amp;G effect of having to sign cheap, high-risk players on high wages.

I was going to add a line showing our table position for each year, but that is just too embarrassing. It highlites the deadwood in our player costs compared to performance.


When Liverpool were under H&amp;G we didn't have ready cash reserves and we owed so many clubs money that we were not getting transfer offers accepted on normal club terms (eg. pay it out later, whatever) because our credit was useless with other clubs. We resorted to finding mediocre expensive players who were on high wages. High wages are easier to pay because they come out of monthly revenue such as gate receipts. All the other money, such as sponsorship payments, player transfer income, etc. went down on the debt (we found this out later).

This is why offloading that list of players I put [out here before the window started](http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/tvd6j/is_anyone_else_scared_that_we_might_loose_some/c4q5wml?context=3) is a good thing, and why I cheered on every one of these sales. Deadwood is any large contract where the player isn't putting in the performance to justify the fee. My list of the players at the time who were on high wages but were not performing, a hangover of the old regime of large wages, low transfer fees, was:

* Kuyt
* Alberto
* Maxi
* Wilson (apparently on 40-50k)
* Jones 
* Cole
* Aurelio
* Bellamy

Players on large wages who are ok: Reina, Johnson, Gerrard. Players to be considered for offloading: Adam, Spearing. And then loaned out: Shelvey and a bunch of young players all on £500-1M p.a. I have no idea what type of wages Downing is on, but Carroll is also not working out considering his wage packet.

With that £35M off the books we can now spend that money in a mixture of transfers and reasonable wages, you can see from above that it basically makes up 7 Joe Allen-like transfers. New signings must be on low wages, because of how high the failure rate is of new transfers. If Joe Allen doesn't work out, we would easily have a number of clubs ready to take him since he is so cheap overall. If we gave Sig £70k per week and then he didn't work out, we would just be replacing one Acquillani with another (this is no comment on Sig as a player, just reality).

It is **amazing** that we have managed to offload so many players. Even with the compensation we are paying for Alberto and Bellamy, we must be on target because we actually got a transfer fee for Kuyt and a fee for Alberto. There is only Cole to go.

I really never thought we would achieve so much so soon in the offseason, I really thought we would be stuck with at least 2 or 3 of these guys. This has been excellent work from the club so far, now we just have to see what they are going to do with all of the expenditure space.

That said, I don't think we should go to what Arsenal were doing, since they have abandoned that model themselves now. They had a 'narrow' wage structure, where the theory is that the entire squad contributes to the success of the team and each first team member is on wages in a band between £45-90k. So you have fringe players at Arsenal taking up 50k per week while no ability to retain top talent like RVP. The Spurs structure is similar, but at a lower scale, their max was £60k per week and they had player like Modric on £40k and Bale on £25k.

The idea wage structure would be new signings on 30-50k per week, depending on who they are. Upcoming players, or the 'future stars' can not be paid more than £10-20k, so that they can be loaned out for experience cheap. That would mean that the base wage bill is 30 players * £35k per week which is £54M. You then give the large wages to proven first team members: Gerrard, Johnson, Reina (already there) and now Skrtel and Agger - give them each 100-125k to retain them and the wage bill becomes £110M. Add to that staffing and coaches and we are in the reasonable ballpark of sensible wages.

I don't think we should be selling Agger and/or Skrtel in order to get more wage space. We wouldn't be able to replace them. I think part of the new £30-35M in space should go towards rewarding them with new deals, while the rest can go on 4 or 5 Joe Allen-like signings.

**Edit II:** I hope this also explains why selling Carroll on a 'loan to buy' makes sense and would (in theory - considering if the rumor to West Ham was true) suit both parties. West Ham get to start amortizing his transfer fee next season when they have the Premier League TV income on their books, while Liverpool can remove the large part of his contract from the books and spend that money even though he hasn't left the club. Loan to buys were a way around signing players outside of transfer windows, but they have started to suit clubs because of the way they can be accounted for in financial reports. In the Carroll case, we would remove his wages of £4M per year and the £2M loan fee can go towards his amortization, which would immediately free up £6M on the books to spend on a new player (again, you can measure this as 1.5 'joe allens' - which is why you can start to see why BR may want to do this deal). Even though it is only £6M now, it means buying a £20M player, plus wages (or two 'joe allens' :))Then at the end of the year we plug the £17M fee in as income, remove the amortization fee and account the difference as a negative in a separate column.",,False,self,t5_2qn0o,1344334592.0,,lfc68,True,t3_xtd3z,http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/xtd3z/a_guide_to_calculating_the_real_cost_of_players/,

**Who Is He?**

If you ever watched a Reserves game last season, chances are you've already seen 19 year old Ngoo play. Quite frankly he's not hard to miss: [at a whopping 6' 4""](http://www1.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/Michael+Ngoo+Liverpool+U19+v+Ajax+U19+NextGen+p6IDj_mBXtxl.jpg), the English U-20 international towers over his opponents (in comparison, Carroll is 6' 3"" and Seba Coates is 6' 5""!). 

Born in London, Michael Ngoo started out in League Two Side Southend United's youth system. Ngoo had actually been on trial with rivals Manchester United, even playing and scoring for them in the Milk Cup Final, before Liverpool rescued him from an unfortunate future. In September 2009, The Reds captured his signature for a fee rising as much as £250,000.

In his first season (2010-11) as a Red, Ngoo scored 15 goals in 21 appearances (majority from the bench) for the Under-18's. He was rewarded for his great form by being promoted full-time to the Reserves and also getting called-up for England. In the 2011-12 season, Ngoo became a vital member Rodolfo Borrell's Reserve side that ended 3rd in the Next-Gen tournament. Ngoo finished the season as the Reserves' top scorer in alll competition netting nine goals.

.

.


**What Kind Of Player Is He?**

Ngoo is not your typical English #9. Ngoo is'nt a target man who thrives off floated crosses to his head but rather short passes to his feet. Ngoo possess a wonderful first touch and dribbling skills reminiscent of Peter Crouch. 

However when he first came Ngoo was criticized for being quite wasteful in front of goal. With strong competition from Adam ""The Next Fowler"" Morgan, Rodolfo Borrell decided to push Ngoo out wide to help him learn to use his footwork to beat a man instead of just his height...and boy did it help. 

You'll often see him in games charging at the opponents whilst performing perfect step-overs. Centre-backs just stand in amazement, having no damn clue how to defend against Ngoo's lanky and hilarious octopus-like runs. Just today he scored against Crystal Palace to put his tally at 17 goals in last 15 Reserves/U21s games!

I'll keep this simple; we're not there yet, but we're close. Just as close as we've ever been in the past, but we're nothing like the same squad that beat ManU 4-1 in 08/09. I think we're better; more diverse. 

We're growing in such a sustainable fashion what once we're there, we'll be cemented there. We won't be ""knocked off that perch"" as easily this time around.

And what makes it all these successes more fucking enjoyable is that we've gone through the shit times. We've been there. Watching this success will be just as fulfilling to me as it is to the actual goalscorers.

As a Scouser, even one who was not born then, this tragedy will always be in our hearts, and the 96 will never be forgotten.

Too many good people were lost that day, and now the rest of the world finally know the truth, the real truth, as to what happened 24 years ago.

My dad was there on the day, and the stories he tells makes your blood boil and your heart break at the same time. He knew from day one what had happened, and ever since I was old enough to understand, I've known too.

It's very rare that I see my dad cry, but he tears up when he talks about Hillsborough. He was one of the heroes that tried to save people, when the police were stopping ambulances from getting on the pitches. He was threatened with being arrested when he was helping people pull down the advertising to use as stretchers. He tried his best, as did everyone at that match, but 96 still had to needlessly die.

Every fan at that match was a hero in my eyes, and it disgusts me that they have had to endure 24 years of insults, lies and slander, when all they did was try to help.

And though I may not have been alive then, I'm proud of my city, and of my dad. I'm proud to be from a city where all differences are put aside in respect for those who didn't return, whether you be red or blue. I'm proud to be the son of a man who tried his best to save his fellow fans.

My dad probably doesn't realise that a massive reason why I look up to him is because of what he's told me about that day. I know he'll probably never tell me everything, as some things still hurt too much. But I'll always think he, and every other fan, was a hero that day.

Wisdom 40′: **LFC 2** - 1 YB

**Second Half**

Shelvey 76′: **LFC 4** - 3 YB

Shelvey 87': **LFC 5** - 3 YB

---------------------------------------
**ElevenReds MOTM:** - Jonjo Shelvey

Potential future Captain. Came on lead the midfield, keep the team moving forward, controlled the pace, doesnt panic, stays calm, strong.

Class, absolutely class player 

**BONUS FACT:** Did you know Jonjo Shelvey studies one on one under Steven Gerrard? 

---------------------------------------

**Special Mentions**

**Brad Jones** - Despite the 3 goals in he made some brilliant saves, he also made some big mistakes, score line doesnt reflect his performance.

**Jamie Carragher** - Good from what we can expect from him these days,  responsible for one of the YB goals, possible involvement in another, but was a road block at times.

**Jordan Henderson** - Had great moments and frustrating moments, if he can keep the ball better under pressure he could be a great player **SPECIAL SHOUT OUT TO HENDO FROM JONJO - Gotta give a big thanks to Hendo for two great assists 😃 ledge!!!**

**Coates** - Will be in the first team in a few years, great player in the air, not the best when stopping a counter attack

**Suso** - I can see why people are eager to see him to play, if he learns to use that right foot of his he could be an INCREDIBLE player..almost scored a Messi esqe goal 

**Assaidi** - Dayum..that boy can feed, he can also shoot, chase, attack..need to see more of him but a good game

**Sahin** - Same with Henderson, had moments that showed how brilliant he can be but was let down by the rest of the team at times

**Wisdom** - That boy can fly..

**Shelvey** - Jonjo fucking Shelvey

**Borini** - Honestly, Honestly, he looked good when he came on, he cut through, took and gave well, came close to scoring, he's clearly getting better

 Suarez watch: ^because ^fedward ^told ^me ^to


He touched the ball.



He headed the ball and the ball makes love with the woodwork. 

He touched the ball again and passed it back to the midfield. This must be a sign of Suarez's negative feelings about liverpool.


He argued for a handball. HE LOVES US.


He took a free kick and deliberately hit the wall. This must be a sign that he wants to move and make a wall between us and a champions league spot.

YNWA guys .. YNWA..

There is no point in arguing about where the goals will come from or why did we have to let Carroll go, or even whether should Gerrard be benched along with Reina. 

The reason I say this is because the inconsistency we have comes from the longest change in the club I can ever remember. We have had change of owners and change of Managers. LFC is built on greatness and always will be the best club in the world in my eyes. However the fans demand change to be immanent because this is LFC and we should be up there with the best.

Just think of the confidence level for the lads playing today, who can't seem to find rhythm to get few games together without loosing or letting a win slip away. My guess is that Man City tie hurt players more than we all saw. They saw their potential and then took it away from themselves and once again hung their heads. It is only through hard work they will get through this. It is only with BR guidance that they can start restoring their faith. It is only with YNWA being sung behind their backs, and knowledge that true LFC fans are here through thick and thin that they will be able to start getting their confidence back. I can't even imagine the pressure on Reina, Suarez and Gerrard week in and week out. 

It has been long and tough three seasons with changes in management and staff and owners. It has been three seasons of sliding down the premier league table. It will get worse, but just like I said before it is always darker before the dawn. 

Our team will rise again!!! It is not a wish but a fact! We will come together and we will start winning and we will be pushing for the top of the league again. It is what LFC does and what we help them do as a loyal fans. We will put our heads down and push harder and train harder. We will stand by our players and our manager when no one else will. THEY WILL NEVER WALK ALONE. They are our squad and our legends, they are our future talent and our present team!

Sorry for the long message you guys, but we need the belief now more than ever! Be patient my comrades, be brave and keep on singing YNWA in your heart!",,False,self,t5_2qn0o,False,,,True,t3_z8d58,http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/z8d58/ynwa/,

I've been to Anfield as a youngster but this is the first time I'd got to see them as an adult. 

Now unfortunately I was sitting with the  Toon fans but at the same time, I was only a barrier away from the away Red Fans and wow. 

The first goal I nearly cheered and screamed at until I realised I was surrounded by thousands of hardcore Toon fans. Now at this point I'm thinking, 'it's only 1-0, lets not get too carried away'.  

Then came the second, the third, the fourth, the fifth &amp; finally the sixth. 

By the fifth goal I was slightly cheering and applauding and people started to notice but I couldn't care less. 

The 6th goal came and I screamed. As loud as I could I screamed HENDOO!!! The seats around me were deserted so I let loose.  

The main experience for me was the singing. The Toon fans started with 'LUIS SUAREZ, HE BITES WHO HE WANTS'. The Reds returned with the same. 'Steve Gerrard Gerrard' rang out along with the occasional 'JOOSE JOOSE ENRIQUEEE'. No doubt to rub salt in the wounds. 

The best moment though was when the away fans sang 'Justice for the 96'. It was a beautiful moment. Along a bit from the away fans a sign went up from the Newcastle fans saying 'Justice for the 96'. The away fans responded by applauding the thought. 

I'm not going to lie, I teared up. I'm already planning an away trip to Anfield with some Newcastle fans.

1370017244.0,68,self.LiverpoolFC,1fet8h,A mildly interesting anecdote to distract from all the Suarez insanity,WDC312,79,11,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/1fet8h/a_mildly_interesting_anecdote_to_distract_from/,"I go to a very old (by American standards) fairly pretentious (by any standards) school in New England, and there's a tradition there called ""toasting"".  It consists of mixing a bunch of liquors and mixers in a big cup (like a champagne bucket) and passing it around.  Each person makes a toast and then takes a drink before passing it to the next person.  There are many customs/traditions that go along with this; one of them is that if someone not drinking has a story relevant to the toast that the person drinking just made, they can tell the story, and the person drinking has to continue drinking until the story is over.  (Isn't this tradition wonderful?)

So I was at a toasting session with one of the political groups on campus, and I made a toast to- what else?- Liverpool FC.  At this point someone at the table stands up and announces that they have a story.  Bemused, I start drinking.

""So I'm from Texas,"" he says*, ""and I live in a fairly wealthy area.  But anyway I have this neighbor who invests in sports teams.  He's owned like the Dallas Stars and the Texas Rangers and some other teams I don't remember.  At one point, I remember, this neighbor actually bought Liverpool.""  I kind of choke because I'm more than a little surprised, but get back to drinking pretty quickly.  ""Like I said, he's owned a number of teams in the past, and he still owns a bunch now.  But he was really surprised at the seriousness with which the Liverpool fans took the club- like, he started receiving death threats.""  At this point I had to put down the cup because I couldn't contain my laughter.  He goes on.  ""Yeah, he starts receiving all these letters threatening to kill him because he's ruining this great English club, he's driving it into the ground, he's a fucking American and doesn't deserve to own the great historic club of Liverpool FC.""  I'm now laughing so hard I have to actually put the cup down in order to avoid spilling it.  The guy telling the story makes it clear that he's finished, and I am castigated for not drinking all the way through.

A few months later, I'm hanging out with some people and this guy (I'd say he's an acquaintance, not a close friend) is there, so I ask him, ""Hey, [name redacted]!  What's your neighbor's name?  You know, the one you said bought Liverpool.""

He says, ""What?  Oh, Hicks.  His name is Hicks.""

So anyway, that's a little anecdote that I thought was kind of funny, and that I thought some of you guys might get a kick out of.  At least, I hope it's a nice distraction from all this Suarez business.

OK so by now you have all seen that I got that somebody was going to sign with us was **right!**...what is obvious was that I got the person (for now) **Wrong**. I am sorry about this, this Oussama Assaidi snuck right in under the radar. 

I am still **100% Confident** Sahin will/has signed for us and it will be announced next week!

**Rodgers said he is looking to make 1-2 signings this week, the club more than likely struck this deal first and decided to announce it**

Please dont let my mistake put you off viewing these posts, it was an honest mistake, right transfer, wrong person.

----------

**Special Signing Edition!**

----------------------------------

**Hey Liverpool, what you Şahin?:**

* Rodgers has been dropping hints all week about a new possible signing joining this week, but in typical fashion has given us [no hint to whom it could be...](http://i.imgur.com/zCvj5.gif)

* [But the News a lot of us have been waiting for, is about to come true](http://i.imgur.com/PS6l3.gif)

* The man in Question is Nuri Şahin, a 23 Real Madrid midfielder (surprise, surprise) who has been linked with Arsenal and Liverpool over the last couple of weeks.

* For the most part it looked like it was [dead cert he was going to be heading to Arsenal](http://i.minus.com/ibaQhwwzOeqPiI.gif)

* But what Arsenal didnt know was behind the scenes at RM, a certain Jose Mourinho and Alonso had encouraged him to head to us rather than Arsenal. [Thanks again Xabi](http://i.imgur.com/UEqx8.gif)

* Arsenal fans have so far been less than impressed with there week, first losing their second captain in recent years and now losing a signing to Liverpool, [some Arsenal fans cant tell whats worse..](http://i.imgur.com/QPw8I.gif)

* The news on Şahin year long loan is supposed to be announced later on today

**Tello? Is anyone there?**

* Cristian Tello is another player we have been linked with, not for the first time either. 

* He recently said he's happy at Barca and will see how things progress before making any further decisions 

* Although at the moment it may not look as certain as it once did, there is hope that he will sign/loan out to us next season, so for the moment [all we need to do is watch and wait](http://i.imgur.com/yZR0v.gif)

**Dempsey and his shit non rhyming name**

* Missed more training at Fulham, says he wouldnt mind a move, nobody has a clue what he wants or what he's doing

* [A lot of Liverpool fans are wondering if we want or need him now](http://i.imgur.com/FTvJ6.gif)

---------------------------------------
**THIS JUST IN SPECIAL!!** (for the second week in a row important news has come in like this..unreal)

**I KNOW I MAY HAVE SAID WHEN I POSTED THIS THAT DEMPSEY WAS BECOMING A LONG SHOT...WELL, FROM THE REPORTS IM SEEING AND AN INTERESTING PHONE CALL FROM MY [SACUE](http://www.thinkgeek.com/images/products/frontsquare/dc05_awesomesauce_hot_sauce.jpg) CLINT IS RUMOURED TO BE SET TO [JOIN THE CLUB](http://i.imgur.com/FrHO0.gif)**

**From what I hear it'll be announced this week-early next week.**

---------------------------------------
* Also Linked to Arsenal...

**In other news**

* Craig Bellemy left us for Cardiff, although the majority of fans are happy he's heading home a few of us, [well are finding it hard to accept](http://i.imgur.com/TMBUK.gif)

* Charlie Adam has been linked to Everton [for 7m](http://i.imgur.com/uLVEt.gif)

* Another loan to buy offer for Carroll was put in and rejected with Rodgers saying [""Carroll is here to stay""](http://i.imgur.com/j0C4o.gif)

**[Well fuck me...](http://i.imgur.com/6S0Fq.gif)**

**Oussama Assaidi...who the fuck saw this guy coming? not even on my list, never seen his name mentioned, first time Ive ever heard of him....[Never even heard the club he plays for](http://i.imgur.com/dEu0U.gif)**

**As awkward as this is Im keeping this page up..I have faith Sahin will be signed this week-early next week, sorry for the early post, lets hope he signs..or else**

I have seen a lot of bashing of our players on the comments of several threads, obviously the most infamous players to be talked about are Charlie Adam and Stewart Downing (but we know its more than just them). 
I dont think it is very nice for the ""best fans in the world"" to show the kind of disrespect and ungratefulness that we have shown our players. Whatever happened to You'll Never Walk Alone? 
It is true, some players dont have the class or ability to represent the club properly, but to say that ""giving charlie adam to everton is like giving a broken toy to someone you dont like"" is a little low (funny, but low). After all, these players did give it their all, it just wasnt good enough, and thats not their fault.

Let me know what you guys think. If you think Im being a little winy bitch, then I would be happy to listen to those opinions as well

If you look at what he's done when given a fair chance, he's absolutely brilliant. His loan spell at Bolton was one of the most impressive displays by a young player in the last 5-10 years in the Premier League. (8 goals in 12 games.)

He isn't playing now because Torres, for whatever reason, is favoured over him. I don't think it's because Torres is a better player. I think Abramovic wants to show the world how good Torres can be, and benching him for a young lad like Sturridge would be crushing to his morale.

If you even look at his characteristics, he's exactly what we need up front. Quick, relatively strong, very direct in his runs and passing, he can finish and he can beat the offside trap time and time again.

That last point will make him absolutely vital to us. The only proven way to deal with Suarez is to close him down quickly, from the front, and give him no option but to pass the ball reactively. If you give him a yard he'll take a mile, that's what makes him the player we all know and love. Centre halves know this, and push forward to trap Suarez so there's nowhere else to go but backwards. Having a quick player like Sturridge in front of Suarez gives him the option to play the ball into space behind the defensive line. A player as quick as Sturridge can latch onto those balls and put them away. That's the kind of natural, direct, aggressive movement that only a greedy striker can provide, and it's exactly what we need.

Remember this post at the end of this season. If I'm wrong about him, so be it. I'll admit it and move on. But I was right about Torres, and Shelvey, and Sterling, and Suso, and many others.

I've got a really good feeling about this kid. As good as how I felt when we signed Suarez.

Edit: If you disagree with me, tell me why. This is a place for discussion, and so far everyone who I've spoke to who knows about Sturridge as a player rates him highly.

**For**: I'm of the opinion that whilst Shelvey is still young and developing, he simply isn't good enough to don the Liverpool shirt. I'd put him in the same boat as Spearing (remember him? He's still on our list), young and has potential but will never make it to proper Liverpool status.

I remember when people were calling him the next Stevie G in the making (obviously not as good, but similar), I wouldn't want him in our midfield if we're to be challenging for a top 4 spot in the PL; at best I would play him in the Carling Cup matches or early FA Cup matches against the basic teams. 

Would you sell him, loan him, keep him? **Please add a for or against at the start of your post**.

Say what you want about benitez and dalglish, but there is no denying that they organized the defense superbly and made it very very hard for other teams to score against us... 

However, this season has seen us concede goal after goal, many times against weaker teams... Agger is still a monster but what has happened to our wall of a Slovakian from last season? He is not even trusted enough by Rodgers to start over carragher, who showed his age when he made that dreadful backpass against zenit today.. The man has done a lot for our club but he is going to retire and there's nothing that can change that..Sebastian Coates, despite being an established international for Uruguay, is also not trusted enough to even sit on the bench... Youngsters such as Kelly and Wisdom are also not good enough for a starting place yet.. How many times this season have we seen our beloved side waste a 1 or 2 goals lead due to amateurish defensive errors.. 

We've got Suarez and Sturridge who can score bags of goals, a rejuvenated Henderson and a Stevie G who's firing on all cylinders... Enrique and Johnson are unbeatable when in-form and reina, despite still making a few mistakes here and there, cannot be blamed for the many poor passes and lapses in concentration which led to many of the goals we've conceded... What is now missing from a potential champions-league side is a world-class defensive Titan... A mats Hummels, Giorgio chiellini, Dante, thiago silva or Sergio Ramos would lead us right to that elusive fourth-place spot but there is no way they'd even consider leaving their current teams, who are all better than us.. In my opinion, the best option for us would be Angelo ogbonna.. 

Ogbonna is a monster of a defender who is an amazingly clean tackler... Standing at 6'2 and weighing 86 kg, he's strong enough to challenge any attacker, yet is deceptively quick and can chase down speedy strikers with ease... At 24 and with 150 caps under his belt he has that perfect balance of youth and experience.. He's considered the best young defender in Italy and is the first Torino player to play for the Italian national team since 2007.. Given Italy's emphasis on experience it is a great achievement for a 24 year old to have 5 international caps for them.. Playing for a non-champions league side like Torino means that his price tag wouldn't be astronomical, probably around £10-14 million, which would be a steal for someone of his talent.. An added bonus is that his physicality and tackling ability would see him fit seamlessly into the premier league so there wouldn't be much of a transitional period..

All I know is that we badly need a new, world-class CB, and I think ogbonna is the best option for us.. Thanks for reading, YNWA",,False,self,t5_2qn0o,False,,lfc68,True,t3_18zep1,http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/18zep1/forget_all_the_other_positions_a_worldclass_cb/,

Now what if I told you Clint Dempsey, who was long linked to us for WEEKS and TURNED DOWN a 7 million pound bid from Villa, specifically saying he wanted to go to Liverpool is [NOW at Spurs with a transfer about to be settled?](http://i.imgur.com/bSfgr.gif)

I dont know about you, but Id say [Somebody fucked up here..](http://i.imgur.com/iqXO2.gif)

If things weren't bad enough, rumours started forming that Liverpool were going to talk to, believe it or not...[Michael Owen](http://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/2011/3/6/12b07451-a741-4f76-a3b3-329b4197f988.gif)

It was no secret Liverpool needed a goal scorer so in true LFC fashion we waited too long and then to put in a cheeky bid of only £4 million, [for the FOURTH highest goal scorer last season](http://i.imgur.com/jHMVR.gif)

and now with Carroll gone, [were are pretty much lacking in depth up front...again](http://i.imgur.com/W1XbQ.jpg)

Our goal scoring needs now [rest on Borini](http://i.imgur.com/qWCSl.gif)

I don't know about you, but I'm *pretty* pissed off...[Things could be worse but they are not exactly better, so heres to the new season!](http://i.imgur.com/awttd.gif)

**Honest Note:**

We should hope for the best and Im sure we'll be alright but having a natural Goal scorer who does and can score would have made life for us SO much easier, we now have to rely on young guys lets hope they can surprise everyone and do it. 

-----------------------------------------------

**The FINAL Transfer List:**

------------------------------------------------

*Joe Allen* - Proof that Gerrard and Alonso were more than friends, this love child is a true passing **MACHINE**, so early in but already [well on his way to becoming a star.](http://i.imgur.com/QHEeU.gif)

*Borini* - You..you have a LOT of fucking good work to do my son..

*Sahin* - Not yet graced the field in red but has been tipped to be one of the future best players in the world..we'll be the judges of that! [Still though..Sahin](http://i.imgur.com/k815a.gif)

*Assaidi* - What can I say, who the fuck saw this guy coming? [With a name no Scouser can dream of saying](http://i.imgur.com/JVPTw.gif), we put our faith in BR

---------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------

**Speculation Fails**

*Theo Walcott* - *Sigh...*

*Clint 'should be a Liverpool player' Dempsey* - [Signed for Spurs..](http://i.imgur.com/2sakf.jpg)

*Daniel Sturridge* - Stayed at Chelsea, mad that we gave them a faulty Torres kept young Daniel away

*Christian Tello* -  Stayed at Barca, should leave next season if he doesn't get more first team football.

-------------------------------------------------

**Final Goodbye**

Well, this is it.

In a Crazy window full of ups and downs, we may not have got that prized striker we all dreamed of but we can take away certain positive points. 

we managed to keep our prized centre backs from leaving, [this is even more impressive when you know some of the bids exceeded £25m](http://i.imgur.com/AhWNt.gif)

Agger, desperate to stay at LFC got YNWA tattooed on his knuckles, effectively ending any chance of selling him, [did Dagger care?](http://i.imgur.com/LOwum.gif)

Our Midfielder got the biggest influx of players with enough talent, skill and potential to take us to a level the likes of which we have not seen since the days of [Gerrard, Alonso and Mascherano played](http://i.imgur.com/VntoZ.gif)

We will all remember that feeling of [watching Raheem Sterling play for the first time](http://i.imgur.com/nxNy5.gif)

and dont be mad that we didnt sign any more players, because if Raheem can do it [imagine all the potential there is in the youth team waiting for their chance](http://i.imgur.com/mCk1W.gif)
