As a moderator you sometimes have to make controversial decisions that will make some people dislike you for a little while, but that is the job I signed up for.

Lately the front page has seen a large influx of post like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/199iu6/nostalgia/). I know this will probably upset a lot of people but the game has been out for a week now, so I think it's time we stop with the countless ""look at this thing that was in runescape in 2007 and now it's back in runescape 2007"" post.

We do not want this subreddit to become /r/gaming, where it is infested with low effort pointless post that do not encourage discussion. This is main reason we do not allow memes.

If you do not agree with this, that is fine, but please upvote anyways so everyone can see it. Thank you.

She's really awesome and hangs out with me while I play runescape and sometimes even takes the wheel while i take a break to go get food for us, or take a shower. These are two conversations that I've found humorous during our time scaping together. 

During this first one, she was going to help my craft some airs, so I was guiding her from the bank to the altar.

Me: okay yeah just a little farther south, use the talisman on that big rock

her: wtf where are we

me: okay just click on the big rock again

her: alright now where do I go?

me: lather rinse repeat

her:....you've got to be fucking kidding me

When this second one happened, we were watching documentaries on one monitor, while I smith iron knives on the other.

her: what are you doing now?

me: making 5k iron knives

her: you're making FIVE THOUSAND!?

me: yeah but it's not bad at all because 1 iron bar makes 5 knives.

her: so you're turning ONE THOUSAND iron into knives? Why don't you just FUCKING KILL YOURSELF.

me: there's only 300 left don't worry.

her: you did SEVEN HUNDRED already, and you HAVEN'T FUCKING KILLED YOURSELF? wow.

Thanks if you took the time to read these, they made me laugh.

I hope you find some of these useful/interesting.

***Because this is a self-post, please upvote this so it gets more attention. I'd like to get lots of fresh ideas from you guys to add.***
  
**Combat**

* [**Here's the best max hit calculator for OSRS**](http://web.archive.org/web/20080601230937/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=max_hit_calc.htm)

* Using Hawk Eye instead of Eagle Eye when training range is much more cost efficient as it drains twice as slowly and gives only 2/3 less bonuses.

* Use a monkey skip task to train on the Monkey Guards at Ape Atoll.  You get the Black Mask's bonuses as well as a free source of prayer.

* Broad arrows (55 slayer) are very cost-efficient ammo (they have a ranged strength between mithril and adamant arrows).  Buy a few hundred per world (at any slayer master) and then hop.

* The best way to kill Green Dragons is by using the Carrallangar teleport (84 magic) to the Graveyard of Shadows and running north.  Once you have a full inventory, use a Glory to Edgeville or run a little south to 20 Wilderness and teleport to Castle Wars. You can setup a cannon and leave it constantly running because of how short the travel time is.  You will use a lot of run energy collecting the bones/hides, so bring a few (super) energy potions.

* The best place to kill trolls for a slayer task is the Ice Trolls north of Jatiszo.  You should pray melee and wear a Fremennik round shield to reduce the damage from the female thrower trolls.  The drops often cover the cost of cannonballs, so use a cannon (set it up a little west of where the Fremennik guards spawn).  When you run out of food/get a full inv. of drops, run back to the Jatiszo bank (leave your cannon running - the distance is so short it won't matter).

* If you're doing a Dagannoth task with low defense, bring noted food and some coins.  You can sell your noted food to the general store on the second floor of the lighthouse and buy it back without losing much time.  This made the task for me, as a berserker pure, very do-able, even while using a cannon.

* When using a long-range attack (range/magic) on a NPC from the north (the monster being south of you), while outside of its ""wander range,"" the monster won't ""back track,"" but will instead wander around normally without immediately drawing you back into its range.  This is useful when training range/magic at a location without safespots (Green Dragons, for example).

* Monk's robes give the same prayer bonus as Initiate platebody and legs.

* The Warrior ring is a very underrated item.  It provides +4 slash attack and defense bonus while the Berserker ring provides +4 strength and crush defense. However, it's **over 10 times cheaper** than the Berserker ring and is just as ideal when training with a slash weapon anyway (accuracy is as important as strength).





**Skillling**

* Smithing can be trained quickly while making a little profit by making unfinished bolts.  Make mithril at level 54 and adamant at level 73.

* Adding feathers to your unfinished bolts is *extremely* quick and overlooked fletching xp. Set up mouse keys so you can quickly switch between two inv. spaces, put a weighted object on your ""ctrl"" button to keep it down, and click your mouse as you cycle between two numbers on your num pad. Keep in mind, you can feather bolts just about anywhere in the game while doing anything as long as you have 3 open inv. spaces.

* The Spellbook Swap spell (96 magic) on the lunar spellbook is extremely underrated.  It allows you to complete full herb runs (all 5 patches) on the lunar spellbook.  Use it to switch to the standard spellbook, and teleport to Trollheim.  Then finish your run with the Catherby Teleport spell, the Fishing Guild Teleport spell for the Ardougne patch, an Ectophial, and a Glory teleport (or a Falador teletab if you want to do your tree on the way) to the Draynor patch.

* Using (super) energy potions while training agility is **well worth** your time. [This comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/1ia9ot/one_more_to_go/cb3cwpe) explains that if you can make ~200k gp per hour, then the amount of time super energies save you is worth it.  You can also keep the empty vials and re-fill them to minimize your losses.

* Baskets of strawberries are the best single inv. space healing item other than purple sweets (6 hp per strawberry, 5 strawberries per basket, 30 hp in total).  They are great for agility training because they weigh less than most foods and heal a lot in small increments (this ideal because you take less damage failing obstacles when your hp is lower).

* The Plank-Make spell (86 magic) is an effective way to train magic. You can buy mahogany logs (or collect them from Kingdom Management) and convert them to mahogany planks for a little profit.  This is very click-intensive but it's faster xp than alching.




**Getting Around**

* [**This is the best fairy ring map for OSRS**](http://images.wikia.com/runescape/images/archive/3/38/20111120221912!Fairy_ring_map.png)

* [**A more detailed map**](http://i.imgur.com/R90x1Gz.jpg)

* The quickest way to access the fairy rings is by using the Kharyll teleport (66 magic) to Canifis and running west.  It's useful to have a teleport room in your house with a Kharyll portal so you can do this on any spellbook.

* The quickest way to access the spirit trees (without having a spirit tree patch) is teleporting to castle wars and using a magic log to fly to the Tree Gnome Stronghold.  This requires the completion of Enlightened Journey and 60 firemaking.

* The quickest way(s) to access the charter ship system is by using either the Khazard teleport (78 magic) or the Catherby teleport (87 magic), both of which are on the lunar spellbook.

* You can reduce the cost of charter ships by taking an indirect route to your destination instead of traveling directly there (like a layover flight).

* The quickest way to access the Wilderness obelisks is using the Ghorrock Teleport (96 magic) on the ancient spellbook.  It puts you right next to the obelisk in 44 wilderness near the Ice Plateau.  This is useful when doing level 3 clues.

* You can get a free teleport from the Shantay Pass to Port Sarim by threatening to kill Shantay and refusing to pay up in the jail cell.  You'll end up in the Port Sarim jail.

* The quickest way to switch to the Lunar spellbook (other than getting teleothered by another player - W2 Edgeville is the best place to find someone for this, but you'll have to pay) is using fairy ring code **CIP** to Miscellania, running south to the sailor, then going to the adjacent dock where Lokar Searunner is in Rellekka (**don't forget your seal of passage**). This method is also good when you need to switch from the Ancient spellbook to the normal spellbook because it's faster than going to the ancient pyramid.

* High Alching while you run lowers the rate at which your run energy drains.





**NPCs/Stores**

* You can buy the same drinks found in the Falador pub in the Games Room in multiples of 10.  This is useful for obtaining Wizard Mind Bombs.

* When buying runes in the Magic Guild, buy the battlestaves as well.  There's a stock of 5, and you can resell them to players for a profit of 1k ea, meaning you make 5k per world.

* The best way to stock up on vials and eyes of newts is by using a normal log on the balloon system near Castle Wars and going to Taverly.  Then run west to the shop, buy a full inv, and tele back to CW. You can bring a hatchet and cut the logs for the balloon ride as you go.

* Opals, jades, and red topazes are far from useless items.  Sell the cut versions to the trader in the center of the Tai Bwo Wannai activity to collect trading sticks (sell 10 of each gem per world to maximize your cost-efficiency) and then purchase Red Topaz Machetes.  They sell fairly quickly at 150k ea on Zybez.  This is actually a great money-making method with low requirements (Jungle Potion).  If you've completed Shilo Village, you can mine these gems in the gem mine.

* Jekyll will give you different potions for having different herbs in your inventory. In exchange for a cadantine, he will give you a super restore.



**Player Interaction**

* When buying/selling less common items on Zybez (mahogany planks, for example), you can easily manipulate the prices more than with commonly traded items. When there is little competition for an item, people will pay more/sell for less to save time.  In other words, focus less on the trade prices and more on the times at which the offers were created.

* Press tab to quick reply to the last message sent or received (you have to have that person added, though).


**Other**

* Entering and leaving a portal at Castle Wars will restore your health and prayer.

* When running around under the threat of NPC and player attacks when you have no intention of fighting back (like training rcing in the abyss or scoring a flag in Castle Wars), set your attack style to defensive.  You gain an invisible +3 levels to your defense skill.

* The Zybez Price Guide lists the high and low alchemy values of all items.  Use this when choosing items to alch. (Hint: yew longs are *far* from the most ideal item).

* If you find yourself running out of bank space, consider putting a costume room in your POH (42 construction).  You can then buy mahogany furniture flatpacks for all of the hotspots in the room off of higher-level construction players and install them without needing the required construction level to make them. You can store all types of armor sets, clothes, and treasure trails items.

* Type ""::toggleroof"" in chat without quotes to remove roofs, allowing you to click inside banks a lot easier.

It is currently complete up until Dragon Slayer. It covers what items to get for which quest whilst in an area and should be fastest way to complete a bulk of quests. 

Here's is the link: [2007QuestGuide](http://pastebin.com/gE97bXVG). 

Feel free to add my RSN: Questeer, for anyone going for an early quest cape!

UPDATE: Guide is complete all the way up to Dragon Slayer. Also can be used by pures. Shouldn't have any major errors. 

Waterfall can be done at any time if you're rushing with a group, but I still recommend waiting till later since it's not a high priority quest if you want to get a bulk of them done.

------------
The argument for some users is that if they're not botting, they are falling behind in the game, because everybody else is botting. Another argument is that the game is a lot more fun at higher levels. Granted, Pking and staking is a lot more intense, challenging and enjoyable when you've got good stats and decent gear, but that defeats the purpose of the game.
And then we have some people who bot just because it's openly available to them, and it either makes them some cash in real life or they like seeing all those stats at 99.

All of these mindsets, whether you're doing it to catch up, have fun, or make a profit from real world trading, cuts the life expectancy of this game in half. By botting, you are not only ruining the game for yourself in the longterm, but the entire playerbase. 


It's been proven time and time again with countless other MMO/MMORPG games. Bots are released, people use them casually and then eventually there are more bots playing than actual people. 


I just had an hour long chat with two fellows regarding bots and RWT, and they said the game is a lot more enjoyable when your stats are high and you've got a lot of cash for good gear (their excuse for botting). I understand this argument completely, but you're playing the wrong game if you want to be spoon fed everything. In 2007 Runescape, you work hard for what you get - just like in real life. If you don't like it, go play on the EOC servers, another private server, or better yet, a different game. 


I'm writing this post in hopes people will say NO to bots, even if it gives you a disadvantage. Even if you are opposed to bots but still use them just to be on par, you are helping destroy the game. You create a demand for the creation of bots every time you visit a botting site/download a bot and/or real world trade.  If you want this game to survive, stop botting, report every bot you see, and spread the word that botting WILL destroy this game. 

Please please please, even if you're one of those people using a bot and telling yourself ""it's such a small thing, nothing will happen"", everybody begins to get that mindset and suddenly we're playing EOCscape again, where you can't go a single second w/o hearing a bot screaming ""SELLING RS GOLD"". 

You CAN make a difference! Just because you don't see it now doesn't mean it's not working.

Every time I just sit down and play the damn game, I find myself absolutely loving it. 

But there is always something that causes me to lose interest - the absolute disparity that comes with getting really good. This subreddit is particularly bad for me - I see posts with people getting Dragon gear within the week of launch, and 99's soon after. Hell, on the front page right now some dude has more 2007Scape money than I've *ever* had on Runescape - something like 101M. In fact, if he sold that to one of those gold sites, he'd have more than $1000 in his pocket of real money. Don't get me wrong - these people deserve all the kudos in the world, because it's a really big achievement, but god damn if it doesn't make me feel inadequate. In fact, I very rarely come on this sub simply because I'm happier in ignorance of everything that I'm not able to do.

It appears that whilst many of us jubilantly celebrated the manual banning of a large number of bots, there were a number of innocent victims caught in the melee.

If you were banned and weren't and have never used a botting program then please heed the following advice. If you were botting and got pissed that you got caught then don't bother; you ran the risk, you lost.

* Email -  accounthelp@jagex.com
* Send a POLITE, well written email fully explaining the situation. Refrain from being openly offensive, by all means express your frustration but do so in an articulate manner. The person at the other end of the email didn't ban you, and no-one had intentions of banning accounts that have done nothing wrong.
* Include the following account details;  Your username, associated account email address, any billing receipts that you have from Jagex. This helps verify that you are the owner of the account, do not send your password.
* You can also consider sending a letter to their HQ, the postal address can be found on the website.

Whilst the situation is beyond frustrating I cannot stress enough how much a polite and refrained message will make the process of regaining your account much faster and less painful.

Might I also suggest that ONE of you posts a polite, well constructed, post on the 07scape forums and drop a link in the comments - others with the same problem can bump this.   (Please verify the website you login to IS the official forums and not a phishing link)

Finally, if you wish; post your story and screenshots as a reply to this post, instead of creating a new thread.

I sincerely hope the Mods read this post and take action to rectify any mistakes made when removing bots.  


Best of luck guys - keep us up to date with any progress.

Zelden

You borrow them an item to complete a clue and others borrow you items.

Of course this is completely a trust thing and I do not expect anyone to start borrowing out rune legs, I mean simple things like an addy sq shield or green gnome robe top, things you don't generally have as lower or higher levels. 

You borrow the items you run the risk, don't borrow items you would ever risk losing as there are desperate people. Informing me of scammers or stealers will result in an instakick whenever they enter the clan chat.

I crashed on Crandor, ran to Elvarg and a guy using magic was already in there trying to kill the dragon.  He seemed to be getting hit for pretty damn high, regular 9s and 10s and his heal rate just wasn't good enough.  After about a minute of fighting he finally died, dropping 200 air runes, 90 mind runes, amulet of accuracy and a whole load of food (mostly stews and salmon).  Immediately I ran in to kill Elvarg.

After using excalibur for the defence boost (shouting ""For Camelot!"" running into a dragon fight is rather fun) I swung the sword and hit 0.  I kept having bad hits and Elvarg was ripping me to shreds.  I started thinking I was ill prepared, 5 slots of my inventory were using edible seaweed which heals 4 (I thought it healed 10+).  I then landed a 3 and Elvarg died - the guy was one successful hit from killing her.  I ripped offer her head and claimed the quest.

RIP to the mage in the light green robes.  We do not know your name, but we salute you.  We also wear your amulet from time to time.",,False,self,t5_2wbww,1361983701.0,,greenegg,True,t3_19bi60,http://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/19bi60/an_epitaph_for_the_mage_that_died_bravely/,

I know and understand that it was bad for the economy and made RS feel single player because it make player interaction unnecessary. Now, here is my idea:

-It would be in the same place as the GE is in EoC (so it's easy to find)

-The main purpose of it is to have a system like the GE: Request a trade to buy or sell item(s). However, the GE would not hold the items for you and automatically sell them: It would simply say ""JoeBob: Selling 28 Cowhide: 20GP each"" and a player could read this after searching ""Cowhide"". They would then contact JoeBob asking to buy the Cowhide.

-The prices would be completely user determined.

-The message would *not* be custom. It would follow a certain form: &lt;Username&gt; is &lt;Selling/Buying&gt; &lt;Amount&gt; &lt;Item&gt; for &lt;Price Each&gt;.

1364525159.0,69,self.2007scape,1b7wvj,Tips to be successful,SuperCrayon,80,11,80,http://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/1b7wvj/tips_to_be_successful/,"Hey I'm here to give some people a few tips that will help them in this game.

Some info on my account:
I have a total level of 1020.
My 2 highest stats are 80 hunter and 65 smiting. (both ranked in the top 1000)
I have 70 quest points.
I have around a 15m bank value.
I play around 3.5 hours a day.

I know my stats aren't extremely impressive but I still feel these tips will help a lot of you.

1- Do Throne of Miscelinia and Royal trouble, This gives u the ability to manage you own kingdom, making you 1.5m profit a week (78m a year) and very little work is required. This is by far the most helpful thing in the game.

2- Get in the habit of doing regular farm runs. 32 farming is required for ranarr weeds and 38 farming is required for toadflax seeds. Ranarr seeds make slightly more profit, but if you don't have a lot of cash it can be annoying to constantly be trying to sell your ranarr weeds to buy new seeds. Toadflax still make a lot of profit and I've been able to buy several hundred of them for 2kea, meaning I don't have to worry about constantly buying seeds. Planting Limpwart seeds is also good as they cost 1.5kea and you get 3 limpwart roots which you can sell for 2kea.
Doing ghost ahoy is helpful to get the ectophile to teleport to the canafis farming patch. (you can also use the fairy wings)

Doing my big arms adventure is another helpful quest that allows you to use a disease free farming patch, because your herbs will never die I recommend if you are farming toadflax seeds that you bring atleast 1 ranarr seed for this patch.

You can do a herb run every 1.5 hours, and with access to all 5 patches you will make roughly 100k per run. A herb runs takes about 5 minutes. 




3- Picking a skill and sticking with it for a while will be very beneficial, most skills don't make much money between lvl's 1-69, but above that they do. If you have a lot of mid level skills and no high level skills you will likely find it very hard to make money.




4- Make your own jewellery. This one isn't very important but I constantly see people buying a dueling ring for 5k in some random bank. I've gotten so many gems from random events (and im sure you have also) that I have enough rings of dueling, rings of forging, games necklace's that i'll never need to buy one again.




5- Don't sit around in banks doing nothing.




6- Avoid things like nat running. Running nature runes is okay if you need some start up cash but don't rely on it as you long term source of income as you get no xp from it and it would be much more helpful to put in the time yourself and get 44 rc to craft your own nats.Things like picking flax also fall under this category.



7- Always check the second trade screen!!!!!!(it's so simple just read).



These are the few tips I could think of, I'm sure some of you have more and PLEASE feel free to add them as they will likely help someone else out. I'm also sure some of you may disagree with what I'm saying but I think it will help many of you.

1363890445.0,65,self.2007scape,1aqwe3,The next content poll - Presenting both arguments so you don't have to,ZeldenGM,68,3,90,http://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/1aqwe3/the_next_content_poll_presenting_both_arguments/,"Today Jagex announced the planned set of questions for the next [content poll.](http://services.runescape.com/m=rswiki/en/DevBlog:First_Old_School_RuneScape_Content_Poll#F2P_worlds_for_PKers) This post will aim to summarise these questions, what this means for you as a player, and reasons why players may vote for or against each point. This post will aim to be as impartial as possible and shall strive not to advocate any of you to vote for either point. Please note that comments made in italics are *possible* pros and cons and are not in any way based on firm fact.

**Discussion** of these polls should be conducted with **respect for other players opinions** and with consideration to all members of the community.

Now without further ado..

* **Improved routefinding**
This will aim to address issues such as 'cant reach that' when clicking on interactable objects from a distance (for example agility shortcuts) as well as route-finding in combat to prevent 'dancing around.'

**Pros:** Smoother gameplay


**Cons:** *Possibly* improves the ability of bots to interact with the game.

* **Themed Worlds** 
This will mark certain worlds for certain activities based on forum posts on the old-school forums. For example world 2 being marked as a trade world.

**Pros:** Easier to find groups for team-based objectives. Easier to trade/run runes, etc 

**Cons:** ""Forces"" people to use certain worlds. Potentially increases overpopulation of certain servers.

* **Stop agility bottlenecks**
This patch will prevent messages such as 'this is currently in use' with relation to agility obstacles - For example the two pipes in the gnome agility course.

**Pros:** Makes agility experience smoother. Prevents queues on busy worlds. Gives fair platform for players regardless of connection speeds.

**Cons:** Graphical glitches with players overlapping. 

* **Mouse Camera**
This patch will introduce the ability to rotate and change the in-game camera angle by holding down the mouse buttons

**Pros:** Gives an alternative option to change camera angle which may suit some players

**Cons:** None?

* **Login Queues**
This feature will place players in a queue when trying to enter a world that is currently full instead of giving the message 'this server is full, please try another server'

**Pros:** *Possibly* makes connecting to popular worlds easier, particularly for people with slower connections. Gives players a sense of timescale when trying to enter a populated world.

**Cons:** Creates transparency in how overcrowded some worlds are which *may* lead to backlash due to high queue timers.
Encourages players to wait for a single server as opposed to making use of emptier ones, which in turn aggravates the overcrowding issue. - *For example it's possible that players may choose to wait to enter world 1 to trade instead of using other, less crowded trade worlds.*

* **F2P PvP Worlds.**
This question has returned to the poll after a high vote base on the last set of polls, but not a high enough vote to result in it being implemented. As a result [Jagex have clarified what exactly this feature entails](http://services.runescape.com/m=rswiki/en/DevBlog:First_Old_School_RuneScape_Content_Poll#F2P_worlds_for_PKers)

**Pros:** Grants players that want the F2P PvP experience the platform to do so, which would be otherwise unavailable.
Provides a long-term economy for non-member items such as rune armour, green dragonhide, lobsters and swordfish, etc
Offers great diversity of PvP options

**Cons:** *Arguably* splits the community and *arguably* reduces the size of the current pvp playerbase on members worlds.
Players which have already lvl'd skills on the basis that there wouldn't be F2P PvP feel 'cheated'


**Summary**

This summarises the next poll and possible pros and cons for each question. Please remember that the pros and cons put forward here are *suggestions* and **not** set in stone facts. Almost all of these points can be argued either way, so please respect the position of both sides when **discussing** these points.

Also if a feature doesn't interest you, please abstain from voting or vote for the more popular option. If you're not personally affected then please do not ruin the fun for people with a vested interest in these features.

This post will remain in the sidebar for quick-reference so please direct all discussion relating to the polls here. ",,False,self,t5_2wbww,False,,forummod,True,t3_1aqwe3,http://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/1aqwe3/the_next_content_poll_presenting_both_arguments/,moderator

**CC is Old Ralvn**

**It will be on World 1 West Varrock Bank (so try to be early). One team (Team Alpha) will be ready to drop at 3 PM Eastern Time and the other team (Team Omega) 8 PM Eastern time, Monday April 1st. I will be distributing Cabbages 30 minutes before the event, so meet me in West Varrock Bank at 1:30 PM Eastern Time if you can make it. I will be part of Team Alpha.**

*I won't be recording this event. If you'd like to, feel free.*

**Team Alpha:** 3 PM eastern time

**Team Omega:** 8 PM eastern time

[HERE IS A TIME ZONE CONVERTER TO HELP YOU](http://www.timezoneconverter.com/cgi-bin/tzc.tzc)

I am bringing 500 cabbages to distribute to team Alpha personally, then giving 500 to someone who can distribute to team Omega later on.

**Everyone who is attending please add me. My RSN: Old Ralvn ----- I am Eastern time US.**

I made a small album on how to pick cabbage more efficiently. Credit for the idea goes to CluelessAtLife. It would really help me out if you brought some of your own because picking 1k cabbage is no fun I can promise. Sacks can fill with 10 cabbages by the way.

I make 30$ an hour working at a grocery store in Norway, I live at home, with no expenses, my mom even pays me to stay home to finish high school, I'm 19.

I have always considered myself lucky to be born in Norway, and I always help people out. I never donate to charities, as I feel it's just a waste, usually 90% of what you give goes to some asshole that wants a swimming-pool in his backyard.

However, since I got my job last year, I've always helped friends I met online, donated to kickstart projects and stuff like that.

I can't wait for the 07 servers, and I want them to turn out as good as possible. In the light of this, I'm going to pay some of you guys' membership fees.

I wanna do it through the referral system, as that only costs 2$.   

I know some of you might make duplicate accounts and ""scam"" me, but please don't do that. Have some decency. You're not scamming me, as I get the votes anyway. You're scamming the community, which you were complaining about just a second ago.


Go to the recruit a friend program, and recruit one of these:

~~torkelrs@gmail.com~~

~~torkelrs1@gmail.com~~

~~rstorkel@live.com~~

~~rstorkel@yahoo.no~~

~~rstorkel1@yahoo.no~~

~~rstorkel2@yahoo.no~~

~~rstorkel3@yahoo.no~~

~~rstorkel4@yahoo.no~~

~~rstorkel5@yahoo.no~~

~~ffsowns1@live.com~~

I have accepted referrals now, but have to wait until Sunday or Monday to pay. Waiting for the 75% discount emails.  
The response was overwhelming, sorry to those that couldn't get one this time, I don't have time to make more e-mails atm, I'll most likely do this again in the coming days.


EDIT 18/02:

Im sorry guys, but they changed it. You can no longer buy membership for 2$.  
For us norwegians, the price is 50NOK (9 USD) for one sub. I have now bought membership on:

torkelrs@gmail.com  
torkelrs1@gmail.com  
rstorkel@yahoo.no  
rstorkel1@yahoo.no
  
Spent 36$

This sucks.. Was looking forward to buying membership to loads of people, but I really don't think it's worth it when the price is this high.

I was just chopping yews, talking to the guy next to me about how the bot on the other yew tree was about to get owned by the sandwich lady. Next thing I know I'm disconnected and perma banned for two counts of Macroing (gold farming).

This is quite strange considering that I have never once used a macro in all the years I've played runescape (used to play back in the old days and came back for 07scape). What's even weirder is that I usually talk to the people around me while I'm skilling, and what's more is that I'm friendly. I like the social aspect of the game. I don't have any clue why someone would report me. Believe me, I hate bots as much as the next guy and report them every time I see them. 

Has this kind of mistake ever happened to anyone else? Did you get your account access back? I can't help but feel a bit spited because of this. 

**EDIT**: This, is listed under the rules of conduct FAQ

""**Will I be able to appeal a ban I was given for macroing?**

*Under most circumstances, you will be able to appeal any bans you have been given.*""

I can only hope they will review the evidence and see I am very active in chat and have never used any kind of macroing.  

**EDIT 2**:

Apparently this is happening to more people than just me, which is both a good thing (sorry guys!) and a bad thing. It seems everyone who has been banned wrongfully happened to be chopping yews at the time and was disconnected with a perma ban around the same time. Upvote this post please so others can see they are not alone in this injustice.

1362061715.0,52,self.2007scape,19ea3d,[GUIDE] Monkey Madness with low HP and &lt;43 prayer? Here's how you do it!,YOUR_VERY_STUPID,59,7,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/19ea3d/guide_monkey_madness_with_low_hp_and_43_prayer/,"This piece of shit quest is unfun and tedious and it took me a solid four hours to do it last night, so I'm hoping to spare people from some of my pain and share my lessons. It's not really different from doing it with 43 prayer, but 43 prayer has a much higher margin of error, so this is basically a specific guide that will work either with or without protect prayers. I found that the guides I used lacked in details about some of this, and I died when they didn't fully explain things. So this is just a compilation of all the information that would have saved my ass from dying thrice getting the greegree!

There are a few hard bits to survive.

The first irritating bit is the animals. Scorpions kept hitting 14s on me. Fuck scorpions.

To survive these, you'll need to simply not waste time. Don't be standing around in the bushes afk reading a quest guide. Know where you need to go, and if you have to check a guide, log out while you do it. Pretty obvious, but it needs to be said.

Secondly, The Maze of Suck as I just christened it five seconds ago is named that because it ***FUCKING SUCKS DICKS.*** Minimize your weight- you don't really need armor here, you just need to be able to run. Bring  food (i used about 150 lobbies over the course of the quest), a super anti (they respawn in goblin village near observatory, southernmost building), the items you need (grabbing spares really couldn't hurt at all, going through this extra times is really fucking annoying), and 4-5 four-dose energy potions. You should be able just to run straight through while continuously chugging potions and eating food.

The part of the quest I had most difficulty with was getting through the temple to make the amulet. I eventually figured it out. Firstly, you have to run through the temple to the west set of stairs to the north. Go up them. There's an NPC gorilla up there that I didn't really care about- he didn't maul me and I didn't talk to him. The down staircase only takes you to about four squares away from the up staircase, but it's nice to reset aggro and have a safe spot up there.

Then you'll need to run to the northeast corner- don't be scared of the monkeys, even though they'll fuck you up. The northeast corner has, around the back of some pit of fire or something, a nice safe spot. Around the back of that pit of fire you can't be touched. Go south a little, staying within the safe zone, and watch the trapdoor and the gorillas guarding it.

These gorillas are the reason this is so difficult and you can't just run through. They'll block you completely if you try to move through them, and it's really easy to get into a situation where three of them surround you, mauling you, and there are 0 squares you can move to. This is what we're avoiding.

You have complete vision of these gorillas, and they move back and forth a little. See the pattern in that and wait until one moves away from the trapdoor, then immediately run and go down it. If you do this right, you'll end up right next to a bunch of zombie monkeys trying to forcibly penetrate you with skeleton bananas or whatever the hell they hit you with. Use the monkey bar on the weird firey shit to the east, and tele out of there.

The boss fight was actually way shorter and less painful than those two awful areas. I simply three itemed it. If you get one-shot by the demon, you respawn in lumbridge, put the sigil on again, and try again. The demon can't hit you if you run across one of those bamboo bridges. Get over there and if you haven't died, cheer a little, pull the demon to where all the gnomes are and where you can see a tiny corner of its health bar, and go make a sandwich or something. Come back in 5 minute and you'll see that the demon has an almost entirely red bar- you just need to go hit it once. If it kills you as you kill it, that's fine- you get completion anyway. Just repeat this and it won't take too long to beat the demon.

Also- a word of advice, don't lose that sigil or you'll have to go through the maze all over again. Additionally, don't teleport while wielding the greegree with a full inventory, or you will lose it and have to make another one.

Good luck and enjoy what's pretty much the best weapon in the game!  ",,False,self,t5_2wbww,False,,hunter,True,t3_19ea3d,http://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/19ea3d/guide_monkey_madness_with_low_hp_and_43_prayer/,

I was fletching at Varrock West bank and talking to my friend. He logged out without saying goodbye or anything which i though was really strange. I saw him log into another world and then immediately go off. luckily i saw which world it was and turned my pm off and hopped.

I logged into the world and couldn't see him anywhere, but i saw my other friend (well i thought he was a friend -.-) run out of the bank and up a ladder. I knew something was up but wasn't sure what.

I went up the ladder and straight away realized what was going on. I stood on top of him as items started appearing on the ground. He had hacked my other friend and was drop trading his items!

An extra sense of adventure. They generate memories. I'll never forget being scammed so many times as a noob, or the times I have been scammed and out of community the person would just give me my items back because they felt bad. I once made best friends with someone who tried to scam me. And even now, when a really genius scam gets pulled on me, I can't help but sick back and commend them with an applause.

And gambling, well... I can't help but feel like a lot of people resent gamblers/hosters for the fact that they're missing out on all the money they're making as in hosts, or the money gamblers are winning. The thing is, gambling is an option. You can choose to not participate in it. It's just like real life, some people might get lucky and get ahead by gambing, some people may make a living out of other people gambling. Regardless, I feel like everyone should stop whining about it so much, requesting for so many updates for it's removal.

TLDR: All these things add dimension and a bigger sense of adventure to the game, at least for me. In a way, these things are what I miss about Old R.S.

First we want to thank everyone who has posted and subscribed thus far.  Our reddit community has been growing faster than I could've imagined.  I can't believe old runescape is back, this has been an extremely exciting last week.  I'm greatly looking forward to seeing you all in game, and at upcoming events.  Speaking of events, we will be holding our first next friday the 28th!  We're open to suggestions, but I'm thinking something along the lines of a raffle, contest or pvp event.  We really want to make this the place to be, and with your help I truly believe this reddit will be something special.   

___________________________________________________________________


A few ideas we've had so far:

Weekly events/contests

Possible online Radio (something to jam out to while playing RS)

Weekly Youtube videos

Group questing/boss fights

Special guide threads and/or links to well known guide sites

Website -  I own the url runescape2007.com.  We are thinking of having a video 
of the day, radio, guides and link to the reddit on there.  

Featured Player of the week - Give a random poster each week a highlighted thread.  Have an about me and accomplishments in game so far.  

Please note:  This is just a small list of ideas we have come up with in a short amount of time.  I believe the possibilities are endless!


____________________________________________________________________


Again, thanks to everyone who are already making this community great.  We will do our best to stay on track and deliver the things you, the community, want.

Just felt like sharing a thought...

I have finals in a month. I should study. I should ""grind"", as you may say. And after 7-8 years of playing Runescape, watching it grow as I matured myself, and experiencing the current 07RS -- I've learned that efficiency is the key. I never really gotten a 99 even after 8 years of Runescape because I just did whatever I felt like, but coming back to 07RS has taught me to approach this game efficiently, through questing, through sticking to a skill to train, through the simple idea of NO EXP WASTE.

And now that my finals are in 1 month... I felt that this spirit really resonated with me a learner. I'd grind my textbooks and study like a badass because I can't afford to lose any XP. Every second of not doing anything is losing XP. Every moment I miss is an opportunity I've shattered. And slowly it accumulates to once big chunk of opportunity cost that I must endure for my future.

I'm only 17 and there's a huge road ahead of me. I didn't come this far for no reason.

So let's get grinding. I'll see you bastards in a month!

I suddenly decided right when 2007scape was launched that I wanted to be a top smither. After mining a lot on the first day, I then bought my ores and bars to level smithing. At first the prices were low and I was able to break even or make a small profit margin to buy more ores and bars.

After spending an average of 10-16 hours a day (I'm unemployed and have no life) on this, I am now one of the top smithers and level 76 smithing. I made a little bit of money on full mith sets and now that I can make addy scimitars, I have another opportunity to make a little bit of money before the price of ores goes up and the price of addy scimmys goes down.

What bothers me so much is that my ability to make any gp off of my hard work is being questioned. I get messages several times a day from miners and other random strangers who say that they have the ores to make addy scimitars and request that I use their materials to make these items for them. When I ask how much they'll pay me, they sound shocked that I would suggest such a thing.

**""Don't you want free exp?""** they ask me. No, I don't. Will you mine 1000 coal to give to me? It's free exp!! I wouldn't ask that. I have paid a few million for ores and bars and profited next to nothing. Shouldn't I make just as much as the miners? Sure, without them I wouldn't have ores, but without me their ores would be useless. If you want an addy scimitar, buy one. If you have ores, but don't have the ability to make them into something, then sell the ores to someone who does.

1375332192.0,46,self.2007scape,1jh2q4,"Watch for the player ""Ukem"" and his intricate scam. It almost got me, and it's gotten people before.",klaberrduff,60,14,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/1jh2q4/watch_for_the_player_ukem_and_his_intricate_scam/,"First off, I assume it is a successful scam because he was wearing a Dragon Chain and an additional ~3m in items. Second, I'm also assuming that he targeted me because I buy large quantities of expensive crafting supplies on the popular (and easily accessible) forum Zybez. I'm assuming he targets specific players because it would seem that this scam takes a fair amount of time to prepare, so it would only be worth it for players with a fair amount of wealth (not trying to brag or anything, just that he could have gathered that from zybez).

With that being said, this is how I was approached by Ukem. He found me in game and said something along the lines of:

Ukem: Hey klabbs, was the video with Smoothie a setup?

Me: I have no idea what you're talking about. What video?

Ukem: You haven't watched it? lol go to RuneClips and type in ""klabbs is a noob""

Now, typing this out it seems more obvious that it's fishy, but his intention is to catch you off guard by attempting to direct your attention to the fact that some apparently popular video maker called you a noob. Naturally, one would be intrigued.

So I go to this site and I see [this](http://imgur.com/yA3T07r), and when I search ""klabbs is a noob"" I see [this](http://i.imgur.com/Kp16SLy.jpg). In hindsight the website looks off, and I was trying to be cautious at this point, but in all honesty this does resemble a Runescape-related fansite and it is pretty convincing. From this point on it resembles a traditional scam, where you go to watch a video and ""your java is not updated"" where you're prompted to update, which contains a phishing program.

I just think that this hack is intricate enough for someone to potentially fall for and I would hate to see that happen. It raises questions in your head that a ""normal"" scam doesn't do and it can trigger a number of responses. ""A popular runescape uploader called me out? That's infuriating/interesting/incredible!"" These are all responses that can distract you from seeing the truth of this concept.

This post wasn't entirely created to watch out for this Ukem guy, I'm just trying to convey through this post that A) It is possible to be exploited of personal information through websites like zybez (because I'm pretty confident nobody would code a fake video link for *specifically me* if they knew I had no money). B) It is possible to let your emotions get the best of you (like excitement, frustration, curiosity) and can serve as the perfect distraction to be scammed. and C) Like everything to do with this game, it is important to be careful of third-party links and be cautious of everything, and you will not be scammed (also always wear a Ring of Life, no questions asked! haha)

I'd appreciate if you would take the time to upvote this post so it can reach as most people as possible, as of course I receive no karma for it. Thanks for reading!

it is nearly impossible for me to keep 100 percent up time on burnners

the smoke to see if they are lit are fucking impossible to see honestly.

i am high alching btw, so i cant do shit while i am alching my guy just stands there.

i am going out of my way to let people use my altar (which i do accept donations, that arnt required for accese.)


i do not understand why people don't make sure that the altar burners are lit before you use you bone on the altar.

the entitlement from these people that use my altar is insane ""bro you are so fucking bad learn to keep burners up""

bring a marrentaill and tinderbox with you and light the fucking burner you damn self.

there are other hosters out there most of the timer, just join CC ""altar""

i just don't understand what these kids are expecting of me.

dont get me wrong there are ALOT of grateful people out there, but its really annoying the fuck out of me.

- **25 pure essence** (speak to the clan chat owner, you can often get this for free)

- **~1k gp** (more if you plan on doing this longer)

- **Anti-poison** (optional, available at the Karamja general store)

____

Before you do anything you need to find someone who is offering the service, there are a **lot** of people on the forums looking for runners. Some clan chats you can try:

- xsawnx

- sparzee

- Majick

- A Willbury

- esc1

- GETS HYPER

-

____

**Step 1:** Head to Port Sarim and catch a boat to Karamja. [**Picture**](http://i.imgur.com/5wzjDRY.png).

**Step 2:** From there take [**this route**](http://i.imgur.com/Hw87t2a.jpg) (you only need to do this once), you will arrive at a general store. 

**Step 3:** From there take [**this route**](http://i.imgur.com/Tby7Pog.png), which leads to the Nature altar. 

**Step 4:** At the altar you will see people usually dressed in robes holding a staff. Give them 25 rune essence (un-noted) and in return they will give you 25 back (noted) and 15 - 20 nature runes. 

**Step 5:** After the trade head back the way you just came from and sell your 25 rune essence to the general store, then immediately buy them back. Repeat this process.

Finally got 41 mining and 1k iron. The iron would pay for a rune pick right. So i got to west bank and all of a sudden i died from a guard... I dont think I clicked it (was a high pop world though so i prolly misclicked), but I died and lost all of it instantly. I didn't even get to say ""Selling iron ore"" before I died :p

Not mad at all though.. This is what runescape is about. Moments like this make the game. This is the game I love.

**EDIT 2: To those of you who can't quite wrap your head round this: You should NOT be billed whilst you're banned, for whatever reason. It should be automatically cancelled, like any reasonable person would expect it to be.

**EVENT IS CASTLE WARS - WORLD 34**


Hey all,

Unfortunately paramedicine is out of town this weekend so he won't be able to run any events for us tonight.

I've picked up the pieces last minute and thrown together a poll for what people want to do tonight.



* **[Castle Wars](http://www.runehq.com/oldschoolminigame/castle-wars)**
**Requirements:** None 

This game is a classic capture the flag game which adheres itself to all levels. It is also a safe minigame. Rewards are tickets which can be exchanged for decorative armour.





* **[The poll can be found here](http://www.easypolls.net/poll.html?p=518cf222e4b0df6bcbc7744d)**    We will meet on W45 at **[11pm GMT](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Reddit+Event&amp;iso=20130510T23&amp;p1=303&amp;ah=2)**, announcements of the event will take place in the cc at least 20minutes before the game is due to start. I shall also make a fresh post 20 minutes before with an announcement.


Any questions/problems reply on here, contact me ingame or click my twitch in the sidebar.

Regards

Zelden

""We haven't changed any reward distributions in treasure trails since OSRS came out. I think the Jmod in question may have quoted a misleading statistic...

The chance of a reward item being 3rd age platelegs is indeed less than 1/100000.
However, there are twelve 3rd age items. So that'd be 12/100000, not 1/100000.
Then you get between 4 and 6 (inclusive) items at a time. So we're now looking at a much larger chance of getting something 3rd age in your reward chest.

Statistics isn't my thing, but I reckon it's more like 0.04% of getting at least one 3rd age item in the chest.""

If that's not enough evidence to divert you away from the 1/100,000 statistic, a bot from RSWiki has collected information from the top 300,000 players' adventurer logs.  The results are as follows:

30 days, 190,926 hard clues completed:

""If a world is full, players trying to log into it will be placed in a queue, rather than having to repeatedly login until there is space.""

I would like to point out that if this passes, then the queues to get into the trade worlds would be extremely long. I feel we should vote no on this, because if the queue is put in, then players would have to wait longer than if they just kept pressing connect. This is just my opinion, please post your's so I can make a better decision before I vote.

Sadly, after the removal of the wilderness in 2007, multi-pking has never really come back, and in the last few years of the main game, it’s been quite dead.   However, it seems as if it may be returning in OSRS. 

After checking a lot in the first 2-3 weeks of old school runescape, I was pretty sad about the lack of activity in the varrock wilderness.  There was pretty much no one there, and all the pkers seemed to be content pking in edgeville, which can get quite old to me after a while.  However, today I decided to check varrock wild in a highly populated world! And whaddaya know, there was actually quite a bit of activity there, mainly level 40s-60s.  

I am writing this now for those of you that PK in the hopes that you will help me re-create the enjoyable atmosphere in multi-pking that RS use to have.  Multi-PKing is in it's beginning stages, and what we do with it now will ultimately influence what it will turn into.  I want you to think of what you would like multi-pking to be like in the future, and ask yourself what you can do to help it become like that.  Do you want it to grow even more? Spend 20 minutes every day hanging around varrock wilderness and contribute to it's popularity! It will make even more people come when they see the growing numbers!  Be the change that you want to see! Are you tired of large teams of people preying on small teams and scaring people away from multi-pking? Then be the one to say no to large teams trying to recruit and avoid teaming with huge amounts of your friends at a time! (Unless you're pking at deeper levels which would be totally fine).  Don’t contribute to the problem.  Don’t BS people that you team with! Ask a few people to team if you're solo!

Basically this guy was running around varrock advertising a give away, and i have seen him being followed around before being called a scammer,  so i decided to join his twitch @ twitch.tv/woolleywonka and watched him to his 'showdown'. When he earned players trust and then basically scammed them all, at this point i was thinking its all their fault and its a touh life, but then he started showboating his paypal page rom all of his RWT... Thats when i felt the need to post this.
More proof that he RWT's is theres a few videos on his youtube channel 'www.youtube.com/ryanwoolley' where he is worth around 1b+, but cerrently is only worth around 300m... Can we please get a JMoD to see this and get this lowlife out of our community. His past names were 'A Zerk A' 'A Dragoon' and now 'X 3D Age X'. Some of you guys have probably seen him just standing at varrock center saying 'Give me 3m for an epic Surprise', just watch his videos and see for yourself.
