1371114014.0,82,self.ramen,1g9ak6,I studied Yatai (ramen food stands) in Japan for a year! AMA,yataiguy,96,14,117,http://www.reddit.com/r/ramen/comments/1g9ak6/i_studied_yatai_ramen_food_stands_in_japan_for_a/,"Hello everyone! I am using a throwaway account, don't care about karma. If anyone actually cares, I'll be answering questions whenever!

My name is David, and I studied ramen food stands in Fukuoka, Japan for a year as part of the Fulbright program by the U.S. Government. It was an amazing adventure, and I have lots of stories to tell. It was a real treat to receive grant money to study something so few people knew about (probably don't care about either!). I did my research between 2010-2011, so my knowledge is a little dated. I am giving my information because I think it would be pretty easy to find an American who studied ramen in Fukuoka.

My profile on the U.S. Consulate Website:
http://fukuoka.usconsulate.gov/f-20110824-01.html

Yatai are very famous in Fukuoka, not only for their food. The connection with the city dates back to around World War II. Yatai in Fukuoka create an environment unlike any other city in Japan. 

The unsavory aspects of Yatai, including hygiene issues and connections with the Yakuza, made it a really interesting historical case study.

Fukuoka is most famous for tonkotsu ramen. Please check out ramen restaurants like Ichi-ran or Ippudo if you live in Tokyo for a taste! New York City now has an Ippudo! The pork-bone based soup (with extra al dente noodles) is to die for.

**edit 1** Proof: http://i.imgur.com/1x31rFJ.jpg?1

**edit 2** I live in Japan and work tomorrow, so going to bed soon, but I'll keep answering questions as they come!

**edit 3** A few pictures: Parking lot of Yatai, the Yatai operation ( a drawing of how they work), and a picture of some ramen: http://imgur.com/ndIq5so

**edit 4** This has been so amazing. I really found the right subreddit to do this AMA. Thanks so much for all your questions. If you have any lingering questions, please PM me! I plan on using this account for the /r/ramen subreddit. Also, this is a self-plug, but I've been researching Japanese energy security for the last year, if anyone is interested in that, please let me know! Awesome enough, my yatai experience has created amazing opportunities in my life. Thanks guys.

Then I went to Japan. My boyfriend and I visited a few ramen shops in Kyoto and Tokyo, and then visited the original Japanese Ippudo's in Tokyo, and it was AMAZING. The broth was white - thick and creamy. The black garlic oil lent a delicious flavor, and made the broth less heavy. The chashu melted in my mouth. And the noodles. Ah those noodles; fresh made, chewy and soft, none of that spongey texture from package ramen. The bowls were big enough to feed two but I finished every single one of them to the last drop. Folks, you guys need to find some real ramen, it is truly the stuff of dreams.

2. after a short period of time (before garlic or sriacha burns), add soy sauce and fish/anchovy/worchestire, let some moisture evaporate to caramelise the sugars a bit, (upgrade: saute mushrooms until they have released all their water and then reabsorbed the flavorful oil, or saute meat to leave brown fond and set aside), add broth and deglaze

**Why?**

- For fun
- To get an awesome flair (a ramen bowl icon)

**Rules:**

- No Restaurant pics

- Any type of noodle (instant, homemade, etc)

- Crazy concoctions OK (Sheppards pie, omelettes, buns, muffins etc) 

- Put * RamenOff * At the start of your post

- 1 day? 2 days? 3 days?

**Questions**

- ~~How long do you think it should last?~~ One week should be enough time for the first one. So from now until Sunday the 27th at midnight. Voting can be for 4 days, and we will announce the winner on February 1st. 
- ~~Should there be some sort of proof in each picture (i.e. username or r/ramen written down)?~~ Some sort of proof verifying both username, and that the ramen is homemade.
- ~~What do you think we should do?~~ More suggestions are welcome!

If everyone likes this sort of thing we could do it monthly. 

Special thanks to BIGBADVIRUS and arydactl for starting this!

EDIT

Thanks for the input and suggestions! 

- Some kind of Iron man ingredient challenge would be great, but for the first one we will give everyone the flexibility to choose all the ingredients. Maybe later we could have themed ramenoffs as well as ingredient challenges. 
- Upvotes do not seem like the best way to determine the winner, so we will use a third party voting site to do this. 


So the deadline to enter is one week from now, good luck everyone!

I have an idea for a ramen subscription box.

I currently run a wholesale export business here in Japan, and a small individual scale export in addition. My Wife has started a subscription box service in her free time with the resources already available (packing, shipping courier, postal discounts etc). I have been thinking about doing the same thing, for Ramen.

Does /r/ramen think this could be something viable? I know ramen is seen as a budget food sometimes, but I want this service to be a ""Premium Ramen Box"". 

What I want to do is send out 5 premium ramen packs per month (large packs of regional/seasonal flavors). With shipping and inventory, this would cost the user about $19.99 - $27.99 per month. 

Anyway, I don't want to advertise but I just wanted to ask for your thoughts on a service like this and what you would like to see if it did come to fruition.

Thanks!",,False,self,t5_2qykd,False,,,True,t3_1ivcos,http://www.reddit.com/r/ramen/comments/1ivcos/ramen_subscription_box_thoughts/,

This being my first order, I had high expectations, unfortunately the product actually took **3 weeks** to reach me once my order was confirmed, and as I am unsure if this is the norm (they say 5 business days,) is a huge red mark against them. On the flip side, their customer service was fairly prompt to my irate emails, and they even included 5 extra ramen I on top of what I ordered. 

Minus shipping, it wound up costing about a dollar per unit, which is on par with the Sapporo Ichiban I can buy at my local grocer, but definitely more expensive then your Top and Maruchan ramen. The quality is for sure noticeably better though and you get the benefit of mix and matching whatever you want.

There is no reason to ever use pre-prepared, ""instant"" miso bases ever again. True miso soup base, which is the base for most ramen style dishes is made up of two or three basic ingredients.

1. A protein base: Niboshi (Cured Dried Sardines), Katsuobushi (Benito Shavings) or Dried Shitake. Any and all of these can be found at just about any good Asian grocery. 

2. Kombu: big sheets of dried kelp. Again, any good Asian grocery. Since the Fukushima incident, i search for the stuff made in Korea, not Japan.   

3. Miso: White miso is preferable if making actual miso soup. If you're making miso ramen it's a bit more of a broad interpretation and personal taste. I prefer red miso for spicy dishes and full on tarry black miso in very small quantities if i'm doing anything with root veggies and beef. White miso I find to be the best choice for basic ramen with veggies or ramen with seafood as it doesn't overpower the other flavors. 

The Protien + Kombu make Daschi soup stock, adding miso is what makes it miso soup :D

The recipe below is a basic guideline; I tend to only make this when i'm cooking for at least 2 people, though it can serve as many as you want!

Technique:

Step 1: Saucepan + Cold Water and Bring to Boil, then step down to a low simmer. 

Step 2: Add your Kombu. I suggest a palm-sized piece for every quart of water, but YMMV based on quality of the kombu. Maintain the simmer for about 3 minutes. 

Step 4: Remove from heat, add a small palm full (aprx 1/3c) of unpacked, fluffy benito flakes or about the same of dried shitake. Let stand for 3-5 minutes for Benito or up to 10 minutes for shitake.

I don't use niboshi, so I can't suggest quantity. 

Step 5: Strain through a metal sieve, I use cheesecloth or clean paper towel to filter it clear, but that's just personal choice.  If you use shitake, you can just pick the Kombu out, but again, personal preference. Reserve about 1/2 cup of this broth per person. 


Step 6: This is where you want to return it to the heat, bring to a simmer and add your ramen, somen or soba noodles and any other ingredients you'd normally add to the broth base (eggs, sesame, green onion)

Step 7:  Use the reserved broth to cream the miso in a small bowl and stir in. Transfer to your bowl(s), add garnishes, extra ingredients, etc. 


Congrats. You just made from-scratch Miso Ramen Soup, you also avoided MSG. 

*the Kombu naturally contains the precursor to MSG, most people who are sensitive to MSG don't react to the glutamic acid.

I've tried googling this to no avail. A friend of mine mentioned that a local ramen shop is offering a jigoku ramen special. I'm interested in trying it out, but Google isn't telling me much about what it typically is.

Any chance someone here can shine some light on it? Things I'm wondering: what kind of broth is typical, what kind of meat, and how spicy.

Thanks!

EDIT: The one thing I didn't try until after this was just to translate jigoku, which means Hell. So it may just be very spicy ramen. 

EDIT 2: I it was, in fact, a very spicy shoyu ramen. I went with the spicy miso ramen instead. I'll try the jigoku sometime soon.",,False,self,t5_2qykd,1367284840.0,,,True,t3_1dc437,http://www.reddit.com/r/ramen/comments/1dc437/question_whats_jigoku_ramen/,

I based this off the spirit of the ""Cooking with Dog"" Yakibuta ramen recipe. Some time in the future I'd love to give the Momofuku noodle bar broth base a whirl, but I'm just getting into ramen at home (I cook a LOT, but not so much Japanese food) and for now I'll just stick to going there from time to time. It's an AMAZING soup, but it's so time consuming to reproduce it'll have to wait until I have some serious down time. if anyone is in NYC I would suggest they also check out ""Ramen Setagaya"" on 2nd ave. It's not as expensive, lacks a massive to wait to get inside, and in my opinion is more lovely.

www.ramensetagayany.com

Anyway, I took a slice of uncooked pork butt off a bone-in slab (for another meal tomorrow) and browned it in sesame oil and braised it in veal stock to cook off the fat and give the stock a porky flavor. Separately I took white mushrooms (too lazy to get to an asian market for something more authentic) and scallions and rendered their flavors into some water with white miso paste. I used a dried but not fried ramen noodle brick from my local market, I'll get around to buying the fresh stuff next time. Once the noodles were cooked I laid them in the bowl and poured equal parts of both stock and broth on top. Sliced raw mushrooms, scallions, diakon radish, a soft boiled egg marinated in mirin and soy with white sesame seeds (from this morning), the rested and sliced pork butt, and salmon teriyaki accompany the ramen. It came out pretty good! The teriyaki recipe is pretty basic btw; soy sauce, lemon juice, honey, jaggery (I make a lot of indian food at home). Just pan seared it and spooned the sauce on top until it thickened up. Yum.

Thanks to everyone in this reddit for posting their wonderful soup creations, I have been lurking around for some time and just wanted to say hello. Hello.

OK so, am going through stocking the cupboards. What are the cupboard items one must have to help a nice bowl of ramen along. Having joined the rat race and being single cooking seems long winded ( still manage a decent stir fry ) doing my best to break away from the take away habit.

I returned home last week, and since then I've been craving it badly. I haven't had time to drive an hour away to the nearest Korean grocery store, so I stopped by my local Walmart to see if I could whip up something similar to satisfy my craving, and it turned out pretty yummy! Here's what I used:    
     
* 1 packet Shin Ramyeon
* 1/2 small can of Spam, sliced thinly
* 1/2 teaspoon of minced garlic
* 1 slice of American cheese (okay, this is a lie. I actually used three slices but I like mine disgustingly cheesey. I'll probably use 1 1/2 or 2 slices next time I make it, as I went a little overboard this time.)    
    
1. Pour 2 1/3 water into a small pot. Place the sliced Spam, garlic, seasoning packet, and spice packet into the pot, and bring the water to a boil (I usually add in the spice packet last, but I wanted the Spam to absorb the flavors well).
2. Once the water is boiling, place the noodles into the pot and cook them for about two minutes.
3. Turn the burner to a slightly lower heat, so the water is boiling gently. Place a slice of cheese on top of the noodles, and, taking a spoon, scoop some of the broth up and pour it over the cheese. Continue until it is melty.
4. Eat!
    
     
Some people may be turned off by the cheese, but at least try it once! It gives both the noodles and broth a creaminess that's extremely delicious.   
   
Here are a few other items that you can add to make it even more tasty:
    
    
* Replace the half of the water with beef or chicken broth
* Kimchi (Korean spicy pickled cabbage)
* Green onions
* Pepperoni
* Hot dogs
* Bologna
* Mushrooms
* Baked beans
* Frozen dumplings",,False,self,t5_2qykd,False,,,True,t3_yvzqr,http://www.reddit.com/r/ramen/comments/yvzqr/i_tried_making_budaejjiigae_army_stew_with_what_i/,

I love ramen. I really love ramen. I love ramen entirely too much.

What I want is a good oriental tasting broth... dark and spicy. The problem is I need to do this with literally as little sodium as possible, being on a bit of a dietary limit. Using even half of the flavor packets would be unfavorable for me.

Would anyone have any good suggestions to achieve a good, (preferably quick) flavorful broth with minimal sodium?

Traditionally I've used Maruchan but I never really liked it all that much because the quality of their brick noodles are  rather lackluster in my opinion. They taste sort of doughy and don't have the springiness you would expect from ramen. There are a few Oriental groceries nearby I could visit to pick up some more exotic brands, but at 4-5 times the cost.

The soup base is not a HUGE deal for me since  I usually season with random stuff I have in my fridge, but, for relatively cheap, does anyone know if there is a ramen brand that has good quality ramen noodles for non premium ramen prices? I think Sapporo Ichiban is better, but I have no idea about Top Ramen.

From what I can tell Maruchan's cup noodles use a different noodle than their brick ramen that has better texture, but again, it's rather wasteful and you get much less ramen per package so I'd have to get two.

Thanks!

Birds Nest was coincidentally the name of these dishes. They served the nest empty and you'd fill it with wok+sauce or simply dip it and chew. After being in contact with sauce for a few minutes the nest would inevitably become soft.

I would very much like to be able to recreate this on my own. My theory is that you'd boil the ramen as usual, then dry roast them in the oven using something bowl shaped (steel bowl perhaps?). 

These ramen were also awesomely delicious on their own, so I'd imagine that they were probably boiled in some kind of broth.

I'd prefer to find a good cookbook that highlights different regional styles of broths, noodles, toppings, etc. Anyone know of a good one?

I've been playing around lately making ramen - using a homemade chicken stock with a bit of chili paste and some brown rice miso, then adding soba noodles, scallions, bean sprouts, mushrooms, some cooked chicken or tofu, and usually some lime and cilantro to give it some zip - but I'm guessing that, to a long time ramen eater, this would probably be the rough equivalent of spaghetti with ketchup and cheddar cheese... in the ballpark, but nowhere near traditional. Then, recently, I made a (fairly) proper Tonkotsu broth and it blew my mind.

So I'm wondering if there's a definitive resource for this information. I can find recipes here and there online, but I'm hoping to find an all-in-one type reference book or cookbook about it.

Should pork fat be added to the broth?  And when the broth becomes gelatinous in the fridge, do I have to add water when I heat it up again?

Every year (starting in 2012), I am running a special Momofuku Ando Day thing over at The Ramen Rater. For those of you who do not know, Momofuku Ando was the inventor of instant noodles as well as the cup noodle. I'll be reviewing some special noodles from Japan (Nissin Raoh) and if you're interested, you can join in on the special Momofuku Ando Day Show Your Noodles, where you can send in your pictures of instant (or otherwise) ramen that you've created and it'll be on the site!

I had a website and application suggestion for you all to check out:

Website: [The Ramen Database](http://ramendb.supleks.jp/)

[Ramen Map application](http://www.appannie.com/app/ios/ramen-map/)

The website:
This website is the ramen nerds guide to ramen here in Japan.  Showing what's trending, rising/falling in shops. Store photos ramen photos reviews etc.
Thing is that it's in Japanese.
But it's pretty easy to get the hang of once you learn the basic Japanese words.  Also, Chrome can translate a good amount of the text.

The Ramen Map application:
This free application is tied to the before mentioned website.  It's cool because it can track where you are and show you ramen shops around you.  And they continently color the shop locations for you on the google map to show their ranking. (Red location=high ranking, orange= high/medium, etc)

Sadly both these items chiefly work only here in Japan. 
But if you live here and love ramen give it a try!
If you are visiting also give it a try!
Studying Japanese?  Why not enjoy it too!

TL;DR:
The website and application are great tools for finding ramen in Japan!

I'm trying to find one of my favorite brands from back then, but Uwaji doesn't seem to stock it anymore.

I'd thought all instant-ramen was just a block of noodles and a packet of flavor-powder and *maybe* dried vegetables *if lucky.* I grew up on Cup Noodles and Top Ramen and Maruchan, and ever since I found Uwaji I can't stand them anymore; I *have* to spice it up a little whenever I'm forced to resort to the boring cheaper stuff.

This was a tonkotsu variety - a large bowl perhaps 7-8"" in diameter, 2-3"" tall - whose lid may have been purple or magenta, and which included actual large slices of cured pork in the sauce packet, which was a first for me at the time.

* Second I find that the collagen that turned into jelly after chilling the stock overnight is plenty so it is definitely rich.

Don't try to eat all of it.  You WILL get sick if you eat both servings!


Now that you've been warned,  here is the recipe! 

2 Squares of Chicken Ramen with seasoning

1 package of thick cut bacon (optional, but really, you can't pass it up.)

One can of Cambell's  Cream of Chicken



First,  throw the cream of chicken in a medium sized pot in the stove, cooking at medium heat.  Follow directions on cream of chicken  to cook.   Start frying up that delicious bacon too the crispy/chewiness you prefer, and do it shirtless.

Second, cook the noodles any way your heart desires.  Microwave, stove top, or just throw them right in the cream of chicken(throwing it in the cream of chicken will take longer, but it still works)!

Third, eat a strip of bacon to tide yourself over, and then chop up the rest into bite sized bits.  

Forth, combine Bacon bits, Noodles, and seasoning packets into the cream of chicken.  Continue to cook until the ingredients are thoroughly mixed.

Fifth, Grab a Beer, a Cigar, your favorite Rammstien CD, and a friend, feast to your stomach's capacity, throw the left overs in the fridge.
