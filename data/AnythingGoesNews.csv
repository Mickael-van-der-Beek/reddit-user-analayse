I read through all 7 parts of [Lucian Randolph's plan](https://plus.google.com/103984595971776502972/posts/9fUWoNmzbZb) to use the Freedom Contract Party to return political power back to the people, and it is inspiring. He even calls out Reddit as the best place to start the crowd-sourcing effort to spread the ideas of the FCP in [Part Six](https://plus.google.com/103984595971776502972/posts/9pUxoys8eqX). We have come together as a community before to battle against SOPA and PIPA, and now we have a chance to not only prevent the corrupt system from getting worse, but to reverse the corruption all together.

Was told this might not make it anywhere in [/r/politics](/r/politics) so posting here as well.

TL;DR The Freedom Contract Party is a conceptual political party that would require any candidate running for political office as an FCP candidate to sign a contract before being nominated that states they will adhere to the core concepts of the FCP, and if they do not, they will be removed from office via a re-election process. This is similar to how business treat their CEOs. If they perform well according to the requirements provided by shareholders and the board, then they retain their position. If not, then they are quickly replaced. Essentially, accountability for political actions. Another key concept is that there is no such thing as incumbency, anyone who is elected can only serve one term, and can never serve another term in that position again. Simply another corruption-prevention mechanism. These are only a couple of the basic concepts, and I urge anyone interested in changing how the American political system works to read all seven parts, it is definitely worth it.",,False,self,t5_2t3u0,True,,,True,t3_s0u49,http://www.reddit.com/r/AnythingGoesNews/comments/s0u49/how_to_legally_and_peacefully_return_political/,

1347103163.0,50,self.AnythingGoesNews,zjvl3,Criticism of Israel now a hate crime by law in California Universities,ChuckSpears,88,38,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/AnythingGoesNews/comments/zjvl3/criticism_of_israel_now_a_hate_crime_by_law_in/,"&gt;Last month, the California State Assembly passed a resolution urging state educational institutions to more aggressively crack down on criticism of the State of Israel on campuses, which the resolution defines as “anti-Semitism.” The anti-democratic resolution is the latest step in the broader campaign to stifle and suppress dissent on California’s increasingly volatile campuses.

&gt;The California State Assembly is the lower house of the state legislature, consisting of 80 members. The resolution—H.R. 35: “Relative to anti-Semitism”—was passed by a vote of 66 to 80, including a majority of both Republicans and Democrats in the Assembly.

&gt;The resolution was drafted by Republican Linda Halderman and passed without public discussion. The vote on the resolution came when most students were between semesters and away from their campuses.

• “language or behavior [that] demonizes and delegitimizes Israel;”

• “speakers, films, and exhibits” that indicate that “Israel is guilty of heinous crimes against humanity such as ethnic cleansing and genocide;”

• describing Israel as a “racist” or “apartheid” state;

• “student-and faculty-sponsored boycott, divestment, and sanction campaigns against Israel;”

• “denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination;”

• “applying double standards by requiring of Israel a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation;” and

• “actions of student groups that encourage support for terrorist organizations such as Hamas and Hezbollah.”
