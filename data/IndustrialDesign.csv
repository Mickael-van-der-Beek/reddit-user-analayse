1365270502.0,81,self.IndustrialDesign,1bt08n,Minimalist Tape Dispenser.,Methylene_Chloride,90,9,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/IndustrialDesign/comments/1bt08n/minimalist_tape_dispenser/,"This sub-reddit is a bit quiet, so I thought I could post up some recent work of mine to design a tape dispenser.


This is a 2nd year University project to design, manufacture and sell 20 of a product. Most people focussed on keeping it chap and simple, I wanted to design it to be cheap and simple. So here it is.


After initial brainstorming and rough sketching of ideas, I settled on the tape dispenser, and I wanted it to be a functional, simple to use product. I came to the conclusion that a single piece of polypropylene bent around the role of tape with a serrated edge would work, so I went ahead and made a batch of prototypes testing lots of different things. 


http://i.imgur.com/9a8f8qv.jpg


It failed, every single one failed completely, in every imaginable way. I at this point could either change my product, or make it work. Back to brainstorming and looking at other dispensers. Looking at how they worked, why they worked and what made them worked I figured out why mine didn't. I done this before redesigning, to not waste time and effort on a flawed idea. 


A solid material was needed, so I changed to acrylic, again lots of different designs I started to change what I was designing, It stopped being consumer and cheap and it became more aesthetic, even a bit designer. I still focused on function, like all of my design work but kept an eye on the aesthetic, playing with shape and personality.

Finally, one of them worked. So far I counted roughly 40 prototypes, and one worked. But I wanted to know why only one of them worked, the where cut from the same sheet, using the same machine at the same time with the same (roughly) serrations. But only one worked. 


My theory was that it was the angle of the serration, so for my next batch they had the same serration, copy and pasted. I then changed a few to be a bit wider, taller, thinner, less of an angle etc. 


None worked. This project became an obsession, grades didn’t matter, other work was put aside and I needed to know why It didn’t work. I used a microscope, endless testing and testing. Two rolls of tape later I realised why. So a new set of prototypes where on their way for the next day...


http://i.imgur.com/o0FAhgZ.jpg


they all worked, I could relax. Now I could look back at what I had designed. I stepped back and looked at the latest batch and I had three options:


Option 1: Make a consumer tape dispenser (original plan)
Option 2: Make it smaller into a key ring
Option 3: Focus on aesthetic, make it ""designer""


I chose option 3 after much deliberation, talking to peers and tutors about it, because of development cost and the more expensive material, making it cheap and selling it cheap wasn't a viable option. I needed to add value to the product.


http://i.imgur.com/KPjoeB6.jpg

Now I had two options for my aesthetic. The face, which I named ""Tape Mate"", or the leaf, which I named ""The Last Leaf"". I ended up taking it to vote with everyone I knew and met, and just carried an example of each in my blazer pocket. 


The outcome was the leaf, so I was onto Final development of the product, and my final 4 prototypes. 


http://i.imgur.com/yOaXWRZ.jpg


And then onto my final product, a minimalist tape dispenser. I believe it is the smallest tape dispenser for a full size roll. And it is universal, as the roll sits underneath it can take any diameter and up to 30mm wide tape. It is also I believe the only tape dispenser to be made from a single material.



Here is the final product, and a .gif of me using it.

I feel like our field is highly unknown, and not well defined. 

I've been told I make factories, machinery, that I am an engineer, that I'm an artist, or that they were completely oblivious. I'm in my senior year and my family still asks what my degree is called.

I feel like the fall back thing to do is say ""Product Design"" but that even confuses people so I move on to saying ""everything you buy in a store was designed by someone like me...""



Also I noticed that there are many titles that describe our field while searching job listings:

* Industrial Design

* Product Design

* Consumer Design

* Commercial Design


Edit: I get the feeling from your responses that it becomes easier when you have a focused area/industry to work within. Saying ""I design phones"" or ""Automotive Design"" is really less confusing, and if you work for a company chances are you'd just say something like ""I design product at Sony/Nike/GE/hasbro"" and people will understand what you do.

I think the hardest thing to describe would be if you worked for a consultancy and have no area of expertise since you work on a broad spectrum of things every day.

We wanted to solve the problem of headphones getting tangled and broken in your pockets and getting lost all together. With phones getting thinner an thinner, we thought we could make a winding mechanism that's thin enough to integrate into a phone case.

After 29 3D printed prototypes, we have come to a design that is very functional, sleek, and compact. We've been making our prototypes based on the iPhone 5, and have it thinned down enough that the iPhone 5 with case is thinner than the original iPhone 3G with no case.

We're calling our product, ""TurtleCell"" since its peripherals retract into a neat, protective shell. Please comment with any critiques you may have and other features you might like to see added. If we're successful with this launch, we're hoping to include a microphone and extended battery in future iterations.

Here are some renderings of our model that I've made for presentation purposes:

Also, we've started to get the ball rolling on the business side of getting investors and moving toward a large scale manufacturing run. Here's our website and a link to our kickstarter pages, which include videos of the case in action and photos of the existing prototypes.

I didn't think being a girl mattered until...,drunk_vegetarian,25,7,60,http://www.reddit.com/r/IndustrialDesign/comments/17u5sb/any_female_industrial_designers_here_i_need_to/,"I realized that my professor has no respect for me. While talking with classmates we were discussing one of our professors and I began to vent. About how he constantly talks over me, or stops listening when I ask for perspective on a project to suddenly talk to another student, or he walks out of the room while answering one of my questions. A classmate agreed that the professor gives me a harder time than most others, and another chirped in that the prof treats the program like a boy's club. I'm glad to graduate this semester, but I feel like my grad project might suffer from lack of insight and help since this professor is the grad final leader. I've been working with an insightful classmate instead of bothering with the prof. It's so discouraging for going to a class he teaches.

I'm often the only girl in my classes. There's a total of three others total in the major, plus one woman who already had a career in the military and a family. I separate the last classmate because she's much more bull-headed and less willing to take crap from anybody, and her age seems to buy respect and a sense of being the professor's peer. The professors made one of the other girls cry. (I wasn't a witness, but the girl always struck me as strong and the news was such a shock.)

In other situations, I was moving a large project when my boss exclaimed ""Wow! You're pretty strong for a chick!"" and when I went to a conference an established designer encouraged me to look into breast pump design EVERY TIME WE CROSSED PATHS. It took me ages until my classmates stopped teasing me, which was troublesome every time I tried to borrow tools. Someone once told an acquaintance that I'm ""a good designer for a girl."" It's wearing me down.

I'm hoping the (sexism?) weird treatment would be contained in school, but it seems to exist in the professional world too. How much of this is in my head? (It was incredibly validating to hear my classmates noticed the professor's behavior too.) This rant might sound like it belongs more in r/relationships, but I'd really like to hear from any graduate or female designers who faced anything similar, or overcame the situation.

I began working as a freelance creative designer, building my portfolio in both industries and watching my client contact list (very) steadily grow.

- I have my BFA in Photography, and while pursuing that I discovered ID.
- I completed the coursework for my MFA in ID, but I'm still working on my thesis.  A personal thesis with no given problem to solve was a challenge for me, and I didn't nail a starting concept until late in the last school year.
- Thesis took a back seat to a job search after school.  After 8 months of full-time job searching, my brother got me a tangentially related job as an engineer.

Now, I'm miserable at this job.  I design brackets and adapters, make technical CAD drawings and I'm discovering that my employer firmly believes that I went to school to be an engineer.  0% Creativity.  I've been there for 7 months now, and needless to say I'm still applying to other jobs 20-30 hours a week, looking for a way out.

I fear that my lack of degree and my stagnating/declining skills are much of what is holding me back.  My portfolio needs work that I can't give it right now. (portfolio: tomnasca.com)

There are those that suggest I leave my job to fast-track myself to becoming a more desirable and marketable candidate for a design job.  I have enough cash to support myself for 6 months.

I only recently discovered your field in my search for a new career path, and I'm trying to learn about it and whether it's something I should seriously consider. 

I'm 25, and graduated with a BA in studio art in 2008.  Since then, I've just worked where I could find a job- as a caricature artist in a theme park, and then as a bank teller.  I've been thinking a lot lately about going back to school, this time with a little more direction and with the aim of something that will help me get a job.  The art degree was paid for by scholarships, and I did not have any better idea what to do with myself at the time, so I don't regret it, but it hasn't been helpful where careers are concerned. 

Industrial design appeals to me because it requires both creativity and pragmatism, seems useful and interesting, and seems to focus on problem-solving, which was always my favorite part of art-making to begin with.  

However, I've been reading here and there about ID, and haven't gotten the impression that it's in high demand at the moment. It seems to me that, like a lot of technical art-related jobs, it would be something that gets outsourced a lot. But, I haven't found much solid information about the field yet. 

So, I'm curious - just how bad is the job market for industrial designers?  At 25, if I'm going back to school, I want to make sure it's for something that will lead to a good job.  I already have one degree that I'm not using.  

What skills does a industrial designer really need to use?  I have a strong art background, which seems like an advantage - but just how useful will that be?

What programs exist, and how does one get in them?  What kinds of classes do you generally take?

I really appreciate any information or advice you might have to offer.  I am just looking into different options for myself, and didn't really know ID existed as a field before a month or two ago.  I had googled ""engineering design"" because I figured there MUST be something that bridged the two.  So here I am.

Two years have passed by and now that I'm looking at applying to Grad school, I stand rather confused among all the fields that I can jump into. I want to work somewhere in the circle covering Interaction Design, Cognitive Science and Industrial Design. Past few months I've run across a lot of things that involve Industrial Design and it seems to me that Industrial Design would be the better choice for me because my background in Computer Science. Having this background will help me move into Interaction design if I want to in the future. Correct me if I'm wrong here.


I was speaking to someone I work with the other day and he mentioned to me that I don't have a good background for Industrial Design and would not be accepted into grad school. Although I don't have anything much Industrial Design related under my resume I have been working in Interface design and have lately been working as a designer at a new place where I work on Visualisations, Games, Digital and Print design. I'm pretty good sketching and I'm willing to brush up on it. I have some past work up on [my website](http://www.amarchadgar.com) It is not up to date. Please check it out and let me know if do have the qualifications for Industrial Design. 


Also, although I've been going through most of the discussions here regularly, what are the job prospects for an Industrial Designer with a background in Computer Science Engineering? Also can you guys recommend me some good schools for Graduate studies (with scholarship and financial support would be too much to ask for but great)?",,False,,t5_2qiv5,False,,,True,t3_vxngh,http://www.reddit.com/r/IndustrialDesign/comments/vxngh/to_id_or_not_to_id/,

**I am working on a project for school, but i'm currently debating on which topic to choose.**

First Topic- During my freshman year, the head of my school's department (which also happens to be our adviser/professor), gave us a supply list of what we would need for the year. Everything was pretty much self-explanatory- kneaded erases, white eraser, sketch pad, and etc. But then he listed 'markers', which obviously doesn't explain anything about brands/colors/shades/quantity. When we asked him, he said ""Buy which ever color you like and also two others- one that is lighter and darker."" But as the year went on, i realized that i needed to buy more markers than what he suggested. At the end of the year, i ended up with about 20 markers. Markers that i don't really use any more. 

So, What do you guys think about this?

**TL;DR- Topic 1** A color-customizing marker that customizes specific colors (maybe through color picking an image, physical object, through photoshop/Ai,) by using CMYK. [Similar to this.](http://www.gearfuse.com/color-picker-lets-you-grab-the-colors-of-nature/)

Second Topic- From what your just read, you can already get sense of how bad this professor was at introducing kids to ID. In fact he was horrible. So, for this second topic i was thinking of creating a kit, something that may look like [a carrying case of a hand drill](http://www.p-wholesale.com/upimg/17/700a2/impact-drill-kit-kf-6005-183.jpg). But instead of having tools it would have..

**TL;DR Topic 2** A starter kit(carrying case), that carries the essential utensils that your need when your are first starting ID- Paper samples (plains white, marker paper, transparency, etc.), grey scale markers, pencils (2H, F, and 2B), marker liners, and other things like that.

I have done quite a bit of woodworking in my own time and I think right now Furniture Design is high on my list on interests. 

Does anyone have any working knowledge of this program? How difficult is it to get into? My GPA is not the best by any means, but hopefully schools take into account that it is an engineering degree from a top ranked school (Virginia Tech). Do they even look at you if you're below a 3.0?

I noticed they had some entry level classes that you can take without being in the actual program. Are these worthwhile? I don't have any sort of portfolio, though I do do a fair amount of hobby woodworking and could possibly put something together from that.

I really like Pratt because it is highly ranked and I love NYC and am hoping to live there when I graduate whether I end up trying to get into the program or not. Would it be better for me to wait a year or two, try to work in a studio or with an engineering firm and then look into applying? If I take the Intro classes, I would guess that I'd have to do this anyway.

Finally, am I even in the right boat? I'm enjoying woodworking and I enjoy product design (I can spend hours on the internet looking at product and furniture design websites).

Designers (here) seem to work in a cocoon, separating themselves from the real world. We have a client who needs something and our designers would rather design something that will never work. Spools need to be a size for a reason, plastic needs a certain wall thickness to be strong, you need draft to make something.  All these are unnecessary as far as our designers are concerned.

I understand it's nice exploring concepts, but there is also a need to keep it real.  Nothing pisses a client off like showing something either they shoot down as impractical or we have to go back in a month and explain why it would not work.

Seeing students coming up with that is impossible to make is unfair to them - they don't know any better. Design education has a lot to answer for.

That trend has never stopped.  Since then, I've taken a variety of engineering courses (CAD, R+D, physics, robotics, etc.) and my projects have consistently blown the competition out of the water.  I dropped out of school due to some personal drama, but I never stopped building cool stuff.

I have the opportunity to go back to college soon (I'm 27), and I've been looking very seriously at Industrial Design.  I have one nagging issue though.  95% of the ID projects I see online look completely useless in real life.  They look to me like modern art intended to solve problems that don't exist in the first place.  I understand that most of these projects are probably displays of creativity rather than actual commercial products.  I have to wonder, is real design work so impractical?  

I'm used to making things that outperform the competition in ergonomics and user friendliness as well as function.  I love doing this and the more I do it, the more I find that human interaction with a product is what really makes or breaks it.  Most of my projects are for personal use, but I hope to get some of them into full scale production eventually.  

To recap: I love what I've read about Industrial Design as a profession, but when I look at people's projects I have my doubts.  Do Industrial Designers focus solely on form, or do they balance that with function and performance in a real work environment?

I'm leaning toward Long Beach, mostly because it's in my state and it ranks fairly well for ID. I've heard good things from many people about the school, it's only a couple hours from my home city, their program sounds awesome (especially the upper ""half""), and i have a friend in the ID program there.

on the other hand, Western Washington sounds interesting. I would like to go on adventure and live somewhere other then a beach town. Washington is a fantastic state from what i hear. but i don't know very much about the actual ID program it self.

The screen on this one actually gets pretty dim and hard to read unless the battery is fairly new. I used to take the battery out when I wasn't using it, but that gets tedious after a while.

Has anyone else found one that they really like that isn't crazy expensive?",,False,,t5_2qiv5,False,,,True,t3_19tkaz,http://www.reddit.com/r/IndustrialDesign/comments/19tkaz/noncrappy_caliper_suggestion/,

I randomly ran across you today... Maybe you can offer some advice?

I'm in the process of patenting a little device that a friend and I are working on. We're super excited about it and have high expectations for it but we've hit a speed bump and we're having a hard time getting over it.

Problem is I've spent a decent amount of money with an industrial designer here in town and have gotten nowhere with him. He's super nice and had what I thought was a genius plan but that didn't work out so now I feel like he's scrambling for ideas and not getting anywhere. 

I've approached a couple of other industrial designers separately and they all assure me they can give me a solution but want $$$ first to make it happen. Well that didn't really work out the first time so I'm not too eager to pay someone else to experiment. I've also now waited four months while this guy drags his feet and am still right where I started.

So what expectations am I allowed to have from the industrial designer? If he cannot produce should I request some of my money back or is that out of line? I'd like to move on but I don't want to waste my time or anyone else's time anymore.

I don't mind paying for the solution either! I'm confident that I'm not looking for anything that is impossible to make.

Maybe I can set up a contest? 

Or approach a school or organization?

I'm open to ideas. I have found that there are not many industrial designers in town. Google searches turn up a bunch of people with furniture in their portfolios but that's it. Lots of people know about metal and wood but I need softer material expertise like silicone and/or fabrics.

Oh and basically what I'm looking for is an enclosure for bracelet. There are electronics involved. 

Thanks for reading.

Realized a year ago that Industrial Design is exactly what I want to do with my life. I'm 21. Male.

I absolutely love sketching. Give me a day to myself to do whatever the hell I want: First thing I'll do is grab a pencil and a sketchbook. I love drawing cars, products, literally anything. I've taken a couple mechanical engineering and biomedical engineering classes (Product Design, Medical Device Design) and got a lot of experience sketching mechanical functions of products, mechanisms, blow-apart drawings, cross-sections, plane and perspective product views, etc. I find this stuff a LOT of fun. I wouldn't say my sketches will blow your mind, but they're very good at conveying the necessary information and are definitely very clean and well-drawn. A couple of the clients I worked with for the Product Design class actually said that I have very impressive sketching skills and that I should consider ID for graduate studies.

I'm currently working on a portfolio website where I showcase all the stuff I've done so far. Aside from ID, I've got a lot of web design experience, along with graphic design, print design, and photography. I'm putting all of this into my portfolio.

To cut to the chase, I'm not sure where to start for a career in ID. Literally no-one is going to hire an entry-level Industrial Designer. Everywhere I've looked, they want 2-5 yrs of experience. The only skill that I don't actually have that the employers are looking for are hardware prototyping skills. Nothing with form studies, foam models, scale models, functional hardware prototypes, proof-of-concept models, or anything like that at all. Most experience I've got with this is a couple gargoyle mugs I made out of clay which I glazed and painted later.

So, the bottom line is: Where do I look for experience in hardware prototyping? What can I do to actually get hired as an Industrial Designer? Should I get a Masters degree in Industrial Design, or should I just sketch more so that I have more to show employers?

**TL;DR: Wannabe Industrial Designer graduating with engineering degree. Have decent experience, good sketcher. Zero hardware prototyping skills/experience. How do I get a start in the field? Where do I get the prototyping and modeling experience? How and where can I get hired? Should I consider a masters degree? If so, where?**

Sorry for the boatload of questions. Any suggestions/tips/advice appreciated. Thanks in advance.

But I have never been able to draw, cubes in perspective is about my limit. I have tried warm up techniques, read books and watched videos. So I think for me it is more of a phycological thing, I can imagein my ideas, and draw them in CAD, just not on paper, I cant spin paper in 3D...

I just got a new assignment for school and I'm pretty stuck and without ideas. 

My assignment involves using a cardboard box to create something that could be useful in a docters without borders field hospital. We're supposed to use the same box that is now used for shipping medicine and emergency supplies. 

The first things I had in mind was to transform the box into some sort of cabinet which then could be used to store the medicine in an organized way. But that is the only thing i can really think of. And it's pretty obvious.

Pretty much anything useful in a field hospital/disaster context would be allowed to be designed with that box.

Does anyone have good ideas or things that could inspire me?

Thanks
