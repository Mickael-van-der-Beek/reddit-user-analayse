They imply that these folks are not ""real"" fans just because they weren't out there showing their support during the bad times as well as the good. 

Well I say this.  

Welcome.

There's plenty of room on the bandwagon.  Come on up, grab yourself a basket of garlic fries and a beer. You are my brother for as long as you decide to stay.  

If this postseason turns you into a lifelong fan, that's fantastic.  If you decide to go back to being indifferent to or even actively disliking baseball after October is over, then I'm sorry to see you go, but I hope to see you again when the Giants rise once more.

If you were to tell me at the beginning of the season

Melky was going to be all star MVP - then suspended for the rest of the year

That the dodgers were going to make the biggest trade in MLB history and the Giants blew them out in the west

That marco scutaro was going to finish 7th overall in NL batting average and become NLCS MVP

That the Giants would beat the Reds in the postseason after dropping the first two and winning three on the road

That the Giants  would come back from a 3-1 deficit in the NLCS and outscore their opponents they way they did in the last 3 games

That Barry Fuckin Zito would start Game 1 of the world series

That Pablo Sandoval would hit not 1, not 2, but 3 home runs in a World Series

That we would have a 3-0 lead in the World Series against the best pitcher in baseball and the triple crown winner

Well if you told me all of that I would of probably told you to shut up.

This is amazing!!!!!

One more game guys, one more game with our Perfect Game Throwing Pitcher.

Lets Fucking Go!!!!!!!!!!!!

REMEMBER: Although this is linked to /r/baseball, this is still the Giants GDT. As quoted from the FAQ's, ""Gameday Threads are a lot like a Giants sports bar -- it's filled with Giants fans and not all of them are sober :) Many posts will be immediate reactions to events. Often these reactions are emotional, visceral thoughts. It's best not to poke us with a stick -- please do not provoke spurious arguments.""

I was at game 4 and I thought we had it in the bag, not just from the advantage but how we played. You guys turned it around. To be honest, the 2012 Giants are a lot like the 2011 Cardinals. That's why I'm supporting you. Beat the Tigers. In 7 games. No less. Baseball is great because of the moments like Game 6 last year at Busch, like Game 7 2006 NLCS Bottom 9 bases loaded 2 out Wainwright vs. Beltran. Those are just the Cardinals' moments in the last few years.

We didn't deserve to win this year, you guys do. Make a few more of those moments and win it in front of the home fans, in extra innings, with a ball hit into the Cove. In the rain. Or not. This is what baseball is all about - we were that team last year, you guys are it this year. make your own moments and I hope you guys can pull out a ring.

Sorry if I rambled, but I love baseball because of moments and teams like this. Go get it and for the love of God may we never have to play you at AT&amp;T again in the playoffs.",,False,,t5_2s5xr,False,,stl,True,t3_11xg6f,http://www.reddit.com/r/SFGiants/comments/11xg6f/from_a_cardinals_fan/,

1358995883.0,111,self.SFGiants,175zr9,How i fell in love with San Francisco.,t_dip,121,10,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/SFGiants/comments/175zr9/how_i_fell_in_love_with_san_francisco/,"I thought I'd share my story about how profoundly the SF Giants have influenced and affected me. It might be long-winded but I promise I'll make my point :)

I'm an Australian who fell in love with and played baseball since I was 7 and followed MLB since I was old enough to know what it was. When I was 10 some family friends went to the US on a holiday and they brought me back a Boston Red Sox cap and from the day I received it I started following them passionately and proudly. This developed into a full blown obsession. I have 2 Red Sox tattoos and a room &amp; closet at home packed to the brim with Sox merch and memorabilia. I spend every waking moment checking scores, trades and stats but I'm virtually alone here because very few Aussies know anything about the sport.

About 6 years ago, I started seeing my girlfriend and slowly introducing her to baseball (which she knew practically nothing about), hoping that if she grew to love it, I could groom her to be a Red Sox fan and have someone to share my passion for my team with. This did not work.

In 2009 she watched her first Giants game on TV. It was a Lincecum start against Pittsburgh and she loved him and the team and the atmosphere and she decided that she'd follow them. Until that point, I'd been a die-hard American League guy and never thought too much about the NL and it's teams the way I did about my side of the competition. Her love for the team and it's players developed into a wild obsession too and in 2012 we got to travel through the US together (it was her first time). I took her to Boston and Fenway, hoping she'd love the place like I did. She enjoyed it but AT&amp;T beckoned and she withheld her judgement.

We made it to San Francisco with a week or so left in the season and I surprised her with seats 10 rows behind home plate for Lincecum's start against the Diamondbacks. She cried... and she loved getting to see him pitch. She didn't care that he got the L and didn't last more than a few innings. It was an irrelevant thing. Watching her excitement that night was one of the happier baseball moments I've had. For me, seeing the Giants play at AT&amp;T Park was an amazing experience but it was made all the more special by her reactions. It's her favorite place in America.

I'd started to find myself really caring about the Giants' results and their path to the playoffs before this and being in the city and feeling the buzz at games and hearing the M-V-P chants when Posey came up to the plate was infectious and inspiring and I was loving being a part of it, being stopped by random, friendly people on the street because I was repping a Giants tee and being asked my thoughts on their playoff hopes.

The crowning moments for me were first in a hotel room in LA as our journey wound down watching Game 5 of the NLDS and leaping up and down on the bed screaming as Posey's grand slam left the park. Secondly, it was hyperventilating as we sat in our rental car on the side of the road, listening to Zito keep the season alive against the Cardinals because we couldn't find anywhere to watch it in time. We sat at home, back in Australia and watched all 4 World Series games from our couch. When Cabrera took that last strike, the smile on my GF's face was bigger than I'd ever seen it. Much bigger than when we'd watched them do it in 2010.

The reason I felt the need to share all this is because since I spent my time in San Francisco, I've come to realize how wonderful the city and it's people are and how brilliant it's baseball culture is. You're very lucky to have such a great team and a friendly, hospitable, passionate supporter-base. Your team and your city have brought me closer to the love of my life and helped introduce her to a game that has shaped me into who I am today. While I'll always be a Red Sox fan, the Giants will hold a special place in my heart and every year from here on out, through thick and thin, I'll hope that the Giants conquer the NL and the MLB, if we don't beat them to the punch.",,False,,t5_2s5xr,1359005014.0,,1num,True,t3_175zr9,http://www.reddit.com/r/SFGiants/comments/175zr9/how_i_fell_in_love_with_san_francisco/,

When the season started I didn't understood the rules and I didn't had a team to support (I only decided I didn't want to support the Yankees). Due to the time difference between Europe and the US most games are very late at night here but whenever I could I would watch them. 

I quickly fell in love with the game and with time I started to support the Giants. I loved to watch Cain, Posey, Melky and Pagan play and every time I could I would watch the games. I became a huge fan of the Giants. And now they're in the world series! My first MLB season and my team in the world series!!!

While in the Mission District, a man ran up behind my friend and pushed her into a bonfire. She has 3rd degree burns on her left side, hands, and feet. She doesn't have health insurance and requires skin grafts.

so, here's our new design. a few things worth noting:

1. the search bar is up in the header
2. the submit link is up in the header -- right below it
3. the rules are not fewer, just condensed. mods and subscribers would appreciate that you read them if you haven't. (thanks.)

overall, the sub should work as usual. large efforts have been made to insure that you won't have any hassles. 

THAT SAID, Reddit Enhancement Suite has been a proper b*tch to work with and I've done my best to solve all the bugs brought to me. There is at least one that I have not been able to solve (and even the RES developer admits it's not  a perfect system.) so, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, if you're seeing an issue LOOK HERE AND SEE IF ANYONE HAS SEEN IT ALSO -- and add any details you can. if you can upload a screenshhot of the problem to imgur.com that would be fantastically useful. it would also help to know if you're on Windows or Mac, what browser you're using and what version. I will try very hard to fix bugs but so far I have had no CSS helpers step forward so my plate's pretty full...

hope you like the new design. we have some more ideas in the hopper.

oh, and if you hate the new design, please go easy on the criticism. I've really put a lot of hours (you'd be surprised) into this and I'm fairly thin-skinned at the moment. patience and constructive criticism appreciated...

thanks to Jack for putting together our bitching new FAQ (link is in the ""rules of conduct"" area of the sidebar) and to all the help from the mod team. also, big thanks to my beta testers for their feedback!

I think that covers it.


EDIT: let's post bugs here -- just please try to tack on your info to the already reported bug. thanks!

EDIT #2: thanks to everyone who has responded with bugs so far. hopefully the big ones have been crushed for all of you -- but keep them coming. I'll do my best to respond in a timely manner. I've also gotten some great constructive criticism... more on that later. but feel free to chime in on any thoughts like that here. 

EDIT #3: it's 5:502p and the game recently started. other than one HORRIFIC bug that I haven't been able to replicate I think the remaining issues are sufferable for the time being. gonna take a bike ride, listen to the game, and get some brain relief. hopefully there won't be any emergencies in my wake.",,False,,t5_2s5xr,1344041606.0,,2nums,True,t3_xn6iy,http://www.reddit.com/r/SFGiants/comments/xn6iy/about_our_new_design/,

The first idea was to have our own awards which would most likely consist of:

MVP

Best Game

Best Play

Best Post

Best Comment

An additional idea created by the mod team was perhaps we do our own IAMAs if anyone is interested in hearing us talk about ourselves.

The voting/submission process for the /r/sfg awards will most likely come in the next monthish. 

IAMAs will be done whenever if people want us to do them.

You are getting my favorite baseball player ever. I'm still trying to gather my thoughts here. We've been expecting this trade all year but it's still a shock. Quite frankly, I want to cry.

He's the 2nd best position player the Mets have ever had, period. One can even argue the best. He will hit you doubles every night, give you the best at bats you'll see from anyone in baseball, walk a ton, play incredible defense to boot (he can still play center, right-field has been a joke for him all year) but most importantly, get the big fucking hit. His career with the Mets has been viewed in a really ridiculous way - the final out of the 2006 NLCS. What idiot Met fans wont tell you is that he should have won MVP that year (at the very least 2nd to Pujols) and was far and above the best player for the Mets. 

I will be rooting for you guys more than I have ever rooted for another team. As long as you have Carlos, we're all Giants. LETS FUCKING GO GIANTS! TAKE ANOTHER FUCKING WORLD SERIES AND SHOW THESE MOTHERFUCKING PHILLIE ASSHOLES WHAT IT REALLY IS! 

**I LOVED YOU LIKE A FATHER, CARLOS. IT'S TIME TO MOVE ON TO GREENER PASTURES. TO THE DEFENDING WORLD CHAMPIONS, GOOD LUCK! LETS GO!!!!!!!!!!!**",,False,,t5_2s5xr,False,,,True,t3_j1gbu,http://www.reddit.com/r/SFGiants/comments/j1gbu/a_message_about_beltran_from_the_head_mod_of/,

As a part of their ~~""alcohol management plan""~~ extreme profit making plan stadiums and beer companies such as, Bud, Miller/Coors, and Heineken have watered down their normal golden goodness without any notice to the consumer. Go ahead, take a look at those aluminum bottles and tell me if they say anything pertaining to alcohol content?

Fear not, there is a solution. Our wonderful stadium has a top notch selection of premium, mostly local, craft beers. For an extra 50 cents (they already have 9 and a quarter of your hard earned dollars) you can enjoy a Sierra Nevada[(5.7%)](http://www.realbeer.com/edu/health/calories.php), Anchor Steam(4.9%), or Lagunitas(6.2%) to name a few. 
 
I am not a crazy drunk nor do I work for any of the companies mentioned above, I just find this type of corporate douchbaggery infuriating. If they are going to charge 8 times as much(that's an issue for a different day) they should not be giving us a inferior product. Bottom line, if you like drinking  tangy alcohol flavored apple juice and visiting the bathroom innings 4-9 go right ahead and kick back those buds. If you like spending money on worthwhile products and enjoy the enhancement beer provides to baseball then please join me in never buying another Bud, Coors, or Heineken at the stadium again. Thank you.

**edit:** I don't have a hard source that this is happening at At&amp;t but the general consensus seems to be something is off with the beer. That combined with the fact that other teams in baseball do participate in this seems to make a convincing case. Maybe we should have a vote?

""Saturday's national broadcast of the Philadelphia Phillies hosting the SF Giants was one of the most unprofessional, appalling baseball games I've watched in my life. I am a life-long baseball fan and subscriber to MLB Extra Innings, so I consider myself a cultured &amp; unbiased baseball romantic who knows a good broadcast when I hear one. To start, you paired Tom McCarthy, their everyday play by play announcer, with ex-Philly, homer hot-head Mitch Williams (who famously predicted the Phillies to sweep the Giants in the 2010 NLCS). The entire broadcast was a love-fest and sob story about the Phillies travails/injuries of the 2012 season. Every single hit by the Phillies was evangelized as if it were division clinching while all Giants highlights were swept under the rug or ignored via Ken Rosenthal interview, having no relevance whatsoever. The East Coast Bias was prevalent &amp; palpable. Bring in the righty because Mitch Williams ought to be pulled. His homerism is obnoxious.""

TOP EDIT: [Meetup this Friday](http://www.reddit.com/r/SFGiants/comments/vpuo1/have_a_beer_with_us_rsfgiants_this_friday/)

So it’s been a few days since my last update. It’s not because I’ve gone into hiding or anything like that, it’s just been crazy for me these past few days. So here goes - my final, albeit overdue, update on the Monday Giants vs Dodgers game!



So, after posting here a little while back, I got a lot of really great replies from a bunch of you guys on everything from what to wear, where to sit and what to eat and drink. I’d like you to know that I considered everything you guys suggested - and I think what I ended up with was ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!



I was really looking forward to the game, it was actually the thing I was looking forward to the most for my entire trip. Please understand that I’m in SF to attend a conference, but this has completely twisted my focus for my trip (I’m attending Google IO this year, if anyone is wondering). The game was everything I could think about, I read about baseball up front, I tried to figure out what game to go to on my own - but ended up getting a greater understanding from you guys than anything I could find online - I asked around first thing when I arrived at the airport. I did as much as I possibly could to further enhance my experience.



Being a tourist I went to Pier 39, and there is this shop there that sell gear - and I went with the jacket and the cap. I’m sure some of you have noticed that...! I’ve also decided to get a full game suit for my 10 year old son, and I’ll probably bring home a bat, a glove and a few balls too.



Also, a bit of information that might intrest you - baseball doesn’t exist in Norway. At all. It is completely absent as a sport. All that I know about baseball I know from TV. To us, this is the most American thing there is.



Anyway - game night is here. I met up wit sfbayareagirl - who was nice enough to join me for the game - just outside of the Willie Mays gate. I was there just after 5:30, in good time, just as you suggested. And I’m glad I did - I toured the entire stadium, got a Norwegian priced beer from the open bar behind the bleachers, got my garlic fries and was feeling psyched for the game.



Cap on, jacked zipped up, blanket over my knees - I’m ready!



I was on section 127, #1 row, seat 10. It was like being on the field itself. I couldn’t imagine it being this close up to the field and the action. I got to see the warmups, feel the mood climbing amongst the still emerging crowds and talking to everyone around me. The way americans are to complete strangers is very different from what I’m used to from Norway. We’re a very quiet and isolated people - we don’t usually talk to people we don’t know, we rarely cheer and it’s completely frowned upon to shout at games. You guys would hate going to a soccer game in Norway ;-)



After the warmup, the game started. Now, I haven’t seen any real games before. It simply isn’t possible in Norway. Whatever I have seen, is completely different from what you see from the seat anyway.



I was surprised by the amount of balls that ended up in the audience - and one ball landed between 127 and 128 at my row. Sadly, I was just getting more beer at that time, but what happened was that four people was struggling to get the ball. It ended up in the hands of the guy sitting four seats to my left. Being a good guy, he gave the ball to some kid - which is very commendable. The thing he didn’t consider, though, was that the Dodgers-fan sitting two seats away from me wanted the ball. Badly. He ended up buying the ball from the kid for $100... Bet the guy that got the ball felt like crap about that one. This episode didn’t exactly make me feel bad about being a Born Again Giants Fan(tm) and not a neutral or Dodgers fan. (the same Dodgers fan that bombed the old dude doing the silly dance on the big screen by the way)



You all know how the game ended, and I won’t go into specifics about that - you know what happened way more than I did anyway. But at the two last innings I really felt like I understood the game and what was at stake. The big zero was hard to miss on the billboard, and meeting your biggest rivals and completely crushing them with an unstable pitcher - well, let’s just say that I felt like one of you guys at that moment. I can easily relate to that on so many levels.



The game was incredibly exciting for me, it was completely different than I had imagined and I hadn’t in my wildest dreams thought I would enjoy it as much as I did.



Coming back to the hotel and reading all the comments and reliving the game again was great.



The day after I was at a pre-party for the conference, and I was not able to enjoy myself. I ended up going down to the stadium again and tried getting tickets. It was late and the game was over half done, so I decided against buying a $100 ticket for the last four innings. I don’t regret that decision though, I got to see the game from Public House instead, and that in itself was an experience I will cherish. After the game I placed myself behind the outside ad-hoc TV studio, cheering and shouting BEAT LA as loud as I could. So if anyone of you watched the post game broadcast, you probably saw me there without knowing.



I’d like to extend my biggest gratitude to you guys. You’ve taken me under your wing and made me feel like one of you. Seeing all the crazy variations of my “doing it right”-post has been a blast. I’ve sent the screenshots to my family in Norway and they’ve probably had their share of laughs about it too :-)



I was going to the game to experience something American, and what I got was something much, much more. I got to experience the Giants, beating their biggest rivals, the sense of community at /r/sfgiants - and most importantly - I became a fan. 



I’m here till July 3rd, busy busy busy until Friday afternoon, but free to do stuff after 4pm on Friday, after 6pm on Saturday, all of Sunday and all of Monday. I’d love to meet some of you guys, and I hope that I can continue being a part of /r/sfgiants. I can be reached at 415-702-5790.



THANK YOU!!

I'm a current South Carolina resident who was born and raised in the bay area, and since moving about 5 years ago, it's been a dark and lonely world in terms of sports cheering. Everyone here is a Braves fan...they actually taunted and jeered me last year when Posey got injured. But the fact that there are people online that I can communicate with and that are so passionate and devoted to the team that I've loved growing up is amazing. 

This entire season, I've been able to come on and read legitimate, non mlb.com forum discussions between fellow Giants fans about the team...and we can relate feelings, vent frustration, cheer for the amazing clutchness of our players, and more. I remember watching Matt Cain's perfect game on mlb.tv at 1am (time difference!) and being able to bask in the glory of it with people here. It's great.

So thank you everyone for an amazing season so far, and especially thank you to the guy who does the stream, because whenever the Giants play the Braves, the game is blacked out on mlb.tv.

And on a final note, Beat LA!",,False,,t5_2s5xr,False,,2nums,True,t3_zmik7,http://www.reddit.com/r/SFGiants/comments/zmik7/how_thankful_i_am_for_this_community/,

I am sorely disappointed in last night's Gameday Thread. There was overwhelming negativity about the team, the coaching staff, and individual players. Look guys, I know how frustrating it is to be here as do all Giants fans who have followed the team for more than the past 3 years. June Swoon SUCKS. It does. But that is no excuse to attack players like Crawford who have played their career best up to this point and who only played tonight because Arias got hurt. So what about someone who hasn't played up to snuff like Kontos? Think about our bullpen options right now. Casilla hurt, Romo being kept alive for the potential save, Dunning and Rosario untested arms, Lopez needed for a tough LH out, Gaudin a starter (and hurt), and Kontos just called up from the minors with something to prove. You really think there was a better option for Bochy to use? That is why Kontos is on the team right now, and as such he deserves our support. Just like Cody Ross, Aubrey Huff, Marco Scutaro, and Hunter Pence who were all a bunch of OK players until they got hot and won us 2 World Series Titles (Hell yeah). Give Kontos some time to work with Righetti. Affeldt hadn't been clutch until last year when he was instrumental in our Championship season (Again, hell yeah)! I can't believe I have to say this but, a huge part of being a Giants fan is SUPPORTING THE TEAM! Yes, that means when we're losing. Focus on the goods of last night: Bumgarner threw an absolute gem, Crawford and Scutaro looked slick up the middle, we collected 8 hits, and it took a rookie hitting .448 to carry the trolley dodgers to an 8th inning victory. That's still a tough loss, but really a huge improvement over those old 12-8 games whether we won them or lost them. We thrive on close games. We get one clutch hit, one more call goes our way, and that game was still tied. These things happen in baseball. Remember Blanco's bunt in the WS that stayed fair? Breaks go both ways. We WILL get bats back into our lineup and arms into our pen as people get healthy again. Just got to ride it out and support the team in a positive way. Please. It is so much more fun to read intelligent commentary on the game than the ""Fuck Kontos/Crawford/Bochy/umpires""-fest of last night.

And even IF the Dodgers sweep us tonight, we still have a 5-4 lead on them for the season series. Another fun fact, if you think this sweep is painful, remember when we skunked them last year at AT&amp;T? Zero runs scored. Think about that should you cry yourself to sleep.

2. We're not watch the San Francisco Giants. Last night we saw the Dodgers beat Mike Kickham. Then we saw Jake Dunning throw a pick-off into right field with the Stephen Fife at the plate. Then we saw Juan Perez fail to get a bunt down with runners on 1st &amp; 2nd with no outs. Again, we are watching a pseudo-Fresno Grizzlies team. We need Santiago Casilla back.

Since he can't travel, and we really can't afford to send him to a game anyway, I was wondering if anybody thinking about attending Giants game batting practice before the game could try and get a Giants player to record a videomessage to Martín and send it to him. Something along the lines of ""Hi Martín Sanchez, I'm Matt Cain and thanks for being an awesome fan"". Something like that. Edit: Or a sign saying Thanks Martin or something.

It would mean a lot to him. Message me if you can do something.

Edit: My email is jdangdeals@gmail.com,

1369422619.0,61,self.SFGiants,1ezkoj,How To Get Great Seats and How To Get an Autograph,aardvarkarmorer,66,5,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/SFGiants/comments/1ezkoj/how_to_get_great_seats_and_how_to_get_an_autograph/,"So you want nice seats?

I’m going to tell you how to get great seats to a Giants game for cheap.  Cheap in this context means $50-$75 per seat for something in field club or premium field club. That’s not chump change, but it’s certainly less than the $150 + fees the ticket might cost on the Giant’s website. If you want to do it this way, you’ll need to be flexible, quick and a little bit adventurous.

The single most important thing for getting a good price on tickets is picking the right day. That means a good day of the week, and the right team. I work every weekend, so I go to Monday and Tuesday night games anyway. Tuesday will generally get you the single best prices, then Monday, then Wednesday day games and Thursday night games are pretty close. The team they’re playing is important too. Division teams (except the Dodgers of course) are the best. You’re going to pay a premium for the A’s, Yankees, Red Sox and other super popular teams. Doesn’t mean it’s impossible, I’ve seen great deals even against the Phillies. So, look at the Giants schedule and pick a day that’s not a major holiday and not against one of those teams.

Next, you need to be well informed about the seats. We’re going to be buying tickets largely off of Stubhub, so pick a day and zoom way in. That way you can see individual rows. But, you have to keep in mind that their map is not an exact representation. What I like to do is look at their map and this picture: http://anotherheader.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/dsc_9797.jpg to get a true representation.

A little about different seats: Field Club and Premium Field Club are the same thing. Premium Field Club is just anything row E or closer. There’s no barrier or anything. So a row F seat can be a great deal since it will show up as just regular field club.

The Lexus Dugout Club are the front row seats, and most of them are lowered, except the ones in 115. Frankly, I think they’re too low and wouldn’t spend the money on them unless they were 115 (which is higher) or 119 row AAA (right next to the on deck circle). The “Batter’s Box” is just the center section of 115 and is usually sold as a group.

Row AA seats anywhere are going to be freaking amazing. They’re usually their own tiny private row. 121 and 122 have a great view near the dugout and are unobstructed by the net.

I don’t have as much to say about Club Level except I think it’s great. It’s got a great view and great amenities. You can also save a good amount if you don’t get caught in the “right behind home plate” mentality. I like being between home and first on Club Level.

Ok, you have a decent feel for the seats by now. On to buying the tickets. You’re not going to even look for tickets until the day before the game. Make a Stub Hub account if you don’t already have one, so you can buy tickets quickly. Don’t use their price alert feature, it’s too slow. Pick one type of ticket that you’re interested in (Premium Field Club, Field Club and Club Level) and sort by price. Right now, you’re just trying to get a base line. But, if you see something amazing, go ahead and get it. You should know what all the symbols next to a ticket mean. The ones you’re looking for are isle and parking pass. If you need a parking pass, getting it with your tickets can be a great deal. They’re $35 from the Giants.

There are four times to look for tickets for a 7:15pm game: anytime the day before, 8-10am, 12-2p, and 90 to 30 minutes before the game. That might sound like I’m just listing the whole day, but you’ll see tickets come in “waves”. A lot of people list them around lunch when they realize they can’t go. The 90 to 30 range is where you’ll find the best deals. I once saw 4 tickets in PFC 121 for $35 each. It’s rare for anything to come up closer than 30 minutes, though.

To give you an idea on price, I expect to pay $57 for something in FC and $79 for something in PFC.

If you buy your tickets last minute, there are places at the park you can print them out. In a jam, I believe a ticket taker can even enter them manually if you can pull them up on a smart phone.

The other option is Craiglist. For that, only use paypal. Never buy hard tickets for cash from someone you don’t know. Ever. Seriously. Paypal is good because people know you can charge back. Make a My Tickets account http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/sf/ticketing/mysftickets.jsp and once you get tickets, enter them in. They don’t necessarily have to relay them. This will just let you “claim” them.

How do you find the tickets on Craigslist? I have bookmarks for a bunch of searches in a folder in Chrome. I middle click and they all open as new tabs. I search for Giants AA, BB, CC, AAA, BBB, CCC and Field Club. Those are all the nicest rows. It takes me less than a minute to look over everything. A lot people try to overcharge on CL and you can usually find a better deal on Stub Hub. But all you need is that one listing. That’s how I got my last tickets.

That’s basically it. The single best thing to do is practice once. Pick a day that you’re not going, but pretend you are.
