It ended up a delicious, light biscuit-like food. Super easy to make, just takes a little waiting time.

Makes a lot of bread. Probably 6-8 servings.

Ingredients:

2.5 cu flour

.5 tsp baking soda

.5 tsp baking powder

1 tsp salt

1 tbl ground cumin

1 tsp sugar

1 egg

1 cu milk

.5 cu yogurt

1 tbl vegetable oil + oil to cook in

To make:

Mix together the dry ingredients. Add the yogurt, milk, mixed egg, and oil and stir. It will be quite thick. You can add more milk to thin it if you like. Let it sit and come together for about 10-20 minutes. 

Heat a frying pan over *low* heat. This is key.

Put oil in the pan and spoon the dough in, frying over low heat. When golden brown on the bottom flip and fry on the other side. It will poof up and get rather thick, but delicious!

Eat!

It is very good warm with a bit of butter. Would be good with strawberries and cream as a shortcake. Would be good with chilli. It's just basically good.

I know it's not traditional Naan. It's not like anything I've ever had, but it is really good and I wanted to share. Enjoy!",,False,self,t5_2u446,False,,,True,t3_xa801,http://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/xa801/pan_naan_biscuits/,

So I got a slow cooker as a wedding gift. I'm dying to make some homemade pulled pork in it, and I wanted to make my own bbq sauce, because I hate using store bought stuff. It feels like cheating. Anyway, I've been perusing the internet for BBQ sauce recipes, and I've got a starting point, but I'm not sure where to go from there. Here's what I've figured that I need for basics:

* Tomato paste/Ketchup 
* Brown sugar
* Something for onion flavour, whether it's an onion or onion powder
* Mustard
* Something for heat

I see a lot of recipes that call for apple cider vinegar, too. I was wondering if anyone's had any experience with making bbq sauce, and what the cider vinegar might add. I'm also thinking of integrating sriracha into the mix.

Any ideas why?

I've discovered you the other day, and I think this subreddit has great potential. I've recently tried my hands on making [fries](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/05/perfect-french-fries-recipe.html) with [mayo](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/23/dining/easy-homemade-mayonnaise.html?pagewanted=all) fromscratch, with great success if I may say so myself (I'll post those links in a sec). Today I've made tagliatelle for the first time. They were a bit too thick, but I digress. The point is, I'm currently discovering that a lot of things I used to buy readymade in the supermarket are fun and surprisingly easy to do myself. And that's why I'm very happy that this subreddit exists and looking forward to trying many of the things posted here.

What concerns me, though, is that sometimes subreddits are being held back from achieving the greatness they deserve because the focus isn't clear and they risk losing what sets them apart from other, existing large subreddits. Yes, there isn't a lot of traffic in here (yet), but the early posts set the tone.

To finally get to what I mean, do things that are *commonly* being made from scratch qualify, or is the focus on things that most people don't *usually* make fromscratch?

For example, take cakes. It's great what you've all been cooking up, but at least where I'm from, that's just normal [(/r/)baking](http://www.reddit.com/r/baking). There is a lot of overlap with places like /r/breadit and generally /r/cooking in here, where you can reach a much wider audience and get better feedback from people who really know their stuff.  
I know there aren't many posts in here, but as a new subscriber, what's the value this subreddit is addidng for me? Will it just clutter up my subscription list? Or will it be a place that inspires me when I have some time and feel like trying new things on my own?

Sorry if this is coming across the wrong way, I know I'm the new guy and haven't added anything of value yet myself. I just really like the idea of this subreddit, at least the way I understood it.

So, what does everybody think?",,False,self,t5_2u446,False,,,True,t3_v623f,http://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/v623f/question_about_the_focus_of_rfromscratch/,

1 shallot minced finely

1 tablespoon + 1 teaspoon white AP flour

1 teaspoon dry mustard

1/4 teaspoon paprika or cayenne (more zing!)

ground black pepper

salt

~1.5 cups of hot scalded milk (microwave is fine)

1 cup shredded medium or sharp Cheddar cheese

2 cups elbow macaroni




Grate cheese and scald milk. Mix 1 teaspoon flour, pepper, paprika and mustard powder into grated cheese.

Add 1 teaspoon salt to 4 quarts of water and bring to a boil in a large pot. Cook macaroni to slightly firmer than al dente.

Meanwhile, in a medium pot melt butter on medium heat. Add diced shallot and cook until shallot is fragrant and translucent. Add tablespoon of flour and incorporate well. Add half of milk and stir. Add remainder of milk. Continue stirring while sauce thickens and begins to bubble. Add cheese and spices mixture a quarter at a time stirring with each incorporation. Continue cooking until bubbly and hot. Do not allow to boil! Adjust salt.

Drain pasta reserving a quarter cup of liquid.

Add pasta to sauce. Mix sauce and pasta thoroughly. If sauce is too thick add reserved boiling liquid. Cook pasta and sauce for several minutes until bubbling slightly. 

Serve!

Makes 4 cups, about 3-4 portions as a side dish or 1-2 main course.

By far my favourite part of making mac &amp; cheese is mixing it up with variations.

Accompaniments/Variations (most are added right at end)

* Use bowties, rotini, penne, rigatoni, small shells instead of macaroni
* 1 tablespoon chili powder to spice mix. Nachotastic!
* Double the amount of cheese 
* Replace half of scalded milk with porter or stout. Guinness is a good choice. 
* half cup diced ham
* half cup diced bacon
* 2 diced hot dogs added to pasta 1-2 minutes before draining
* 1 cup frozen veggies green peas or corn added to pasta 3-4 minutes before draining
* half cup of diced chicken breast
* 2 tablespoons green onion
* 1 tablespoon of tomato sauce or paste
* quarter cup diced bell pepper
* canned Green chillies
* black olives
* roasted bell peppers
* 1 tablespoon BBQ sauce or chili sauce.
* truffle oil or shaved black truffles
* leeks, garlic or onion instead of shallots
* 1 tablespoon Sri racha (rooster sauce) or sambal olek
* 1 egg whipped, add after combining sauce and noodles.
* 1 cup sauteed sliced mushrooms
* 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese in addition to cheddar
* replace Cheddar with Gruyère
* use white Cheddar (works best with white pepper)
* several drops of liquid smoke added to sauce
* add cubes of smoked gouda, mozerella or fontina after mixing sauce and noodles
* add crushed potato chips, dry bread crumbs, butter sauteed bread crumbs, or additional grated cheese on top and bake to melt cheese.

But even cooking from scratch, we can find shortcuts to make things easier.

For example, when I was baking bread regularly, I would weigh out the dry ingredients for 4 or 5 loaves at a time and store them in airtight containers.  When it was time to make dough, all I'd need to do is dump the ingredients in the bread machine and then add yeast and water. 

Similarly, although I rarely bake in a bread machine, I use it to make almost all my doughs because it's easy, it's gentle, and it's very thorough.  No tending it, no mixer parts, it just works.

Using a stick blender for puréeing in the pan seems obvious, but I use mine with a small jar for most small ""put these things in a blender or food processor"" tasks, especially salad dressings.

Fresh pasta always sounds daunting and messy but with the right preparation and ingredients it is quick and easy and always worthwhile. My recipe is a slight adaptation of [Bob's Red Mill semolina pasta recipe](http://www.bobsredmill.com/images/Q/1495C24_b_hr.jpg).

* Basic Ingredients:

1.5 cups Semolina flour

.5 cup AP flour (AP seems to 'glue' the semolina together)

Two Large Eggs

2 TB Water

2 TB Oil

Quarter tsp salt

* Optional Ingredients:

Spices- preferably powdered or finely ground, large pieces can tear or hinder cutting the pasta.

Flavored Oils - Truffle oil works really well (MylesMDT mentioned basil oil, roasted garlic oil, roasted red pepper oil etc. These are great examples of how versatile pasta flavoring can be. Experiment and find what you like.)

Flavored Liquids in place of water- Soy sauce 

Herbs- fresh or dried, your preference.

Misc- prepared horseradish, squid ink, mushroom juice, bacon fat, almost anything. Pasta is so versatile and super cheap to make from scratch, experimenting with flavors is the best practice to becoming a great pasta maker. 

* Preparation:

1. In a large mixing bowl, combine one cup semolina, a half cup AP flour, salt and any dry optional ingredients. Mix thoroughly and evenly, and form a well in the middle.

2. In another small mixing bowl, whisk eggs, water, oil and any moist or liquid optional ingredients. Beat until frothy and well combined.

3. Pour egg mix into well of flour mix. Fold mixture until combined and start adding the other half cup of semolina until a stiff dough forms. 

4. Knead for five to ten minutes. Let rest for twenty.

5. If using a pasta machine, tear dough into managable size balls and knead a few more times before forming a log and feeding through the machine until your desired thickness. (I like #5 on the pasta machine.) If using a rolling pin, lightly flour the dough and rolling surface and gradually roll to your desired thickness. Adding flour as needed.

6. Cut the pasta in your favorite style and hang it to dry while you work on the rest of the dough. Hang on string, the back of a chair, coat hangers or anything else. Also try to gently separate the strands of pasta to avoid clumping while cooking.

7. Boil the pasta, in batches, in heavily salted water for two or three minutes, pair with a light sauce and enjoy.",,False,self,t5_2u446,1337780895.0,,,True,t3_tznci,http://www.reddit.com/r/fromscratch/comments/tznci/fresh_pasta/,

Do this:

Boil some potatoes for mashed potatoes. Reserve the water (about a cup worth). Cook whatever meat-type-thing you want to eat in a pan.

After removing the meat you make the gravy.

Put 2 knobs of butter in the pan you cooked the meat in and wait for it to heat up. Put 2 tablespoons of flour in the pan and stir it around until evenly coated.

Let the flour cook in the pan for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. The flour will begin to turn brown.

Take that good starchy water from the potatoes and toss it in the pan, stirring wildly. Add milk and continue to stir until it is the right thickness for you.

Done! It was so good. We made chicken gravy after pan-frying chicken coated in buttermilk, cornflour, and breadcrumbs. Some of the drippings were still in the pan, which added a little crunch to the gravy.

We make cheese and sell it to shareholders through a local co-op as well as at a farmer's market. We also have a large garden that supplies most of our fresh vegetables. There's an opportunity to volunteer at the co-op too on your days off, which can be a lot of fun. 

We also make salad dressings, kombucha, kimchi, salsa, pickles and all sorts of things from scratch here.    

Some of your duties would be learning how to herd the goats out into the surrounding forested canyons and BLM land, making all kinds of yummy cheeses, and tending to the garden. 

We are all really into food here, so expect to eat awesome meals. If you love to cook, you'll do very well here! 

There is one full-time person here, as well as two wwoofers that are here for the season (I am one of them). We are 27 and 30 years old, and the full-time person is a super awesome 61 year old lady who works harder than all of us put together. Someone just recently left, and we need one more person to balance out the work load. 

The requirements are 20-25 hours a week, and there is a small stipend offered. Most of the chores are completed in the morning, and we have a huge chunk of the day to ourselves to read, write, hike, relax. 

There is wireless internet that is run off of solar panels, so you won't be completely out of touch! You could stay in the yurt, or sleep in a tent; it's up to you! You could even sleep outside in just your sleeping bag. 

Thanks for reading!

Place a wide pan over medium heat, and toast the cumin and coriander for about 5 minutes, or until the seeds start to just change color and become aromatic.

In a coffee grinder, place the toasted cumin and coriander and the whole clove and blend until it becomes a fine powder.

Combine the freshly ground cumin, coriander, and cloves with turmeric, cinnamon, cardamom, and cayenne pepper in an airtight container.

I cook a lot, and when cooking from scratch I often make a call as to which ingredients in a dish I should make from scratch and which I shouldn't. For example, if I make a pizza crust from scratch, I may use jarred sauce. Obviously we all do this to an extent (I doubt there are many who stretch their own mozzarella for pizza making, but I could be wrong.) Conversely, if I'm making a big batch of homemade pasta sauce, I may not think it's worth it to set the dough rising at the same time.

This is important because making one aspect of a dish from scratch can be time consuming and really elevate the other storebought ingredients.

I'm not trying to be pretentious but I find it harsh that people that haven't heard of pre-made canned biscuits are being a) downvoted in the thread, b) downvoted and berated because of ancedotes. I've never heard of them in my life, and I doubt I'd even want to use something like ""pre-made canned biscuits"" in any of my recipes.

Rant over.
