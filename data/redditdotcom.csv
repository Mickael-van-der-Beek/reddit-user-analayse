All of those $4 payments spent on gilding comments could have been spent better on helping the victims of this senseless tragedy, rather than giving some comments gold stars. I implore Reddit do its part in helping the victims and donate the money they gained from this tragedy to the American Red Cross.

In addition to helping the victims of this tragedy, a large donation from Reddit would increase goodwill, both among Redditors and non-Redditors. Reddit will gain positive media attention outside of Reddit for their charitable deeds. This will lead to more people becoming proud Redditors, through either joining the site or becoming more involved in the community.

Many of those feeds resulted in Reddit submissions because it was easy to peruse my list of feeds, see something to share, and post it.  Now that Reader is going away... getting new content for Reddit is going to be a much more manual process for me.  

Wouldn't it be great if there was a new type of subreddit that could act as an RSS subscription/subreddit.  The creation process of the new subreddit would require a valid RSS url.  Once created, as new articles were submitted to the RSS feed, they would appear as new submissions for that subreddit.  Users could then up/down vote as always adding more value to that RSS feed.

Of course this would also drive ex-Google-Reader users to Reddit once it is officially decommissioned.  Reader users would instead subscribe to (or create) all of their favorite RSS feeds and read them in Reddit.

What would be the effort to add this feature to Reddit?

1358821558.0,3,self.redditdotcom,1712ym,"Help, Reddit. How do I get this guy to learn his email address and stop sending stuff to me?",CrazyDwarf,7,4,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/redditdotcom/comments/1712ym/help_reddit_how_do_i_get_this_guy_to_learn_his/,"Help! For years now I have been getting email intended for a ""Michael Rodman"". About 6 months ago I figured out who they were intended for because HE (yes, he did this himself) CC'ed me in a message he sent in response to an ad on Craig's list.

I emailed him then and got no response. Since then, I have continued to get email intended for him, and he has continued to CC me on email he was sending. I've gotten all kinds of information about his gym, his divorce, his niece's wedding, and his job. A few weeks ago, his niece (who works at Neiman Marcus) emailed me thanking me for the wedding gift and telling me about a potential job. Of course I replied asking for information about the job. She then emailed the person with the job and CC'ed me. I replied to them with this:

*I am not your uncle (as far as I know) and have never worked jewelry sales. I have tried repeatedly to get &lt;his email address&gt; to stop CCing me on emails to his divorce attorney and to correct wherever it is that he has published this to be his email address. This is not his address. I am not he.*

*If he gave you this email address, I would not hire him to work for me as if he is incapable of giving out his own email address correctly (or typing in his own email address in the CC field of an email), how can he be trusted to handle any business interactions appropriately.*

*I have been getting email intended for him for years and have just discovered in the past six months who he is. I have tried to get him to correct this problem, but so far he has not so much as replied to acknowledge his error. I am not interested in his Gym membership, his legal communications, his domestic issues or his job.*

*Please notify him that this is NOT his email address and perhaps buy him some classes where they teach him how to use email and how email addresses work.*

*Thank you, and have a nice day.*

*PS. My wife said she would accept free stuff from Neiman Marcus or Tiffany's in compensation for the headache this has caused us.*

All was quiet for a couple of weeks. Then today I got an email from AT&amp;T regarding an order the OTHER Michael Rodman in Chicago made. Yes, he still hasn't learned his email address and is ordering ATT Uverse, complete with a Motorola NVG510. I called AT&amp;T thinking they could look up the account number (124261040) and maybe call the guy to let him know he's ... challenged.

They can't find the account. I gave them that number (above) and the tracking numbers from the email THEY sent me (1ZA2024X0222974554 AND 1ZA2024X0222974554). They still can't find the account or the order.

In my attempt to contact ATT, I was disconnected twice, and transferred once. The last person was quiet for 2 minutes when I asked, ""Did I get disconnected again?"" She actually replied, ""Yes."" But I heard her, so I know she's a liar now. I had her on speaker and my wife agrees she couldn't have been joking. Should I trust that the case id (cm20130121_58516799) she opened for me is real? 

Can you help me find this guy? He won't reply when I email him and he keeps using my email address.",,False,,t5_2rqn5,1358823468.0,,,True,t3_1712ym,http://www.reddit.com/r/redditdotcom/comments/1712ym/help_reddit_how_do_i_get_this_guy_to_learn_his/,

Here are some tips which should help make your visit quite a pleasant one:

-Smile and make eye contact with your waiter. We appreciate it. Seriously.

-Don't make a complicated order on drinks or food.

-Order a bottle of wine as opposed to a glass. This allows you to drink at your own pace.

-Don't order everything at one time. It WILL NOT make your meal come out any faster.

-BE PATIENT. Your favorite place will have a kitchen that will be overloaded with tickets. Food will take longer than usual to arrive.

-If you're unsure of a price, ask. That way, there won't be any grumbles when the check arrives.

-Once you've finished eating and have paid, please leave so that the people who have been waiting for 40 minutes for a table have a chance to enjoy their night as well.

-And last, but not least, tip well if you ordered a ton of stuff and the waiter kept up with everything in a pleasant demeanor. Most of us only make $2.13/hr and have to tip out 5% of our sales. (Example: let's say you only tip $10 on your $100 tab. After our 5% tip-out, we only make $5).

Thanks for reading, and I hope (if you're going out that night) that I helped you enjoy your evening!",,False,,t5_2rqn5,False,,,True,t3_18f03m,http://www.reddit.com/r/redditdotcom/comments/18f03m/valentines_day_dining_out_suggestions_and_tips/,

Years later, I realized how hard I was friendzoned.",epring,9,10,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/redditdotcom/comments/1fg3d8/in_high_school_my_best_girl_friend_who_i_was_in/,"This is a tribute to the nice guys. The nice guys that finish last, that never become more than friends, that endure hours of whining and bitching about what assholes guys are, while disproving the very point. This is dedicated to those guys who always provide a shoulder to lean on but restrain themselves to tentative hugs, those guys who hold open doors and give reassuring pats on the back and sit patiently outside the changing room at department stores. This is in honor of the guys that obligingly reiterate how cute/beautiful/smart/funny/sexy their female friends are at the appropriate moment, because they know most girls need that litany of support. This is in honor of the guys with open minds, with laid-back attitudes, with honest concern. This is in honor of the guys who respect a girl’s every facet, from her privacy to her theology to her clothing style.
This is for the guys who escort their drunk, bewildered female friends back from parties and never take advantage once they’re at her door, for the guys who accompany girls to bars as buffers against the rest of the creepy male population, for the guys who know a girl is fishing for compliments but give them out anyway, for the guys who always play by the rules in a game where the rules favor cheaters, for the guys who are accredited as boyfriend material but somehow don’t end up being boyfriends, for all the nice guys who are overlooked, underestimated, and unappreciated, for all the nice guys who are manipulated, misled, and unjustly abandoned, this is for you.

This is for that time she left 40 urgent messages on your cell phone, and when you called her back, she spent three hours painstakingly dissecting two sentences her boyfriend said to her over dinner. And even though you thought her boyfriend was a chump and a jerk, you assured her that it was all ok and she shouldn’t worry about it. This is for that time she interrupted the best killing spree you’d ever orchestrated in GTA3 to rant about a rumor that romantically linked her and the guy she thinks is the most repulsive person in the world. And even though you thought it was immature and you had nothing against the guy, you paused the game for two hours and helped her concoct a counter-rumor to spread around the floor. This is also for that time she didn’t have a date, so after numerous vows that there was nothing “serious” between the two of you, she dragged you to a party where you knew nobody, the beer was awful, and she flirted shamelessly with you, justifying each fit of reckless teasing by announcing to everyone: “oh, but we’re just friends!” And even though you were invited purely as a symbolic warm body for her ego, you went anyways. Because you’re nice like that.

The nice guys don’t often get credit where credit is due. And perhaps more disturbing, the nice guys don’t seem to get laid as often as they should. And I wish I could logically explain this trend, but I can’t. From what I have observed on campus and what I have learned from talking to friends at other schools and in the workplace, the only conclusion I can form is that many girls are just illogical, manipulative bitches. Many of them claim they just want to date a nice guy, but when presented with such a specimen, they say irrational, confusing things such as “oh, he’s too nice to date” or “he would be a good boyfriend but he’s not for me” or “he already puts up with so much from me, I couldn’t possibly ask him out!” or the most frustrating of all: “no, it would ruin our friendship.” Yet, they continue to lament the lack of datable men in the world, and they expect their too-nice-to-date male friends to sympathize and apologize for the men that are jerks. Sorry, guys, girls like that are beyond my ability to fathom. I can’t figure out why the connection breaks down between what they say (I want a nice guy!) and what they do (I’m going to sleep with this complete ass now!). But one thing I can do, is say that the nice-guy-finishes-last phenomenon doesn’t last forever. There are definitely many girls who grow out of that train of thought and realize they should be dating the nice guys, not taking them for granted. The tricky part is finding those girls, and even trickier, finding the ones that are single.

So, until those girls are found, I propose a toast to all the nice guys. You know who you are, and I know you’re sick of hearing yourself described as ubiquitously nice. But the truth of the matter is, the world needs your patience in the department store, your holding open of doors, your party escorting services, your propensity to be a sucker for a pretty smile. For all the crazy, inane, absurd things you tolerate, for all the situations where you are the faceless, nameless hero, my accolades, my acknowledgement, and my gratitude go out to you. You do have credibility in this society, and your well deserved vindication is coming.",,False,,t5_2rqn5,False,,,True,t3_1fg3d8,http://www.reddit.com/r/redditdotcom/comments/1fg3d8/in_high_school_my_best_girl_friend_who_i_was_in/,

I am taking part in the Washington state Running Start program, which allows me to take classes at a local community college during my Junior and Senior years of high school for free as long as I keep my grades up. I have loved the experience and have a 3.81 GPA, but with this spring being my last quarter and my free tuition running out, I am trying to transfer to a four year university. My family is just passed the line that renders federal financial aid almost negligible (no grants and only $3,000 in loans out of $20,000-$25,000 total). I am applying to every scholarship I can to help with costs, and I came across this: [www.gotchosen.com/Scholarship](http://www.gotchosen.com/Scholarship.aspx?t=How)

It is a scholarship worth $40,000 over four years, which would pay for at least half of my college education. The problem is that it is a random drawing. However, each applicant can be ""Sponsored"" by other individuals, and each sponsor gives an extra entry into the drawing. I would really appreciate the extra support!

Copypasta instructions from the website:

&gt;Sponsors will also find the process very easy. The first step is to 
&gt;register here, then on the profile page answer the question “who do you want to sponsor?” by entering the email address of the person and hit the “Sponsor!” button.

Anyway, so I want to conduct an experiment to see how quickly I can lose all my comment karma points by deliberately posting comments that other people won't like, without actually violating the rules by being a bully or too offensive or posting inappropriate images of my penis. 

If you think this is a wonderfully fun idea, vote down this post, which will give me a head start. If you think it's a ridiculously stupid idea, vote it up to frustrate me by delaying me achieving my goal of losing all my points. 

Of course, this could just be reverse psychology to cause people who don't like my post to vote it up instead of down, in a sneaky attempt to gain more comments karma points. I'm a bit of a cock like that. 

If I've confused you, just vote down. Or up. It doesn't matter. I can't lose. Or win.

If you are now laughing because you've found this post funny, vote it down, not up, you stupid idiot. Oh dear, I've confused you again, haven't I? It's not hard though is it, because you're so stupid. Look at you, sat there in front of the computer with your stupid face.

If I've just offended you, vote up, because I'll hate that. If you've spotted the reverse psychology, and you really don't like it, you can vote down if you want. But that's what I want you to do?

**My self-summary**

I am an intelligent, bi-sexual, liberal, green-voting, brony Redditor. I am looking for a girl that is smart, attractive, loyal, a little bit clingy, a classy dresser, loves fedoras and Reddit and likes video games. It would be also nice if she could appreciate the subtle nuances and adult references of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, which is my favourite TV show.
What I’m doing with my life
I am currently an aspiring indie game developer, working on my adventure game PonyCraft, in which you try to survive on a island with only Twilight Sparkle (my favourite pony) to help you. I am an expert in 3Ds Max and game design. I am also a bass player in the Chicago based metal band Shadows Bleeding Heart. One day I hope to make games and play in my band for money.
I am currently saving my allowance for a trenchcoat and also a trip to my favourite country Japan.
I’m really good at
Video games, dressing classily, coding games, playing bass
The first things people usually notice about me
The classy way in which I dress. Seriously, not a day goes by when I'm not complimented on how dapper I look in a fedora and cape when compared to all the little kids who have ""swag""
People also notice my dry wit, which is quite famous among some of my crew.
Favorite books, movies, shows, music, and food
Shows: My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic, The Big Bang Theory, How I Met Your Mother (I'm a lot like Barney)
Movies: Blade, Hellboy, Fight Club (I liken myself to Tyler Durden), Donnie Darko
Books: Harry Potter, My Little Pony, Ayn Rand, Nietzsche (anything intelligent or about philosophy)
Music: My Chemical Romance, Linkin Park, Avenged Sevenfold, Alexis on Fire, Suicide Silence, Bring Me The Horizon
Food: Mountain Dew Code Red, Doritos, Hot Pockets, Moms Home Cooking
The six things I could never do without
1. My Fedora
2. Japanese culture
3. My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic
4. I would have added Bioware's space epic ""Mass Effect"", but the ending ruined my life
5. My mom
6. Women...obviously
I spend a lot of time thinking about
My Little Pony, Japan, Video Games, the ending to Mass Effect, girls (obviously), new jokes, Reddit xD
On a typical Friday night I am
Working hard on my game instead of wasting time and money going out like the millions of 18 year old sheeple in Chicago.
The most private thing I’m willing to admit
I'm a virgin and have had plenty of chances to lose it I'm just waiting for the right woman for me (see below)
I’m looking for

    Bi girls only
    Ages 18–40
    Located anywhere
    Who are single
    For long-term dating, short-term dating, casual sex

You should message me if
you're a petite (fake boobs are disgusting), average height (5'1""-5'4""), slim, attractive, intelligent, slightly needy, loyal (I hate sluts) and funny.

You also MUST be a virgin (as I said above I HATE sluts)
