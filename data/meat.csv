I am only limited to long cures as I don't have a curing chamber.

I decided that I wanted my first experience eating meat to be something that I hunted myself so that I could fully appreciate where it came from. I went pheasant hunting with a few friends this weekend, and we butchered the meat ourselves, cooked it, and ate it. It tasted great, I had no negative effects, and I regret nothing. I just tried chicken for the first time tonight, and that was great too. No negative effects there either.

All of this being said- what should I know about meat that you'd assume is common knowledge?

I know that different cuts of meat exist, that people order some meat on a scale of rare to well-done depending on how cooked it is, and that different meats have different fat contents. That's about it. Any information or recommendations on what to try and how it's typically ordered or eaten would be great.

http://www.reddit.com/r/meat/comments/lsypb/meat_club/

About 8 months ago we posted on here looking for help. Why? We wanted to start our own meat club. I wanted to give an update if anyone was wondering what happened (pictures on imgur below):



We learned:

* pan frying
* grilling
* braising
* roasting
* stewing
* making stock
* dry aging
* marinating


Events:

* Had our own ""SausageFest"" at school and sold 60 lbs of sausage
* Took a butcher class, 2.5 hours long with half of a cow carcass
* Won the school cooking competition (incorporating meat into all the dishes)
* Grilled for a Jewish group and learned about Kosher Meat
* We went and learned about KBBQ + customs
* Were written about in our school newspaper and mentioned in the LA times
* Went on a group bonding retreat to Joshua Tree
* Read The Omnivore's Dilemma 

We also got some sweet tanks and made great friends.

**TL;DR: For every one person a cow feeds, you could feed 64 people!**

0. Topic

0. Method: Assumptions, Sources, and Sources of Error

--------------------------------------------------------------

**Topic:**

How accurate is the Vegetarian claim that eating meat makes poor use of land in terms of the amount of food livestock provide to humans?

Cattle will be used to examine this question.

------------------------------------------------------

**Reason for topic:**

People eat meat because meat is tasty and nutritious. However, vegetarians feel that the disadvantages of eating meat outweigh the benefits. One reason given is that raising billions of cows every year is an inefficient use of farmland, fuel, and other resources.

How accurate is this argument, at least in terms of farmland?

--------------------------------------------------

**Results:**

For every one person that is fed on beef, **64** people could have been fed.

This result seems reasonable: Every pound of feed eaten by a cow is used to fuel the billions of biological functions of the animal, only some of which involve putting meat on the body. Thus, most of the calories consumed by the cow (about 98%) never make it to our mouths.

(Edit: Read [comment about milk production] (http://www.reddit.com/r/meat/comments/16b76u/if_a_slaughter_cow_was_never_raised_how_many_more/c7uidxm), which, if correct, gives a better ratio of about 1/7 for dairy cows instead of the 1/64 for slaughter cows.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Method: Assumptions, Sources, and Sources of Error:**

**Assumptions:**

* The sources are accurate enough to give a ballpark estimate.
* Land used to grow cattle-feed can be repurposed to grow food for humans that is of a similar caloric density.
    * In the US, I have heard that cattle-feed is often low-quality food, such as corn that cannot be eaten by humans. However, rice, lentils, beans, wheat, and other staples are more calorie-dense than corn. It may be safe to assume that land yields more calories when used to grow these human staples, rather than when used to grow cattle-feed.
    * If it is true that land could yield more calories when growing human staples, the result of ""9 times more people"" may be much higher in reality. However, this assumption would require much more research, so it will be ignored it for the sake of simplicity.

**Sources:**

You can see my calculations and sources in this [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AiHTUI0FErsndGlsSGl2MEdaU2hHQndGcC15ejhid2c&amp;output=html).

The websites where I got my sources are listed in the ""Sources"" column.

**Sources of Error:**

* My sources come from Google searches, so the data is more than likely not the most accurate. However, my analysis is only a rough estimation, so I feel safe in assuming the data is ""accurate enough"".
* My methods of analysis may be incorrect.
* As mentioned earlier, it might be true that farmland could be used to grow more calorie-dense food is grown in lieu of cattle-feed. If true, the result of ""64 times more people"" may be much higher in reality.

---------------------------------------------------------------

I hope you found this post as interesting to read as I did to research. Thank you. :)

Also, forgive me for not citing sources throughout this post. :p

---------------------------------------------------------------
(Edit: Formatting and wording.)

(Edit: Changed calories cows eat to about 90,000 per day. This seriously influenced the results, but it makes the discussion about milk make more sense. If you find an error, please point it out.)

Recently I had some tuna, then a steak, then a burger, then some bacon and now that life is behind me for good. 15 out of the 22 years of my life I was a vegetarian and I'm so fucking glad I quit, meat is unbelievably good, it was just food like anything else when I was 7 so it made sense to give it up to avoid hurting the cute animals, I had no appreciation at the time and had no meat cravings of any kind for the duration of my vegetarianism. But anyways, a month or two after I've been eating meat and I hadn't told any of my family yet, I'm going to a family get together and one of the first things my little 10 year old cousin asks me is.

""Are you not a vegetarian any more?""

I was pretty shocked, I tell her I'm not and ask how she could have possibly known.

She says to me ""You're smiling"".

Unreal, kids are fucking smart sometimes, I'm glad I didn't go my whole life as a vegetarian.

The following day I stopped in to introduce myself, and the owner seemed pleased and and positive about the whole situation. After some pleasant chatting and some food-nerd relating conversation, he made me an incredible offer.

 The rundown: I go in to [stage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stage_(cooking) one day next week. If the owner feels that I'm a right fit for the shop, I will be employed to work the counter and about 6 months down the road, apprentice. For free (!). Usually he charges big $ for this. I'm giddy as hell. Any tips on how to not blow this opportunity, butchers and chefs? I've had some basic professional prep cooking experience, but no real butchering experience.

We Love Meat.

Myself and a couple of buddies are starting the Meat Club at our school. We love eating meat but want to learn more about the sustainability, ways to cook, and different types of meat. We want to get Meat Tank-tops (looking for designs right now), have a ""sausage fest"" fundraiser, retreat (learning to cook a luau), have a reading list, screen movies.

Questions that we have for you:

* What are the essentials that we need to educate a group of people, including ourselves about meat? Books? Movies? Pictures?
* If you were to start a meat club, what would you do?
* Tell us anything. Any advice you can give is much appreciated.

Sincerely,

MeatClubLovers

this recipe usually lets me make about 15 lbs at a time.

The Recipe:
8 oz worcestershire sauce
8 oz Lemon juice
5 tbsp lawry's season salt
1 tbsp black pepper
2 tbsp garlic powder
1 tsp accent
1 dash of A1 (only a dash)

I let sit for 2-3 days. Grill or smoke. I use hickory chips.

Going to start trying out adding different herbs and oils

Great for making steaks or strips/jerky/bite pieces. When its hot off the grill the smoker o boy it is instant salivating for you. 

if you guys have any other ideas to try let me know. I add/change the ingredients every time i make this.

EDIT: looking around I am finding things I want to try with this.

from u/cdresden to incorporate vinegar and reduce the lemon juice

1346709750.0,11,self.meat,zavsj,Some tips in order to make the perfect burger,Pythov,16,5,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/meat/comments/zavsj/some_tips_in_order_to_make_the_perfect_burger/,"1. Don't Push Down on the Meat
Consider this the cardinal rule of cooking burgers. ""It squeezes out the juices, and the juices are the flavor,"" says Jeff Weinstein, founder and owner of the Counter burger restaurants. ""Would you rather have a juicy product that took an extra minute or a non-juicy product that came a little faster?""

2. Buy Good Meat
Weinstein likes to have his butcher custom grind his meat -- he asks for a sirloin steak or rib-eye with a meat-to-fat ratio between 75-25 and 80-20. Even if you just go to your supermarket's meat section, don't fall for the trap so many people do, assuming the leanest meat is the best. ""It'll be cardboard by the time you're done.""

3. Chill the Meat First
Before you even form the patties, put the meat in the fridge for a half hour or so. You don't want your body heat to melt away the fat as you shape it; getting it colder helps it withstand the treatment. Weinstein even washes his hands in cold water before working with it to reduce their temperature.

4. Use a Scale
Unless you want people griping about unequal treatment, or you have a practiced eye for meat, use a scale to balance even amounts in each burger. Even Weinstein does.

5. Don't Overwork the Meat
People tend to ball up the meat as they form their patties. Don't do that; less handling is better. The more you push down and compress, the tougher the meat will be.

6. Use Both Hands to Form the Perfect Patty
Pull the meat apart into equal pieces, then pat down into a patty on a hard surface with one hand while forming the rough edge with the other. Resist the urge to slam down! Some people use the caps of big mayonnaise jars instead, which is fine. Weinstein prefers a thickness of 3/4 of an inch to an inch.

7. Dimple the Patty
When beef patties cook, they contract, and can leave you with a rounded, uneven burger. Push a little well into the center of the meat, about an inch or two around and a quarter-inch deep. The burger will be perfectly flat when they're finished cooking.

8. Back in the Fridge
After you've formed your patties, put them back in the fridge to cool down again for 30 to 45 minutes.

9. Use the Right Buns
Too many people put all their efforts into the meat without remembering that the bun forms more than half the burger. Try for a meat-to-bun ratio of 1:1. Buns about 4 inches to 4-1/2 inches round are generally good. You don't want a super-thick burger overhanging the buns -- but rather to get a taste of every element -- meat, bun, toppings -- in every bite.

10. Get the Grill Really Hot
""The hotter the better,"" Weinstein says. ""You're trying to sear or char the meat really quickly so you have nice color on the outside and flavor from the barbecue on it."" Weinstein likes to put wood chips in his grill for added smoke flavor.

11. Be Generous With the Salt and Pepper
Add the spices just before it goes on the grill, and don't be sparing. Weinstein says he doesn't like to add salt before this stage because he doesn't want the salt drying the burger out.

12. Put It on and Leave It Alone
Place the burger on the grill well-side up, then leave it alone. ""The biggest mistake people make is pushing the burger around because they want to look like a grill master,"" Weinstein says. ""Stick it down and leave it. You want to touch the burger three to four times at most. You'll know if you have a sear if it comes right off. If it sticks to the grill, you haven't let it sear long enough.""

13. Get a Nice Criss-Cross Pattern
Here's the secret to that nice pattern people love so much: After you get the first sear, do a quarter turn, leave it alone for a little longer -- a total of 5 to 6 minutes for that first side. Then flip it, cooked-side down, leave it another three to four minutes, then do another quarter turn, let it get its marking, then take it off the grill.

14. Put on the Cheese Before It Leaves the Grill
Add cheese after your last flip or turn, while the burger's still on the grill. It'll start to melt slightly and be nicely oozing by the time it gets to the table.

15. Rest the Meat
After you take it off the heat, let the burger rest and redistribute its juices --for two to three minutes -- just like you would any steak. This way it won't immediately lose its juices at the first bite.

16. Have Plenty of Toppings on Hand
Everyone's got a different idea about what tops the perfect burger. Besides the standards -- lettuce, tomatoes, pickles -- try at least five or six other, less common options. Consider pepperoncini, jalapenos, or dried cranberries and break out of the American-cheddar-Swiss triumvirate of cheeses. Think havarti, Manchego or brie.",,False,self,t5_2qiya,False,,,True,t3_zavsj,http://www.reddit.com/r/meat/comments/zavsj/some_tips_in_order_to_make_the_perfect_burger/,

Then everything went wrong. Meat chunks went into the hopper and got picked up by the screw. They weren't cut. A bit of the muscle went through the die, but ""strings"" of fat would get stuck in the die and clog it. The meat would back up and turn into a gross paste behind the die. 

And it continued. I'd rechill the meat, rechill the plates, and restart. Then more fat would jam and I'd have to disassemble the die and fish it out. It took me about an hour to do the grinding, and the finished product was gross.

I've always thought tritip was a stupidly underrated cut. It's almost always well marbled. It's extremely flavorful. Other than the awkward shape of the full cut which can cause inconsistent cooking it's one of my favorites. Then again, for the longest time it was about $3.50/lb where I live so it was a pretty common part of my meat diet. I'd smoke full triptip roasts and the steaks were my go-to for the perfect size portions and great value.

I know meat in general has gone up in price across the board lately but up here tritip has gone up quite a bit more. It's about doubled in price up to around $6-6.50/lb.

My GF spent some time living in the south and according to her it's an extremely popular cut in some southern states where it fetches a higher price. She was always confused about the rock bottom price of tritip up here.

So what's the deal? Has my area just come into step with the rest of the meat-loving US?

I am a fifth generation meat salesman (or will be when I graduate college next month) at a small company in Pennsylvania. We make smoked meat products like ham, bacon, and a variety of sausages. Two summers ago we launched a website. Shipping has always been a very small part of our business, and we hoped to increase it with the website. It has worked well, but there is always plenty of room to grow. This year while away at school I put up a facebook page. I thought it would be a good idea, but I have really slacked off on keeping it up. 

Here is my plan to change that: I am going to gather as many interesting facts about meat as possible and post one every day. I am going to write them in a planner so that things are planned out well in advance. I was hoping y'all could help me to get started. I am looking for interesting regional dishes or products to share, local festivals or fairs that may involve meat, cooking tips, interesting anecdotes, local legends, etc. Even just telling me something you would be interested in learning about could help me to get my research started.

Here are the basics I'll be working with: NG BBQ with a rear rotisserie burner and good temp control, 24"" rotisserie, I'll start prep at 5am, aiming to serve for 11:30/noon. Serving 20-25 people.

**The cut(s).**
Should I use a separate loin and belly or should I get a whole midsection and peel the skin where it overlaps? I'm getting this custom cut by my butcher so I'm pretty sure I can ask him to do whatever.

**Burners:**
Should I use the rear rotisserie burner or stick with the regular burners? Seems to me that the regular ones will give better heat coverage on the roast.

**Stuffing:**
I thought about throwing a couple of whole pork tenderloins in there in case the loin/belly alone isn't thick enough. I'll also be wrapping the loin in bacon before wrapping the belly around it. Any other stuffings I should consider (other than the seasoning)?

Is a 24"" roast going to be enough for 20-25 people?

A forum I was reading mentioned adding a small amount of Soy Concentrate. Which evidently helps absorb the moisture of melted fat, keeping it in the burger while cooking. In the end, providing you with a tender burger that isn't dry.

Is it very common for people to ask for the butchers behind the counter at a grocery store to cut a ribeye type steak? I have only asked a few times but it feels a bit awkward? Is this a normal thing to do?

The reason is I just happen to like to make a steak extra rare. Sometimes when I get the pre-packed ribeyes they have that old meat smell and taste. I'm those cases I usually throw out the meat which is a huge waste of money for me.

I love cooking meat and I usually cook at home every other day. I want to do a starters-type menu for a party and some 70 people are attending(so alot of food :) ):

My idea was to do a cold smorgasborg of meats and some complimentary sides. I know that we will be drinking some nice apple cider. I was planning on cooking the following things for the table:

1) chicken breasts - marinated in thyme, rosemary, garlic, cider vingar, salt, pepper (maybe paprika?). Cooked in butter and rested, then chilled.

2) pork tender loin - basil, sage, a little bit of chilly,rosemary, garlic, small amount of olive oil. Cooked in butter and rested, then chilled.

3) beef sirloin, aged for 18 days(will have to do that myself), nothing but some salt, pepper and copious amount of butter. Cooked and rested then chilled. Thinking of medium or slightly over?

Sides would be - pickled cabbage and red onion, red onion marmelade, coleslaw with radishes, swedes, paprika. Some chutney which I havent decided on.
Sauces - spicy mayonnaise, ketchup(homemade). Also, I was thinking of making chicken, pork and beef sauce.

How does the idea look so far? Any ways to make good meat into great meat would be very much appreciated :)",,False,self,t5_2qiya,False,,,True,t3_1da9kz,http://www.reddit.com/r/meat/comments/1da9kz/meat_recipe_request_im_cooking_starters_for_a/,

I eat steaks rarely - maybe once a year - a didn't really grow up eating them.  As a result, I don't really know how to approach eating some cuts.

I'm fine on simpler cuts like filet, flank steak, and tri-tip, but more complicated cuts like ribeyes and porterhouses just confuse me.

I made ribeyes last night, and while the meat turned out tasty, I wasn't sure what to eat, what not to eat, how to deal with the fat and gristle, &amp;c.

They are not USDA certified and the facilities are old and retrofitting is the norm. This makes the regulation of atmospheric conditions less consistent. They practice ""dry aging.""  By this i mean several things.  Primarily they hang the sides for about 30 days, and they also keep rib and loin primals on a rack for further drying.  My question is about safety and standard protocol.  I've yet to be able to find an authority on the topic and i hope someone will share their experience and knowledge.  I know spoiling meat is not something to be taken lightly, nor is the health of the customers to whom we cater.  I know there are certain criteria to fulfill to safely age meat( humidity, temp, air flow).  Now to the crux of the matter.. Is it ever acceptable for there to be a fuzzy mold on any of the aging cuts? (pics included) Obviously they do their best to remove any of the ""age"" as they call it.. however i'm wondering how does one differentiate between ""age"" and dangerous growth.  I ask because we recently have taken on a new butcher and they have begun to experience a skin condition, some kind of inflammation or infection, with red bumps around the exposed areas of skin.  Is it possible it is some other aspect of dealing with meat, exposure to bacteria and the like?  An allergy to something else? Other employees who are also exposed, albeit to lesser degrees, don't seem to have any symptoms. Typically when i see primals in a smaller case at the grocer, they have a rind of very dried meat, however never any mold growth.  Lay it on me r/meat, how much of a concern is this? Tangentially related, how do you all feel about the dry aging process in terms of weighing yield losses against tenderness increases?

I, like a lot of people, love a good steak. Personally i love my steak rare. My preferred method of cooking a good steak is on the BBQ and i think i have it down to a fine art, gauging the temps of the coal Vs thickness of the cut of meat, and i can pretty much get my steak spot on each time. 

However it's not quite BBQ weather yet here in the UK and I'm stuck cooking indoors, and i can never seem to get my steak right! How do you cook your steak? do you use a Frying pan on the Hob or do you use a pan in the oven.

* What temps do you use for each method?
* Do you oil the meat(my usual method) or oil the pan?
* Do you need to turn the steak when using the oven?

Most of the time they are very sharp but every now and then a knife or two comes not too sharp and we have to touch it up with our steels.

I asked my ast. manger why we don't just get a good sharpener/stones and sharpen our knives in house and he just said ""this is the way we have done it and how we will do it"" I just think this is the dumbest thing ever. He also said that it would be too much to buy a set of quality knives and sharpener. 

So my question is what knives do you use and do you sharpen them your self? And what would you suggest is the best option for my store.

I took efforts to not overcook them, as that seems to be the biggest mistake people make when making liver(according to the interwebs). 

The onions were delicious, but the liver was.... eh. I have never had any kind of offal before, so the taste and texture were new experiences for me.

A few years ago I made a 5 lb batch of sausages which I really liked and I want to make again. It was a pork sausage made with feta and black olives. I originally found the recipe on the web, but I didn't save it and despite repeated googling I can't find it again.

I suppose I can just wing it for quantities of feta, olives, herbs and spices, but if anyone has this recipe or something similar please post it.

Thanks.

This will be my 4th year in a row making a Thanksgiving dinner for my family. In the past, I've always roasted the turkey whole with good results. I may just do the same this year but after watching [this video](http://www.hulu.com/watch/233296#i0,p6,s1,d0), I've been inspired to try cooking my bird using this method.

In the video, Jacques Pepin removes the backbone of the turkey and lays it atop of a pile of pre-cooked and cooled stuffing. He also removes the legs and stuffs them. 

Since I have only found [this article](http://projects.washingtonpost.com/recipes/2009/11/18/julia-and-jacquess-deconstructed-turkey-cornbread/), my question is about best estimates for cooking time. In the video, Jacques mentions that this reduces the cooking time in half (or at least I think he says this). 

I'm thinking of doing a dry run soon to see for myself with my oven. I've purchased 2 heat-safe digital thermometers - one for measuring the temp of the bird and one for measuring the temp of the oven (I have a feeling my oven varies a bit and tends to be cooler than it's suppose to be). 

I'd love to hear the thoughts/experiences of other cooks/chefs with this type of technique.

I taught myself how to cook upon becoming a vegan about 5 years ago. Now that I'm adopting an omnivorous diet, I need to learn what the heck is what, here. I got a job at an upscale deli hoping for a crash-course on the basics for free (and, well, the idea of somebody handing me a wage for learning was immensely appealing), but that did not pan out quite as intended.

So, now I'm turning to you, Reddit. I know how to cook meat without poisoning myself or my dear boyfriend, but need some help with recipes, anatomy (e.g., different cuts on animals, how they're prepared, what vegetables/grains/alcohol to pair with them, e.t.c.). Just... everything. Dump as much information/resources on me as you can think of. No Jamie Oliver, though, please. Fuck that guy, his douchey hair and his poorly written recipes. :(

Some more stuff to go on: boyfriend's a big seafood fan and I'm really digging the smokey-saltiness of bacon... is there any way to unite the two? Meat is also very costly... I find my grocery bill has jumped from $30 for two weeks worth of meals to $80 (that's just for myself, not including my 6'1"" 180 lb. boyfriend. Dude eats like he's hosting a colony of tapeworms). 

Thanks for any help in advanced, guys. I'll post any recipes I end up making. ",,False,self,t5_2qiya,False,,,True,t3_p4ws5,http://www.reddit.com/r/meat/comments/p4ws5/former_vegan_needs_yer_help/,

""Just eat it"" is a lot easier said than done, believe me. The last time I prepared a steak medium-rare I ended up throwing more than half of it away because I had convinced myself I was going to puke from food poisoning. It mostly stems from my #1 fear of vomiting. The one time I did manage to finish a steak that wasn't well-done, I threw up the next day. However, I also had a bowl of really really really spicy ramen that same day. So I don't know what actually caused it. Needless to say, I vowed never to have steak like that ever again.



So I've come to you guys, in all my shameful glory, hoping that perhaps by chance maybe possibly some of you have been in similar situations and can help me.

It's usually burger balls or chicken thighs. He like a splash of Balsamic vinegar and Worcestershire sauce. I know. I'm insane. He's old, and we love him.

Ordinarily, I buy our food at a local chain of supermarkets called Hannaford. They have great stuff. On the few occasions when I've been near a Shaws, a bigger chain, and have gotten beef or chicken there, Chief won't go near it. I was next to a Shaw's yesterday, and went the lazy route and picked up some hamburger and some chicken, figuring, ""How bad could it be?"" Nope. No luck. He recoils from it like it was pepper-spray. It tastes like shit to me as well, but who ever heard of meat that a dog won't eat?
