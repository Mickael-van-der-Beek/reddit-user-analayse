Beautiful, sweeping camera shots and long takes, including one amazing scene at the end that sees the camera criss-crossing and moving upside down as it follows people through the house, make the movie way better than I think it has any right to be.

***What are the rules?***

Don't worry, we're not going to bog you down with a lot of rules. 

* **Length**: We're not going to worry about length. It can be a true short or even feature length. (We're still calling it a short contest though).
* **Existing Videos**: Are allowed. Yep, if you've made a video in the past you're more than welcome to submit it to the contest. Just be able to prove you did make it.

***Don't have a video yet?***

That's why the contest is running for three months. Get filming!

That's about it. There are no restrictions on content. It is a horror video contest. Be as graphic as you want. Please.

***How do I enter?***

Post a link to your video in this post. 

The process for choosing the winners will be as follows:

* The Dreadit Mods will watch the videos and enter into a discussion on their top picks.

* The mods will choose a ""Top 25"" list. These will be considered the finalists.

* The Top 25 videos will be turned over to our panel of celebrity judges to make the final decision on the winner.

**Our judges will be:**

* **Robert Masciantonio - Director: Neighbor (2009)**

* **C. Robert Cargill - Writer: Sinister (2012)**

(Possibly others)

I actually got the dvd years ago, but was put off by the picture quality. I finally watched the blu ray and really enjoyed it.

It kind of reminded me of Zombie mode in Call of duty Black ops, but with werewolves. There was good acting, good script, and plenty of gore. I really liked how they went with military soldiers so it made sense that they would know how to fight and use/have sub machine guns and weaponry. Also I thought the werewolves looked great and where intimidating and ferocious. I really loved the fact they went with old school practical effects for a 2001 movie. Oh and the director Neil Marshall also directed The decent, and black water which is considered by many the best episode of Game of Thrones. 

I've added a youtube link to the whole movie, but if possible watch it in HD. It's also on Amazon instant video for those with amazon prime accounts.

My mom is a horror buff. I enjoy watching stupid, scary movies, but sometimes I like watching things that are genuinely disturbing and make a commentary on society. But I have a hard time finding people who share my interest. The majority of my friends don't like horror at all, and the others aren't as big into watching movies as I am. I really like analyzing films, as I enjoy analyzing art. I am an Art History/Museum Studies major in college and plan on getting a doctorate in Art History. Film is art. I just wish I knew how to find people who want to have serious discussions about horror films.

1369935858.0,139,self.horror,1fckmh,Want the original Melvin to be in the Toxic Avenger remake?,FilmYak,163,24,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/horror/comments/1fckmh/want_the_original_melvin_to_be_in_the_toxic/,"I'm friends with Mark Torgl, the actor who played Melvin in the original Toxic Avenger. Rumors of a reboot have been ongoing for a few years now, with the latest being that the Governator has signed on for a role. There's also a director listed on IMDB. 

Well, as a fan of the move, I think Mark should have a cameo in the reboot. Mark agrees.  He even suggested he could play Melvin's dad. 

Mark doesn't make his living as an actor -- though he did have a cameo in Toxic IV -- so he doesn't have an agent to make the requisite phone calls.  (He and I both work as editors.)

I've sent an unsolicited email to the director's management firm, which will most likely never be read (but you never know).  

But I think what's really needed is fan support. So if you love the original movie, and if you'd love to see the original Melvin in a cameo role, it's time to beat the blogging drums. I have no specific action to take or suggest, but the blogosphere is a powerful place when driven by us fans. 

I'd love to see if there's more support for this idea, and if anyone has specific ideas on how to spread the word.

Edit: I just asked Mark about doing an AMA. It's his first introduction to reddit (I apologized for the time he was about to lose getting sucked into the vortex) and he's looking over some past AMA's now. He hasn't decided yet, but my guess is he'll be up for it.

Edit2: thanks to countrybuhbuh for coming up with the obvious (except I hadn't thought of it) idea of contacting Lloyd Kaufman. Mark has done so, and at the very least the idea is out there! Thanks everyone! Let's keep our fingers crossed. If this happens, it should be a blast!

Edit 3: good news! Because of all this, Mark will now be joining Lloyd Kaufman at Comicon! He'll only be there on Sunday, July 21. He will be at the Troma booth. This may have a happy ending after all....",,False,,t5_2qh9x,1370038455.0,,,True,t3_1fckmh,http://www.reddit.com/r/horror/comments/1fckmh/want_the_original_melvin_to_be_in_the_toxic/,

Most of it was the usual stuff... underpants, locks of hair, photographs of their dog, friendship pendant halves... creepy and stalkerish, but nothing all that terrifying. What I guess the fans never knew is that the sheer volume of mail meant that a lot of the crap they would send would end up in the garbage, the donation bin, or MINE.

One day, a padded envelope arrived. It was a battered home movie tape with a handwritten label. I'd never heard of the title, but was a bit of a movie buff so thought I would give it a go. This was waaaay before it was easy to download movies, and even before DVDs were common. You could still see where the sticky tape had been put over the anti copy tab.

A few days later, I had the house to myself for the night. The perfect time to watch the battered VHS tape with the handwritten label. I locked the doors. I got a blanket. I made popcorn. Then, because I am very safety conscious, I got my teddy. And pressed play.

What followed was one of the most terrifying and traumatic experiences of my life. The film was fuzzy and filmed on handheld cameras. It looked like a home movie. It didn't seem like it had been edited at all, ran for over 2 hours. And for at least 75% of the time I was scared out of my wits and absurdly grateful I'd had the forethought to get my teddy.

I have never been so utterly terrified by a film before in my life....

...

The tape was 'The Blair Witch Project'.

3 months before release and before any of the hype had started. I had never heard of it and for all intents and purposes, for me, it was real.

BEST way I could have seen the film.

You can bitch about how crap it is all you like, but it was the flagship for 'found footage' films, and noone else had quite done anything like it before. Love it or hate it, it had a gigantic impact. And seeing it under those circumstances was what scared the crap out of me. I never saw it in a cinema. I saw it in a dark empty house, not knowing anything about it except what it told me- that it was 'found footage' that had arrived on a battered VHS tape in the mail.

Thank you to the mysterious stranger who sent that tape, you fucked me up for life :)

I've seen it all, it seems; at least what's defined as 'scary' by this subreddit. 

Don't get me wrong, there's some truly freaky stuff out there, and even more fucked up stuff than I could imagine, but it really feels like I can never get terrified, albeit a cheesy jump-scare (Which, in my opinion, is a pretty cheap scare tactic). I want, almost desperately *need* something that can get into my head, something that'll horrify me from the inside and out. Maybe not a full-on psychological horror movie, but something that could potentially give me nightmares for days on end.

I'm ready to dig to the darkest recesses of the internet to find a truly horrifying film. One that could be the star movie of this subreddit. Is anyone with me on this? Have any insight? Any movie ideas are welcome, I'm guessing I've seen most of the best (Really not trying to brag here, I'm just an insane horror enthusiast), but a discussion on what r/Horror, **all** of r/Horror, thinks is one of the scariest movies of all time, is more than overdue in my opinion.

What do you think?

EDIT: Wow, these comments are great! I feel all special inside that my first self.post isn't completely buried under others, so thanks a lot guys!  I'm glad to see some titles that I've yet to watch, and knowing that they're good enough to be thought of one of the scariest movies out there puts me in a good and ambitious mood:D Keep it up errybody, I'm open to discussion!

Just watched this last night, and I think it was a really good movie.
Technically speaking it had a lot of diversity switching betweens clips, interviews, even cartoon drawings from court sessions. The acting was really, really good. It felt very realistic.

Normally I don't get scared by horror movies. I mean sure you can get shocked, but that's only temporarily. It's been a long time since I watched a movie that made feel paranoid to the point, where afterwards when I'd gone to bed, I'd get startled when somebody walked past my door(even though I live in a big apartment building).

I'd wish more movies were as good at displaying psychotic, sadistic behavior. The sheer cruelty of the movie, and how thorough it is at displaying a sick man's mind, showing perspectives from the team that investigated him to his very own footage of his actions.

A lot of the footage tapes reminds me of what you can find in the fucked up parts of the internet. It is so well done. Some of the scenes displayed so much pain. When he first captured that girl, the way she's tied up with hands, feet AND head together  on her back, or when he is playing around on the floor in his own little dramatic way before slowly sticking two needles into the woman's neck, while you can see blood coming out of her mouth, but not really going anywhere because of the wrapper around her mouth.

The scenes where he catches his victims are very well made too. The killer is so good at changing his personality, and it makes me feel very uncomfortable, because of the way it fades out the line between  him being a normal nice guy giving you a lift to the nearest gas station  to the point where he asks ""Why'd you call me officer?"", revealing his true identity. 

Also, the way he lets his victim realize that she's going to go through so much torture before finally getting killed, without them having any control about it, before he deals the coupe de grace in terms of ""I don't think either of us want you to live with the things I'm gonna do to you."".

And the damage he can do is just way beyond that of physical power. You don't think it's possible that can actually make somebody love him as their ""master"", when you watch the initial scenes of him with Dempsey, where he starts her ""training"". Then you realize in the scenes after he's released Cheryal after 8 years of brutally torturing her that this is not an action of mercy, but instead his greatest torture of her yet, because he's damaged her mind so horribly. The scene where she sits obviously in need of somebody to tell her what to do, keeping on saying ""I don't know what you want me to say."", before scratching her head, and showing that he actually chopped her hand off, while expressing her love for him. It just felt so real and evil.

His psychotic mind is such a scary force that you can't control, because all it desires is to be in control.

So, anyways, just wanted to give this movie some credit, because I thought it was way up there with the big ones in terms of staying true to what the genre's all about: Horror.",,False,,t5_2qh9x,False,,,True,t3_13xl8b,http://www.reddit.com/r/horror/comments/13xl8b/a_praise_of_the_poughkeepsie_tapes/,

I was just thinking about how much I love having a place where I can indulge my horror freak-ness with people who will understand. None of my friends are into horror, and it is kind of frustrating and, perhaps oddly, kind of lonely. My best friend can't really watch anything scary/violent, my boyfriend doesn't either, and my (fairly small) group of assorted acquaintances never have any idea what on earth I'm talking about. They're all into their own variety of nerdiness, and seem to have plenty of people who share the same things. I usually just end up sitting there awkwardly while everyone talks about computer programming or Firefly or Pokemon or the like. I'm not really a social person anyway, but it makes it worse when I do try to push myself into social situations and I end up kind of on the outside because no one else reads the same books or likes Horror or punk music or anything.

How wrong was I.

During the previews there was non-stop laughter and talking. Maybe they will shut up when the movie starts, I thought. Wrong again. These fucking bitches must have confused the movie theatre for a coffee shop. One of the ladies actually took her phone out in the middle of the movie to GOOGLE SOMETHING AND MAKE A PHONE CALL. Are you serious right now? 

So, me being me, I waited outside the theatre after the movie to give them a piece of my mind. As they walked out I said ""just to let you know, you just ruined a movie I have been waiting a year to see."" They looked at me like I was crazy and scoffed. They started walking to the bathroom, and as I had just drank a ton of Diet Coke that was my destination as well. ""Why are you following us?"" They asked. Bitch, I have to pee too. So, I let them have it.

I tore into them while walking to the bathroom, while in the bathroom, and while walking out. They seemed to think that they weren't disturbing anyone and that a movie theatre is a ""public place."" They also thought that I ""Shouldn't have waited a year to see such a dumb movie and I should get a life."" Yeah bitch, it is a public place, but that doesn't give you the right to act like it's your fucking living room. How would you feel if I bugged the shit out of you while you were trying to enjoy something you were passionate about? So, legs shaking, I parted them with a glorious ""you are such fucking assholes"" and a majestic middle finger. 

I dearly hope they get home and re-think going to see a movie when clearly all they want to do is chat.

What in the actual fuck is wrong with people.

**So, I'm curious - what do you guys do in situations like this?  Also, do you think horror movies tend to invite this sort of behavior more than others?  I wonder if there is something about the atmosphere that makes people think it's okay to not take the movie seriously.**",Soapbox,False,,t5_2qh9x,False,soapbox,,True,t3_1c0m0i,http://www.reddit.com/r/horror/comments/1c0m0i/went_to_see_evil_dead_today_a_rant_and_a_question/,

I was actually surprised at how well this movie blended suspense, horror, and dark comedy(lightly).

I just wanted to thank you guys. Every day last month I posted a different blog entry reviewing horror movies and you guys never gave me shit about the shameless advertising. My blog became popular enough that when I decided to do a panel yesterday at Comikaze (my first time EVER doing a panel) it was a huge success.

I got to talk horror movies with Sybil Danning (Howling 2), Felissa Rose (Sleepaway Camp), Leslie Andrews (Sick Girl), Robert Angelo Masciantonio (Neighbor), John Stewart Muller (Last Halloween), Devanny Pinn (Piranha 3D) and Rebekah McKendry (Fangoria Magazine  Editor). Sadly there was no sound guy to record this panel so I don't have any audio to show you. But I will post a picture in a second.

The panel was so well received that Fangoria wants me to write some articles for them and I've been invited on 3 more panels at the convention (if you're going to Comikaze in LA today I'll be in room 4 at 4pm talking Zombies). I'm trying to line up future panels at different conventions including Monster Mania in Cherry Hill and Blood on the Beach in Virginia.

I figure with a large community like Reddit, it'd be really easy to generate interest and as far as I know there hasn't really been an internet based collaboration like this before. 

I'd love to talk ideas and hear what you think about the potential project, good or bad. So come on Dreadit, let's hear it!

But for those who don't ...we (the /r/horror denizens collectively known as Dreadit) are voting for our favorite/bestest ever movies by category for the Dreadit wiki. This will be the Dreadit Movie Guide, a handy compendium for users new and old.

Let's keep it simple:

1. FORMAT: **Movie name** - *director name* - year, ex: **The Beyond** - *Lucio Fulci* - 1981. (An IMDB or Wiki link is fine to include.)
2. REPOSTING: Don't do it! Don't do it! For the love of all that is holy, DO NOT DO IT. Please. Ctrl-F, dudes! If someone's already listed your favorite, cry a little inside and then give it a vote. From now on, any dupes will be removed!
3. VOTING: Up for movies you think are worthy. Please do not downvote something just because you haven't seen or heard of it. HOWEVER, if something legitimately does not belong on the list because it's somehow an invalid entry, then downvote away.

You have about a fortnight to submit and vote. If you submit and vote early (and I do suggest that you submit early), I strongly suggest checking back before the tally for any movies you may have missed the chance to vote on.
