I swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States from all enemies, foreign and domestic. I see police who violate that document as a domestic enemy.

In the military we conduct what are called safety stand down days. Essentially all work stops and we conduct safety related classes. On one of these several months ago, we had a state cop talk to us. He mentioned that in Texas, you can get arrested for swearing in public.

This didn't sit well with me, so I prepared in the event he spoke to us again. He did, and my studying paid off. He made the same statement again. It came time for the Q&amp;A portion; my hand shot up faster than French hands during time of conflict.

Mind you, the setting is in an auditorium with my entire Battalion. 1,000 Soldiers, Non-Commissioned Officers (NCOs) and Commissioned Officers.
Me:""Sir, I have a question. You mentioned that we can get arrested for using vulgar language in public (to include vulgar language on a shirt). What state law specifically states this? I ask because this would be a blatant violation of our 1st and 14th amendment rights. There have also been numerous supreme court cases at the state and federal level that have heard cases on civilians being arrested or ticketed for using ""vulgar language"" in public, and they have won those cases. Specifically I cite Cohen V California. In this case, which set a precedence for the nation in free speech and vulgar language, one of the justices said ""the state may not, consistently with the first and fourteenth amendments, make the simple public display of this single four letter (the ""F"" one if you were wondering) expletive a criminal case."" He also said ""...states cannot censor their citizens in order to make a ""civil"" society."" Also, the Constitution is at the federal level and trumps state laws, including this one. How does texas think it can violate this, and again, what law does Texas have that says this?"" 

At this point all I heard was a waft of ""OOOOhhhhh....daaamn."" And other laments of disbelief and ownage. 

The cop's only response was ""you can try it (to swear in public)...but don't mess with Texas.""

I was flabbergasted. My jaw dropped open. All of that for a "" don't mess with Texas"" response. The look on his face was fantastic and well worth it. The sheer surprise and shock of someone standing up to him. 

As he left I bushwhacked him some more, away from everyone in the lobby. His tone rapidly changed to ""I was explaining a worse case scenario"". I proceeded to shoot down each of his examples. One of them was several people in the local mall had obscenities on their shirts. They were asked to leave and didn't and were then arrested. He made it sound like they were arrested for their shirts, but they were arrested for trespassing.

This wen't on and on and on. Everything he said I was able to shoot down with a quickness. I finally got sick of arguing with this sorry, inbred, excuse for a human being and told him this: ""Our Constitution was established to protect our rights from tyranny.  I believe it was Thomas Jefferson who said, ""When injustice becomes law, resistance becomes duty."" You remember that."" And I walked off.

I publicly embarrassed a state pig who had been with the force for 20 years in front of my entire, 1,000 strong, battalion. I found out later my Battalion Commander (A Lieutenant Colonel) and my Brigade Commander (a Colonel) were in the audience at the back. I had everyone from Privates to Captains come up to me during the rest of the day and give me a pat on the back, agreeing with me 100%.

That, right there, ladies and gentlemen is justification for higher education.

But if you are a young male living near the down-town area of a city like me, you probably worry much, much more that you will be bullied by the police for some bullshit thing. Besides, most common criminals don't want to hurt you - they want your money or to sell you drugs. Going to prison is much more likely to disrupt your life and create a bad record that will follow you everywhere you go than getting mugged is. When it comes right down to it I'd rather be harassed for one night and have a hundred bucks of cash and my iPod and phone stolen from me than be harassed through protracted legal proceedings and spend a week in jail.

Remember that [at any given time, 743 of every 100,000 people are imprisoned](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incarceration_in_the_United_States) in the United States. What portion of people are being mugged or attacked at any given time? _Maybe_ 10 of every 100,000? Probably not even that high. I don't know, but it can't be anywhere near the rate of incarceration.

After winning $60k from the SPD for lying about videos he requested, he got $10k for his false arrest.

[Eric recently won $10k from the SPD](http://blogs.seattleweekly.com/dailyweekly/2012/01/eric_rachner_who_won_60000_in.php) in a case that started years ago in October 2008 when officer Michele Letizia arrested Eric and the City prosecuted him for challenging an order to turn over his ID.

Eric has a strong interest in civil rights and is well versed in law.  Officer Michele Letizia and the SPD not so much. I've posted a relatively brief summary of how this all began in the comments below and here's a [good article from 2010](http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/Local-computer-security-expert-investigates-887914.php#page-1) if you enjoy a long read. Seriously, if you liked *The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo* trilogy, you'll probably love this.

Seattle PD has created a catch-22 system under their interpretation of a Washington *privacy law* they claim forbids the release of dashcam video until the statute of limitations has expired for cases of police misconduct. They continue to withhold video, recently going so far as to [sue an attorney for appealing SPD's decision](http://www.komonews.com/news/local/Seattle-sues-attorney-over-public-records-request-136704018.html) not to release dashcam videos in a misconduct case. It should be noted that the [SPD has no problem releasing video quickly if they feel it supports their position](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyFB8U1oVwg&amp;feature=youtube_gdata).

Eric has taken the transaction logs of videos on the police system he received in his case against the SPD dating from July 2008 through August 2011 and [created a web site searchable by anyone](http://seattlepolicevideo.com/) to find out if they have been denied videos. Even without the actual video, an attorney can get a case dismissed or a conviction overturned if there is proof that the police haven't turned over evidence. 

As Eric's attorney Cleveland Stockmeyer put it, ""How many people are sitting in jail who asked for their tapes and were told no, they can't have them, I don't know. But I tell you we're going to freaking find out."" 

Keep in mind that the [US DOJ started their investigation of the SPD](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2017026414_doj16m.html) after Eric's arrest. I don't know how much he worked with the DOJ, but if they had to rely on the SPD to release video of misconduct cases they were investigating, it's obvious that Eric's transaction logs would be of great value.

Eric works with news reporters to uncover video that might support cases they are investigating and is assisting one news station in their [lawsuit against the SPD for breaking state public records law](http://www.komonews.com/news/local/130138973.html) and denying public access to the videos.

Here's the strange thing though, the dashcam videos are under complete control of the the SPD who aren't releasing anything, yet there has been a surge in dashcam videos showing up in news reports. After dashcam video of [officer Shandy Cobane stomping on a prone man](http://blogs.seattleweekly.com/dailyweekly/2010/12/shandy_cobane_seattle_pd_mexic.php) and threatening to beat the ""Mexican piss"" out of the innocent man was leaked, SPD [Chief John Diaz hired an outside attorney to oversee an investigation](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2017052223_spdinvestigator20m.html) into confidential information leaked to the news media. The SPD eventually turned over one video of this incident to the DOJ though Eric determined there were several more they didn't.

Dashcam videos that have recently surfaced:

*  [Teen tazed and arrested for ""lipping off"" when he told police they had no legal authority to demand his ID](http://www.komonews.com/news/local/Attorneys-SPD-dash-cam-video-shows-unnecessary-use-of-force-137328443.html?tab=video&amp;c=y). This type of case will easily hit a large settlement amount.

* [Officers mock Seattle jogger nearly killed by a truck](http://grist.org/list/2011-12-21-cops-mock-seattle-jogger-nearly-killed-by-a-truck/).

* [Officer Ian Birk shoots and kills homeless woodcarver just seconds after getting out of his car](http://www.komonews.com/news/local/120993149.html?tab=video&amp;c=y).

* [Two undercover officers yank an innocent man from his car and beat him](http://www.kirotv.com/news/news/seattle-officers-just-yank-em-comment-raises-quest/nFjdq/).

* [Officer Kevin Oshikawa-Clay slams a compliant man's head into the hood of his patrol car](http://www.komonews.com/news/local/120521724.html).

* [Officer Garth Haynes kicks the face of cuffed man laying on the ground](http://www.komonews.com/news/local/115682874.html?tab=video&amp;c=y).

Three of the videos claim to have been obtained exclusively by the news station while the others do not disclose how the video was made available. I have read that Eric helped determine what video was available in two cases and suspect his hand in more. My guess is reporters ask him to identify which videos they need and then use their own sources inside the SPD to get a copy.

It's a sad state of affairs when people have to rely on Eric and news reporters to get evidence they have a right to. These cases will continue to rack up big settlements until Seattle, [or the DOJ](http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2011/December/11-crt-1660.html), puts a stop to the rampant police brutality. Until then I am glad that there is someone like Eric fighting the good fight.

This was as a result of a 'journalist' seeking out his personal information and threatening to publish it, which would have a significant impact on his life. 

Adrian Chen has engaged in an active pursuit to harrass and, allegedly, blackmail reddit moderators with public release of photos and personal information, and has also been implicated in posting large-scale hoaxes and attacks against reddit as a whole.

As moderators, we feel that this type of behavior is completely intolerable. We volunteer our time on Reddit to make it a better place for the users, and should not be harassed and threatened outside of reddit for that. We should all be afraid of the threat of having our personal information investigated and spread around the internet if someone disagrees with you. Reddit prides itself on having a subreddit for everything, and no matter how much anyone may disapprove of what another user subscribes to, that is never a reason to threaten them.

As a result, the moderators of /r/bad_cop_no_donut have chosen to disallow links from the Gawker/Jezebel network until action is taken to correct this serious lack of ethics and integrity. We thank you for your understanding.

The following websites are no longer going to get traffic from /r/bad_cop_no_donut :

If you absolutely must post something from one of these websites, post a screenshot. Please do not link there or your post will be removed, even self posts. 

/r/politics ; /r/gaming ; /r/games ; /r/mensrights are all doing this as well. Expect more reddits to join suit in the coming days.

A Harrisonburg, VA resident witnessed an HPD officer beat an injured domestic cat to death reportedly over 15 or 16 times with their night club.

The stunned witness reported the commotion was extremely violent and excessive, this occuring in the middle of a residential area. The officer ""removed the body, but the resident had to clean up the rest."" The news channel revealed that our local police department received complaints and that the matter is being handled ""internally"".

Reddit, this is abhorrent. In the name of justice for animals, please inundate this police department with complaints and don't let them sweep it under the rug without due investigation.

Police Overkill

By ROBERT KAHN 

Wednesday, June 06, 2012

Courthouse News Service 


BALTIMORE (CN) - When an architect crashed his car while suffering a diabetic reaction on the way home from Bible study class, state and county police pepper sprayed him in the face and clubbed and Tasered him to death, his wife claims in court.

Linda Johnson sued the Maryland State Police, Baltimore County Police, their top commanders and six officers who allegedly beat and Tasered to death Carl D. Johnson on May 27, 2010.

Johnson suffered a diabetic attack sometime after 8:15 p.m. that night, after calling a friend to tell him he was leaving his Bible class, according to the complaint in Baltimore County Court.

He suffered a diabetic attack, crashed on the I-795, and his car came to rest against the guardrail in the median near the merger with I-695.

According to the complaint, when State Trooper Davon Parker arrived and tapped on the window, and Johnson managed to lower the window, Parker pepper sprayed him in the face.

Johnson then got out of his car and Parker clubbed him at least once in the knee. Defendant Officer Loss (fnu) then arrived and whacked Johnson at least twice with his club, the complaint states.

Baltimore County Police Officer Nicholas Wolferman then arrived, whacked Johnson ""at least three times"" with his own baton, then he and Officer Loss ""grabbed Mr. Johnson and threw him over the guardrail,"" Johnson's widow says.

She claims the very first officer on the scene knew or should have known that her husband was suffering from a medical problem.

Nonetheless, after throwing him over the guardrail, the cops applied pressure points to his ears and armpits, she says. Three more cops arrived, including Baltimore County Officer Andrew O'Neill, who Tasered Johnson twice. Officer Loss then punched him in the face and the six officers managed to handcuff him, the widow says.

Eight more cops arrived, and someone took his wallet, which included a medical alert card about his diabetes. Nonetheless, the cops forcibly held him down, though he was not resisting, and was handcuffed, his wife says.

""Upon information and belief, there were approximately 52 individuals that responded to the scene,"" according to the complaint.

The widow claims Johnson was Tasered at least three times, while he was lying on his back, helpless, surrounded by police. He became ""motionless and speechless"" and was pronounced dead within an hour of cardiac arrest.

He was the 10th person to die since 2004 after being subjected to police electroshock in Maryland, the Baltimore Sun reported in a story about Johnson's death.

Linda Johnson seeks more than $10 million in punitive damages for wrongful death, loss of consortium, false imprisonment, false arrest, battery, gross negligence and other charges. She is represented by Mark Millstein and David Silbiger, both of Baltimore.

*****

Yesterday (5.26.2012), at ~1:53PM, Redmond, WA PD officer W. B. Corson (Badge number 0575, Cruiser number 1529) pulled me over while riding my bicycle. I immediately got out my phone and attempted to record the traffic stop using [Qik](http://www.qik.com). The officer asked what I was doing, and when I explained that I was recording him, he threatened me with illegal arrest under the state recording law. I presume he was referring to [RCW 9.73.030](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.73.030), but that does not apply because RCW 9.73.030 only restricts recording *private* communication where the parties have not given consent. There is no expectation of privacy in public. Furthermore, Courts of Appeals in multiple circuits and the Department of Justice have said that recording the police in public is a first amendment right.

[**Here is a link to the video.**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71abF8uzW7Q) After I stopped recording, the officer was argumentative, disrespectful, and gave me a warning for breaking two laws that did not apply (more below). In fact, the officer originally wasn't going to tell me what laws I had allegedly violated and I had to press him for him to even write it on my warning citation. My drivers license was also demanded (again after I protested), even though I was not operating a motor vehicle.

~~My question is: **How do I find a lawyer?** Would I be better off contacting the ACLU? I plan to file an official complaint with Redmond PD, but I have little hope of that accomplishing anything. Would a lawyer be willing to take this case on contingency? I'm not even sure where to begin.~~

**edit** I have been in contact with Redmond PD and am hopeful that the internal affairs process can resolve this case to my satisfaction.

(If you're not interested in why I was pulled over, you can stop reading here.)

Circumstances of the traffic stop: I was riding my bicycle with 2 friends on Cleveland Street, a one-way 2-lane road, when the officer above pulled us over. I had been riding on the left side of the right lane, and my other two friends on the right side of the same lane, one in front of the other (all of this is legal). The officer warned me for ""impeding traffic,"" under [RCW 41.61.425](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=46.61.425) (which doesn't apply because Cleveland Street isn't a single lane per direction, there is another lane to pass), and [RCW 41.61.427](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=46.61.427) (which doesn't apply because a bicycle is not a motor vehicle). I was also cited for not riding on the right side of the lane, but [that RCW](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=46.61.770) has a safety exception. Riding to the far right side of the lane is not safe because cars can and will attempt to pass in the same lane. That RCW also explicitly allows people to ride two-abreast in the lane, which is what we were doing.

Both sides of the fight confirmed I was trying to keep the peace.  An officer for some reasons unknown to me got up in my face and repeatedly said things along the lines of come on and do something, hit me so I can beat the shit out of you. I asked why he would talk to me like that, and I wouldn't talk to him like that.  He's says to me, of course you wouldn't because you are a cunt.  I asked for his name and badge number repeatedly and he refused saying, Don't worry about who the fuck I am, let me worry about who you are.  He seriously seemed like he was having roid rage or something.

Update: I emailed the Police Chief (who is an ex-girlfriends uncle) about it explaining I wanted to talk to him, but they wouldn't let me make a meeting with him.  He promptly responded that than since we are friends and he knows I wouldn't lie about something like this that they have basically upped the seriousness of the complaint and are reviewing all the cruiser videos to try and see what happened.  Unfortunately basically none of this happened in front of a cruiser so I don't know what they'll hear or see.
