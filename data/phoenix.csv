1334547230.0,388,self.phoenix,sbu2c,"Hey Phoenix, I'm stranded...",thegeekmeister,454,66,234,http://www.reddit.com/r/phoenix/comments/sbu2c/hey_phoenix_im_stranded/,"I'm from Dallas, TX and last Thursday I went on a road trip to the San Diego Zoo, and I was also planning on going to Joshua Tree National Park.

Well on Saturday I logged into my bank account to find my car note came out 10 days early.

I had to cut my vacation short, and start heading home in hopes I could find rideshares.

I did find someone who paid for my gas to get here, but I'm not finding anything else.

So long story short, can anyone help me out?  It will cost me $160 to get me and my car home.  I would do almost anything to get home at this point.

Edit: I have an interview on Tuesday for a job I desperately need.

Edit 2: I'm a dude.

Edit 3: Wow, first page of r/Phoenix.  First line in fact.  Thanks for the help guys :)

Edit 4: Mcbullseye saved the day!  I'm on my way home :)  I cannot thank all of you enough.  You sir deserve [this](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41N0YCWX0FL._SL500_AA300_.jpg).

Edit 5: WarLizard is awesome too.  Thank you for attempting to help.  I owe you some reddit gold too.

Status: I made it out of Arizona.  I'm currently at a loves off of 10 filling up.  I pulled over to sleep some last night.

Status 10:31am Mountain Time: Stopped at a McDonalds in Las Cruces, NM for the free wifi, stretch break, etc.  Dug into my change jar to buy a mcdouble and a mcchicken.  I'm 11 hours away from home now.

Status: 11:17pm CST 4/16/12: I made it home.  I have never been more happy to be home than now.

I thank all of you for getting this noticed.  

McBullseye: I gave you my card.  You told me to pay it forward, and I will, but I still want to pay you back so if you ever need help, or need/want that money back call me.  I am VERY grateful.

WarLizard: You deserve my gratitude also.  I left for home before you made it, I also sent you to the wrong Starbucks, but the fact that you would help out a complete stranger really means something.



There is nothing worse than feeling like you were just scammed, so I'm going to offer as much proof as possible.

I made it to Dallas.  The pic here is geotagged.  Also, Carrollton Park Apartments is located in Dallas at 18211 Kelly Blvd. [https://www.dropbox.com/sh/uz5wk7p3xrdjin2/ry3wZkCcil/C360_2012-04-17-06-57-55.jpg](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/uz5wk7p3xrdjin2/ry3wZkCcil/C360_2012-04-17-06-57-55.jpg)

The car payment came out because I had it on autopay, the funds weren't there to cover it last month on the 25th until I week ago a pretty good gig came my way.  So I called them and asked them to run it then.  They did.  But I'm guessing they didn't stop the auto payment from trying to come out.

Things can turn around for me quickly because for the past 5 years I've been self employed working under the name Dallas Computer Techs.  Business has been very good up until about 6 months ago.  After I went through all of my ""buffer"" money 3 months later business picked up just enough to scrape by, and I've been looking for a job since.

Before I came to reddit, I was trying to find rideshares, computer repair work, or anything using Craig's List.  I ended up in Phoenix because I found someone needing to go from San Diego, to Palm Springs, to Phoenix.  They paid for all the gas to get this far.

Have you ever had such a bad week that you just want to get away from it all?  And if you do it always makes you feel better.  That bad week has been last month for me.

I have 3 close friends that would've done something for me if they could.  1 of them is incarcerated, 1 of them has been unemployed and his gf is supporting him, and the one with the kid wasn't answering his phone.  I have a sister and a mother.  I didn't think about calling my sister, in hindsight I should've, but it is hard to get a hold of her sometimes.  And my mom is a trophy wife to a guy who does not approve of my lifestyle because he is uber christian.  (I'm bi, have dated dudes and girls before, and he knows this.  Also getting a divorce is an abomination also.  And to make things even better, I'm atheist.)

I bank at First Convenience. (I'm changing them ASAP, crap bank, ugghhh.)  To call you need what they call a TIN, it's a 4 digit number, I don't know it because I've never tried calling them before, and I have to goto my bank to reset it.  To my knowledge there is not a First Convenience in Arizona.

I am very ashamed I had to ask for help.  In no way was I trying to ask for a handout.  I was prepared to earn it, or at the very least give it back asap.

I'm extremely dumb for going on that trip.  A ton of things could've happened.  My tire could've gone flat.  My car could've broke down.  I could've fallen asleep at the wheel.  I am willing to except the fact that I made poor plans and poor decisions, and high risks.

TL;DR: I was stranded far away from home, McBullseye helped despite the fact it could've been a scam,  WarLizard was going to do the same but I was already on my way home.  I offered as much proof as possible.",,False,self,t5_2qmpu,True,,,True,t3_sbu2c,http://www.reddit.com/r/phoenix/comments/sbu2c/hey_phoenix_im_stranded/,

Saturday morning a kid I took under my wing through coaching him in baseball because of his shitty home life. 
His hous caught fire and is completely gone on Saturday morning (News link below). This kid has seen tragedy after tragedy man. He is a smart kid and deserves so much better. I just got off the phone with his mom, who insisted I just keep him.
He lost all of his clothes, his 360, his tv, all of his baseball gear, his game collection and his collection of cards just to mention a few.  He is a kid man.
So here I am reaching out to anyone and everyone. Notice I am not using a throwaway for validity reasons. I would like this to get visibility. Any ideas or cross posts. I want to help him out as much as I can. I can ensure you, he will make a video thanking everyone and everything will be going to him. Please help me help this poor kid.
  I have all of his sizes and such if needed. PLEASE REDDIT COME THROUGH FOR THIS KID!!!    
  http://www.myfoxphoenix.com/story/22098653/2013/04/27/family-escapes-burning-scottsdale-home-flames-spread-to    


  UPDATE: I am at work. When I get a few moments I will respond to everyone. You guys seriously rock. Thanks you so much. THE BOY is a great kid and does not deserve this bowl of crap life handed him.    

  UPDATE: I just walked in the door, my phone died on the bus. We have running and everything tonight. (The Boy) and I will sit down and answer all of these at roughly 8:30PM AZ time. I can not say thank you enough.
For those that think there is something in this for me, you are dead wrong. I do not even want a pat on my back, you know why? Because we are human beings, and when one of us needs help we should do our best to try and help, even if it is encouragement or words. That is what we are supposed to do. THANKYOU GUYS!! Talk to you soon.    
  
  UPDATE: I just got into work and I will be able to go through Reddit. Last night we were very busy. 2 kids had games, Pepe (as I call him) hung out and watched. We did not get home until 9:00PM at which point it was homework time. Tonight we have nothing going on aside from painting his room. I will go through what I can here and answer everything. After work 4PM AZ time, I will have him setup and account and he can answer some stuff too.
Again, I would like to say a big heart felt thank you. The response so far has been overwhelming. We will go through and answer each and everyone of these. To answer everyone about if I have kids or not, yes I do, I have 4 kids 6yo girls, 8 yo boy, 13 yo girl and 14 yo girls (she goes to school with BOY, they have been friends and he has been hanging with us since we moved her 3 years ago.  
  UPDATE: My wife is going over and taking pics now. He is in school and than he has track until 4, I am doing my bets at replying to all now.    
  UPDATE: A lot of people are sending me nasty grams. Sorry man, I am working. I promise we will go through these this evening. For further proof (I don't know how much this helps) I posted a response in ABC 15 using real name. Feel free to friend me on FB as well, u will see it is posted there too. I also posted using real information to Reddit Phoenix. How idiotic and callus would I have to be man? I would also think that this would be criminal if faked / duped. It is fraud, plain and simple.  
  http://www.abc15.com/dpp/news/region_northeast_valley/scottsdale/scottsdale-garage-fire-phoenix-tempe-and-scottsdale-fire-crews-respond-to-1st-alarm-fire  
  
  
  * UPDATE: Sorry it has been a day. We were  extremely busy yesterday. I am reaching out to community resources as well, that stuff does not happen overnight. In the mean time I just wanted to help this kid, and to be honest, I did not know what to do, so I did the one thing I know, Reddit. There is a reason I used all my real information and not some throwaway. If you look through this thread and look at a link or 2 I posted, it will not be too hard to figure out my real information. Google the hell out of me, I have not been shy about leaving a foot print. But just understand I am trying to do something good here.  By the way he is 13 (he just says hes 14 because his bday is in July.
To answer some emails and such I have gotten this. ""Why are you doing this, what do you get out of it""? I hit on this before. You know when you see a car broken down at an intersection, and everyone is just laying on their horn, you know that one guy, the small one, who jumps out and help the person push it to safety and check on them, that's me. That guy who notices u dropped you wallet or card and I immediately get you attention, that's me. I see someone down I help them out. If I se someone getting bullied or taken advantage of, I step up, all while everyone around just sits and rubber necks. I am the guy who still tell you to have a great day, I hold the door and say please and thank you. I have respect for authority and my elders.  
Another reason. I had an alcoholic lush of a mom who walked out on me when I was 6, she left my ""Dad"" to raise and take care of 3 growing boys and 2 step kids that weren't his. He stepped up. With that sai, it got to him. He drank himself to death. By the time I was 15 he had knocked out half my teeth. I moved out on my own at 16 years old, I moved to the UP to try and finish high school. As I remember parents weren't so understanding and were not fast to accept me. I was staying in garages, sneaking in windows, all so I could go to high school every day.  I have had nothing in my life handed to me. I lied when I was 16 so I could work nights at the foundry, yes at 16. It was then I realized I had this skill nobody else really had, I could rock a computer, it just all mad sense. So that's how I made myself. My wife and I do NOTHING on credit (Probably really cause we couldn't get it if we wanted as that all went to hell in my twenties when I was trying to survive). MY Mom did eventually come back and we made a menz when I was 17, she tried to help with everything she could. My dad, I would go years with out seeing him. I did not even visit him on his death bed, a regret I hold still. So you asked why are you doing this? I really do not know, maybe it is my past, maybe it is my need to help all the time, maybe this kid just has something special and deserves so much more. Google me to hell Mike Slomanski.  

 With all that said here is what we received so far from Reddit: 

* Dominos Gift Card from AstroZombie138 (Thank you so much, having dinner delivered and paid for last night helped more than you know)


I know we have gotten offers, but we have 1 car, I take the bus to work, Like most of you we live pay check to paycheck, which we are between atm. So picking stuff up is very hard, I will try to arrange a day this week. I am open to suggestions. I am open to people stopping by to meet him personally. We are a close family, I have 4 kids of my own. We have normal family problems, for those who google mapped me, I RENT, which I am 1 month behind on, as a matter of fact I think I am behind on every bill. Again we do not do credit, and I am by far your typical Scottsdale DBag. I live on the other side of Shea, by the res. The schools are great there.

What we got from Neighbors and me:

* I got him a futon and air mattress to sleep on
* An old CRT 24"" TV I picked up at a rummage
* 1 pack of boxer briefs 
* 1 Pack of socks
* A Pair of shoes 1 size too big
* A neighbor gave him $50.00, he snuck it to his mom
* A bicycle I fixed that was laying around.


Now as you can all see, we aren't coming out like ""Bandits"". If THE BOY gets an overabundance of items, I am open to suggestion. I personally would say donate it a Teen shelter in Reddits name, but that is yet to be seen or known.  
  Of course I know how generous Reddit could be, if I did not think this kid deserved it, I would not have come to you guys.
  Also, he did manage to get his baseball gear, it was in my trunk the entire time.
  Another question I get asked, does he have his own room? Yes, and he needs his own space. I have given him structure and set expectations, he seems to like that.

What could he use:
* Teenage boy stuff, he love video games, he likes to read, he like to go out and be active
* Toiletries (You know like Axe, deodorant, soap, shampoo)
* He could use a pair of shoes that fit (10)
* Sizes are 32x32, Large shirts, 10 Shoe and Large BBall shorts.
* Clothes are always good
* Games, outdoor stuff, idk really.
* He loves baseball
* I really want him to play RISK, I think he would love it.
* I know he doesn't need it, but I would like to see him get something fun to pass time and take his mind off. I am not asking for brand new things. If you have a console and some games that just collect dust or something , that would be great for the kid.
*Any thing else you guys can think of
*Like I said I live paycheck to paycheck and now have a family of 7, so yes, things like food, gas card, electric cards are a big help at the moment (I always give back)
In lieu of cash I would ask you send him gift cards or something, although I guess cash couldn't hurt, I just don't want to see him sneaking it to his Mom.
* Anything else you can think of for a 14 yo boy (He finally told me yesterday (I am 13, I turn 14 in July, I just say I am 14)
* I have an old ass XBOX but it has the Red Ring, I have some older games too, if anyone knows how to fix it, that would be awesome too and he could just have it.

I do not want to put a picture, after speaking with a Crisis Officer at the PD he and I both agreed I need to keep as much personal information of his off of here. If you want to meet him while u drop something off, he will gladly meet you and say thank you.

Again My Name is Mike Slomanski, google it, did the dirt, I do not care, nor do I have anything to hide. I am trying to do what is right and what I would hope anyone else would do. 

If you want my addy or phone number just message me or hit me on FB. Thanks again everyone, sorry for the novel and lack of response yesterday.

He had fallen from about 200 feet. Thanks for all the kind words and all those who helped.

Facts:

* Last communication with him has been at 5:30 pm Monday.
* He was out of water at this time and had said he had left his shirt behind at some point.
* Search and Rescue are looking for him. I know there has been a helicopter with a heat sensor and a dog also used in the search and rescue.
* The police have said that his phone has been turned off or ran out of battery around 1:30AM Tuesday.
* He is a 34 years old.
* His name is Chris, [here is a picture of him](http://i.imgur.com/Zr6pe0Y.jpg) and [him &amp; his daughter](http://i.imgur.com/V05m6SL.jpg).
* **Updated map:** He had **left from the ""A"", here**: [Map](http://i.imgur.com/qvrP5o2.jpg).
* He is a very inexperienced hiker/climber.
* He is not familiar with the area and likely would not have followed established trails.
* He is the father of two daughters.


Suggestion/Plea:

* If you are a hiker or climber in the Phoenix Area with experience, please consider a hike/climb to superstition today and perhaps with a pair of binoculars to help search.
* Please x-post this to any sub-reddit you think may help.
* I will update this when any new information is discovered.

Thank you very much!

Lucas

**Update 1**: Thanks so much for everyone willing to go out there and help in the search. I do think that Chris may have hard time assessing the real risk of situations. So that could have influenced the decisions he would have made regarding whether or not to continue hiking/ or make a climb. I would like to clarify that I would only ask experienced hikers/climbers to aid. I do not wish for anyone else to become injured or lost. S&amp;R has stated that they cannot have untrained searchers in the field. As of yet, he has not been found. S&amp;R has told my sister it can sometimes take up to a week to find a lost person in the mountains.

**Edit 2**: Updated map with last known location. Ship Rock &amp; Geronimo.

**Touching in**: There is no new news yet and S&amp;R think it may take a few days to find him.

**Update 2**:
&gt; Thank you to everyone helping look for my husband, chris. As of right now, they have a s&amp;r dog out looking, a rider on horseback and about 14 people on foot. They are trying to get a s&amp;r team on top and they plan on working through the night. Chris walked 3.5 miles to the mountain and told me he was not taking any trails. As much as I want him home with his family, please don't attemp to climb if you aren't experienced. 2 s&amp;r volunteers already got hurt and I don't want anyone else hurt. I know chris has the following items on him...a lighter, mace, his HTC phone (battery is dead), a dull hunting knife, a cannon cool pix camera and he was wearing black gym shorts with a thick red stripe down each side of the legs and black dc shoes. I believe he was wearing a baseball hat as well. He is 5'8 and 120 lbs. He doesn't have a shirt on (he took it off during his walk to the mountain and lost it on the way) but he has a dragon tattoo on his bicep, 2 chinese symbols on his stomach and a harley symbol with CMH on his upper back near his neck. He does have some medical issues, asthma being one, so if you see him, please call 911. I just want him home safe and sound. Again, thank you for your help, thoughts and prayers!",,False,self,t5_2qmpu,1366447826.0,,,True,t3_1cgy8j,http://www.reddit.com/r/phoenix/comments/1cgy8j/any_hikersclimbers_please_help_me_find_my/,

The gold Tahoe that hit me then pulled past me on the right side and took a right turn. He did not stop. He made a U-turn and hit another car in the process. Went north on Lakeshore. My wife phoned 911 and I followed. I had two little  5yr. old girls in my truck. The guy drove back through the school zone, weaving and driving erratically. Dispatch told my wife to have me pull over and stop. Fuck that. Fuck him. I continued to follow, and watch this guy pull up to a house, not before he smacked the neighbors car. I saw two little girls get out of his Tahoe, both in tears and shaken up. They had the same school shirts as my babies.  The guy let them in the house, and went back to his truck, opened all four doors while looking for something. The cops pulled in about that time and cuffed the guy. He was booked for Felony Agg.Dui and a couple other small charges. Keep your kids safe Phoenix/Tempe. Here is his ugly mug. http://i.imgur.com/bY64532.jpg

TL;DR: Drunk guy wrecks 3 cars picking his kids up from school on a Monday.Keep your kids safe even in a school zone. 


Edit 1: For those wanting to vote on his mug, click the ""dui"" tab. http://www.mcso.org/Mugshot/#

Edit 2: You guys are awesome. He's up to 8 votes and on the leader boad. Thank You for all the great comments and feedback! I posted this to vent, and I truly feel better!

Edit 3: You guys fucking rock! He's our ""mugshot of the day!"" winner! I don't know if that gets him anything where he's at, but it sure made me feel better about having my truck in the shop for a couple weeks!

I just got out of the hospital where I was diagnosed with Crohn's disease. I took a CareFirst cab to my house to find out while I was in the hospital not only did I get evicted my room-mate disappeared with my 360$(irrelevant amount) half of rent. I'm working day labor right now but I only have a suitcase of my belongings and no where to go. I haven't filed a police report yet. I'm hoping I'll hear from him.

I need help or advice; I don't have a family to turn too. My nearest relative is in South Carolina, but I don't know they would even take me in. Does anybody know any resources about how to get back on my feet until I get some paychecks back into my account(I haven't been working since I was hospitalized).

It seems every where I turn for help is for drug addicts or mentally ill people and I don't have either of those problems and would rather avoid that living situation(ie: worried I'll get hurt or my stuff will be stolen).

If you have any questions or can offer any advice or help please leave a comment I'll be here all day I have no where else to go.(I'm at a library at 1825 West Union Hills Drive, which is about 19th ave and union hills.) I have no money, but two hundred dollars in food stamps and about 8 bucks in gas.

		-Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution

Neighbors, our 4th Amendment rights are at risk.

As I'm sure you're all aware by now, it has recently been revealed that [the National Security Administration has demanded, and received, the phone records of millions of Americans](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/06/top-secret-doc-shows-nsa-demands-verizon-hand-over-millions-of-phone-records-daily/#p3).  In addition, they have immediate access to your [Google searches](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data), [Facebook accounts](http://intellihub.com/2013/06/09/how-google-facebook-skype-yahoo-and-aol-are-all-blatantly-lying-in-denying-nsa-spy-grid-scheme/), and yes, [even your emails](http://www.storyleak.com/second-nsa-spy-leak-govt-tech-companies-lying-to-you/).

As Americans, we cannot allow this to continue.  Protecting our rights is our moral imperative.

Don't get me wrong; I'm not suggesting a revolution of any kind.  In NO WAY do I advocate violence!  We can, and we MUST, *peacefully* encourage our Government to reverse these unconscionable actions.

This is not a partisan issue.  In this fight, there are no Republicans, no Democrats.  This is not a religious issue.  There are no Christians, no atheists.  This is not a fiscal issue.  There is no Tea Party, no Occupy.  There are only Americans.

This is not about the right to bear arms.  This is not about equality in marriage.  This is not about healthcare.  This is not about controlling the border.  This is neither Pro-Choice nor Pro-Life.  This is about our right to privacy.

Phoenicians, we need to set aside our differences and come together.  The time is now.  If we do not take action soon, we may find more and more of our rights being slowly whittled away until there are none left.  I encourage you all to subscribe to [r/restorethefourth](http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/).

Is there anybody here who has any activism experience?  Has anyone on this sub ever organized a protest?  If so, please respond in the comments!  Phoenix needs you!  *America* needs you!

I need to find Roy Arteburn, my grandpa.

He went missing about 7 hours ago. He was traveling alone to Phoenix Arizona to visit with his granddaughter and Great Grandson. He got on the flight in Houston, His bags were picked up in Phoenix, not sure by whom, but he was not picked up by my niece or her husband. Please Please Please call the authorities if you see him or have seen him. 

He is about 5'10"", about 190 lbs, forgetful and last seen wearing a long sleeve brown sweater. These are fairly recent photos of him from our wedding and family gatherings.

He traveled to Phoenix today (2-22-13) on United flight 339. 

Please share this with all of your Circles, Communities, and people you know in the greater Phoenix area.

I know there are lots of people that have connections PLEASE SHARE SHARE SHARE this as someone may have seen him and can help. 

THANK YOU!!!!!

Edit 2 w/ update:

We still don't have visual confirmation of him being in Phoenix except the account of flight officials saying they saw him on the plane and get off. After that, we lose total visual contact with him. We know that around 5:15pm, earlier tonight, he bought a flight out of Phoenix with his credit card, set to leave around 8:30am the next morning (2.23.13). Again, we don't know if he actually bought the ticket or if someone stole his information. 

We know that there are cameras around the airport but as of the last time I heard, they weren't willing to look at, or release the tapes to anyone. We're hoping to involve an FBI friend tomorrow morning to look at the tapes and see what we can find out. 

I personally have called several hotels in the area, including ones with airport shuttles and ones that have a golf course nearby (he loves golf.). No luck with him checking into any of them as of an hour ago. 

Edit 3 family update:

His credit card was used 2 hrs after he landed to book a hotel and after 4 hours it was used to book a flight. This was all done while family and police were searching and looking at the terminal. We have family waiting by the terminal for the purchased flight to see if he shows up. This all seems suspect as he always provides itineraries for all trips and notifies all of us. We are hopeful that he has just been a little forgetful instead of someone else using his ID and credit cards.
We have checked hospitals and hotels close to terminal- no luck. We also contacted United Air and asked that they have him contact us at check in .
We are all praying it was just a ""senior moment"" and he will show up.

So I made a list of some of the top threads I found on things to do, places to eat, and advice for moving/visiting here. I thought I'd keep this up to date and refer people here when they ask these questions.

Did I miss any key posts that I should add? Or categories? I thought about adding one for the music scene (venues and bands) as that comes up once in a while.

It was cheap and they threw a free upgrade to the Wednesday paper. 

So after a year we cancel when the promotion ended. We don't even read the paper, just wanted coupons. They now call 3-6 times a week from 9am to 8pm trying to sell us new subscriptions after 2 months of cancellation. We ask to be placed on do not call politely at least 3 times when we answered. We have repeatedly told them we are not interested in a paper subscription. 

Now they have started hanging up on us and getting rude. We cannot get them to stop calling. They say 1-2 weeks to be removed from the list. Apparently they do not know how to put down a phone or take a number out of their autodialer. They got really rude this week and hung up...we got pissed off and were going to report them. We tried calling right back but it was ""after hours""?? They called and woke us up twice this week. 

They double charged us not even a week after we called in to cancel. Charged for 2 subscriptions because one of their phone solicitors put in a fraudulent sale.

*TLDR: AZ Republic is fucking shady. I hope the internet puts them out of business. Do not give them your phone number.*",,False,self,t5_2qmpu,1355644568.0,,,True,t3_14xnbp,http://www.reddit.com/r/phoenix/comments/14xnbp/psa_az_republic_is_the_worst_company_in_the_valley/,

Of interest is that the DNS servers were attacked, allowing Cox customers to continue using services not dependent on DNS, such as torrents (and the LIOC) as well as allowing those who know how to change their DNS servers, returning internet access. In particular, Google's public DNS servers were mostly used. Statements found on several websites state that the attacks were a response to Cox's recent email barrage to customers telling them they would now be subject to a ""Data usage quota"", as well as statements from Cox that customer's WOULD find their internet connections shut off if they went over their quota.

    ACT*REGISTRATION DDA PUR ACT*REGIST 877-228-4881 CA~  	 -59.95 

When I searched the phone number 877-228-4881 I came up with a lot of results, the first of which [was this](http://www.whatsthatcharge.com/ACT-REGISTRATION-877-228-4881-CA). Sure enough, I signed up for the Color Run which uses Active.com registration. 

This is a 'Trial' membership that Active.com charges you for and then buries in a spamish email with the subject of '**You're All Set for a Full Year of Savings on Activities, Gear and Training**'... something I *MAY* have seen if this hadn't been sent to my wife's account (ok you got me, I didn't participate in the race, I just paid for it ;).

[Some further reading.](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;tbo=d&amp;output=search&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=active.com+membership+fee&amp;oq=active.com+me)

I'll follow up with more shortly. I am at work and need to handle some things. What a load of shit. I wonder if there is some fine print I missed. I'll let you know how it goes when I call them... and maybe the BBB.

Edit: The [checkout process](http://imgur.com/a/CI0KC), further demonstrating that I did not sign up for the 'trial membership' (see the receipt in image 4 vs the total in images 3 and 5).

Edit 2: They reversed the charge. They have a prompt specifically for this charge when you call.

Edit 3: [xd0nn4x points out](http://www.reddit.com/r/phoenix/comments/184opy/psa_to_all_those_who_enjoyed_the_color_run_check/c8bm7wn) that the website may have changed recently and there may have been a popup that asked you to 'confirm your email' which is where they hid the fine text. At this point I believe that this is the most likely scenario and that I fell for this 'conformation' which signed me up for the shady 'Membership'.

1356974213.0,46,self.phoenix,15qb0x,[Meta] A thought for growing /r/Phoenix in 2013 - Give vs Ask,jmoriarty,57,11,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/phoenix/comments/15qb0x/meta_a_thought_for_growing_rphoenix_in_2013_give/,"Looking at posts in this sub, the majority of them tend to be people asking for something: Where should I eat, Where can I find X, How do I, Can someone help me, etc. These are fine to a point, and there are some very helpful people who chime in, but it doesn't go very far to build a community. What motivates someone to check this sub regularly if the bulk of posts *want* something, versus presenting the opportunity to learn or see something new?

So my proposal is for people to try and post things that **Give** something to anyone reading it, rather than Asking. Could be a picture you took, favorite bands locally, a cool hangout, etc. Often I hear that people don't have anything to share, and I think that's bull. The Valley is huge, and we all have different views on it based on where we live, what we do, our hobbies, etc. Something that is old news to you is going to be interesting to someone else who didn't know it existed. I'm not saying ban Ask posts at all. I just would love to see Give posts outnumber them.

Make a goal of *once a month posting something new in this sub, in whatever area interests you*. Not to ask for anything in return, but just to share it with everyone else. I like the increased activity in the local subs over the past year, but if everyone made just twelve posts in 2013 that gave something out to the community, this could be a crazy good board by the time we circle the sun one more time.

Either way, have a great New Year!

**EDIT:** Glad people like the idea! If even the 37 net upvoters this has right now all stick to a once-per-month post, we've got the whole year covered. I'll post a bump/reminder every few months. I'm really looking forward to seeing what people share.

In case you, or someone you know is moving into the dorms at ASU Tempe campus, and you don't drive through the city often, here is a warning for you:

Due to hemorrhaging construction that has been going on for 3 months, Rural Road is down to one lane, with many no-turn signs from the Loop 202 down to Apache/Spence roads. With dorm move in beginning in a couple days, I wanted to make people aware of this situation. Rural Road is going to be a zoo, even more so than usual. 

If you are coming from the north or west valley, taking Priest to University east, then going south on Mill Ave and taking it around to Apache will get you on the south side of campus, and taking Priest to University east will drop you off on the north side of campus. South and east valley residents can take Broadway west across to Mill and turn north, then turning onto Apache or University east for south or north sides of campus.

Check your maps for other routes, but avoid driving on or across Rural at all costs. I've worked at ASU long enough to suggest other alternate routes if you need, just let me know.

My assumption was to crank up the A/C on Max setting and keep the windows up in an attempt to fill the cabin with cooler air. I couldn't have been more wrong.

The Max setting is recirculating the air so at first it's just going to recycle all that hot air inside the car, which is much hotter than the outside temperature, so opening the windows is the very first thing to do.

Roll those windows down and blast the regular A/C for at least a couple minutes to get cold air flowing and you may be on your way to air conditioned bliss in one or two miles instead of, you know, by the time you finally get home.

I may be /r/phoenix's biggest idiot for not knowing this sooner, but if I can help one person this summer, my work here is done.

Oh, and of course windshield shades and a steering wheel cover are must-haves, and I even keep a sock in the car (I'll wait while you make a joke...) for grabbing the gear shift and seat belt buckle.

&gt;A friend of mine alerted me to a gentleman who's missing and was last seen Sunday in Phoenix. [Please pass this link around to as many people as possible to see if we can help!!!](http://www.sciencequeen.com/daveposter.pdf)
&gt;
&gt;Thank you!
&gt;
&gt;Edit: More info: Dave McMillan, has been missing from Tempe/Phoenix, AZ since about 1:30am Monday morning. The major intersection he was closest to was South McClintock Drive and East Southern Ave.
&gt;He is from Vancouver BC. He was down visiting friends and disappeared in the middle of the night without his wallet or passport. He might have his phone on him but it doesn't work in the US. A missing person report has been filed.
&gt;
&gt;**Edit 2** From nomoon_
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Friend of Dave here. Here's the whole swack of information compiled from the facebook group where people are communicating about this:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;**The situation:**
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;* Dave DJ'd at a party on Saturday.
&gt;&gt;* He went back to his friend's house afterward.
&gt;&gt;* His friend left the apartment Sunday evening, and Dave stayed behind because he was tired.
&gt;&gt;* When his friend returned, Dave was gone.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;**Things we know:**
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;* He left behind everything: wallet, laptop, clothes and passport.
&gt;&gt;* He was last seen near the corner of E Southern Ave and S McClintock Dr.
&gt;&gt;* We don't think he had any money
&gt;&gt;* His phone does not work in the US/his carrier is FIDO.
&gt;&gt;* His laptop cable is missing
&gt;&gt;* He was wearing a red shirt and black cargo pants the last we saw.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;**Things that have been tried:**
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;* Tempe and Phoenix police/jails have been called. If the police had him for longer than 1.5 hrs, he could have been transferred to the jail serving Tempe and Phoenix, but no one claiming to be Dave or Canadian is on the jail's list. However, with no ID he could be lost in the shuffle (ie. using a different name or refusing to give one). (Aug.23)
&gt;&gt;* Hospitals called: Maricopa Medical, Desert Banner, Tempe St. Luke's, St. Joseph's on West Thomas Road, Banner Good Samaritan, Banner Baywood (Aug.23)
&gt;&gt;* The Canadian consulate has been contacted , and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. They have opened a file with Dave's name and have said they will be working with local law enforcement to help find him. (Aug 23)
&gt;&gt;* Local news has been notified.
&gt;&gt;* A missing persons report can't be filed until he's gone for 48 hours (1:30 am Wednesday)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Thanks to everyone getting the word out in the Phoenix area. Since Dave is from Vancouver BC, lots of us friends here are really worried, but also really limited in what we can do, being so far away.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;-- Thanks again everyone!

As you all must know by now, bras can be quite expensive. I recently went to the Nordstroms at the Scottsdale mall to have my bra fitted and it turned out I am not a 32B as I thought, but rather, a 32DD. I bought two bras on the spot: a darling black lace/t shirt bra and a nude strapless one. I walked out spending close to $150. For two bras. And let's be real here, I needed more than two bras if I was going to throw out all of the ones that no longer fit me.

So let me get down to it. Last Chance. Some people love it, some hate it. It's basically Nordstrom's last attempt at selling used/overstocked/damaged merchandise, and it is located in Phoenix off the 51 and Highland. And they have so many bras! In fact, when I went in a week after throwing down $150 on my bras, they had both of them in perfect condition there for $3.95 a pair. I bought both in different colors and then bought a few more. They are great. Not damaged or stained or gross by any means.

I know Last Chance has a cult like following, and you're likely to not find something you love unless you are willing to sift through the junk. But I wanted to share with you ladies this tip. I now have the two I spent $150 on, plus another 6 or so that I spend a total of $20 on. 

We all know the importance of having a quality bra that really supports your boobs, and often you have to sacrifice quality for frugality. This does not have to be the case!

Sorry if this isn't the best sub for this post. But I hope it helps one of you!",,False,self,t5_2qmpu,False,,,True,t3_10zimp,http://www.reddit.com/r/phoenix/comments/10zimp/dear_female_rphoenix_redditors_i_have_the_biggest/,

I thought it was my door and I went to look out the peephole and no one was there. It was someone banging on my upstairs neighbors door (condos). I then proceeded to look outside the windows and I didn't see any police cars or anything and it only sounded like 1 man. Thought that was quite odd and I started to think. While I was thinking the man was still banging on the door yelling the same things. ""IT'S THE POLICE"", ""OPEN UP"", etc. Finally he said ""YOU HAVE 5 SECONDS"" (my neighbors weren't home) so then I hear this loud bang. I was still looking out my peephole/windows and i heard the deadbolt fall onto their tile from upstairs and the door was kicked open. I went outside for a second and then slammed my door and went back inside.

I then knew something weird was goin on so I called the police. The police said there hasn't been any warrants issued in my area or any squad members in my neighborhood so they send over 3 officers. They tactically entered the home and found no one was there. It was indeed a break-in. Luckily no one was hurt and nothing was taken. I think I scared them off when I slammed my door. This was in North Scottsdale so please be careful out there guys. My sister got a glimpse of the person, she said he looked like [Jax(man on the left)](http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2008/09/18/sons_of_anarchy_continues_the_dysfunctio) from Sons of Anarchy, except a slight less build. I recommend you ask a neighbor to look out for sketchy things going on throughout the day because this is apparently the 4th break in in my area.

Just think hard-core coffee beverages, only cold and refreshing.

This operation will run out of the back of a converted pedicab or a dune buggy. I'm really pulling for the dune buggy. Because... dune buggy.

Any thoughts? Is this something you'd like to see? I'll also have fresh fruit, sodas (like [Reed's Ginger Brew](http://reedsinc.com/product/reeds-original-ginger-brew/)), and packaged food from local bakers (small cookies and brownies).

Earlier in the week, I was on a flight, where I started up a conversation with a passenger *(translation:  I saw a cute girl sitting by herself and couldn’t pass up talking to her.)*  Through our conversation, we discovered a similar love of travel, just for the sake of travel, among many other interests we shared.  We both have a spontaneous sense of adventure, so when I asked what I should do on my upcoming days off, I was given the following task:

**“A question and a mission for you, if you choose to accept it.  What makes Arizona and Phoenix in particular unique?  If you woke up in Arizona after being kidnapped and blindfolded, would you recognize it.  Answer in pictures on your days off.”**

So now I have homework.  How could I show everything I love about my adopted state and city in just two days?  I moved to Phoenix from the east coast last year, and have hundreds of photos from my travels throughout the state and the central valley.  I was originally going to limit this assignment to photos taken only on those two days I had off, but since this state and city offer so much, I’ll post photos I’ve taken those two days, plus other photos I’ve taken over the past year.

If I woke up, dropped into a random location in the state, or city, would I be able to recognize it?  Well, what unique sites does Phoenix have to offer?  What if I was dropped off in the middle of the desert?  Several states have deserts.  Hell, I could be in California, Nevada, or New Mexico, as well as others.  What makes Arizona unique?

We do have beautiful desert scenes after all:

There’s so much more I could post, the food, the nightlife, the arts scenes, Native America, etc.  I’m no professional photographer, and most of these photos were taken via camera phone, but what I’ve learned is it looks like I have much more exploring to do.

Also, we only have a limited amount of water guns, so if guys could bring your own it would be totally awesome. We have a balloon pump and some balloons.

You guys are more than welcome to join us, the more the merrier!

**What it is:** Arizona Beer Week is put on by the Arizona Craft Brewers Guild to showcase great Arizona beer, and fantastic craft beer from around the country. Info: http://arizonabeerweek.com/about/

**Strong Beer Festival:** This Saturday, it is the traditional kick-off for AZ Beer Week. For my money, this is the best price/value beer festival in Phoenix. Amazing beer from all over the US, including lots of specialty tappings. Info: http://arizonabeerweek.com/13th-annual-arizona-strong-beer-festival/

**Full Calendar of Events:** Lots of things are going on all over the Valley every day, including happy hours, cigar related events, BBQ events, fundraisers, and the inauguration of Four Peaks' new tasting room: http://arizonabeerweek.com/events-by-day/?date=2013-02-16

**New Times' Favorite Events:** Zach Fowle picked his favorite events for the week if you're trying to narrow it down. It's across multiple pages as *New Times* likes to do, but good info in here: http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/bella/2013/02/arizona_beer_week_calendar_best_events.php

**Get a Ride:** *Uber* is a company that runs like a taxi service, but dispatches limos to pick you up. Put their app on your smartphone and you can call a car to your location any time you need it. They're giving a $20 discount on your first ride until the 23rd with the AZBEERWEEK  So try them, get a designated driver, or anyone else, but drive safe: https://www.uber.com/cities/phoenix

Share any events you're going to and maybe we can get some impromptu meetups out of it. I'll be at the Strong Beer Fest on Saturday with bells (and pretzels) on!

I was friends with Frank since we were 12 years old. We literally were never apart. Even when we grew up we were at each others births of our children, we went out for beers at least a couple of times a month, etc. Late in August of 2010, we went out for beers because we hadn't hung out in awhile. We talked about everything to catch up, and he told me how he was driving his truck the weekend before and jackknifed it on a road near Flagstaff and about got killed in an accident. I told him he needed to stop driving and find something safer. Half joking, half serious. He already had a pre-teen daughter and he just found out a girl he had dated had a son and never told him. He went to court to fight to see his son and won. He was so happy about it.

Then a week after we went out this happened:

http://www.azfamily.com/news/local/Man-dies-after-getting-pinned-between-two-delivery-trucks-in-Phoenix-101659468.html

I was devastated. His family was devastated, and more importantly his 2 kids were without their dad. I still don't know specifics as to what happened or if he suffered. I know that he went to work that day at about 8am and they found him a little before noon. I also know that he was hooking up his trailer and got pinned between the trailers. I would almost guarantee it was because he had very little sleep and made a traggic mistake. This is the one thing that we were angry about. How could he do something so dumb? He knew better!!!

We had the funeral and his family had him cremated. They chose to have his ashes seperated into 4 places. One was spread out at their family cabin near Heber. One part was kept in the urn at his parents house. And the other 2 were made par of a piece of jewelry for his parents each to wear. His mom had a locket with a picture engraved into it with a bit of ashes placed in it. And his dad had a necklace made that had a vial of his ashes in it with a dragon on it. It was Frank's favorite mythical creature. I was with him when he got a giant one tattood on his leg.

Fast forward to this summer and this happens:

http://www.azfamily.com/news/Priceless-necklace-stolen-from-Phoenix-couples-home-179735131.html

I know the people didn't know that they were stealing something so personal but it doesn't matter. I've watched a person who I consider to be my second mom go through the emotions again of losing her son. I've watched my ""other"" dad cry and stop by several pawn shops every day for the past few months looking for the necklace. They've pretty much moved out of that house now that they lived in for 40 years. Junior's room, which is what they called him, still has everything there as it was when he stayed with them. Well except for the shotgun and handgun that the burglars took. And it did happen a few months ago but they had been trying to find it on their own until they asked the local news for help.

I'm asking people to put the word out about the necklace and help them get it back. They mean everything to me and when I watched the news story I couldn't help but go through all of the emotions of Frank being killed again. And that's nothing to what his parents feel. They're DEVASTATED again. Please help them find it by putting the word out. If you see some jewelery either out and about or at a pawn store, look for the necklace. They deserve to have it back, they've went through hell for the last 2 years with this. It's the one thing that's kept him near them.

We are trying to get in touch with them about getting the sketch of the necklace, but they've been in Heber. The sketch is in the video though if that helps. The area of town that it was stolen from was near 67th Avenue and McDowell. More specifically, 65th Avenue and Palm Lane. If you do find it, please contact Phoenix Police at 602-262-6151. You can also text a tip to Silent Witness at #274637

Please keep an eye out. It won't bring frank back for Frank Sr. and Susan, but it will help heal their heart a little bit.

UPDATE: Here's the necklace:

Details inside.",Blackbalisong42,36,9,60,http://www.reddit.com/r/phoenix/comments/18puaj/i_know_this_may_sound_dumb_but_i_am_obsessed_with/,"This is long, I'm sorry, so if you'd like to skip the BS, a TL;DR is at the bottom.

Again, I know this sounds dumb, and I apologize if this is the wrong way to go about asking this, but I've browsed this sub for a while and you all seem really nice so I figured I'd ask. Right now I am a 20 year old guy, about to start my education and have my whole life ahead of me, and I want to set my sights on moving to AZ soon. I flew into Phoenix and went to hike the Grand Canyon a few times over the past few years and ever since my first time, I've fallen in love with the state and cannot see myself living anywhere else when I 'become an adult,' so I'm really thinking hard now.

So, about me: I'm a 20 year old guy living right outside of Philadelphia, PA. I am aiming to have a career in IT, and am looking to start getting my associates degree this summer. I work full time right now in a manual labor job, but that combined with taking classes, I should be done my Associates in less than two years, focusing on computer networking technology. 

Now, that is where I come to a crossroads. I either have my associates and stay here and complete a BA at a university (it'd most likely be Temple University in Philly), or take that associates and move out to AZ to start fresh. The degree program would prepare me to have an entry level job in network administration, maybe help-desk work, tech support, anything like that (and I'd do my best to get certifications on the side too). That would hopefully be good enough to get started no matter where I am located, so I figured why not do it where I want to live anyway? So, I guess what I'm asking is, how difficult would it be for me to make the move to Phoenix and essentially start new?

Even if I didn't get a job in IT right off the bat, I'd be willing to work any job as long as it supports me living there. Maybe I could work a job for a while, whatever it may be, and save up enough to get more schooling at a school in the area. Or maybe the associates/work will be enough as is. So what is the cost of living like? That is, for a 20-something? Ideally of course, I'd get a job in IT, so does anyone have a general outlook on the job market there?

I know that a lot of people might advise against it for some reasons, like of course the heat and living conditions...and call me crazy, but I love the idea of that. Like I said, I've visited before in some capacity, and that is one of the aspects I look forward to most, the outdoors! Of course summers are brutal, but one thing that sounds great is the fact that you can drive north for a few hours and there are amazing hiking opportunities, and camping, rock climbing, an abundance of things! All in all, I am just so excited about moving there, and was wondering if anyone had any advice on how I could do that, in relation to getting settled with jobs and such. Thanks so much!

*EDIT: Also, like I said, for a while when I get there I'll most likely have to start working some other job while I find an IT related one (unless things work out one hundred percent), so what kind of jobs could I look for that I could get without a degree? Anyone able to support themselves on 'regular' jobs? For some reason I've always thought I'd dig the hotel industry haha, or work in a bookstore or something random like that. Any suggestions?

**TL;DR**: I'm a 20 year old guy living in Pennsylvania right now, and am looking to move to Phoenix (or anywhere nearby) soon. I am going to get my associates degree in IT here, then with that hopefully move out there. How hard would it be to get an IT job? I'd be willing to work any job to get started, also.

I’ve been bored as shit at my work and have been dinking around craigslist for another job.  I find myself real drawn to Phoenix even though I have never been there.  What attracts me is the year round weather and the affordable housing.  I currently live in WA and I fantasize about coming home from work and enjoying a nice pool in the sun despite what month it is.  And, holy shit, your homes are cheap. 

I know it’s all subjective and yeah, it’s freaking hot in the summer, there are scorpions, and trees only exist where people water them.  I get that.  But is there something I don’t know?  Do you Phoenix transplants regret moving there?  For reference, I'm married with a small child.

And a more specific question-  I’ve noticed a pile of real cheap and newish housing in either San Tan Valley, Surprise and also parts of South Phoenix.  I know that these places are on the periphery of the metro area.  But all of the jobs that would fit me have been in Scottsdale.  Would I be setting myself up for commuter’s hell or is traffic alright?

Thanks for any comments.

Edit- I appreciate everyone's input.  Im kind of surprised by the quantity of replies.  I've read them all, even if I haven't responded.  Thanks again.

**To those of you I have planed to work with:** I still want to do the work for you all. But! If you know of anyone who can benefit from it more (thanks to an amazing person), I would rather give them the opportunity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


I am 24/m, living in downtown phoenix, but willing to drive to anywhere. I am trying to make it on my own. I've had a rough month and I'm afraid that I will not be able to cover my bills this month...

I am happy to do anything. I don't have a truck so I can't haul stuff. But I can do yard work, cleaning, painting, cooking, computer repair/building/etc, courier, chauffeuring (DD anyone?!) I love all animals (I'm pretty decent at training dogs), random handy man work, and anything else (within reason; grossness is not a factor!). 

*(more info in the edit below)*

I currently work part time and my schedule is very flexible.
I pride myself in the work that I do, and I don't like to cut corners. 
I have a car so transportation is not a problem.

If you could ask friends and family if they need help with anything I would totally appreciate that!

Thank you all for reading. I truly hope something comes of this. (read: need)

Have a great day!

**Please PM me, or leave a comment below and I will get in touch with you! Again, thank you!!**


**EDIT:**

I figured I'd post some of my responses from below and from PM's, for a bit more info that may, or may not be helpful:

* I can usually cover my bills, but this month I got hit with a bad case strep, and I have no insurance. That killed my savings, and put me out of work for a bit. I don't mean to give you my sob story.(I didn't put it in my original post for that reason.) 

* I just did the math. I'm just shy of needing $150, and I have about 12 days to come up with the money.

*  I would say that I am great at cooking. I didn't go to culinary school or anything, but I can do most things. If   put in a room full of staple ingredients and some proteins, I can make a delicious meal!

* For computers, I have done years of pc repair, building, upgrading, troubleshooting, consulting, consolidating, organizing, media server setup, etc. I've also done a lot of work with helping people making the jump from pc to mac. I've also work a lot with macs clients, similar to what I've done with pc. I am very familiar with the ins-and-outs of each of their operating systems. Same goes for the iPhone as well(anything and everything) (ps. I have friends at Apple stores what are always helpful). I started to learn programming but I much rather enjoy teaching people on how to better use their computers (people usually not found on reddit, haha). I don't have any cert, but I could pretty easily get some. Just never gotten around to it.

* Current work: I work parttime for a company that contracts with food manufacturers to do their vending work and other various projects. When working, I am in and out of grocery stores, walking the aisles making sure things look good and working with store managers to make any needed corrections. I drive a lot and my schedule is very flexible. 

**Extra Info:**
Times that I am not available:

mon/wed - nights (5:40pm-9pm)

tues/thurs- mornings (8:30am-9:45am)

Other than that, I am pretty much free for whenever is best for you.

My work schedule is on a 'just get it done when you can' schedule, making it very flexible.

We have 1 month before the end of the year, and there are some nice tax credits in Arizona.  Time to start planning now!  [Arizona Department of Revenue Tax Credits](http://www.azdor.gov/TaxCredits.aspx).  [Tax credit forms and instructions](http://www.azdor.gov/Forms/Credits.aspx) will need to be included in your return.  2012 forms are not final.

**Note:**  These are *nonrefundable* tax credits.  I'll explain toward the end of my post.

[Working Poor Tax Credit](http://www.azdor.gov/TaxCredits/WorkingPoorTaxCredit.aspx) is a dollar for dollar credit (up to $200 for single filers, $400 for married filing joint) on your Arizona return.  **This credit only applies to taxpayers who itemize deductions.**

[Public School Tax Credit and Private School Tuition Tax Credit](http://www.azdor.gov/TaxCredits/SchoolTaxCreditsforIndividuals.aspx#public).  These are 2 separate credits even though they are listed on the same page.  There is no itemization requirement for either credit.  The Public School Tax Credit is a dollar for dollar credit up to $200/$400.  The Private School Tuition Credit is a dollar for dollar credit up to $1,003/$2,006.

[Arizona Military Family Relief Fund](http://www.azdvs.gov/benefits/relief_fund.aspx). [Donation Form](http://www.azdvs.gov/Departments/MFRF/MFRFDontationForm2012.pdf).  Maximum credit is $200/$400.  No itemization requirement **but** only the first $1 million donated to the organization is eligible for the tax credit.  As of yesterday over $595,000 was donated.  The credit will run out very fast.  Taxpayers cram donations at the end of the year.

Basically what you are doing with these credits is directing what organizations/programs/schools receive your state income tax.  Donate $200, lower your tax bill $200.

**Nonrefundable Tax Credits** are tax credits you only receive if you pay tax.  The tax credits cannot reduce your tax liability for the year below $0.

[Earned Income Tax Credit](http://www.irs.gov/Individuals/EITC-Home-Page--It%E2%80%99s-easier-than-ever-to-find-out-if-you-qualify-for-EITC) aka EIC.  This is a **refundable tax credit** available on your federal return.  Even if you have a $0 tax liability for the year, you may still receive a ""refund"".

Here's the great thing about the AZ tax credits:  They're all deductible on your federal schedule A as charitable contributions.  You can lower your federal bill while paying the same in AZ.  This effectively decreases your overall tax payment.

This list of credits is simply to help you identify where you can benefit the most from making contributions.  I do not want anyone to think that I'm trying to redirect their donations.  These can be used in addition to any giving you already do every year (if your cash flow allows).  Purely an informative post that I wanted to put together.

Also, I have to add this disclaimer.  It just means the taxing authority won't give a sh*t about what you heard on an internet post.  This should be implied anyway.

I think he was abandoned or something because he seems to be well-mannered (aside from typical puppy behavior like chewing and jumping). He knows how to sit and he seems to be house-trained also.

My cousin has expressed some interest in adopting him and told me that he'd let me know for sure after he thinks it over for a few days.

If that doesn't pan out, we still have another option. I found out that there is a way you can get stray dogs into AZ Human Service. They aren't allowed to take strays but they can take in abandoned dog. So if you tell them that the dog was abandoned (basically say something like you found them in the neighbor's back yard after they moved out or something) then they can take the dog in. So we'll do that if my cousin ends up not being able to adopt him.

I'm going to be pretty sad when we give him up because I've already become pretty attached to him. He's a great dog! It's too bad that we can't afford to keep another one!",,False,self,t5_2qmpu,False,,,True,t3_124v42,http://www.reddit.com/r/phoenix/comments/124v42/update_wife_and_i_found_a_dog_anyone_want_to/,

Well I kinda of have a way for you to do both. I realize most people will brush this off if it's too long so I'll keep the important stuff short and then add the rest after. Also this is a self post, so no karma is to be had. 

Basically I'm about to be in between apartments for a couple of weeks starting on the 31st of this month. I'll be staying with a friend who has cats so I can't have my dog with me there. The one person that could watch her bailed on me and I have no one else I could crash with while I try and hustle up the money for a new place. I'm already going to be losing a lot of my belongings due to lack of money/nowhere to store my things, etc.... the last thing I want to do is lose my dog too. I'm in the Tempe/Phx area in Arizona.

I have no idea what breed or age my dog is. I found her nearly dead on the street and nursed her back to health. You can read about it [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/lnnc5/this_is_danger_girl/). It never got much attention but the little info I did get from the post helped me in bringing her back to good health. She's amazing with people, kids, other dogs, fully potty trained, and quiet. She's sincerely the best damn dog I've ever had. She's my everything. She was just what I needed in my life. Oh, and her name is Deneva Dangerfield.

I'm in a tough spot because I have no car, no money, and I'm between homes. I'm not asking for money, a place to stay, or a place to keep my things. All I want is to know that someone out there wouldn't mind taking care of the most important living thing in my life while I try to get said life back in order. 

I'll post additional info about her in the comments so that my initial post isn't so long that it deters people from giving it attention.

Working on uploading some pics now, will edit when complete.

So I ask you, reddit... Do any of you fine ladies and gentlemen think you'd be okay with taking care of my Danger for a little bit? If not, please upvote this post. I'd honestly rather die than lose her. She really does mean everything to me.


UPDATE: Hey guys! I just wanted to thank you all for your kind words and support and let everyone know that someone was kind enough to take my little furball for a bit while I get my life together and get settled into a new place! I'll be updating again once I get her back and get settled into my new place with her! I love you all and thanks again for being so great. Stay classy, reddit!

EDIT: More current pics of her [HERE](http://imgur.com/GqMOo) and [HERE](http://imgur.com/X8eW2)

EDIT2: I'll be packing and cleaning all night and into tomorrow but I'll be checking back here every hour or so to see if anything has changed.

My wife Courtney and I want to take you out for breakfast for part of a project we're doing (it is also our honeymoon): 'Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America'.  Wanna be our breakfast stranger on December 5th in Phoenix?

More about the project:

* [Breakfast with Strangers mainsite](http://breakfastwithstrangers.com)
* [BWS Facebook page - please like us](http://facebook.com/BreakfastWithStrangers)  

Let us know in 500 words or less why you'd be the awesome breakfast interview as we travel across the USA. Please include 'Phoenix' in the subject line. Send an email to: breakfastwithstrangers@gmail.com.


**More details about our project**

On July 18, 2012 we hit the road from Portland, OR bound for Portland, ME (and back) and all places in between. Our camper van will serve as our home and mobile recording station on wheels for the next several months. Our route is going to snake east across the northern section of the USA and then snake back to Oregon along the southern route. We're gonna try our best to move with the good weather. 

Throughout our journey, we’ll blend old-fashioned and contemporary connection as we seek out strangers in a variety of ways: bulletin boards, classifieds, flyers, word of mouth, Facebook, Twitter, Craigslist, Reddit, CouchSurfing, pure chance, and more. We’ll build community and engage local media outlets along the way.


**Why Have Breakfast with Strangers?:**

America is polarized. We feel that part of this civic problem is the lack of strangers connecting with strangers. We want to change this—or at least challenge it in our own small way—by taking strangers out to breakfast across America. We’ll share local diner fare and conversation, learning what our new friends think about life’s big and little questions. We’ll chronicle these conversations in our blog so that strangers can meet strangers—virtually. Our project will foster connection, conversation, community, and commonality, culminating with a book: Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America. Here's a video we made when we launched our project: https://vimeo.com/44696027

In appreciation,

The room is 10x10.5 and has a private bath, plantation shutters, fan and a nice sized closet. The house was built in 1995 and is located near Cooper and Elliot. It's a great neighborhood not too far from the 60 or the 101, restaurants and shopping is also nearby. The house has a pool, three car garage, laundry room, laminate floors downstairs and newer carpet upstairs. Rent includes access to the whole house, including the 60' plasma w. surround sound and a garage space that can fit a small car, or any extra furniture/stuff you have.


About us: my long-time girlfriend and I own the home. We are in our mid 20s and love cars, traveling and outdoor activities. We are pretty easy going and clean but not OCD. We have a three-year-old shar-pei lab mix. She is very sweet and well behaved, she doesn't bark unless there is trouble, doesn't go on furniture and stays downstairs. So you must like dogs and are open to a roommate who has a dog, so long as your pet is also well behaved and gets along with our dog. Cats unfortunately are not OK due to allergies (blasphemy, I know). 


We are looking for either male or female roommate who is a student or also a young professional. We are gay friendly and OK with alcohol and having friends/significant others over, so long as you are respectful.

Rent: **$600** and includes private bath, gas, electric, water, internet and garage spot.

We started calling her Beardy for the gray fur around her mouth. My girlfriend and I noticed that when she would eat she favored one side of her mouth and despite getting regular food she was very skinny and never seemed to put on weight. We were finally able to capture her and take her to the vet who diagnosed her with [FIV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feline_immunodeficiency_virus), [gum disease, and problems with her teeth](http://www.carolinasanimalhospital.com/FILES/FELINELYMPHOPLASMACYTIC-1.pdf)(PDF warning). She is otherwise healthy, not immunocompromised, normal appetite. We brought her back from the vet and we're currently letting her live in our guest bathroom while we administer antibiotics and feed her wet food in the hopes that she'll put on some weight.

Here's where our request comes in: the vet is recommending that all of her teeth be pulled, which comes with a price tag of over $600. This is more money can the two of us can afford to pay no matter how much we might like the cat. In addition, we already have two cats of our own and adding a third cat with FIV is not in the cards.

**Does anyone have any suggestions on how to get help for her?** We've contacted two rescue groups but have received very little response. Are there any other groups who might be willing to assist?

We've covered her initial vet bills and are willing to get her spayed and vaccinated. We're happy fostering her for the time being but we have to keep her separated from our other cats. [Here's her info from the vet.](http://imgur.com/rzKHpfA)

We're confident that she would make a great companion for someone who understands her needs. She's still a little shy around people; she'll hiss once or twice as you walk up to her but she's never acted aggressively toward anyone. She loves being brushed and will start purring as soon as you start petting her.

My girlfriend has suffered from endometriosis for around 6 years now, and was officially diagnosed around 2 years ago. She has had surgery, she will be having another in mid-2013. 

She has horrible bouts of pain, the kind where I have to hold her while she cries, and the pain affects her on a constant basis, not just when she is on her period.

We have been to around 6 or so doctors, through 2 GP's and another 4-5 Gynos, oh and a pain specialist, and no one will prescribe her anything to help with her pain.

Every doctor she visits will write her up for 10 low strength percoset, sometimes 15, and they expect that to last her for a month.

No matter how much she complains to them about her pain, or about how hard it is for her to work 8+ hour days on her feet, or how she can't sleep some nights because she is stuck in the fetal position crying, they just don't care. 

Phoenix, please please help me find a damn doctor that will stop telling her ""Well, I don't want you to use pain killers frequently, so here are a few. Good luck."" and will help her. 

I can't stand seeing her this defeated. I would be lying if I told you I don't actually get pissed off about this. I want to walk in there and slap her damn doctor... I can't take it anymore. 

I'm either GOING to find her a doctor that will help her, or I am going to find someone to buy pain killers from illegally. I'd much rather do it the right way, but I can only take so much, and I absolutely can't stand watching her suffer like this needlessly.

Thanks for all the great answers!! Turns out there was a very lovely 'Mexican-themed' bar/grill just outside our gate (terminal 3/Delta) that began serving at 6AM. I had a lovely Long Island Long Tea when they lacked the materials to craft an Old Fashioned. 

After researching the 'bring your own mini bottles' path, I've learned it's a federal offense to pour your own drink on the airplane (there seems to be some debate over whether a flight attendant can pour it for you, but regardless) and while I could surely be super-stealth about it, I've decided not to risk that and tr THIS modified version of the method instead::

Buy mini bottles - throw in liquid baggie thru TSA checkpoint - purchase (2) soda pops from in-concourse concession shops - dump out some soda from each - pour liquor into each - pack in carry-on bag/carry onto plane in my hand. (Throw away mini bottles before boarding flight.)

I recognize the laws are there to keep people from getting out of hand at 50,000 (exaggeration) feet and having prior job experience dealing with drunks I respect that. This way, worst case scenario, I can chug my soda as I walk on the plane and keep the other sealed until I land.

Moving to your city around June and had a couple questions. I’ll be working in Midtown Phoenix (near Thomas and Central) and I like a more urban lifestyle, so I figure living in Downtown Phoenix would have me near work and in a neighborhood I like- specifically the Roosevelt Historic District. My questions are:

1) The 3 apartment complexes I’m looking at are Roosevelt Square, Skyline Lofts, and one with no name near Roosevelt and 7th Ave. I know ASU Downtown is near the first two buildings...are these buildings full of college students? I will be working long hours (typically start work around 6am) and probably 1 weekend day per week. I would prefer to live in a quieter place. 

2) I firmly believe in the work hard/play hard mentality. The buildings I listed above are all near light rail, which is convenient in case I come home stumbling at 2am or have to be at work at 5am and want some time to actually wake up. Roosevelt Square is right off the rail stop, but Skyline Lofts and the building near Roosevelt and 7th Ave are about half a mile from the light rail. How much am I gambling with my life walking in these neighborhoods at 2am without my full mental faculties? I've looked at crime maps and the neighborhoods don't look bad at all. For reference, I used to live in NYC (92nd and 2nd) and would occasionally make the .7 mile walk home from the subway at odd hours of the night while hammered. 

3) I’m open to other suggestions if you have any. I’m 26 , have a car, and absolute maximum rent would be $1300 (but the lower the better!). I’d prefer Downtown near a rail stop, but that’s not absolutely mandatory.

In any case I look forward to meeting you guys at a Reddit meetup. Thanks!

Her name is Kiki, she's 6 years old and a collie lab/terrier mix (I don't remember what the sign said). I had called the gal to let her know where I saw her pooch a couple hours after seeing the dog, but this is due to not having seen said sign until a couple hours after the fact. She and her family looked where I said I saw her, however, she was nowhere to be found at that time.
I'm losing sleep over it because I feel bad for the dog. She's been lost since New Years Eve. Please make no mention of my username or any details, I want no recognition for her being found.
If you find Kiki, please pick her up and take her home, then call (602) 330-5173 and let her know where she can pick up her lost best friend and family member. When I saw her at the bus stop, the dog was very loving, but also looked extremely hungry.

Every time I find a place that I can stand to look at, it's either way over budget, bug infested (allegedly), or in a gangbanging boonietown. Granted, not many people take the time to write positive reviews, but roaches multiply! And I'd much rather deal with rude staff so long as I don't wake up to a bug on my face or have to patrol for scorpions every night. I just started a new job that has upped my commute to nearly an hour and I just want to move!

Redditors, in what apartments have you lived that you are happy with? Where have you lived, scorpion-free, roach-free, behind the safety of gates and background checks, near great bars, and without breaking the bank?

Budget is about $900/mo for a 2-bed. Wanting Camelback corridor/Biltmore/Central corridor or *safe* downtown (2 females).

I tried searching for similar topics, but all I found were for short stays. At the moment we don't know whether we'll be staying in Phoenix for two weeks, or maybe a week there and a week somewhere else.

The main reason to be visiting is to go watch a couple of Suns games. Been a fan of them for a while, and being from England I haven't exactly had a chance to see them. I'm wondering if people can recommend some other places to see, or places to avoid.

Also are there any nice places to stay? I know most of you live in Phoenix, so probably won't have that much of a bearing on the best hotels and stuff but anything would be helpful.

Thanks in advance for any help, and I apologise for the maybe frequent question.

I'd like to encourage others to make the same resolution, or at least reconsider whether you MUST see some stupid movie like The Dark Night Rises in its first run at the theater and instead spend that $20 at a local Improv.

I'll also be checking here (Reddit) to see what is happening locally and whether its any good or not, so help me out.

* Super nachos/carne asada nachos. A big take-out container of chips covered in beans, carne asada, cheese, sour cream, guacamole, onions. Typically runs about $7.50. 

I've picked up that you can order a ""half order"" of super nachos. You save a buck or two, depending on location. You get slightly less, which most people waste anyways. 

* HOV/Carpool lane. Two or more *people*. People include babies. 

Only HOV or hybrids can use the carpool lane from 6 AM until 9 AM and 3 PM until 7PM. Outside of those hours, *anyone* can use these lanes. 

* Best cheesesteak (I've had): Forefathers in Chandler. Down the street from  my work. Get it with grilled onions and bacon (my favorite). Not a fan of the ""pizza"" fries, but the cheese fries are awesome.

Now I understand that their are people who steal cards and packages at this time of year to supplement their income before the holidays but normally they target your home mailbox. This time I think it might be a little different. Last week I mailed something like fifty Christmas cards and did it in person as the two cards that were returned had some pictures and needed extra postage. So I trekked down to my local Post Office at 1902 West Union Hills Drive here in Phoenix, AZ and waited in line. I guess the Post Office employee I handed them to decided that because they were heavy there must be a gift card or something valuable inside, now I understand why she tried to bend the envelope as she was mailing them. If I remember correctly opening another persons mail is a federal crime punishable with up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

I'm fostering a beautiful dog that was saved from the shelter who was about to be put down - he was on the euthanasia list. 

He is a great dog! 

He walks very well at my side on the leash, doesn't pull, doesn't try to chase critters, and does not bark at other dogs  - even if they are barking at him. In general, he doesn't really bark at all. 

He is super cuddly! He loves to be pet and will put his head in your lap for love and affection. 

He is still young and a bit of guidance is still needed, and would do best in a house with a yard to play in.

I currently have him in my one room apartment and the poor guy is way to big to be in here. He gets along great with my cats (doesn't bother them at all) and my 5lb. min pin - whom he is also too big for. Because of this I've been having to crate him more than I'd like to.

I'm really hoping he finds a home ASAP! The adoption place I'm working with has an application, or you can also send me a PM/comment if you'd like to know more.

I'm located in North Phx, Deer Valley (101 &amp; 17) area.

A while back I asked /r/phoenix if anyone could house my car for the summer. That ended up not working out due to my schedule, and I needed to ship my car from New Jersey to Phoenix. Well, even though it was supposed to leave the lot on July 25th, as of today it still hasn't, meaning I will be car-less when I arrive in Phoenix on August 12th. 

My original plan was to drive from Phoenix to Bagdad on the 13th, but this probably isn't going to happen. I start work in Bagdad at the mine on August 19th, but need to be there early for a physical and drug test.

Plus side? You are driving to a small mining town, roughly 1800 people. It's a pretty cool place since it is entirely based upon mining. I'll also pay you for gas, mileage, and extra. I'll even buy you a meal at the town restaurant.

Down side? You will be driving out two hours, having a meal, and driving back. You could probably stay the night if you wanted, but it'd be on the floor of the trailer I'll be living in, since it will be completely unfurnished.

We have been overpaying b/c of pets and we are now out of money (last hotel blocked $450 on my cc and we have been told it may not get released until mid next week).  Thursday we get paid again and things will be quickly resolved; however, I need help finding a place for my pets so we can stay with friends in the area.  I have 3 dogs and 1 cat.  Any help would be appreciated as I think we can stay with friends with the cat.  I have an older american-eskimo/husky mix (30ish lbs) and he is very calm and good with people.  Likes walks and lounging.  I have two cockapoos (one is mix with yorkie) both about 5-6 lbs.  The Yorkie mix is 6 months old, adorable, and playful. The other one is older and calm.  Also likes walks and lounging.  The younger one likes to play.
I can't pay anything up front, but I can pay on Thursday and I swear I won't leave my dogs.  I get paid Thursday and my wife gets paid Friday and her paycheck is new income.  So this really is very short term need.  Additionally, if the cc money comes back before Thursday then we'll change plans.
Alternatively, if you have a small mother-in-law apt or something you can let us use for up to 5 days.... I'm willing to pay for that too, unfortunately I'm broke until Thursday.  :)
I know I'm asking a lot, but I've seen redditors do great things for people, and I know when I had the resources I've always been willing to help when I could.  So, I'm hoping someone is willing to be inconvenienced a bit... ok, quite a bit.  :)  Thanks so much for advice or comments.

The owner sold off the business and I was cut out of the deal, so I now have these assets and I'm not doing anything with them. All inquiries just go to a dead line. I turned off the tap, so to speak. 

Now I know this is a long shot, but due to a series of extremely unfortunate and untimely events, I am in desperate need of some car parts. 

My girlfriends car was totaled a few weeks back when someone hit us on the I17, and we were left with just my vehicle. Then my clutch grenaded! 

I have the car half apart right now, do sending it off isn't much of an option anymore. All I need are parts. 

I still have access to a commercial account with autozone, which in the past would have been perfect for this situation because I could get the parts on a net 30 payment. But since I'm not longer doing business with the LLC that owned the account, I can only do cash-buys on commercial parts now. 

So I know I'm shooting in the dark here, but I've literally got nothing left to lose by trying here: would anyone be interested in bartering? 

I'll need less than $500 in parts. One time. I'd be willing to brand the website with your brand, set up all the call forwarding and email forwarding to you, and forward all of the other domains to this website for you. 

$500 is what I used to charge just to set someone up on Google Places. Oh how things change! Haha

I'm looking for assistance finding work. I have been unable to find work in the Phoenix area, owing to my lack of job history.

I was in the Naval Seabees and was stationed in both Puerto Rico and Okinawa.

I think my lack of job history has been hurting me here. It has been nearly 6 years since I last had a job and I've been in and out of school in the meantime.  While attending classes i helped someone move and injured my stomach and back and i just found out that i also have a neck issue that more tests will reveal exactly what is wrong. The VA nor my schools have been able to find me work. My school/studies are leaning towards Medical Administration, but I've also been unable to find work in that field.

Can any of you recommend any other places I can try? Do any of you know anyone that's hiring? I've tried everything from fast food to technical support type jobs and no one will hire me. I'm desperate. Nothing has been working out and it has been dragging me through the mud.

Important notes:

* I do not have a vehicle (dependant on public tansportation)
* I can do very little physical work due to back and neck injuries",,False,self,t5_2qmpu,False,,,True,t3_1f3x00,http://www.reddit.com/r/phoenix/comments/1f3x00/looking_for_work_in_the_tempemesa_area/,
