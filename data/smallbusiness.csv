1375314122.0,104,self.smallbusiness,1jgh8y,Got a call from Yelp.com today...,BostonCab,111,7,60,http://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1jgh8y/got_a_call_from_yelpcom_today/,"So I own a small taxi co started it myself love it...blah blah yada yada..
I am no stranger to yelp and it's problems. I am only glad that things are not as bad for transportation businesses as they are for the restaurants. This thread is not at all about their review filter but more so about their sales practices. 

The yelp rep has been calling me for a little over a week. I am sure this is because I edited my listing recently and it must have set off some kind of flag to call and try to sell me. 

So for a week this guy is calling leaving messages on a phone line my drivers refer to as ""the fuggin azzhole hotline"" one of them noticed it was the number I give people I have no interest in speaking to and named it that. 

So a week the guy calls leaves a message I call him back and leave a message. Today I see the line ringing and its lit up 212 area code so I knew it was probably him. I answered and we exchanged pleasantries and he went on to inform me that my yelp profile was driving LOTS of traffic to my business and he wanted to ""set up a time"" where we could go over how to drive ""WAY MORE"" traffic to me.. ""flood me with customers"" I said ""how much traffic""?  he says ""LOTS"" I say ""no seriously how much traffic has yelped pushed to me so far this month"" he dances a bit and I can hear him looking it up clicking keys (this is where I start to get heated, you have called my business office 4 times in a week and you don't have me in a notebook with some quick metrics about my business?) 
He says ""I see right here 32 views and 9 customer actions"" I literally chuckled. I get upwards of 10,000 calls a month. This guy sent me 32 of them huh? I guess I should just let him pet my dog and kick my cat huh? 

So not taking a breath he goes on to tell me he wants to ""schedule a time where we can sit down together in front of computers and talk about how much traffic he can push to me"" I responded ""I am here now. I am well versed in ppc ppa cpm what can you tell me?""

He says well ""how is 4pm today for you?"" huh? You called me 4 times this week to SELL me and you don't have a set of packages in your cheat sheet ready to throw at me? 

He sense me getting angry and says ""Well whey don't I call you back in 6 quick minutes and i`ll have something put together for you"" Now I am HEATED. ""My friend do you really work for yelp"" ""yes I do and I want to drive..

I cut him off.. ""yelp more or less makes their living off of small business listings right? You should have lots of experience with this right?""  ""Yes which is why I want the opportunity to schedule.. ""

So you know I run a small business do all the marketing book keeping..all of it on my own you called me 4 times in one week to try to sell me and now that you have me you are totally unprepared to sell me and are now being rude enough to try to sell to me at your convenience? ME. The small business owner who has no time for foolishness.. ""?

""Buddy,

I am not sure what it is you think you are selling with the 1 star extortion shuffle you got going on but you are rude arrogant and your company is disgusting. Good day to you sir""

I guess that review filter will be turned up to double plus stun now huh?

1374618490.0,73,self.smallbusiness,1iwz05,Just Got my First 1-Star Review on Yelp,snouzer,80,7,98,http://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1iwz05/just_got_my_first_1star_review_on_yelp/,"Here's a background about my small retail business I started. About a couple months back, the doors to my small massage/reflexology store opened. Because of the heavy competition (Foot massages are very common in Southern California now), I made sure that customer service, cleanliness and our services were tiers above everyone else, even our price beat neighboring competitors who didn't offer as much as us. The point was to show everyone that we were not only cheaper, but better in every way compared to other choices.

Well, about a month ago, someone on Yelp contacted me and told me they worked there for over 5 years already and knew about how Yelp could help me about. I knew about Yelp since 2008, when I started yelping myself. Never became an elite but several friends have. I told her that I knew Yelp was a valuable tool but I felt like we weren't ready to start advertising with them since I hadn't hired enough quality therapists yet to start promoting big. She said she'd call me back in a week and touch base. During the call, she explained how there were 19 other active massage/reflexology businesses on Yelp within 5 miles and how I needed Yelp in order for an upper hand against these 19 other choices. I checked on Yelp and there were only about 6 competitors, only 2 had reviews for them. I thought it was weird, but thought nothing of it.

Last night, after getting back from the store, I checked Yelp to find a huge negative review left for my store.. I checked my sign-in sheets looking for the customer, but never found the customer. The profile for the review was created within the same hour the review was posted and there was nothing else filled out on the profile, just a picture that looks like it could've been pulled off of anywhere (instagram? even reddit). I replied the best I could, but I thought it was highly suspicious how an account could be created, a negative review written and it becomes a permanent review as opposed as a ""filtered"" review. My past experiences doing web reputation for companies has taught me that creating an account on Yelp and writing any review right away would automatically flag it as ""filtered"" until you prove yourself otherwise that you're not spam through more reviews, check-ins, etc. This profile, had nothing.. not even a check-in at my small store. 

I've flagged the comment, flagged the profile, and done all that I could. I even reached out to the reviewer in a professional way offering her all her money back as well as a free hour of massages for her and her friend, nothing has happened and it's gotten me really upset. Does anyone know what to do in this situation? Any suggestions?

I'd love to start a discussion on the subject. I wrote about this today but I'll just give 4 quick bullet points to get it started

1. Have a great product or service
The easiest thing in the world to market is something that people really want.
If people don’t want what you are creating, no amount of clever marketing or selling is going to achieve long-term success.

2. Know your customer
Many small businesses go with the spray and pray method of sending out messages in all different directions and hoping for the best.
The questions you have to ask yourself are 1. What problem are you solving? And 2. Who needs this problem solved? When you can identify your exact ideal customer, you need to direct your marketing efforts to the places that person is. Anything else is just a waste of your valuable time.

3. Small Victories
We live in such an age of instant gratification, that we want to create something, and then immediately reach our long term goals.
Life doesn’t work that way. The best way to market on a budget is to go directly to people and sell them your product or service. Can you make one sale today? And then another tomorrow? Have a small victory each day, and in time, you’ll be headed toward those goals.

4. Relationships
Challenge yourself to meet people, not for what you can get out of it, but for what you can offer to them.
When you create relationships, opportunities multiply. For one, you learn from people when you actually listen. And as far as marketing on a budget, these relationship can lead to cross-promotional opportunities, partnerships or simply a valuable resource to keep in mind.

Would anyone actually buy this?,SouthernSam,26,6,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1gk8uf/a_stepbystep_guide_for_starting_a_hot_dog/,"I'm thought about making an online class. I haven't made it yet, but if people are interested then maybe I'll make it.

Background: When I was in college I wanted to start my own company with that was fun, outside, and didn't take a lot of money to start...so I did a hot dog stand.

Most hot dog stands are run by redneck old dudes but I was an arrogant 20 year old college kid...so I (unfortunately) didn't take a lot of their advice because I wanted it to be young and hip.

So I thought about putting something together a step-by-step course. Here's what it would contain:

1. How to register a business...who to call, where to go, and what to say
2. How to buy a cart
3. How to get certified by the health department
4. Step-by-step website set up
5. Registering for Square and taking credit card
6. Unique menu's that I used and tested
7. What starting supplies to buy and where to get them, including Amazon links
8. How to find a spot 
9. Email and phone templates for cold calling places when asking to set up on their property
10. Templates for fairs, concerts, and other places you wanna partner with
11. How to interact with customers, including scripts and drills for shy folks
12. Little tips like adjusting prices for lunch vs. drunk night hours
13. Other ""dirty secrets"" like using cheap ketchup on drunk people, how to get tips, and the golden product (bottle water)
14. How to pay taxes
15. How to cook
16. Twitter, Instagram, and other social media gimmicks to get you popular
17. Marketing tips, like setting up Yelp pages
18. How and when to buy merchandise 
18. How to be unique
19. Finally, a ton of funny stories I had including areas I failed in, so you can learn

About my business

Name: Southern Sam's
Was in business for 1 year. Some days made 50 bucks, some days made $800.
Hired 3 people...including the ""Bikini Weenie Girls""
Slogan was ""Wieners as big as a baby's arm""
Ran it while in college.


Anyway, I haven't made this yet but if people are willing to buy it then I will. I'm thinking I'd charge $50 bucks. You'd get videos, doc's, my cell number so you can ask questions via text, and maybe some other stuff.

If I get a good enough response here, then I'd most likely give it out for free or cheap so I can get feedback.

https://www.facebook.com/vanessa.hunt.526/posts/10103414475700144

It was posted less than 24 hours ago and already has more than 12,000 shares, and has resulted in the business's FB page being taken down after being flooded with hate posts, and dozens of negative Yelp reviews by people that have never heard of them other than this one post (by someone they don't even know, by this point).

Sure, the story in the original post is bad. The business owner deserves some negative word of mouth, some bad reviews by people that witnessed the event, etc. But being magnified this amount? It scares me as a small business owner myself. 

What could the owner of this place possibly do at this point to defend herself? Lets say she was having a particularly bad day, realized a couple hours later that she had acted very inappropriately, and called the mother in question to apologize to her. That wouldn't make a difference... it would just be lost under this instant tidal wave of negativity.

I have had about 3 years experience in the toy market selling a product many differrent places. Usually a distributor buys them and sells them wholesale to stores and websites. We have also sold many products through catalogs such as Hammacher Schlemmer. Every time we've done this, the company orders a set of them (100 or more) and then we get paid in 30 days. 

I just started my own company that sells wall-art. EVERY company I am dealing wants to do drop shipping. Every last one. The best opportunity we've had so far is a place called Touch Of Modern that at least fulfills the orders themselves. No one is ordering more than 3 at a time. With a new company, I appreciate the business, but it's a bitch to say ""yeah I'll drop ship"" when I have to make at least 6 pieces at a time. If they sell one piece, I'm left with 5 hanging around. Also, I don't understand why they still deserve 50% off retail when all they do is list items and provide me with an address. I feel like I should only be giving 30% or so.

This is a huge deal for us, because timeliness is extremely important in my business. I'm responsible for interacting with all our dealers and distributors and I was going to be in a shit storm until early September because I wasn't going to have product.

So we set out to get in touch with the owner of the whole factory (a really fucking important guy btw) that makes our stuff in Taiwan, to see if he could step in and get us our product sooner. This was our last hope. Keep in mind, this factory makes stuff for tons of companies, including huge ones like Honeywell and guys like that. We're small fish to these guys. This morning, we got this email back:

""Hello [My Boss's name]. I remember you because of the cowboy hat, which I like very much. I'll ship your product July 24.""

The cowboy hat in question is a gift my boss brought to the factory owner in 2010 when he visited the factory to discuss new products. It was a pretty nice hat, about $180. But realize that moving up the ship date of our product (over a month!) is literally going to save us hundreds of thousands of dollars. I know for sure a huge job that would have been cancelled (approx 80k) and I'm sure other ones would have popped up that we would not have been able to fufill. If my boss hadn't bought this factory owner this hat, who knows how long we'd be waiting and how much money we'd lose.

We're a family-owned company of about 15 people. We use Gmail (Google Apps free) . Our general-purpose email address is handled by Carl, which forwards emails to the appropriate person. When our employees don't want to divulge their internal email address (by the way, does this seem weird to you?), they reply to Carl and he responds to the original mail. Carl is not the problem.

**The problem is Jane**. She's family and responsible for Sales / Marketing / Finance. She will frequently leave an email unanswered for weeks. I've seen emails from people saying they're visiting the country in 3 weeks and would like to know when they could visit us, and she'll reply only when they're halfway through their stay.

It's not that Jane is lazy. She's not. She busts her balls working. But for some reason she won't reply to some emails straight away, and then takes forever to get to them. Many of these people are potential clients, I can't imagine them being well impressed. Maybe she doesn't have all the facts, but, wouldn't it be better to reply SOMETHING quickly and then follow up with a more complete response later? 

The manager sometimes browses through the general purpose email and wonders if some emails were handled promptly or are **stuck in Jane's unread limbo**. Some particularly important ones she'll ask about, but doesn't want to do this too often because it may upset Jane. My guess is she would get upset because she would have to answer ""not yet"" to most questions.

Has anyone else been in a similar position that would like to suggest ways of turning one-man shows into thriving companies?,JOSEPH_LEMIUS,22,4,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1kdgtg/my_startup_business_is_doing_much_better_than_i/,"Some background: 

I started an exporting company (based in the US) where my main customers are abroad and my vendors are US manufacturers. I started this business on my own and have been mainly using a combination of Word, Excel, and Quickbooks to create custom Invoices, Purchase Orders, Statements, and all other documentation. All orders I receive through my Outlook account or over the phone with close customers. 

The amount of work has been very manageable until about four months ago when my business suddenly picked up drastically as my email and phone orders increased nearly ten-fold. I had to work weekends as well as 70-80 hour weeks to keep up with just the paperwork and email responses and my marketing / customer service efforts were forced to be put on hold and this is becoming very detrimental to my company's reputation. 

I've realized that hiring employees is the obvious next step but I haven't the faintest idea of how to divide up the duties for this job. The main reasons that kept me from hiring employees in the first place is:

1) All my orders and customers speak a foreign language. I am bilingual so I have been able to handle all their requests and build relationships, but the ordering process always begins with their email / phone call so I was unable to pass this duty to an employee. 

Also, prices vary depending on our customer even though it's the same item so I was unable to just pass that duty on to an employee. 

2) I am very cautious of hiring a fellow bilingual employee because there is a very big risk in my line of work (as I've seen with fellow exporting companies) of employees learning the vendor names and customers and stealing the business whole. This is probably the main reason I've kept this essentially a one man business this whole time. 

Things I would love to implement into my business:
1. A team of employees that handle all Purchase Orders, Invoices, Statements, and Billing
2. A Customer service team that responds to all email questions and inquiries.

This would leave so much more time for me to focus on moving the company forward instead of just fielding orders and complaints. 

If anyone reading has been in a similar situation and would like to suggest any ideas for how to make that jump from being an individual business to a thriving company with a solid employee team, I would love to them.

Personally - I own an outdoor retailer. I would like more products- and companies that are quality to be hosted in my store - everything I find is from China or Alibaba - which in an economic sense is fine, but If I have to pay a little more for more oversight and quality - I want to - it's better for business.

I know the sub could be used as almost a glorified yellow pages- but we could set up some rules, and have some ""rule"" posts like they do for r/forhire. Something like these headings before a post:

[SB] for Small business
[OR] Online Retailer
[M] manufacturer

What else should be added?

And after the heading, the title should include either the service offered, or the request needed. So for example:

[OR] Looking for outdoor product manufacturer in the States. 

or

[M] I make ceramic mugs with custom silk-screening. Located Seattle, WA.


I'm also thinking that Small Businesses always need designers, and all that - how can we include them?

1328219173.0,17,self.smallbusiness,p8ad3,DIY SEO - Things you can do to improve your Search Engine Ranking!,JFMarketing,31,14,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/p8ad3/diy_seo_things_you_can_do_to_improve_your_search/,"Hi r/smallbusiness... I have some extra time today and figured I would give back to the community with a hopefully helpful guide to SEO.

**Local Search for offline business's:**

* Citations: The most important thing you can do for your offline business is to build citations. Citations are business listings such as yelp, yellowpages.com, and merchant circle. The more citations that you build, the more authority google gives your company. Here is a list of (mostly) free citations that you can submit your business to: http://searchengineland.com/top-50-citation-sources-for-uk-us-local-businesses-104938 
Consistency: Keep in mind when filling these out, that consistency is key. Extreme consistency between title of business, address, and phone number, as well as all other variables is extremely important. 

It can be a pain to fill these out, however, I highly suggest getting a google places, yelp, yellowpages, yahoo, bing, and merchant circle listing as soon as possible. These are the big ones.

**Organic Search:**
Title tags and Description tags: It amazes me how often companies will undervalue title tags and description tags. These are HUGE in ranking your website. Try it out, change your title tags to the keywords that you are trying to rank for and see how much you improve... you might be delightfully surprised :-). Also, try to have about 6% keyword density in the content of any page that you are trying to rank.

* **Keyword research:** While there are some really advanced keyword research tools out there that cost money, there are some really good free tools that you can use too: [The google keyword tool](https://adwords.google.com/o/Targeting/Explorer?__u=1000000000&amp;__c=1000000000&amp;ideaRequestType=KEYWORD_IDEAS#search.none) is great, and SEO book has a [free keyword tool](http://tools.seobook.com/keyword-tools/seobook/) as well if you create a free account with them. Do the research on popular keywords with low competition and profit!

* **LinkBuilding:** There is no easy way to do linkbuilding, and typically it will cost money, however, a couple easy ways to get links back to your website are writing articles on your topic and putting a link in them back to your site. You can submit these articles to sites like goarticles.com and ezinearticles.com. 


**EDIT** As **eightclicks** pointed out, submitting sites to article directories may not be the best use of your time. Sites like [Odesk](http://odesk.com), [fiverr](http://fiverr.com) and even r/freelance are good ways to get links built for relatively cheap.

Also, making guest posts on industry related blogs is another great way to get links to your site. The more links to your site, the more authority google gives your site. Keep in mind to make sure that you use the anchor text that you want to rank for. Example: [Carpet Cleaning](http://chemdry.com) helps that site rank better for the keyword carpet cleaning. Now don't go spamming reddit with your anchor text back to your site because many sites, like reddit, make it so that all links are no follow... which basically means that you don't get credit for the link.

Anyways, I'm just rambling and wrote this pretty quickly. I may have forgotten some things so please add to the discussion if I did, and all questions welcome!

They are too few and far between IMHO, but I just had one this weekend.

My business is seeking junior staff for out of school hour roles.  I decided to advertise this via our Facebook page. A classified ad costs about $140 to run for 2 days in our town, so I decided a promoted post budget of $100 was a fair comparison. I set up targeting to our town but not by age, simply because I wanted the parents to see the ad as well.  

At the start of the campaign we had just over 1050 likes, most of which are a relevant audience, i.e not bots or spam profiles (which is pretty respectable for our industry in a area of about 100,000).

As of now we have 1296 and rising.  The post itself has attracted over 60 comments and 90 'LIKES'. Best part is 3 days in I still have over $40 left of that $100 I budgeted! On the actual job application side I have received over 50 applications from people that are tech savy and already interested in our business not just 'looking for anything' which I consider a great result

A bonus is that all these new likes are relevant and targeted people who are in our business demographic.

1370648695.0,14,self.smallbusiness,1fwanf,How I made my commercial for free (here's my experience) - share your experience too.,TheCilician,17,3,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1fwanf/how_i_made_my_commercial_for_free_heres_my/,"I'll just get right into it.

You have a business that sells a product (Physical product), and you want to show off its features, or describe a function. With the advent of YouTube instructional videos giving businesses traffic and credibility, it was time I made my own. My business after all had to do with hiking boots/bootlaces, so I was getting a lot (I meant atleast 5 every three-four days) about how to tie a hiker's knot, or a different more rugged knot for a pair of my laces....

So I set out to make a commercial. Simple, easy, and light to watch (under 3 minutes). I after watching it, and seeing the process be more or less fun/ easy, I think I'll be making a couple more of these intructional commercials to add to my name, and help out my customers. 


Two of the things I used was. 

Camera - I used Nikon D700 with a 18-200mm lense. I borrowed this from my friend (it's become a pretty common camera after BestBuy started shelling them out for around $800). It's got fantastic video quality, and picks up sounds without the need of a mic. 

Tripod - The person you're borrowing from, or renting from should have a tripod, but if not, you can buy one for $50 off of craigslist. If you want to make more than one commercial, invest in a tripod. If you're not operating the camera, the person who is can be trusted to stabilize the camera more. And, in the event it's just you recording, you can set the camera at any height/angle to capture the instructional video shot. 


For the space, I used my workshop, but after hours so there wasn't any excess noise.

Basically I uploaded the video to YouTube, and used their editting software to splice in transition slides, a title slide, and a end credit slide. All this can be done in YouTube's video editing software (which you don't have to Download, or pay for. It's free with an account)

You're limited on the amount of scenes you can cut to, so this is for basic effects and adding text, which is still good if your video comes out clean in one take. I was fortunate enough not to forget my lines and did it all in one take.

If you're interested in a different approach, there is the animation commercial, which companies like: http://goanimate.com/    and   http://www.spotmixer.com/create_video/public_home do for a fee ofcourse.

It's a bit early for me to see the benefit of my commercial, but I think it's a fun and different way to interact with your customer/ audience base. 

If you've made a commercial for your business, please post it on here with some of the equipment you've used. I'd love to learn more about it, as i'm sure more small business owners would like to know more as well.

What would you do?,expandor,20,2,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1dikh1/was_about_to_open_a_second_location_but_my_right/,"I own a really busy stationary food truck that has been open for just over three years. I was going to open my second location this month but my right hand guy of two years quit after finding a job at a local brewery that he loves. 

I was going to let him run the already open one with a salary plus commission. I have three other employees but they don't show the motivation or dedication, or trustworthiness, that I'd look for in a manager. 

I have a few options but can't decide on which is the best.

1. Wait to open #2. I'd hate to do this because we're pretty dead in the winter. I'd like to make as much as I can now. This would let me find someone better suited to run it and train them appropriately. I'll probably train the other employees on certain aspects of managing it as well incase the same thing happens. I'd prefer to train an existing employee, as I don't know how easily I'd trust someone if I just hired someone to run it. 

2. There's a lot across the street from my current truck that the owner will rent to me. I could start up another truck with different foods and different hours. The current truck is a breakfast truck (8a-2p). The new truck could be a lunch and dinner truck. Being so close, I'd be able to hopefully run them both. With this I would be able to start making money pretty quick versus sitting on the investment of the second truck.

3. I own a few other trucks that I rent out. I do a rent to own deal with the ""tenants"" and they usually end up buying it. I could rent this one out. This would suck because I outfit my own trucks and really don't feel like building any more. And the income would be limited with no potential for earning more. 

Those are the only three that I could think of. What would you guys do?

I wanted to post what will probably be the final update.  I managed to take control! I sort of lucked out in that my former business partner has had nothing but bad luck since i made the decision to take over.

In a nutshell, the lawyer i was getting help from helped me draft a letter informing him of the 20k i've invested in the business and that since all of our LLC paperwork states we're 50/50 partners, he would have to pay me roughly $9000 + all the time and court fees if i was to sue him. I offered a really small sum of money to buyout his share along with this letter.  He pretty much rolled right over. So now my lawyer is going to have him come in and sign everything and give him his pay off.  This lawyer was pretty great and I was expecting some form of bill for the help but he told me he likes small business guys like me and that a 6 pack would suffice. 

My wife who is a saint got on the phone with all the tax and revenue people and managed to explain the situation and get everything remedied so there was no fines or liens against me. We got extensions and have most of our paperwork up to date at this point.

We've been open every weekend for the past month and slowly but surely we're building up a customer base. Once all this paperwork is sorted, we'll be back on track to get our labels approved and will FINALLY get our beer in stores!  

Just wanted to circle back and say thanks again for the help and support from this sub. it was major helpful.  if anyone is interested in following my brewery as we grow, definitely pop over to the [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/drinkhbf) and eventually drinkhbf.com if i ever find someone to help with making a site.

Of course the 5000 pound elephant in the room is that not many IT/Computer companies are going to be keen on me working for them while building a competitor out of my garage.

My web development consultancy has grown from 1 person 2 years ago to 7 people now. Things are rolling along quite nicely with some fun and profitable jobs coming up in the near future.

There's one issue that's become a real thorn in my side. I have a whole lot of legacy clients who I've had since the very early days who are starting to eat up serious amounts of my time.

 - They don't like speaking to my account service people, they always want to speak directly to me.
 - They are used to paying the hourly rate from 2 years ago, rather than what I charge my newer clients
 - They get everything at a lower rate, but kick up a big stink when something doesn't work quite right.
 - They are all very small businesses without much potential for growth, unlike the new clients I'm getting

Questionable credit, few assets.",DFdubya,18,3,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/18u0x9/sub_10k_startup_loan_questionable_credit_few/,"I believe I have done the due diligence searching on reddit for answers to my questions.  If this has been answered or I am placing it in an incorrect sub, please let me know and I'll remove it.

I come from a service industry work history. (bartending)  I have little experience in entrepreneurship, and am most certainly in need of some layman's resources.  As I stand, however, the following reigns as my most pertinent concern. 

I'll try to succinctly include all relevant details of my circumstances:

I recently married and decided to find a more suitable career for my lifestyle.  After consideration, I'm now nearing the end of my training in home inspection. I have a considerable network in place for an initial inflow of clients.  

In order to startup my company, I need:
A work truck (6-7k$)
Roughly 2500$ in tools
Roughly 1500$ in administrative materials. (tablet computer, printer, letterhead, etc)

I have about 20k in student loan debt from an uncompleted degree. My credit is poor, 650 at best.  My wife was more around 775, but purchased a home in the months before we were married. I am currently unemployed after relocating to the DFW area.

A personal loan is out of the question, because I have no income.  I feel that a small biz loan is unlikely, because I have debt and less than good credit.

Considering my circumstances, would it be wise to use personal credit cards in my wife's name for all purchases?  We have a few offers for interests free cards, and currently have about $25,000 in available credit on our current interest charging cards.

As a near worst case scenario, I would gross about 3k per month and it would take 2 years to pay off the initial 10,000$.  A modest, but optimistic projection would be total recouping within a year.  As a best case scenario, I would be able to recover the investment within 6 months.

Family might be an option, as my in-laws are in a position to lend that sort of sum.  My wife would prefer booked debt over owing family, however, and I tend to agree.

I guess I'm looking for advice, not a yes or no answer.  Should I take the time to create a business plan and present it to a bank, given my credit problems?

Is it not wiser to finance the entire endeavor on a $10,000 no-interest-for-15-months type of credit card, anyway? (Even though it will be in my wife's name?)

I'm happy to review any resources that you all feel might improve my understanding of the situation, I'm just not finding that much help in my own searching.

I haven't asked her about it yet but I was wondering if anyone had any thoughts on this situation. I'm guessing if she's paying them out of the till, her sales are being under reported by a similar amount? I'm lining up a CPA right now to assess things, but thought I would ask in here as well.

I decided that in order to avoid security issues and the inconvenience of forcing them to call me on the phone to provide the CC details that I would try Google checkout's email invoice. Boy was that a mistake. Here's the story. Has anyone found this thing to be reliable? I can't believe they would survive long with the features I (don't) see.

1) On setup Google notifies me they will be holding payments for a while to make sure I'm on the up and up. Annoying but perhaps necessary I suppose. They have my bank details though and it's not like I haven't spent a freaking fortune on Adwords in the same account. 

2) Customer enters payment and checks out from link in email invoice. No notification is sent to me. No verification is sent to the customer. Nothing is sent anywhere.

3) I look into this when I get an irate email about not getting their product and/or a receipt. I figure they didn't hit enter or something (despite claiming they did).

Problems? 

- Google has apparently reset Checkout to be part of Google Wallet and entirely buyer oriented. Most of the links on each checkout page will redirect you to the consumer side and kick you out of your merchant account forcing you to log in. Looking for information you can't easily find? Don't click in the wrong place or it's back to logging in again.

- A forum full of people posting things like 'is anyone there' and 'I have serious issues with my account, where is your phone number?' all with no response.

- An email inquiry system which lets you send only preformatted click button select type inquiries. Don't have the transaction number because you didn't do a web transaction, you did an email invoice? Too bad for you, there's no field for that. Want an email address? Too bad, that's last century. Presumably they use telepathy now.

Given my experience I could not possibly recommend Google checkout for any email invoice transaction. For web stores they may work fine (up until you have some issue) but for my needs they are a disaster.

Some of the first questions that came to my mind were about the distributor (which one too choose), how to promote ones website and the return process or if their are any tax-conditions one has to take care of.

While having been fairly successful in a small period of time, I have now been offered a position by a larger company who intends on taking over my region and wants me to head it up. I need advise.",pChristian70,18,3,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1hvou3/was_recently_laid_off_and_decided_to_go_it_on_my/,"I was the service manager for a small residential fitness equipment company for about three years and was laid off. There was theft, lying and stealing which I did not partake in, nor was I privy to to it. After the owner cleaned house, he decided to run background checks on everyone on in the company (something that was never done). My record, while the furthest thing from stellar, is behind me. I am married  now with two children and it has been over 4 years since I have had any brushes with the law and have kicked the drug habit that lead me to get into those situations.

All this, including what he knows of my work ethic and dependability over three years of a working relationship was not enough to sway him out of his paranoid mindset. Its his company, he had to do what he thought was best and that involved letting me go. I was pissed and raging but I knew better than to burn bridges. I thanked him for the opportunity to learn and grow under him and that I would like to have him as a reference for future endeavors. 

It was at this point that I made the decision to go into business for myself. I had the mindset that I would no longer allow someone to dictate what my financial future would be. Supporting my family is my responsibility and I will not work for anyone who could jeopardize that.

I started my own company providing residential warranty support for major fitness equipment manufactures as well as seeking out preventative maintenance contracts with Property management companies, hotels, health clubs and HOA's. Business has been a bit slow but steady. Thanks to a voucher from my former CEO I have been able to move up the list as the go to tech in my area for a couple of the larger companies and have been adding to that list weekly. Its coming around. The money is starting to come in and I feel like this is something that can work.

In comes the offer from a big company who pretty much runs the other side of the state and is looking to expand to this coast. They now me from my work with the other company and I ran into them as I was scheduling for a training session with a major manufacturer who happens to use their facility as a training location. 

They offered me a small but reasonable base salary which included, health, dental, a vehicle w/ gas card. And a standard commission plan which included a monthly draw to help off set my start up costs from starting my business. 

If I take it I feel like a coward for giving up what I am doing at the notion of steady cash with the opportunity to still operate as an entrepreneur and to go out and find more work to continue to grow the business. Its a good group of guys, a company if moving in the right direction and they have relationships with the right people in the industry. I would have had no problem signing up with them one month ago, but I have already been able to taste the fruits of self employment and am hesitant to relinquish it. I have a family to think of and I am the sole provider for them.

Has anyone ever been in a similar situation?

Thanks Guys

EDIT: I need *ADVICE*
-This guys illiterate, better take the job, he can't even spell!! 

EDIT: They shot down the notion of me subbing for them. Service head felt it wasn't in his best interest to pay to get me trained and certified on equipment that they have the luxury of being the only ones in the area to have certs on or the ability to certify on. The salary was increased 20% with stipends for home internet and mobile phone use as well as a 12 month employment contract and there is no non-compete clause involved in this.  

In the end I took the offer. I feel like a coward for not giving this a shot but I need the insurance and so do my kids. I have the ability to earn extra money through commissions and incentives and I will be able to save up and plan my next venture more thoroughly, as opposed to whipping a business out of thin in air in one week.

Little more story though....

**Question 1:**

What software do you use to track your business finances?

I'm about to (or think I am) become in charge of the finances of the small business I work for.  This job will include the following:

* Keeping track of all expenses

* Keeping track of all income

* Doing all invoicing to clients

* Goes along with expenses but keeping track of consultants pay 

I would like to be able to look at these numbers on a general basis and a job by job basis if the software allows me to.

Currently the numbers are kept on multiple excel spread sheets which I know you guys will scold me for, but hey, I don't handle it currently.

I have heard that Quicken is a good solution for this type of thing but I just wanted to see what everyone used and if there were other recommendations or any pitfalls of Quicken that people have seen.

**Question 2:**

Do you hire someone to go over your books with you and is it a necessity?

Do you do this just for taxes at the end of the year or do you do it throughout the year with an accountant or someone?

Do you think that the costs of this person pays for itself by savings, or just pays for itself because it limits mistakes, gives you advice, and allows you to focus on what you do for a living?

Any other thoughts, ideas, suggestions, would be great as well.

Thanks!

$30K / yr for a sales person 

$30K / yr for an office person (Im starting to have trouble tracking all sorts of things, a secretary would be awesome)

$30K for me (programmer)

Id have to get an actual office (my home office wouldnt suffice) so rent + utilities (add $12,000)

Then add in insurance (I know very little about that), legal, transportation,  (?) and just everything on top of that...

So it seems from my back of the napkin math and research I would need about $120K / yr in income to satisfy all the needs here and just break even. Currently Im working 65ish hours a week making just under $40K before taxes. 

So I have to make $120 a year and Im nearly completely tapped at $40K. I dont see any way to get any bigger than I am now, and feel I have to run on this treadmill set to kill just to stay in the same place. God forbid I get sick or something lol.

* Track issues at their estate (if a pipe is broken, or theres a leak, tenants can ""sign on"" to the issue and spark a discussion forum about said issue, tenants would have X amount of issues per month as to avoid abuse, extra issues would cost say, 25c/issue which goes to the landlord, or once max # of issues is used, they have the option of calling. Landlord can grant extra issues if the tenant already used theirs up legitimately (as in not raising issues for pointless shit)).

* Automatically pay rent via your credit card or whatever other service.

I go to a medium size school in a second tier city in the US. 6000 undergrads, 2500 grad students.

There are 3 grocery stores nearby, 2 whole foods and another local grocer in a similar vein/pricing to whole foods. All are approximately 20 minutes away by walking or bus.  There are a few campus stores, but they are very overpriced.  There's also a CVS and a local convenience store - not a large selection and again fairly expensive.

I am trying to determine how profitable this venture would/could be. To that end, I need to get a peg on operating costs and realistic revenues. Right now I'm using national averages ($9/sf/wk for sales and ~30% gross margin), but I'm having a bit of difficulty estimating operating costs.

The other issue is where the store is going to go. There's an open building (2400sq ft) on the busy retail street that is located next to campus. It used to be a convenience store from a local chain (I have the contact info of the previous tenant). It's about a 5 minute walk from the dorms.

I think it's the ideal location, but the rent is quite high (they're asking 50-60/sf triple net so 120000 to 140000/year + expenses).

I'm supposed to be talking to a regional grocery distribution coop next week and plan to reach out to the local farming community which is fairly active here.

Thoughts? Questions? Things I should be considering? Advice? What should I be doing?

**WARNING WALL OF TEXT IMMINENT** 

I was hired on as a Junior Electronics Technician for a small Tech business this week. My goal was to gain some experience with repairing small electronics, in this case phones and digital alarm systems, by learning under an experienced employee who needed help with product refurbishing. 

The boss man has made it clear that I will be doing most of my learning through him and he's incredibly nice and patient and so far the atmosphere at this small business is awesome with the exception of one thing. The warehouse and it's single employee is terribly organized.
Pallets of shipments that haven't been broken down and organized, labeled or logged in a separate inventory from the purchasing orders. 

Product boxes from new pallets are open with items laying around the ground from shipments a week old, while boxes from months ago sit in a corner. There's no structure to this warehouse. I tried to get a feel for the system they had going there but the warehouse worker made it clear that it was all best guess, he uses his memory to locate product, and doesn't do a very good job of it.

In the mean time, management seems to be on to his shenanigans because they're making him fill out an hourly work log sheet to keep track of his work load. He seems to like sitting on the computer and when I enter the warehouse, he kind of just wanders around and finds a place to fiddle with his iPod and phone. 

In the 4 days i've been there I presented some ideas to the staff and manger and they seem to like where I am going with it but it really does seem like a painstaking task at hand, I know i'm not going to get much help from the warehouse worker and I don't want to report any issue because he does have more insight into how things work there vs me and my days of experience, not to mention he does do the work on refurbed machines, it just takes him 2 weeks to ship them out according to the manager. 

This warehouse is 50x40 ft. in workable space. With no shelving available for product, only a few small shelves for packing materials and miscellaneous product documentation and office equipment. Every item can be broken down into about 6 or 7 different categories and inventory varies from category, from as high as 3400 pieces to as low as 18. In total they probably have 26k pieces of inventory currently available and I think maybe...60-75% of their floor space is occupied. I don't have exact dimensions on boxes because it varies from product but I don't believe anyting can be stacked higher than 6-8 boxes without it becoming out of reach from us at floor level. 

I really need some idea on how I should tackle this...I've been doing research on inventory management but i'm a little overwhelmed.

Extra information.

I'm working here part time, 20 hours a week.
I'm working another job doing computer repair 20 hours a week.

TL;DR: Got hired to fix electronics, Put in charge of warehouse, No organizational system whatsoever, I want to fix this issue and become employee of the year.

Our real website goes live soon and I think we will really be struggling unless I can streamline things a bit. I'll detail our usual format below and would appreciate any advice anyone has to offer:

1. Print invoices for the previous days sales

2. Either give the stack of invoices to a staff member to pick and pack, or produce a crude picklist on excel

3. Attach the invoices to the outside of the packets and weigh each packet individually. They then write the weight of each parcel on the outside.

4. Start producing postage labels manually by entering address details and weights into the despatch software and attaching them to the applicable parcel. (Sometimes I use a CSV file but all this does is allow me to print all labels at once)

How would you go about streamlining this process? My main concern is that the only way to tell what's in a parcel when it is labelled is by the attached invoice on the outside. I've been thinking about using some sort of reference system, is this what the big players do?

Original post: http://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1ehtd5/my_accountant_charged_me_1250_for_my_year_end/

 I visited my accountant Saturday. I sat down at her desk and basically said that I needed to know exactly what I'm paying for. I told her to start with the personal return and explain like I'm 5. She started with ""Well next year yours will only be $125 because you'll just have a K1 and a W2. I asked what else I had this year that warranted the extra $300. She mumbled around a bit and tried to change the subject but I became stern and said ""Please, show me which extra form or forms that I am being charged $300 for"". She once again dodged the question.

I moved on to the $825 corporate return and she said that it was because it was my first year in business and things needed to be filed with the state. I told her I had two objections. 1)My friend Brian started a new business at the same time I did, and she charged him $350, and 2)the other accountant should have already had all of those things with the state completed. Finally I told her that all my calls are recorded and stored with nextiva (which is true, but I talk to her on my cell phone which is not recorded) and that I was going to check because I was pretty sure she told me $350 for the corporate return.

She became very pale and suddenly decided ""You know what? I think 
I'll just lower everything to $500"".

I've decided she was upset that I told her I was going to do my own bookkeeping and wanted to get money out of me.


The lesson learned here is that I have to start getting everything in writing. I had too much trust in this person and she was just trying to make some extra money off me.

So i've taken control of everything from our twitter account to our original gmail account we were using before we got our domain.  the only thing i wasn't able to recover and take ownership of was our domain which is kind of shitty but enabled me to use the domain name i wanted originally so that's cool.  i've contacted all of our vendors and informed them of the situation and we're good there.  one exceptionally shitty thing that has happened however is we've come to learn that he hasn't filled out of done any of our taxes since we opened.  it was a matter of chance that my wife called to see the status of everything and we came to learn that we were 3 days away from losing our liquor license and having a 75k lien against the brewery.  we've gotten extensions and are fixing it but it looks like my partner basically did some paperwork to get us legal and that was it. so he's completely neglected to fulfill his job duties which is good for us.

Her car continually breaks down, she has asthma and so has had to come in late/leave early on several occasions, her house got broken into the other week and because she has young children (single mom), she often has to call in sick if one of them gets sick. I can sympathize, but on the other hand I simply can't afford to keep an employee who is this inconsistent about her attendance. 

Since my business employs under 20 people and I am in Tennessee, which is an at-will employment state, I can fire her at my discretion at any time. However, I have a feeling she's going to file for unemployment if I fire her and even though she won't win her claim (I've gone through this several times with previous employees), it's a huge hassle to have to go down to court and spend several hours there to resolve the matter.

(LLC's, S-corps, C-corps, partnerships, etc.)",pawn_guy,15,0,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/uuyzp/psa_regarding_business_designations_llcs_scorps/,"I see a lot of posts asking about what type of designation someone should use when forming their business, and it seems that many people, including those giving advice, are somewhat unknowledgeable in regards to state and federal level business and tax classifications.

An LLC (limited liability company) is a state level designation. As of 1997, every state in the US allows both single member and multi-member LLC's. Other LLC requirements and details depend on the state in which you form the LLC. There are other state level designations, which vary from state to state, including different kinds of corporations (close corporation, foreign corporation, professional corporation, etc), limited partnership, limited liability limited partnership, sole proprietorship, and general proprietorship. You can go here to select your state and see what state level designations are available and how they work: http://www.sba.gov/content/incorporating-your-business

Side note (not sure if this applies to all states): Sole proprietorships and general partnerships do not need to file forms with their state unless doing business under a different name than their own ""true name"". Then you must file with the state as a fictitious name registration, known to most people as a DBA (doing business as).

You'll notice that C corporation and S corporation were not listed above as a state designation. That is because these are federal level tax classifications. Anyone forming an LLC must then classify their business as a sole proprietorship, partnership, S corporation, or C corporation for federal tax purposes. (Note: a single member LLC can not be a partnership, and a multi-member LLC can not be a sole proprietorship)

All of these federal classifications except for C corporation, have pass-through taxation, meaning that profits are not ""double taxed"", and instead show directly on the member(s) personal taxes. One of the differences between an S corporation and a partnership is that with an S corporation there is no flexibility in how profits and losses are split between the members.

Most small businesses and start-ups are best off forming an LLC and then classifying as a sole proprietorship or partnerships (depending on number of members) for federal taxes. This allows the member(s) more protection from debts and other liabilities that the business may incur, but also allows easy pass-through taxation and the flexibility that most new businesses want. Most of the benefits of an S corporation only affect larger and more profitable businesses, and you'll always have the option to switch to being an LLC classified as an S corporation later on.

I also have to say I've been struggling to find a job and I think it might be the time to start a business. I live with my parents, they have everything I need to make lasagna, and making lasagna is cheap. (And I can make a good lasgna.)

I started my business Oct 1 and she is charging me $425 for my personal taxes (I had one 1099 for around $32,000) and $825 for my corporate taxes. 

My parents and a family friend use her and she only charges them $350 for year end work and $100 for personal taxes. 

I think she is butt-hurt because I told her I couldn't pay her $135 per month any longer to do my bookkeeping when I average less than one transaction per day.

Edit: I visited my accountant Saturday. I sat down at her desk and basically said that I needed to know exactly what I'm paying for. I told her to start with the personal return and explain like I'm 5. She started with ""Well next year yours will only be $125 because you'll just have a K1 and a W2. I asked what else I had this year that warranted the extra $300. She mumbled around a bit and tried to change the subject but I became stern and said ""Please, show me which extra form or forms that I am being charged $300 for"". She once again dodged the question.

I moved on to the $825 corporate return and she said that it was because it was my first year in business and things needed to be filed with the state. I told her I had two objections. 1)My friend Brian started a new business at the same time I did, and she charged him $350, and 2)the other accountant should have already had all of those things with the state completed. Finally I told her that all my calls are recorded and stored with nextiva (which is true, but I talk to her on my cell phone which is not recorded) and that I was going to check because I was pretty sure she told me $350 for the corporate return.

She became very pale and suddenly decided ""You know what? I think I'll just lower everything to $500"".

I honestly hate sales, and in my industry (Internet Marketing) it is field with snake oil salesmen and shady people.

Anyone have any suggestions as to how to approach potential clients without coming off as a used car salesmen personality? Do ""cold calls"" with emails actually work? I always laugh at them when I get them because I know its all template but to those not in the industry actually go for it? Should I start using some of those shady tactics just because they do work but be honest and keep the clients best interests in mind when actually working with them?

1.) How much collateral will the bank expect from me, personally?

2.) Can I use the inventory the business will be purchasing as collateral towards the loan?

3.) What should I expect from my credit score?

4.) Does anyone know of any programs that could potentially help my startup financially?

Having said all that I feel like I have zero time to focus on growth.  As the owner I'm always working.  We have two employees who are good, but I still end up doing a fair amount of field work.  Between management tasks, proposals, and revenue generating work, I have no time to focus on growth strategies.  At this stage it isn't feasible to hire a third person, and truthfully the type of person I'd want to hire (a replacement for me) would be WAY out of our budget.  I also feel that any new technology we use (we use a lot of automation) always has to be learned by me before being adopted by the employees.

How do I get over this hurdle of overworking and under-focusing on growth?

I haven't even picked a location yet, and where we pick a location affects other things, we are definitely actively looking but how much credit we can get affects the choice of place...

What kind of bank do I choose? I was thinking BBT...

I am trying to get this same product to our operations in the second market.  But my competitor in my original market has told this supplier that if they sell to me in a different market, he will stop buying from them.

I am at a loss about what to do.  I have people/accounts waiting for this supplier to ship to me in the new market so I can distribute but they will not because of the original market's competitor's demand.

This competitor has been in the business for 30+ years.  I am on year 2.  Obviously he has the experience and the clout to make this happen.

Advice please!",fadingfastsd,13,3,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1ac9s3/2_years_full_time_into_a_motorcycle_parts/,"Hi /r/smallbusiness. I've been a subscriber here, daily browsing this subreddit, along with /r/entrepreneur and other business related subs. I've read many interesting posts here and seen much helpful information offered by members. I am going to try and give back by relating my advice and experience in the near future, but right now I've got alot on my mind and could really use some advice and opinions from a new point of view.

Now for some background to begin with. I'm 30, and a degreed Electrical Engineer by education. I worked for 3+ years out of college as an EE for a company making very high tech semiconductor test equipment. While the money was great, it was not my passion. My hobby was always motorcycles (riding, customizing, building, restoring, etc), and I wanted a way to combine my education and enjoyment/interest in electronics with my passion. After pushing hard for a job at a motorcycle electrical component manufacturer for almost a year, I was hired to run their R&amp;D department. This consisted of designing motorcycle charging system components, and then arranging and  overseeing overseas manufacturing in China/Taiwan/India, as well as quality control.  Despite a paycut, I was still making good money and getting paid to play with motorcycles &amp; come up with new ideas.  Fast-forward a year at this company, and it turned out the owner was very dishonest and many bad things were happening behind the scenes. After 1 year of employment I was laid off with no warning.  This was in early 2010...a very bad time to be looking for a new job.  After spending the remainder of 2010 applying for literally hundreds of engineering and computer/technical jobs with exactly 1 interview (never heard back), I was very discouraged.  Still having many contacts in the motorcycle electronics manufacturing area, myself and  a coworker from the previous company decided to start a new business.

We began our business in February 2011.  I'm not mentioning the name of the business now, although I may later in discussion. My partner has another a small business and overall a steady income. He does not rely on our business for income. For the first year of business, I had various income between part time computer work for a friends business, and various independent consulting work (motorcycle wiring harness design jobs, usually documenting the wiring for existing products for some other small businesses).  I have taken very little money from this business (less than $3,000 in 2 years), and for the last 8 months, absolutely nothing. I work full time, well over 8 hours per day on this business, and I have slowly been bleeding savings dry. At this point I have less than 2 months of bills left in the bank. This financial situation is very stressful. As I will get to below, I can't strangle the business by pulling money from it.

Being an Engineer by training and education, I knew very little about running a business.  I have learned a great deal. My partner handles the accounting and books, as well as online marketplace sales channels and importation. I handle product design, overseas production, website sales, and technical support.  We design our parts here in USA, prototype them, and test them to iron out new designs. We then have the parts built in large quantity overseas and import them. We warehouse and retail them ourselves.  The margin is very good and high on our parts.

We achieved about $50k in sales our first year, and about $60k in sales our second year. Sales channels are via eBay/Amazon (online marketplace), website, phone orders from customers, and our dealers (dealers get a discount on parts to sell to their customers...40% off retail which is the best margin in the business).  

I'm trying not to ramble too much here, but I have many thoughts and ideas floating around in my head. The main issue being that I have a full time job with no income. I know that it is highly recommended to have a couple years of income saved before starting a business. Unfortunately being in a position where I was unable to find a job despite my best efforts, I jumped into this in order to be putting all of my effort into something worthwhile.  I really couldn't take another month let alone a year of applying for jobs with no response.

Our business requires a great deal of cash flow. While our parts are very cheap per item to manufacture, we have to build in large quantities to be cost effective, and for the price of shipping via ocean freight to be efficient.  If we take money out of the business as we have it available, we will not be able to afford our next production run in a couple months. It requires always planning and juggling money for new production.

I feel like overall I just can't get ahead. We are always afloat, always making enough to pay the business expenses and be self sufficient. However, if I can't support myself, how can I keep this up? I can't bear the thought of walking away from something I've put my heart, soul, and life into for the last 2 years. The business is solid, there is not a huge amount of competition, and it is something I am very good at. However, I just can't seem to grow it large enough to support me financially. It gets very discouraging to work so hard yet be so broke.  While overall, we're probably at a very reasonable and respectable place for 2 years into a new business, without being able to be financially secure, I am very stressed.  Going from making $70k+ with no financial worries 3 years ago, to being broke and struggling for the last 2 years has worn me down to an unhappy and unhealthy person.  However, walking away doesn't seem to be an option to me, as I have taken 2 loans from family to grow the business (totaling $25k) and I cannot rest until they are paid back in full with interest (agreed upon payment at very low %, simple interest. Very helpful and supportive family).

To sum up this rambling mess, I guess I'm looking for some advice or understanding from people who've been in my situation. After extremely hard work I just can't seem to get ahead. No matter what I try, what I do, I can't seem to increase retail sales enough to get us to the next level. We don't currently stock a wide enough range of parts for larger distributors to pick us up (which would result in large orders, which we need), forcing us to focus on retail sales ourself, which are costly (advertising) and time consuming.  I have this nagging feeling that I am always missing something, just out of my site or grasp, that is extremely obvious and would result in the growth we need to turn the corner.  I currently have in stock a retail price of inventory worth over $100k, yet can't come up with a way to move it faster and in higher quantity.  I'm very quickly going completely broke and will be unable to support myself.  I have started to look for a job that I can work to pay my bills while I continue the business, yet I don't know how I will manage that as I currently work full time.

Throwaway account here due to the nature of the subject.

I represent a private investor group which is interested in buying one or more online businesses in the very short term (next few weeks). We have already closed on varied businesses from e-commerce to ad revenue based sites to forums to SAAS.

I am not a broker (IANAB? ... at least it's better than that lawyer acronym), nor affiliated with one - just representing a group and in charge of managing acquisitions. Opinions expressed here are solely my own. Neither I nor the group  will disclose your information to third parties - that's just bad form / karma.

Running this question past the subreddit mods before posting, they had a few good suggestions (thanks David). The first suggestion was sharing a bit about what makes a business attractive for buyout or investment. That's the subject of thousands of articles, but to distill a bit of what we find compelling in a few words:

#1. A Good Story.
#2. Good Data: a well-documented history of marketing, growth, and earnings.

The first item sounds obvious, right? Frequently though, business owners do not communicate with a clear voice: motivation for building the business, how they improved the business over time, challenges along the way, motivation for selling.

As for #2, nothing makes everyone's^* lives easier than clean records. Google, while by no means the end-all be-all of online business services, has offered some convenient tools over the years to measure and share business data. If you are the least bit hesitant about sharing your information with third parties (worried about unscrupulous keyword miners, for instance), get an NDA signed up front.

Often, we find it is helpful when companies use Google Analytics from the beginning - when needed, businesses can invite potential buyers to look directly at traffic history, which supports their growth story. Be up front about traffic anomalies - there are dozens, if not hundreds of ways for potential buyers to sneak a peek at any Panda or Penguin penalties your site may have incurred, even without direct access to your analytics.

If a company uses AdWords, again, users can easily be invited to view campaign history and performance. Tread cautiously here, though. Competitors can gain powerful strategic knowledge about your marketing this way.

#On Earnings:
Some practical advice for those getting started: separate your business accounts from your personal from the beginning, or as soon as possible. This applies to everything from e-mails to logins to merchant accounts. Someday when you sell, you may be required to transfer accounts, and it can be difficult if not downright impossible to separate accounts them. Paypal can be especially thorny in this regard.

For those of you with multiple income sources, don't co-mingle income in the same account, or it may be very difficult to clearly document sources.

General advice on flipping services: There are a few sites that specializing in selling online properties (businesses, sites, and domains)like Flippa.com (formerly sitepoint.com). Flippa is the craigslist of online business selling - it can be a benefit, but there's plenty of dross to get through, both for buyers and sellers. In theory, they are trying to add legitimacy to an online marketplace with user ratings and feedback, and the semblance of safety. In practice, they accomplish none of this in a meaningful way. User accounts come and go, they use some minor bit of cookie / IP association that attempts to flag users running duplicate accounts, and their legal disclaimers tend to indemnify only themselves. There are some diamonds in the rough on both sides, but wading through the mess is time consuming.

Online business brokerages have been a mixed bag - they often charge sellers a hefty premium (10-15% or more of purchase price) for their services. Compare this against the 6% considered the national norm for selling a house, and it appears steep. Our experience is that we commit all the same resources for due diligence with or without a broker, so they are a high added expense to overcome when buying a business. YMMV. 

-------
#Returning back to our self-centered needs... What we are looking for:

Ideally, we are looking to buy positive cash-flowing online businesses at 2X average annual net (total owners benefit). Verifiable income and traffic sources required. Access to Google Analytics is preferred. We will sign NDAs as appropriate.

General questions, please post to the thread. All other inquiries, especially any personally identifying information, please PM.

So I assume this is a place to go for advice, if not, as in if there is a more appropriate subreddit, sorry about that. It was this or /r/startups and I went here instead.

So, onto the nitty gritty. Me and my friend have both talked multiple times about starting our own business (I'm 21 and he's 20) because we figure if there is ever a time to go into potential debt, when we're young is it. I am not very well-versed on how to go about this whole thing. Our idea is to open a self-service garage (Rental by hour or full day, tool rental, and air tool rental, and various common products for sale (oil, piping, etc)). There is a perfect location nearby us, and opportunity doesn't come knocking very often. Unfortunately, we are both students so it's probably going to be pretty hard to get a loan for a business, not to mention neither of us are business majors, just two dreamers with a passion for automobiles. 

My questions are as follows:

Loans, how to? I assume you have to present some sort of business model, mission statement, etc when you walk in there, but in this economy that doesn't seem so easy.

Do companies often sell their products at a discount for ""free"" advertising? Example being, Castrol supplying oil at a slight discount to get free advertising as the only oil available or Kobalt selling tools similarly?

Since this would be a parternship (at least from the start), what are good ways to prevent money from ruining a friendship?

Are we dreaming too big?

We addressed the problem of liabilities (people welding and using air tools is in and of itself dangerous) so how would we go about mitigating that? I offered the idea of a waiver, but does this have to be legally approved or can it just say something along the lines of ""you proceed at your own risk?"" Also, setting rules like adult supervision, present ID to confirm over 18 etc.

I'm 100% willing to go all-in for this idea. I have always wanted to work for myself because I don't do well working under people. 

Thanks for answering my questions.

What's your take on this situation?,iluvceviche,13,1,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/znyjg/having_some_difficulty_coming_to_an_agreement/,"We run a family business that's existed for over 20 years with customers throughout the country, including the region where we want to hire a sales rep.

We are not based in that region, but we do trade shows there and also have a website - our two venues for customers in that region to see our products.  The reason we are hiring a rep is because there are customers who do not come to the shows or do not use the internet.

The complication is that we are hiring him for a region where we already have clients, and where we have venues whereby clients can reach us and place orders.

So I offered that for any new clients he introduces, I will pay him commission on their orders regardless of who they order from; even if they later decide to order from us directly.

Of course, he's happy with this.

However, for our **existing** clients, I offered to pay commission for ONLY the orders that come through him, and not the ones that they order from us directly.  In other words, if they order from him but then orders from us the next time, I will not pay him commission for that last order.

He does not agree to this and wants commission on repeat orders.

What is the norm in this kind of situation and what is your opinion?

Edit:  I forgot to mention that he said he wanted a list of all our customers in that region.  Is this questionable?

Edit2:  We've decided not to hire him after all.  After speaking with him, it was clear he wanted commission on 100% of the clients in that region, regardless of how they order or whose client they are, even from the shows we go and work at.  And turns out the reason he wanted the list of customers was so he can go after them.

1340643027.0,11,self.smallbusiness,vkumq,Some thoughts from my experience,remarkless,18,7,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/vkumq/some_thoughts_from_my_experience/,"I'm currently watching the company I'm working for sinking to its death. Its a small business, started in 1999, that does wedding and event flowers and decor. The industry in a whole has taken a beating throughout this recession. No one wants to spend big bucks on weddings anymore. However, thats not the reason this business is dying. 

A few of my observations:

* Don't fight your employees. 

Your employees are there to help you. Yes, the boss' word is final. But sometimes you (the boss) is stupid. When an employee raises a red flag, don't fight it, take it into consideration.

&gt; Just recently I made up some photo books of our work to give to local venues that we have good relationships with. They're a good sales tool. Then mr. signs-the-checks walks in and insists certain pictures need to be included. Pictures that are scanned in from early 2000's pictures, nothing digital. I insisted, they'll look wretched and will detract from the sales tool aspect of these books. I did all I could to convince him against it, but finally he just played his ""I sign the paychecks"" bullshit. So now I have several photo books with horribly crappy images in them, which will certainly detract from the presentation overall.




* Trust your employees

My employer has major trust issues, I have no idea why, but its his downfall. If you can't trust an employee who has been working for you for over 8 years, you'll never have a wonderfully successful business. Have some faith in your employees, have some faith that they're not all out to screw you over. Dedicated employees will work hard for you. Manage them, but don't constantly micromanage. Give them freedom. Let them bring their ideas to the table. 




* Let go

You have two options. Work yourself to death and do everything yourself, or delegate tasks to employees and offer support and guidance. Do the things that you need to do, delegate what you can. You'll never grow as a business if you spend all your time doing menial tasks. Yes, you'll always have menial tasks to do, but delegate what you can and manage those that you do give them to.

&gt; My boss often walks in and screams something along the lines of ""WELL I CAN'T DO IT ALL!"" when something goes wrong. He's right, he can't do it all, but he insists that he should, because he won't delegate out tasks. If he had let someone else review the order or make the reservation, maybe they would have seen the conflict, but since he's constantly in over his head, he misses things like that. 



* Allow freedom of thoughts

You're not the only person who knows anything. Be open to suggestions from your employees. They're on the front line. They're in the trenches. They're getting to know your company and likely have good suggestions. Being open to suggestions doesn't mean you have to initiate them, but you certainly should think about them. Don't put up a wall, listen, understand and take them into consideration.

&gt; I came into this job with 100s of ideas to grow the company. Every single one was shot down. ""Too much work"" ""That will never work"" ""No."" Everything I suggested, from marketing ideas to business restructuring ideas, was a stupid suggestion. 


Those are just a few of my thoughts, this is my attempt to vent frustrations with a more positive outcome. Hopefully I don't come off as stupid and bitchy. 


My background: I'm an executive assistant by trade. I worked for a boutique management consulting firm for 2 years as an exec assistant and executive director. Then I got into this job, unfortunately. I've been stifled in this job since the day I began and all I've been doing is watch it sink like the titanic. I could have saved the company, but every attempt I made on my own only got me in trouble.

I was pleased there are others like me out there.

The short version: My son (22) and I are opening a powder coating business May 1. He did well in accounting in college, but I have years of experience in management, advertising, computers, powder coating...etc. Wish us luck.

The somewhat longer version: a year ago, the company I worked for went bankrupt because of poor management. I was their director of I.T. / I.S. / Advertising and Marketing. We were doing more than $18 million a year in sales, more than two million in gross profits, six branch offices in six states and kicking everyone's ass in the industry. We were the hot shit. But the GM weasel, who also played accountant, screwed the pooch and the owner, who 10 years ago was someone, had gone ""rich-stupid"" and the company failed. Twenty-eight people lost their jobs and I was one of them. 

Over the past year, I've been doing consulting. I've made a few dollars and kept from going on unemployment. I've pulled two businesses that were on the cusp, out of the fire and into the black again, did some freelance advertising and marketing, fixed a few computers and created a few websites. It's a not-too-steady stream of money, but we're not homeless and the bills all got paid. 

My son works as a QC in a factory. He hates it. I sympathize because I worked as the master carpenter and thermoplastics welder in a factory for three years and I hated it.

So we're going to open the only powder coating business in a county of about 54,000 people. There are 14 medium-sized manufacturing facilities and a boat load of smaller ones, a short track for auto racing (of which I know a driver very well and he said he'll throw business our way) and many ATV and boating enthusiasts. (In our state, you're never further than six miles from a lake or river...I don't know where I read this, but it seems right)

As well as powder coating, we'll also be doing sandblasting, glass etching and production grinding.

We found out the building we want is available and we're throwing 2/3rds of my retirement money into it. We know we can make it work with my son running the front office -- accounting, scheduling, invoicing, A/R, A/P, inventory tracking, etc..., his best friend and my ""son from another bun"" doing the sales, deliveries and foot work, my ex-wife's sister doing cold calls, follow ups and filing part time. I'll be doing the powder coating, website, advertising and sandblasting.

I'm tired of teaching other businesses how to be efficient and productive, I think it's high time, I work for myself, with my boy.

Wish us luck.

edit: We'll be using the Quickbooks 2011 Premier for accounting on a Proliant ML350 G6 quadcore with 16 gig ram, four 500g HDs (from my former employer), which will also host our website, the name of which is registered already. We will use a lot of social networking, which my son is better at than I am, advertising in the local newspaper, trade shows, mass e-mails twice per month to manufacturers and other prospective clients from an easy opt-out mailing list our sales person is already putting together. 

The company is a subsidiary of the parent company I created when I became a consultant and was set up with the help of my CPA, who will be doing the taxes and payroll for the company. We'll be using a DBA which is $10 at the courthouse. Our bank is a local one with a 5-star rating that I've been with for 30+ years and we're getting a $20,000 SBA-guaranteed loan at 4.8% rather than take the money from my IRA or putting my house or other assets at risk (The IRA is collateral) to improve the company's credit rating. My credit score is around 800, according to FICO.

The building is 4,250 square feet total with three offices, a kitchenette, the computer room, storage room and two bathrooms, plus the 3,000 square feet of 4"" reinforced concrete floor for the work area and is wired for 240 and 480v. 

Rent on the building is $1100/mo, plus utilities, and the cost for the equipment I need to get started is just under $10g. The rest of money will be in the account to cover payroll and start up expenses, like a signage out front, business cards, desks, file cabinets and display samples. When the company I worked for went belly up, I purchased 48 computers from the bank, including software licenses, printers, routers and video surveillance systems for $400 so our offices will be fine. (They were not I.T. people and had no idea how much I laughed inside when I negotiated the price with their representative) 

My skill set includes 10 years of I.T., networking, advertising and marketing, five years as a master carpenter and thermoplastics welder (where I first started powder coating), newspaper editor, combat engineer with the Army, education as a geek with New Horizon and the community college, theology and journalism degrees, management training, office manager somewhere in my past and I've written two books.

My parents have owned a deli and catering business for almost 7 years now. It's a nice mom &amp; pop shop, and everything is homemade, *except* the rice pudding and cole slaw. 

Their problem? They're barely making anything, because no one knows they're there, which is crazy! We have people who *live* in the neighborhood come in and ask how long we've been open. They're surprised when we say 6 1/2 years.

 The first 2 years were like they usually are when opening small business, kinda slow and just paying bills. The next three years were much better. Then, this past 1 1/2 years, they're *just* making enough for bills. It sucks, because being 19 and in college, I can't *always* be there, and they can't afford to hire any more employees. (currently only *three*, two college girls and one older woman)  My mother and father work *by themselves* on tuesdays and thursdays until I get home from school, then I help them close. They bust their asses off with barely anything to show for it, yet they have a great product. 

They sell close to 50 lbs of chicken salad a week. It was, at one point, up for Best of Philly in Philadelphia Magazine. 

Their catering end, which is the most profitable side, in terms of money being made for the amount of work, doesn't get much business. *Maybe* once a month they'll get a job. They don't have anything scheduled until December 3rd. They get rave reviews from their food. 

They don't advertise. And it hurts them. They have a great product, yet the only people that know about them are the regulars and the people that wait at the bus stop out front. 

I recently convinced them to let me use Intuit to begin making their website, www.foxchasedeli.com . I also just submitted an ad to Reddit's free ad for small business promotion. I designed and bought some business/courtesy cards for them, and just need to order a stamp for them. I plan on buying them 3 car door magnets for their cars.

I ask you, specifically any of you that are in the same business, or just know how to market a business, if there's any cheap yet effective ways to advertise or get their name out there.

Quickbooks works well for us for tracking inventory &amp; creating sales receipts but it would be nice to have something with a more stream-lined workflow when creating a sales receipt and also generates reports a little more useful for a retail operation.

I started out selling fun ones at conventions and through a local retail store I frequent, but that'll never pay the rent.  However, selling them to restaurants, dealerships, and other businesses will.  A friend of a friend of mine sells promotional items, but can only do buttons in large bulk (1000+); when he saw my buttons and found out I'm local, offer custom work, and have no minimum amount, he went nuts with happy, because he's often had to turn down work because the amounts were just too small.  (20, 50, 100.)

He got me a fantastic introduction to a local business who loved my ideas, my design work, and to our surprise, ordered 100 items on the spot.  He's given me a great glimpse into ways to pitch my buttons (beyond what I already had), and is going to set up a few more introductions for me, but I really need to be doing my own pavement pounding.

And I have no idea how.  

My biggest concern is I don't know the etiquette.  Should I always call or write first?  How should first contact be made?  Is just showing up okay?  How much follow up should I give to someone who was interested, or non-committal, or dubious?  What kind of waiting period should I have between contacts?  I'm already a socially awkward, socially anxious penguin, so starting this part terrifies me, but I need to do it.  

What's your best method?  And what's YOUR method for keeping track of this stuff?

In the future, if I can get this rolling, I want to hire someone else to do part-time sales for me, but for now, it's all me.

If anyone can recommend a good guide--on the protocols, the etiquette, tips, tricks, hints, whatever--I would be grateful.  (I have more information about what I want to pitch, how far I am with the business setup and/or retail sales right now, etc.)

And one final note: I do have customer service experience, quite a bit of it, but it's mostly been retail (captive audience) or customers coming to *me* (CS as part of a management type job).

In talking with most of the perspective owners of these new shops I've heard some outrageous prices as far as renting or leasing. We own the location we are in with 4 separate units and the monthly payment to the small business loan is usually way less than other peoples cost of the lease. 

I understand that property comes with taxes, utilities, and maintenance costs. Our payment on the entire property, building and land is considerably less than what someone is paying on a much smaller space. Is it reasonable to look at building something bigger and renting out the extra spaces to tenants rather than paying high rent to some one else?

I've registered my LLC, created my business plan, done my market research etc, found a perfect location with a landlord who is extremely helpful and willing to work with me (50% off rent the first 3 months), and I've spoken with someone about the renovations that need done (~$5000). Everything is going well.
The only thing I have left to do is deal with the local health department and find out what needs to be done to make the space acceptable for food service, find out what the price would be to update the plumbing to what I need it to be, and secure a loan from the bank.


As far as the loan goes, I have no savings/retirement to speak of as I'm fairly young. I also have no startup history for the same reasons. I own a car and a good credit score (~720), and that's about it. Ideally I'd like $50k to cover a couple months of operating expenses as well as anything else that might come up, but after trimming the budget I can get the business off the ground for $35k. **As someone with no collateral what do I need to do in order to get a loan?** I have a parent that I've spoken with about providing collateral, but how much would they need to provide? I went to the bank today to talk to them about alternatives to the SBA loans and they brought up secure and unsecure equity lines, but that would require a substantial investment on the part of the person providing collateral it sounds like. **Which type of loan should I get?** SBA loans would obviously be nice, but as the space is already empty and interest on it is high I'm in a huge hurry to get the lease signed and get the ball rolling. Location is everything, and this location is at the busiest intersection in town. I've heard SBA loans require a TON of paperwork and a long time to prepare and get approved for. **Also, Am I better off getting a 35k loan and possibly needing to ask for more or asking for a 50k loan to be safe? And what needs to be provided for collateral on a 35k loan?** I'll have ~12k worth of equipment which the bank would obviously want, do I need someone to put up the other 23k in either cash or assets?

As far as permits and licenses are concerned, it's been driving me nuts for a few hours now. You need permission to do anything from replacing a fence to putting up an inflatable pool in your yard. **It looks like the place to start is the health department, but they want a detailed plan of our kitchen etc., where do I get a floor plan of an existing building that's ~60 years old?**

Unfortunately, it is difficult to produce small runs (50 to 500 units) of the product efficiently, and meet the turnover for smaller agencies. Plus, the outlay for raw materials is not ""expensive"" but falls dramatically at 750-1000+ units...

I don't feel AT ALL like ""I've made it"", but I feel like I have found what I love and I'd like to help others do the same. I want to help others use their drive and innovation to give it a go. I've seen and heard of a few ""systems"" that combine micro loans to help small businesses and I'd like to join the fun.

I've looked at a few. The nicest ""looking"" sites seem to use 3rd-party lenders who charge interest to the recipients. I don't have an issue with borrowers paying interest, but I'd really like to see 95% of the loaned money go to the recipient (I know 5% is terrible return, but to me the interest is just part of ""learning about borrowing money"" and lower is better for very small businesses)

Anyone know of a project that lends to very small businesses with a solid repayment program and transparent and fair terms?

Ideally I'd like to donate to the following:

The Recipients:

1. VERY small businesses (scrappy individuals that just need a start)

2. Individuals who have a solid plan of action for the money (other than ""for inventory and overhead""). Essentially, cases where the money would ""change"" something for them

3. Business model has some plausible chance of making it

The System:

1. Interest is paid directly to the lenders, or the loans are zero interest

2. System maintains a transparent list of where borrowers are on their payments

3. System offers a list of businesses to choose from with the reasons for the loans

4. System can demonstrate success stories for their borrowers

I've looked at 3 - I won't post them here for fear of looking as if I'm promoting. A quick search and you'll probably find the same three. I'm really looking to hear from people who have worked with some system or who know someone who has.

An example of a system that I've liked to contribute to is KickStarter, but they have a different purpose.

To be clear, I don't intent to loan ""a lot"" of money. I'd just like to help in what small way that I can - $50 here, $100 there.

Suggestions?

EDIT: It just came to me that this could be construed as an offer to loan money to small businesses. That is NOT what I'm looking for here. I'm looking for a non-profit entity that allows me to donate to help THEM help small businesses.

Their business has been acceptable (enough for them to live on) for the past two years, but since February their orders have barely been coming in.  

Their primary source of customer orders comes in from their website. They do have a few wholesalers and drop-shippers, but direct to the customer is their primary source of income. They changed the website back in October to what I thought was a more user friendly version.

1364811172.0,9,self.smallbusiness,1bex12,New bakery in my neighbourhood and their sales strategy --&gt; Is this a good sales strategy?,freddypharkas,17,8,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1bex12/new_bakery_in_my_neighbourhood_and_their_sales/,"http://weird-economics.blogspot.com.es/2013/03/new-bakery-in-my-neighbourhood-and.html

Yesterday evening I was a little hungry and my stomach was asking for something sweet. So I went to the new bakery that opened two weeks ago just across the street. They had tons of applie pie, banana bread and many other biscuits and cakes which looked really good, but I decided to have two donuts.

When I ordered them, the shopkeeper said to me: ""Three donuts cost the same as two, 1.50€ - so I'll give you three, ok?"". ""Ok"", I answered, although I wasn't that hungry. ""One donut is 0.90€ and two or three donuts cost 1.50€"", the shopkeeper repeated. When I went back home I couldn't stop wondering whether such a ""three for two"" strategy was really appropiate for that new bakery. Shouldn't they sell two donuts at, let's say, 1.30€ and three at 1.50€?

I suppose you all know ""TheEconomist"", a monthly business news magazine. Some time ago they used a very similiar sales strategy as the bakery from my neighbourhood. I don't remember the exact prices, but a subscription to the printed version of The Economist cost around 60€, while the suscription to the online version cost 120€. And there was also a third option: the subscription to the print and online version also cost 120€. So what was the sense of the second option (online version only)? Who would prefer it over the third option? Most probably... nobody. Most likely, the second one was a kind of a benchmark for the other two and it made the third option look less expensive.

I guess the new bakery from my neighbourhood tries to apply the same sales strategy: three donuts may seem less expensive if they cost the same as two. I'd say it's a good idea as many people will end up buying three donuts instead of one. Nevertheless there may be one hitch: some people may want to eat only two donuts and not three, especially if they're on a diet or if they just count their calories (with one of those fancy calorie counters). But this is something that the bakery will have to figure out – I'll let you know you if they stick to this sales policy or not.

So I'm young and mostly foolish and my side-income Amazon business has turned into my only income, as I make far more money here than I did working my other crummy job(s).

All of this happened mostly by accident though. I just kinda fell into it, so I have two questions:

1) Should I start an LLC? I thought that was the natural next step and my parents so, ""Oh no, not necessarily"".

Apart from ""gettin' old and foolish"" (their words), why would starting an LLC not be the next step? Is there some reading I can do somewhere on advantages and disadvantages?

2) I'm currently selling in a niche market that I may want to abandon and work on something completely different (go from retail to service, essentially). Can I just start an LLC along the lines of, ""Generic Nonsense LLC"" and just funnel all income through it or do you start separate LLCs for separate revenue streams?

3) It looks like starting tomorrow, I may have an employee (contract labor - fixing stuff). Provided his income from me is high enough, can I send him a 1099 without an LLC or an EIN or anything? I'm just, as I put it, ""A Dude with an internet connection"".

His company primarily provides the installation, parts, and servicing for a new and specialized water purification technology. I am not currently living in the city where he is headquartered (about a 1000 miles or so away) and was asked to be some kind of regional distributor/vendor since he has no presence in that area out east. Rather than functioning merely as a rep and making 10% commission, it was suggested that I start my own business and represent them independently with higher commission. This sort of seems like some kind of franchising to be honest. I have been given access to their distribution centers and warehouses and will be given wholesale margins.  More importantly, I will be the sole presence here for this technology and it is indeed superior. Focusing on hotels first, this technology (if it replaced their current filtration system) would save a given hotel 25,000 to 100,000 gallons of water per year (depending on the size of the pool), not to mention the heating and chemical treatment costs on each of those gallons. Does this seem like a worthwhile endeavor?  Does starting my own business seem prudent in this situation?

Software:

Basically, I need the barcoding software to help us keep track and manage three basic areas: receiving inventory from vendors, outgoing products to customers, and counting/tracking inventory. For example, if I were to scan an item from a vendor with the scanner, the software will then let Quickbooks know (on the corresponding vendor purchase order) that such an item has arrived. 

So far, I have only really found one software that matches my criteria:

* 1. HandiFox: $1500 does all the stuff that I want and is integrated with Quickbooks. Hardware not included.

* 2. Fishbowl Inventory: Has a ""Mobile Warehouse"" extension that might do what I want, but the basic software itself costs over $4,000 per user, not including the extension itself.   

Hardware:

The most common hardware seems to be the Motorola Symbol MC9090, but it seems to be a bit pricey ($800-1300 depending on the version). Does anyone have experience with it or any other barcode scanner hardware? Is the Symbol overkill for a small warehouse? Overall, I don't mind paying for the Symbol if it's solid.

The basics, without getting too much into the details (I know it sounds like another bar, but there is more to it, I promise!)

- Small bar, small patio 
- No food is served or available (though it's there are street meat vendors outside)
- It isn't meant as an ""all night"" bar
- Near college territory, and close to other bars

I am part owner along with both of my parents, of two local Vitamin/Supplement/Natural Health Food etc stores. The nature of our business requires a Point of Sale system that is pretty robust as far as inventory/tracking/etc goes. This is mainly due to the fact that we have literally thousands of small bottles at all times. Keeping track of everything without a system is near impossible. At our original store, that was purchased many years ago, we have a system that the old owners implemented titled 'Keystroke POS'. A fitting name as it is most definitely a Piece Of Shit. Not a day goes by that we discover errors for inventory, orders, prices, etc which is blamed on the program. It is most likely due to the program being almost 15 years old. It is extremely clunky and slow, has a terrible UI, and is generally a pain to do any simple task. Most actions that should take maybe two or three clicks, usually require the navigation of 5-10 screens. For example, entering a new product into the system takes about 5 minutes per item, using anywhere up to 8 different screens. It is extremely inefficient to run our business with this outdated software any longer.

My problem, is that my parents are very against upgrading the system due to the extensive time it will take to enter thousands of products into the new system, as well as costing an arm and a leg. They insist that if we simply upgrade our current program, it will be much simpler and cheaper (this is not a false statement). However, Keystroke has the worst customer service in the world and I do not plan on keeping their software. Neither have I been able to find any good reviews or experience on the internet regarding their software.

 I have looked into the basic Quickbooks POS and was not impressed whatsoever. I have done research many times over the past two years on and off and never came to any conclusion on what will be worth our money. I ask you fellow reddit business owners: What do you use?

TL;DR: Our small business needs a new Point of Sale system, badly. What does everyone else use/like/hate/etc?

Edit:
Forgot to mention: Our second store which we recently purchased has no computer system. They do everything by hand which takes an agonizing amount of time to check in, price, check shelves to order, etc. Whichever system we decide to go with, we will implement into that store. It is not required, but some sort of multi-store interface would be a nice feature to have.",,False,self,t5_2qr34,False,,,True,t3_rq80p,http://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/rq80p/point_of_sale_systems_which_do_you_use_and_why/,

Help!  

Basics are:  
Opened in Oct 2012  
Invested $18,000 to open &amp; have only put in profits since to grow it  
Food biz with e-commerce website. Order online, we deliver regionally  
Food is perishable, costly to ship, needs refrigeration, short shelf life  
I have no brick and mortar  
My niche is BOOMING &amp; attracted big players (think Starbucks type)  
I have no employees. I make it myself with 2 family members. None of us are paid  
I have independent contractor delivery drivers  
Since Oct 2012, I have $68k in sales  
Assets include, e-commerce website, kitchen equipment, packaging, registered trademark, recipes, solid reputation online (reviews)  
Dollar value of equipment+inventory is $37k  
Debt is $5k on credit cards (still paying off equip)  

I can't afford to open a brick and mortar and feel that is the next logical step to grow the business. Competition in this niche is FIERCE. Think cup cake crazy of 2008ish. The market is new but over-saturated with competitors with $ to spend on opening multiple locations in 2013 and tons of ads.

The cons (to a buyer) with selling that I see are that sales are low (right?), I don't really have a staff as my family and I would no longer be involved if we sold, customer base is still very small, biz is in its infancy, if they do their homework they'll realize how over-saturated it is.  

Reasons I want to sell are if I feel like I'm bringing a fork to a gun fight. When I launched I saw a great opportunity in a growing area, it IS growing but these bigger (also new) companies are launching so aggressively I'm having a hard time getting mine to take off. Also, I'm not paying myself and won't be for reasonably another 1-2 yrs. My gut says that this isn't going to grow into the business I thought it would and I'd rather focus my time and energy into something I feel has more potential.  Obviously not my sales pitch to potential buyers but being 100% honest here.

I have suppliers, some of which are overseas, for Intel and AMD lines of processors, including new retail box, OEM, used, and tray packed processors. I intend to begin dealing in desktop and laptop CPU's only, no server or larger stuff. 

The prices I can purchase at are typically bulk, MOQ's are usually 10 processors and for upscale processors that can be $10000 or more. But the bulk prices leave me room to undercut big box retailers.

The platforms I am looking at for selling are Ebay, Amazon, and other lesser auction and retail sites, including some less secure places like Craigslist.

I have applied for LLC status and I will open a business account at my bank when I get it. I have $6000 that I have put into ordering CPU's. I am starving for inventory because I can move these processors nearly as fast as I can order them. I plan to operate out of my house. I have opened a Paypal business account to accept payments to make things easier. My ROI before ebay/paypal costs will be about 30%, which is why I am pursuing this. 

My questions to you business veterans:

What's my next move? Do I seek investment to expand business?

Do I develop a business plan/model?

Do I go to a bank for a line of credit or loan?

Do I go to a tax professiona/lawyer for their expert advice on taxes, legalities, etc?

We assign a team of four writers to compose well thought out responses to every review on Google+ and Yelp!. We create engaging content on Facebook, to create friend-to-friend recommendations. We reach out to people on Twitter in your local area. Example: Someone is vocalizing their thoughts on Twitter (which everyone does) about needing new tires before their road trip. We actually reach out to them and try to recruit them to your business. We have found this to be tremendously effective in building a customer base. We also utilize Foursquare in ways that we know are effective. Such as if someone leaves a negative 'tip' at your competitor, we will privately reach out to them and recruit them to your business. We do all of this ""as the business owner"" so it encourages a business/client relationship to develop.**

We're thinking about re-branding and incorporating this year mainly for tax purposes.

I've never had a lot of money before, but suddenly this is taking off. In the past few months, we've made over $25k and we're booked through February. We're expecting to make over $100k in 2013.

Each client we work with is a bit different. Sometimes they make us sign an I9, othertimes a W9 or other ones I don't even remember (we have it all written down, of course). Most often, though, our clients just pay us and I don't sign anything (under the table, I guess that would be called). I'm a little worried about taxes this year, but we're going to a CPA who will hopefully help us figure everything out (I'm putting aside $2k for taxes).

I know we need a business license or to form a company somehow. People have recommend that we incorporate, but I don't really know enough about it. I'm also pretty bad with my personal finances, especially with saving money. But I'm more than ready for that to change.

We work out of home, so our business expenses are next to nothing. We pay a voice actor to do recordings for each video, but that's about all. I do have some more electronics I need to get (I'm in desperate need of a new camera and lenses). Just a couple months ago I purchased a new MacBook Pro (which I'm hoping I can write off). Should I look into getting a business loan of some sort to build up our equipment? I could realistically spend $10-15k and have a much better setup to work with. My own personal credit isn't perfect, but it's not horrible (I think it's about 750). I have a small amount of personal debt (around $7500) and so does my girlfriend (around $3500).

This year, we're planning on working toward getting rid of all our debts, building up our equipment so we can produce higher quality work (and work more quickly), getting my girlfriend a car, getting health insurance for both of us, re-branding, incorporating, and starting to save towards other major things (ex: we plan on getting married in a couple years).

As it stands right now, we will not make it through the year if things continue the way they have been. Now, I would take responsibility for this failure, but it truly isn't my fault. To a point, I am manager in title only. Most decisions still have to be cleared by the owner. Mine get shot down all the time, I'd give you examples, but I don't want this thing to go on forever. Sometimes it's just things being done inefficiently, other times they are just bad policies. We haven't turned a profit in 2-3 years according to the bookkeeper who is his wife. I'm not allowed to see the books, so I don't even know how we did week to week, month to month unless she tells me. She wants my help too because they have spent all their savings, taken out loans, and can't really afford to fail. They won't lose their home, that's paid off fortunately, but it won't be easy on them.

The problem is, anymore, this industry changes too quickly to still be doing things the way you did them in the 80's when you opened it.

What are your main strategy when you try to take accounts from the behemoths of the industry?  For me for example, I am up against Sysco, US Foods, and other large companies.

I will get it going with my strategy.  I keep my ear to the ground and dig up every lead no matter the size.  I work upwards of 80 hours a week so I am always doing something to make sure my business is growing.  

I am also always on the look out for new and exciting products.  Sysco might have 10 different brands of chips but if I have that one nobody has ever heard of, I have that advantage.  I am always on websites, going to conventions, simply googling for new suppliers and always paying attention to the market.  If I notice a big guy started carrying a specific type of product (kale chips for example), there is a good chance there is another company out there making the same product but is not with Sysco and would jump at the opportunity to get in my 50 accounts.

Since we're a community it is only logical that we discuss what type of posts should be considered so off topic or lacking in value that they be eliminated by mod rather than just voted on by the general community.

**Official Reddit definition of spam:** The official Reddit definition of posting spam is ""Submitting only links to your blog or personal website"" or repeated posts to multiple subreddits.  It's really the only hard guideline we have and it's probably best that we operate within it. The question is if other guidelines would improve or detract from the value of /r/smallbusiness.

**Why do they spam:** Usually spam is about either making money from the reader or improving web presence though manipulating search engines. Since the cost of posting is essentially zero a post that makes even a nickel is worth doing and if it's worth doing once it's worth doing a thousand times (and probably worth it to a thousand different people).

**Why ban any spam, can't we just vote it out?** The concern is that subreddits that welcome spam tend to fill with spam until more valuable content becomes impossible to find in the new post queue. Logical spammers for our community would be Amazon affiliate linkers, credit card processing companies, SEO offerings and links to ad farms. Personally as a small business owner I'm spammed continuously with telecommunications offers, cash advance schemes, health insurance programs and questionable value certifications/training as well. If they knew they could get attention from thousands of readers I'd expect them to come here.

**So what should you do?** Post now about what you consider spam, what is legitimate business promotion and what criteria would add to our community. This is your chance to shape its future.

Me and my wife want to start selling homemade dog biscuits and eventually more types of dog treats. We're specializing in vegan and allergy free. My parents dog had a beef allergy, one of mine has a wheat allergy and we know a few people whose dogs have allergies and have talked to more. So we know there's a good market available, especially since several bakeries near us sell doggie cupcakes (obviously wheat flour and PB so useless to us).

We have all the equipment we need, I think all that is left is dropping $60 for a dehydrater. I'm going to be making the website, just Wordpress based, my brother is a professional developer so I've got him if need be.

We contacted the ministry of agriculture and they said the only thing we need to do to sell is get the crude levels (fat, carb, protein and moisture) tested and stick to the labeling guidelines. No false advertising etc. (no shit stuff basically)

There is a local online retailer that is fairly big, mainly selling dog clothes and accessories, but they take on a lot of smaller brands. So once we get a few products tested we're going to try to get them to carry us.

We're going to be giving out free samples to local dog grooming salons for them to give out with a business card. We're also might do ""commissioned"" cakes, like a birthday cake that dogs can eat. The irony being we can sell these unlabeled to humans, but would have to pay for testing to sell it to those humans dogs.

My wife has a lot of experience with finances due to her job, so balance sheets, etc should be easy.

I can't think of anything else, so would love some input from you guys.

Oh, 5-year plan. This is really dependent on profitability and growth. Obviously when/if it makes enough my wife will be leaving her day job (as this was her idea and she's the backbone of it). Our personal 20 year plan was to move to a 50-acre property, which would certainly happen sooner if this business takes off as it would mean a chance to vertically integrate literally from the soil to the distribution.

Unfortunately I was not made to be a salesman and I failed.

So I invited to join to two unemployed friends that are very talkative and I suspected they could be good salesmans. This was a few months ago.
And so was it that they got some clients and we start making money. At the beginning I told them that each one would earn for what they do. So if they get a client that needs a computer repaired and they get the client and repair the computer, all the money is for him. My objective was to make them do something as they can be very lazy. I read that usually you earn for the porcentage you invest but this didn't required any money to start. And we are very young , we just earn enough for food and booze and we live with our moms.

The idea was to do something and have everyone happy. The thing is they already learn the basics of the business and I feel they will leave me aside as they will sell and do everything by themself, so they don't have to share money with each other. And because they can sell and I don't, I'm fucked.

I'm worried and want to change the rules. I have this whole idea for the business, invited them, came up with a name for the business, make the webpage, logo, business card for everyone, panflets for clients, etc. I'm also the one they have to resort when dificult troubles arrise, as I'm the geek in the group.
I have a very good relationship with them and they are not trying to kick me out, it's just the rules I imposed weren't apropiate, I thought they would always need me for something and I would have work too.

Dividing the money by fixed percentages will not work, they can be very lazy and they will do nothing and expect to receive money. Also it may happen that one coud get a client and not tell anyone else so he won't have to share the money.

I want to propose something that everyone is happy with, that considers how much you worked but gets the others in too.

So I would like to know how it is supposed that we share all, is there a general rule?

I guess the issue boils down to, how do you start picking up end user clients that are comfortable working with a small dev shop instead of a contractor? Clearly Internet marketing is saturated, so I'm guessing just local networking?

FYI, my freelance business is capping weekly billable hours, so the only way to scale my current business would be to increase my rates.

**Not anymore**   

With tools like Asterix IP-PBX, X-Lite call-agent software and [SoftXpand](http://www.miniframe.com) Multiseat software, you can set up an environment for 8 agents or higher **using just one PC**.   

Here is a [demo video](http://youtu.be/78glVsJJHPo) made by Srdan, a user from Slovenia.
   
The ingredients: 
 
**Asterix IP-PBX**:   
There are plenty of freeware versions of Asterix, which you can set up on a Linux or Windows machine.   
   
**Agents PC:**
This computer (Windows-7) should be scaled up reasonably for running multiple sessions. For example, i3 CPU and 8 GB of RAM should work fine for 8 agents working at the same time.   
To expand a single PC for 8 workstations, just connect 8 of each:   
* Monitor: multiple monitors can be connected using multiple video cards (e.g. Nvidia NVS-210, available for $30), or LAN Zero Clients such as HP T200.   
* USB hub.   
* USB keyboard.   
* USB audio adapter (typically $15) and a headset.   
   
**Software set up**   
* Set up 8 Windows accounts.   
* Install [X-Lite](http://www.counterpath.com/x-lite.html).   
* Install [SoftXpand 2011](http://www.miniframe.com/products/softxpand/softxpand-2011.html).   
* Use SoftXpand to configure 8 workstations.   
* Use X-Lite to configure audio devices per agent.

2. Creates a price quote (that will be saved in the DB)
3. The price quote would contain the following searchable fields, customer name, companies name of customer, customers phone/fax etc., the date, the quote number, the product number, descriptions of item.  

The system would need to take the input and generate a PDF.  This PDF would be downloadable.

Some points that have prevented us from using other systems...

1. Our product numbers are very different and we do not have any inventory (think of it as infinite).  We must be able to enter any product number at the time we are creating the price quote.
2. We do not collect tax, so there must be no mention or calculation of taxes.

For our purchase Orders:


1. Our sales person(s) is able to login.
2. Creates a PO.
3. The PO must contain the following searchable fields, the customer name, the PO #, the date, the manufacturer (our supplier), the customer location, my companies sales person name, product numbers, descriptions.  




Notes: 

1. We must also be able to edit the FOB Factory field, freight prepay and add field, terms (net 30 days), pricing validity length.  These hardly ever change but they sometimes do.  We will also need to be able to edit the ""Please address to ..."" line as sometimes we need PO made out directly to our factories and not to us.
2. If search could be exportable to CSV, that would be a dream.
3. The system must keep a record of every PQ, and PO.  Be able to create, edit, and delete them.
4. The PO entry should not depend on their being a correlating PQ.


Any ideas? Have questions?  I probably left details out, let me know.  I could really use some help here.  We are doing everything by hand on paper and, I believe we could become more efficient, and be able to calculate more accurately our best selling items if we went digital.

We have a relatively [new site](https://kissprinting.com) which is a niche printing service with a twist. The customer gets to determine our profit and we give 50% of it away to charity. Kind of a pay what you want print service.

I am curious about the drop off rate from items being added to the cart vs completed checkouts.  I have a Google Analytcs goal [seen here] (http://i.imgur.com/DC7rv1f.png) to track where the drop offs happen.  For anonymity I am not putting the time frame on there.  I am hoping for some discussion and points of reference, to see if this is a good or bad completion rate.

For simplicity we have made the checkout process pretty much one page.  Should I spread it out and make it a multi-step process to track exactly where the drop offs are occurring? I.E. Shipping, picking the profit, entering the credit card, etc.  I don't really want to do that if not necessary as I feel it goes against the KISS principle.

Summary:  
73% of users that place an item in the cart proceed to the checkout page.  
14% of users that go to the checkout page complete their order.  
10% of users that place an item in their cart make a purchase.

We were working with a lawyer recently on an unrelated issue, but he has a lot of experience with employment law. When I asked him how to handle feedback, his advice was vague and basically he said that the gov't/legal view is that if a company is unsatisfied with a contractor, then it makes business sense to simply dissolve the contract. I get this view, but in the real business world, there are times that customer feedback comes in that is not super detrimental, but should be addressed. Have any of you dealt with this? Part of me wonders if I'm over thinking this in that I don't think our contractors are unhappy and would file any claims against us, but there are times that I want to address feedback with them without breaking the law and also I want to come from a place of genuine respect for the work they do with our clients.

Seeing this as a potential market, I did some testing took out a classified ad in the paper telling about a summer robotics course for ages 14-18 with a link to a landing page I created. There were a decent amount of hits to the page, considering it all came from one small ad.

I'd like to pursue this as a business opportunity. Giving multi-day afterschool programming/robotics classes to middle/high schoolers. Groups of 5 at a time most likely. Packages would be 3-5 of 2 hour sessions which would teach the basics of programming/web site design/building a small robot, etc; something that could be done in that time frame.

Everything is pretty much set to go and my partner and I are extremely ecstatic. Unfortunately we are having some problems with the closing.

 It all started at the time of signing a purchase agreement. We had decided against retaining a broker, and sought advice from a family member to make sure everything was kosher. Our adviser ran a multimillion dollar company for many years, so we felt his advice to be sound.  He told us that it would be in our best interest to begin 30 days of training before closing. We liked the idea, because it offered us a clean break after all was said and done.  We wrote up the purchase agreement, and %10 of the purchase price was nestled away in escrow, all under the contingency that the buyer could obtain a lease.  Nearly two months later and he's still negotiating a lease, and we're at a loss of what to do.

The first 2 weeks were at a standstill due to our landlord being out of town.  The next 2 weeks were spent waiting for the landlords counter offer.  The last 3 weeks have simply been us giving him the benefit of the doubt. He's explained that he's under pressure from his investor to obtain a more lucrative lease. It's 8 days till our final ultimatum and I really don't want to screw this up, though I might have already done so by not shelling out the cash for a proper broker.

I could just stick it out for another week but the buyer is a complete monster.  He does not wear underwear, his ass crack follows me round the store like gargoyle eyes. He's a complete sexist and alludes to my stupidity daily. The worst thing is that I have been training him for two months and he does not know a thing, everyday he asks me how to turn the internet on, it doesn't work like that bro.  I can't take it anymore.

My worst fear is that doing training before closing was a mistake, and that he's simply trying to weasel out of the agreement by taking too long with the lease.  Could he be pretending to be such a animal, that we simply cut him loose, in lieu of the escrow money?  I feel that my only option is to stop anymore training until I see a lease, is this immoral business etiquette?

1366746327.0,7,self.smallbusiness,1cygdf,Looking to start a smoothie/juice bar (x-post from r/startups),HelloImJeff,9,2,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1cygdf/looking_to_start_a_smoothiejuice_bar_xpost_from/,"A few years ago I worked at a very successful shop with some friends that closed due to the owners retiring. I've contacted a few of my old coworkers and we're interested in reopening it and adding some things to the menu (juice, bubble tea, frozen yogurt). We're in a decent sized college town and the location we've got picked is actually right across the street from the college campus next to one of the busiest intersections in town. It's got a great level of foot traffic and visibility is perfect. 

I'm in the process of putting together a business plan, but I'm fairly new to this. I've started one ""business"" before, but it's just a relatively small produce stand - no paperwork, permits, tax registration, etc.

A few questions I had, they're a little long but I appreciate any help:

1.  How should I structure the company regarding the other five ""partners"". The idea, business plan, and all the startup funding are coming from me, but we've been developing and tweaking the idea together for a few weeks. Obviously it isn't practical or logical to assume a five-way equal profit-loss share, but they'll all be working in the store and rather than start with five part time employees it would be easier financially and legally if they were part owners. Can I start them out as ""probationary"" owners and pay them in company shares for a set number of time until they own a certain percentage, then once they reach that percentage (5-10%?) start paying them hourly wage along with a small portion of profits? Like an LLC? Or should I set up a sole proprietorship? I'm not too familiar with company structures. Any recommendations?

2.  I'll need to get a loan from the bank. I've talked to someone that is willing to put up ~$50K collateral on a loan once they see my business plan. What type of loan should I get and what do I need to get it? I've heard the amount of paperwork to get an SBA loan is astronomical and I should pursue a personal loan if I can get it. Knowing I have excellent credit and $50k collateral, do you agree with that?

3. I've done a lot of market research on the demographics in the area where we're opening, and I'm assuming I can go to any store or food supplier and get information on product costs, but how do I get information for things like a one and three year profit/loss projection? Are these just based off arbitrary numbers I anticipate for sales? If I were to call one of the competitors in the area it doesn't seem like they would be extremely open to sharing their books with me..?

4. How long should a business plan be? I can go into thirty pages of detail on the demographic, startup costs, idea, location, food costs, etc. but is that too long? Should I create a condensed version or powerpoint and provide everything else as needed? I've seen business plans that are anywhere from 10-50 pages long and there doesn't seem to be a general consensus on which format is the best.

5. We plan on filing to legally protect the idea, something the previous owners never did. We would need to file a trademark rather than a copyright, right? I'm not interested in protecting the logo, color scheme, etc. but more so the underlying theme and basic idea of the restaurant.

I'm starting a new small business in which I will need to transport myself to and from work sites over the Greater Vancouver Area.  I will not need to haul a lot of weight, but I do need a fair amount of volume.  I will be taking small ladders with me on occasion, but mostly just a minimal amount of tools (50 lbs. max).  I will offer garbage removal from my work sites (packing styrofoam, paper and some plastic) and this can take up a fair bit of space.  Having this garbage out of the rain would be a huge plus.

Most small pickup trucks in my budget (sub-$6000) get horrendous mileage.  Here in Vancouver, gas is up around $1.40/L ($5.29/Gallon) and I expect to rack up hundreds of kilometres per week.  Whatever I end up with will be my daily use vehicle outside of work as well.

As much as I hate the idea of driving a minivan, it seems to make a lot of sense given my needs.  Are there any other options I should consider?

I do not have enough workers, and I am forced to keep letting people go. The reasons vary, in the last year I have had two serious situations (stealing, loosing temper for personal reasons at a job), but it is usually smaller things (repeated lateness, missing a day of work, showing up to work smelling of alcohol, slacking/tired at work, having a bad attitude...).  

I try to be a very good ""boss"". Whenever they need an advance or have a problem I love when my guys come to me for help and I pretty much always come through.

I currently find workers by posting ads on craigslist and trying to find more movers from my current movers. I try to only hire guys who have previous experience working for moving companies - even ambitious guys end up learning from the mistakes they make on my time which I have to pay for ultimately. I am looking for people who know how to wrap and move furniture, are reliable, have a cellphone and have a decent attitude. 

I am fairly young (24) and I thought that maybe my employees get envious of my business and that's where the issues come from, so for a while I asked my father to prescreen, interview, hire and work with the new guys. He seems to have even worse luck than me.

I have a question on behalf of my mom, a SB owner who's not a redditor. She owns a small/mid-sized retail business—the sales dept. payroll is heavily commission-based. The top salesman, ""Stu,"" went through some tough personal times in the last couple years. His wife ended up supporting her gambling addiction by embezzling from  her employer. She was convicted and incarcerated; they divorced, and Stu had to file chapter 13 personal bankruptcy. His restructuring (or whatever it's called) involves wage garnishment, the amount of which is tied to his own income. He's been unwilling to sell above a certain amount because of this. I don't know how they know how much he *could* sell, but both Stu and mom seem to agree on the amount he's not earning, which sounds rather considerable (she mentioned that the difference in his take-home would be +/- $20,000). Maybe that's just arrived at by comparison with his previous years' earnings? 

Anyway, after his divorce Stu started dating and moved in with Felicia, a trusted friend of mom's who is *also* a *former* employee at the business. Now Stu wants to start earning at his most productive level only *if* mom pays his surplus commission to Felicia. 

It sounds like mom would be personally OK with this arrangement, but she wants to know just how much it would be stretching...er...well, *legality*, I suppose. So she tasked me with this research project of poking around on the internet and seeing what I could come up with. Being a redditor, I of course thought I'd turn here first.

I was planning on using my families accountant but since he was local, and he sounded like the best of the best, I figured I would pay the extra $50 per month. Cost is $165 per month, plus $300 setup fee. $900 for year end filing (Which I thought was bogus considering he only has to look at numbers for less than one quarter). I paid 1/3 of the setup fee oct/nov/dec and his monthly fee for nov/dec. I have also paid his $165 fee in Jan + 1 of 4 installments on the $900 so $325 for January. 

Sunday during the superbowl he emails me with my projected amount owed to the IRS. The email went something like this: ""Hey Jacob, It looks like you're going to owe $8,124. I'm attaching a coupon so you can get that sent out""

Wait. What? You haven't even asked me about my expenses for the year. You have obviously done your math wrong since my business actually LOST about 7,000 for 2012.  What the hell are you talking about? You must have emailed the wrong person!

Today I emailed him and told him I was going to find someone else. It was a polite email and I stated that because of my families contribution to the business, they insist I use their accountant. 

He then emailed me back saying that all the work has been done and if I don't pay him the $900, he is taking me to court. 

What do I do? I don't want to pay him and have him do my taxes wrong. I don't want to pay him, and then pay someone else to do them right. I don't want him taking me to court. He also has my corporate binder that he was going to have completed by his attorney for an additional $200. He insists that the corporate and personal filings are done, but how can they be if the man never even asked how much money I paid in tolls, and hasn't received my w-2 from my previous employer? 

UPDATE: In our exchanges, he mentioned that he would settle for $700 if I paid him today. I went to the office today and got my corporate binder, and gave him a check for $475. At this point he was unaware of the $225 he already drafted from me in January. Once I explained the amount to him, I pointed out that this was the kind of oversight which would lead someone to look elsewhere. 

He did say I could email him all expenses and he would finish my return, so I am going to make him work for it.

Today I read in a related subreddit that when you have a small business, you can often gain a small tax advantage by setting a salary for yourself and your partner less than what you make and then paying a distribution / dividend at the end of the year. This way you can avoid the self employment tax on the distribution part of your income. 

We have a CPA but he has never once mentioned doing our taxes like this, so we dutifully pay in many thousands of dollars in taxes every year.  Aside from the tax benefits, I am also interested in this idea because it would allow us each to have a set, dependable, very regular salary and would make book keeping so much easier.

So my questions are - 

1.  Would this be an advantageous way for us to organize our finances? This could also allow the company to purchase items/services throughout the year because of the large build-up of cash in the bank account.

2.  If this is a legitimate way to do this, why the hell hasn't our CPA mentioned it? Should we switch CPAs?

3.  Are there any drawbacks to organizing this way?

4.  And slightly related - When a CPA is organizing the taxes for the year, what questions should he/she be asking you? Our CPA doesn't seem to file anything unless I specifically mention it to him (IE that we had a new child or that we bought a new house or that we paid student loan interest, etc...)

I would love to hear about your experiences scaling up your business. My girlfriend and I run a business in one city and we are in the process of expanding to a new city. We currently do all of the administrative work in-house, but with our expansion (and with plans to expand to other cities in the future) we are not sure how to manage the increase in administrative work. We have to do scheduling, billing, technical support, and other tasks that are very time consuming. 

Eventually we will need to hire someone to help. We want to keep everything in-house as long as possible to reduce our costs, but soon we will be left without a choice. We want to be prepared for the transition into having a business manager. We are already planning to make everything ""modular"" and have best practices and templates to use, as well as written instructions for everything.

* At what point in the size of your business did you hire a business manager or administrative assistant? How many hours a week were you working?

* How do you deal with the fear of an employee starting a business of their own to compete with you? Especially since with billing they will know **exactly** how much we make (and exactly how much they make relative to our profits). 

* How do you avoid the temptation to micromanage? We treat our clients like gold and I am afraid to hand those relationships to someone else.

We may use 20 different parts in one of the products we build one day and we would like to have a way where we can enter in daily what we've built and have it subtracted from our total inventory so we can better keep up with how far what parts we've ordered get us and when we need to order more. If there is a way to say enter the name of the product we built and have the program just subtract that total number of parts inside away, that's most preferable and it could become very labor intensive to just go in and subtract one or two tiny $0.02 resistors from a list of 400 multiple times every time we build something. Does that make any sense?

If there is any freeware out there that does this, I'd prefer that, but anything that works well we'll be interested in.

It would remove some stress and give more freedom for himself and his employees to take time off. Technically, he is no longer a newsagent, having removed the paper delivery service, and is able to not open Sundays, but he is unsure of what things might happen beyond upsetting 15 or so elderly regulars and losing some revenue. It might pay to add that last on the last tax, he broke into the lower end of a higher tax bracket and wouldn't mind losing some profit to go into a lower bracket.

My dad owns a retail business selling tile and all sorts of flooring and home/kitchen/bath remodeling products from setting material, to backsplash, to countertops, and etc etc. We are located in Southern California and our industry has been crushed by the housing market crash and recession. We used to have several branches and properties but we are now down to our main showroom and our warehouse. Our showroom is in a high traffic area, referred to as ""tile mile"" in Anaheim, it is an area where 3 out of 4 buildings are occupied by tile stores. So even without advertising we get a pretty high volume of foot traffic, especially on the weekends. On top of that, our company has been in business for close to 20 years so we have a lot of repeat customers. We also have another branch in Downey which is a bit south of downtown Los Angeles but that store gets 0 walk in customers. When I say zero, I literally mean zero. It's located on a very busy street right near the freeway, we have big signs and a big showroom but we get absolutely zero walk in customers and we barely get any business from there. I want to say a big reason for that is because it is located in sort of a poor area but I really don't know. We have tried some advertising for this store but didn't see enough of a change to continue advertising. 

Our company has advertised before, especially when they were getting started and they have dabbled here and there. But, I'd say for 97.5% of the company's existence, they haven't advertised. I'm wondering how much advertising could possibly help. Our industry is struggling, but there are always going to be people fixing their homes. Even though we are struggling, we see a pretty decent number of people coming to our store. I see two solutions, 
A) either get a higher percentage of the people already coming to our store to give us their business, or 
B) increase the number of people coming to our store so that even if a low % of people are buying, at least it's a higher number.

I've brought this up with my dad many times but I haven't pushed the issue because I'm not convinced it will have an impact. But my dad doesn't seem to think advertising is an issue / it won't make much of an impact. His reasoning is 

A) if you google us we already come up (although this is if you type in our name, if you type in looser search terms like ""tile in anaheim"" we're on like the 3rd or 4th page or something like that)

B) if we advertise our store, all of the customers will just walk down the line and go to our 2 neighbor stores (which are also tile stores, both of which are much bigger than us) 

I have no idea who is right, but we HAVE to do something different. I feel like there has to be something we can do to do better. One thing is we have never tried local online advertising. I don't know much about it, but it does make sense that with online advertising you can target a more ideal audience than something like pennysavers or your local newspaper especially in this day and age where most everyone googles everything they want to find out. 

I'm working on a website to start with so that we have somewhere to direct our customers, but I'm wondering if it's worth it. There's only one way to find out I suppose but I just don't have enough experience or knowledge regarding this to have any sort of confidence. 

If I could get your guys' input I would be forever grateful. If you guys need to know more specifics feel free to ask me any questions to clear up anything or to get more details. Thanks in advance! Sorry for the wall of text!

People seem to like the shirts, but sales have been slower than I expected.

I've done some SEO, but that feels a bit useless at this point because that's a battlefield full of giants, and none of my designs are anything anyone's going to be searching for. (Their obscurity is kind of their whole point)

I've tried Google Adwords, even got some advice from a professional on them, but with their cost per click, I don't see them ever being profitable for me.

I've tried banner ads through Project Wonderful.. the conversion rate has been abysmal.

My page on Facebook is the most exciting place for me, I've been pleased with the number of people interacting with it. But ever since I stopped paying for Facebook ads (I would prefer not to) it's growth has been frustratingly slow. Also, when I post about random things, people engage, but if I mention my business (sales, new free shipping policy, website redesign) they do a pretty good job of ignoring it.

I have a thing on my site right now (link is at the bottom) where people can post flyers for a free shirt. One person has taken me up on it so far, and I actually got some decent traffic from that area when they did. I think if I could get more traffic so people could find out about that opportunity, that could be good and fun.

But so far I haven't had much luck. Any advice would be very appreciated!

Later, liquidate these assets when capital is needed (avoiding paying personal income tax) and growing the company. What taxes, besides capital gains, would be levied on buying equities/bonds?

I share an Delaware LLC with two other people. At the end of the year, regardless of whether we take a disbursement or not, we still have to pay taxes on it.  While I believe this structure to be best for us right now, there's not that much incentive to leave money in the company.

For example, if at the end of the year we make $3000 profit and we decide not to pay ourselves, we still have to pay personal taxes on it. This is tricky because we are paying ourselves low salaries to grow the company. We would rather leave that money IN the business for expenses, to pay employees, and create a safety net in case times are tough when we go full time.

Instead, the past two years we've opted to leave our money in the company and I end up paying thousands in taxes. It's tempting to say, well I should just start taking money from the company to cover the taxes. However, I believe that strategy can limit our growth and actually sway us from hiring more employees.

Thanks for any and all advice!

Loads of personal back story drama, but, the essentials at this point:

I handed them 40K last year to get the business started, another 2k in Jan as a bailout loan that I told them not to worry about.

Parents gambling and poor fiscal management have driven them to pawn anything and everything of worth, including a 10k embroidery machine I purchased for them only 3 months ago. 

They claim to have since banned themselves from the casinos, not sure if this is possible or true. I feel awkward asking them for proof.

Now that I am added to the bank account, I looked up the most recent 3 months transaction history. I saw:

* ~$750 overdraft charges and ATM fees
* ~$10,000 withdrawn from ATMs
* ~$4,000 in personal purchases (food, redbox, etc.)

I need to establish some sort of payroll, and ensure my Mom gets her own personal account. 

Business income 12 month rolling average is about $5500, minimum 4 month rolling average at $3200. 

I'm now going to get caught up on backreading, but the pressing concern of mine at the moment is their point of sale transaction agreement with Eliot management group. Basic searching on the group reveals some very deceptive business practices:

* http://www.cardpaymentoptions.com/credit-card-processors/eliot-management-group/
* http://www.bbb.org/utah/business-reviews/credit-services/eliot-management-group-in-salt-lake-city-ut-4000142

* As I am taking over as CFO, are the previous CFOs contracts valid? 
* Are there any methods to properly end a ridiculous self serving contract that meets the letter of the law, but does not meet the verbally discussed up front terms?",,False,self,t5_2qr34,1346552986.0,,,True,t3_z6f9k,http://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/z6f9k/rescuing_my_parents/,

Here's the problem...,Oaktree3,10,2,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/yocqa/i_think_i_may_have_been_given_counterfeit_money/,"A client of mine gave me a $100 bill. It looked funny and I commented.  He said that's because it's from 1977. Sure enough, it says 1977 on it. Fine. He tells me that this is money from his relative that kept money hidden away so as to go unreported to the IRS. Fine, I get it, some folks do that.  

Then advises me to be careful where I spend it,  and launches into this story about how the IRS came after him. He told me that money this old comes up counterfeit with the counterfeit detecting pens because it is made with different paper than the money today.  He had payed a worker a few of these old $100s and told him to **not** go to the bank with it. Well the worker did, and the bills were sequential and came up fake when the pen was used on them. This looked highly suspicious, so the bank seized the money and then questioned the worker about where he obtained this money, and this led to the IRS coming after him.

My question is, could this story be true? Is money from 1977 made from different paper than money now? Have I been had? Now what do I do with this money if it's fake? I do not want to be out $100 because he's a criminal. Help! Please refrain from telling me I'm am idiot for taking it. Thank you


**EDIT**: I really appreciate your responses. I'm going to call him today and ask him to come back and give me 5 modern $20s. Thanks for being gentle.  A little back story: I met this guy at a business networking event, and have known him and his family for a few years. Nice people. This was shocking to say the least. I will update you if I hear back from him. 

**Edit** Called him, left a message to the effect of ""I need to ask you a question, please get back to me asap""  Let you know what I hear back.

**Edit** I made the first call around 8:45 this morning.  No response. I made a second call at 11:30. No response yet. 

**Edit** In case anyone is still here and curious, I'll give you the latest update. I went into my bank to deposit a few checks. I asked to speak with a branch manager. I told her that I was told by someone that money from the 70's and older comes up counterfeit with the pen and is that true? She said it is true, and that the paper was treated with different chemicals then. So real money could in fact show up as fake with the pen. Since there were no watermarks or metallic strip put into the money then, thats the only way vendors can judge it. 

Basically that's all I needed to know.  I left and went to the shop to call him again, this time from the land line so maybe I can trap him into answering. It worked, only it was the wife. I know her well so I told her that her husband gave me money that's too difficult for me to use, and god forbid it gets taken away from me because it's so old and comes up counterfeit. I told her I needed him to come in and exchange it for more modern bills either today or tomorrow. She said sure and she'd have him call me. Now I wait.

**Final Update**
    I emailed him on Friday evening stating the events: What he said to me when he gave me the money, the times of day of each time I called him, what was said when I spoke to his wife and then again the times I attempted to reach him on Friday. I also stated I was very disappointed in his behavior, avoiding and not returning calls is no way to treat a fellow small business owner, and it is not right that he give and expect me to use money with so many ""rules"" on it.  I ended with ""Meet me at my place of business by Monday 5:00pm or I will take this matter to the authorities"".  Guess who immediately emailed me back.  After a couple go-rounds and excuses including ""Use the money like any other money"" and he's ""bed-ridden with a health issue"" and ""Now I'm at the hospital"", as well as telling me to come to his house, I just stuck to my guns and kept repeating Monday by 5:00pm.  Well, yesterday morning he emailed me saying he could meet me to exchange the money. I brought my fiance and met him at a coffee shop to exchange it. He was all apologies and said he had a back injury that made him honery on the emails and he was sorry for the hassle. He then volunteered that he had ""several hundred thousand"" dollars worth of this old money he's been ""trying to run through the system"".  Well, whatever, that's his adventure. I'm just relieved I have a nice legitimate modern hundred in my possession.

So I certainly see relevance there and I think that customers could feel more connected this way, and also our website which has only been up for like 4 months brought in a new customer so that probably makes up for the expense of creating the website.

I would like to market an educational class I developed several years ago (and am currently updating). It's actually a series; skills and knowledge are practiced between classes. When I first gave the class, it was when I was an employee and ""free"" to those who attended. It got good reviews from the people who took it then. Now, I'd like to market it to the public at large. 

Others in my field who market w/in the community generally get very small turnout. I have the idea not only doing my own marketing (within the community and networking, flyers, etc) but also seeking out internists/family practitioners in larger practices. I'd ask them if I could present in a conference room or other room within their practice (saves rental costs) and to post flyers within the practice or building, as well as refer appropriate patients from their own practice. I provide the actual class. My part takes a considerable amount of expertise and research time (I actually base everything presented on peer-reviewed, published research) as well as the time teaching the class itself. 

First question: how do I set a price point for the class? I've not seen much in the community done this way, so I don't really have a comparison point. All day seminars I've seen in the $500-950 range per person, but those were done by folks who are a bit further along in their community reputation than I and are in a different topic area. 

2nd, how do I suggest a benefit for the physicians' office? Granted, they get to say that they are providing educational and prevention services for their clients, but that's not enough, I think. One person I spoke with suggested 15% of the gross.

We know there is a market for it in Canada, and his current employer would be okay with us trying to do the same thing there. We just wonder if there is anybody around that has been through the process and give us a realistic idea of what to expect.

We are unsure if it would be better to move to Canada and operate the business and possibly become citizens, or if we can/should just setup the business in Canada and spend 6-8 months travelling around Canada doing the Refurbishment, while continuing to Live in the US. 

Materials are easily found and can be purchased in Canada, so we wouldn't need to import anything. 

We would travel over the whole of Canada as the real estate is spread across the entire nation. So if it's anything like the US we would likely need to deal with local licensing for each city/province?

We are currently studying the requirements, but just wonder if anybody does business in or relocated to Canada and can offer some advice!

 I've been looking at Godaddy recently and it seems to have everything I'm looking for. A website design tool (good for someone like me who can't build one myself the traditional way or afford to pay someone to), web store for people to purchase my services with a credit/debit card, and various other tools. Just seems pretty simple and straightforward to me. Which is what I want.

I've learned a lot since i'm there, specially in Human Resources since internal problems were kind of my first challenge(still being taken care of, but already fired 2 employees for stealing).

My customers value quality but value price way harder, so should i bet in quality with some more expensive processes or try just to cut the costs and try to produce more and more?

My customers are other small business and restaurants, for a cheaper price, and in the shop, mainly older people 50-65 but is a bit massified so we get around 500 daily visits from all age and personality ranges.

I don't have a good branding yet, trying to rebrand the business using the former business name, my family name, that was selled to other guy. In a fresher way using a bit of classical elements but kind of hipster styling it.

Internal problems such as stealing, bad staff, bad habits are still being taken care of, but we had some legal problems in the past with employees and we are allways afraid of firing.

We have bread and pastry and i would like to know the best way to show it.

And if other people have similiar business i would like to have some help by links or restaurants.

Personal problems:

-I did not hire that staff
-The strategy was not mine
-The clients were not acquired by me
-It's not a cash problem is more of puting my Marketing vision and try to turn the place into a big business and building a big brand.

So far my managing strategy towards employees is a positive approach, trying to be as transparent and friendly as possible, but showing i can get upset and allways notice the failure, as well as hating(getting extremely pissed) about losing money by any means.

I am talking about retail table-top games with rent by the hour video game play.

Here locally there was a business that did just the video games.  A customer would walk in, pay for whatever amount of time they wanted to play, sit in front of any one of the ten 55"" flat screens with an xbox, or any of the 20 PCs.  They would tell the worker what game they want, and start playing.  At the end of their time, the software would automatically log them out and they would be done.

I really liked this idea.  There are some items that I would do differently than what my friend did.  The largest of them being room for table-top games.  Games like [Magic: the Gathering](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Default.aspx).  Board games like [Cosmic Encounters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_Encounter).  Maybe even large group games like [Ultimate Werewolf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Werewolf).  Having Friday Night Magic for the Magic players, and board game nights on Sat and Sun nights, would help with the slow times on the video game side.

The cost of replacing consoles and games can get unreal.  Replacing games, as in needing to keep the newest/coolest games on the shelf would get really expensive at $60 each.  On the tabletop side, there isn't much worry beside how to get in touch with a distributor.  

Where do I go to get funding for something like this?  How do I build a business plan?  Has anybody owned one of these kinds of businesses and could give me some advice on what worked really well, and what didn't? Where does a Magic: the Gathering business hold up online with the constant flux of card prices?  I have a plan to start out small and funded on my own.  I figure I could rent out an office that would allow me to put internet in.  Have enough space to put up folding tables, and comfy chairs.  Then just put up Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights to start.  I and my fiance both work Monday-Friday 9-5, so doing this small and on the weekends would not interfere with our ""bills paying"" jobs.  Do you have a better idea on how to get started without throwing myself from my job into it?

Getting financing should not be a problem, but I have never done that.  Where do I go for financing?  Is there a town hall meeting that I can stand up and present?  Do I just call local businesses and ask who they got to finance them?  I don't really want to fly to NY or LA for $120,000 financing.

Thanks for the advice in advance.

**EDIT**

***TL;DR*** I want to open a game store that incorporates video games, card games, board games, and miniature games.  Think [this](http://www.clockworkgaming.com/home.php) place.  How can I get started?  I know I need a business plan if I want financing, but what are your recommendations?  Best way to get equipment, stay licensed when needed, continue to offer newest games, and still keep an open, friendly, fun environment that is not too ""retail-ish"".

Additionally, I had a thought about accepting donations for a local charity. Is it possible to do this through the site, ideally through an added amount to the product total? Since I'm not a nonprofit would it need to be taxed? What reporting/filings would I need to take care of if I do this.

The way we operate now is our salespeople have bulky catalogs they take into the field, they write down the orders and fax or email them to the sales manager who inputs them into QB.

- catalogs on the iPads synced from a central server
- sales orders entered via iPads 
- each sales person maintains their own customer lists
- all synced with a central system that handles inventory and accounting.

I make masks and costumes with my partner. I've been doing this for about 12 years now, and I've never had this situation come up before, so I guess there's a first time for everything, or I've just been incredibly lucky.


On May 8th we had a customer from a theatre in Monarch Beach, California place a large order worth roughly $2150 CAD.


They said they couldn't pay it all at once and wanted to do payments.  I requested a deposit of $700 CAD.
We received a deposit of $500 CAD on May 29th.


We shipped the order on June 5th. They received it June 7th along with an invoice we sent for the remaining amount due.

They acknowledged receiving the costume items and have used them. The show is now over, so here's the crappy part.  I cannot get a hold of them...


Along with that invoice sent on June 7th, we requested that they pay $850 in 30 days and the remaining $800 in 60 days since they requested it to be done in payments.

30 days has passed and we've not received a payment.


We have called and left voice messages last week to remind of them of the upcoming due date. We've left voice messages this week asking for them to contact us to work out a payment.  We have not received a response. We've sent emails to the owner (the person we've been working with), the co-owner and treasurer.


The phone number for the owner usually rings several times and goes to voice mail.  The phone number for the theatre's main line from their site likely has a full mailbox since it rings and then asks for a security code... 


We've sent a payment request via PayPal for the $850 to the same email address we've received the deposit from.


I'll likely give them a few more days, or even this week, but I'm not holding my breath that they'll come through based on the silence. It's been discouraging since we worked our butts off to make everything for them, gave them a discount, airbrushed 70+ pieces, we even provided some free airbrushing on pieces...


So should they not come through this week, I'm unsure what we should do.

Should we continue to wait?  Should we start posting their info and non-payment status to various theatre forums, there are some large ones out there, we can post about them on MTI Showspace (licensing company for most theatrical shows).  I can also give their info to various other costume shops we work with.   I don't know if anything in the legal route would work because of the whole international thing,  travelling isn't worthwhile when it'll cost more to travel than the debt owing.

It has been approved by both the SBA and the Small Business Development Center here in San Francisco. Heres the hard part - getting financing for a startup with no proof of revenue past my sales projections. I have about 50k on hand, and Im going to need another 210k on top of that. I have good credit (over 700) but I have no collateral. My in-laws are talking about helping cover just the collateral, but I have a strong feeling that when push comes to shove theyre going to balk on me. So here are my questions - 


1 - Is there any other way to finance a business other than the regular route of begging banks or selling half my concept to venture capitalists? Ive heard words like ""crowdfunding"", but Im not sure how it works or where to go with it. It also seems like it would be a better option for smaller amounts, is my financial need (aprox $210,000) within reason for this option?


2 - Is there any way to get around my lack of collateral if nothing else works out and Im forced to go traditional? Right now they want more value in collateral than what theyre going to loan me (1:1.3), if I had something worth that much I could sell it and skip financing altogether. Im losing sleep over the catch-22 that the only people that are eligible to get loans are people that dont need it.

3 - My financial need is based off of my high end projections, I could actually get my business off the ground for about 80k less. How lean can I cut my budget and still be safe?

4 - Any other general advice is gold to me, and greatly appreciated.

(Avid redditor and long time member of the /r/smallbusiness subreddit posting with a throwaway)

1311692802.0,7,self.smallbusiness,j07fc,Business Opportunity: Should I go for it?,WhatDoYou_Think,7,0,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/j07fc/business_opportunity_should_i_go_for_it/,"I have an opportunity on the table right now and I'm struggling with what I need to do and if it's even worth my time. I created a throw away account for anonymity and all that, but here's as much details as I can share that I think is relevant. I'm looking for advice (even if it's not the positive kind).

The company I work for is working on selling off what I perceive the most financially stable and profitable portion of it's business. The company I work for has been in business over 33 years and changed ownership 18 months ago. The new owner is wanting to try and revive a failing section of the business and is planning to use this transaction to try and breathe new life into this piece of the business. My personal opinion is he'll be throwing his money into a moneypit and is making a bad business decision, since this portion of the company hasn't been profitable for over 5 years. 

In any case, the product in question is essentially a software application that provides research data to a very specific market. It is one that has been up and independantly profitable for over 20 years. It has an established and recurring revenue base with an extremely low attrition rate. If I would pursue it, I would be entering into it as a joint venture purchase with my father in law. My father in law works for the same company as me (he's been here 15 years, I've been here 11 years). *MY* reason for including him in this transaction is he's the one that redeveloped this product and he is the most knowledgable about how it works under the hood. What I would bring to the table is supporting the environment from outside of the software application world and pushing on more modern forms of delivery and pursuing possible new markets. All that being said, between my father in law and myself, we have all the knowledge necesarry to keep the system running.

My father in law profile: 60+ years old and owned a business before. His business was successful in its time, but it's been at least 20 years since he was there.

Me: Mid 30's. I've been at the company I'm at now since getting out of college and I have a Master's degree. While I have a very good credit score, I have a higher debt to income ratio than I would like. I have a wife (non-working) and 2 kids. I live a comfortable but not extravagant lifestyle. Even in this economy, I have some skills and background that make it relatively easy for me to find new employment if things go south.

One of the nice things about the possibility of purchasing this business is that I would not need to quit the job I'm working at now. It's very low maintenance and the parts of it that require regular business hours worked can be paid for with service contracts back to my existing employer as part of the negotiation would be an agreement for this work with my existing employer. It would be easy for me, if I were to have to spend time on supporting this business during my normal job, to work more time for my employer to make up for any lost productivity.

Some numbers:
Annual GROSS revenue: ~ $400,000
Annual expenses: ~ $150,000

Asking price: $1,000,000, but the owner is willing to consider $500,000 up front and the remaining sum to be paid over the course of some period of time (~3 years? I don't know yet)

I know the owner has an offer on the table, although I don't yet know the details. I don't know how long I would have before the money would need to be lined up.

I *DO NOT* have these funds, so I would be seeking a small business loan. I have no idea how long this will take nor do I have a feel for how likely we would be to get it.

My father in law and I have not discussed exactly what type of organization we would be. I'm leaning towards an LLC, but it's definitely something I would seek outside input on.

Although it is an established business, we are working on putting together the business plan that would include possible avenues into additional market areas. I will also be discussing getting the P&amp;L for this portion of the business with the current owner and clarifying his expectations on the term of a deal and how much time we would have to put an offer on the table.

So, reddit, give me your worst. Is there some more information you want to ask? Is this opportunity worth having a few sleepless nights over trying to get something put together or is this not worth my time trying to pursue?

I have a short list of clients, some of which are very loyal, and others that need encouragement every month to pay their bill. I need more, larger clients (&gt;$1000/mo) to support my business. Most of my clients are between the $150 and $450/mo range, and I find this is not a profitable size client. I love these businesses, don't get me wrong.

What would you have done?,josiee,9,3,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1gd8fr/issuing_returnsstore_credit_what_would_you_have/,"Hi all. I am still pretty new to having my own business. I have a small clothing boutique and haven't had many issues with returns. I have my return policy posted on my counter and I staple a card stock print out of the return policy to every receipt. My return policy is pretty strict: Up to 3 business days with tags attached and original receipt for a full refund. Up to 7 days for exchanges/store credit. I know it's pretty strict but I was having a lot of troubles with a couple ladies that were taking advantage of my previous return policy.

  Today a girl and her friend came in. The customer wanted to return a skirt but she didn't have (lost) her receipt. She gave me her card so I could look it up. No problem, I use Square and just did a quick search, I asked her for a general date and she said ""within the last month"".. However, she bought the skirt on March 3rd. It also reeked of marijuana and was missing the belt. I told her because it's been over 3 months I could not issue a refund. They started to hassle me and ask for store credit, I told her per my policy you only have up to 7 days to be issued store credit. Then they ask for half the cost of the skirt in store credit. I  stayed firm. Her friend comes over and says ""that doesn't make sense. We are planning to buy something and we can just get half store credit toward the item and you can resell the skirt for full profit"". I told her I couldn't because it was missing the belt and they freaked out! Telling me it didn't come with a belt and she never received it. I told her it did, there are belt loops and I know all my products (my space is less than 200 sq ft.!) The friend puts all the items she was holding back and says ""Let's just go to another store!!"" and they storm out.

  Now I'm afraid they're going to write bad reviews and just trash my shop in general. I do have a Yelp page but there are only 2 reviews.. and I know how damaging bad reviews can be.  What would you have done in this situation? Can she call her credit card company to try and issue a charge back? And if she leaves a negative review on Yelp or Facebook should I publicly reply back with why she wasn't issued a refund or should I just leave it up/ignore it?",,False,self,t5_2qr34,False,,,True,t3_1gd8fr,http://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1gd8fr/issuing_returnsstore_credit_what_would_you_have/,

Recently I've wanted to grow this from something i'm doing on my own into a business. Numbers of reasons including wanting more security than having all my income from the basket of 1 or 2 clients. 

My question is, would I be better off setting this up as 1 business that does landscaping, painting, and cleaning, or should i separate these into 3 entities? I feel like in a networking sense it'd be easier to have all of my services combined, but on paper and in general advertising it looks unfocused to have such a broad range of services.

I've been mulling this over for a while now and have come up with the structure in terms of record-keeping, maintenance, suppliers, etc. The point that I could use some help on is how to actually go about charging for the items. The two ways I see it happening are:

(a) I buy the items, mark them up, and ""resell"" them as a package to the customer

(b) I bill the customer directly for the actual cost and instead have a flat fee for going out and finding the items for the customer.

With the latter, I have a feeling I would get have to deal with a lot less record-keeping and taxes. I won't be selling tangible goods, just a service (right?). Either way, I'm counting on the maintenance part being a component of the idea.

About a year or so ago I got lucky advertising and currently turn down a lot of clients everyday because I don’t have employees.  The business is under my name so it isn’t registered.  I was curious what to do and how to hire employees, 1-2.  I was also thinking about opening a business checking account because keeping track of everything with cash is too hard.  From what I understand I would need to register the business and apply for a TIN first.  I’ve spoken to my insurance agent about business insurance but the minimum liability they offer is much more than I need ($300k) and the premium was close to $2,000/year which would severely cut into my profit.  Is there a cheaper alternative out there? 

When I register my business should I register it as a sole-proprietorship?  My mother also owns a housekeeping business.  Would there be any benefits in going into a partnership with her?  Or would it just be more paperwork.  Finally what can I deduct from my taxes that I may not know about and is there a way for me to set myself up with health insurance, since I‘m self employed?

I am a couple of weeks away from opening my restaurant, and I would like to have a few words on marketing and promotions. I'd love to hear your ideas and past experiences.

Background story:

I'm a young IT \ Video Editor \ Animator (so I have a good+ understanding of digital tools) who fell in love and moved to a different continent and changed my career path. In the past 3 years I've been working on opening a food business ('Hummusiyah', a restaurant that specializes in production and sales of Hummus). It took me a year to get work permits, then for a year I was producing and delivering hummus and also had a hummus-van with which I worked in festivals etc. In the last six months I've been renting a restaurant on Saturdays and serving there hummus for lunch. So far I am getting extremely positive feedback from clients, many returns, and although my turnaround is tiny I think the product is good and has a spot in the local market, which is devoid of hummus (we mainly have here pizza, noodles, doener-shawarma and sausages [bonus points: guess where I am]).

Finally after a long search I've found a suitable place and hopefully I'll sign the lease on Friday. So far I've invested 10k Euro, and for fitting the place and paying all the deposits etc. I'll invest another 20k Euro.

The location I found is very central and is adjacent to a very frequented plaza (considered A1 class) but I'm getting it for cheap because the place will be demolished in 13 months and I'll have to leave. I need to use this time (and the coming summer especially) to build recognition and generate enough money to be able to get some loan to open the second, permanent place.

Marketing and promotions:

I have built a [website](http://www.thehummuscorner.com/) and have a [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Hummus-Corner/195632157139473) (which is getting less and less hits unless I pay them). 

I need to come up with ideas on how to promote my soon-to-open shop. 

* Flyers: Tried it once, saw very little to no reaction (the flyers had 20% discount on them).

* Having attractive young people handing out samples: People react positively and when distributed in the right time (a little before lunch) and in the area of my place, this got quite a few people to come and eat.

* I think of making small '1 Euro' notes that people could redeem (one per customer on opening week only not including drinks). This is basically a coupon, but maybe when people are handed 'money' they will feel like they shouldn't 'throw it away'.

* I will have a 'crowd stoppers' - one of these street signs that stand outside the shop with a poster describing what's in the shop.

* I consider producing (myself, can do) some type of video (showing the different dishes, people having fun eating them etc.) and have a flatscreen facing the window looping it.

We're of the opinion that, in the current political and economic climate, it's going to be difficult (if not impossible) to compete using the traditional monolithic business structure in the near future.

A single entity of the proper type can provide tax advantages, and certain protections (e.g. limited liability) under the law. This is fine for most very small businesses (say, under $1mm sales size).

But next time you're at Arby's, I'd encourage you to look at the paper tray liners. You'll notice that the trademark doesn't belong to Arby's Inc, but to a separate company. That entity owns all of Arby's IP, and licenses it back to another Arby's-owned entity (e.g. a management company). There are likely other entities serving various business purposes as well.

So why would they do this? Well, when you have multiple legal entities serving distinct business purposes in your organization, you open up a world of possibilities that didn't exist for you before. Your business becomes clay in the hands of a creative entrepreneur. 

You're able to enhance the balance sheets of one of your companies (all with absolutely audit-able transactions, serving verifiable business purposes) to make that entity an ideal candidate for lending or investment capital, where your previous single-entity business would have been denied for not meeting specific ratios or not falling into the right industrial categorization.

You can create rock-solid asset protection against litigation and regulatory expenses by creating isolation between your operating entities and those which hold assets.

You can maximize your tax advantages by structuring each entity to receive the maximum benefits available under the tax code. 

You will begin to recognize new income streams using existing resources and assets, as you start to optimize the operation of each entity (e.g. the company that holds your IP may begin licensing that IP to others for additional revenue, or your sales force begins forming joint ventures to cross-sell related products from other companies).

The possibilities are absolutely staggering when you start to see this structure unfold before you.

Now, here's the catch...there's a reason primarily only Fortune 500 companies did this before. It takes either a very, very savvy entrepreneur who can manage all of the added complexity in his head, or you need a team of pros who can do so on your behalf. You don't want to be on the wrong end of an audit because you did something stupid that you can't justify at the end of your tax year.

If this is something that interests anyone here, I'd be very happy to set up a live training with my mentor and partner, and we can explain the finer points of how all this works. This isn't a sales presentation. When you leave, you'll know exactly how multiple entity structuring works, and you'd be able to theoretically go implement it for yourself. It's going to be very educational in nature, and it's going to be free.

That said, in the interest of transparency, we will be demonstrating using a system we developed to help manage and minimize the complexity and financial overhead this sort of structuring creates. If you're interested, we can work with you to implement the strategies using our tools and support. But there's no pressure, and no obligation. We do think this is the best thing since sliced bread for business, and that's why we're willing to completely show our hand, because we think once you see how easy we make it, you'll trust us to help you implement it.

If you operate a business grossing at least $1mm, you can PM me to request a training. Again, this isn't a sales pitch...it's an offer for free education on a very powerful method for structuring your business. If you end up working with us to do it, that's just gravy, and we're happy to help.  I'd be happy to answer any questions I can here.",,False,self,t5_2qr34,False,,,True,t3_18awq0,http://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/18awq0/advanced_asset_protection_using_multiple_business/,

For a 10x20 space, add $175, 20x20 just double it. Per month.

Several questions.,robobug,10,2,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/17twzc/potentially_buying_a_restaurant_several_questions/,"1.  Should I set up an LLC or run it as a sole proprietor?  Seems like there could be a fair bit of liability if my food made someone sick.

2.  What am I really buying if the place is not currently operating.  Just the existing lease (about 6.5 years left on it) and the equipment and signage?

3.  If the location is great in a general sense but not great in a more specific sense, should I run away?  To clarify this point, it is on a great street, very busy commuter traffic in the evening which would be good for take out (small interior so this would be a focus) but, it is at a weird intersection and sits on a triangular lot that can be awkward to navigate.  Am I being falsely sold on location here? 

4.  How much does a lighted custom plastic sign cost?  I hate the existing name but it looks like they sunk some real money into the sign.  It is multi colored, about 3 inches deep and 4 words in at least 2 font sizes.  I'd say its about a foot tall and 8-9 feet long.  I don't want to be paying for something that holds no value to me.


The price seems too good to be true (it has dropped by almost half since I first contacted the business broker) but after thinking about it, since it has shut down, i'm no longer buying an operating business.  I suppose I should go through the inventory and price it out to see how much gear is really there.



**reasons I think this place could work:**

A. tons of commuter traffic and I have a friend in the area who always complains about the lack of quality take out on that route.  This place's food and name are what I think was sinking it more than anything.

B.  I grew up eating arguably the best take out burgers in the country and I have been working at home to duplicate it for years and I feel i'm getting close.

C.  With a simplified menu and faster turnaround times, I think there are a lot of savings to be had here.  I can only operate from the reviews and the old menu but it seems like they tried to spread themselves too thin (who wants frozen breaded salmon to be deep fried by their burger place?)  If I focused the menu on burgers only (maybe a veggie burger too because PNW) and did away with a ""seafood menu"" and all that deep fried garbage (except fries and maybe onion rings if I can ever get them to turn out how I like) I feel like I could produce a product that is superior to everything within at least 5 miles.  

D. not using a shitty, gimicky name that has well past its prime for being clever and marketable I think more people in my reasonably pretentious city would give me a chance to wow them with a burger that is better than anything else around*.


*this isn't as much of a brag on my burger making as it is on the lack of good burgers in the area

Great time! My full set of notes are front page of www.StartupBros.com but here are some of my favorite pieces:
______
Start a business – not a startup. The goal is profit.  Know how you will become profitable from the start.

 Decisions are progress. So say “let’s decide on it” instead of “let’s think about it.”

 Focus on things that stay constant. Like peoples’ desires.  Focus on ease of use, speed, things people will want in ten years as much as they do now.

Always sell the byproduct.  Rework is the byproduct of 37 Signal’s blog.  If you are spending time becoming an expert at something, you should be writing about it.  If you are doing something kickass (an epic bike ride, training program, or music tour) you should be documenting it.

Should I register a company credit card using my home address? 
Should I open a bank account in the name of the business, or use my own?

What are some draw backs of not owning an office space?

My business revolves around an app I developed called Drive Alive, which rewards drivers for NOT using their cell phone while driving.  

In order to sustain this incentive program, I am attempting to get businesses to participate in my businesses affiliate program.  

The affiliate program works like this:

Businesses offer rewards related to their business to my app users and in exchange get the great PR of helping my business (Drive Alive, LLC) stop texting while driving, get free advertising through our site / social media pages, and get to email/text blast to our app users who indicated they want to receive messages from our affiliates. 

I am looking to see if any Small business owners who read this forum would like to participate, and for tips on how to find affiliates.  

Things I am currently trying:

-  Direct messaging businesses who follow me on twitter.

-  Connecting with business owners on Linked in and asking them to affiliate.  

That's about it so far.  I have found my 6 current affiliates that way.

Here is the link to the full explanation of my app and affiliate program.  http://drivealiveapp.com/tl/affiliates.php

Things I am planning to do:

-  Join my local chamber of commerce and attend business owner meetups in my area

-  Go door to door to local businesses and sell the idea to them.  

Any other ideas guys?  Thanks.

We both have day jobs and I just recently got married and bought a house.  Everyone we have shown our product to loves it!  The issue is that neither of us have a lot of money to put into it.  At what point do we decide, ""hey, let's take out a small business loan"" or something like that?  I guess it's just a risk that we're going to have to be willing to take?  Or is there another option...a cheaper one.

Also, on another note, I'd like to hire a salesperson to help get my product more exposure in other places.  I think that hiring a salesperson in that area and paying them commission would be more fiscally responsible than us traveling around to different areas.  I just have no idea about sales and what to look for/what do avoid in hiring one.

It turns out I can.  So now, looking at it, I think I can make a decent chunk of money doing this part time in addition to my day job.

I've been reading online about how to setup a new business but it's all very confusing.  From what I gather, as a single person doing a business with no partners or investors with no plans to take on any debt or loans, I'm best off registering as an LLC. So I've gotten that far.

But then I was reading things about how an LLC can choose to be taxed as an S-Corp in order to avoid certain franchise fees and get more options to reduce taxes, but in exchange for that is more paperwork (like issuing stock, having board meetings and minutes requirements... with myself)?  I was reading something about giving myself a small salary and then paying out a yearly (quarterly? biannual?) dividend bonus or something called a distribution which can be used for tax savings due to differences in how it gets classified?  If I did this, I would essentially be locking myself out of having personal access to this additional money until I choose to award it to myself?

I'm very confused.  Is there a simple place to go that lays out options and legalities and best practices for this type of stuff?

I have a question regarding equity compensation as a form of payment for work provided.  I am handling the technical aspects of a small business that is starting to gain some momentum.  I have handled the entirety of our website and e-commerce solution as well as doing some certification filing and things like that.  

This is not a huge contribution to the business, but it is by no means insignificant.  This has allowed us to not hire a web developer and get a fully tailored, customized online presence.  Also, a huge majority of our presence is due to online visits to the page and online sales.

I currently have 1% of the shares.  How significant is this in the grand scheme of a business?  Is this sizeable, would you give more/less or something else?

I have started a new web development business, and - as some of you may know - it's a competitive market. My relatively young freelance business is focused on developing sites for small/medium-sized companies at very competitive prices.

I need to get my name out there and need some advice. I'm not advertising here don't worry, I just need your help. I had the idea of getting business cards printed (sitting next to me now) and handing them to local businesses. The thing is, I need a way of being able to succinctly say what I do and offer my services. Something along the lines of:

""I am new to the area and offer web design and IT services. Here is my card if you ever need such services in the future"".

Unfortunately, after a days worth of thinking, that is the best I can come up with. Even I can see it comes off as a bit out of the blue, a bit arrogant possibly, and most importantly - if they designed their own site - it may come off as insulting.

I have done my research, and I believe I really can improve a lot of companies sites in my area. I can also offer great value for money for static sites (which most small-sized businesses need from experience).

What I'm after is a way to approach someone out of the blue, get my name across and let them know what I do and how I can help them. Hopefully there are some helpful people (and even some small business owners) who can offer their advice on this.

1331256922.0,7,self.smallbusiness,qo7r7,Successful Small Family Owned Business with 40 year history having trouble growing (canada),actasifyouare,9,2,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/qo7r7/successful_small_family_owned_business_with_40/,"I am the second generation of the family to be working in our business. I came into it five years ago after wasting a pile of money going to university for a degree that went nowhere. 

My father started this business in 1971. He has been through it all and has managed quite successfully to provide a good life (by no means rolling in dough but good) Aside from a hickup in the 1980's when interest rates went through the roof (akin to buying a property on your visa card) we have weathered most storms and swings.  

In 2006 I came into the business. We are a retail and wholesale operation that works in high end high quality european outdoor gear and lifestyle clothing. Being a younger generation I have always pushed for modernization, digitization, internet sales etc. Naturally my father being of the old guard is resistant to change but in the last two years we really have changed our image and direction and it is proving to be rather successful. We have seen growth in years of severe economic turmoil worldwide and have built a solid business that has been steadily growing. 

The Canadian Outdoor equipment market is one that is very unique and slanted to favor the big players. There are now only two very large players (namely Mountain Equipment Co-op and Canadian Tire which recently acquired the Forzani Group - see Sport Check, Atmosphere, Sport Mart etc  etc etc). We as a small shop are in a unique position. My father has built relationships over the years with our suppliers giving us exclusive rights to a very sought after brand and we have another brand that is just beginning a meteoric rise in the North American Market that is supporting us fully with inventory/marketing etc. We plan on opening and expanding with more of our own shops as well as branded shops with this brand. Both brands these the owners are like extended family so we are very lucky in that sense. 

Now here lies our problem. We are hitting a glass ceiling when it comes to financing. Year over year we put up solid numbers but our financing has not increased by our primary lender in close to ten years. They have no interest in changing anything unless we show them assets (aka a house etc) or put cash into the bank. Now why would I put cash into the bank to pay to use my own money? We bank with one of the big banks in Canada and of course that has shown little to no help or interest in working us to fund any sort of growth. They have suggested going to an advance company where we sell X amount of our credit card transactions to them. This is of course expensive money but if you take it over the life of a loan it really would be pretty close to a 4-5 year loan in terms of interest expenses. This did help us but again it is only a band-aid that keeps us away from getting to the rolling income that would fund our growth.

As our main product line from europe is imported directly cash is king. Our supplier has worked with us on reasonable terms but getting in a big enough order and ensuring turnover is quick enough has really held us back. We both have strong sales with Government/Law Enforcement agencies as well as a strong following across Canada and the USA with everyday consumers. We figure that due to our lack of funding at present we see $20-40000 worth of revenue walk out of the door every single month. Add in we have anywhere from 80-100k worth of sales on backorder at any given time.   

What I am looking for is advice on getting funding to grow. The revenue and opportunity is there. The potential for growth is almost limitless and the foundation is solid. It's like looking through a glass ceiling and it is getting frustrating. I am interested in advice on seeking funding and/or non-traditional methods of funding. Ideally we would be looking for 100-150k of additional funding. As of right now we do $900k in sales at retail and about $200k at wholesale. We typically run about 40% GP and with our new product range it is getting closer to 45+% (can be as high as 50% some months depending on the clothing/footwear ratio)

The TLDR

-40 year old family company about to be taken over by second gen.
-Good following and sales across the continent from single location
-potential for growth limitless due to exclusivity of lines and support from manufacturers
-looking for financing since banks typically are not interested
-looking for 100-150k in additional financing
-loosing 20-40k in sales per month due to insufficient supply that is limited by financing/cashflow
-typically have 80-100k retail in sales on backorder again due to supply issues
-Revenues sit at ~$1.1 million
-looking for non-traditional means of financing since big banks won't help

Any advice or input is greatly appreciated! It really is a great business that focuses on good quality long lasting product that uses a lot of sustainable materials and the following is amazing and our support from our customers is second to none.

I guess the question is, do you use Square and how did you integrate it with your standard register?

We already own a successful business, just want to open another, we have good credit, and the current business has no debt, and positive cash flow every month.

I found out today we were turned down on the loan because we weren't putting up enough equity. I told them we needed 60k to open, we were putting up 10k, and wanting to borrow 50k. I've search google for what kind of % they were looking for, but I can't find anything. If I want 50k, how much should I tell them I'm willing to put into it? The thing is, I just want to get the loan to get started, and reserve my cash to keep it running if it's not as profitable as I expect.

Here's my situation, minus any details I think might give away where I work:

* My boss has been running this store for about 35 years. He owns the building and business, but plans to retire this winter and just be a landlord for whoever takes over.
* The store has somewhat of a ""niche"" focus (with several social minority groups) and for that reason has a very important historical and cultural place in ""the community""--people love this place because of that and want to support us.
* The store was once profitable, but started losing money roughly ten years ago, and is currently losing a LOT of money every single year. The owner has been funding these losses out of pocket to keep it going for about 10 years now.
* I am more than capable of turning this business around. Besides having tons of relevant prior experience (and I should mention I've been working here for about a year), I have the capacity to upgrade most of the systems and internal procedures that have not been changed in 20 years (this store seriously runs on a computer system last updated in 1994, it even has a floppy disk drive, and their entire database is stored on a magnetic tape cartridge. Yeah, it's that outdated).

I have already approached him and explained that while I do not have the financial resources to purchase the store, I am more than capable and willing at my current measly pay-rate to take over and transform this into a once again profitable business. I've begun writing all of my ideas out in a more formal business proposal in my free time, but approached him initially to gauge whether it's even worth completing to present to him.

While he initially seemed receptive, I ran up against resistance to EVERY idea I presented, even updating the ancient computer system. He is absolutely convinced that this database software (last updated before computers came with modems) is top-of-the-line because it was specifically created for this particular type of business. Even when I explained to him that it could be easily replicated with modern database software, not to mention improved, he would not budge. 

The problem is this store WILL close if things don't change, but at this point his idea of change is ""we'll get some new furniture"". So my problem/request is: how do I approach him in a way that recognizes and respects all of the work and sacrifice he's put in over the past 35 years, but still gets him to see that things MUST change if the store is to survive and that he has to let someone else who understands how to run a business in 2013 make those changes?

**TL;DR - Owner has been running store since 70s that was once booming but now failing. It WILL fail if things don't change, but he refuses to even consider updating or changing any of the LONG outdated equipment or internal practices, despite the fact that he wants to retire this year and sell the business to someone else. How do I approach him in a way that is respectful of all his hard work and sacrifice, but still gets him to see that he needs to let someone who knows what they are doing take over and change the many problematic/inefficient/outdated/etc. aspects of the business?**",,False,self,t5_2qr34,1376599792.0,,,True,t3_1kfyhl,http://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1kfyhl/seeking_advice_how_do_you_convince_someone_whos/,

I don't have a background in business, but I'm a decently intelligent fellow and most of what I've read about and planned for seems pretty straightforward, but the one aspect of the business that I don't yet understand in a practical sense is excise taxes and bonded storage.

If I understand what I've read so far, an excise tax is paid (or put up in bond?) by the manufacturer (the winery) when the product is removed from the ""warehouse"" before it is sold, then included in the price, a tax hidden from the consumer.

And I think that a bonded warehouse, for my purposes, is a storage facility kept under lock and key, at which detailed records of the comings and goings of wine are kept. I have to pay the excise tax when I remove the wine.

In summary:

* Is  the above sufficient? 

* Who do I pay? How do I pay? Am I right about when I pay? Can I pay on credit?

* At a small scale (one building) do I have to have a separate area or room that is my ""bonded warehouse"" or is the backroom fine?

* When do I have to store the wine? As soon as it is bottled? When I deem it ready to sell (after x months bottle aging)? Before it goes to the tasting room/sales floor?

2.

  The person hasn't done anything with the website at all, and based on the WhoIs lookup, might just be holding this for a hobby or some potential future use.

I need advice on the order of execution. 

I have 10,000 to work with, as well as the ability to trade my car (worth about 9,000) for a pickup truck.

I have been writing down some of my needs which include:

A new larger stump grinder (10,000 range used, 20,000 range used)

Business cards/advertising

LLC/insurance 

Truck and trailer (again, can borrow for time being)

Misc smaller needs.

So what should I do first? Tomorrow I could go out and grind stumps and start making money, promote my business, then buy the larger grinder opening me up to larger jobs, then getting the LLC and business end in order. 

Or should I get all my ducks in a row, Open a business account at a bank, file for the LLC, buy a stump grinder and truck, advertise and then do jobs?

The sub questions with that are if I buy a stump grinder, not in the name of the business, can I still write if off as an expense later when I incorporate?

Any and all advice would be a great help!

So I've been running a small french patisserie/cafe for about 5 years now and it's been very difficult work (working 12-14 hour shifts). My prior experience was in the labour force, but due to continuous work injuries and company's financial well being, I was laid off. Thus I made the decision to buy a business to support my family. As I had purchased the business, it already had roots in the area and was sort of established. I gave it a complete renovation and organised it much more efficiently (the prior owners did not manage their logistics well) - I had been running it since. (I have no pastry experience, I have merely been trained to bake goods). I'm turning to you guys to seek some advice on ways I can perhaps push my business forward. I'd like to turn it into an attraction in my city - a place ""people have to visit"" if in the vicinity and sort of engrave it into the heritage of the city. I'm just wondering how I can perhaps gain some PR and also significantly increase the long term revenue of the business.

I'm looking to create some customer loyalty cards very soon as a first step, where after 5 coffees for e.g. a customer can grab a croissant/coffee for free.


Any ideas and help would be greatly appreciated, I just want to bring it to the next level and also counter the competition that has been increasing in numbers of the past years.

Perhaps /r/smallbusiness might be more appropriate.

I run a small web development and management company. ([Link to our site](http://anothercoffee.net) if anyone is curious.) It's basically a one-man-band with some work handed off to a small group of trusted freelancers. Most of the work comes through word-of-mouth referrals and this has been good enough to help us run for more than seven years.

However, one thing I've never been able to fully resolve is the typical 'feast-or-famine' workload; either there's huge amounts of work that comes in all at once or things quiet down for a while. Subcontracting work to close associates helps with the feasts and ongoing site maintenance (and enough cash in the bank) helps with cashflow during the famine.

I've tried pay-per-lead services in order to help with getting a constant pipeline of work (specifically, [The Seed](http://www.theseed.com) and a few freelance sales people). None have been particularly successful in generating quality leads so I've always ended up looking for business myself.

So a few questions:

1. Can anyone recommend good pay-per-lead services for this industry? (My company is based in the UK but any country would be fine.)

2. Are pay-per-lead services just the wrong approach for this business?

3. What ways of generating business have you tried that have worked well?

I've been looking to buy a Subway franchise for about two years. One of my former co-workers owned one and it seemed like something I'd really enjoy and do well in.

I've come across a few on business selling websites. They have notes on financing as 'Seller will consider financing' and other vague terms like that. Does this mean that the seller would finance to me himself? How does this sort of thing usually work?

Hey everyone, I've owned a virtual business selling software via the App Store for 9 months and I'm ready to personally draw a paycheck from it and also ready to pay a contractor.  I'm setting up payroll with Intuit online payroll (considered ADP, SurePayroll, and Paychex and ultimately decided on Intuit), and I'm not sure which state I should file my employment related taxes with, as the company is purely virtual and legally somewhat complicated.

**Background**
When starting the LLC, it was likely that I'd be moving between states frequently (every 1 to 2 years) for the foreseeable future, and I have been, so here's how it stands now:

I am the sole member of a Wyoming LLC, which uses a registered agent service with a physical address in that state as required for serving of process purposes.  Since I move frequently, I wanted to avoid using my address at the time for any of the official company registration.  My parents are retired and don't intend on moving, so I established my parents' address in Kansas as both the Mailing Address and Principal Office Address with the Wyoming Secretary of State.  The Kansas address is also the address filed with the IRS for the company's EIN.

I now live in Oregon, and in practice use an Oregon PO Box as the mailing address of the company for any non IRS-related communication (magazines, contracts, etc.) so that I can actually retrieve the mail.  I intend in the future to pay contractors in various states, perhaps even countries.  Within months, I intend to pay a contractor in Washington.

**Recap**
So, to recap the circus:  Wyoming LLC, filing address in Kansas, mailing address in Oregon, employee in Oregon, contractor in Washington.  Whew!

**Conundrum**
So the question Intuit asks is: *""Where is your office located?""*  Intuit uses this answer to determine which state I pay employment taxes to, but I'm not sure.  I haven't filed for any state related permits, designations, or any other registrations other than my Wyoming LLC Articles of Organization.  All of my sales are through the Apple App Store and similar distributors who handle all of the payments, taxes, and processing for me.  

If I enter in the Kansas address, Intuit wants my Kansas Withholding Tax Account Number, but it doesn't seem like I should be paying Kansas State taxes since no business activity actually takes place in Kansas, and the business isn't registered there either.  I don't think it should be Oregon either since I'll pay Oregon income taxes as an employee living here, but the company has no official presence in Oregon either, other than having an employee (myself) who works from Oregon.  I think this will be the same case for my contractor: as far as I can tell I don't need to pay state employer taxes to Washington in order to hire a contractor there.  

My best guess is that I should list the Wyoming address and pay unemployment, worker's comp, etc. taxes to Wyoming, since that's where the LLC is registered, but I'm still not sure.

I'm sure I'll likely have to consult a lawyer and/or accountant about this, but I'm first wondering if anyone has guidance on this situation.  Each secretary of state website for the states in question lacks guidance for virtual businesses, so I'm unclear on what to do.  Any help or anecdotes from business owners in similar situations is greatly appreciated.

I was employed by an onsite computer repair business for two years before it shut down. I took my experience and started my own LLC and so far I am happy to say that things are going well. I'm still in college studying Biology and the work is just right for me at this point of my life. 

Unfortunately I run into a reoccurring problem. Clients will regularly call me back asking me to troubleshoot small issues with their computers after I am finished with a job. Don't get me wrong, I have no problem helping someone like this occasionally, but I feel like some clients are taking advantage of my kindness and causing me to lose potential work. In addition to this, many of them take the opinion that my work was poor because a new issue has developed.

The main way I am going to get more clients is through word of mouth, so it is important that I am kind and accessible. How do I kindly make it clear that I cannot work for free? How do I also explain how I am not necessarily at fault for new issues?

my early shift ends at 2pm and starts again at 5pm every weekday (sometimes as early as 45min before 5pm, depending on whether or not my employer has deliveries).

hearing the rants from my co-worker, and also having been in the same situation (didn't have my own car until after i graduated), i can understand and possibly have a way to alleviate other students who can be faced with this on the random occasion.

what i'm proposing to do is offer a student taxi service, upon appointment (fliers in the school itself) giving students an opportunity to get a ride home when things turn sour by the end of the day.

now, at this point i'm working on my own, and driving a car that can seat 7 others. i pay all the car insurance, vehicle emissions are up-to-date as of a week ago, i get regular tune-ups and am looking at a flat-rate fee of $5 per person to service a roughly 12-square mile area. i currently have no intention of this venture growing beyond what i can do by myself (hiring other drivers, covering more than 1 school).

i researched this type of operation on google and in this subreddit (being, single driver, flat fee, part-time) and found very little regarding this type of situation. i'm asking and inviting other small business owners about the possible inhibitions i may face in the future. most of what i looked up had to do with longer distances and having a meter in the car, but i charge a flat fee.

any and all ideas, thoughts, and/or criticisms are welcome and appreciated.

How can I prepare before he gets here and what steps should we take?,ColonCatastrophe,12,9,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/17som3/moving_my_father_to_california_this_spring_to/,"Hello all! So, a little background first. My father has been working on cars since roughly 1975. He bought his first Chevelle when he was 14, and fixed it up by taking classes and getting information from people he was around. He worked all around the city he grew up in until 1999 doing body work and restoring cars, at which time we moved to a small town. It took a year, but after that, he became the body shop manager for the Ford dealership of the town we lived in, making a good amount of money. The owner sold the business to a family who had another Ford dealership in another town, and by 2008, he went from body shop manager to body technician to detailer to janitor/snow shoveler. In 2006, we began doing cars out of our garage to make ends meet and pay bills. He was laid off just before Christmas in 2010, and we lost our house. He moved back to live with his brother, and I moved out to California on a whim with no job, no place to live, and two bags of possessions.

I am now doing well off, and he... Not so much. The midwestern weather is doing it's worst to him, and he needs out. I can tell you unbiasedly, his work was beyond what others were putting out, plain and simple. He gets calls from the dealership that laid him off for him to go back, but he refuses to move back and be put in a bad situation again.

So, here is where things become tricky. I currently live with my girlfriend, and we are going to move to what most likely will be a duplex. We need a garage, which is one of the only stipulations we have, so my dad can begin doing a few cars to get some money on the table. Are there any legal obligations that would put us at risk if he is making money out of a place we are renting out? At this point, renting a building is out of the question because we really don't have the funds, and both his and my credit are both, to put it bluntly, terrible. I have past medical bills that I cannot pay because insurance. He lost our house so he isn't in the best light either (and the sad thing is the bank tore down the house, so I won't ever be able to visit it again...)

I started creating a lite website at this point just to get some information. Being from Wisconsin, our rates were drastically lower than what they charge in California, so that will help us out a bit too. I know that once we get a steady flow of people, they will continue to come back. Our full detail offers services that others either charge extra for or completely avoid (degreasing the engine, cleaning out the wheel-wells, vacuuming the trunk, etc.) 


What I am really asking at this point, are these few things:

1. Will we be able to work out of the house/duplex we are renting, or will we be screwed over by that?

2. I currently have one part-time job, but will be taking on another job within two months to help pay his way out here, and am signing up for school in the fall. I also continue to sell the items I have purchased since I moved here to raise more money for him. Are there any other things I can do to help speed up the process? He currently works a few days a week shoveling snow or cutting tree limbs, but once the snow melts and it gets to ~50 degrees daily, he will be able to do a car or two a week to supplement his income.

3. What tips do you guys have to prepare things for his arrival? I will be making a Facebook page to stir up some chatter, will post on the local sub-Reddit, and I will be talking to friends and hopefully friends of friends to get the word of mouth out there. 

4. If things did pick up quickly and I had to work with him full time while going to school, how would we go about getting the business fully up to par? 


Thank you so much, and any and all help is very much needed! I love my dad more than anybody else, and for two and a half decades I had to see him bust his ass to make other people rich.

They've moved into a spot that already had a reputation, so business is doing quite well for a place that hasn't even had its grand opening.

However, my parents have always had...marital issues, per se. We bear some of the stereotypical Asian family traits -- lack of communication and the like. And while their issues have always been more or less manageable over the years, starting this business has put their problems into a pressure cooker, and things are getting out of hand.

So I know the first recommendation is probably, ""Your parents need to fix their communication/marital issues."" I know this, but it's not something I can compel them to do, you know?

So the main business problem out of many: the general manager right now is the general manager of the restaurant that was there previously. My mother does NOT trust this woman at all. My father doesn't necessarily trust her that much either, but he does not want to get rid of her because neither of them have experience running a restaurant, and this woman is currently (barely) keeping things together.

My mother doesn't trust her for a variety of reasons, some unfounded and some with reason. There's suspicion that she's been pocketing money, and she is pushing for more and more control of the restaurant. My father isn't conceding (he thinks she's pushing too hard too), but my mother feels he's being played already. So of course, this all exacerbates the problems my parents had to begin with.

My question is -- how do we contain this manager? If she's toxic, how do we toss her out without having the restaurant totally derail until we find someone else?

There's a lot more family context to this situation that stretches outside of my immediate family, but this is pretty long as it is...

Personally, I work for a solo practitioner attorney in New York who specializes in startups, so I have seen PLENTY of family strife tear businesses to pieces. But exposure to those things through a law office doesn't mean I have any idea what my parents ought to do (other than get marriage counseling, but believe me, I've been pushing for that for so damn long, and there has to be ways to mitigate the other problems in the meanwhile).

**TL;DR** Parents started a restaurant, which is exacerbating already extant marital problems. Biggest issue is the general manager, who is not entirely trustworthy (maybe a lot, per my mom's suspicions, maybe just moderate, per my dad's), but as neither of my parents have prior experience running a restaurant, they can't agree on whether to just kick her out or not (and how to handle things if they were to).

I'm so sorry about the wall of text...this is making my short break that I get to have to see my family every year a living nightmare.",,False,self,t5_2qr34,False,,,True,t3_16x35m,http://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/16x35m/startup_woes_in_a_family_attempting_to_open_a/,

I'm a recent new small business owner after filing to form a single member LLC earlier this year. I know that single member LLCs are a disregarded entity in terms of filing for federal. However, I did have some business related travel expenses and other things I can likely deduct for.

Some background information -- wrote a fairly successful online product ~110k in gross sales, but other expenses for contractors is about 30k. So I'm left with ~80k in gross income.

I'm still a student and don't have another job. I did work this summer for federal work study, so I do have some income from that too.

So here's my question(s):

* Should I be using an accountant for my taxes here or should I go with a program such as turbotax or H&amp;R block for filing my taxes? Any preference for TT vs H&amp;Rblock?

* If the latter, should I be selecting the personal version of say turbotax or the home &amp; business package as opposed to just the personal one?

* I heard that I should be paying some amount of estimated tax? I haven't really paid any taxes/assessments so far since I assumed I'm pass through as a single member LLC. But I don't want to get dinged either, since I am going to owe a significant amount to the Fed/State/FICA it seems?

* I want to open a 401k through my business. Should I do this before filing? I'll likely go with a Roth 401k if I can, so I assume since it's taxed this year it will have no bearing on what I do for filing, correct? (Already maxed out Roth IRA for the year).

* Is there anything else as a new to this year SBO that I should know in regard to filing?

Any thoughts are greatly appreciated.

The idea I have has been done but, as far as I know, hasn't been applied to small businesses. Most small business owners I've spoken with do something similar when they hire someone. They post an ad on craigslist (or something similar) then filter through 75-100 resumes sent to a blind email address. 

There are plenty of reasonably priced SaaS applications that can automate this process but there's a small learning curve involved. The systems I've seen use one of three methods for automatically evaluating a candidate: 1) the existence of keywords in their resume, 2) requiring additional questions as part of the online application process, and 3) investigating their social footprint. 1 and 2 seem naive to me. Number 3 makes me want to break out my tinfoil hat and live in a cave.

I know the technology exists to extract semantic information from resumes. I'm working on a prototype now that has me pretty stoked. It's not too much further to extracting similar information from a job description. Again, this has already been done and a few companies are selling this technology to large enterprises.

A concrete example might work like this: A job description is uploaded to a website where key information is extracted. Things like skills, job titles, technologies, industry, etc are extracted along with a time span. So ""A software developer with five years of experience using the Microsoft technology stack"" matches a resume that mentions C#, Sql Server and ASP.NET where those technologies were used within the last five years. Resumes are pulled from an email inbox, parsed, matched, and scored against an associated job description then made available for Hiring Manager Bob to review. Let's say HMB has 50 qualified applicants but would prefer to interview locally. HMB's boss prefers someone with industry experience. If the extracted information was presented to HMB and HMBB in a browsable form then they could prioritize the resumes they wanted to read.

I've got a situation that I'm a bit out of my league with at the moment, and I'm hoping you guys can help out.  Sorry for the length:

He does quite well, but unfortunately he is in the later stages of a disease that is quickly making it difficult for him to perform his job.  I was asked if I would be willing to help him out, which I was glad to accept.  The thing is, he doesn't want to take on an employee, so instead it was presented to me as I open my own computer repair business and he refers the customers to me.  

I am perfectly capable of doing the computer work, but I'm at a bit of a loss about where to start, which is where /r/smallbusiness comes in (I hope):

1) Is this type of setup/deal legal?
2) Any tips on how to proceed?  
3) Do I LLC or just DBA?
4) What tax implications do I need to think about? Insurance?
5) Anything I'm overlooking here?


My father in law is pressuring me to start this up as fast as I can in order to help his friend, as his friend is already losing some business because he isn't able to get around. However, I feel like taking a step back and figuring out all this stuff first is much more important.

I told the investor that the business would pay back his contribution within 10 months (at $250/month), with a guaranteed return on his investment.  I offered an extra 10% on top of his investment, but he said he would be more interested in having a partial ownership of the company.

Here's the thing - I'm really new to business, and I'm not sure how a 'partial ownership' agreement would work.  Would I just give him, say, 5% of the company? Does that mean that 5% of our profits would go directly to him ad perpetuam?  Or would it be the case that he could divest his share at any point for 5% of the total company value?

My wife and I want to own our own business. She has about 8 or so years of experience in coffee, and she even leased someone's business outright for a short period of time several years ago. I have full faith in her barista/training abilities and I would be handling the back office.

My first talking point would be whether to buy or start anew. We live a small town in Northern CA. There are 2 coffee shops here - and I firmly believe that our only real option toward getting ourselves a solvent business in this town would be to buy one of the shops out-right. I consider the market rather saturated and would be happier with a loan in order to take the business and its established traffic. (And majority of the town's coffee sales). I firmly believe that it would work out if we did.. the only reservation is that it's going to be a large.. large loan. 

We are starting with between $50k and $100k cash - and are hoping that if need be we can leverage a loan with the local bank (almost right next door to the coffee shop) to make it happen.

I'm more comfortable with the idea of starting from scratch because it can be cheaper than buying someone out. You don't have to ""buy the name"" and you can make the business whatever you want to.. finesse the aesthetics and whatnot.. but the downside of course is that you don't have established traffic to kick things off from the very start.

I just graduated in January and he is going to graduate in 2 weeks.

We've always tossed ideas back and forth to each other, and have known we want to be in the area of biotech research, as that is where our area of expertise lies.  We'd both like to get something going before we go off to graduate school in 1-3 years (that is the plan...but nothing always goes according to plan)

We have outlined 3 possible paths for revenue:

Selling a kit (product)-Probably the most attainable goal at this moment, as constructing it involves skills we already have and are familiar with, the only input we would need when the time comes is money to make some of them, package them, and market them to our target audience.

Selling a service (culturing and isolating specific microorganisms)-This involves skills we are still honing, and I am sure culturing for diagnostics for medical facilities like hospitals would require licenses, and a proof of expertise we just don't have at this moment. (I wouldn't feel comfortable ID'ing a microorganism for a hospital that could potentially give a bad diagnosis and lead to someone's health being affected)

Discovering new bioactive compounds - This is the ultimate goal of the company, to self-fund future research via discovering and licensing useful novel molecules like antimycotics or antibacterial agents.  This is also a long way off because it requires the most expensive equipment, on the order of tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars.  For NMR, HPLC, and LC-MS machines. (Analytical chemistry machines).

We are both going to be taking jobs at local biotech companies because we are both in debt from student loans and want to save money to fund ourselves.  I have had some questions about intellectual property claims and conflict of interest problems, because we will be carrying out our own research after our 9-5's during the weekdays and weekends.   Meaning, we don't want to discover something useful to our company, and then have the companies we work for try to claim that we thought of it while working for them.  

Companies can't claim IP ownership over something you discover on your own time or while working for a 2nd employer (our company) can they?  (The companies won't be in the exact field we want to do research in, it is a different area of biochemistry)

Neither of us have any belongings or personal assets, besides $25,000 in student loans...so I can't see someone coming after my house or car because I don't own either.

So...I am in Massachusetts

Here is a link to my states LLP page

http://www.sec.state.ma.us/cor/corpweb/corllp/llpinf.htm

and LLC page

http://www.sec.state.ma.us/cor/corpweb/corllc/llcinf.htm

The only real difference I see is that LLP's are automatically taxed as a ""partnership"" and an LLC, since it WILL NOT BE a sole proprietorship...can be taxed as a few different things?

If we wanted to have equal share in the company, 50/50, but NOT be responsible for each other's life decisions, does an LLC or LLP make more sense?

We also wanted to register our name to ""save"" it so to speak, but it looks like it'll cost about $500 to register, and another $500 annually to file the report.  I can't see us having a product ready to sell before 6 months. That is, finished, tested, packaged, marketed etc etc .

So questions in an easier to read format.

1. Can your employer lay claim to intellectual property you discovered on your own time (ie-after 9-5 business hours)?
2. Does having your own LLC/LLP allow you to claim intellectual property for your own company for all the other hours of the day you are not at employer #1?
3. For two poor college students who don't want to be responsible for each other's life decisions outside our company/partnership, does an LLC or LLP make more sense? 
4. To register our name with the state and ""save"" it for ourselves, what are the minimum number of things (forms) you recommend we submit?   -We have rough drafted a business plan, but not made it ""final"", and we have no operating agreement yet which will outline as many ""what ifs"" as we can, so that hardships down the road can be settled by a written and signed contract we both agreed to in the beginning.

Thanks for any help or tips you can offer, related or not, and sorry for the rather long winded multi-question post.

2.  Let's say I decide to do all the packing and shipping myself.  I really want some level of anonymity between me and my customers.  I'm not sure how to go about doing this if I ship from home.  Would a P.O. Box work?  What about returns??  I don't want to give out my physical address.

3.  Is it better to use some kind of 3rd party to handle all the shipping and packing?  If so, any companies in mind?

4.  If a 3rd party company was involved for shipping, how would it link with the ecommerce section of my wordpress account?

I'm starting a [distillery](http://brothersvilgalys.com) in North Carolina, and have a unique dilemma that I wonder if you have any thoughts on. I have a wonderful product called Krupnikas, which is a spiced honey liqueur traditional to Lithuania. There's nothing like it on the US market right now. I know the industry reasonably well for a first-timer, and I have a detailed business plan written up, and I've got some fairly good projections based on what other brands are selling. Really the only thing left to do is raise the money, lease the facility, apply for the permits, and get started. 

And that's where it gets complicated. NC operates a state-run monopoly over liquor sales. The way things are now, all liquor sales are routed through the central ABC warehouse to the local ABC stores, regardless of where they're being sold. I can work under the current system just fine, as a state monopoly actually benefits the little guys. I even get better shelf space for being an in-state product. 

So essentially, my location 'doesn't matter' under the current system. I can save a lot of money and locate in an industrial condo, or wherever. But there's a chance that may change. A bill was introduced last year, NC Senate Bill 713, which would allow distilleries to sell their own products to the public (from their own location). It passed the state senate easily, but has been hung up in the house for almost a year now with nobody acting on it. 

Durham is experiencing a renaissance of new businesses. In the past five years, the downtown area has completely changed. There are some properties in great locations for very good prices. A prominent brewery near the location I want does 2/3rds of their business from their on-premise tavern, so if the bill passes, it clearly shifts the focus towards the direct-to-public bottle sales. 

For about $60k I can get the basic equipment I need, install it in a small industrial space, and just start making this stuff. But I'd be in a gated industrial park that's not really the sort of place you invite visitors. To 'do it right' in the downtown area, we're looking at about $170k, which includes paying myself a small salary so I can work full time, buying some nicer equipment, running everything more sustainably (wood gasification), and trying to host a lot of community events. If my projections are anywhere in the ballpark of correct, having direct sales would easily make up the difference in cost. 

I've been on the phone with a few state reps, but so far none of them have much of an idea if any kind of action is really going to happen on this. The original proponent of the bill, another distillery, doesn't seem to know what's happening with it, or they're just not telling me. Another well-connected person I spoke to told me there's doesn't seem to be anyone to sponsor it in the house. 

So I'm wondering what the best course of action is here. How many of you have faced something similar? Should I just ignore the state legislature and get underway, then see how it goes? What about getting stuck in a lease and watching the prime spots dry up? Should I be spending all my time pestering my state legislators? If so, what's the best way to do that?
