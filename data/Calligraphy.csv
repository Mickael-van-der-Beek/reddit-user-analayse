This one didn't have one, so I figured I'd give it a shot. (Also because people have been asking how to start fairly often!) As always, if you feel I missed something, said something wrong, found this useful, etc etc, please comment! 

EDIT: I feel like I should add that this is a post for Western calligraphy. I don't know Arabic or Eastern styles (yet). 

---

**Getting Started**

The best way to get started is to grab a beginner calligraphy book off a shelf. Art stores tend to have a wider range than regular bookstores. Still, this is a niche art form, so if you don't have access to any books, [here's a link to a really great one (in English) as a pdf.](http://calligraphy-expo.com/eng/AboutCalligraphy/Library/LibraryOnLine.aspx?ItemID=1433) 

The books feel overwhelming at first, but just go with it. You'll see that most have a wide range of pens, nibs, inks, paper types, font choices, etc. Don't worry! You won't need to spend an awful lot of money to start! In fact, you can start right now, probably, in your room without buying anything!

To do that: Grab two pencils, put them together with a rubber band and start writing. A great website which shows how to start with [Roundhand, in this style, can be found here](http://calligraphybybillgrant.com/2009/04/10/time-to-get-to-work/). You can also use a whiteboard and a broad tip whiteboard pen. 

Okay, but you want to feel a bit more like a professional with the fancy pens? I started with a basic [pen set such as this one](http://www.scribblers.co.uk/acatalog/manuscript_deluxe_calligraphy_6_set.jpg). They use ink cartridges (instead of needing ink bottles which you dip your pen into continuously) which are a lot easier to work with at a basic level. You can concentrate on forming your letters and spacing and such. 

I suggest you find an alphabet that pulls you in, and you work at writing that one. I'll go into more details below. Remember, the internet is a great resource! If you don't have funds, just Google image search a name ('Gothic', 'English Script', 'Fraktur', 'Carolingian Minuscule', etc.).

---

**Nibs and Pens**

Depending on what type of script or font you'll want to be writing, you will need the proper instrument for it! Each font comes with it's own pen type. And this makes sense, because they're all actual handwriting styles from history. So each culture had to use their materials at hand. Thus you can use wood, feathers (quills), and of course metal, all in various forms. 

[Here is what I currently have going for me](http://imgur.com/Ccc34). (I've got a quill somewhere as well, but I am loathe to use it.) The range of writing implements is much bigger, though! Here are some photographs I took from a book (which I haven't bought yet): [number 1](http://imgur.com/SWRLi), [number 2](http://imgur.com/1sI7j), [close-up 1](http://imgur.com/sCXJ4), [close-up 2](http://imgur.com/1HmH4). You will see paintbrushes here as well. You can use flat ones just as you would metal nibs (though they flow more), or use a tapered point to help fill in details.

The David Harris book I linked above is really great at showing you what type of pen to use with what font. But here is a list!

* Rustic Capitals - square nib
* Square Capitals - wooden, bamboo nib or straight nib
* Uncial and Artificial Uncial - oblique nib or quill
* Insular Majuskel - oblique nib
* Insular Minuskel- square nib
* Carolingian Minuscule - square nib
* Foundational Hand - double pencils or square nib
* Early Gothic - oblique nib
* Textura Quadrata - square nib
* Textura Prescisus - square nib, bamboo nib
* Gothic Capitals and Versals - square nib
* Lombardic Capitals - best to draw outline with narrow nib then fill with ink (I use a flex nib or round nib)
* Bastard Secretary - square nib
* BÃ¢tarde - quill
* Fraktur and Schwabacher - square nib
* Bastard Capitals - square nib or bamboo nib
* Rotunda - square nib
* Humanist Minuscle - either oblique or square nib
* Italic - square nib
* Humanist and Italic Capitals - square nib 
* Italic Swash Capitals - square nib
* Copperplate/English Script - flexible nib or Copperplate nib (they have a bend)
* Imperial Capitals - flat, broad brush
* Cadels - outline in pencil, then any cut nib

A straight pen has an oblique cut nib (about 70Â° to shaft), but you hold it horizontally. A slanted or angled pen has a square cut nib (90Â° to shaft) which needs to be held at an angle (about 30Â°)

It really doesn't matter too much if you're using a straight or angled nib, though. Not if you're just beginning and practicing.  (Also, 'straight' and 'nib' are looking misspelled, I've seen them too often...)

I hardly ever use round nibs (they have a circle of metal in the front), but they can be great for just 'regular' handwriting. 

---

**Ink**

When it comes to ink, there's a variety of choices. If you're using a cartridge pen, just keep buying the same cartridges from your manufacturer. If you're using a dip pen, lets talk ink!

So there are two types of inks: drawing ink and calligraphy ink. Drawing ink tends to be thinner and mostly only comes in black or an umber shade. Calligraphy ink is thicker, and comes in a wide variety of colors. 

[Here is a lovely picture of my inks.](http://imgur.com/Jz58T) It's a German company called Rohers, I have two of their sets: Antiketusche (Antique ink) and regular. The antique colors are especially fun, since they come in such off tones. There are plenty other great companies out there, though! 

You can also see that I'm using a palate (I think it's for aquarell paint, actually). I pipette my ink into there, and then I can dip into one color, and immediately into another to get some interesting tones on paper. This stops my pure ink from being ruined. 

I've also included some gouache paint. If you mix it with enough water (thus the little jars) you can make them fluid enough to write with. Gouache is amazing in that it doesn't lose pigmentation when you dilute it with water. Aquarell is not quite as good. Acrylics and oils are usually too thick, but if you're writing on wood or plastic or heavy canvas, you can always use those! (Just make sure to clean your nibs after!)

A tip to stop your larger bottles / jars from tipping over (my table was blue thanks to tipping a full ink bottle over a few months back) is to [cut some holes into sponges and put the inks in them](http://imgur.com/mYLKs). You can also use the sponges for your drips!

---

**Paper and What to Write On**

You do not want to use printer paper. It is usually 70g and doesn't deal well with the amounts of water you'll be using. Start with something around 120g weight. 

I prefer 200g the most. Also, I prefer rough to smooth paper. It holds the ink better, I find. Paper can get expensive, though, so don't just go out and buy tons! Find something that feels good between your fingers, buy a couple of sheets and then buy more later. 

I found this really wonderful block of Aquarell paper (200g, a little bigger than A4) for a pretty awesome price. It's called Le Grand Block and it's from a German art supply warehouse called BÃ¶sner. 

I tend to go for Aquarell paper, since it is made to hold a lot of water. But, you can use marker paper too! It has a more 'shiny' surface, and the ink tends to run, but it's great for precise works. 

[Here's some examples of what I have lying around](http://imgur.com/mIfcE). The 'Roni' is written on the 200g Aquarell paper, the AA cadel is on marker paper. 

You can also write on other things! Cardboard, wood, plastic, canvas, etc. Your imagination is your limit. Stick to paper while practicing (the cheap kind too), though. You also might need different inks / instruments depending on what you write and/or might need to put a ground substance down first. 


---

**Lastly**

Once you know what you want to write, start by drawing lines on a piece of paper. You're not writing yet! You need to measure the spacing of the nib and make proper lines accordingly. [Here is a picture of what I mean](http://imgur.com/qUSxu). Only after you've got the spacing down can you make sure that your letters will all have the same size. 

Now, start practicing shapes. Yes, shapes. Not even letters yet! You want to get a feel for the pen, how the ink flows, how shapes get made. You want to fill sheets of papers. 

After you've got a pretty good consistency down, you can start with making letters. ~~None of my books had proper images for this,~~ [this book had a proper one sort of](http://imgur.com/JXvQp),  so [here's an example from me](http://imgur.com/0uCzr). You'll see that I used a 3-5-3 spacing (ascenders-main-descenders). Look and see what your book recommends, although this is standard. 

---

**Extra Info**

I always keep a glass/jar of water next to me. It's great to dilute the ink slightly and for added effects on paper. Dip your pen into the water first, then pick up some ink. Play around with it!

After you've gotten the basics of a font down, start playing around with it! I can't find them right now, but a past calligraphy teacher I had made some amazing pieces in only a few minutes. Here is her website, [Birgit Nass](http://www.birgitnass.de/). 

Sponges, tissues, crumpled papers are also great. You can wipe, dab, smear, etc. 

Put a lot of ink on a pieces of paper, then press a pieces of plastic wrap on top and let it dry. Put some large grain salt on some wet ink and let it dry, then brush it off. Both give neat effects. 

Don't be afraid to get messy! You're making art!

So I was discussing with roprop my latest idea:

**TL;DR:** Want to create a reference page for calligraphy letter styles. Need help figuring out how to do it in the best way.

Every so often we want to write something in a font, but the amount of alphabets available to us are either not enough (though lots on the sidebar) or we don't like the letters that are given. [This comment in a WotD thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Calligraphy/comments/19bj7z/word_of_the_day_feb_27_2013_amalgamate/c8mvixi) gave me the idea to create a master thread, where we could all post our letter variations. 

So, while [I took an hour to write these A's](http://i.imgur.com/d16szpK.jpg) you can see that they're still somewhat disorderly, and it's difficult to pick out which style is a Gothic / Blackletter or which is more Uncial or which really belongs in a Typography category / style / genre. 

So, I'm thinking this: start a master thread in which **I'll make 26 posts for the main 26 letters** of the English alphabet (any slight variations like Ã¤Ã¶Ã¼Ã© would go under aoue...]. I would like a **subsection based on genre/style/category**, since that's the main point of doing this. So another 5-6 subposts for so Gothic - Quadratta - Blackletter, Roman, Cursive - style, Lombardic, Uncial / Foundational, Typographic,  Other, etc. 

The only thing is, that this is a bit cluttered, I think. Does anyone have any better suggestions?

**What I want:** Easy to reference page for letter styles and (as many as possible) variations based on letters, not on whole alphabets (since all calligraphy books have them grouped by alphabets). 

Also, there is the subreddit wiki to be used. If anyone can figure out a way to incorporate everyone's works into a wiki page. (I'm still working on it; far from being working wiki yet.)

Thanks guys! Especially thanks to those that help!

P.S. I'd like to start this project within the next week; preferably this weekend if possible. I'd put permanent links on the sidebar, and whenever you come up with another letter variation, you can always add it!",,False,self,t5_2rkjt,False,,,True,t3_19d4vs,http://www.reddit.com/r/Calligraphy/comments/19d4vs/meta_making_a_thread_on_all_calligraphy_letters/,moderator

1363363386.0,29,self.Calligraphy,1actde,Beginner's Material To-Buy List (Broad Edge style and Pointed Pen in comments),xenizondich23,29,0,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/Calligraphy/comments/1actde/beginners_material_tobuy_list_broad_edge_style/,"Hereâs a small beginnerâs material guide for broad nib scripts (Roman, Post Roman, Insular, Gothic, and some Renaissance).  I went into detail on some of the varied types in my [101 Beginnerâs Calligraphy Guide]( http://www.reddit.com/r/Calligraphy/comments/zbvqf/calligraphy_101_for_beginners_and_advanced_artists/), so this is more a what to buy list, rather than an explanation list.

Usually when starting out youâll want to acquire a simple tool or two, and only after knowing that you wish to continue is it better to spend a lot more money on some of the higher priced implements. 

**Calligraphy Marker**: Markers are good for starting out, or if you want to write calligraphy on not flat / smooth surfaces. You can buy special calligraphy markers, (like the ones Staedtler makes]( http://www.amazon.com/Staedtler-Caligraphy-Duo-Markers-3002C5/dp/B003MR4QE4/ref=sr_1_9?s=office-products&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1363361809&amp;sr=1-9), or use a whiteboard marker on a whiteboard.

**Cartridge Pen**: Itâs usually better to start with one of these, since you donât have to worry about refilling ink and getting ink blobs, etc. 

- *Pilot Parallel* (~$10 each) They come in 4 standard sizes: 1.5mm, 2.4mm, 3.8mm and 6.0mm nib width. These are simple the easiest cartridge pens to write with. You can use their cartridges, buy a converter and fill it with ink from a bottle or fill the barrel of the pen directly. 

- *Lamy Joy* (25 Euros ) This was the calligraphy pen I started with. Lamy makes fountain pens, used by generally everyone in Germany. The Joy is their calligraphy pen. You can get a [set]( http://www.amazon.com/Lamy-Calligraphy-Black-Fountain-015SET/dp/B002UWHPQS/ref=sr_1_2?s=office-products&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1363362111&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=lamy+joy) or buy it with just one tip. They make 3 nib sizes: 1.1mm, 1.5mm and 1.9mm. They use Lamy ink cartridges or you can use a Lamy converter ($5 from Goulet pens).

- Other pen set companies include Masterpiece, Staedtler (are rubbish, don't buy), Rotring, Schaeffer and Speedball. They are all *okay* sets. Some work better than others. In general, you will never have very crisp or sharp lines (except the Pilot Parallel) because they are all modelled after fountain pens and have slightly rounded nibs on the front. They are still much more practical for taking travelling or to work / school, though. None of them are too expensive.

**Nibs**: In general, try and buy a starter set of some sort, this way you get many sizes and hopefully different types. Nibs are cheap, and you can usually find boxes of them so I urge you to buy a few of each type to get a feel for them. You should clean your nibs after you are done using them every time. Else theyâll end up turning rusty and looking black like my first nibs. Every so often, take them apart and clean them in ammonia for best use.

- *Speedball Set* ($10) is a great set to start with in general. [Itâs a holder and a few nibs]( http://www.amazon.com/Speedball-Calligraphy-No-1-Artists-Project/dp/B001QWUHF4/ref=sr_1_5?s=office-products&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1363361809&amp;sr=1-5) for various styles, not just broad edge calligraphy. Itâs cheap and lets you try out various nibs to see what you like most.

- Go to your local art store(s) and see what they stock. Often you will just find loose boxes of nibs and holders so pick and choose!

**Ink**: You can use various types of ink for dip nibs. Preferably use inks marked for Calligraphy, since they will have the right consistency and be less harmful to the metal nib. You can use drawing ink, but it tends to be thin. I suggest you donât use India ink or Chinese calligraphy ink for broad nibs, since they are both meant for different styles. I canât forbid you to use them, but do your research on them. 

- *Noodlerâs Inks* (~ $10 per bottle) are fountain pen inks, but can also be used for dip nibs. Like most fountain pen inks. They come in many colors, which you can see on their website. 

- *Rohrer und Klingnerâs Ink* (5 Euros per bottle 50/100ml) this is the ink that I use. I love it. It has very vibrant colors, and a good consistency. You can mix it with water, and mix the inks together easily as well. They have many colors. You can find a list of international retailers on their website. 

**Paper**: I advise against using printer / copier paper, since it tends to have a slightly glossy finish and is treated with chemicals that make it easier for printers to print on them. It is also very thin (usually about 70g weight) which makes inks feather. You want the paper to be untreated, acid free and absorbent.

You can buy paper pretty much in any art, stationary or office supply store. This is actually the easiest of all materials to procure, and usually the most inexpensive. I prefer 200g paper blocks from BÃ¶sner for 10 Euros, but I will also buy large A2/3 sheets in various colors to write on. The lowest weight I go to is about 140g, and usually not heavier than 220g. Aquarelle and watercolor blocks are great for calligraphy, as well as marker papers.

I suggest finding some cheap slightly heavier paper to practice on. Maybe your office supply store has blocks of 100g paper? That should be perfect to start with.

**Misc tools**: All of these arenât necessary, but make calligraphy much easier.

- *A glass with water.* This is to mix with your inks, to rinse out your nibs, and to generally use in projects. 

- *Ink well or Aquarelle tray* I use a Van Gogh aquarelle tray to pipette my inks in when I write. This lets me mix them, and I donât waste so much by keeping a jar open and letting it evaporate. 

- *Ink syringe or pipette* lets you put inks into a well, your converter or a pen more easily.

- *Paper towels or a rag* to wipe your pens on. Also sponges.

- *Ammonia* to clean your nibs in if they get too encrusted with ink

- *Old Toothbrush* to scrub your nibs with. Use with diluted dishwashing soap.

**Places to Buy**

- Art supply stores, especially Hobby Lobby, Michaels, your local neighbourhood one

**No matter your skill level, there is no excuse for your letters to not go in a straight line and to be of unequal height.** Be as fancy as you like with ascenders and descenders and whatever, but you really screw it up when you don't write in a straight line. All you have to do is draw two parallel lines on your paper with a pencil and poof - perfect alignment. Or use thin paper and put it over lined paper so you can see through or use a light table.

If there is one thing that makes what you do more than fancy writing with pretentious pens it is writing in a bloody straight line. Take just a little more time and get it right. When you practice something wrong you just have to unlearn it. Every time you write without guidelines you are only screwing yourself and producing work that will grate on the nerves of anyone who appreciates calligraphy no matter how cool your font, flourishes or subject matter.

On a more specific note, since lots of us here like blackletter, **there is no excuse for your blackletter verticals to not be vertical.** Spacing can be hard, consistency can be hard, whatever, but if your verticals aren't all vertical, draw some lines and do it right. It only takes a few seconds to draw a dozen vertical lines in pencil. Just do it and then your work will look like a developing calligrapher and not like my little sister got into my pens. Again, you only screw yourself by getting in bad habits. Do it right.

Most drummers think they can keep time without a metronome. Most are wrong. It doesn't make a person a shitty drummer to not be able to keep perfect time, it makes them a shitty drummer if they are too lazy to do the simple thing that will give them perfect time - use a metronome.

Sorry for being such a grouchy old man, its just that I like a lot of the work and creativity I see here but don't have much to say other than ""that would be worth posting if you took the two extra minutes to write it in a straight line.""

Yah, there is a time and place for freehand, but you'll never be any good at it if you don't have the discipline to use a few guidelines.

More information can be found on IAMPETH's website [here](http://www.iampeth.com/lessons_flourishing.php). I recommend reading the first too links (the .pdfs)

1367384937.0,23,self.Calligraphy,1dgr77,Since I'm really bloody bored... How about a bajillion cool links on French/German roundhand?,thang1thang2,26,3,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/Calligraphy/comments/1dgr77/since_im_really_bloody_bored_how_about_a/,"Woooo! ADHD's kicking in. So instead of doing homework, I decided to research the Ronde hand. Also called German round-hand or the ""French Roundhand""

A little history: This roundhand was developed in France after the french generals were ordered to use only a certain selection of writing scripts for all their forms and stuff, for uniformity (think ""times new roman 12 font double spaced"" we have today). These were the ""bastarde"" ""ronde"" and another hand nobody cares about, and an french italic hand.

Now, this hand was developed, and picked up by the germans, and it's become the beautiful script it is today. It, unlike most other script styles, is written with a broad edged nib, thus making it ideal for people who want to write a ""roundhand"" type of cursive script, but don't have a pointed pen! (It's also, notably, much easier to get broad nibs that perform amazingly well for cheap, e.g. fountain pens, rather than getting expensive vintage fountain pens for calligraphy on the go). German round hand, however, is slightly heavier than the french version, although they're practically identical. Anyway! On to the goodies!

**French Ronde Hand (And some german)**

1. [Simply the alphabet + numerals](http://i.imgur.com/FPIZz.jpg)
2. [An incredibly extensive analysis of the Rounde hand as well as batarde](http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=did;cc=did;rgn=main;view=text;idno=did2222.0001.403). Also includes how to cut your quill. While this was traditionally written with a quill pen by the ""masters"" of the script. It was easily written by a broad nibbed pen as well, though the hairlines suffered in lightness.
3. [A flickr photo group containing English roundhands and the French rounde hand](http://www.flickr.com/photos/23416307@N04/sets/72157623018363588/with/4219084368/). Very beautifully constructed. May be exceptionally helpful in seeing how the forms are created.
4. [History of the Ronde Hand](http://julien.chazal.free.fr/pages/La-Calligraphie/Ronde.html) Also includes some pages not seen elsewhere and examples.
5. [Yet another alphabet](http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5004/5287112918_299632bc53_z.jpg). This one includes information on length of descenders, which is why it's here.
6. [Another alphabet exemplar. This time with paragraphs of text](http://luc.devroye.org/NewSpecncerianCompendium-ca1882-FrenchRoundHand.jpg) Isn't it so bloody pretty? It's from the New Spencerian Compendium (1882). Available for free on IAMPETH

Here's the german roundhand!

This gets its own number section thingey because, while it's still french copperplate, e.g. french ronde hand, it calls itself by a different name for absolutely no damn reason whatsoever. I was able to finally trace down this book, it's inside the picasa album in the wiki. [Here is the entire book](https://picasaweb.google.com/tipstricks1/GaetanoFilosaMetodoDiCalligrafia). Very fascinating. A huge assortment of lettering styles from the era. Batarde, Ronde, Rotonda, Italiana (italian roundhand), etc.

**Italian roundhand**

I lied, there's some other cool links in here, not just french and german roundhand; so screw you and check them already.

1. http://www.perrupato.it/calligrafia/calligrafia.htm

And by cool links I mean the one above, and this one. Sorry. I'm weird like that. There are italian copperplate pages spattered around. It wasn't a very popular style that endured, like the english copperplate, or french rondehand. As it was so similar to the english copperplate, over time it became absorbed into it. The ""italian"" copperplate variation became more commonly known as the ""ladies"" hand, due to its more delicate and not-quite-so-heavily-shaded nature.

It doesn't interfere with your nib, unless you wrap it really tight around the tip of course, common sense. But you'll find that hard to do and the band will stay on relatively loosely.

It's not completely done yet, but be sure to take a look around! As of right now there are editing limitations: [see details here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Calligraphy/wiki/editingwiki#wiki_how_to_edit_the_wiki.3F).

2\. We also have a new moderator: /u/roprop (the man who brought you /u/callibot) who helped an enormous amount in getting the code straightened out to make this all possible.

You'll also notice a few changes on the main page:

3\. a new menu at the top of every page, that will easily get you to the wiki, the QotW and to any other current projects going on, and

4\. a new, more compressed sidebar! Geez that thing before was a monster! I hope to compress this even more as buttons become redundant. 

5\. Lastly, I'd just like to **welcome all the new subscribers** that pushed us over 5k members. You guys are an awesome community, and I hope that it you'll keep submitting, commenting and helping each other out!

It's something that will either make or break a composition. Even if you have flawless letters, but bad spacing? Crap. If you have great spacing, but only okay-ish letters? It'll look great. 

With that said, here are some links that I've found really helpful in explaining this! If anyone has questions, just ask.

3. [Cool pictures to help you possibly get an idea of all this](http://www.dancingpencalligraphy.com/howto/LetterSpacing.html)
4. You guys are super special and I love you lots, so you'll get an actual image by *me* that I wrote just for you guys to try and help you out. It's not my best writing. I didn't use guidelines or anything. So forgive the messy script and try and see beyond that to the idea behind it. Again, any questions? Just ask!

Here are the rules: answer the questions as honestly as possible. Stick to simple answers (don't overwhelm yourself).


1) What do you think is your strongest skill in calligraphy?

2) What is **one** calligraphy skill that you would like to improve upon? (Edit: this can be as simple as a specific font or even a specific letter that gives you trouble)

3) What is something you can do (besides practicing) to get better at the skill in #2?

4) Give yourself a time scale to work on this skill (at the end of this time, you will reevaluate your skill and either change your goal or keep working on it).

Wizard / Medieval style.,xenizondich23,16,1,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/Calligraphy/comments/12uqne/writing_exercise_by_request_of_rhandwriting/,"So some folks over in /r/handwriting wanted to see some wizard-like or medieval style writing. I figured why don't we get involved! 

I'm thinking something medieval would be Foundational (Book of Kells) or around that time period. The free PDF book on the sidebar has a great timeline. 

A wizard-like font I figured would be spindly calligraphy. A Google search I did a while back gave the Harry Potter fonts, one of which is Dumbledore's handwriting. 

So, anyone care to just write out any ol' passage in either of the two fonts? 

**EDIT:** Obviously you guys need some prompts. If you don't want to find something, here you go:

&gt;Over hill, over dale,

&gt;Thorough bush, thorough brier,

&gt;Over park, over pale,

&gt;Thorough flood, thorough fire,

&gt;I do wander everywhere.

âA fairy's answer to Puck's question, ""whither wander you?"", A Midsummer Nights Dream, Shakespeare

&gt;I know a bank where the wild thyme blows,

&gt;Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows,

&gt;Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine,

&gt;With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine.

âOberon describes Titania's bower, where she sleeps, A Midsummer Nights Dream, Shakespeare

&gt;""It's that you each, to shorten the long journey,

&gt;Shall tell two tales en route to Canterbury,

&gt;And, coming homeward, another two,

&gt;Stories of things that happened long ago.

&gt;Whoever best acquits himself, and tells

&gt;The most amusing and instructive tale,

&gt;Shall have a dinner, paid by us all,

&gt;Here in this roof, and under this roof-tree,

-General Prologue Canterbury Tales - 
Inkeeper and Host, said to the pilgrims traveling to Canterbury

&gt;Suddenly then

&gt;the God-cursed brute was creating havoc:

&gt;greedy and grim, he grabbed thirty men

&gt;flushed up and inflamed from the raid,

&gt;blundering back with the butchered corpses.

I haven't actually tried any of these recipes, so I have no idea whether they're any good or not. I didn't bother modernizing the spelling, but I apologize in advance for any typos I may have inadvertently introduced. I've linked to PDFs of the books for the definitive versions.

**From [A New Booke of Hands](http://shipbrook.net/jeff/bookshelf/download.html?bookid=2) (1611):**

To make common Inke of wine take a quart,  
Two ounces of Gumme let that be a part,  
Fiue ounces of Gals, of Copres take three,  
Long standing doth make it the better to be.  
If wine ye do want, raine water is best,  
And then as much stuffe as aboue at the least.  
If Inke be too thicke, put vineger in:  
For water doth make the colour more dim.

There are a couple other recipes which follow that one, but they don't actually give proportions. I assume ""Copres"" is copperas, or ferrous sulfate (""green vitriol""). Or possibly copper sulfate (""blue vitriol"").

**From [A Booke of Secrets: Shewing diuers ways to make and prepare all sorts of Inke, and Colours](http://shipbrook.net/jeff/bookshelf/download.html?bookid=3) (1596):**

*To make Inke to write vpon paper.*

Take halfe a pint of water, a pint wanting a quarter of wine, and as much vineger, which being mixed together make a quart &amp; a quarter of a pint more, then take six ounces of gauls beaten into small pouder, and sifted through a siue *[sieve]*, put this pouder into a pot by it selfe, and poure halfe the water, wine, and vineger into it, take likewise foure ounces of victriall *[i.e. vitriol]*, and beat it into pouder, and put it also in a pot by it selfe, whereinto put a quarter of the wine, water, &amp; vineger that remaineth, and to the other quarter, put foure ounces of gum Arabike beaten to pouder; that done, couer the three pots close, and let them stand three or foure daies together, stirring them euery day three or foure times, on the first day set the pot with gaules on the fire, and when it begins to seeth, stir it about till it be thoroughly warme, then straine it through a cloath into another pot, and mixe it with the other two pots, stirring them well together, and being couered, then let it stand three daies, till thou meanest to use it, on the fourth day, when it is setled, poure it out, and it wil be good inke. If there remaine any dregs behind, poure some raine water (that hath stand long in a tub or vessell into it, for the older the water is, the better it is, and keepe that vntill you make more inke, so it is better then clean water.

*To make Inke for parchment.*

Make it in all points like to the inke aforesaid, only take a pint of water, &amp; of vineger and wine a pint more, that is, of each halfe a pint.

*Another sort of Inke.*

Take a quart of cleare water, and put it in a glasse, put into it thirteene ounces beaten victriall, let it stand three daies, and stir it three or foure times euery day, then take thirteene ounces of beaten gaules, and put them into a new earthen pot that is wel leaded, poure into them a quart of cleane water, that done, set it on the fire, and let it seeth till it consumeth about a finger deepe, but suffer it not to seeth so fast that it seeth ouer the pots brim then strain it through a wollen cloath, into another pot, that is leaded, poure into the cloath a cup full of good vineger, and strain it through likewise, that done, if there remaineth any thing in the cloath, cast it away, then put into the matter, foure or fiue ounces of beaten gum, and stir them well together, then againe straine them through a cleane wollen cloath, and poure into it a cup full of good vineger, and straine it through the cloath, and let it stand till it be coole, then put it into a straight-necked glasse, stop both the glasses well, till you haue occaion to vse them, then take of each water a little quantitie, and mix them together, so haue you good inke.

*Another of the same sort, but easie to make.*

Take the beaten gauls, and put them in the water doe the like with the victriall in a pot by it self let those two waters stand, and when you haue cause to vse inke, poure out of each pot a like quantitie, and it will be blacke, then put into it a little beaten gum, &amp; it will bee good inke.

*Another.*

Take a quart of strong wine, put it into a new pot, and set it on a soft fire till it be hote, but let it not seeth, then put into it foure ounces of gauls, two ounces and a halfe of gum Arabike, and two ounces of victriall, al beaten into smal pouder, and sifted through a siue, stirre it with a wooden sticke, and it will be good inke.

*Another.*

Take an ounce of beaten gaule, three or four ounces of gum Arabicke, put them together in a pot with raine water, and when the gum is almost consumed, strain it through a cloath, and put into it almost halfe a cup of victriall beaten to pouder.

*Another.*

Take a pint of beere, put into it an ounce of gaules beaten to pouder, let it seeth till it seeme somewhat red, then put to it three quarters of an ounce of greene victriall, in small pouder, and let it seeth againe, when you take it off the fire, cast into it three quarters of an ounce of gum, and a small peece of alum *[potassium aluminum sulfate]*, both in pouder, and stir them all together till it be cold.

*Another.*

Take two handfull of gauls, cut each gaule either into three or four peeces, poure into them a pint of beere or wine, (which you wil) then let it stand eight houres, straine it from the gaules, and put victriall therein, and to the victriall a third part of gum, set it on the fire to warm, but let it not seeth, and it will bee good inke: and of those gaules you may make inke foure or fiue times more.

*To make inke vpon a suddaine, to serue in an extremitie.*

Take a wax candle, and light it, hold it vnder a cleane bason or a candelsticke, till the smoke of the candle hangeth theron, then put a little warme gum water into it, which tempered together will be good inke.

*To keepe Inke that it sinketh not into the paper neither that it come not off, and that moths nor mise hurt not the paper.*

Take the shels of hazell nuts, and put them into the inke, and it will not sinke through the paper. And that it may not come off, put a little salt into it. To keepe that neither Mise nor eat or fret the paper, put a little wormewood water into the inke.

It's amazing the complete lack of interesting documentary on calligraphy. Coming from a more ""traditional"" background (drawing and tattoo fan) I'm used to finding loads of interesting resources, interviews and the like. None of that exists in calligraphy. There is one short interview of Niels Meulman and one super-pixellised video of the White House calligraphy office.

I want to film a series on calligraphy. I want to travel around the world and meet artist, have them walk us through their cities, their life and their culture's calligraphy. I want to cover Arabic, Asiatic, Russian, German, American calligraphy. I want it to be interesting but fun, thorough but chaotic, like any of these world tour cooking shows (Gordon Ramsay's great escape, Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations).

The problem is that I lack pretty much everything. I lack funding, tools, legal knowledge, and I'm pretty much alone in my thought. I wanted to run it past you first, and see if I can get people as psyched as I am in my own mind, to make that come true. People that would be willing to put some effort into helping me, but also people who could tell me ""yeah, that totally sounds interesting"", so I know I'm not alone.

I intend to make this the post people go to whenever they have a question regarding both stationery and calligraphy, and was hoping you folks could help me out with it; for you see, I don't actually know much on the subject myself. I will, however, update this top post with the information we pool. So I'll start off with a few questions. 

* *Types of paper are categorized (mainly) by their density (also called [""Grammage""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_density#Grammage)). Where a typical xerox sheet's grammage is about 80g, it isn't favorable to calligraphy due to the increased amounts and weight of ink an art pen puts on the paper. This leads to what is called ""feathering"" or the loss of crispness caused by the pattern in which lighter density sheets absorb the ink. In your experience, what is a proper density that cooperates well with the heavier ink loads from calligraphy pens with square nibs as well as for pointed nib pens, which provide not as heavy a load but still heavier than, say, a ballpoint bic?* 

-When using standard paper for practicing, the general consensus seems to be the denser the better; however, Make sure that you're at least at a density rating of **100g** or over to ensure you get the most crisp lines from your pen. Densities under this will spread your ink as it gets absorbed and blur out your edges. Similarly, if the paper you're using isn't **acid-free**, the sheets will discolor and deteriorate, eventually becoming yellow and brittle with exposure to light over time. Even still, densities of sheets come in several flavors of smoothness, which isn't too much of an issue for square nib users. If you're using a pointed nib, however, a rough sheet will cause ripping and cutting on the paper from the sharp point of the nib. Not only will this ruin your work, but it will really damage your equipment. **Smooth** is definitely the way to go for pointed nib pens.

* *Many companies that offer [pads of paper meant specifically for the use of calligraphy](http://www.amazon.com/Strathmore-400-Series-Calligraphy-sheets/dp/B000KNNVX0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1350437560&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=calligraphy+paper) utilize specially treated sheets of paper similar to magazine sheets, which have an [ink resistant coating](http://www.penboutique.com/c-83-notepads.aspx?SearchTerm=&amp;ManufacturerID=91&amp;SectionID=0&amp;Pagesize=60&amp;Order=3) that prevents the ""feathering"" effect that you get when a rougher sheet of paper absorbs your ink, but also makes it so that the ink dries much slower. What do you guys prefer: treated or non-treated? If you use one or the other, which do you prefer and why? Are there some other side effects to using one over the other? Or are there just different situations or pen setups that make one more favorable in that case?*

-There are so many varieties of treated papers that choosing the one that's right for you becomes a matter of preference, but there are correlations to combinations of pens, inks, and stationery. Just like before, you're still going to prefer the smooth treatments such as **Vellum or Bristol**, especially if you're using a pointed nib. However, if you're using lighter, more watery inks, you might want to give **watercolor/aquarelle** pads a try, which are made for absorbing watery substances in a crisp fashion. Generally speaking, any surface meant to be used with any kinds of paints are going to be responsive and cooperative with calligraphic inks, more often than not. That being said, it's always a good idea to **experiment**; buy a few sheets as opposed to an entire block to practice with and see if it fits your style. Make sure it looks good and sits well with you before you commit. 

* *For those of us partial to the more cursive and thin fonts such as Copperplate or Spencerian as opposed to the bolder and straighter fonts such as Black-letter or Traditional Old-English, stationery with guides on them are godsend for practice. Here's a two-parter: In terms of the three most common forms of guided paper, (lined notebook, graph, and dotted) which is more accommodating to the writing style at both beginner levels and expert levels? And the second part: Would you rather make your own guided sheets that have slanted ruling? Or perhaps you are privy to commercial slanted guiding stationery specific for calligraphy is available in larger quantities.*

-""Training pads"" come in **various sizes and paper types for different fonts**, but it may be difficult to find a specific font you're looking for, or maybe you find your font but the sheets don't work well with your setup. The unfavorable factor to the pads is that they're **pricier than normal** paper obviously, but the ""try before you buy (in bulk)"" option isn't available. Unfortunately, the best thing we can say for you if you can't find something that works for you is to **make it yourself**. Personally I think it rare that you don't find something already commercialized unless you're looking for something phenomenally niche. If that happens to be the case, then you can always find the stationery you like and are comfortable with and find some way to make your own guides that you can put on the paper itself. Whether it's through a light table, office printer, or projection... where there's a will, there's a way.

* *It is not uncommon for a deliberate and specific occasion (read: commission/not for practice) to use [special forms of card-stock](http://instagram.com/p/RvUHbdBN12/) as opposed to a sheet of paper to really bring out the classiness of a piece and make it look marvelously fancy. For those of us that are planning to take calligraphy past the hobby level, what are your favorite platforms you enjoy using to show off your best work and the paradigm of your effort and talent?*

P.S.
It would be quite helpful if, when answering, you could provide two versions of your answer: one from a maximum quality standpoint, and another from quite a more frugal standpoint.

Firstly, in spite of spectacular complaints against doing so (we shall not point any fingers), we have decided to change to our summer theme early. Since your subreddit styling is enabled(!), you can now admire this wonderful sunny theme made for us by /u/rubrica! Thanks a lot! :D You're awesome. /u/xenizondich23 will make a new banner for the theme soon.

We have also distinguished periodic/regular posts a bit by colouring the title blue. Apparently not all of you notice the Word of the Day posts! *hint hint :)*

**Link flairs** have now been implemented. This is response to previous discussions about making it easier to give constructive critisism. The idea is that people put flair on their posts as an indicator of what level of feedback/critisism they want. With this in use, we hope that useful critisism will no longer fall on deaf ears, but instead be welcomed as desired. We encourage everyone with advice/suggestions/critisism to give to do so. Pleaso don't downvote people who are giving helpful advice to improve. Please don't let such downvotes stop you from contributing your knowledge to the community.

The link flairs currently available are ""request"", ""just for fun"", ""be gentle"", ""tutor me"" and ""be brutal"". Use them when relevant, and let us know what you think!

Note that the ""flair"" button appears after you've submitted the post. It looks [like this](http://i.imgur.com/gLpCPv4.png), and you select a flair [like this](http://i.imgur.com/ecC6X5G.png).

**The archives** have been [moved to the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/Calligraphy/wiki/archives2013summer). The archives will also soon include every scheduled/periodic/regular post posted by /u/callibot. This is expected to also include the Penpal Signup posts hitherto posted by /u/terribleatkaraoke as well as the Progress posts hitherto posted by /u/reepicheep37. You're both awesome. Thanks! :)

Because one archive page is not enough, we have the pleasure of announcing the [Archive of Archives](http://www.reddit.com/r/Calligraphy/wiki/archives). Go check it out! Notice that there's a comprehensive archive of [Request]s, compiled by /u/xenizondich23. Please update this as you fulfill requests in the future, or message the mods if you can't! :)

**The [Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/Calligraphy/wiki/index)** is being split up into separate pages to make it less cluttered. Currently only the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/Calligraphy/wiki/faq) and all of the archives have pages of their own, but more will follow.

We encourage all of you to contribute to the wiki if you can. You can read about editing requirements [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Calligraphy/wiki/editingwiki). If you don't have enough karma to edit, just [message the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FCalligraphy) and we can probably work something out!

**Let us know what you think!** What are your thoughts on the above? What would you like to see changed? What are your questions and complaints?

We surpassed 6000 subscribers a few days ago. Well done! :D Keep participating and contributing as much as you can. You're all awesome.

Thanks for making this place what it is :)

Last week some admin/dev implemented the option to make the traffic stats page visible to all users of a subreddit. And since it's a fun place to check out every so often, I figured I'd make that option available to you all.

I'll put a link on the sidebar under 'Helpful Links' as well. 

Post know if you have any issues (hopefully not!) or anything else you care to address. Also, we moderators are just a [mod mail]() away in case anything else ever comes up!

Hello /r/Calligraphy, recently I made my first proper post referencing a meme and some fairly average quality (being generous here) Calligraphy work. Whilst I appreciate the recognition, I think that this subreddit prides itself on work that is of a higher content quality and, potentially, emotional investment. Once I saw the post reach about 40 I was gobsmacked, honestly the point it has reached as I type this is just ridiculous. For a subreddit that basically fostered, fed and raised my interest in Calligraphy, I feel as though a meme doesn't deserve to be at the top post.

Now, this post isn't meant to discourage or chide anyone (beginner, amateur, or expert) that feels as though they have work to share. Share it!

The post feeds on the broader side of Reddit and I hope you agree with my decision to remove it. Good for a laugh, but not that good.

P.S Quick shout-out to /u/floiancu. Sorry your work will also disappear in the comments (at least I think that's how it works).",meta,False,self,t5_2rkjt,False,postflair4,,True,t3_1hmam3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Calligraphy/comments/1hmam3/removing_a_post/,

No need for the tutors to be incredibly good at calligraphy. If I'm a beginner but less of a beginner than you, I may be in a good position to answer some of your questions and advise you.

Although PMs and posts may work, we could also spice it up with a pen-pal kind of thing. The tutors and tutee would write to each other, where the mentored can learn from both the composition and the first-hand advice of the mentor's letter.

**I am sorry if I end up sounding critical in all this** 

I ***know*** that many are beginners here, my purpose here is to inform, **not** bash and look down upon. 

I ***know*** that it's all art and being nit picky on definitions can sometimes get silly, but I believe we all should be educated on what everything means at its core. Using proper language is important as not to skew meaning. We're calligraphers, after all, we heighten language and glorify it to bring due respect to the meaning! 

I notice around here a confusion of terms. 

People say ""font"" when they should say ""hand"" or ""script"". 

People use terms like ""kerning"" when in calligraphy, no such thing exists. It's just letter spacing. 

Kerning refers to moving around a letter that is already created. 

Letter spacing for calligraphy depends heavily on how you made the previous letter. Sheila Waters, the Queen of American Calligraphy (look her up!), says that to space letters, you want to give as much space between the letters as there is in the letters. (You do this to give the word a consistent texture). So I hope you can see that there is a difference there. 

There are posts here that are, in fact, lettering, and not calligraphy. I'm not saying kick the letterers out. I **love** lettering, and I wish I could do it better, I think we must make a distinction and not call lettering calligraphy, however. 

Calligraphy is *penmanship* while lettering in *draftsmanship*. They are both *awesome* but they are, in fact, different.  

I'm being oh so technical here, I know. I'm not suggesting that you must change how you speak, the true meaning of words and how we use words in conversation is a huge difference and we often don't notice. That's just how language works.

**Lecture over, there will be no test. Just take these and file them away in your mind as fun facts or something. This is art, after all, and definitions don't make anything more or less aesthetic :)**

There is no such thing as cheating in calligraphy. Many people advocated tracing back in the day as the fastest method of learning scripts. Now we know that's not the case, due to science, but it was absolutely acceptable to buy letters, tracing paper and COPY stuff. If that was acceptable, just think how much else was acceptable to learn.

Calligraphy should be thought of, perhaps, as a work of art with in each letter, in each detail of the creation. When you draw, you sketch and then fill in, erase and outline, modify and edit until you're finished. Why shouldn't it be the same way to write? All you are doing is ""drawing"" letters rather than people, or birds, or trees, or whatever. 99% of the masters would square off all their letters in copperplate. Everyone used horizontal guidelines, almost every one used vertical ones for slant as well. Only those who had done it for decades, such as ken, had no need of the latter. But still they used the former. It's not cheating! 

Drawing each letter in its own, as a creation of work, able to stand on its own in elegance, poise and beauty is not a bad thing, if anything it is a good thing. What an aspiration to be able to make something so elegant and beautiful that each and every detail of it was beautiful on its own, and even more beautiful together. Whether it be running, gymnastics, sport or chess, drawing or clay making, glass blowing or painting, whether it be anything under the sun, isn't that one of the most greatest accomplishments of your craft? To master it to such a degree that each and every part of it is equal in beauty as such that the combined effect is one of even greater passion? Why not so for calligraphy? 

In closing, do not be afraid to study, to trace, to draw, to labor, to perfect and retouch, to strive after the unattainable, only to obtain it in the end. It is a worthy goal, and no matter how you achieve the end result, it most definitely justifies the means,


By the way, the only reason tracing is no longer advocated is because it discourages the brain from memorizing the letterforms and you become dependent on the tracing, not on your inherent and learned skill. Not for the ""badness"" of it, simply that it is an imperfect method to reach the goals that you are most likely trying to reach. If your goal is to make a pretty letter and you don't care if you can do it without the tracing paper or not, then by all means trace it! There is no sin in the act.

I posted this for the great people over at /r/Handwriting and was referred here, so I figured I'd give it a shot.

I've recently been looking for someone with immense calligraphy skills to design a new text-based logo for my band Me Versus I. Right now our logo is used with a free computerized font that we got off of Freefonts, which doesn't make it very genuine. I'm designing a custom drumset with the folks over at SJC in Dudley MA and I need a new less-computerized logo for the bass drum.

Anyone with a scanner or a PC art tablet would be great. The logo we have now itself is pretty simple, it's a cursive-based text logo with lots of sans. The font used is called The King and Queen, which I'm a big fan of, but it just doesn't compare to a unique original hand-drawn logo.

Your art will be going on my bass drum to be toured around the US with, so please use your imagination! It won't be limited to just the bass drum, either - it could be going on t-shirts, stickers, CDs, and loads of other merch. You could make one, or two, or even five logos, and the one we choose we'll be forever in their debt. Think of it not only as doing a favor, but an experience to improve upon your skills as a writer and a calligraphy artist. As musicians, we know all about improvement and trial/error.

Below is the logo as it stands now. You can use this as a reference and to get an idea of what we're looking for. It's elegant but sharp and rugged. It should be aesthetically pleasing, but practical and easy to read. Nothing too feminine, definitely more masculine. Think about a rose with chest hair.

This time, I'll do a V-Day special thing.

---

**You don't need to send anyone anything for this.**

Unlike the Christmas Card exchange (I still haven't gotten any card *sad*) you won't need to actually send anyone anything this time around.

---

**What to Do?**

I suggest that if you're making a card for a significant other, before you write down any personal information you can take a picture and post it here. If you don't have a significant other but don't want to feel too heartbreakingly lonely, you can just make a card and post it here. If your pet is your only companion, feel free to tell them how much you care on this Valentine's!

---

**Criteria**

**1** *It should be Valentine's themed-related.*  What does this mean? You can buy a store-made card, and write in that. You can fashion your own heart. You can make it pink, purple, white, red. But keep it in the spirit of love. 

(Think of it this way: If you're making a zombie munching a brain card, you're not keeping it valentines related. If he's munching a heart, though, you're okay.)
 
**2** *There should be calligraphy on it somewhere. Any writing should be calligraphy.* 
 
**3** *Please refrain from posting personal information.* 

If your card is full of names, (birth/death)dates, places of living, and other such information that might make it easy for an internet stalker to find you, please don't post it. Also, we don't want to hear about how great your sexual life is in card form. Have respect, to us, your SO and yourself in posting. 

**4** *You have until February 14th to post your results.*

Feb. 14 is Valentine's Day. If you post after that time, I don't think people will come see it. I suspect most people will come here on or right before that date to view the submissions. 

**5** *This is not a contest.*

This is just another place to show off your work. This is not a contest. If someone did a bad job at their calligraphy, don't just say ""it looks terrible"" and move on. Please give them some advice.

I've got the fine art/mechanical drawing/mapping speedball set  and second set is for lettering. The problem is I don't know which nib is used for writing spencerian or copperplate. Anyone shed some light into which nib I need? I've been playing around with the speedball C4 nib and that is nothing like spencerian or copperplate or I'm not doing it right I don't know yet. In the manual that comes with it, they say I need an oblique holder to write spencerian or copperplate but I don't have one so is there another way? 

Edit: these are the nibs I have from the lettering set:

C0, C2, C4, B1, B3, B5, 102, 56, 513EF

Second set for for Fine Line Mechanical Drawing and Mapping: 

99 , 100, 103, 104, 512, 513EF

I will get the ink flowing, hold it at 45 degrees and start writing, only to have it stop and start on the flow and its scratchy on the papers surface. not to mention it skips over the slightest indent on the paper. the worst thing is when im starting a new letter, it doesnt want to start flow until partially through the letter and I have to go back and do the first part of the letter. Also, even when it does flow right away, it never has sharp, crisp letters.

I dont know what I'm doing wrong. Im following the instructions with the pens and the FAQ on how to use new pens.

What I suggest is this:

Make a post in a format like this: 

    | Number | Author | Title| Publication Year | Link | Notes | Example Pages
    |:-----:|:-------|:-------|:-------|:-------|:-------|:------|
    |1||||[]()||[1](), [2](), [index]()|

Then you take some pictures of the book, if possible. Table of contents would be the best, but other highlights as well, as to what makes the book great. 

If it's an ebook please mention that. Screenshots are possible here.

Personally, I own a few calligraphy books, but am always on the lookout for more (yay, bibliophile!)

---

Also, if you download the book images from tipstrick's gallery, and then format them into a pdf and wish to share the link, submit the book in the following format and then a link to download the pdf (mega.co.nz is a great place to store right now).

My calligraphy is atrocious and my pens are quite frankly awful, but i want it to have a nice representation. Can anyone help? 

Life towers far above me,

A strident in his hand;

I sweep my eyes to left and right,

Survey this sunken land.



The shadows cling to everything,

The light clasped in a clot;

And all that I hold beautiful,

Is wrought and caught in rot.



It wasnât always like this though â

I still remember times,

When Life had forged a place for me,

Amidst its tender rhymes.



But now the night has fallen fast;

And all my dice are cast;

I stand before its mighty gaze,

And know I cannot last.



Its strident slowly lowers down;

It points below to me;

In ancient tones, eternal voice,

It speaks: âNow bend your kneeâ.



And in Its breath, I feel the weight,

Of all that I can see;

Crescendos of existence,

Slowly bearing down on me.



I cannot take it anymore;

I stand, to no avail;

It seems as though, at last, I've stepped,

Beyond the nether-veil.



But no.

I am not done here yet.

I raise my head, and blaze,

Life retreats away from me;

It trembles at my gaze.



And all the mystics of Its world,

The centaur, griffin, elf,

They gather round for my reply;

I say... âgo fuck yourself.â



His weapon breaks; it falls to Earth;

The shadows slip away;

The sun climbs high and frees the light,

To shine on the new day.

*


Life may try to break me;

To bend at its command;

But I am made to live and last,

And to the night, withstand.
