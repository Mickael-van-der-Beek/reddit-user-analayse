1322682961.0,40,self.craftit,mv3j2,"Owl Ornament Pattern, plus tips",AyeAyeCaptain,50,10,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/craftit/comments/mv3j2/owl_ornament_pattern_plus_tips/,"Do you remember that adorable [owl ornament](http://i.imgur.com/2mtyd.jpg) that I posted the other day?  Well here is the pattern that a few people requested and I am offering to the community.

Owl Pattern Options: [jpg](http://i.imgur.com/KCFqN.jpg) or [pdf](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B9QFUFpkRGbINjI3NDVkZGEtNWMzZS00OWRiLWIwYmQtZjAzOTUyNjBjOTFk)(Link should be up and running now - if you can't access it and want the pdf file, PM me your email.)

The ornament came out to be about 3 inches around and I put a scale on the pattern so when you print it out you can match it.  I did not include a seam allowance for the body of the owl and that is noted on the pattern. Still haven't learned owl body part names, but reference the picture and it should make sense.  I'm not too up and up on technical terms for sewing, so please ask questions if needed.

As noted in my other thread, I used left over fabric for the body and felt for the wings, head part and eyes (w/ buttons). I used embroidery thread to sew all of the felt onto the body. Total cost under $2. 

CONSTRUCTION TIP: sew the top wing and top head onto the bottom wing and bottom head first; then sew the bottom wings and heads onto the body. 

BODY TIP: sew all of the parts on first before stitching the body together, as I found the hole for the stuffing to be too small for me to work the needle and thread with.  I used my machine last night to sew up the side of body - went quick!  Leave the top of the owl open to stuff and an invisible stitch (regular thread is fine) to close up.

WING &amp; HEAD TIP: when sewing the bottom wings and head onto the body I did another stitch close to where the seam would be so that all sides where closed off and it didn't leave a pocket.

EYE TIP: sew the buttons onto the eye felt first before stitching the lines on.  On my mock up owl I found that I made the lines too close to the where the button sat and the owl looked strung out on crack. 

THREAD TIP: I separated the thread into three strings instead of the usual six it contains.  I found the thread to be too thick, plus double mileage out of the thread; but that is a personal preference.

STUFFING TIP: The more stuffing you use the cuter the owl gets.

PATTERN &amp; CUTTING CAUTION: Depending on how good you are at cutting fabric, some trimming adjustments might need to be made; especially the eyes and how close or far apart you put the rest of the body parts.  

It took me almost 2 hours from start to finish and this was being distracted by a movie, so add tea or wine and it could be a fun project one night with your friends (or kids).  

Edit: Just had an idea. If you have a class of kids you could use felt for everything and let the kids make a homemade ornament (depending on age, you might have to cut the patterns out yourself). Might not be as cute as the stuffed one, but a different project besides the popsicle stick Christmas tree ornament.",,False,self,t5_2s3yk,True,,,True,t3_mv3j2,http://www.reddit.com/r/craftit/comments/mv3j2/owl_ornament_pattern_plus_tips/,

It doesn't matter how weird or ""bad"" some people may think it is, if the creator is proud enough to show it off they deserve a pat on the back!

It must have slipped into my laundry basket yesterday because when I pulled my clothes out of the dryer this fuzzy purple mess plopped out. I was really sad because it was really soft and wonderful and alpaca yarn isn't cheap around here, especially chunky yarn.

I got the original idea from Martha Stewart [here](http://www.marthastewart.com/264331/washcloth-puppets) and adapted from there.  These are very easy (I had never embroidered before and hand-sewed everything) and only take a couple of hours.  I'm pretty proud- I tested the frog with my own daughter and got her giggly seal of approval.


Adaptations:

1) I flipped mine inside out to hide my horrible stitching.  Martha did not.  Make them a little bigger if you plan to do this.

2) Martha says to only glue the felt on (like the eye patch), but I didn't feel like that would hold up to getting wet, so I blanket-stitched around the edges.  I think it looks much more interesting that way.",,False,self,t5_2s3yk,True,,,True,t3_ncp6z,http://www.reddit.com/r/craftit/comments/ncp6z/washcloth_puppets_great_for_beginners/,

More or less what I'm looking for is a wrap-cloak style essentially like this, http://static.tvtome.com/images/genie_images/story/2012_usa/s/spartacus_veng_s1e2c_story.jpg . I'm not trying to copy Spartacus but essentially I want to have a raggedy looking cloak that isn't a poncho but doesn't look like I've just wrapped a blanket around myself. (Likely achieved by excess cloth forcing it to bunch up, simple enough?)

Though my issue arrives when, even if I simply did want to wrap a broad piece of cloth around me and clasp it at the neck, I can't purchase a whole piece of cloth that's wide enough. I'm a larger broader male and unexperienced with ordering exceedingly broad whole pieces of cloth or how to go about sewing two together without making it notable. 

Any advice? 

Greatly appreciated, please don't upvote, I don't expect much but I'm desperate for information at this point. ",,False,self,t5_2s3yk,False,,,True,t3_1fow38,http://www.reddit.com/r/craftit/comments/1fow38/worncloak_poor_warrior_costuming_just_a_little/,

&gt;Pay it Forward 2011: I promise to send something handmade to the first 5 people who leave a comment. They must in turn post this and send something they made to the first 5 people who comment on their status. The rules are that it must be handmade by you and it must be sent to your 5 people sometime in 2011.

Resulting in no one wanting to participate.

**Lets do it here!!** Post a comment below to join. The first 5 people to comment in response to your first comment will be your ""5"". If you can't commit to 5, say so in your comment. PM and arrange to send addresses.

Reply to others who want to make things. EDIT: If you reply, please be sure to join by commenting as well. This is an exchange, so lets reciprocate!

This project will only be as good as its participants, just like other exchanges, please only commit if you are serious. Handmade projects can be as simple or as complicated as you want. Any craft of your choice, but must be made by you! Drawing, painting, sewing, weaving, jewelry, knitting, crochet, embroidery, cross stitch, greeting cards, origami, papercraft, hook-rug, decoupage, clay, ceramics, shrinky-dinks, soap, candles, baked goods, …etc. up to you!

Since I was going to keep my first, I needed to make a replacement. [The second blanket](http://i.imgur.com/s7Zio.jpg) turned out just as wonderful! ([close up of squares](http://i.imgur.com/qYWaU.jpg)) ([close up of the letter](http://i.imgur.com/uRnym.jpg)...it's a little wonky, but hey, it's only my first lettered blanket ever)

I couldn't be more pleased with how they turned out. I'm currently working on one for baby girl ""P"", and I'm really excited to see how this one turns out. Then it's on to one for baby boy ""B"". I'm really looking forward to that one too!",,False,self,t5_2s3yk,False,,,True,t3_ljf5f,http://www.reddit.com/r/craftit/comments/ljf5f/so_i_decided_to_try_my_hand_at_making_baby/,

While lying there in bed I had the Little Mermaid song Part of Your World stuck in my head, and that if you changed a few words around you could probably make the entire song about someone's sewing room. I mean, just look at the first few lines:

Look at this stuff

Isn't it neat?

Wouldn't you think my collection's complete?

Wouldn't you think I'm the girl

The girl who has everything?

Look at this trove

Treasures untold

How many wonders can one cavern hold?

Looking around here you think

Sure, she's got everything

I've got gadgets and gizmos a-plenty

I've got whozits and whatzits galore

You want thingamabobs?

I've got twenty!

But who cares?

No big deal

I want more.

I am working with 8-12 year old kids from a very low socioeconomic area who have emotional disturbances and I am required by the Department of Mental Health to have them do an arts and crafts project every day!  

I am having a hard time thinking up stuff that appeals to their wannabe badass attitude while also taking into account their low skill/patience level and my need to justify what Im doing to my boss.  For example, today I am having them write their therapuetic goals in graffiti lettering using tracing paper and graffiti alphabets I printed out.

edit: thanks for all the amazing ideas! In answer to the questions several of you had I have 7 kids and no staff but I could get an assistant once in a while. My budget is flexible but in general only a few dollars per project with an expensive project every once in a while

if I end up using any I will make sure to post them.",,False,self,t5_2s3yk,True,,,True,t3_sgc7j,http://www.reddit.com/r/craftit/comments/sgc7j/craft_ideas_for_urban_kids/,

Chopping board,21Celcius,23,3,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/craftit/comments/f1z6o/woodwork_is_craft_too_right_chopping_board/,"I spent my holidays at my fathers house where he has all of these lovely power tools that I don't have at home so I made the most of it.

Since I can't afford to buy those super expensive chopping boards I made one myself.

First I asked a cabinet maker for some hardwood scraps (yay for free timber) and ended up getting Jarrah (red one), Silky Oak (Pink one, and in hindsight this is a bit too soft but seems to be holding up fine to the knife), Norfolk Pine (in the middle) and African Olive (Lovely grain and my fav!)

http://imgur.com/da8yZ
I lined them up and used a metric ton of wood glue and clamped them tight, and then left them for 36 hours (as it was humid and damp). 

Looking terrible (cute) with my ear and eye protection, safety first.
http://imgur.com/IqM4f

Once they were dry I used a drop saw and cleaned up the edges so they were straight. Then hard/rough sandpaper and sanded the top and base down smooth and flat. It's really easy to accidentally put dishy parts in it if you don't keep the sander flat and going with the grain. Follow this up with medium and smooth, when using smooth get a damp cloth and rub the timber down as it makes you be able to see all those tiny scratches that can then be smoothed out.

After this was all done I used a router to route the edges nicely and oiled it up which is why it's so shiny. The super shine goes as the oil is soaked up.

http://imgur.com/8B67u

Since I can't be happy with just any old chopping board I took the dremel and cleaned out a rectangle and used a chisel to take out a rectangle to place some glass in. We took a bombay gin bottle, used a tile/brick saw and trickled water over the glass as we cut it. There is a lady on the island who has a laser cutter so I went down to her and had my name cut into the blue glass.

THEN I dropped the god forsaken bit of glass after I'd cut the hole out.... Thankfully we drink a lot of gin and had another bottle which I could cut.
http://imgur.com/m5HfD

Final product in my messy kitchen, the only thing I'd change is that the laser etching isn't very easy to read and I should have gotten it engraved then filled it with a black enamel or something. And that mark is just flour from making pasta

Hi everyone. I actually posted here awhile back for the [MIB3](http://www.reddit.com/r/craftit/comments/s0vss/hi_craftit_my_job_is_starting_a_huge_men_in_black/) promotion. (Unfortunately, we didn't win on that one, though we got an 'honorable mention' for our efforts.)

Now we are running a promotion for Wreck it Ralph, and I have to say I am SO excited for this movie. All the video game cameos aside, the movie actually looks like it will be a halfway decent storyline.

**Anywho, here are some of the things I've been working on:**

* A mini Piranha Plant with three 'buds'. (Finished)
* Two medium-sized Piranha Plants. (I need help with this one. x x)
* Two large Piranha Plants. (Started one)
* One Mario Window Painting (Finished)
* One Donkey Kong Window Painting (Finished)
* One Street Fighter Window Painting (Drawn out, not painted yet.)
* One Walking Dead Window Painting (Drawn out, not painted yet.)
* One Large Skulltula (Halfway finished)

[**(Added some stuff to the album)**](http://imgur.com/a/B7p3f)

**Here are the things I still want to do:**

* One Medium Skulltula
* Three tiny Skulltulas
* Ten Rupees
* Five Mario Coins
* Five Sonic Rings
* Two Sugar Rush murals
* A crap-ton of sugar Rush themed landscape items
* Some Sugar Rush themed racing cars.

I have a lot going here already, and I have until the opening weekend of the movie, which is November fourteenth. A coworker of mine is working on cardboard cutouts of the Sugar Rush characters. I also still want to make Cy-bug sculptures as well, but I'm having issues with that.

~~Which brings me to one of the problems I'm facing. The piranha plants. The teeth are kind of big, but not problem once I put the gums on. However, I don't know how to do the lips. I've tried seeing how rolled up cloth looks, paper mache, even toilet paper tubes. Nothing seems to really fit, and I'm so stuck on it. Does anyone have any advice on these?~~  I used saran wrap with hot glue! So far it's working pretty well. I've yet to see how paint adheres to it though. Hopefully. 

Also, any advice, tips, tricks, or general insight anyone wants to share with me on how to go about making any of this other stuff in roughly a month's time.. I'd be very interested and appreciative in hearing what you have to say. I'm kind of overwhelmed at the moment, but still trying to push forward!

I recently discovered that there are macaron pillows in Japan!  I would like one so much, but the shipping cost alone is enough to scare me away.  So I figure why not make one myself.  While looking at these macaron pictures there is a specific type of fabric that they are using for the foot of the macaron cookie, the really fluffy looking stuff.  Does anyone know what kind of fabric this is?  I'm guessing that the cookie itself is a minky, correct me if I'm wrong.  Here are some pictures.

-Quilting: This is my top option right now. I would piece together the green and yellow and hand-sew the center circle and details. I am a bit worried about how this will hold up with time though. 
-Felt: I would just hand stitch everything together. I am really worried that this would fall apart easily though. Does anyone have any experience with felt on a book of some sort?
-Paper, and then laminate over it: This is probably my last choice because I feel like it would look really cheap. 

Anyone have any ideas or experience?

I am about to dive into the world of creating men's jewelry out of metal.  Looks like I need to learn about belt buckles now.  

I am not a guy, I don't wear belts, so my lack of knowledge on the subject is pretty embarrassing.

So far, every decorative belt buckle I've seen has the same thing in common for the back design: a clasp or loop where you attach the belt material and a prong for fastening the belt.  Which means the belt itself is permanently married to the decorative buckle.  That seems to be the normal thing.

Here's what mystifies me:  one would think that a guy would like to have a decorative belt buckle attachment/cover decorative deal which is designed not to be permanently attached to the belt, but instead to clip onto your everyday, ordinary-use rectangular belt buckle.  

That way he could switch out the decorative element at will and attach it to his existing different belts, depending on his whim for the day.  The ""buckle"" - rather the decorative element which covers the existing belt buckle - is interchangeable with many of the belts he already has.  The decorative element is designed to not permanently ""married"" to any one belt.   You can attach it to any existing, non-decorative, rectangular buckle.

Now this idea seems just plain OBVIOUS to me.  The design for attaching the decorative element to the existing, plain rectangular buckle seems just plain obvious to me too.  It's easy to put on, easy to keep in place without slipping, lasts forever and is easy to remove.

So I am boggled when I go looking for some kind of decorative belt buckle which is blank inside (for adding your artistic touch) which is designed to do accomplish exactly what I just described.  It's like the idea doesn't exist.

Is it true that the idea of attaching a decorative element to an existing, plain, square or rectangular belt buckle simply is not a common thing in the men's clothing world?  Does it already exist as a common design which I simply can't find because I don't know the name of the darn thing, or something?

Or is it just accepted that all decorative belt buckles are to be designed to be permanently ""married"" to an existing belt?

I've seen belt buckle clips that clip onto a belt,  but not one that is designed to turn an ordinary belt buckle into a fancy decorative piece which anyone can change out at will.

Am I in need of new knowledge of men's fashion... or have I accidentally come up with some kind of inventive new concept?

Thank you very much for your help, advice and patience in advance.  :)

I'm a pretty accomplished stitcher, so I decided to try a new challenge - cross stitching a blanket for my daughter. Since I've never done apparel before, and it's a HUGE project (16 75x75 patches with completely colored backgrounds), I'm concerned about threads coming loose with use. Any tips on how to help keep that from happening? I don't really want to back the entire thing, since it's lightweight. I was thinking of possibly using a very light iron on interfacing on the back of each patch.  Any advice would be welcome!

EDIT:  Thanks for the advice!  I think what I'm going to do, since this is a superhero logo blanket, is get some of the lightweight flannel in a DC print, and get one piece big enough to cover the entire back.  :)
