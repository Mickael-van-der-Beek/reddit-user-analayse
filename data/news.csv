**PART II THREAD w/ latest updates:** http://www.reddit.com/r/DornerCase/comments/1867zr/dornercase_timeline_part_ii_started_friday_8/

Suspect: [Christopher Dorner](http://i.imgur.com/PpKWcTi.jpg) - Former LAPD officer and Naval lieutenant. Trained sniper, proficient in numerous tactics, firearms and police procedures. He has ""declared war"" on the LAPD and is a fugitive from justice as of 11:30PM this evening. Anonymous 24/7 Tip Line: 877-LAPD-247 or 1-800-222-TIPS

TIMELINE: 

* **Sunday Feb. 3rd:** Suspect wanted in connection with [murder of two people](http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2013/02/04/man-woman-found-dead-inside-car-in-irvine-parking-structure/) in Irvine, CA. Woman was daughter of retired police Captain who reportedly represented the suspect in his termination hearing from the LAPD. The other victim was her fiance. Suspect was employed from 2005 to 2008 with the LAPD and was fired in early 2009 for ""allegedly lying about actions of a fellow officer"" he reported for excessive force.

* **Last few days:** Suspect posted his [11,000 word manifesto](http://ktla.com/2013/02/07/read-christopher-dorners-so-called-manifesto/#axzz2KI4SJAo8) [[another version](http://laist.com/2013/02/07/christopher_dorners_manifesto_in_fu.php), some are edited] to Facebook. Suspect's ""target"" list seems to be centered around 12 [now 11] people though ~40 names were mentioned. Please respect these people and their names and don't post information if you find the uncensored version.

* **Tue/Wed:** Spotted near San Diego at the Loma Lake base which was locked down and reopened. It has been confirmed he stayed at a hotel near the base on Tuesday, checking out Wednesday. *Source - KCAL9 News*

* **Wed. (10:00 PM):** Suspect allegedly tied up an 81-year old man and attempted to steal his boat but was unable to operate it. Suspect's wallet and a detective badge were found nearby. State-wide alert goes out via California Highway Patrol. *Source - ABC7 News*

* **Thu. (~1:25 AM):** Corona, CA - Citizen notified police that were protecting one of the suspect's targets of a truck that fit description. Upon following it, one officer was injured when the suspect fired at them grazing his forehead. They were not able to give chase. *Source - KCAL9 News*

* **Thu. (~1:45 AM):** Riverside, CA - Just minutes later about 5 miles away, two officers sitting at a red light had the suspect walk up and open fire. One officer (trainer) is killed, the other (trainee) is injured but expected to recover. [Source.](http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2013/02/07/massive-manhunt-underway-for-ex-cop-after-riverside-police-officer-fatally-shot/) - CBS.

* **Thu. (5:15AM):** Torrance, CA - A patrol unit assigned to protect a different target misidentified the blue truck with the two women delivering newspapers. Reportedly the headlights were off and officers opened fire in rapid bursts, a brief pause and then more bursts (according to witnesses). No details known if they identified themselves first. Both women were hit, one twice in the back and one in the arm. Both are expected to recover. [Source.](http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2013/02/torrance-shootings.html) - LA Times.

* **Thu. (5:20 AM):** A few blocks from the first mistaken-identity shooting, police were responding to the shots fired call and came across another similar truck to the suspect's. There was a collision to the rear of the vehicle and police fired three shots (at least) into the windshield. The driver was luckily uninjured and not involved. [Source.](http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2013/02/torrance-shootings.html) *Source - LA Times*

* **Thu. (1:41 PM):** Big Bear, CA - A burned-out truck matching the description of a getaway vehicle owned by triple-murder suspect was found in the San Bernardino mountains. [edit: CONFIRMED to be his truck]. *Source - KCAL9 News*

* **Thu. (~4:00 PM):** Large tactical operation going on in the San Bernardino Mountains north of LA (Big Bear) involving SWAT and other agencies as they scan the area. Agencies have now demanded air news teams not show the search locations, which two local news organizations called an ""unusual request"", despite the logic behind it. *Source - KCAL9 News*

* **Thu. 5:15PM:** Suspect [mailed a package to CNN's Anderson Cooper](http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-manhunt-anderson-cooper-got-package-from-fugitive-20130207,0,6906979.story) who confirmed via Twitter. The package contained a note, DVD and a coin that had been shot through with bullet holes in it. *Source - LA Times.*

* **Thu. 5:35 PM:** Tracks found leading away from the burned out vehicle in Big Bear but no suspect has been found. Tracking dogs, air resources (with FLIR night vision) and ~125 Law Enforcement officers are in the area doing door to door searches. *Source - press conference.*

* **Thu. 5:40 PM**: Suspect called himself a ""top shot"" Sharpshooter. The Navy has three levels of proficiency [edit: above the *base* qualification that is]. These are Marksman -&gt; Sharpshooter -&gt; Expert as the top level. Reportedly he's listed as a Marksman with rifles (lowest level) but he's listed as an Expert (highest level) with a 9mm pistol. *Source - CNN's Anderson Cooper.*

* **Thu. 5:55 PM**: Suspect's recent history - Appeal to get his job back was denied in 2011, upholding original decision back in 2008 to fire him. In 2007, he had reported a fellow officer for excessive force on Mr. Christopher Gettler. In his statement, he said that ""she stood up and kicked Gettler twice in the left clavicle. And then...kicked him on the left cheek, causing him to start bleeding"". It was later reported Mr. Gettler was schizophrenic and that Dorner filed the complaint about his fellow officer two weeks later. His allegation was denied by the female officer, the claim was classified as ""Unfounded"", he was charged with ""making false statements"" and officially fired in early 2009. In December 2012, he defaulted on his home in Las Vegas and just days ago his Naval Reserve career was terminated [edit: honorable dischage]. *Source - ABC7 News.*

* **Thu. 6:00 PM**: Suspect's home near Las Vegas is surrounded but empty. The search area is covering all of California and parts of Nevada at this point. Other areas heavily involved in California are Corona, Riverside, Irvine and Big Bear Lake. Big Bear ski resort and schools around the various incidents have been closed. *Source - ABC7 Los Angeles.*

* **Thu. 8:20 PM**: FBI finishing up at his Las Vegas home, FAA completely restricting airspace above search and the coin mailed to CNN's Anderson Cooper was a ""Challenge Coin"" given to him by his former boss LAPD Police Chief William Bratton.

* **Thu. 8:30 PM**: Pictures of the items mailed to Anderson Cooper. The [challenge coin](http://i.imgur.com/hlqr4yv.jpg) and [DVD.](http://i.imgur.com/wlf47to.jpg)  

* **Thu. 9:05 PM**: Written on duct tape that the coin was wrapped in is ""Thanks but no thanks Will Bratton"" as well as ""1 M.O.A."" [edit: per user /u/November_Bravo ""1 Minute of Angle, in shooting terms this means being accurate enough to shoot a ~1"" group at 100 yards""]. The video is apparently of Mr. Getter's interview after the event. He is the schizophrenic man Dorner claimed was a victim of excessive force. Getter's testimony supposedly confirms Dorner's complaint to his superiors but nothing has been shown to the public to confirm this. [Source](http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2013/02/former-cop-seeks-vindication-in-package-sent-to-anderson-cooper.html) - LA Times.

* **Thu. 9:15 PM**: Press conference - ~400 homes expected to be checked this evening. No sightings or signs of him outside of the last tracks in Big bear in the snow/mud. No new tracks of a second vehicle near the original burned out vehicle. Schools and ski resort are opening back up, implying the area around Big Bear is relatively clear but search is ongoing in poor weather conditions. Aerial support is still flying, two SB County helicopters and one LA County chopper all of which with F.L.I.R. infrared/night vision technology. *Source - KCAL9 News*

* **Thu. 9:40 PM**: KCAL9 reporting multiple news sources received letters/DVDs from the suspect. Only Anderson Cooper got the coin, reportedly.

6:43 AM EDT - [Link to Website](http://louieck.com/)

Received this email from info@louisck.com Monday, June 25th @ 7:10 PM:
- - - - -

hello folks!  I'm going on tour this  year from October through
Feb.  I'll be all over the goddamn place.  This year, I'm trying
something new, building on the fun, success and fan-benifit of
selling my content online.  We are selling tickets to this tour
exclusively here on louisck.com.  I only wanted to do this if
there was a way, like with LIVE AT THE BEACON, that  it could
bring the price of tickets down and make them easier and less
complicated to buy.  We figured out a way.

Making my shows affordable has always been my goal but two things
have always worked against that.  High ticket charges and ticket
re-sellers marking up the prices.  Some ticketing services charge
more than 40% over the ticket price and, ironically, the lower
I've made my ticket prices, the more scalpers have bought them
up, so the more fans have paid for a lot of my tickets.

By selling the tickets exclusively on my site, I've cut the
ticket charges way down and absorbed them into the ticket price.
To buy a ticket, you join NOTHING.  Just use your credit card and
buy the damn thing.   opt in to the email list if you want, and
you'll only get emails from me.

Also, you'll see that if you try to sell the ticket anywhere for
anything above the original price, we have the right to cancel
your ticket (and refund your money).  this is something I intend
to enforce.  There are some other rules you may find annoying but
they are meant to prevent someone who has no intention of seeing
the show from buying the ticket and just flipping it for twice
the price from a thousand miles away.

Some of these rules may be a pain in your ass, but please be
patient.  My goal here is that people coming to see my shows are
able to pay a fair price and that they be paying just for a
ticket.  Not also paying an exhorbanant fee for the privalege of
buying a ticket.

Tickets across the board, everywhere, are 45 dollars.  That's
what you'll actually pay.  In every case, that will be less than
anyone has actually  paid to see me (after ticket charges)  in
about two years and in most cases it's about half of what you
paid last year.

The benifit for me is that I won't get angry emails from anyone
who paid a ton of money to see me due to circumstances out of my
control.  That makes me VERY happy.  The 45 dollars also includes
sales tax, which I'm paying for you.  So I'm making more or less
depending on the state.

Another benifit to me is also one to you.  I get your email
address (if you opt in) when you opt in.  You don't have to join
ANYTHING to buy these tickets and if you opt in, youll only hear
from me once in an old man's jizz-cycle.

Obviously  none of this means anything if the shows aren't good.
So that's up to me.  As I do every year, I'll be performing a
brand new hour (or more) on all of these shows.

Lastly, it was a real challenge to find venues around the country
that could work with our exclusive ticketing service under these
perameters.  It means I'm playing in very new places.  I really
appreciate all of these theaters that are letting us give this a
try.

Setting up this tour has been fascinating and difficult.  this
ticketing service is a brand new thing and I really fucking hope
it works and that there aren't any problems.  If anything comes
up, please be patient.

Doing things this way means I""m making less than I would have
made if I did a standard tour, using the usual very excellent but
expensive ticketing service.  In some cities I've had to play
smaller venues and do more shows.  But I like doing more shows
and about a year ago I reached a place where I realized I am
making enough money doing comedy so the next thing that
interested me is bringing your price down.  Either way, I still
make a whole lot more than my grandfather who taught math and
raised chickens in Michigan.

alright, that's it, folks.  I'll be sending this message out to
folks on the opt-in list and sending a separate email that lays
it out much more simply with the proper links.  I am doing this
because when I emailed you about LIVE AT CARNEGIE HALL, (which is
still on sale for 5 dollars!) about half of the people who got
the email really enjoyed the long, verbose, unedited message.
The other half HATED it and would have preffered a price, a link,
and me shutting the fuck up.

This way, you can read this if you like, or your can just see the
massive shit-ball of text and throw it in the garbage, and focus
on the simple email.

I hope to see you all on the road.

regards,

Louis C.K.",,False,,t5_2qh3l,1340709271.0,,,True,t3_vlkri,http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/vlkri/louie_ck_ditches_ticketmaster_sells_tickets/,

edit: Holy shit, this thread really hit it big. I've never seen so many replies in my redditing, thank you to everyone who replied and upvoted mine since it was first.

Alot of people asking what happened, and here's a short version. Here is the case as I understand it, anyone is free to correct me.

Zimmerman was neighborhood watch. He saw a young man in a hoodie and he thought that looked suspicious. He followed the young man, called for police assitance. The 911 dispatcher(in this case NOT a law enforcement officer) told Zimmerman he didn't need to follow him, he said okay. He went back to his car. Trayvon who was on his way back to his fathers house turned back around and attacked Zimmerman, and was bashing his head into the ground. Zimmerman reached for his firearm and fired. 

[One witness was Trayvons friend/girlfriend, who was on the phone with Trayvon. She was an awful witness, disrespectful, didn't care about Justice for Trayvon, couldn't read. She didn't even call the police when she found out he died.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mL1OFA7LPrY) 

[Another ""witness"" was a neighbor who called 911, but they really didn't see much and the main point of the evidence was so show yelling for help.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aVwPqXc-bk) Both Zimmermans and Trayvons mothers said that it was THEIR son they heard in the video.[Zimmermans mom saying its George](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRESVP9agJE)---------------[Martins mom saying it was Trayvons screams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6r9aiA30rE)

[Some character pictures of Trayvon]- broken for now.

[Zimmermans wounds](http://imgur.com/a/FJVBv)

In the end, there was only one witness who was actually there(Zimmerman), and no evidence of criminal activity. Lack of little evidence, Zimmermans wounds, the recordings they had meant that Zimmerman was found not guilty. Didn't mean he didn't play a part. He was being trialed for Murder 2, then they realized that wasn't happening they put manslaughter on the table, Zimmermans actions didn't meet that of manslaughter to the Jury, thus found not guilty. He wasn't even going to be trialed but a bunch of people(Media+others) threw into outrage that because a ""white man"" killed a black man.(Zimmerman is half Hispanic)


EditII: I originally had it posted that Stand Your Ground law was a part of the reason he got off, but I was wrong. SYG appears to relate to places where you can run and get away, but you have the right to stay there and if someone is a threat you can stay there and fight(or shoot) them.

Hey guys, I've been traveling around Europe this summer and have ended up in Cairo. I spent today 8/14 in Giza Nasser Elden trying to get an unbiased first hand account of what's going on.

http://m.imgur.com/a/kXjnf
http://imgur.com/a/cF5Yh#0

From the Giza metro station I heard automatic gunfire and saw a huge plume of black smoke off in the distance. When I arrived, the protest was already underway. Imagine a long street without any roads crossing it. On one end a couple high rises and the military. On the other end the protestors and a mosque that had been turned into a makeshift hospital.

I started taking pictures as soon as I arrived, being the only white guy I got a few strange looks, and some pretty angry faces. A few threatening protestors told me I couldn't take pictures and to leave immediately. A group of 15 or so protestors started to gather around me and a bunch of angry Arabic flew back and forth. So ya... maybe not the best idea?

Finally someone started speaking English to me! After explaining to the crowd I was there to record and tell they're story, they welcomed me into their family. They brought me a translator, water, anything I needed.

Throughout the day I interviewed several protestors. From what I could gather the protestors are actually a mix of Morsi supporters and opposers. Those who don't support Morsi are protesting against the military who ""take our vote and throws it in the trash"". While Morsi wasn't who THEY voted for, it was atleast who the Egyptian people voted for.

During the interviews, some told me that protestors had been burned inside of their tents in the camp raids earlier today. They said that Molotov cocktails were thrown into the makeshift hospitals, and estimates for the days fatalities ranged from 300-2000. Again, these are thins I was told, I didn't witness them.

Throughout the entire day I didn't see a single weapon amongst the protestors. Everyone had rocks, kids were prying files off building, women were smashing large pieces of concrete into smaller sizes. Everyone I met begged me to tell the world they were unarmed ciilians being fired on bu their military. However, I was warned by one person to ""not take pictures of protestors with weapons"". The group I was with immediately told me he was wrong, because the protestors aren't armed. So while I didn't see a single armed protestor or firing from the crowd, take it for what you will.

What I did witness, were the deaths of several people, and the damage done by the weapons of the military. Bullets cant tell age. I saw a kid, about 15 years old, missing half of his head. I'm no arms expert, but the protestors said he was shot by a sniper.

They explained that snipers were perched in the high rise and would target photographers/journalists (one was killed today). At one point five or so protestors created a human shield, to get me close enough to attempt a picture of the snipers firing on the crowd. Unfortunately my camera and lens are pretty amateur and the best I could get was an outline of a person on top of a building.

Towards the end of the day, the protestors were being pushed farther back towards the mosque. Tear gas was occasionally reaching the mosque. I didn't have my passport or any papers, incase I was arrested, plus the camera would have definitly been destroyed. I decided to leave.
On my way back I switched out SD cards and when I arrived at the metro station I photographed some of the military tanks. They grabbed me and took the camera. I told them I was just a tourist but they forced me to delete The photos anyways.

I tried to make it as unbiased as an account as I could. While I didn't know what I was going to do with these pictures, I did meet some amazing people today, risking their lives and dying for what they believe in. All they asked was for me to share their story.",,True,,t5_2qh3l,1376592678.0,,,True,t3_1kdig3,http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1kdig3/im_an_american_who_spent_all_day_photographing/,

**EDIT 202 1:31:**  It's basically been a lot of officers telling each other where they are going and general communication.  Nothing new.

**EDIT 201 1:30:**  Conference starting, link below.

**EDIT 200 1:26:**  Correspondent /u/potato_bus says another [press conference](http://www.myfoxboston.com/category/262392/boston-marathon) is coming up.

**EDIT 199 1:21:**  I have heard no updates on the old man with the dead switch or the location of White Hat.  I am only listening to the scanner but I do check messages for info.

**EDIT 198 1:20:**  Apparently the 'hostage' was frightened by a police officer with a gun.  

**EDIT 197 1:18:**  House with 'hostage' was clear.

**EDIT 196 1:17:**  They made sure the situation from 185/177 is definitely clear.

**EDIT 195 1:15:** ""Ambulance on the way to evaluate her.""

**EDIT 194 1:14:** People are telling me they said the hostage is safe.

**EDIT 193 1:11:** They are calling for an ambulance to swing by.  If something was said before it I missed it.

**EDIT 191 1:10:** A lot of garbled messages, SWAT is stepping in.

**EDIT 190 1:08:**  Front door opened, ""we have the message"".

**EDIT 189 1:07:**  Look if the hostage taker is reading reddit instead of listening to the scanner then he's screwing himself and we're helping the police.  

**EDIT 188 1:05:**  Attempting to contact hostage taker.

**EDIT 187 1:02:**  Possible house with hostage located.

**EDIT 186 1:00:**  Another suspicious package reported.

**EDIT 185 12:57:**  Situation from EDIT 177 is clear.

**EDIT 184 12:56:**  Possible hostage situation.

**EDIT 183 12:55:**  ""Everyone take cover.  No more units.""

**EDIT 182 12:55:**  ""A person is being held there by gunpoint.""

**EDIT 181 12:54:**  A man is trying to get through security but has no credentials.

**EDIT 180 12:53:**  Woman is being held by a man with a gun

**EDIT 179 12:53:**  Again, I don't know what the specifics of 173 are.  I'm not holding out.  They just started talking and then said 'we don't want this on the air' and then didn't talk about any specifics.

**EDIT 178 12:51:**  Reports are coming in that the White House situation room has been activated.  I'm looking up more now on that.

**EDIT 177 12:47:**  They are following up on another lead similar to the open basement.  Stuff has been moved since they last investigated the area.  (Look, do I think white hat is reading this instead of just listening to the scanner?  No, but i can be a little more vague when the detail doesn't matter.)

**EDIT 176 12:42:**  About EDIT 173, I don't really know what it is.  They aren't saying many details, they are checking on a vehicle, but other than that the only details are unit number and specific locations.  Which is exactly what they asked not be posted.  If something happens I'll post the aftermath.  And this is the first time they specifically said on the scanner not to mention something on the air.

**EDIT 175 12:40:**  They are checking on something but not being very descriptive.

**EDIT 174 12:38:**  There will be a controlled explosion in Cambridge later in the day as a precaution.

**EDIT 173 12:35:**  They just said something that they don't want on air.  Don't write a comment about it.

**EDIT 172 12:34:**  I'm still listening to the scanner and not the press conference so if anything new comes out in the conference please let me know.

**EDIT 171 12:33:**  EOD team being sent to another location.

**EDIT 170 12:29:**  /u/potato_bus posts link to upcoming [press conference](http://www.myfoxboston.com/category/262392/boston-marathon).  Police are very concerned about the security for the conference, or rather, making sure it is as secure as possible.

**EDIT 169 12:27:**  Open basement door that is being checked out.

**EDIT 168 12:24:**  /u/potato_bus said that MyFoxBoston is reporting that the helicopters are part of the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team (HRT), they are not military. 

**EDIT 167 12:22:**  CNN is confirming that the link is his twitter account: https://twitter.com/J_tsar/

**EDIT 166 12:17:**  /u/SolusLoqui posted a link to a [Guardian photo album](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gallery/2013/apr/19/boston-lockdown-best-photos-empty-streets#/?picture=407528614&amp;index=1) of Boston's deserted street.  Still waiting on press area to be cleared apparently.

**EDIT 165 12:15:**  As you've probably seen, military choppers have arrived.  Also news networks are reporting on the same twitter I linked.  I'm still leaving it down, but there are many cached pics of him.

**EDIT 164 12:13:**  Press conference should be sometime soon.

**EDIT 162 12:05:**  For those asking there have not been any recent updates on Suspect #2 (White Hat)

**EDIT 161 12:02:**  Suspect is ""clear"", safe for EMS to approach him.

**EDIT 160 12:01:** Numerous people from different areas have reported loss of power.  (Power outages were reportedly due to construction.)

**EDIT 159 12:00:**  /u/greenlep posted a different link to a ~~possible twitter~~ for Suspect #2 (White Hat).  Take it with a grain of salt, but looks more legit than the last one.  REMOVED  Cached profile pic was of Suspect #2 (White Hat) but it will stay removed until some source verifies it.

**EDIT 158 11:56:**  Still working on the old suspect, no updates on his status.

**EDIT 157 11:55:**  Apparently the ""jumper"" was not a person, but an area where a possible bomb may have been which explains why an EOD was sent to the location.

**EDIT 156 11:52:**  /u/riothedragonman lives near the area where the jumper was reported and says everyone has dispersed.

**EDIT 155 11:51:**  Someone asked, no update on hockey duffel bag drop off.  No update on jumper.

**EDIT 154 11:47:**  Four robots operating on the old man right now.  No word on device or explosive.

**EDIT 153 11:45:**  Press conference will begin soon, they are letting media with credentials enter the scene.

**EDIT 152 11:44:**  One area that was previously being investigated is clear.  Not the old man or jumper scene.

**EDIT 151 11:39:**  Second bearcat is arriving at the original scene with the old man.

**EDIT 150 11:35:**  They are doing police stuff that doesn't need to be reported.

**EDIT 149 11:30:**  An EOD team is being called to the overpass, no specifics.

**EDIT 148 11:28:**  Possible jumper on an overpass.

**EDIT 147 11:26:**  Because it keeps getting asked.  The suspect that is being searched by the EOD robots, that is handcuffed, that has the dead man switch, is a 60-70 yr old gray haired man.  He was specifically identified as having salt and pepper hair, even the age 90 was thrown out.  This is NOT White Hat aka Suspect #2

**EDIT 146 11:24:**  Investigating possible sighting of suspect #2 at different location.  (Most likely a false sighting, nothing else was said about this)

**EDIT 145 11:23:**  Unknown car has stopped within a security perimeter.

**EDIT 144 11:22:**  They said they need to bring in a second EOD robot and a second Bearcat (armored vehicle)

**EDIT 143 11:19:**  EOD robot is still clearing the suspect.  He will be interviewed after he is cleared.

**EDIT 142 11:18:**  Officials are supposed to give any update some time soon.

**EDIT 141 11:15:**  They are telling all non-SWAT to leave the area.

**EDIT 140 11:14:**  Subject definitely has some kind of device or switch in his hand.

**EDIT 139 11:11:**  EOD (explosive ordinance disposal) robot is attempting to remove the jacket from the man right now.

**EDIT 138 11:07:**  Been silent, EOD is on scene.

**EDIT 137 11:03:**  To further clarify, guy with the white hat has nothing to do with this (as far as we know).  He is still on the loose.  This suspect is an old man (60-70) with grey hair and appears to be holding a dead man switch.  

**EDIT 135 11:01:**  Negotiating with suspect (not white hat).

**EDIT 134 11:00:**  Apparently EDIT 126/128 was not clear.  This is not Suspect #2 aka White Hat.

**EDIT 133 10:59:**  Guessing they are still waiting on EOD.

**EDIT 132 10:53:**  ~~Hearing ""man down"" in the background, asking about another location.  Had two streams going and couldn't tell what was overlapping.~~  Not true.

**EDIT 132 10:52:** Making attempts to block a possible blast.

**EDIT 131 10:51:**  Suspect is shaking his head ""no"" and trying to arch his back up, speculating that he may be trying to do something with the device.

**EDIT 130 10:47:**  He has something in his right hand that he holding.  Last person had a dead man switch.  (If someone lets go of a dead man switch it triggers the mechanism)

**EDIT 129 10:46:**  Some people are saying they heard reports of a shot fired.

**EDIT 128 10:45:**  Waiting on EOD to move further.  Still no information on if the older man held at gunpoint has any relation to Boston Suspect #2.  Has anyone heard how they originally found him or if he approached officers?

**EDIT 127 10:44:** Suspect is being held at gunpoint and is in handcuffs.

**EDIT 126 10:40:** Waiting on mod position.  A different suspect may be found, may have transmitter on him.  They are being cautious, white male, 60-70 yrs old.  Brown jacket, device is in jacket.

**EDIT 125 10:39:**  It has been brought to my attention that the Boston PD has been asking that people do not post information from the scanner online.  As of now I will reduce updates only to information that either they want people to know (like the CRV info) or that can not compromise them at all.  Or stuff that is already on national news, like the man being held at gunpoint.

**EDIT 124 10:25:**  Some guy just dropped a hockey duffle bag by ""Save the Harbor Save the Bay"" and left, they are looking for him.

**EDIT 123 10:24:**  You can [stream this post](http://reddit-stream.com/comments/1codv1/) to reduce the load on reddit.  Updated to new post.

**EDIT 122 10:22:**  Looking at a red Crown Victoria now.

**EDIT 121 10:20:**  CRV was apparently found empty.

**EDIT 120 10:18:**  They say they have or have seen some possible suspects who look Russian.  ""We have him with us.""  Not entirely sure the specific.  I don't think it's the actual suspect, they were being too casual about it.

**EDIT 119 10:15:** Still looking for 1999 Grey Honda CRV License # 316 ES9 (thanks, sleepy dyslexia kicking in).  Suspect is believed to be driving/in the vehicle.

**EDIT 118 10:13:**  Pretty slow going right now.  Just making sure everything is in order.

**EDIT 117 10:07:**  Found a .40 caliber round casing.  Said it was in ""pristine condition.""  Found some distance from shootouts, said it looked like it might be one of theirs.

**EDIT 116 10:06:**  Whew, start of hour 4...

**EDIT 317: 7:31PM** Want to keep updating everyone each minute.  Still radio silence.  Completely dead on the radio.  
**EDIT 316: 7:30PM** Two choppers in the air (according to whatever news station I have on TV - NOT THE SCANNER) with infrared cameras.  
**EDIT 315: 7:29PM** Still mumblings about dogs and weapons, no brand new information.  Still attempting radio silence for the TAC squads.  
**EDIT 314: 7:28PM** Suspect is in the boat and he has a wire fence behind him.  Trying to decipher chatter here as quickly as I can.  Sorry if I miss something.  
**EDIT 313: 7:27PM** One friendly is ""a little too close"" to the boat.  Asking them to leave.  
**EDIT 312: 7:26PM** ""Suspect prone""  Not sure if I heard that right.  There is still movement in the back of the boat.  
**EDIT 311: 7:26PM** They are attempting to come up with an official dog to track down the suspect in case he gets out of the boat.  FBI dog versus BPD dog?  I pick the FBI dog.  
**EDIT 310: 7:25PM** Tactical folk trying to get up on a wall for either entry or line of sight.  They have a K9 unit on hand as well.  
**EDIT 309: 7:23PM** ""Clear the air.  Let's maintain radio silence.""  ""OK boss, we're in the house.""  
**EDIT 308: 7:22PM** ""Keep going dispatch, you guys are doing a great job.""  
**EDIT 307: 7:22PM** All non-tactical policemen are asked to leave the area.  Those with the best weapons are in place and they want them to have the best view of the incident.  
**EDIT 306: 7:21PM** [This post](http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1cpb55/live_boston_update_thread_part_7/c9ir3y9) filled in while I was gone.  THANK YOU!  
**EDIT 286: 7:19PM** The backyard has been cleared of all officers and civilians in case of crossfire.  Apparent standoff situation - will continue to update quickly.  The scanner is very busy.  
**EDIT 285: 7:17PM** If the boat is in fact opened, officers are to be wary of crossfire.  EMS is being called.  Passerbys are advising multiple people are running.  Unsure if they are civilian or not.
**EDIT 284: 7:16PM** All non-essential officers are being asked to set up a perimeter.  They are ripping off something...not sure what.  I think he is hiding in a boat.
**EDIT 283: 7:16PM** Garage is clear.  I have a scanner up and I will update by the moment from here on out until the conclusion.  
**EDIT 282: 7:15PM** Shots fired.  Suspect possibly down.  Ambulance being backed in.  ""All police officers form all commands in the rear of that white garage behind the house need to move.  You are in the line of fire.""   
**EDIT 281: 7:14PM** Stupid traffic...sorry guys.  Police and FBI have tracked down a car. Shots fired at 7:09.  EOD on scene.
**EDIT 280: 6:49PM** Since the scanners aren't working for me here at work, I'm going to go rush home and see if I can get them back up there.  10-15 minutes, I promise.  
**EDIT 279: 6:46PM** Reports of a suspect in custody.  No description, name, location, or anything else.  I can not even hint at it being the primary suspect.  
**EDIT 278: 6:45PM** I have been sent a recording of the potential high speed chase by /u/That_Urks_Me and it seems as plausible as the other scanner audio I have found.  Thank you to everyone that has sent me scanner links, I think I have one that is working for now.
**EDIT 277: 6:42PM** Mention of a possible runner.  (This was potentially of a recorded audio - apologies)  
**EDIT 276: 6:40PM** Unconfirmed reports of high speed chase matching a vehicle description.  My scanners are all down so I think it's a good time for me to run home and find a new one.  Staying for a little while longer in case something happens.  
**EDIT 275: 6:37PM** Delayed edit from 6:32 from /u/extrasweettea ""Male on bike wearing all black with curly hair seen on bike going towards central square with large backpack.. Units deployed.""  
**EDIT 274: 6:34PM** My scanner went down so I'm looking for a new one.  **PLEASE REFRAIN FROM POSTING SCANNER LINKS.** Also, I will be heading home soon from work so I will be out of updates for about 15 minutes.  I will let you know when I leave and when I get back  
**EDIT 273: 6:28PM** More questions about civilians entering the streets and how to handle the situation.  Questions about traffic patterns and allowable areas are being discussed.  
**EDIT 272: 6:24PM** Possible sighting of the suspect in **[REDACTED]**.  Police are sending units to investigate.  
**EDIT 271: 6:23PM** Police on **[REDACTED]** street say that federal agents and other agencies are falling back and the perimeter is getting sparse.  
**EDIT 270: 6:18PM** Delayed edit from 6:12 from /u/extrasweettea ""Vehicle was left with clerk after being given $20 to park it in unknown parking lot. Was told someone would come by at 10 to pick it up. No keys were left.""  
**EDIT 269: 6:16PM** Suspicious knapsack found.  EOD requested.  Unsure of location but I believe Watertown.  
**EDIT 268: 6:15PM** Police are seeing people leaving their houses and requesting how to act.  Police recommended to stand down and continue breaking down the perimeter but stay on alert.  
**EDIT 267: 6:13PM** Breaking down the perimeter.  Police are asked to stand down (in shifts) and head back to the staging area for rest and debriefing.  
**EDIT 266: 6:10PM** Public transit is back open and the ""stay indoors request"" has been lifted.

MOVING OVER HERE BECAUSE THIS IS GETTING LAGGY AND I DON'T WANT TO MESS IT UP AGAIN.


**EDIT 362: 8:33PM** Please continue to keep the comments slow or stop them completely.  It will help this page load quicker.  Officers discussing tactical movements that I will again not discuss.  
**EDIT 361: 8:30PM** I am currently on the Rt.9 scanner (NO LINKS PLEASE) and looking at the Eastern Mass scanner.  'H4' apparently is apparently the Boston based command post.  
**EDIT 360: 8:29PM** An ambulance is blocking something, EMS is coming to move it.  New scanner is still trying to load so I'll keep it going.  Asked again to keep chatter to a minimum.  The scene sounds tense, but under control.  
**EDIT 359: 8:26PM** Officers asking for cold water.  I'm looking at a new scanner right now so we'll see if that is more active.  
**EDIT 358: 8:25PM** Police told to stay at their post until 2100.  Not sure what will happen at 9:00PM but they will fall back to ""H4""  
**EDIT 357: 8:23PM** Chatter about a larger perimeter perhaps beyond the smaller one.  Talking about offramps and highway codes.  
**EDIT 356: 8:22PM** I am still on the BPD scanner, and it is quiet on that end.  More open mic comments.  
**EDIT 355: 8:19PM** Still see imaging in the boat - from what I heard a bit ago but wanted to update.  Suspect is still in the boat.  TV broadcast speculating he's been in the boat for quite some time.  
**EDIT 354: 8:19PM** People jumping over the gate in the back.  Possibly officers, assuming tactical squad.  Not a lot of background on that statement to give.   
**EDIT 353: 8:16PM** Apparently the downlink is the video - not the scanner.  I am just writing what I hear as quickly as possible and not filtering what I hear.  There are officers looking for help with keeping the population off the streets.  
**EDIT 352: 8:15PM** Asking for a new, tighter perimeter to be placed.  Discussing street names and a large media contingent.  I will not post street names but they are closing the box around the house.  
**EDIT 351: 8:14PM** The BPD is talking about how the downlink is being thrown on the internet.  They might shut it down.  They are concerned about it being broadcast and are possibly moving channels.  Once more pass with the chopper before it refuels.  
**EDIT 350: 8:13PM** Possibly the main issue with the sun moving to the boat is that it is on the helicopter.  
**EDIT 349: 8:11PM** The main issue with the boat seems to be the fuel on board.  They are not sure if the suspect has anything flammable on him that can ignite the fuel onboard.  More discussion about tactical movements that I will not discuss.  
**EDIT 348: 8:10PM** Another request to put the ""night sun"" on the boat.  Still met with some resistance.  
**EDIT 347: 8:09PM** Still discussing safety issues with lighting up the boat.  Also, I get it, I'm an idiot for the flameless paper.  I don't need another 100 people telling me, I already read the first 75.  
**EDIT 346: 8:08PM** ""The FBI would like you to put the sun on the boat.  Take all precautions if you can't do it.""  ""OK Standby""  
**EDIT 345: 8:07PM** ""Can you light up the boat?""  ""That is a negative sir, that will give away our location.""  ""Light up the boat!""  ""We cannot sir, we cannot.""  
**EDIT 344: 8:05PM** ""We have movement.  Arms are moving.  Repeat, we have movement.""  Requesting flood light assistance now from the side.  Unsure what changed.  
**EDIT 343: 8:04PM** I've been told by everyone that it's flameless OC paper, like tear gas I guess.  That seems to be the consensus...apparently I'm typing too quickly here.  
**EDIT 342: 8:03PM** I want to apologize again for the mixup between thread 7 and thread 8.  There is still little talk over the radio.  Apparently it's freaking snowing outside my window...GO HOME CHICAGO WEATHER! YOU'RE DRUNK!  Really...no radio chatter on my feed.  
**EDIT 341: 8:02PM** ATF is negotiating with someone, unsure about what.  First mention I've heard of ATF all evening.  
**EDIT 340: 7:59PM** Talking about flameless copy paper?  No idea why...maybe they're trying to refill their cash register.  Humor over and out.  Still nothing new to report.  Asking about TAC communication with the FBI.  
**EDIT 339: 7:59PM** Asking how the long rifles are holding up.  First mention of potential sniper cover.  Can't confirm, but it seems a part of the TAC squad.  
**EDIT 338: 7:58PM** Still negative movement.  Suspect on his back in the boat without movement.  
**EDIT 337: 7:57PM** Discussing a changeover for something.  Potentially the chopper or possibly the TAC squads.  Unsure at the moment - will update with info.  
**EDIT 336: 7:56PM** No further movement.  News stations reporting blood on the boat.  Nothing about blood on the scanner.  
**EDIT 335: 7:56PM** Officers asked to shut off lights on cruisers.  Unsure why.  They're slowly being shut down.  Still no movement.  No more flashbangs or shots fired at the moment.  
**EDIT 334: 7:55PM** Discussion of a plan.  Plan not mentioned over scanner.  Using codes and allusions to talk about the plan.  
**EDIT 333: 7:54PM** All quiet on the scanner.  
**EDIT 332: 7:53PM** Negative on the fire confirmed by the chopper.  Still no movement from the top.  
**EDIT 331: 7:52PM** Negative on the fire on the boat.  From tactical vantage point, no fire on the boat.  negative on movement, another flashbang requested.  
**EDIT 330: 7:52PM** News outlets reporting ""pop pop"" noises.  Those would be the flashbangs.  Inquiry about the fire on the boat has been posted.  Awaiting a response.  
**EDIT 329: 7:50PM** Flash bang hit forward of the subject.  No movement from the subject by confirmed hit of flashbang.  
**EDIT 328: 7:50PM** Still radio silence.  Fire on the boat appears to be confirmed by scanner, still unsure.  Also, I have a working scanner everyone...thanks for the messages though but they slow my load time.  **FLASHBANGS OUT**  
**EDIT 327: 7:49PM** Boston BEARCAT asked to back up as they need access to something.  Not sure what.  
**EDIT 326: 7:48PM** All units asked for radio silence once more.  Told to not return fire as another flash bang is being fired into the center of the boat.  (Sorry again for the mess up with threads everyone)  
**EDIT 325: 7:46PM** FBI shooting off a flashbang.  Everyone told DO NOT RETURN FIRE.  
**EDIT 324: 7:45PM** Possible fire on the boat.  Unsure of the origin but there is a possible fire on the boat.  There is a tac team with a Bearcat waiting to move in but there are currently conflicting plans.  
**EDIT 323: 7:44PM** Sorry for the confusion.  I got locked out of /r/news for a little bit.  ""We do NOT want to light up the boat.  Not lights on the boat please.""  
**EDIT 322: 7:43PM** He is on the boat.  Center mass is leaned towards the fence line.  He is inside the stern - or maybe the gastank is inside the stern.  Half full tank with 20 gallons of fuel.  Unsure if the suspect is trying to get to it.  
**EDIT 321: 7:42PM** Confirmed movement in the boat from multiple sources.  Confirmed movement in the boat.  
**EDIT 320: 7:40PM** There is a full tank on the boat.  20 gallons of fuel on the boat.  Helicopters overhead say there is movement in the boat.  Asking for spotlights on the boat.  
**EDIT 319: 7:40PM** There is quite a bit of movement in the boat.  He is sitting up and moving.  
**EDIT 318: 7:39PM** SORRY!  It wouldn't let me make a new post in /r/news so I had to make one here.  I don't know why.  
**EDIT 317: 7:32PM** They are working to meet up around the back of the house.  They almost have the top of the boat ripped off.

---
The suspect is in custody and is confirmed as the 19 year old brother in the Boston Marathon Bombing.  He **IS ALIVE** but is severely wounded.  He is being treated for wounds as I write this.  I want to thank everyone for the kind words, the support of the Reddit community for all of those in Boston currently, and for all of the hopes and prayers you sent out.  I apologize for any mistakes I made during this reporting and typing but hopefully I was able to share the information in a fair and rapid way.  Thank you to everyone that posted before me and those that have followed this for all these hours.  I'm off to find me some pizza.  Good night Reddit, and be proud tonight for the swift end to this ordeal.

---

**9:01PM**

The commissioner just spoke saying thank you to all of the PD of Boston, thanking them for their efforts and bravery in the face of danger.

""It is a proud day to be from Boston""


---

I tried to respond to every one that messaged me saying thank you but in case I missed you, thank you for your kind words as well.  I'm finally through clicking all of the comments so I don't have 32497 unread messages anymore.  Thank you to everyone that has stayed up and commented and helped out, and I'm glad that we were all here as a community.  Hopefully this will show the news outlets that we can be a positive community that isn't all about ""witch hunts"" and false accusations.  We are a community about helping each other get raw information and working out the details.  To everyone in Boston - hopefully you guys can sleep a little but calmer tonight and I hope this ordeal doesn't happen anytime soon to you, or to anyone else in America, or the world for that matter.  I am touched by all of your kind words, offers of pizza, and gold, and thank you again for keeping me company while writing these final updates.

We owe a great thanks to /u/cedargrove and /u/JPDeathBlade as well.  I merely latched on for the final three threads, and I'm happy I did.  Now I'm off to go read the other 25 messages in my inbox and to actually grab a beer.  Good night Reddit, and sleep well.

**EDIT 384: 8:56PM** Everyone is clearing out and finalizing movement out.  I am going to believe that the suspect is alive at the moment as they continue to refer to him ""in custody"" rather than ""deceased"".  Just my personal opinion and that means nothing.  They are currently organizing the return of all weapons to the appropriate jurisdictions.  I think we're all done here.  ""Good job boys.""  
**EDIT 383: 8:55PM** ""APP TO ALL BOSTON POLICE - WE HAVE OUR SECOND SUSPECT OF THE BOSTON MARATHON BOMBING IN CUSTODY  -  REPEAT  -  THE SECOND SUSPECT IS IN CUSTODY.""  
**EDIT 382: 8:53PM** Thanks is going around to the TAC squads, the FBI, the dispatch, everyone seems to feel this part of the ordeal is over.  
**EDIT 381: 8:52PM** ""Great job""  
**EDIT 380: 8:51PM** Every suspect is being questioned, not sure who else they have to question but possibly witnesses or others detained during the investigation.  The FBI and the police are meeting to discuss transport I believe.  
**EDIT 379: 8:50PM** Officers are continuing to the sweep the area.  
**EDIT 378: 8:49PM** All residents being asked to return back to their houses to clear the street.  Potential helicopter lift for the suspect.  Unsure once again.  Apologies for waffling.  Asking to clear the street for the ""victim"".  Don't know what to make out of that.   
**EDIT 377: 8:48PM** Suspect is once again confirmed in custody.  That makes me feel he is still alive, if only barely.  
**EDIT 376: 8:47PM** Confirmed once more - suspect is in custody.  Conflicting reports about suspect being dead and suspect being treated by an EMS.  I will not make any claims to either point.  They are still calling an ambulance.  
**EDIT 375: 8:46PM** Cheers from the crowd heard as scanners reported they have the man in custody.  WE HAVE NO IDEA IF THIS IS THE 19 YEAR OLD WHITE HAT.  
**EDIT 374: 8:45PM** I am still on local Boston scanner and can't get the Eastern Mass one to work but it appears they have him in custody.  
**EDIT 373: 8:44PM** Local Boston media reporting suspect is captured and alive, medic on route.  
**EDIT 372: 8:43PM** Probably not about the suspect in the boat - talking about the EOD unit in Watertown.  
**EDIT 371: 8:43PM** Suspect might be about the black bag.  No clues.  
**EDIT 370: 8:42PM** ""MEDIC! MEDIC!""  Chilling cry.  
**EDIT 369: 8:42PM** Suspect in custody but NO ONE INSIDE OF PERIMETER  
**EDIT 368: 8:40PM** Media was ordered off the roof, not Police.  My apologies.  I also forgot to turn off post replies going to my inbox...fail...  
**EDIT 367: 8:39PM** Abandoned black bag outside in the city of Boston.  Not located near the episode going on.  It is actually in Watertown not Boston.  Proceeding EOD.  
**EDIT 366: 8:39PM** Asking all police in the outer perimeter to hold fast and be prepared.  
**EDIT 365: 8:38PM** 110 comments in 2 minutes... /facepalm  
**EDIT 364: 8:36PM** Talking about grabbing rifle shields and meeting up with FBI TAC.  Police have been ordered off the roof, not sure why.

Thank you, Reddit, for helping make this little girl part of my life. Her family sends their thanks and gratitude for your support.

##IMPORTANT EDIT:##

I went to Kathleen visitation today (1/13/12) and expressed the condolences of the Reddit community and the world to the dad and family.  They won't admit it, but the cost of the funeral seems to be set to crush the family financially.  If anyone cares to donate to help with the funeral expenses, please do so.  I have a paypal link set up [on this page](https://treetowntoys.com/kathleens-big-day), and will ensure that all funds donated there make it to the family for the funeral costs.  I hate to ask for more help for these guys, but with the national media chasing this story and the number of people from the area coming to the viewing and funeral tomorrow this is not a cheap affair.  Thank you one and all for anything you can spare! And thank you all who have already donated.

EDIT: 

Since this has now hit the press, I suppose it's OK to share some of the background.

Kathleen fell a few days ago, and split her scalp on a door frame. She could barely walk or talk due to the HD, but she always had smiles for everyone. She needed a few staples apparently to hold the skin together. She got an infection, and that was the last straw. She went pretty quickly after that. She was so tiny due to the HD, and was already pretty weak.  Her dad called me last night about 10:20pm to tell me, and I knew immediately when I saw the caller ID what the call was before I answered.  He was, of course, completely and totally a wreck.  He thanked me for everything I'd done for the family - and I want to pass on to reddit that I didn't really do anything - you guys did.  So, the thanks goes to so many of you.

This afternoon, the Boston Marathon was suspended due to an attack. This event is a tragedy in the making, covered internationally by media, government, and citizen alike; I can't say what the highest number was but I personally witnessed sixty thousand people listen in on scanners over the internet. With contradicting information coming from all over, places like reddit have done a superb job of disseminating and organizing information, helping establish aid for those who need it, and otherwise being a calm voice in an otherwise hectic disaster. In this thread I will begin by laying out fact versus speculation, and then provide the resources available at this time.
  
As it is a constantly developing story, this post is obviously subject to change. Please be patient with me as I try to keep on top of an ever-growing pile of dubious information. Sourcing will be done in the comments, due to text constraints of self posts.
  
----
  
###The story as it stands
    
**Casualties**
  
As of the hospital press briefing, the final number is 183 injured. 100 so far have been released from medical care. 17 people were in critical condition after the blast, and I don't have any updates on how many remain so. Of the fatalities, one child of eight, Martin Richard. The second victim is Krystle Campbell, age 29. The third, a woman aged 23 is a student at Boston University. Family has now okay'ed her identification so I will say that her name is Lingzi Lu.
  
There is a photograph of two women lying on the ground having their pulse checked, one of which has been severely wounded. It is believed that she is one of the fatalities; however, the other woman appears to have died from the other explosion. (it is accepted but unconfirmed that the woman departed in this image is Krystle)
  
Jeff, the subject of the famous image of the man in the wheelchair who's legs were shredded by the explosion is supposedly in stable condition.
  
**The bombs**
  
There have been two bombs, and only two. The incident at JFK library was due to a machine room fire, and all of the suspicious items (up to 5 other suspected) disposed of by authorities have been shown to not contain explosives.
  
Official reports state that the bombs were ""probably"" pressure cookers, black nylon bag residue found in both blast scenes. As of today, with the leaked images of the bomb residue, it is accepted that the bombs were 6L pressure cookers stuffed with ball bearing and nail shrapnel. A circuit board has been recovered that may expose how the bombs were set off; the FBI has not come to any conclusions on the matter and have not commented further. Note that the only ""official"" information we have is that these bombs were ""probably"" pressure cookers, so under no circumstance is this summary set in stone.
  
Images of evidence from the blast: http://www.reuters.com/article/slideshow/idUSBRE93G04T20130417
  
During the event there was worry about cell service shutting down; this could be due to a fear of the bombs set off by phone, or simply the flood of calls overloaded the area, causing people to lose service. However, police are still recommending that you text rather than call, just in case.
  
Also during the event, there was fear of a failed third device (not the JFK scare) in a trash can at the finish line. This resulted in a controlled detonation by authorities. However, to my knowledge it was not an explosive.
  
On the afternoon of the 17th, there was a hype buildup concerning a possible arrest, which later proved to be false. During this time, however, the federal courthouse building was given it's first ever Code Red. Bomb squads rushed to the scene and the harbor was locked down by authorities in boats. The bomb scare proved to be a false alarm.
  
The risin events from the morning of the 17th were unrelated to the bombings.
  
**Suspects**
  
**Photos of Persons of Interests are now up on http://fbi.gov. Send tips to http://bostonmarathontips.fbi.gov or call 1800-CALL-FBI if you know anything. Do NOT try to aprehend or contact these individuals yourself.**
  
The investigation has now become one of national focus. The FBI is now responsible for the investigation, and ATF is confirmed to be in the area, as well as Navy and National Guard. For a while it surfaced that CIA and antiterrorism task forces are working in the are as well; however, there is only one source for this so I would hesitate to confirm it.
  
Specialists are coming in to investigate the video evidence.
  
The crime zone in Copley Square was initially 15 blocks, and has now been [reduced to 12 blocks](https://twitter.com/Boston_Police/status/324604822911348737/photo/1). Copley Square will likely be a crime zone for the next few days as they reduce the area. A warranted search of a Revere apartment building was conducted late last night, and later confirmed. However, the apartment was a dead end for investigation; the resident was a victim of the blast, not a suspect. The city will be covered by more security, with more wary authorities as well as presence from national and federal investigators. The MBTA will conduct random bag searches.
  
The story of the Saudi national has been a hive of misinformation so I'll try to clear that up as best as I can: a Saudi national may or may not have been detained, either he was hospitalized from the attack and put under guard, or seen running from the scene and arrested. Shortly after initially breaking, official reports denied any arrests; however, rumors of guarded patients continued into the night. Some time the 16th there were claims that if this Saudi national was detained to begin with he was found innocent and released. Official reports have denied holding him, and have made mention that police presence in hospitals is specifically for asking eyewitness reports.
  
On an individual level, this was definitely a predetermined attack; the possibility of a 'gas leak' was shot down minutes after the explosions occurred. No groups or organizations have taken credit for the attack, and the Pakistani Taliban has outright denied responsibility. However, this may still very well be an attack conducted by an organization rather than an individual. Furthermore, we do not know whether or not this is a domestic or international issue. This is likely, though unconfirmed, to be a terrorist attack, and at this point I would like to make a statement of clarification due to some comments: terrorism by definition has no need to be based in agendas or political ideology.
  
On the 17th, AP reported that an arrest is imminent; however, there is no indication that there are ID'd suspects, let alone any information on their locations. Later that day, CNN jumped the gun on a possible arrest. Other news broadcasts used CNN as a source and the rumor spread across news media. Skeptics called to question the legitimacy of the source, and with no response it became clear that this assumption was on shaky ground. Boston police [later denied](https://twitter.com/Boston_Police/status/324591574807891968) that any arrests have been made.

###For those displaced by the attacks
  
**Retrieving your belongings**
  
[The Boston Marathon Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/TheBostonMarathon) has recently said:
&gt; As such, the runners' bags that were being picked up on Berkeley Street are now being moved to ""The Castle"" at 101 Arlington Street (at Stuart St.) and will be available until 7:00 p.m. tonight.
  
**Leaving the city**
  
Tomorrow the MBTA will run as normal; as should all flights and trains. If you need help getting a flight or a train or a ride, consult the reddit resources below.
  
Roads closed:  

 * Clarendon from Huntington to Newbury
 * Huntington from Belvedere to Clarendon
 * Boylston from Berkely to Mass Ave

If situations are dire, you can consult [this resource for local shelters](http://www.homelessshelterdirectory.org/cgi-bin/id/city.cgi?city=Boston&amp;state=MA).
  
Again, many redditors are offering their assistance. The redditor resource can be especially useful.

&gt;I don't want to promote a sudden flood of new accounts to the site (because it is partly based on having built a reputation), but please add [Couch Surfing](//couchsurfing.org) to the available accommodations list. People that are members of the site should remember to [find hosts](https://www.couchsurfing.org/search/in/city/3626979/mode/L) and those that are available to host should confirm their couch status is open.  
&gt;Here is the [Boston forum](https://www.couchsurfing.org/n/places/boston-massachusetts-united-states) on Couch Surfing.

**As of now, the authorities are asking for any and all media recording of the event, namely video and photo, for their investigation. If you were there, or in the area, please don't hesitate!**
  
**Blood**
  
There was frantic discussion about blood donations in the first hour of the event. However, the Red Cross has said that it has sufficient blood for the situation. Still, donating blood will assist the injured.
  
[The Red Cross's website for Boston blood donations](http://www.redcrossblood.org/locations/boston-donation-center)  
[Children's Hospital blood donation site](http://childrenshospital.org/about/Site1394/mainpageS1394P6.html)  
[Mass General's blood donation site](http://www.massgeneral.org/blooddonor/donatingblood/)  
[Carter BloodCare](http://www.carterbloodcare.org/)
  
Right now blood is in no short supply, and blood is perishable quickly. It would be more useful to make an appointment for the next few days or weeks rather than rush in now!
  
**Offer shelter**
  
[Boston.com's list of offers](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1r2dbf7q2sIiiQWynPNgH74qNeheNycTyk7hXue9AJhs/viewform?pli=1), as mentioned above.
  
**Donations**
  
Please do not donate to uncredited charities on Facebook and other such sites! The Red Cross and Salvation Army are two primary organizations involved in assistance and will gladly accept your charity. I was recently linked [the Children's Hospital Amazon Wishlist](http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/3BI2LVVRH4KZG/) as well. **Edit**: Because of bomb scares in the area, packages are being delayed or suspended. Feel free to keep donating but avoid anything perishable and don't spend for rush shipping!

1349445438.0,1594,self.news,10zqa3,Boy Scout denied Eagle award after coming out,RickShaw530,2629,1035,432,http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/10zqa3/boy_scout_denied_eagle_award_after_coming_out/,"A longtime Boy Scout claims he's being denied the organization's highest honor because he's gay.
Ryan Andresen, who lives near San Francisco, recently finished an extensive service project needed to earn his Eagle Scout award, but his troop leader refuses to give him the rank.
""He said he can't because Ryan said he is gay,"" said Karen Andresen, the scout's mother.
Ryan claims the scoutmaster knew about his sexual orientation well before he started the project and paperwork for the honor.
""He had been telling me all along that we'd get by the gay thing,"" Ryan told Yahoo News. ""It was by far the biggest goal of my life. It's totally devastating.""
The scoutmaster of Troop 212 in Moraga, Calif., did not immediately return phone and email messages seeking comment.
--&gt;
The Scouts' national spokesman, Deron Smith, said late Thursday that Ryan contributed to his situation by disagreeing with the BSA's religious principles.
""Recently, a Scout proactively notified his unit leadership and Eagle Scout Counselor that he does not agree to Scouting's principle of ""Duty to God"" and does not meet Scouting's membership standard on sexual orientation,"" Smith wrote in a statement to Yahoo News. ""While the BSA did not proactively ask for this information, based on his statements and after discussion with his family he is being informed that he is no longer eligible for membership in Scouting.""
Smith said belief in God is the foundation of scouting's strong, continuing commitment to encouraging moral, ethical and spiritual growth. It is the position of the Boy Scouts of America that no one can reach their full potential without belief in a higher power.
In July, Boy Scouts of America national leaders emphatically reaffirmed its policy of excluding gays— preserving a controversial policy that was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2000.
The decision has sparked an intense public debate. Companies and organizations have canceled annual donations, and nearly 300 Eagles have reportedly returned their medals in protest. (More than two million Eagle Scout medals have been earned since 1911.)
Eagle Scout Zach Wahls launched the website Scouts for Equality this summer. He said Ryan's case is unique, because many gay scouts are forced out before they get a chance to earn an Eagle badge.
""He is a case study of the detrimental effects this policy has on young men,"" Wahls said.
While the national organization's exclusion applies to adult leaders and scouts, some local chapters have rejected the policy.
Ryan's mother started a petition on Change.org two days ago to try to convince her son's scoutmaster to hurry and reverse his decision. Under Scout rules, Ryan must earn his Eagle badge by his 18th birthday, which is Monday.
""It hurts me so much to watch Ryan suffer for being who he is, because to me, he's perfect,"" she wrote on the website. ""Ryan has worked for nearly 12 years to become an Eagle Scout, and nothing would make him more proud than earning that well-deserved distinction.""

Ryan Andresen stands in front of his service project to promote anti-bullying awareness. (Andresen family)
More than 50,000 people had signed the petition as of Thursday afternoon.
Karen Andresen said her son, who joined when he was 6, put in extra hours to finish the Eagle requirements.
""He scrambled to get that service project done,"" she said. ""He was so close and he had worked so hard.""
For his project, Ryan built an anti-bullying Tolerance Wall at his local middle school. With the help of students, he amassed a mosaic from 288 ceramic tiles illustrating acts of kindness.
Ryan said he believes the scoutmaster was influenced by veteran leaders above him.
""I'm so disappointed and confused,"" he said. ""I know he isn't a person who hates gay people, but I never thought he would do something like this.""

Think of the excellent science, history, and arts content PBS and NPR produce. On the whole, it is just *so* much better than its more commercialized counterparts. And, good god, just look at what chasing after advertising dollars has done the quality of cable channels like the History Channel:

* [*Ancient Aliens*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Aliens)?
* [*Only in America with Larry the Cable Guy*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_the_Cable_Guy)?
* [*Top Shot*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Shot)?
* [*Pawn Stars*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pawn_Stars)? *(edit: apparently, this one has some fans who think this doesn't belong with the others)

I don't know about you, but I would die a little inside if PBS had to start moving in that direction.

I know times are tight, but *please* donate what you feel you can to PBS and NPR to help them weather the storm. Donate whatever they're worth to you.

*edit:  In retrospect, it may have been better if I'd worded the headline as* ***""Congressional*** *Republicans"" and ""all* ***federal*** *funding,"" but it's too late now.*

*In all likelihood, House Republicans will likely not succeed in eliminating Federal CPB funding, but they *will* probably manage to force CPB to take a pretty big hit.*

http://www.facebook.com/CarolCNN

That was her facebook. If you go to it now nothing comes up.

https://twitter.com/carolcnn

Her twitter is still up and on her twitter page is a link to her (now non existent) facebook page.

Edit: original video that started it all http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfsQhtEvH7g

Before Bill Nye gets a chance to speak she discredits him, and labels him ""kooky"". Also what she says is entirely false, if you google Bill Nye ""kooky guy who doesn't know what he's talking about"" doesn't come up unless it's referencing this very video. 

Some people are saying it could have been her producer feeding her lines. I still hold her responsible. As a journalist she could have stood her ground and said she wasn't going to make false statements. She is a TV personality, she knows she has to be accountable for what she says. Also as others have pointed out its not the first time she has done so. Her past reporting shows a questionable bais towards right wing talking points.

Also shit rolls down hill and [""gripes go up""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IGEs_j590g&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=94s). We bitch to her, she bitches to her producer, producer bitches to some CNN executive, etc.  I see no problem in calling her out on HER actions. If she was really a pupet she has the choice to come out and say so. 

Edit 2: Im getting a few PM's calling me a scum bag for posting personal information.  

Here is my reply:

*That wasn't personal info, that was her public facebook and twitter account.
She is a TV personality and on her own segment she says: ""tell me what you think on my twitter and on my facebook"" She has links to her twitter and facebook on screen all the time.
I did not post her personal Facebook, I did not post her adress or phone number.
If media personalities want to use the internet to push their agendas then they have to deal with the consequences, when they get called out on their bullshit.*

*Also on a personal level I minored in journalism and frankly am quite sick of what's become of modern day journalism. No one does research any more they just discuss talking points and buzz words, quote twitter and blogs while some new pop song plays in between segments.
If the internet has done anything worth while for society, it's the fact that it's given the average Joe a platform to call out bullshit when they see it.*

Newtown CT is asking for our help.
We are trying to assemble teams of 15 to stand in a wall blocking the 
Westboro Baptist Church protesters
from the families 
during the funerals of the victims of the shootings.

If you are able to put together teams of 15 and can get to Newtown CT
please let us know.
If you would like to go single, or with a few,
also let us know, and we will try to put teams together.

Once teams are submitted, 
they will create a schedule.

We truly appreciate your help and support.

    IMMEDIATE RELEASE No. 602-12 July 20, 2012
    Statement on Colorado Shooting Incident
    The Department of Defense is deeply saddened by the news of
    the tragic incident at the Aurora Mall Movie Theater in Aurora, Colo.
    Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and the families of those
    impacted by this event. One sailor was injured and one, known to have
    been at the theatre that evening, is currently unaccounted for.
    Two airmen were injured in the incident. The Navy and the Air Force are
    working with the families of these service members to ensure they have
    the care and attention they need. We can also confirm that the alleged
    gunman in this incident, James Holmes, is not a past or current member of
    any branch or component of the U.S. Armed Forces.

My family owned business has been in the same location for over 35 years. More than likely if you open your big yellow phonebook (if you have one) you'll see there are quite a few locksmiths in your area! They will list local phone numbers that are re-directed to a phone bank, and the addresses will be houses or food markets, etc. About 120 in mine, in a 5 town perimeter. 
I can assure you there are only 4-5 legitimate licensed locksmiths in my area. These scammers will quote you a very low price over the phone, and show up in an unmarked vehicle (even taxis) and perform sloppy and destructive work methods to complete the job. Then charging 3-5x more then any legitimate locksmith. These scammers are feeding on the un-informed and hurting my small family owned business and along with MANY others. Do some research and find a good local locksmith in your area prior to needing them. The following states require licenses. Be sure to check they're licensed. 
Alabama
California
Connecticut
Illinois
Louisiana
Maryland
Nebraska
Nevada
New Jersey
North Carolina
