Something even better happened yesterday:  we went to Nordstrom Rack, and she found four bras in the clearance bin.  

The total was $65ish for four bras!  Regularly those bras would've cost her $270 total!  She came out of the dressing room almost in tears.  She told me she had never had such a positive bra shopping experience.  She was absolutely beaming last night.

This CH Biszkopty arrived yesterday, and I feel like I have found my perfect bra. I've been on the hunt for a great fitting bra for a couple of months now, gradually getting closer. Every little fit issue has been solved with this bra, and now I just want to show it off. I've compared it to the last bra I bought before I started figuring this all out. It's a 34A, which believe it or not, I thought looked really good.

I've been wearing a 34A bra since I started buying bras, because, well it fit better than a 32A. I knew they didn't fit, of course, but it never occurred to me that they could. My boobs were just too tiny. My breasts would fully come out the bottom of my bra as soon as I so much as stood up straight. I just slouched and constantly pulled it down. My straps were constantly falling off my shoulders, and even unhooking themselves and falling down my sleeves. To avoid the embarrassment of bra straps, I would wear strapless bras and hike them up super high, constantly adjusting and slouching so they wouldn't fall down. I cannot believe I accepted this, but I did. For over 10 years. I'm 24. Because without a bra, I was 100% flat, and that felt even worse. 

A bra that fits has made me love my boobs. Sure they're small, but they look great, and even suit my body. I feel like a woman. A sexy woman. Not just an awkward weirdo trying to pretend.

I haven't actually bought any bra's while subscribed here (and so I haven't gotten my new measurements that i'm sure will drastically improve my bra experience) because i've been poor as shit.  Regardless, like MUA I stay here because I might learn by exposure.

The trend i've noticed lately has been a little disturbing however.  There have been a few posts now that basically ""shame"" public figures in their bras.  I understand the necessity of pointing out how a bra should fit and what is not fitting, but the way these posts are presented they are less critiques and more judgmental call-outs.  

The one that comes to mind is the recent kate upton one.  Granted, she is wearing ill fitting bras, but it felt like the OP was being a little nasty about it. The first picture was obviously for a runway, where models don't have any say in what they wear. The others were for movie sets or photo shoots, where there is still no choice in what is worn.  

There have been other posts that are along the lines of ""Oh dear god, look at what she's wearing!""  which I don't think is very helpful.  

Do you guys really enjoy posts like this?  Can't we approach it in a less judgmental way and still get the point across?

I followed the links on the side bars and I measured myself.  I didn't exactly believe the results.  And I let it go.

And some time later...  maybe a few weeks, or maybe a couple months... I read more testimonials, and perused more measuring sites, and I measured myself again. Ok, I thought my 44F Caciques were pretty ginormous.  But 44L?  Ok, though, this time I added the size to my flair.  In a way, I guess this was the first time I ""tried"" the size on... 

Another month goes by, maybe two.  More testimonials.  What the heck, I think.  Go find a 44L and just see... So I do.  I score a $20 red number on a clearance sale at Just My Size.  And I order it.

While I am waiting for the package to arrive, that little voice in my head tells me, NAHHHHH... when that thing gets here it's going to be so big and awkward.  I mean, 44L?  Really?  Come on...  I am prepared to admit to myself that I wasted 20 bucks that I really can't afford to waste just for this little experiment.

10 days later (today), the package arrives.  I look at this bra.  No way, I think.  I try it on.

Damn if it doesn't fit like a dream, and is easily the most comfortable bra I own.  So the title of this is my first reaction to admitting my true size to myself.  I am a 44L.  That did not make me happy at first.

I tried on a shirt or two, and... just WOW.  The difference is spectacular!  This looks great too!

I've been wearing this AWESOME bra for nearly an hour now, and I want to run screaming through the streets proclaiming proudly ""I am a 44L!""  Yeah, that's probably not a good idea either.

I posted here a little while ago for advice and finally got out to try some new bras! I was looking for 30C or D and my mother kept telling me that I couldn't fit into the cup. I tried to explain to her how cup sizes aren't constant by showing her the 30D beside a 36D. She saw what I was saying, but still said that since I'm normally a 32B and I ""fit"" in her 34A (barely, the band is definitely too big) a D could never fit. The saleswoman said that since she herself wasn't a D cup, I couldn't be one. I suspect she is wearing an ill-fitting bra as well, unfortunately, because her breasts were much larger than mine. 

So, armed with the only 30D in the store and a 32B for comparison, I made my way to the fitting room. The 32B was too large in the band, though the cups are alright. The 30D had almost the exact same cups, but the band was perfect! Finally!! I called my mother in. She looked at the size. Called the saleswoman in. She looked at the size. They both said, ""well, you've taught me something about bras today.""

I'm very happy with my new bra and so glad I could spread awareness. Especially hearing an upscale-store's saleswoman admitting that she could learn something new about lingerie. Hopefully she will pass it on. I need to work on my mother now, maybe she'll be refitting herself soon!

*****

I had read and read every resource from this subreddit and taken all the advice that everyone had given in that previous thread, and so I decided to take the plunge yesterday.  I just straight up told her I wanted to have a serious discussion...   ...about her breasts.  She immediately started laughing about the absurdity of it all and why on earth have I been researching bras and all that, but that was all to be expected.  She knows who I am so she shouldn't really be THAT surprised. =p   I also remind her that if she hears me out and then it's all nonsense and nothing changes, she'll forever more have this story to tell about how her batshit insane husband tried to tell her about bras.  That pushed it over the edge as she would love to have something like that over me. =p

So I break it all down. I explain the basics as seen on this subreddit.  I explain again how ""an A cup is an A cup"" is not true at all.  I show her [the links](http://blog.butterflycollection.ca/2012/05/bra-school-not-all-d-cups-are-same-size.html) to back it up.  She's starts to get shocked.  She's starts to make comments about how that's now how she always believed it to be!  I go on and on covering everything about [sister sizes](http://blog.butterflycollection.ca/2013/04/what-sister-size-bras-look-like.html) and I also she her the [great diagram](http://c.thumbs.redditmedia.com/i39z-7cv35uEv6Ph.png) about the ratios that really changed everything.  She's starting to get intrigued, but what does it all mean and what can she do about it.

Finally, I bring up the scoop and swoop again.  She immediately gives this bit of an eye roll and thinks I'm crazy, but fortunately I've already disproved enough of what she believed to hear me out.  I explain what's going on with the migrated tissue and how it needs to be in the cup and on and on.  I can tell that she thinks that make sense if you have big boobs, but she doesn't think she does.  But I'm ready for that, so I explicitly show her [this blog post](http://brasandbodyimage.wordpress.com/2012/09/05/putting-your-bra-on-properly/) pointing out the ABTF additions at the bottom of girls with ""small boobs"".  She's still not convinced, but intrigued.

She says, ""So what do you want me to do?""  I just say that I'd like her to try some of her existing bras and really try to do it right and scoop and swoop and see what happens.  She does!   The results are less than spectacular.  It doesn't seem to have a great effect.  I would have liked to see her put more effort in her scooping, but I'm afraid to push too hard.  There is a slightly noticeable impact though.   The real problem is that the bras she has are way too small.  Most are 36 band and too tight on her...and worse they're A or maybe B cups which are too small for her.   I tell her you can't scoop into a container that is way too small to counter her argument that she has nothing to scoop.  I'm starting to worry that I'm losing her interest.

Fortunately, a wild 38B appears from her drawer!  The 38 band is MUCH better.   She actually says she likes this bra but the 38 is kind of tight too (as I mentioned she almost always uses the extenders for all of these).   I point out that part of the problem with the band being too tight is tissue in the band that should be scooped...so properly scooping and swooping should make the band feel less tight.  She tries it, but still there's not a huge impact visually.  It does however make it more comfortable.   Then we both come to this amazing conclusion almost simultaneously...her chest looks AMAZING in this bra.  She readjusts and rescoops a few times and we start to see that there is a difference both visually and for her comfort.  It's working!  I still think a 38C would be better since there's still some on the side that won't get into the B.  She kind of agrees!  I start to boost her confidence and remind her about the sizings...that really a 38C is like a 36D.  She gives me that look like wow she hadn't realized.   She has always tried to find 38 and 40 bands but still looking for A cups because she was convinced she was an A no matter what.

By this point, she's really starting to believe and we talk about some places she can try stuff (Nordstrom Rack) and I also mention that there's a ton of places online we can get them in any size she needs.  Even if she needs or prefers 40 bands, we can still find them.   Always looking for A cups had been what always made it so difficult.  So the night ends with her somewhat convinced and plans that we'll investigate more and try to figure it out...




*****




Cut to this morning.  She's got an early hair appointment so she's already up and dressed when I wake up.  Turns out she's done some experimenting of her own!  She has on the aforementioned 38B and she said she was really aggressively scooping and swooping (later last night I finally showed her [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=it29EzYo24w) so she'd know how aggressive to be).  She said she did it only on one side and looked down and was blown away.  It was a huge difference!   She had done it really aggressively scooping and said she could really feel tissue being pulled up and into the cup.   To be honest her chest looked magnificent...even moreso than usual. =)  She's a total believer now.  She even said that I've totally blown her mind and she couldn't believe how she had it all wrong and she's going to send messages to all the women she knows about this stuff.  LOL...SUCCESS!    So after her hair appointment, she's off to Nordstrom to try on some other 38B and also to try the 38C.  I wish I was with her to help evaluate fit and give confidence, but alas I have to care for the baby. =p   She also may try some 36C and 36D...again I reminded that if she scoops properly the smaller band won't necessarily be too tight.   I also pointed out that if 38C is right, that's equivalent of like a 34DD, and I bet she never thought she'd be like a double D. =p  She smiled and agreed...and just kinda looked happy and excited about it all.  She said again how this may change her life.  I'm so happy because I'll think she'll be so much more confident about her appearance this way.

Many thanks to everyone here in ABTF for all the help you gave me [first post](http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/1jgixc/trying_to_convince_my_wifeneed_help/).  This is a truly great and helpful community and I really appreciate everyone's help especially considering I'm just a guy. =)  I'll post more updates if there's more interesting news and maybe even convince her to post some before and after photos so you all can see the difference and help evaluate the final fit!   Thanks again everyone!

EDIT: Update!  So she did try on a variety of them at Target and Nordstrom today.   It seems like 38C is where it's at.   Even 36D wasn't working for her as the band was too tight.   The 38C are maybe just SLIGHTLY too small in the cups, but the 38D she didn't even come close to filling out.   With proper scooping, she said the 38 bands were filling fine, so it seems like that is right.    

So then we went online and ordered her a variety...we got some of the recommended ones from the shallow breast guide and some that she liked the look.  Trying to recall, I think it was 3 Triumph, 1 Freya, 1 Wacoal, 2 b.tempt'd, and 1 Pour Moi?...so that seems like a nice sampling of the brands.  We got all 38C except for one 40B to try.   Hopefully as they come in, we can get some pics of the ones she likes and ABTF can help us assess the fit and give suggestions.

Second off, this is a call out to the Victoriaâs Secret haters. I love ABTF and am thankful every day when I wear my bras, but this hate towards VS has got to go. 

It seems as if every time VS is mentioned, it is downvoted, mocked, and bashed. Yes, they falsely advertise as if they fit all bodies, when in reality their size range is limited. Yes, many of their fitters are inept (Iâd also argue that most fitters any place are as well). And I do understand that they have been a horrible experience for many. However, some women do actually fall within that size range and seeing poisonous view towards their go-to bra store cannot feel good to them. This subreddit should be a safe place for everyone.

Furthermore, we cannot keep this attitude without harming ourselves and other women. Every time a VS employee does an AMA that gets rude and spiteful comments coming from this community, we drive them away and doom hundreds of women to ill-fitting bras. These VS employees are potential recruits to the cause! We should be welcoming them and educating them, involving them in the community. What we should not do is continue to drive them off.

Frankly, VS employees could be a powerful catalyst in this bra-fitting revolution, more so than you or me. They are the ones fitting hundreds of women for better or worse. Iâd like to make it for the better. I propose we set aside our negative emotions and replace them with something more positive. Letâs see the potential in the VS employees and welcome them and educate them. Weâre here to help others, aren't we?

**EDIT**

ABTF, thanks for the knowledge and fitting bras, but I will no longer be visiting here. This topic has put me through the wringer. I will definitely continue to gladly direct people here.

Since creating this topic, I have received **five** private messages from posters who felt unable to share on this subreddit because they would be revealing fit checks for VS bras, positive fitting experiences at VS, or their like of the product.

*I write to apply for a position in Retail Sales in the Lingerie Department at Nordstrom. Though it may seem strange that someone would choose to work with women's underwear instead of women's clothing, shoes, or even in men's fashion, I am truly passionate about helping women find their proper bra size. It's said that nearly 90% of women are wearing the wrong bra size, and I know this to be true because for years, I was one of them. It was only after doing intense research online, fitting myself using several different methods, and trying on dozens of bras that I learned what a difference a properly fitting bra can make! Now that I understand how the fit of the bra is impacted by the size and shape of the breast and the brand and type of bra, I am committed to helping other women find comfortable, well-fitting and attractive bras that make them look and feel better. I can't think of a better place to do that than at Nordstrom, a store that is often praised for its excellent bra selection and professionalism in fitting.

My self-esteem was dry,

I wore a crop-top every day,

And never questioned why. 



Though I longed for frills and lace,

I knew they weren't for me,

My little breasts would be out of place,

In such bras of luxury. 



But peer pressure finally got to me,

My embarassment, even worse,

Passing the A's, I bought a B,

Lack of knowledge was my curse. 



Many years of shame soon passed,

And I was introduced to Reddit,

ABraThatFits, I saw at last,

But alas, I still did not get it. 



'80 percent don't wear their best,'

But that did not apply to me!

A B barely fit my tiny chest!

Wasn't that plain to see? 



One day MyWifesBusty's measuring guide,

I decided to try for a giggle,

My boyfriend measured around my side,

While I tried not to wiggle. 



As so many of us have, I laughed;

'That simply cannot be!

No, really now, don't be daft!

I can't be a 30E!'. 



Only pornstars have that size,

Mine were a handful at best,

I dismissed my results as complete lies,

And ashamedly covered my breast. 



But curiosity niggled at me,

'til I gave in and trudged into town,

The assistant said '32C',

Then left me alone with a frown. 



Disheartened yet not defeated,

Your testimonials gave me heart,

I refused to be easily cheated,

Giving up would not be smart. 



Ignoring the sizing suggestion,

I took a 30E into the stall,

Suddenly, I knew without question,

Reeling, I fell 'gainst the wall. 



Comparable only to orgasm,

With nirvana, I felt a connection,

I had my first real bra-gasm,

As I stared at my gorgeous reflection. 



Now it's because of your teaching,

That wearing clothes seems a shame,

That my friends are sick of my preaching,

And my love for bras, I proclaim. 



So non-believers, listen up,

Popular opinions are very wrong,

Don't put so much faith in the cup,

It's been about the band:cup ratio all along. 



Finally, my gratitude is beyond words,

Now I am so proud of my tits,

Thanks to all you boys and birds,

You angels of ABraThatFits.

Miraculously, she found two in her size (32DD) that were on sale. Score!

They offered to measure me, too. Sure, I said politely, I've never been measured here. The associate first measured around my armpits, across the top of my chest. (This is an incredibly dumb measurement. You'll notice that most women do not, in fact, wear their bras across the top of the chest.) Then she measured my full bust. I could see her counting under her breath, and she looked alarmed when she clearly went past VS's available sizes. Still, she proclaimed me ""a 36DDD"" and handed me one to try on.

HAHAHAHAHAHAHA no. My actual size is 32HH. That's two band sizes too big and four cup volumes too small. (The volume of 36DDD = 34FF = 32G.) I tried the bra for the sake of the experiment, and it fit exactly like you'd expect. The band rode up badly in the back, I was quadboobing out of it, and the center front stood out a good three inches.

To her credit, she didn't try to convince me that it fit, although when she checked on me, I already looked pretty skeptical and the fit was REALLY bad, so I think she knew it was a lost cause. I said gently, ""Usually when I measure, I measure at the underbust. I normally wear 32HH."" ""I bet that fits a lot better."" ""Yeah, it does."" She then asked if I worked in the industry, and I said no, I'm a corsetmaker. ""Oh, that makes sense!"" she replied.

Afterwards, we went to a specialty bra boutique (Ma Cherie et Moi in Santa Rosa, CA) that sold Belgian and German bras. I tried on one that was labeled 32I, the largest cup size they had. European sizing is different from the UK system, and the saleslady, even after five years at this store, could not explain to me how the sizing worked, so I'm not sure what the UK equivalent to an I cup is. Of course it was much too small, and she suggested I go up a band size. I pointed out that the reason the band looked too small was because the cup was far too small, and going up a band size would just make the band ride up. She brushed that aside, clearly not believing me that a too-small cup can make a correctly sized band appear too small.

I hope they respond, I really want to hear what they have to say about their fitting techniques and poor selection of sizes.

&gt; Hello. I see that your newest ad campaign talks about the Body by Victoria line and says ""A Body for Every Body"". However, in my own experience this is not true.

&gt; My measurements are 25 inches for the underbust and 30 inches for the bust. This puts me at a size 26D. In store, VS associates always measure me incorrectly as a 32A or B by measuring over the bust instead of under, or by adding inches to the underbust measurements. Both of these methods are incorrect. The result is that I end up in the fitting room with a bra that has way too loose of a band, but the associates try to sell me the bra anyway, either because they're trying to make a sale, or because they simply don't know how a bra should fit. It is sad that a company that is supposed to advocate correctly fitting bras trains their associates so poorly, and even teaches incorrect fitting techniques on their website. Is Victoria's Secret planning on correcting these problems?

&gt; As of right now, Victoria's Secret does not actually make bras for every body. They use incorrect and outdated fitting techniques to fit women into a small range of sizes. I realize that it is expensive to stock all the sizes that women actually need, but if it became company-wide policy to train their associates and bra specialists to actually measure correctly, they would find that it is absolutely necessary to stock bras in sizes 28-50 A-J. The cost of stocking these sizes would surely be offset by the multitude of women who would actually be able to purchase bras in their size at a Victoria's Secret.

&gt; The demand for sub-30 bands in the United States is huge. Those of us in this category (and there are many of us) have to resort to purchasing bras from Europe. Wouldn't it make good business sense to be the first American brand to sell bras in sizes 26-30 A-J?

1362878340.0,135,self.ABraThatFits,1a00vm,Hopefully you girls will find this as good for a laugh as I did.,jillcicle,173,38,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/1a00vm/hopefully_you_girls_will_find_this_as_good_for_a/,"So yesterday I saw a woman with the worst back boob I've ever seen. She wasn't even overweight (like the woman in the pictures that Venusian Glow shared awhile ago) yet she had bulging fat sticking out probably 3 or 4 inches on both sides above her band (which was riding up, of course.)

It looked seriously miserable, and I was actually really distressed by it. (I hate always seeing women that I know are in pain but knowing it will be creepy/offensive if I randomly go up and tell them their bra doesn't fit!) So when I got to my boyfriend's apartment, which is where I had been headed, I started ranting about it to him, and got a skeptical look when I said breast tissue can migrate to the back.

So I pulled up the Venusian Glow post (which is [here](http://www.venusianglow.com/2011/12/proof-that-breast-tissue-can-migrate-to.html), btw) and patiently explained all about how this can happen. I told him how overweight women have to feel for a texture difference in the tissue, and how even more slender women will have mysterious rolls there that will actually go back into the breasts once their bra fits right. Eventually, I convinced him, and let the issue drop.

Flash to today. I had gone home after having dinner with him and fallen asleep around 12. I wake up this morning, and have a text from my boyfriend, sent around 3 am (!).

All it says is ""I have back boob!!""

I texted him back, ""What?!"" and got in response ""I have them! So much migration :(""

So long story short, my boyfriend (who is somewhat overweight) was apparently alarmed when I described the back rolls, stayed up late researching them, did the poke test, and is convinced he feels breast tissue back there. 

He is sincerely disturbed by this - I have a hard time not dying of laughter every time he brings it up. I've explained again and again that there is no reason for tissue to have migrated since he hasn't been wearing bras, but he somehow got the idea that since he sleeps on his stomach it probably happens then.

Anyways, this was too good not to share with you ABTFers since you will totally get the humor. ;)

I believe my girlfriend is wearing the wrong size bra, but I don't know how to break it to her.

I don't think she knows about or does the scoop and swoop, she has a lot of overspill on the top, and she seems to constantly be fixing her bras.  She also mentions how the best feeling in the world is taking it off because they're uncomfortable.

What do you think is the best way to tell her that she's wearing the wrong size?  Do you think I should tell her how I found this subreddit and show her some information (a lot of sidebar stuff, before and afters, etc.)?

Like most little girls, I grew up eagerly awaiting puberty.  I was frequently told by adults that this was the magical time when I would get boobs.  Well, puberty came and went.  My areolas got a little bigger, my nipples stuck out a little more, but I never developed anything that even remotely looked like breasts.  I guess the boob fairy missed my house.  
  
  
Like many women with small breasts (or just breasts, period), I've dealt with a never-ending torrent of mockery, shame, and ridicule because of my size.  School was a nightmare, and even as an adult I am frequently made to feel inferior because I don't look the way a ""normal"" woman should.  Women tell me that my clothes would look better if I had breasts to fill them out, or refer to my breasts as manly or childish.  Men joke about my ""tiny titties"" while simultaneously assuring me (unbidden!) that ""some men are into that"".  My female relatives love to comment on how my breasts ""just don't look right"" in dresses when compared to theirs.  And don't even get me started on the time a busty coworker and I accidentally wore the same blouse to a meeting at our male-dominated company.  
  
  
To make a long story short, I am constantly being singled out for being different.  Men and women alike have made me feel as if my lack of breasts is somehow wrong, as if I am not a ""real"" woman.  I do my best to stay confident and ignore what everyone else thinks, but I'll let you all in on a little secret: It hurts.  A lot.  
  
  
So when I came to ABTF and quickly had the ""unicorn"" label slapped across my chest, I was upset.  In a community that prides itself on being a safe and accepting place for women of all sizes, I was once again being made to feel as if I didn't belong.  I know that no one here uses ""unicorn"" to be mean or derogatory.  I understand that it's rare to find someone who actually fits in a size sold in brick and mortar stores, and the ""unicorn"" label reflects that rarity.  I get it.  But at the same time, I am yet again being singled out in a place that I should find welcoming.  Once again I am being made to feel as if I am abnormal or wrong because of my size.  I am not a woman.  I am not even a human. I am a mythical creature.  I am a unicorn.    
  
  
For those that don't know, being a ""unicorn"" is already a huge pain in the ass to begin with.  Sure, it's easier to find bras in my size, but that's where the fun stops.  We constantly take flak from other women, both here at ABTF and in other female-oriented subs, because everyone believes that we cannot possibly be this bra size.  I get it that the majority of women are wearing the wrong size bra and yada, yada, yada, but it gets old REAL fast.  I cannot post anything bra- or breast-related without three or four women jumping down my throat about wearing the wrong bra size.  Even when I assure them that this is in fact my measured size, many will assume that I simply measured incorrectly.  A few have even gone so far as to act superior, treating me as if I'm too stupid to know my own size.  I've hated my breasts since I was twelve years old and all this - on top of the already depressing ""unicorn"" label - definitely does not help.  
  
  
I don't really know what my intention is here.  Maybe I would have done better to post this on r/offmychest.  I don't have a better label in mind for those that fit into conventional bra sizes - though it would be nice if we could just avoid labeling each other altogether.  I guess I just wanted to point out that not everyone appreciates being called a unicorn.  So many women deal with body shaming and ridicule because they are different, I know I can't be the only one who feels this way.

While browsing the racks, I managed to find a couple of bras in my size on the floor. A couple of the sales ladies were scoping me out and offered me some help.

She gave me a few bras in my size and I had a field day. 



A 20 year old lady was in the dressing stall next to me, claiming she used to be a 38D, but she lots a bit of weight and thought she'd need a 36B. I could hear the enthusiasm in my attendant's voice as she told the woman that she was most likely a 32D and asked to measure her. The girl's mother checked on her and tried to convince her that the Norstrom lady was not sizing her properly, but luckily she told her mom that the sizing actually made more sense and she was going to at least give the new sizes a try. 



She tried on a bunch and left with four new bras! I had the poor Nordtrom ladies running all around the floor and the back looking for my size.

I promise that I'm not new to this subreddit!)

For the vast majority of bodies, MWB's guide will get you quite close to your actual size. Please use it and go by it as a first step! This post will be talking about two of the very few exceptions to his wonderful fit guide: women with muscle, and conical breasts. 

__________________________________________________________________________

I have both of these things: I measure 28.5"" underbust and a whopping 36.5"" leaning over. That means that I 'should' be in a 28FF or so, but I can assure you that I am not.

**Proof:**

[Front](http://i.imgur.com/wAWavvA.jpg), [3/4](http://i.imgur.com/HazRHDG.jpg), [Band](http://i.imgur.com/2NGF0pu.jpg), and [Top-down](http://i.imgur.com/MfkXI5t.jpg) views of me in a 30D Ewa Michalak. I have a little bit of escaped breast tissue/armpit fat, but because of my small bust and long torso, it's just going to happen. Going up to a 28FF or 30F would clearly be way too much cup for me.

So why doesn't it work? In my case it's both of the reasons I mentioned, so I will go into a little depth for each:

**A Muscular Back**

If you lift weights, you will get broad lat muscles (case in point: [me flexing](http://i.imgur.com/yeNKKhT.jpg)). That extra muscle makes your back broader around where the nipple line is, and thus where the bust measurement is taken. In the majority of cases, it will be actual breast tissue taking up most of that measurement. But if you are an athlete or lift weights 3+ times a week, you may want to take this into account and try bras with a 'flatter' shape or in a smaller cup size than you measure. You can measure the back half of your back at both the underbust line and the nipple line to see how much of a difference is taken up by your back, rather than your breast tissue.


**Conical Breasts**

The other issue here is conical breasts. A lot of us have seen the ['orange in a glass' post](http://www.venusianglow.com/2012/09/small-breasts-with-broad-base.html) that comes with shallow breasts. Conical breasts are the opposite - they are usually small, with a narrow base and are quite 'pointy'. [Tubular breasts](http://www.beckermd.com/wp-content/uploads/rmgallery_images/large/1168/1%20Patient%20with%20tubular%20breasts.jpg) (NSFW!!) are the extreme version -- clearly she will measure bigger than her actual volume of breast tissue would be able to fill. Conical breasts have the same idea, but to less of an extreme -- instead of looking like ), they look more like &gt; from the side (again -- conical breasts are usually *small*!). Holding the tape measure snugly to give your hanging breast more of a ) shape can help make this measurement more accurate.

_______________________________________________________________________


So what does this mean? It still means that **everyone** should measure according to MWB's guide. I look like an 'A cup', but wear a 28-30 D or DD. Even if that isn't the 28FF I measure as it's also clearly not the 32-34A that I was wearing before I became a bra fitter and then discovered this subreddit.

If you have conical breasts or a lot of muscle, just keep in mind that it take a little longer to find the right size -- don't get a million bras in your new size and blame the subreddit for it not working! Finding the right bra(s) for you takes trial and error, and MWB's guide is just a place to get started. The band measurement will almost always be correct. Getting the cup right takes a little more time!

No way!"" I just told all of them to go to Nordstrom rack and just try it.  A number of them did!  The 34G girl came running up to me the next time she saw me shouting about how she never knew a bra fit so well and how her back has stopped hurting!  At chapter she nominated me for ""sister of the week"" and even showed the whole chapter her new bra!  Since then I get asked to do fittings all the time!  

People are always shocked but after I explain how bra's should fit, why Victoria's secrets has a bad fitting style, and that it's all about a ratio of bust circumference and rib cage circumference, they seem to get it and are much more open to trying it.  Once they try it they never go back!

Do you think you have shallow breasts?  Do you have no clue at all?  Do you not even know what shallow breasts look like? Do you have no idea what kind of bras to buy for shallow breasts?  Well, you've come to the right post, because here I will hopefully answer as many questions as I can regarding shallow breasts with wide roots.

**What are shallow breasts with a wide root?**

Simply put, shallow breasts with a wide root have their breast tissue spread out much more evenly across the chest than most ladies.  While most people have more projection with a smaller base, shallow breasts usually have much less projection across a larger base.  Often, a person with shallow breasts has breast tissue that starts all the way up near the collarbone.

**Okay, so what do shallow breasts with wide roots look like?**

[Here's a diagram of some different shallow breasts vs. someone with more projection](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hnIpeGDU2WE/UEYGVHZOCgI/AAAAAAAAA20/AkCVXUtLzcE/s1600/shallow+breasts.jpg) (mostly SFW).  You'll notice that the slope of the breast starts up much higher than the far right breasts.  In addition, a non-negligible amount of tissue (compared to the total amount of tissue) is underneath that top half of the curve.

**Right, but what do they *really* look like?**

Luckily, Venusian\*Glow has done some of that legwork already!  [Here's some living, breathing examples of shallow breasts](http://www.venusianglow.com/2013/03/examples-of-shallow-breasts-nsfw.html) (Very NSFW).  You'll notice in 3/4 and profile shots that there is a smooth curve from the collarbone down to the nipple on every person, but there doesn't seem to be much projection going on.

**What are some other possible indicators of shallow breasts with wide roots?**

* Many bras, especially plunges, cut into your breast tissue at the top edge of the cup, but you never seem to be able to fill out the cup itself.
* The bra size you come up with using [The Guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/rh26h/is_getting_fitted_for_a_bra_as_humiliating_as_it/c469bi0) seems to be giving you a size that is much too large from what you look like.  Note: this is different than the sticker shock of learning your new size (for example, going from a 36D to a 32FF).  What I mean is that when you look at other people who wear the same size bra as you, they seem to have much bigger breasts.
* Professional fitters often get your band size correct, but severely underestimate your cup size.
* Shallow shapes are extremely common in cupsizes A-E and bandsizes 28-32.  However, shallow breasts outside that range are definitely not unheard of.
* Unlined bras rarely work for you, and you prefer your bras to have some sort of lining or padding.
* You are trans*\.
* You would describe your breasts as more teardrop-shaped than round/spherical.

**What are some things to look for when choosing a bra?**

Finding bras that work for ladies with shallow breasts and wide roots is a challenge.  Most bras have too much projection, which creates an [""orange-in-a-glass"" appearance](http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/15skno/the_bras_in_my_supposed_size_fit_weird_and_im_not/c7phuxw).  Specifically, here's some indicators that the bra you're looking at might work for you:

* The cups have only vertical seams, and no horizontal seams.  [Good](http://i.imgur.com/0BSxigO.jpg) vs. [bad](http://i.imgur.com/efjgH3q.jpg) (diagrams), [good](http://i.imgur.com/JK2kSms.jpg) vs. [bad](http://i.imgur.com/VkWxHMt.jpg) (actual bras).
* The top edge of the cups is as close to horizontal as possible.  [Good](http://i.imgur.com/wM96Dar.jpg) vs. [bad](http://i.imgur.com/GScMlM5.jpg).
* The top edge is open (vertical), not closed (curved in towards the body).  [Good](http://www.bratabase.com/browse/lepel/fiore-balcony-93208/30E/pictures/) vs. [bad](http://www.bratabase.com/browse/chantelle/rive-gauche-3-part-cup-3281/pictures/).

Please note: these are just suggestions.  Many bras that follow these guidelines won't work for shallow breasts, and many bras that follow none of these guidelines *do* work for shallow breasts.  Your best bet is to look up reviews and measurements on [Bratabase](http://www.bratabase.com/).  When there doesn't seem to be much data available on the bra you're looking at, refer back to these three points for guidance.

Also note: many bras labeled as *balconette* follow the three guidelines above, and generally work for shallow breasts.  However, balconettes generally do not work for ladies who wear a larger cup size but are still shallow.

**Alright then, what are some examples of bras that will probably work?**

* Ewa Michalak HP Bad Girl
* Freya Carys longline
* Freya Just Flew In padded longline
* Lepel Fiore Padded Balconette
* Natori Feathers contour plunge

**What are some examples of bras that have *not* worked for the shallow breasted community?**

* b.tempt'd How Gorgeous
* Cleo Meg
* Freya Deco Half Cup
* Lepel Georgette
* Masquerade Delphi
* Panache Tango II
* Curvy Kate Tease Me

**What are some brands that have a higher chance of working?**

* Betsey Johnson
* Chantelle
* Ewa Michalak
* Lepel

**What are some brands that haven't worked very well for this community?**

* Curvy Kate
* Elle MacPherson

* Panache

**Are these bras sold in brick and mortar stores?**

If you weren't already aware, the only chain stores in the United States that sells bras beyond the [bra matrix](http://www.venusianglow.com/2008/04/bra-matrix.html) is Nordstrom, Nordstrom Rack, and Dillards.  Nordstrom sells 30+ bands and cups A-J (UK).  However, a majority of the bras they sell do not work well for shallow breasts.  If you are smaller than a 30E (UK), you only have Betsey Johnson demis to try on.  If your cup size is an E or larger, then you only have Freya's padded half cups available to try on.  If you wear a 32E or a 34E (UK), you have both lines to try on.  Beyond those, most of the bras they sell will probably not work for shallow breasts.  Note: this information is from Nordstrom's website, and is accurate as of May 2013.

**Is there any way that bras that don't generally work for shallow/wide breasts can be made into shallower- and wider-cupped bras?**

This idea is in its infancy, but there are some suggestions that when you go up sister sizes, the cup of the bra becomes a bit wider and shallower.  Several people have considered buying bras that are 3 or more sister sizes larger, then altering them down to the correct band size.  Along these lines, if you find that a bra is just on the cusp of being too narrow and/or too deep, consider going up a sister size.  Caveat: this will work much less often for shorter people, as the straps will be set too wide in the back, and will be much more prone to falling down.  Here is [the blog post that kick-started this idea](http://blog.butterflycollection.ca/2013/04/what-sister-size-bras-look-like.html).  As more people experiment and document this theory, I hope to update this section with more information and links.

**Here are two Google Docs Spreadsheets in which you can view the data analysis I have done:**

I wear size 12 pants. And my underbust measurement is 31 inches. 

For years, I heard my friends that weighed 110 lbs tell me their band size was a 32. I had other friends that wore 3 or 4 clothing sizes smaller than me tell me that their band size was a 36. It was drilled into me, just like it's drilled into most of us, that 32 bands are only worn by itsy-bitsy skinny girls. Curvy girls? There's no way we could be less than a 36 or 38 band. So how could I, at 175 lbs, possibly need a 32 band? I spent years in a 36 band, because that was what made sense. If I weight 60 lbs more than my friend in the 32, then surely I must be at least 4 inches bigger than her, right?

But, in reality, I measure 31 inches around my underbust. And most of my friends wearing a 32 probably need closer to a 28 or 26. Girls, I'm telling you: even if you think that there is no way you are skinny enough to need a band as small as what that measuring tape is telling you.. BELIEVE IT!

**Please donât be afraid to ask for help!** This is merely an effort to make it clear what things are helpful to include in such a request. If all you know are your measurements and that you have been wearing a 36DD from Victoria's Secrets, that is totally fine!

**1)** It is recommended that you put the brand(s) and the size(s) into the **title of your post**. For example, ""Fit check for Freya in 30FF please"" will get the attention of people who wear Freya or sizes close to 30FF. ""Help me with my bras!"" won't. 

**2) Give your measurements,** at the very least loose underbust and bust standing and leaning forward. Underbust as tight as possible, bust measured lying flat on your back would also be useful. 

Nice additional info would be height, age, implants, post breast-reduction, pigeon breast, funnel chest, being X weeks pregnant, being a nursing mom with child X weeks/months of age, breast cancer, dynomastia, short anything that might be relevant. 

**3) Make a list of all the bras** you have tried. Start with **brand, model, size**. (UK/US/EU/FR?) Describe what you like and what you don't like about each bra, where it is comfortable and where it isn't. 

Are the wires too wide or too narrow, sitting on breasttissue hurting you? How is the height of the wires under the arms, do you get poked there? How is gore height, gore width? Do you get quadboob, are the straps rubbing you, ...? Do you must have this bra no matter how bad the fit bc the neckline is the only one that is low enough to go under your prom dress? 

**Please make your descriptions as detailed as possible. If you are not comfortable with posting photos, your descriptions are the only thing we have. If you post pictures, the description will give us essential info on fit.** 

If you can, **enter the bras into bratabase** so that we can take a look at the measurements. 

If you try the bras at a store, it is a good idea to take pictures of the label, write down brand, model and size and then take pictures of yourself in the bra. You don't have to show the pictures to anybody, but it helps you to remember the bras later. 

**4)** Bratabase is an ideal tool to keep track of what you have tried. If you diligently entered all your bras from your order(s) into bratabase, measured them and set fit it is very easy to just give a link to your bratabase profile along with some additional descriptions of your fit problems. This way you don't get suggestions for bras that you have already tried and were a bad fit. 

**5)** Photos are the easiest, but drawings can be good alternatives if you don't feel comfortable posting pictures of yourself in a bra. A scribbling in Paint or Gimp is often more helpful in explaining a fit issue then trying to describe it. There are also some nifty filters that can turn photos into drawings. 

**6)** If you include pictures, make sure you swoop and scoop. Then take them this way:

Position the lense at bra height. Put your hands on your hips. Take the following shots:

- Right profile, 
- 45 degree angle shot from the right side, 
- frontal view, 
- 45 degree angle shot from the left side, 
- profile view from the left side, 
- backview/ band length
- close-ups of certain problem areas.

At the very least do profile on the larger side, 45 degree angle on the larger side and front view. **It is impossible to tell fit from just one frontal or one profile shot.** 

Make sure the wires are visible in profile view or 45 degree angle view. Do not lift your arms above shoulder height for profile view, it skews the fit of the bra and makes quadboob dissappear. Put your hands on your hips instead. 

If you use a digital camera with a display, point the lense at your body and watch the display in a mirror. 

**Show pictures of all bras that you have tried, including the really bad ones.** Often it is the bad ones that are essential for diagnosing fit problems.  Unpadded and unmoulded bras are best for fit requests. ""Foam domes"" might be hard to diagnose.

If you show pictures of a dark bra, you might want to lighten the picture and play around with the contrast so that the wire channel is visible.  Cut pictures to leave out most of the background. Navel to neck and upper arms need to be visible, the unmade bed behind you doesn't. 

If you use imgur, let imgur automatically resize the pictures to message board size. As for posting links, it is better to post one link to an imgur album than several different links to various pictures. Label the pictures with brand, model, size please.

**7)** If you have questions about the fit of the bras, put them at the end of the text.

Thanks.

I've taken the liberty of putting together a [preliminary template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0All9dJ16LCzBdGNwVmV1QW4zakYxNXhoQ3BleG92MGc&amp;usp=sharing) of what such a database could look like.  My thought is that it would simply be a yes/no answer to whether the bra works well for various cup-size ranges, breast shapes, shallowness, etc.  So I'm wondering:

* Does a database/spreadsheet like the one I linked make sense to you?
* Does a dichotomous yes/no make sense? Would a ""fit scale"" (e.g., 1 to 5) make more sense? Something else?
* Should the cup size ranges, breast shape, shallowness, etc. differ from what I've laid out? (E.g., does it make sense to have cup size ranges in 3 categories of A-D, DD-G, GG+?)
* Are there other characteristics that you'd like to be included in this type of database?

Also, and more importantly, what does this subreddit think the best approach for flushing out this database (or a different version of it) would be?  I think some information (i.e., if a bra fits shallow breasts could be borrowed from /u/ankylosaurus_rex's shallow breast guide if she's amenable to this, but what about the other categories?

Thoughts, ideas?

There is nothing wrong or shameful about bare breasts, but we should probably work on discouraging the creepers as much as we can which is why we don't encourage bare breasts to begin with and why I'm suggesting nipples get edited out (honestly don't feel like it will do much, but I feel like we should try). What do you think?~~ OK first rule is out, I'm going to mention something about possibly editing out nipples, but I'm not going to enforce a rule about it.

On that same note, if you do not want creepers to stalk your account, please, USE A THROWAWAY. We cannot stop them from sending you PMs. Some women do not mind the creepy PMs, they can just ignore them, but if you think that kind of thing will get under your skin do not use your main account when posting here, especially if you are posting pictures, use an account whose history you don't mind ditching should worse come to worst and you find yourself stuck with a persistent creeper (don't mean to scare you though, that doesn't happen often, most you'll never hear from again if you just ignore/block them). It seems the number of creepy PMs people have been receiving has increased both here and /r/bigboobproblems, if you receive a creepy PM and want to do something about it rather than just ignore it, this is what you should do: 

1. Take a screen shot of the PM, and send it to the moderators using the ""message the moderators"" link, we will then ban that user from posting on this subreddit (if you frequent /r/bigboobproblems or /r/smallboobproblems or anything like that it would be a good idea to send the screen shot to those mods as well). This first step is kind of optional, to tell the truth it really doesn't do much because the people sending creepy PMs don't usually post here.

2. Click the report link under the PM to report the user to the reddit admin, and then 

3. block the user so that you no longer have to receive messages from them. 

Another optional step is to post the screen shot over in /r/creepyPMs if you feel like it. =P

On to proposed new rule #2: I think we should make it against the rules to post pictures women have put up of themselves on other parts of reddit (such as in any of the gonewild subreddits or anywhere else), as well as pictures of any other normal, non-celebrity/model women in ill-fitting bras. They didn't ask to be scrutinized in this manner, or for an example to be made of out them. Even if the intentions are good, its unlikely any woman that stumbles across this subreddit and sees a picture of herself being commented on is going to feel good about it. If I was in that position I would probably be ashamed and mortified, ""was it really that bad that out of every other girl wearing a bra that doesn't fit, mine is the one you chose as the bad example?"" is probably what would be going through my head in that situation. Even if the chances are one in a million that person will see the post its just not a good thing to do. Thoughts? Comments? I'm kind of in a grey area  as far as the celebrity pics go. If you all feel very strongly about these posts and really like them, maybe they would be better in a separate subreddit, something like r/brasthatdon'tfit, or perhaps /r/bigboobproblems has enough of them to satisfy your needs?

We *DO* need resources to show what bad bras look like though, please, if you can and feel comfortable with it, contribute some before/after pictures to the [Before and After Thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/15qnxl/before_and_after_sizes/) and add your story there too if you haven't yet. =) Some other resources we would love to get your help with: 

1. [Bratabase's Breast Shape Gallery](http://www.bratabase.com/blog/2012/nov/21/determining-your-breast-shape-202/), 

2. [The Perfectly Fitted Bra Project](http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/1at3x9/psa_the_bra_band_project_is_expanding_and_we_need/), 

3. Scoop and Swoop photos, what we would love is some photos just like the ones in the [Bras and Body Image post](http://brasandbodyimage.wordpress.com/2012/09/05/putting-your-bra-on-properly/), but of women in various sizes to show that women with small chests and medium chests benefit from it too so that we can add it to the Busty Resources Wiki

4. As always, continue adding your bras and measurements into [Bratabase](http://www.bratabase.com/), even if they don't fit!

5. If you know of any other projects going on right now in the bra fitting community please mention it, I'll add it to this list. Also, if we discussed something of this nature and I said I was going to add it into my next mod post but forgot to mention it, please remind me, I feel like I spoke to a lot of people about a lot of different stuff and if I forgot something I apologize.

Finally, a new rule about manufacturers and retailers: If you are a manufacturer or a retailer, and you wish to make an account on our subreddit, please notify the mods of your user name, we will then give you a ""Manufacturer Account"" or ""Retailer Account"" tag. You will only be allowed to post and comment on very specific things so that we can minimize spam and so that we have as little company influence on our sub as possible, please contact the Mods for more details if this applies to you.

The poor bras are almost up to her neck and are worn to death.

I managed to measure my grandmother yesterday and talk her into joining me on a shopping spree today. The numbers pointed to 36F but going down to a 38 band was a big enough change for her already. 

We headed to Change that had been picked clean already as they're having their big biannual sale but I managed to find [a white full coverage bra](http://change.com/int/sofia-1.html) in 38E that worked wonders. It's fantastic at containing really soft (I've heard them being desribed even as liquid) breasts like my grandmothers. There was nothing else left in her size (but I did spy an overflow of 30 and 28 bands in small cups) on sale and she categorically refused to pay more than â¬20 per bra. I'm really happy I talked her into trying an underwired bra, she had been so uncomfortable with badly fitting underwires she insisted on something wireless but she couldn't have been happier with the lift and support once she tried something close to a great fit.

As there was nothing else even close to fitting in Change we stopped by Triumph. They were also having a sale so selection wasn't the greatest either but after scouring the racks my grandmother fell in love with a taupe/lilac embroidered full cup bra.

As I've started losing weight, I decided that it's time to get a bra and get properly fitted (I never had before) and then I stumbled across this subreddit. According to the measurements here, I've gone from being a 36C to a 36FF! I still haven't tried a bra on in that size (I haven't even seen a bra that size in Australia!) but I definitely will within this week. Anyway, onto the actual part that I'm mad about!

I mentioned to my mum how I measured myself and came out as a 36FF and she immediately scoffed. I tried explaining to her that the cup size only is a representation of the difference in inches between your band size and bust size, but she wouldn't have any of that. She told me I might be a D instead, but definitely not a FF. My mum then told me to ask my aunty, who owns a few bra stores in the state I live in, to get me fitted. Sure enough, I went on their website the lo behold, the fitting guide not only says to add on 4"" to an even band size and 5"" to an odd one, but it also recommends to measure when wearing a bra! It just makes me so frustrated that they even claim to all be fully qualified bra fitters on their site when they're part of the reason why 80% of women are wearing the wrong size. 

I'm now on a mission to prove my mum wrong, who insists that FF cups only will cover my entire breast and/or won't even fit. To make things even better, she told my dad about it and he also insisted I'm C cup because 'if I had FF cup boobs, they'd be enormous'. 

But yes, sorry about that little rant, I just had to get it out.

And she's perfect. And for 4 months I breastfed (until work/babynursingstrike made it too difficult). After that, I didn't have the slightest clue as to what size I was. I was wearing 2 regular bras, each a different size, with broken elastic, and 2 sports bras every day just to feel like I had some kind of support. I FINALLY managed to save enough money to go buy new bras. God, I was so stoked. I literally hadn't been that excited in weeks.

Until I walked into Lane Bryant.

Now let me just say, I'm not one to back down from a fight, and I'm not a naturally shy person. But put me in a room full of tall busty women who seem confident as hell and act like they know what they're doing, and I shrink. And to be honest, sales people have always been really intimidating to me. So after staring at bras, thinking about how I don't know where to even start, I finally got up enough courage to go over to the woman in charge of the fitting room and try to explain my situation. She cuts me short and asks what size I'm currently wearing. When I told her I was actually wearing 4 bras, she laughed, looked me dead in the eye and said 'Good lord girl, you're a mess.'

I was fucking mortified. As if that wasn't bad enough, she then told me to put my arms out at my sides and measured me right then and there. In the middle of the fitting rooms, in front of about 10 people, OVER THE 4 BRAS I HAD JUST TOLD HER I WAS WEARING. I couldn't believe it. But I was so shocked and embarrassed that when she glanced at the tape measure (after going around part of my boobs once, and looking at it AFTER she pulled it off) and told me that I was a '38DDD', I went and found two in that size. I tried them on and it didn't feel quite right, but when she rapped on the door and asked how it was going, and I told her I didn't think it was right, she told me I 'just didn't know what a good bra felt like.' 
The whole time, I just wanted to cry. She wasn't listening, I was frustrated, but I NEEDED a bra in the worst way possible. So, I walked out of there, 2 bras richer, $70 poorer, and 100% more defeated than I was earlier that day.

Not too long ago, a very, very wonderful friend of mine told me about this subreddit. And today, I finally measured myself going off of the Self-measuring guide and came up with a 36H. A huge fucking world of difference. And I'm planning on going by the end of the month (with a friend, so I don't get bullied into the same situation) to get new bras that ACTUALLY fit.

I'd previously been wearing 40D or 42C bras that the gore didn't tack, they were loose, boobs would fall below the underwire, etc.  But because I had ""space"" I thought they were all too big.

Found this subreddit, did some measuring, and came up with more like a 38H or 40G as my size.  I thought ""hell.  No.  I am not that big!""  But figured it was worth a shot as my current bras suck.

Spent some quality time at Lane Bryant and with the swoop and scoop, realized that DDD's were actually too small, but my local Lane Bryant didn't have any bigger.  (And the lady there was quite rude, telling me that ""I couldn't possibly be that big.)

So yesterday, I went to Dillards.  Not only were they nice and professional and knew what they were talking about, they didn't even bat an eye when I said I was there to try 38H and 40G's.  They went and rounded up one of almost every style they had, and actually helped with fit.  The lady rejected bras before I did, saying ""the gore isn't sitting right on that"" and ""this shape is totally wrong for your breast tissue"".  

I heard them telling a poor girl who'd been in a 36D that her real size was a 28J, and that she'd be better off trying to find her size online.  (What?  A store recognizing that they don't have what their customer needs and directing them to someone who does?)  

They taught the lady in the next room to scoop and swoop, and told her that the ""fat"" in her armpits was because her bra didn't fit.

And they told me when their next major sale is going to be (June 5th) so that I could save money when I wanted to buy more.  

Overall, I'm really pleased with my experience.  I hadn't really shopped at Dillard's before and I was really surprised by how knowledgable and friendly they were.  And my new bra is really comfy and flattering!

Updated 16 March, many thanks to t_maia and others who gave suggestions :-)

**Note Well:**

80% of women are wearing the wrong bra size, and many do not even know it. It is EXTREMELY important that the sports bra is the correct size otherwise it will not support you properly during exercise. There is no point in buying a good sports bra if it does not fit you properly. Use [this fitting guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/rh26h/is_getting_fitted_for_a_bra_as_humiliating_as_it/c469bi0) to find your size, and buy that size (but note that some bands run tight and you may have to size up accordingly, go down one cup size each time you go up a band size. For example, if you're a 32C and want to wear a 34 band you would choose a 34B) and please visit /r/ABraThatFits if you are having trouble with the measurements or have any additional questions.


**I. Types**

- Compression: As the name suggests, a compression sports bra works by compressing your breast tissue. [Here](http://www.championusa.com/workout-clothes/sports-bras-43553--1/high-support-bras/champion-double-dry-sweetheart-compression-sports-bra) is an example of a typical compression bra. They often come in sizes like S, M, L, XL. These are not generally recommended for larger busts because they do not provide proper support. There are some exceptions which are listed in part II.

- Encapsulation: This type usually has wires, is more supportive than a compression bra, and keeps the breasts in place during vigorous activity. These are sized like regular bras: 32E, 38F, 30G, etc.

**II. Recommended Brands, Models, and Sizes Available**

- [Panache Sports Bra](http://www.panache-lingerie.com/GB/panache-sport/collection/21540843/Sports-Bra/) 
Sizes 28DD-H, 30D-H, 32C-H, 34, 36, 38D-H, 40D-GG (encapsulation) 
Fit issues: For those with a narrow root and a lot of projection, the Freya Active bras or the Bravissimo Sports bra might be the better choice.

- [Freya Active](http://www.freyalingerie.com/active/sports/underwired-sports-bra/underwired_sports_bra.aspx?colour=black%20samba) 
28D-G, 30-38 D-H (encapsulation) Fit issues- runs small, size up in the band

28D-J, 30-36 D-K, 38D-JJ, 40D-J (encapsulation) Good for lower impact exercise. Fit issues- runs large in the cup, it is shallow, and allows a lot of volume in the upper cup

- [Shock Absorber Brand- Various models](http://www.freshpair.com/womens/Shock-Absorber.html)

       a) N109/B109/SN109 30-40 D-G, 32-38 GG/H (encapsulation, pointy shape, good support)

       b) B4490/S4490 - 32-34 A, 32-38 B/C, 28-40 D-HH (compression, widest size range)

       d) B4246/S 4246 SA Padded 32-38 A-D (very good for small breasts with shallow shape)

Fit issues: as a rule ShockAbsorber runs tight in the band, many go up in band size, especially if you are in between band sizes. If you are looking at a black bra, go up in band size. 

Some options for larger band sizes:

- [Elomi Energise](http://www.elomilingerie.com/lingerie/best_sellers/energise.aspx) 34GG-J, 36DD-J 38D-J, 40D-HH, 42D-H, 44D-GG, 46D-DD (encapsulation) Fit issues- Some report needing to size down in the cup compared to their normal size in Elomi.

- [Enell Sport](http://enell.com/enell-sport) Encapsulation and compression. Custom sizes available up to 52 bands. Contact their customer service department (may take a while for custom order as only one woman is making the custom bras, but it is worth it if you are sized out of other bras.  Fit issues- Enell uses their own sizing system, so use the sizing guide on their website. 

Additional options for cup sizes below D:  

- [Under Armour Sports Bras](http://www.underarmour.com/shop/us/en/womens/apparel/sports-bras) has several styles that address high, medium, and low impact needs. Wireless and compression. 

- looking for suggestions!

**III. Additional Info**

- Generally choose your regular size for encapsulation sports bras unless otherwise noted. Use [this guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/rh26h/is_getting_fitted_for_a_bra_as_humiliating_as_it/c469bi0) if you are unsure of your size. By nature, sports bras are tighter than regular bras, and some women may choose to size up in the band for comfort. If you size up in the band, decrease the cup size by one letter.

- [Review of several models](http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/163ceb/lets_talk_sports_bras/c7sl088) by skyaerobabe

- more reviews would be nice!

- Search for these brands at the online retailers often suggested here for regular bras, like Brastop.com, Figleaves.com, Herroom.com, etc., if you don't have access to a regular store that carries these brands. [Here](http://bustyresources.wikia.com/wiki/Online_retailer) is a more comprehensive list of online retailers by country. You might find some good deals on Ebay.com and Ebay.co.uk.

- Sports bras are generally not appropriate for regular daily wear. [More info on this](http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/182yue/is_wearing_a_sports_bra_constantly_bad_and_how_do/c8bbloi) by t_maia

So you have some new, well-fitting bras that cost a pretty penny. Now how do you take care of them so they last as long as possible? This guide aims to show you the proper way to care for your bras to get the most out of them!

##General Wear Care

* wear your bra every other day at most to let the elastic relax
* wash your bra after 3 wears - you can stretch it, but it's not advised as your body's natural oils cause degradation in fabrics
* however, you can wash as often as you'd like - it won't damage your bra as long as you are gentle
* don't squeeze or otherwise distort moulded cup bras - this encourages wrinkles to develop on the surface

##Washing

#**Lingerie Washes**

Use a handwash lingerie wash only! Detergents and soaps are too harsh on the elastic. You can read more about detergents, soaps, and lingerie washes [over here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/1bdiyt/lets_talk_about_detergents_and_other_cleaning/)! Here are some brands that ABTF [has suggested](http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/159as0/recommendations_for_gentle_lingerie_detergent/):

* [Eucalan](http://www.eucalan.com/)
* [Soak](http://www.soakwash.com/)
* [Forever New](http://www.forevernew.com/)
* [Orvus Soap](http://www.joann.com/orvus-quilt-soap-8-ounce/prd34638/)
* [Laundress Delicate Wash](https://store.thelaundress.com/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&amp;Store_Code=TL&amp;Category_Code=125delWash)

#**Hand washing**

Different linergie washes have different washing instructions, but here is the general way it goes:

* fill sink with enough lukewarm water to submerge bras fully
* put in lingerie wash - often just a squeeze of the bottle or a spoonful of powder
* [submerge bras fully](http://imgur.com/xjwzf) and let soak for ~10-15 minutes - you may need to weigh them down [with something heavy](http://imgur.com/DqceK)
* depending on the brand used, you may wish to gently rub areas that touch your body to clean your bras
* if for some reason, you need to get out stains or other dirt, use a toothbrush to gently scrub
* drain sink of water
* [gently push on bras against the sink](http://imgur.com/YWhp0) to release extra water - DO NOT WRING, especially for moulded cups!
* place bras in [a single layer](http://imgur.com/FMIEA) on a dry towel, [roll up](http://imgur.com/VwIT5), and press gently to release more water
* gently stretch the wire channels to prevent shrinking

#**Special Moulded Cup Notes**

* when squeezing out water, always [push in the direction of the cup](http://imgur.com/IKr9I), don't distort the shape
* try to do all moulded cups together to prevent accidental distortion
* when putting moulded cups in a towel, orient them in a way that [the cups sit in one other](http://imgur.com/YVCT1) when rolled up, and gently push them in the direction of the cup

#**Machine Washing**

Using a machine is not recommended, because they will agitate the bras and cause faster deterioration, but if done properly, there will be minimal damage caused by the machine.

* make sure you are still using a handwash or delicates wash!
* do not wash bras with items that could pull at the straps, hooks, or lace
* close all bras on the tightest hook to prevent accidental pulling
* put all bras in a mesh lingerie bag
* you can also try a [bra ball](http://braballs.com/) but they look questionable at best, and don't fit many sizes
* wash only on the ""delicate"" cycle - other cycles will be too rough


#**Drying**

There are many different ""ways"" to dry bras, but if you only take home one thing, it is to NEVER put your bras in a dryer! Heat will damage the elastic and cause it to break down quicker, as well as cause distortion! Here are a few suggestions for drying:

* hang to dry on a clothes rack or [on hangers](http://imgur.com/SGMCP)
* pin to a clothes line
* lay flat on a water-resistant surface (e.g. a coffee table, not your shag carpet)


##Storage

There are a variety of ways to store your bras! It all depends on your personal wardrobe space and how you like to organize your clothing. Here are some suggestions and tips to consider for keeping your bras in their best condition:

* hang bras from clothes hangers by both straps
* clip bras to skirt hangers
* hook bra closed and lay flat in a dresser - you can save space by folding soft cups in half, but don't do that for moulded cups!
* hang bras from clothes hangers by the gore (my personal lazy method)


##Travel Care

* always close bras when travelling to prevent accidentally damaging bras
* carry in a mesh lingerie bag or other separate, breathable bag - this protects the bras when things shift in your travel bag, and a breathable bag prevents smells from concentrating on the way back home
* put moulded cup bras in a plastic container to prevent squishing the cups - in this instance, you can put one cup in another for space's sake

##Bonus Tips and Tricks

* if you're feeling extra lazy, you can wear your bra to the shower and gently shampoo it - not ideal, but it'll do
* wash all like colours together to prevent fading - though I'm usually too lazy to do so
* you can also make colours last longer by matching the bra colour to your shirt colour
* when putting your bra on, don't twist the wires - it causes damage to the wire and to the wire channel
* there are a ton of other tips in the comments - feel free to add your own, as well!

Not sure how this post will be received.

I'm actually a dude who's always felt a little out of place with his gender. Never enough to go so far as a sex change, but the urge is there. I cross dress a bit, but only in secret. I love bras, but I've always wondered how women stand wearing them because they're so uncomfortable! I have a little bit of breast tissue, but the only bras I could fit into before were AA or AAA cups.

So I come to ABTF and measure myself. I get 35"" under the bust and 37"" over. My inclination before this community would have been to go with a 36"" band, but now I know that's wrong. With some experimentation, I've found that 34A bras fit me really well... I'm guessing I'm not a larger cup size because there's not a lot filling my breasts, so they measure up a lot more when I'm leaning over according to MWB's guide. It's pretty damn amazing to have a bra size that isn't completely niche or meaningless.

Today was my first day wearing my new 36A bra all day, and wow, I can't believe it. It's been comfortable all day and actually feels like it does something to my chest. Many people may not understand, but I feel more like who I was meant to be by having that.

It was just 36 B, it always had been - and always would be. Turns out through measuring that I'm a 34 DD. Which umm. Wow! 

I've got scars from my wires digging into me and drawing blood; I figured that was normal. I mean, people complain about their bras hurting and being uncomfortable all the time right? Shirts never fit me right in the bust, but I always assumed the shirt was messed up or something. I'd read about busty ladies having the same issues that I have; but it never occurred to me that they might be for the same reason. Even tho they're on me, and I see them daily, I still thought they were as tiny as my past tormentors had declared them to be...



Went to Macy's today and spent a very strange hour just trying on every bra in the 34 DD range that I could put my grubby hands on. I felt fantastic. It seems so strange, but ever since I got home w/ this new fitting bra on I feel very confident. I want to show off my boobs to the world and it is a very strange feeling. How can a couple of numbers and letters make me feel this way? They're the same boobs they were yesterday! 

But I suppose the wrapping paper is nicer today...

I'm just very excited, and I wanted to share with you guys and say thank you for this very unexpected confidence boost.

I knew they were too small on me but I didn't have the money to buy new ones as I'm on a very tight budget, and I had no idea what my size was. I was measured once when I was about 15, at Macy's, and they just measured me over my bra. I'm pretty sure I have **never** worn the right size. 

When I went to go visit my boyfriend this past weekend he took me into the city to go ""pick out my Christmas present."" I had no idea where we were going but we ended up in front of a small lingerie store and I figured out what my present was. To say I was ecstatic is an extreme understatement. The store was [Coeur Intimate Apparel &amp; Toys](http://coeurlingerie.com/) in Philadelphia and I have nothing but AMAZING things to say about it. 

We didn't know this, but they were closed on Sundays when we got there. The woman who owns the store and runs it, Mona, was so sweet and acommodating. I told her I was from out of town and would be leaving the next day so she took me into the back and told me she would do a fitting for me in the store no problem, even though they were technically closed. Before she even had me take my bra off, she told me everything I should know about how a bra should fit; a lot of the same stuff you find on here, i.e. support comes from the band not the straps, band size and cup size and not independent, scoop and swoop, etc. 

An hour later, I had 2 bras that fit me better than I could ever imagine a bra fitting me. I was nearly in tears I was so happy. I know it sounds silly how happy I was over this, but in in the 10 years that I have been wearing bras, I have never been comfortable and have always hated the way my breasts looked. For the first time in my life, I felt comfortable and loved the way my bras fit me. I was practically jumping around the store and hugging my boyfriend, thanking him over and over. 

The bras I have been wearing were 40Ds. I walked out with 2 bras that were 36Es. My jaw hit the floor when she told me the size of the bra I was wearing that fit me like a glove.

This was a big move for me, I hate going to fancy stores, I feel out of place and awkward, and I knew I'd have to talk to an associate. I was expecting a battle but dammit I wanted a bra that fit.

I tried to sneak in to the bra section and just find the freya and panache section, no luck. I got the courage to ask someone and, boy, I chose the right person. That girl was *awesome*. 

I told her straight up that I needed 34GG possibly G, she didn'ft give me crazy eyes and declare I must be wrong, took me right to the dressing room with an armful of bras. Brought in a bunch of 34GG and even a 36G just in case. When my 36DDD was revealed she instantly said ""Oh yeah that's not working for you at all."" 

She was intelligent, not pushy,  checked all the right parts of the bra(gore, straps, band, underwire), and even made sure I was scooping and swooping. I was amazed. If I'd had this help when I was first trying on bras as a teenager, my boobie life would have been so much better. I walked out with 2 bras and a new sports bra(the panache one) and am currently sporting one of them now.

Now its obvious that before we can start making this subreddit better information wise we should be working on making it a bit kinder. 

Listen, I understand how frustrating it can be seeing someone post about bras and the information is wrong or not explained properly or based on those myths like ""D cups are huge"" that we all hate. I've certainly gotten frustrated enough to try and argue with them before. But hate mail and that kind of thing is not ok. I realize that it can be hard to draw a line between what is ok to say and what is not ok, but I hope that right now we can all sort of sit and think about what is going on here for a moment and take a step back and realize that maybe we took it a bit too far this time. I don't want to come off as if I'm trying to scold anyone, but I really love this subreddit and I want to see everyone here being welcomed and treated nicely, I want everyone that comes in contact with us to leave thinking we were fantastic and that they want to check it out again tomorrow.

 In regards to OblivionsMemories, was it her fault she didn't know everything there ever was to know about bras? I don't think so. She may have even acted nasty in response to what was said to her but lets face it, she was getting tons and tons of comments, tons and tons of downvotes, and apparently hate mail as well, all criticizing her at once. Of *course* she's going to start feeling defensive and angry and upset. And we did that to her. Just because she stated that Playtex sold more C cup bras than any other cup sizes and referred to big breasts as gazoombas. 

Next time you see someone trying to give their advice about bras, of course its ok to ask them questions and try and direct them to /r/ABraThatFits, in fact I try and do that all the time. Arguing about it a little bit is ok too. I've done it, we've all done it, sometimes it is unavoidable. But I think we should stop posting these kinds of things here. All it does is encourage us to all gang up on one person, and I doubt doing that is going to make them want to come here and join our community. I think maybe we can all, myself included I can totally admit that, work on holding back a bit. Maybe instead of going into long rants and starting arguments we can try to remember that these are people too, and how would I feel if someone came up to me and told me I was totally wrong about something I feel I know a lot about? A more constructive way might be, "" huh, thats not the way I understand it to work, maybe stop by /r/ABraThatFits and check out the way we do it =) "" I can only imagine how awful I would feel if I was in her position, I don't think any of us would want to be in it. So why was it alright to do that to her and put her there? I think this community is above that kind of thing, especially the hate mail.

My bras have never fit very well, and I just always assumed it was because I had some personal physical flaw unlike other ladies.  The straps would slide off, and you could fit a cantaloupe between the band and my back.  I always thought of myself as a small-chested woman who's a bit flabby, and whose stomach sticks out farther than her chest.  I always had armpit pooch and hated wearing tank tops or sleeveless dresses for that reason.

Well, I used MyWifesBusty's guide and it told me I was a 32DDD.  WTF?  I was in disbelief.  I put it out of my mind for a few weeks and today I decided on a whim to try out a 32DDD.  It was hard to find that size, but I eventually landed at Dillard's.  Their bras are pricey, but I had some spare cash, so I thought I'd at least try them on.  I found these pretty lacy underwire bras by Wacoal in 32DDD.

When I pulled the bra off the rack I actually startled the sales girl because I laughed at the cup size.  It was so huge!  I was certain my boobs would be floating in it.  

I warily headed to the dressing room and gathered my breast tissue into the bra, per MyWifesBusty's instructions.  And then...

MY BREASTS LOOK FREAKING AMAZING!  No more armpit pooch, no back flab, no side bump of fat, incredible posture, and boobs that are perky and stick out farther than my stomach.  I look slim and trim and my shoulders are held back with pride.  The comfort and security of feeling snugly bundled into this bra is what I imagine babies must feel when they're swaddled.  

Anyway, I just wanted to say thanks to MyWifesBusty, and also give some hope to my fellow ladies that it is possible to find a bra that really changes your life and helps you to feel better about yourself.

Even my good friend, who works at a Vet clinic, mentioned my size to some of the women there who had seen me at their Christmas party. 


Needless to say, it always blows minds and piques interest. So this last week, I received my first request from my hair stylist for the bra sizing guide I used. My mom has been in the hospital, so it all got put on the back burner, but I received THREE MORE yesterday from the women at the Vet clinic. 

So last night, I threw together what I'm calling a ""boob care package."" Included is the MWB's guide, a couple introductory notes I had about sizing and fitting, [a visual guide about putting on a bra properly from a blog](http://brasandbodyimage.wordpress.com/2012/09/05/putting-your-bra-on-properly/), the [Breakout Bras fitting guide](http://www.breakoutbras.com/sizing), and finally a collage of properly fitted DD busts.

[Here it is](http://i.imgur.com/4q5uo.jpg).

I also included many stories told here on this subreddit from women who are now in the correct size, as well as the sister sizing chart, the wire width guide, as well as many pictures of my own and some from various bloggers (which I credited) such as Thin and Curvy's fantastic [set of photos](http://www.thinandcurvy.com/2011/05/where-to-find-26-and-24-band-bras-and.html). Don't worry, I explained them all, too!

I also wrote a bit of an ""introduction,"" if you will, based on a rant I posted here at /r/abrathatfits awhile back. If you're interested, here it is (if not, feel free to skip this portion):

---

**INTRODUCTION**

In the United States, we treat bra sizes like shoe sizes, so naturally we think of bra sizes the wrong way. We completely disregard band sizes and only think of cup sizes (A, B, C, D, et cetra) as representative of breast size. A is small, B is slightly larger, C about average, D fairly busty, and DD very busty, right? I mean, what else are we expected to think when we hear that stars like Angelina Jolie is a â36Câ and Christina Hendricks is a â38DD.â Worse, a majority of fitters donât even measure women correctly. 

Many women Iâve talked to are fitted at Victoriaâs Secret. Itâs accessible, easy, and after all, they have adorable bras! Unfortunately, Victoriaâs Secret uses the +4 method (adding 4â to  your band size â this is the 32, 34, 36 [and so on] number). This method is great if youâre creating antiquated bras with no stretch, but it doesnât work for modern bras which are made out of lovely, modern fabrics and elastics. This means that a bra for a 32â underbust might measure 25â unstretched, but will easily stretch to compensate. This ensures the band is snug and supportive.

So if this is the case, why do manufacturers continue to follow this rule? Due to the amount of sizes available as well as band sizes, I believe many manufacturers simply find it easier and cheaper to provide a smaller range of sizes. In Victoriaâs Secretâs case, that is a 32-38 AA-DD. If my math is correct, thatâs only 24 sizes. Unfortunately, this means an ill-fitted bra for a majority of women, since that is only a fraction of the range of bra sizes. As a result, many women experience bands that ride up, strapless bras that constantly fall down, gores that donât tack (the central portion of the bra between your breasts), cups that are way too small, and back/neck pain that is nearly always met with âWell, get a reduction!â

In short, the business model of Victoriaâs Secret and bra shops like them has created a culture that holds the idea that breasts are to blame because those are the only sizes. So if youâre overflowing from cups or falling out of your plunge bras constantly, your âlargeâ breasts are to blame. And back pain? Must be abnormally large breasts, not the bra!

In turn, this has created a bit of a psychological sizing dilemma. Many times when Iâve seen other women in correctly sized bras try to help a friend of family member who struggles with the ill effects of a bad bra, they are met with disbelief and even anger. Since we treat the bra model and sizing chart as more of a vertical scale (need a bigger bra? Go up to a 36C from a 34C!), we are flabbergasted when more letters are introduced and suddenly weâre sliding diagonally â from a 34C to a 28FF or even a 32A to a 30D. After all, in a culture that has been (unfortunately) led to believe our breasts are to blame and âD breastsâ are large while âDD breastsâ are even larger, it seems ridiculous to think that your petite A cups are closer to the Christina Hendricks DD cup. And even though Miss Hendricks is certainly not a DD, you can see how this visualization and incorrect information perpetuated by our ignorance of proper bra sizing and fitting is a shock to many people.

I hand delivered the guides today. They were all very happily received, and frankly, I can't wait to see more women's lives changed for the better. 

So to conclude this (already enormous) post, I'd like to ask people here: What information did you find most helpful when beginning your search for a correct bra? Since most of the women I've passed this onto (and any in the future) aren't Redditors, I'll need to put most of it down in pictures or something written. 


Edit: Wow, I've gotten such an amazing response to this thread. Thank you everyone! I also received ANOTHER request today for the guide -- friend of mine wants to give it to his step-mother, who he is convinced is in a very badly fitting bra. I will be making lots of helpful edits and including even more awesome links.

Somehow everyone that submitted their photos had narrow roots, so I made the post about that. I'd love to do another one on broad roots. Would some of you broad-root women be interested in sending in photos? I'd be really really grateful.

I'd like to request you to contribute photos of broad-root breasts in a bra with narrow underwires and also a bra with broad underwires. This would help women to recognize the symptoms of bad underwire fit.
And also your measurements, the size and name of the bra that you are wearing, as well as any comments about your breast shape that you might have. An additional photo of the breasts without a bra is great too (helps women compare and determine their own breast shape), but of course you don't have to send one if you don't want to.

Thank you!!,infinitetbr,91,6,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/19qd4y/ladies_i_havent_touched_my_bra_all_day_not_once/,"I bought some bras off of Ebay in 32E - they didn't fit, not a one of them. I was so sad. Honestly, I thought ""Hmph! This ""new"" way to measure is a hoax, fake, scam"". Some ladies were nice enough to point out though that the shape was all wrong for me. So I read **more** articles and said, ok.. I'm shallow chested, I'm full on the bottom, and my breasts are conical. Armed with the new information (but still HIGHLY skeptical), my boyfriend dragged me out to bra shop in person. 

We went in every store in the mall that sold bras. TWO stores even had sizes as big as I needed (32DDD -US). Victoria Secret and Macy's. Victoria Secret made me feel crappy - I don't know about other people but the store made me uncomfortable. From the way they write your name on your door tag, to the way they push to measure you, etc.

Anyway - none of their bras fit. Off to Macy's! The ladies there were AWESOME! They were dubious as to my wearing a 32DDD or even a 32DD - but they grabbed the bras for me just the same. I left with a bra that seemed to fit!

We headed over to the specialty shop near the mall and the ladies there were nodding and seemed happy to hear me using terms like ""shallow chest"", etc. I found two bras there as well.

After I posted a fit check, you nice ladies said to go with the Macy's bra. I ordered another bra off of Ebay based off the fit of that bra.

I wore my new bra to work today. Ladies, I haven't touched it once. Not to adjust a strap, not to wiggle the band, nothing. I can't tell you the number of times a day I was pulling on the band, flipping up a fallen strap, etc before.

I've been finding it so hard to find good bras my size, and shopping online is okay but I much prefer trying them on in store. 

My nearest Bravissimio is two hours away by train and there are no lingerie shops in my area or surrounding counties to cater for bigger busted ladies. I figure that there's a gap in the market that I could fill. I'm going to starting up seminars over this week and have looked at the government guides to starting up a business.

I think what I'm looking for is some emotional support! I'm nervous and though I've done quite a bit of research I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed. What would you ladies be looking for in a bra shop? I'd probably be looking to cater for something like 28D to 40J/L but I'm not sure how probable that is! I'm feeling a little lost and scared as I've never thought about anything like this before.

What I do know is that I'm getting a bit tired of ordering bras online, only to send them back almost immediately. Also, the superstore own brand are just not good enough and don't cater for enough shapes and sizes, I want everyone to have a well fitting bra and not feel bad about what size they are after an ill-informed fitting. Our breasts are a big part of our lives and we spend a lot of money on them. I want people to be able to walk about of a fitting room feeling happy and normal, and to walk out of a shop with at least one well-fitting and pretty bra. I want to make people feel confident in their bodies and confident in bras that fit. 

EDIT: Made a [survey](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/WSH6BMK), I'd be really happy if as many people as possible could take it.

Well, guess which one fit best? :P I asked the fitter to come and check, she agreed it was pretty much a perfect fit. She said in most brands I would probably be a 32D, but that particular bra, Calvin Klein Seductive Comfort, runs small.

The Bra Band Project originally started as an awareness project to alert companies about the need for 30-and-under band bras - basically, to prove that yes, women who need under-32 bands DO exist. Over 150 women submitted pictures, and since its creation, the BBP has become a useful resource/reference to show what a 28DD/30J/26F/etc really looks like. And that's pretty awesome!


We feel, however (and I believe it's been expressed here, as well) that it would be useful to have examples of women wearing a range of *all* sizes, not just under-32 bands. So, we've decided to create a sister project, if you will: the **Perfectly Fitted Bra Project**. 

Basically, we're looking to provide a reference for people to see what other sizes can look like when correctly fitted! Properly-fitted ""commonly sold"" between 32-38 A-DD are especially helpful, but we're looking for examples for EVERY size. We'll organize and create another album from the submissions, just like the Bra Band Project.



Want to get involved? (hooray!) It's easy! Just email the following to **perfectlyfitted[at]gmail.com** or **brabandproject[at]gmail.com**

* **A picture of yourself** - either full-body or at least waist-up (a picture of just your chest area isn't the most helpful) in either a bra or clothing (no nudity, please!). A fit-request sort of picture is perfect - a regular ol' picture of yourself is great, too. We'll crop out faces if needed - submissions will be kept completely anonymous.

* **Your usual bra size** (please only submit if you know and are wearing your [correct bra size](http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/rh26h/is_getting_fitted_for_a_bra_as_humiliating_as_it/c469bi0) - altered bras are fine)

Optional:

**Your age** (note that **you must be at least 18** to participate)

You can include your underbust/bust measurement if you like



Again, note that we'd love submissions from every size! If you're under a 32 band, feel free to submit as well; your picture will be added to the original 30-and-under Bra Band Project.

Comments or questions? We'd love to hear them! :)

I have become so completely obsessed with bra fitting, I can't stop learning about every little aspect of perfect fit, I find it fascinating.
so..it is so true that us girls at VS are NOT trained properly AT ALL. 
I'm the only girl at my store that takes band measurements under the bust and it really disturbs me. No one can tell when a band is too big and I think that's really the most common fit problem that happens at VS.
I want to educate women on how a bra should fit, even if we don't have their size (and believe me...I tell them even if it means losing a big sale)

anyway. Our bra specialist position just opened up and I have wanted it forever. 
I'm constantly put on the register because I'm really good at selling credit cards, while this other girl who has no idea what she's doing keeps getting put in the fitting room to do fittings temporarily while the bra specialist position is up in the air.
mostly because she puts on this obnoxiously fake customer service persona that apparently is great for business. *gag*
I can tell she's first in line for the job and its infuriating.

I have so much passion for bra fitting...but I get so annoyed by VS as a company sometimes because we have such limited sizes. (nothing smaller than a 32 band) (nothing bigger than DDD cups) and also that they don't make it a priority to teach their staff to be competent bra fitters.

I'll interview for the position sometime this week and will pour my heart out... If I don't get the position, I'd almost consider quitting.
what would ya'll do in my situation? 
I ask to be zoned in the fitting room all the time...they never listen and if this other girl is working there the same time as me....she of course is put in the fitting rooms and i'm stuck on the register.

1370847102.0,83,self.ABraThatFits,1g15p3,PSA/Observation relevant to folks who leave up their fit check albums for posterity,ButTheBoobies,101,18,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/1g15p3/psaobservation_relevant_to_folks_who_leave_up/,"I noticed the hit counter data for the first time on my imgur account today, and noticed that my [recent post about Target bikinis](http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/1fyfi6/a_few_of_you_recommended_i_try_targets_bikini/) had received over 5000 views in under 24 hours. 

Out of curiosity I compared this to the number of views on my other imgur albums, and found that that is far above typical. Most of my fit check albums have around 1k views, while a few that I put together to demonstrate fit or similar in comments have fewer than 300. Considering our subscriber base, these numbers make much better sense.

I did notice two other albums that had a sizeable number of views. The first - over 3000 views - was the photos for a [PSA I posted about ill fitting wires](http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/1b5jzi/the_perils_of_wearing_tootall_wires_psa_nsfw/) which contained shots of my bare breasts. Another still - [my first bikini fit check](http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/1esg3p/in_case_any_other_34jish_ladies_out_there_thought/) - has **over 7000**.

It's understandable that people check out our fit albums for reasons other than... well, what we intend them for: education, illustration, requests for assistance. It's understandable that some albums have more value in the context of those alternative motives than others. While I was surprised at just *how big* those view counts were on my albums, I certainly can't say I was surprised to see higher viewership than what traffic on this sub would warrant.

That being said, I also did some digging and found that my albums were being cross posted to subs like /r/burstingout. Again, not something that is surprising to me, but something I hadn't really considered before. Sure, I expected the photos to be seen. Sure, I expect the posts where the photos were linked to be seen - even by people for whom they weren't explicitly intended (our community here on ABTF). But I hadn't really ever thought about someone taking those URLs and posting them elsewhere outside of this context for an entirely different community to consume.

I'm not a shy lady, and I'm working on a body positive attitude all the time. I firmly believe that my fit checks help women, and I am determined to keep my photo albums live despite the superfluous and unwanted attention that the photos seem to have drawn beyond our sub. I'm not ashamed of my body, I'm not really a private person in general, so there's not a lot of reason for me to take away learning resources that might benefit someone else, even if that comes at the cost of becoming part of someone's spank bank or a target of anonymous ridicule.

Many of you, however, I realize are not like me. Many of you would be really creeped out that nearly eight thousand people had seen your boobs and that you could probably get [doxed](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/doxing) from your comments, jewelry, and the backgrounds of your photos. Many of you would not be comfortable having your breasts sexualized out of your control, without your consent, and when our objective here is to approach breasts with a nonsexual and quite pragmatic philosophy: bras that fit for comfort and support and confidence. Many of you would not be able to brush yourself off from being judged and scrutinized by thousands of prying eyes who do not have as positive intentions or supportive attitudes as our sub's core viewership.

If you are in that category of those who cannot shrug away those numbers, and the extrapolations that easily follow from them, then please *please* be careful. Please guard your personal data as best you can and please be mindful about deleting your albums when they've served their purpose. I know firsthand how frustrating it can be to come across a fit check that describes exactly a problem you're having, only to find that the photos are missing; but that is a small price to pay for your safety and peace of mind.

Please put down the size that you *wear*, not necessarily the one that you measure.  

**A note on the accuracy of the survey**, it will not be perfect. There is human error, both in the responses and recording the responses. A few lines have had to be omitted (such as line 336 with 6 cup measurements and 6 band sizes). I tally the responses *by hand* in a notebook to make the final result chart.  

What statistics would you like to see pulled from the results? I plan on doing the most common band size, most common cup size, most common size, and most common cup volume. EDIT: also going to calculate the percentage of users in the ""common"" size range(32-38 AA-DD)

Everyone knows what well fitting jeans should look like.

If a woman is going around in size 20 pants when she should be wearing an 8 everyone will know that her pants don't fit. She'll figure out pretty quickly that she needs a smaller size, and it won't bother her at all. Almost nobody would make this big of a mistake with pants sizing. There are no magazines saying ""The average woman is a size 20. Look at this supermodel who is a size 8! She's a freak of nature!"" If magazines did that then we would have a lot of women in size 20 skinny jeans wondering why their pants keep falling down and worrying that they have a weird shaped body because their jeans don't fit right. If you told those women they should wear a size 8 they would laugh because they think that only models can wear that size. (That's an exaggeration.)

Now imagine you have a woman in a 40C who should be wearing a 34F. She keeps wondering why her bra digs into her shoulders, but she figures that's how it's supposed to be. If someone tells her that she should be a 34 band she will tell them that it will be way too tight. If someone tells her that she should be an F cup she will be shocked because the media tells her that a DD is pornstar sized boobs.

The dress requires a strapless bra, and I threw out my old strapless months ago because it was just too old and worn out. So I go to the store today to buy a new one. I wear a size 32F, but, understandably, that size is not regularly available in most bra stores. So what I usually do is compromise and go for a 34DD. Yes, the band's a bit loose, but it's kind of whatever. I just hook it on the smallest loop and it's usually OK. But today, I remembered why I had the same strapless for so long. Because bra companies simply do not make ""specialty"" bras in a wide range of sizes.

The closest thing I could find to my size was a 36D. The band was way too big, which made my boobs sag (as it is strapless) and somehow there was STILL extra boobage hanging out when I put down my arms. I see all these magazines and ads telling me that big boobs and a small waist is desirable, but if it's so desirable, why can't I find any bras to fit that figure? I rarely see bras above a D unless the band is 38 or higher. Do they think all thin women have tiny boobs? The inverse applies too. I never see bras for 38+ band sizes under a C, maybe. And I'm not saying I have the ideal boobs. They have stretch marks and sag, because that's how NATURAL big boobs behave. Gravity actually has an effect on them. And it's fine if you want a get a boob job to have big, perky boobs so they look good braless. But I don't want one. And I can't find a bra in my size, so I'm assuming that means the stores want me to go braless? But I don't think that's what they really want, because if I went braless someone's eye would get taken out.

I can't find a bra in my size, but it's socially unacceptable to go around braless at my size. Every single time I've gone bra shopping since my boobs were above a C (so, like, since 8th grade) I've cried in the dressing room because shopping for a bra is SO STRESSFUL. If you're small, you need a pushup bra. If you're big, you need a breast reduction. You can't order online because how would you be sure the bra fits. The only size you can consistently find across most band sizes is a C. Is the universe trying to tell me that I need to be a C? Because seriously, this is frustrating. I get cat calls and whistles if I wear anything tighter than a loose t-shirt, but I can't even find a normal bra? Why is there so much sexualization of a size that rarely even exists naturally, but when it does exist naturally, it's ""gross"" because natural big boobs are actually affected by gravity when they aren't restrained by a bra? And why is my body inherently sexual even if I'm not trying to make it that way, just because that's the way I'm naturally shaped? All through middle school and junior high I wore oversized tee shirts almost exclusively because I was so ashamed of my body and girls would tell me to ""get a breast reduction"" when I didn't need one because there's nothing wrong with my back. I literally got called ""tits"" by a guy once in high school. And I'm over that by now because I'm older and don't really care what people think of me anymore, but seriously, is it asking too much to just have a bra in a store that I can buy?",,False,,t5_2s8kf,False,,,True,t3_1fvgjb,http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/1fvgjb/rant_about_buying_bras/,

I made a bra, kind of.",embean,96,19,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/1f2tyg/update_this_is_happening_i_made_a_bra_kind_of/,"Here is my update to [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/1f186h/this_is_happening/) from yesterday.

It's obvious in that thread that I kind of had problems. In the end I stopped following instructions and did what seemed logical to me (like ""okay, sewing in elastic now!"")

My final verdict is that once I got the hang of sewing a ""garment,"" it's not THAT difficult. If I were to do this again, I think it would be much easier. 

[Here are some pics of the ""finished"" bra](http://imgur.com/a/AbEWn). My main issue with this bra is that it's quite ""matronly"" looking, it almost looks like a nursing bra. I think that's because the band and the straps stayed so thick. I checked the pattern and the only step that reduces size/width is sewing in the elastic, which I did. Maybe this is just the cut of the bra? [It's this pattern.](http://www.bramakerssupply.com/site2009/cart/shopdisplayproducts.asp?id=7&amp;cat=Full+Band)

Also, there was no step included to finish the edges of the band. The hooks are too small to encase the ends of the band, and so I've just kind of tacked them on. There was no step in the pattern to taper down the ends or anything. I would think that for a bigger size, the pieces would be proportionally bigger so this would be even more difficult? Considering the hooks only come in one size.

(pics removed, PM me for these) I'm kind of surprised how well it fits. The cups pretty much... fit, which I was not expecting in a 2-part cup. The wires are too narrow and the band is too big, but these are issues I usually expect in an off-the-rack bra too. I considered buying wider wires than the pattern called for because I anticipated I would need them, but the thing is.. the wires are as long as the wire channels, which are as wide as the cups. If I wanted wider wires I'd have to make fairly major modifications. As it is, the wires take up the whole channel and I think there's supposed to be a bit of room. It's pretty comfortable, considering the wires are too narrow. Also, my scoop &amp; swoop doesn't really stay in this. I probably won't wear this as part of my normal rotation or anything. 

If anyone is interested, I made this bra with the above pattern and the [single bra kit](http://www.bramakerssupply.com/site2009/cart/shopdisplayproducts.asp?id=3&amp;cat=Kits+and+Bundles) from that website. There are cheaper places to buy things, but that retailer is in Canada and shipping was really fast. There was also a problem with my order that they rectified pretty quickly. 

Here's some links that helped me during the process:

This means she's getting boobs.. I haven't even found the magical right bra for me, how am I going to deal with shopping for my daughter?! And for what it's worth, my 5 year old daughter doesn't have this at all yet.

I guess on the bright side, she can probably get away with the pull over bralette things for a while.. I started developing at her age as well, but didn't actually need bras until I was about 9.

The inside of the store was big, clean, and well lit, and they had two staff in a nearly empty store. The store does not have bras hanging free on the racks, but instead had one table as a demo displaying their sizing system, and the other displaying their five? different styles of bras if I remember correctly. Two were underwired padded, one was underwired unpadded, one was wireless padded, and the other was wireless unpadded. 

One of their fitters immediately came up to me and started explaining the concept of their fitting system to me. I agreed to try it out and was sent into the fitting room. 

The fitting rooms have a TV, a table with the measuring cups, and a padded bench. When you want the workers to come in you can ring a buzzer by the door. 

There was a robe hanging to put on, so I did. The fitter came back in and asked me what bra size I usually am. She seemed very surprised but grabbed the size 7 cup to try on with me and was surprised that it sort-of fit (personally I think the size 8 came closer to actually covering all my breast tissue.) She said that she herself was a ""G cup"", but looking at her I'd roughly eyeball her as a 34HH or so. Her bra didn't seem to fit, from what little I could tell from her shirt. 

Then she measured my band over the robe I was wearing, and declared it a 36. I told her that 36s usually ride up on me, but she both told me that their bras are different and that she had a trick to get bands to stay put. I figure I'll let her bring a 36 to see what she thinks of the fit. 

The moulded cups are not at all my breast shape, and the underwire on the 7 was narrower than I generally wear. The underwire is bent and super thick (like a popsicle stick on your skin sideways) at the end theoretically to hold your breast tissue in, but because I don't have the narrow projecting boobs it's cut for, this didn't work. I could pull the bra away from my body by the center gore several inches, and could not even get my armpit boob into the cups. 

The fitter was reluctant to get me a smaller band as she (repeatedly whenever I asked for a smaller size) said that it causes back fat, and makes the bra uncomfortable if it's ""too tight."" 

Eventually we worked down to a 34. She tried adjusting the (far too wide set on me) shoulder straps by tightening them in place. When I pointed out that this was causing the straps to fold at the base in to not fall off my shoulders, she told me that this is because the band is tighter and that the looser band was better for this. Oh, and the secret to not causing the band to ride up? She pulled it way down my back into a U shape. When I explained that I thought doing this usually means the band is too big on me, she said that for women with my shape (I can only assume that she means ladies on the bigger side of non-plus sizes, as I'm currently a 12-14) this works and prevents ""back fat."" 

She told me I should give the non-wired bra a try, as her customers with wide breasts have had good experiences with it. Sure, I'll give it a go. I try it on in both a 7-34, 6-34 and a 7-32. In both cases the band is too big, and the cups fold over and droop with my boobs in them. They look dismal. She tells me to put on my shirt and try them on then, because she's had customers who have thought the nonwired bra looked bad on until they put a shirt on. It didn't just look a bit funny, it was hanging onto my breasts like a sling. 

I also retry the moulded bra in a 7-32 and the underwired nonmoulded bra in a 7-32. In both cases the band is too big and the cups are not of the right proportion, seemingly all being cut for the same breast shape. She is extremely reluctant to try a 30 band with me and it never happens. 

I will note that throughout the process she was extremely nice and did not pressure me to buy. She explained that the bras are ""supposed to fit"" 75% of women but they wont pressure women to buying one if they don't fit. With better training she definitely had the personality to be a good fitter, but that does not seem like it happened. 

One thing I noted throughout trying on all of these bras is that they really do not appear to be worth $60 in quality. In the moulded bras, the mould would often pop up over the underwire while you were putting on the bra. In the unmoulded bra, the seams were flipping in and out. The bands were super stretchy. The padding in the cups at least at my size folded easily. None of the cups had seams on them. I'd say that they were pretty comparable to bras you can pick up for $15-$30 from walmart, sears, etc. 

Unfortunately, while I went in thinking that their sizing was a bit gimmicky but at least I might find another bra store that actually carries bras that fit me, this was not the case. While they carry roughly around the volume I need, the shape was off, and there was really only one shape available. Combined with staff that don't seem to be very well trained, very stretchy bands, and bras that don't seem to be of the quality they cost, I wasn't impressed. Had they offered what I assume my actual size in their system would be (an 8-30 or so) in more shapes and better quality, I'd have been much more impressed. 

Then I went off to H&amp;M to check out the larger cup sizes they're supposedly stocking now. Only one model had above a D cup in stock, a pink lace moulded full-cup bra that they had in 36 and 38 E and F (the F, I think, is a UK E.) I asked and they said they don't stock it smaller than a 36 band (at least at that store.) The bra was very cute and was of pretty good construction for a $17 bra, even though it wasn't my size.

I've already had messages from people saying they have never been more comfortable, and one person even said I made her every day life better because her back pain has been significantly reduced. All this gives me the super fuzzy feels inside, but I also owe it to you guys.

This post is kind of a 'yay lets celebrate the knowledge that is spreading!', as well as a thank you to all of you guys for imbuing me with the knowledge, making me capable of spreading it around. Its also kind of a 'if you have a tumblr, pls reblog so it can spread faster' kind of deal.

When she first started getting breasts, she hated them. She wore the tightest sports bras she could find 24 hours a day. When she got to the age where she wanted to have boobs, her breast tissue had been smooshed around to her back. My mother and I discussed it a few days ago, and we figured out that she has some great big tits hiding under her clothes.

So I measured her last night: 38"" under, 48"" over.

I had a 38H with me, and I had her try it on. It looked gargantuan. Then I taught her to swoop and scoop, and wouldn't you know it, she fills all but the top inch of the cups.

I'm going to try her in some 38FFs and 38Gs. She was wearing a 38D from VS last night, which just sort of sat on top of her boobs and gave her back rolls.

She's rather excited about not being the token flat girl in a family of large-breasted women.

It was neat to see the instant change in her posture, as well. Her waist looked well-defined, her tummy looked slimmer, her back was smooth, and (unlike Mom and I) she has the backside and hips to balance her breasts to give her a fantastic hourglass shape.

I predict she will be converting a ton of her friends to proper bra sizing; she's just that sort of woman.

We carefully design and engineer bras that offer the greatest comfort, style, and support to our customers. Each new design is carefully researched to ensure the sizing and fit is comfortable. Currently, we do not manufacture all bras in every size, as they will not be supportive or comfortable in the fuller cup size. We frequently review our assortment as well as our customer demand and feedback to make adjustments to our sizes and styles offered in stores.

&gt;    I assure you I have personally forwarded your specific comments to our merchandise department. I want to let you know that we appreciate your comments and take them seriously. In fact, customer suggestions and comments often provide direction for changes in future merchandise and services. I truly thank you for your sharing your feedback.

Someone should start a bra company that has consultants who come to your house and measure you and sell bras. It would be like Mary Kay or Slumber Parties, but with bras! When the people sign up to be consultants I'll send them information about the bras we sell and how to size people. Before they can start selling they'll have to take a quiz where they're given measurements and they have to estimate a size. (Of course there will be a few sizes that are ok for each set. As long as someone with a 29 inch ribcage is getting a 28 or 30 band it's ok. No 34B's for tiny ladies!)

They could have magazine type things with pictures of models who wear different sizes so people can see what a real 30H looks like, since there will probably be a ton of people who don't believe it.

They could also take a bunch of bras with them for people to try on. That would be kind of a hard part because there are soooo many sizes. I was thinking that they could just take a ton of sizes and have the style alternate for each one (So a 28C balconette, 28D plunge, 28DD full coverage, 28F t-shirt bra, then start over at 28FF.) If they had enough space to carry them it would be better if they could take 1 or 2 kinds of bra in every size and then just take a few rando sizes of other ones. That way people can try on something that is their actual size, but they would be able to get really close if they didn't like the style.

The company would try to make the sizing as regular as possible between styles. We would probably only make a few basic types of bras, but we would have tons of different colors and embellishments. We would probably sell bra extenders/shorteners and padding and other random bra-related objects as well.

What do you ladies think? Would you go to a bra-party? For the ladies who don't like ordering online because you want to try stuff on, would you order bras from a company like this?

While I understand the desire to have a bra that's good for your shape as well as your size, most of these posts don't have enough information in them.

It's really hard to tell just by looking, especially when there's no bra as a reference point.  It's far easier to describe problems you have with bras that would otherwise fit, and maybe a picture in a bra for reference.  While I'm okay with naked boobies, and I don't mind helping someone find their shape at all, you guys need to meet us halfway here.  Even experienced bra fitting bloggers like June from Braless in Brasil admit that they cannot tell what shape someone's naked breast is simply by looking.  Sometimes it's really obvious, but most of the time it's not because most people do not have an extreme breast shape (like extreme full on bottom, extreme narrowness etc...).  A lot of breast characteristics cannot be gauged by just looking at a picture over the internet.

So I propose that at the bare minimum, if you want to know your shape, you do the following:

**Describe common fit issues you have with bras that would otherwise be well fitting.  Make sure to name specific brands, models, and sizes when describing your fit issues.**

**If you feel comfortable, take pictures of your breasts in said bras in a well lit area.  Include a front view, side view, 45 degree angle view, back view, whatever areas you feel are problematic with the fit of your bra.**

**Include your measurements, at the very minimum your underbust and your bust.  For a more detailed response, include the /u/t_maia measurements: underbust snugly, underbust extremely tight (like trying to break the tape measure), bust leaning over, bust standing, and bust on your back.**

I want to be able to help, so it would be good to have enough information right off the bat.  Pictures are not even necessarily the best way to gauge shape.

EDIT: So, what if we created a review thread, similar to /u/a3lt's thread, starting with /u/t_maia's list of brands. Each brand could have its own comment, and we can all add our on reviews for that brand's models as sub-comments? I think it would gain more traction if it were a sidebar link.

She always talks about how bras are uncomfortable for her and etc. but she REFUSED to believe she needed a bigger cup size. This is also super difficult because she was a professional seamstress.

I knew she did, she was spilling out everywhere and the band was riding up practically to her neck.

After weeks of trying I finally convinced her to let me measure her. I just had to basically tell her that it was happening and I was doing it. I had to explain to her why her bra didn't fit and she eventually agreed when I showed her on me how a bra is SUPPOSED to fit.

She was wearing a 38C. I measured her and it came out to a 34F. 

She was flabbergasted! She thought it was impossible, that I did it wrong and she laughed at me.

I told her we could go to Nordstrom and see and if she didn't like it, she didn't have to get any new ones.

Well, we took her to Nordstrom and the lady asked me if she could help. I told her we were looking for 34F and 34FF. She eyed my breasts suspiciously and asked if that was for me. I laughed and told her they were for Grandma.

She of course, asked if she had been fitted there and I told her that I did that myself. She asked if we would mind if she measured again.

Well she did the underbust and then put her tape measure away, telling me I did a perfect job. She then brought us some 34F bras and helped my grandma into them. At first, Grandma laughed because the cups looked huge to her. But of course she was stunned when they fit perfectly.

The lady (super, super nice) told me I should get a job at Nordstrom since I had done such an excellent job. Grandma was so happy that the bras weren't uncomfortable and of course, we left without buying anything. 

Today I introduce her to the magical land of Bra Stop!
Victory!

Thanks /r/ABraThatFits. You helped both of us out so much! Without y'all I'd still be wearing a 38F and my tiny 36G.

A separate post will eventually be made once the final decision is made.**

I'm going to be very candid here and blunt, just throwing that out there.

Several things:

**Flair:**You may notice that some of us now have flair. I want to ensure the community this is something that was heavily discussed and ultimately agreed upon to implement. There have been legitimate concerns about quality of posts and advice given to newcomers from those who are not as well versed in bra fitting and are unintentionally giving the OP bad advice. I'm NOT going to give examples or call anyone out, but I will say this: **If you are new here and are unsure of the advice you're giving, please post a disclaimer. If someone comes in and contradicts your advice and they know what they are talking about, do not cop an attitude.** Be graceful about the correction; it's not an opportunity to belittle and insult your intellect, but it's an opportunity to teach and inform so you can learn more about the nuances of bra fitting. I'm a mod, and I've been here for quite a while and I've learned a lot, but I do not know all, nor do I claim to. If I'm unsure of the advice I give; I always post a disclaimer to take it with a grain of salt and I of course ALWAYS apologize for giving incorrect information when someone comes in and let me know I have done so, and I have edited posts to remove the misinformation. I would have liked the flair to wait until an announcement was made, but it is what it is. This isn't something that's trying to exclude anyone or inclusive to a 'special club'; it's the hopes that if someone comes in asking for advice and they seem to get conflicting information, that it'll hopefully be a bit more obvious on what advice they should probably follow. 

It's upsetting for someone to come in, ask for advice, get conflicting information, they inadvertently take the wrong advice and order the wrong bras.. get the wrong bras and get frustrated when it doesn't work the first time around, then just go ""These women have no clue what they are talking about!"" and give up on trying to find a bra that fits and goes back to their ill fitting bras and never come back. Bra fitting is a science with a little bit of geometry added in. You may be able to get it right the first time, but this is also very unlikely. It's unfortunately not realistic to toss up measurements, get recommendations and then order bras and then have the heavenly choir come down with a beam of light and start singing a heavenly choir at you. Figuratively speaking anyway. Even now, 8 months after finding this subreddit and immersing myself in here.. I still have not found my perfect bras.. the ones I have right now are as good as it's going to get for the time being.

**Memes:** It was never official nor added to the sidebar -and I fully intend to change this sometime this weekend- but let's restrict posting funny pictures and memes to Monday. I have also suggested we make a catch all ""MEME MONDAY"" thread on Mondays and very similar to the weekly discussions, people can add to it during the week. That way, those ladies who do not wish to see these things can skip out of looking at the thread, and those who enjoy having a chuckle or giggle during the week can go ahead and pop in and look at the memes and pictures and whatever. The focus of this subreddit is to help ladies to get into better fitting bras, but yeah we need some fun injected every once in a while. I think we may be able to start implementing this starting next Monday, unless there's any objection. If we see stuff crop up, we can just direct folks to posting in the weekly thread. **Let's do this in a friendly and kind tone, ya'll.**

And one more thing that I feel is extremely important: **When someone new comes in and posts for measurement check or sizing help, DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES ask them to share pictures of them in their ill fitting bras. This IS COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY.** Those of us who have more knowledge are able to offer recommendations without pictures; hence one of the reasons why we've implemented flair. PLUS, you do not always know the age of the poster -and it's completely not even needed to know how old they are- and we do not need to inadvertently encourage underage girls to post pictures of themselves in bras. We get a lot of creeps in here and I'd like to keep this a safe environment.

Oh and on the flair bit.. we will be including more ladies in the ranks of having fitting expertise flair, but for now we'll leave it as it is.. we need to come up with some kind of criteria on how to determine who gets it and what it will say. Some of us are more knowledgeable about certain fitting situations, and we'd like to have the flair reflect our individual areas of knowledge.",,False,,t5_2s8kf,1374443888.0,,braexpert,True,t3_1ipge7,http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/1ipge7/mod_post_a_heads_up/,moderator
1373560732.0,70,self.ABraThatFits,1i37yo,[Mod Post] PSA about taking measurements!,wambrita,82,12,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/1i37yo/mod_post_psa_about_taking_measurements/,"Hi all! I want to start by saying hello to all the new comers, and I'm glad that people are reading the guide and coming in and asking for help to muddle through their new found measurements. And of course I want to say thank you to those that are offering help and suggestions!

However, I do want to mention a trend that I've noticed; not just with the newcomers but also something I've done wrong as well.

So, the visual guide asks to take three bust measurements.. standing up, leaning over and laying down. The standing up and leaning over measurements are pretty easy to do themselves; however the laying down measurement is tricky to get. I discovered about a month ago that I had been doing my laying down measurement incorrectly! I had been just going off of feel and a rough ballpark with the tape placement and my laying down measurement was 36.5"", while my standing up measurement was 36.25"". My breasts are far from being firm, so that didn't make sense. On a whim, I decided to check the tape placement by using the forward facing camera on my phone (I don't own a hand mirror large enough to see the entirety of my breasts) and discovered where I was placing the tape was about an inch or so lower than where the widest parts of my breasts at, and then pulling it up and around the widest part of my breasts. I quickly scooted around and wiggled until the tape was coming straight up around the widest parts of my breast, and then discovered that my laying down measurement was not 36.5"" like I thought, but it was 35""!!

I have started asking random new users to double check their laying down measurements to make sure the tape was placed correctly. In one case, the user was off by about 2""-4"". As you can imagine, this can certainly change the results and ultimately the recommended bra size range to try. 

Of course, this may not always be the case; especially if the user has firm breasts, in which case, their laying measurement can be equal or slightly larger than their standing measurement or close to their leaning over measurement. So, with that being said, if you see someone who's leaning and laying measurements are close, please take breast firmness into consideration; perhaps ask to confirm if they have firm breasts or not, rather than assume they did it wrong. ^I ^recently ^did ^this, ^woops... I do not know if women with shallow breasts will get a similar result to a woman with firm breasts or not. *(If you are a confirmed shallow shape and could do this for me, I would greatly appreciate it! Take your laying down bust measurement without the aid of a mirror or spotter and then again with the aid.)*

I have added the following tip to the visual fitting guide in italics; **""Please make sure that when taking the laying down measurement that you are pulling the tape straight up around the widest part of your bust with the help of a mirror or a spotter. It is difficult to do this without a side view, and if the tape is being pulled up at an angle, this will add inches/cms to the laying down measurement and can throw off size suggestions.""**

My fitter at Linda's (since I'm not happy I won't mention her name out of decency) brings in the bras and slightly pulled me into the bra.

This trend of too big band too small cup continues through the rest of the fitting and she keeps shoving me back into the cup every time I swoop. 

Finally she brings me the Parfait Jeanie in a 34DD (UGH) but I like the general fit and pointed out I didn't feel secure. She checks it and the band stretched a good 6+ inches from my back. I ask her for the 32E. She says they don't carry it. WHAT?! This happened to another bra she brought me. Finally I asked her how many 32 band styles in my cup size and she tells me 'a couple'.

**When dealing with anyone**

* Be polite

* Be respectful

* If they're comfortable enough to give measurements, trust them enough to handle a tape measure. Do not discount the measurements because ""they're too small"" or ""too large""; saying as much is incredibly rude! Be respectful and happy that this is a place where people are comfortable sharing their measurements, pictures, problems, etc. 

* Remember that the end goal is to help and not leave someone feeling offended, violated, etc

**When dealing with internet strangers**

* Consider if the advice is in appropriate context; such as someone asking for advice in female fashion advice or someone asking about breast reductions in bigboobproblems problems when a good bra may save them the surgery, etc. Please do not give un-solicited advice. Most will find it rude.
* Show genuine kindness/concern/a desire to help
* Be polite (say please, thank you, apologize if you offend them, clarify if something is taken out of context, etc)
* Try to help them realize that there could be a better bra (the why of bravangelism)- [before and after pics](http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/15qnxl/before_and_after_sizes/) - this gives anecdotal stories that shows the benefits both functionally, aesthetically, etc., [Don't believe your new size?](http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/wiki/quick#wiki_learning_what_bra_sizes_really_mean), Visual aids and links to posts such as this one [thinandcurvy](http://www.thinandcurvy.com/2011/05/where-to-find-26-and-24-band-bras-and.html) help further demonstrate the difference in aesthetics a good bra can have.
* After you've demonstrated that there is such a thing as a ""better bra"", then they'll be more open and willing to look for it :) So now provide ample resources on the what, how and where of bravangelism :) Basically this subreddit and any of the links in the sidebar
* Consider pm-ing them so as to avoid ""calling them out in public"". Some people may be shy and would rather be told privately.
* Some may also find PM's too private.
* At the end of the day, it's still their boobs/bra
* Don't wish them boob problems for not listening (I'm guilty of this in my head...)

**When dealing with strangers in real life**

* Just don't do it
Some have made it known that they would find it incredibly rude if a stranger approaches them about bras in real life. Please think long and hard about whether its possible that you can indirectly help a stranger on bras (that's kind of intimate!, and they may be perfectly fine as they are). As always, treat others as you'd like to be treated and respect that not everyone is like you.

* Be anonymous
* Leave a business card somewhere detailing proper bra fitting and resources; do not hand it to someone! The point is anonymity, so leave it somewhere and not with someone. And do not stick it in someone's purse or something.

* More direct - only do this if it can be an off-hand comment not directed at someone in particular or that would allow them to inquire about fit

Theoretical situation (I've seen it a couple of times posted here): You hear a lady (or a couple of ladies) talking about how their bras don't quite feel right. Or maybe there are a bunch of ""weird"" bra sizes and they're complaining about not being able to find theirs.

* Approach by slipping into the presented situation and drawing the topic of bras onto yourself so as not to be seen as critiquing the other ladies' bosoms themselves. (For example: Oh yeah, if you see a 28HH let me know. Or, I love the new bras I bought at Nordstrom's in 34FF. This allows them to ask if they want to know, or dismiss you. 
* If they ask, be excited in the difference YOU feel instead of being pushy or dwelling on the negative
* Be polite
* Accept that not everyone will listen; still their boobs/bra
* Please please please do not approach someone directly about the fit of their bra - quite a few people have made it known that it would make them uncomfortable and isn't the point of bravangelism comfort? Be respectful

**Dealing with closer relationships**

* If you know them well, you'll also know how to bring up the topic or slide it into a conversation when the opportunity presents itself. You would hopefully also know what they'll best respond to vs. what gets under their skin
* Be polite
* Be patient, accepting, and definitely not pushy
* Accept defeat if its time

Anddd that's what I have so far. It obviously needs some work so feedback would be awesome :)

I have seen the light.,secretstosay,81,14,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/1gso0j/fawning_over_what_rabrathatfits_seems_to_think_is/,"Yesterday evening I wrote a post about not being able to find bras without padding and generally complaining about how hard it is to find a bra. So, I took some advice I gathered from this subreddit and went to Nordstroms. Wow. It was amazing. Yes, everything was more expensive than the cheap stuff I've been buying my whole post-puberty life, but it was worth it! 

First of all, they let me stay well after the store had actually closed. Their selection was amazing. The sales girl's skills in bra sizing were spot on, as opposed to the three other stores I've visited in the past year, who each gave me different wrong size and fit options, to where I just left the store frustrated. After confirming that the bra I liked was the right size (32D), this sales girl picked up two other bras I had tried on that were in the right size, but fit terribly, and said, ""I can tell right away that these aren't going to work for you."" She didn't even know I tried them on and hated them, but knew they weren't right for me and came back with another bra that was absolutely gorgeous, unpadded (even though I hadn't asked about that), and fit like some kind of fantasy.

So, I bought two well-fitted bras. Right now I am wearing one as I type and it actually feels *good* to wear it. So great. Thanks for all the little lessons and store suggestions.

I've been reading for a while and it's been helpful but I only just now decided to measure myself.

My band measurement, as tight as possible, is 27.25ish inches. Snug but not super tight is about 28 or 29.

When I lean over, I measure 32-33"". (I keep getting different measurements every time)

I think this makes me a 28D/DD? Right now I'm wearing a 32A Aerie Ella Gel, and it is a bit narrow and gapes a little at the top, which shouldn't make sense since it's an A, but I think it's because the band isn't tight enough to make the cups sit right. I'm not sure where to go after the size information though.

I have a very petite, androgynous body, but there are still a bunch of considerations...

* I'm pretty sure my ribcage is wider than average even though it's not very masculine
* My boobs are kind of set far apart
* There is really not a lot of tissue there.
* I'm a little bit conical
* I fluctuate weights a lot and am trying to put on both muscle and a bit of fat, as I am literally skin and bones right now.
* I'm still growing, I hope, but it's not very predictable

So does anybody have any suggestions? I'm worried about size changes affecting my choices (I still want nice bras in the meantime but I don't want them all to stop fitting in a few weeks/months...)

The tough part after you find a size is finding a bra that matches your profile, ie, shallow (I think) and wide set. I don't really know where to start on this, or where is a good place to order bras (I am in the US and on a decently small budget!)

Thanks for your help :)

All my life, I've been the girl with ""small boobs"". I'm slightly below average height, very thin, and for years I've been wearing a 34A. I found this subreddit this morning, right before I went out shopping for my birthday. I noticed that my bra band was riding up and I was having all sorts of side-boob. Before, I hadn't really thought much of it. I'm the girl with small boobs. I buy bras most of my friends wore in middle school.

But everything changed today. I didn't have enough time to measure myself or have someone do it for me, but I did keep all of the things I read in mind while I shopped. I tried a 32B to start with, and the wires were digging into my chest. In the past, I always thought this was a problem with the band, which was why I'd size up to a 34 band. I was also still having some side-boob, although it wasn't really that much for me to pay much attention. At least, in the past I wouldn't have. Today I knew better, and although I felt a little skeptical, I told my mom to help me find a 32C.

She said I was crazy, that it simply wasn't possible that I wore a size that big. (I have the smallest boobs in my family, how could I be a C-cup?) I even thought it was a little crazy at first. But then I put that bra on and oh my goodness, it fit like a dream. I even got re-dressed, walked back out into the store, and dragged my mom back in the dressing room with me, just so she could check to make sure I wasn't just imagining it out of wishful thinking. I wasn't. I am a 32C.

That was when I realized how arbitrary most of our ideas of ""small boobs"" vs. ""big boobs"" are. Like... I don't know whether I'm still the small-boobed girl I've been all my life just because I found out I'm actually 2 cup sizes bigger. My boobs are the same, but because I now wear an ""average"" cup does that suddenly make me an average-boobed girl? It's all rather silly, and really puts into perspective how many people are wearing the wrong size. All my poor ""C-cup"" friends must be so uncomfortable in their too-small bras!

 Anyways, I never, ever, in a million years would have thought to grab a C-cup bra without this subreddit. Thank you so, so much.

So I browsed through their website and entered all of their bras in [Yet Another Google Docs Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AlBiv70loESMdFlqZnVBMEFtQjJnNmZ5RUtackpqT3c&amp;usp=sharing).

And now for some numbers!

* Number of ""unique"" bras offered: 73
* Average price of all bras (not on sale): $47.28
* Percentage of bras with the word ""sexy"" or ""sexier"" or ""sexiest"" in the description: 57%
* Percentage of bras that can be worn strapless: 12%
* Percentage of bras that have moulded cups: ~~79%~~ **75%**
* Percentage of bras with some amount of push-up: 45%
* Percentage of bras sold that are unlined: ~~5%~~ **7%**
* Percentage of bras that are either demi or plunge in shape: 67%
* Percentage of bras that are either demi or plunge in shape, not including sports bras: 77%
* Percentage of sports bras that have some amount of push-up: 25%

Various notes: ""unique"" means bras with a separate complete name/listing (everything except color differences).  I'm fairly certain I got all of them, but I wouldn't doubt it if I missed a bra or two.  VS offers several bras that they call ""unlined"" that are, in reality, lightly lined moulded cup bras, as far as I can tell.  Also, the line between ""plunge"" and ""demi"" is pretty blurry for their bras, so I did the best I could assigning labels.  Every bra called ""Perfect Coverage"" I called three-quarters cup, even though that may or may not be the best description.

Anyways, I just thought y'all would find this interesting.

1359672808.0,69,self.ABraThatFits,17npfs,I saw an interesting bra website (True&amp;Co) on HelloGiggles. I went ahead and called the company. Here is the conversation I had. ,nifflerqueen,79,10,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/17npfs/i_saw_an_interesting_bra_website_trueco_on/,"Hello Ladies!

Apologizes for the awkward title and the long wall of text ahead. I thought you may be interested in the small journey I just embarked. 

I saw an interesting [article on HelloGiggles](http://hellogiggles.com/finding-the-perfect-bra-without-some-strange-lady-touching-your-boobs) about a bra website called [True&amp;Co](https://trueandco.com/how_it_works). The author explains:
 &gt; *You fill out an online form, get five bras in the mail, try them on, then keep the ones you like and send back the ones you donât with specifics about why they werenât for you. You are only charged for the pieces you keep and return shipping is free.*

I was excited to hear about this great company until I read the author was a 34A. I understand that some women may be this size, but the overwhelming majority do not have a 1"" difference between their bust and band. I am not sure if I should email the author or not. I do not want to seem all high and mighty. *(Sidenote: If you are a 34A, I am sorry and do not intend to belittle your size).*

So I head over to the website to take their quiz to get my correct bra size. The company prides itself in finding the perfect bra without having to measure oneself. I end up with the same ill-fiting brasize I have now. Despite being intrigued by the concept, I am a bit disappointed. I proceed to call the company for more answers. I was surprised to be greeted by a actual human being! She was super friendly and informative. 

**1. Where are you located?**

&gt;Their office is located in San Francisco (a road trip away from me :D ). Their warehouse is located on the east coast. 

**2. Do you take into account women with ill-fitting bras ordering more ill-fitting bras not knowing what a good fit looks like?**

&gt;The women explained the process of ordering five bras and being able to return those that don't fit. She said the customers do end up with the correct size by trial and error. Free returns help. I said my opinion is that most women do not wear the correct bra size due to the fact that they do not know the signs of an ill-fitting bra. We giggled about Victoria's Secret placing me at a 36C when I should be wearing a 30E. 
&gt;
&gt;She also explained that the company is rather new and they hope to add more to the website, such as signs of an ill-fitting bra and how to measure for a correct fit. 

**3. How would you recommend that I measure myself?**

&gt;She said that it really depends on what each manufacturer says and sizes can vary from company to company. She explained to measure my band size and then add (cringe) how ever many inches as the manufacturer says. 
&gt;
&gt;She paused. In the kindest voice I could muster, I explained I was disappointed in her answer as this is how most women get ill fitted: by wearing bands too large and subsequently cups too small. She explained that is just depends on the person. For example she is a 30E like me, but prefers a 32DD or 34D for comfort.

**4. What is the smallest band you carry? What is the largest cup size in that band?**

&gt;Unfortunately the smallest band they carry is a 30. She could not remember what the largest cup is for that band. I do know they have at least a 30E. I did not ask about larger band sizes. I'm sorry. 
&gt;
&gt;She explained True&amp;Co plans on carrying a larger selection of bands in the future. However, they are a new company. I explained that a selection of smaller bands in larger cups would be grand. I also went on to explain that I am part of a community of women online dedicated to finding bras that fit . Often times we order bras from the UK because they provide a larger selection that is lacking in the US. I said it would be great if True&amp;Co would be able to provide that niche in my own state.

Their backs hurt, their shoulders hurt, they were embarrassed because of the size of their breasts, etc. 

I don't want to trivialize the decision to have surgery, nor the problems associated with having breasts large enough to want to consider it. I really hope I'm not being insensitive to anyone here who's had a reduction. I just feel really upset that women have had to undergo the surgery when maybe they didn't have to. 

A good friend of mine had a breast reduction when she was 15, and she said the recovery was awful. From what she said, her breasts weren't big enough to be sized out of anything you could find on Brastop or Figleaves (she was really skinny and wearing DD bras). She's had lots of weight fluctuations due to Graves disease, so she's really embarrassed by the current appearance of her breasts and how they've reacted to the weight fluctuations. I just keep thinking that if she were in the right bra from the start, she wouldn't have had to go through all that. 

Here's my question: based on the fact that most women don't know how to measure themselves properly and are wearing the wrong size, would some of these breast reductions have been preventable by wearing the correct bra size? It seems so silly to me that something as major as surgery could be prevented by something so simple as a properly fitting bra, but yet... is it?

EDIT: I want to make it very clear that I am not judging anyone for or being dismissive of the decision to have breast reduction surgery. Having surgery is not an easy decision, and having any kind of breast surgery - reconstruction, lift, implant, reduction, etc, is incredibly personal. I apologize if anyone felt like I was dismissive or judgmental. That was not my intention at all. We have to make the decisions that are best for us and our lifestyles, and different people will make different decisions based on a multitude of factors.

In these pictures, there is a very mild amount of wrinkling in the bottom of the cups, but this was fixed by doing a better swoop-and-scoop than I did when I put the bra on. I also have (since yesterday) realized that this bra wasn't sitting high enough on my sternum-- the underwires weren't sitting right at the breast root, and by moving it up just a touch and adjusting the strap, it helped the issue.

I find the band to be snug-- maybe a cm or so more snug than other Cleo bras of the same size, but I expect it will relax slightly with wear, and it isn't causing discomfort. I just noticed that the two hooks look a bit like they are pulling some, but it doesn't feel that way.

Sigh. 

I try to explain that cup size is dependent on band size. I try to explain that even though I have a shallow shape, I still need wires wide enough to cover all of my breast tissue. 

Today I was telling my friend I wish I could find padded push up bras made in my size (36FF or 38F depending on the style.) She was like- ""just look at Dillard's! I know you think you need size FFF or whatever but I know tons of girls with way bigger boobs than you and they can buy bras at normal places.""

Also, when I took her bra shopping, she REFUSED to try on any DDDs, even when we went down band sizes. At least I got her out of a B. She still had spillage on the sides in the bras we settled on because she refused to try on anything bigger. 

What will it take to change the mentality of so many women? Even though I didn't know a lot about bras before I found this subreddit, I could tell mine were awful and immediately was willing to try a new approach. 

I think for my friend, it comes down to body image. She is convinced she has small, weirdly shaped boobs, and it's her fault that ""normal"" bras don't fit, so she settles. I don't want women to settle! We should all feel awesome about our boobs!

It never occurred to me that I'd been in the wrong size so I measured myself according to the sidebar guide as a 30/32 F/G



My measurements in case they're relevant:

underbust super tight - 28""

underbust just snug - 30.5""

bust standing - 37""

bust bent over - 38""



I asked at the couple department stores I have nearby (Macy's and JC Penney's) and wasn't surprised to hear that they didn't really have anything near my size, but they recommended a boutique nearby that has a wider range of sizes. 

I drove over and the lady who greeted me was friendly and said she'd get me started and then the expert would be back from wherever she was and she'd advise me on fit. I told her I measured as a 30/32 F/G and she gave me a couple 32 Fs which were the closest they had. I went into the dressing room and by the time I had the first one on the expert had arrived.

I thought the bra was a little small in the cups but the expert told me it looked perfect, informed me the price range was $75-$100, and asked me what I was looking for. I told her these were the first bras I'd found to try on, so I just wanted to see a variety and explore what fit me best. 

She came back with a couple 32 Fs, which I thought were also too small of cups but she insisted that they fit me right, and started to get pretty pushy about trying to get me to buy something. Then she went out and brought back a 34 C, telling me ""the cups run large."" That one was so small even she admitted it, and came back with a 34 D of the same band. It was too small in the cups and too large in the band, but she tried her best to convince me that it was perfect and asked me if I was ready to pick one. I pointed out the breast tissue poking out of the cups under my arms, and the gore squished over my boobs instead of against my chest and she told me ""those are just things you need to accept as a woman. You can't be perfect."" I reminded her that I measured myself as a much different size than she was trying to fit me in, and she got a little ruder and said ""there's no way you're that size. You can't fit a bra by measuring. You're dreaming, sweetheart."" 

I guess I'll try ordering a few offline from somewhere with free returns, and see if I can get my size. It's a bit more of a hassle, but there's a much wider selection if I'm looking online which is nice. I'm a little discouraged but ready to try again. c:




TL/DR: I went to a specialty bra boutique to try some on, got squished into wrong sized, expensive bras by a rude pushy saleslady. I'll probably order offline now.


So I guess my question is, what are your suggestions for online bra shopping in my size range?

Today they finally got here, one in a 30F, one in a 30FF since it was supposed to run small - and when I put them on, they didn't fit. At all. Both were loose enough to already be hooked on the tightest hook and giving me quadboob. Uh, what?? I brushed it off, deciding they must not be true to size, and thought, oh well, they work okay, too late to return them.

I took in the gore on one, since it seemed wide on top of everything else and I was hoping it would tighten the band and open up the cups, and when I was in my sewing kit my eyes happened to fall on my tape measure. Merely out of curiosity, I decided to check my measurements.

Then, I decided to throw the freaking tape measure. I am no longer the 30.5/37 that I was a week ago. Oh no. Now I am measuring 28.5/38. BOOBS. WHAT THE HELL. This must be remigration, since I have only been in my 30FF instead of my 32Es for a week and a half or so, but I had no armpit fat! Or rib fat or anything! This is not fair. I wish I could demand that my boobs pay for the shipping costs of an exchange for some 28GGs (cause I sure don't have enough money in my bank account for it,) but I feel like that takes me into shady sorts of business.

ARGH.

I started this subreddit because I'm always at about 110% boob discomfort.

I wear a **38F UK** according to most sizing adventures, was wearing a 42DDD US before I was resized.

Has this helped me find better bras? No, of course not. 

What have I done?

I've been to Nordstrom, Intimacy, and Soma - all of which offer lovely bras supposedly in my size. I've ordered tons of bras online. 

The bras I purchased from Intimacy are arguably my ""nicest"" bras - but they are full coverage - so high that I can't wear many of my shirts (which are not particularly revealing). And they are lace so they can't be worn under any shirt that is thin, slightly sheer, or a dress shirt. And the best part? Despite the fact that they are FULL coverage, they do cut in to my boobs (which are fairly high) and give me some quadraboob. 

For a t-shirt bra, I wear some ones I purchased at Lane Bryant but altered. The straps fall off my shoulders even though they ""fit"" and I do the proper ""swoop and scoop.""

I can't not wear bras. I'm a professional and it would be totally unacceptable for me to not wear a bra. The non-underwire ones do not provide enough support to look even remotely nice under clothes, and my breasts start hurting after a while.

Sports bras? HA. Don't even get me started.

So you've done a measurement check and have got your new size(s).  What now?  Where in the world do you find a new bra in this ""outrageous"" (not really) new size?  And is it going to have to cost $100 or more?

Well, before I answer any of these questions, I'm going answer one you haven't asked yet:

**You will not find your perfect new bra on the first try.**

You probably won't find it on your second or third try, either.  **This is normal.**  If you find your perfect bra in your first online order, you are incredibly lucky.

This is said not to crush your hopes and dreams, but rather to shift your expectations more in line with reality.

Okay, back to your original questions.  There are many places to buy new bras, and you can pay as much or as little as you want to for them.  Here's some different scenarios that may apply to you.
_____
**You haven't pinned down your size/shape yet, and you want a place with free shipping and free returns.**

* [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/) - Free shipping/returns only for Prime Eligible items. Make sure to double check, as some colors/sizes of a particular bra will be Prime Eligible, and other colors/sizes of the same bra will *not* be Prime Eligible.  If you do not have Amazon Prime, these items will be instead marked Super Saver eligible (if you spend $25+, shipping is free).
* [Nordstrom](http://shop.nordstrom.com/)
* [ASOS](http://us.asos.com/) - uses a weird sizing system

* [Brastop](http://brastop.com/) - UK-based.  Great deals on the Big Names (Freya, Cleo, Curvy Kate, etc).
* [Figleaves](http://www.figleaves.com/us/) - UK-based.  Great deals and great selection of brands, sizes, and non-standard bras (basques, bustiers, corsets, bodies, camis, babydolls, etc).

Of course, not all vendors carry all sizes.  If you're outside the Bra Matrix, please consult the spreadsheet linked directly above about where you can find bras in your size.

______

Remember - it is incredibly rare for you to get Your Perfect Bra on your first order/outing.  Treat each bra as a learning tool, so that you can choose a better bra for you in the future.  Be patient, and try not to get frustrated!  You can always come back to this subreddit (or Bratabase) for fit checks and advice.

If you are still figuring out your new size, you are setting yourself up for failure if you're buying several different bras of the same size. Even if you think there is only one size you could be, don't be surprised if your measurements don't perfectly match your ideal size. The guides on this subreddit are only a starting point, as anyone here will be quick to tell you.  Your comfort and happiness is the top priority.

And don't forget to check reviews on Bratabase before you buy anything!
_____

So you might find yourself with a bra that you can't return.  Maybe you missed the return window, maybe the vendor doesn't accept returns, or maybe return shipping is more than the bra is worth.  What now?

Luckily, you've got a few options.

**/r/Braswap**: This is a great place to sell bras that are common ""new"" sizes.  You can also sell your gently used bras here.  This is not a good place to offload your two-year-old 34C Victoria's Secret bras.

**/r/RandomActsofBras**: This subreddit is for giving away bras.  If the bras are in any rougher condition than ""gently used,"" make sure you are *incredibly* thorough in describing their condition.  You might have luck giving away your old sizes, as some are willing to sew/alter them down to the size they need.

**[Bratabase](http://www.bratabase.com)**: Much like Braswap, here you can list your bras for sale, but you may not have much luck selling your bras in your old size.  Similarly, you may have a hard time selling bras for full price.

**[eBay](http://www.ebay.com/)**: Anything goes.

**[Craigslist](http://www.craigslist.org/about/sites)**: Potentially a great way to actually get money out of your old-size bras that are still in good condition.  At least consider giving them a note with a link to this place after you seal the deal. :p

**[Clothes for Boobs](https://www.facebook.com/groups/261128837304402/)**: Facebook buy/sell/trade group.  Mostly for fuller busts.

**[Clothes &amp; Bra Exchange/Selling](https://www.facebook.com/groups/180836295294846/)**: Facebook buy/sell/trade group

**Charities**: There are many charities that accept new and gently used bras.  Browse through and find the one that speaks to you.

* [Bra Recycling](http://www.brarecycling.com/) - For recycling and reusing bras
* [Free The Girls](http://freethegirls.org/) - For survivors of sex trafficking
* [Donate Your Bra](http://www.donateyourbra.com/) - For breast cancer survivors
* [Uplift Bras](http://www.upliftbras.org/) - For women in disadvantaged communities

I tried this bra on her recommendation alone after somewhat swearing off Panache balconettes due to the high wires in the Tango II and Sienna.

[**Photos**](http://imgur.com/a/edH1y)

It took me a while to put this baby on. I'm not sure why, but the hooks and eyes would not click and the tension in the band with my sore arms (helped a friend move last night) was sort of a disaster. But I prevailed, and could not be more satisfied.

The underwires on this bra feel perfect. I mean it. **Perfect** for me. And the top lace is perfect. And the lift is perfect. And the firm band feels perfect.

The only possible thing I can criticize on this bra is that straps are still pretty wide set, but they don't seem to rub much so it is beneath my radar.

I am thrilled with the improvement this is over even my Cleo Marcie, which I've been pretty happy about for the last couple of days. This feels even better than my Junas! I might even go so far as to say I like it better than - *gasp* - my Elomi Asia.

The silhouette is pointier than I normally go for, but it is so subtle that I actually kind of like it. Freya's point always weirded me out because my breasts are so wide that it looked like pizza slices on my chest, but this feels great.

I am sort of on a bra high right now about this, so sorry to ramble, and I hope nobody feels bad about critiquing the fit and raining on my parade. I need to hear all the feedback! If you fine folks agree this is a good shape and size for me, can you recommend any similar bras?

**Edit:** Thanks everybody for being so supportive and awesome :) After half a day of wear through driving, errands, cleaning house, and swift walking in a cross-chest backpack, I am still really pleased. The top of the gore might need to be bent out a touch, but for the first time I am staying inside my underwires without adjusting every 5 minutes.

I spent most of my life convinced I was a 34B.  Figured the extra around my armpit area was just chub, and that to go up a size in bra I had to increase my band size too (nope!).  About a month ago I had finally gone up to a C, and this, yes THIS, was a much better fit.  Or so I thought.  The gore of the bra was so far off my chest I could see straight down to my toes.  Hubby swoops in to the rescue just a couple days ago with a link to this subreddit, and I checked it out.  After a moment of hilarity trying to measure myself (got beeped at because I forgot to close the living room curtains, oops), got my new size.  34DD.  I couldn't believe it, and was convinced it was wrong.  Determined to prove to myself that the internet couldn't possible know how big my chest was, I went to a department store to try on some bras, armed with new knowledge about fit.  I grabbed a 34D and a 34DD for comparison, again convinced that they would be huge.  

The 34D was too small. I was actually falling out of the cups a bit.  The 34DD?  PERFECT FIT.  I nearly cried.  I had never been so comfortable in my life.  In one single moment, years of self-image issues and hard-headedness were forced to confront this single fact: for the first time in my life, I was wearing a bra that fit.  There was no extra 'chub' on the sides near my armpits.  My breasts sat nicely in the cups without threatening to spill out everywhere.  I couldn't see the floor between the bra and my skin.  My silhouette was smoother.  

This was honestly nothing short of an epiphany, and it was entirely thanks to this subreddit and the lovely ladies (and encouraging guys!) here.  Thank you all, so very much.

I like to peruse this subreddit as well as /r/femalefashionadvice and I often see people talking about themselves being an A-cup, only to have a lot of people reply saying, ""no, no, you can't be an A-cup! Go to /r/abrathatfits and see you're not an A-cup!"" even when there isn't a picture posted, or sometimes, the picture is posted, and the person looks really small. 

So WHAT exactly is an A-cup? I saw a very small-chested woman post a picture and someone said they could ""just tell they weren't an A-cup."" As a fellow flat-chested girl, she looked pretty flat to me.

Again, as an A-cup myself, I'm really wondering, how small do you have to be to be an A-cup? Yes I know a 34A (what I wear) is basically a 30C or something (so I've heard) but is it truly impossible for a person to be a 34A? I always see comments that it's better to go up to the 30C. So, why is that better? What's the difference? 

It's just weird for me because I've always considered being an ""A-cup"" as a pretty big part of my identity (hahaha) so to hear that I should go up to a B or C is weird to me.  

Also, I've noticed, aside from this subreddit, I don't think most other people understand the whole bra sizing thing, at all. Ask any ""civilian"" out there, man, woman, etc, and all of them would probably say, A=flat chested boy, D=huge.

Maybe you enthusiasts can help me with my predicament... :-)

I've been taking phytoestrogens for a few months now to enhance my chest, and I've put on a fair amount of tissue. The problem is finding a bra that fits! My breasts are extremely shallow, I think due to the male size of my chest. Even when I try bras that are suited to shallow breasts, it's hard to get them to cover the horizontal area of my chest. Seeing well fitting bras, I've noticed the cup tends to wrap around the side of the body a little bit... but my bras never do.

I measure 38 inches around the bust leaning over, 37.5 inches standing up, and my underbust is 35.25 inches around. That would imply I would wear about a 36B, right? But every 36 band I've tried is too loose. I have to wear a 34 to get any support at all. I think my shoulder blades exaggerate my underbust measurement, and maybe my bust measurement too because I can't fill that cup volume at all in most bras.

Best fit I've found as been Timpa Duet in 34C. But I end up with escaped breast tissue between the cups and my arms, on the front of my chest if I don't adjust the bra constantly. And in other bras, I can't even fill a 34B (I read Duet runs small). I can sort of fill a 34B Freya Deco, but only if I swoop and scoop very aggressively and the extra tissue falls out if I move at all! But band-wise, all the 34 inch bands I've tried have been really good.

Does anyone have any suggestions for bras that could cater to my wide roots and shallow breasts? Soft cup is definitely preferred...

I found that the difference between the underbust before and after remigration is very significant with a p-value less than .0001 and a confidence interval of 1.525 to 2.475.  The p-value means that I failed to prove the null hypothesis (that the underbust would not change after wearing a correctly fitted bra).  The exactly number means that if it assumed that wearing the correct size bra will not change the underbust measurement, then in less than 0.01% of samples will results be this extreme.  However, that does not mean that I proved the alternate hypothesis (that the underbust measurement would change after wearing a correctly fitted bra) because it's very difficult to prove anything definitively when we're talking scientifically or statistically.  The confidence interval means that the middle 95% of the data fell into a difference of 1.525 to 2.475 inch difference before and after wearing the correctly sized bra.

The bust results also had very statistically significant results.  The p-value for the bust results was 0.0007, which is also considered to be very statistically significant.  This means that in 0.07% of samples if it is assumed that the bust measurement will not change after wearing the correctly sized bra will yield results this extreme.  This means that it is extremely unlikely that bust measurements will not change after wearing the correctly sized bra and that we failed to prove the null hypothesis.  The confidence interval is -1.779 to -0.555, meaning that the middle 95% of the population experiences an increase in bust measurement of between .555 and 1.779 inches after wearing the correctly sized bra.

So while it is impossible to prove an alternative hypothesis in statistics, the data shows that it is very uncommon for someone's bust and underbust measurement not to change after wearing the correct sized bra.

You can dye your bras!,Avi_,60,6,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/192ffj/im_weirdly_excited_about_this_you_can_dye_your/,"Last weekend, some dummy at a party caused me to spill a bunch of red wine on my favourite ivory lace top. I tried everything to get it out, but the stain persisted. So I bought a box of Rit dye in the ""wine"" shade (haha). 

I had extra dye after doing the shirt and a couple others and wondered if I could dye my bras. I started with [this](http://www.ewa-michalak.pl/product-eng-301-CHP-Brzoskwinka.html) bra, which was starting to look a little dingy after I accidentally washed it with a pair of jeans. 20 minutes in the dye bath later, I got [this!](http://imgur.com/sdfA5Rb,bOB3HJV) 

The color is a few shades off what I got from the shirt (probably due to the different fiber content), but I'm still happy with the result. Areas like the powernet at the wings, seams at the inside of the cups, and the casings for the underwires didn't take the dye as well as the cup and wings did, but it's a definite improvement. Now I have a fun pink bra. :)

It got me thinking... I've seen a couple people unhappy that so-called ""nude"" bras are usually only available in [beige ](http://cdn.breakoutbras.com/images/uploads/DECONUDE.jpg)like this. While it would be awesome if more bra companies made bras in [nude](http://images.bravissimo.com/products/bp-au01mob-large.jpg) [shades](http://i1303.photobucket.com/albums/ag157/MsUnderpinnings/Medium/BravAndorraMink_zps27f83a92.jpg) [for](http://www.ewa-michalak.pl/data/gfx/icons/large/1/5/351.jpg) [everybody](http://images.asos-media.com/inv/media/2/0/2/8/2508202/blush/image1xl.jpg), we could buy beige/white bras in our sizes and dye them to our own custom shade of nude. For someone as pale as me, most ""nudes"" are actually darker than my skin tone, so this is definitely something I will consider doing again with a white bra and some carefully diluted dye.

Now, use caution if you choose to do this. Read instructions so you don't ruin anything, yadda yadda. And be reasonable. You're probably not going to be able to get a navy blue bra to be bright orange. But you might be able to get a red bra by dying a pink bra, or a sunny yellow from dying a white bra.

I believe I was in a 34C at the time.

I hit age 15 or so and realized the bras I had were not cutting it. I measured myself at home, using the recommended overbust measurement technique that I came up with online, and as ignorant as I was even then I realized the 38B that I came up with could not be right. With some more help from Google, I discovered that some people had to use a different technique, measuring ribcage instead of overbust. Unfortunately, the site I found still did the +4 measurement. 34D sounded more likely, and when I tried them on and found that my boobs actually fit into the cups of the bra, I was happy.

By my senior year of high school, though, everyone else's boobs had come in and mine suddenly didn't seem so great. In fact, they were sad and embarrassing - I had no cleavage to speak of, and even though i wore a bigger bra size than some of my friends, my chest looked the same or smaller. I decided that I must have had saggy boobs, and proceeded to become ashamed and bitter about my chest :(

Last year, upon the appearance of quadboobing (or double bubble, as my friends and I nicknamed it,) I hesitantly moved into a 34DD (US), feeling as though I had somehow manipulated the numbers to make myself sound good - but the bras fit. Well, sort of. I wasn't getting any lift, and when I tightened the straps enough to get the girls to perk up at all, the band ended up literally on top of my shoulder blades.

I sat down with google, and [Linda the Bra Lady's website](http://www.lindasonline.com/bra-problem-guide.html) saved my self-confidence when I was just about ready to give up. What do you know! It turns out I did not have abnormal boobs, or saggy ones... but that my bra wasn't fitting.

Now, foolishly, instead of measuring, I simply followed Linda's recommendation and went down a band size (and up a cup size accordingly.) The Victoria's Secret in my smallish town didn't even stock the 32DDDs, but I tried on the 32DDs and realized I needed the triple D offline (US sizing again, obv.) I probably would have stuck with this happily until my boobs changed size except for one thing - I was a broke, broke college student. (Still am, actually.) I couldn't afford bras in my size, which tended to be around 60 dollars from the Victoria's Secret website and never went on sale. I didn't even think any other companies made the size!

Finally, my Redditor boyfriend directed me to ABTF. I rolled my eyes and said ""But my bras fit!"" but he convinced me that you guys might have some ideas about retailers that I could afford. I measured myself to make sure I had my UK size right according to the MWB guide, and what do you know.... I measure at a 30F (UK)! -- and then there was BraStop.

In all seriousness, I cried the first time I saw the BraStop prices. I had given up on being able to afford bras in my size and resigned myself to the 34Ds that I could get at Penney's. Now that I'm finally in A Bra That Fits, I have nicer looking boobs, as well - and significantly less back pain. I have scoliosis and my old bands would ride up and put pressure right across the problem area - but now they stay in place!

So anyway, the point of this super long rambling post is A) THANK YOU. Thank you so much, ABTF. and B) DON'T GIVE UP. A bra that really fits is worth the struggle of pinning down your size - you'll look great and you'll feel way better.

Do you think you have shallow breasts?  Do you have no clue at all?  Do you not even know what shallow breasts look like? Do you have no idea what kind of bras to buy for shallow breasts?  Well, you've come to the right post, because here I will hopefully answer as many questions as I can regarding shallow breasts with wide roots.

**What are shallow breasts with a wide root?**

Simply put, shallow breasts with a wide root have their breast tissue spread out much more evenly across the chest than most ladies.  While most people have more projection with a smaller base, shallow breasts usually have much less projection across a larger base.  Often, a person with shallow breasts has breast tissue that starts all the way up near the collarbone.

**Okay, so what do shallow breasts with wide roots look like?**

[Here's a diagram of some different shallow breasts vs. someone with more projection](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hnIpeGDU2WE/UEYGVHZOCgI/AAAAAAAAA20/AkCVXUtLzcE/s1600/shallow+breasts.jpg) (mostly SFW).  You'll notice that the slope of the breast starts up much higher than the far right breasts.  In addition, a non-negligible amount of tissue (compared to the total amount of tissue) is underneath that top half of the curve.  From a top-down perspective, shallow breasts with a wide root look like [figure X on this diagram](http://i.imgur.com/1GZ7tSx.jpg).

**Right, but what do they *really* look like?**

Luckily, Venusian\*Glow has done some of that legwork already!  [Here's some living, breathing examples of shallow breasts](http://www.venusianglow.com/2013/03/examples-of-shallow-breasts-nsfw.html) (Very NSFW).  You'll notice in 3/4 and profile shots that there is a smooth curve from the collarbone down to the nipple on every person, but there doesn't seem to be much projection going on.

**What are some other possible indicators of shallow breasts with wide roots?**

* Many bras, especially plunges, cut into your breast tissue at the top edge of the cup, but you never seem to be able to fill out the cup itself.
* The bra size you come up with using [The Guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/rh26h/is_getting_fitted_for_a_bra_as_humiliating_as_it/c469bi0) seems to be giving you a size that is much too large from what you look like.  Note: this is different than the sticker shock of learning your new size (for example, going from a 36D to a 32FF).  What I mean is that when you look at other people who wear the same size bra as you, they seem to have much bigger breasts.
* Professional fitters often get your band size correct, but severely underestimate your cup size.
* Shallow shapes are extremely common in cupsizes A-E and bandsizes 28-32.  However, shallow breasts outside that range are definitely not unheard of.
* When you try on an unlined bra, it often seems like it's simultaneously too big and too small, like [this](http://www.bratabase.com/browse/fantasie/annabelle-side-support-bra/30D/pictures/) (NSFW).
* You are trans*\.
* You would describe your breasts as more teardrop-shaped than round/spherical.

**What are some things to look for when choosing a bra?**

Finding bras that work for ladies with shallow breasts and wide roots is a challenge.  Most bras have too much projection, which creates an [""orange-in-a-glass"" appearance](http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/15skno/the_bras_in_my_supposed_size_fit_weird_and_im_not/c7phuxw).  Specifically, here's some indicators that the bra you're looking at might work for you:

* The cups have only vertical seams, and no horizontal seams.
* The top edge of the cups is as close to horizontal as possible.
* The top edge is open (vertical), not closed (curved in towards the body).

Please note: these are just suggestions for new bras, or bras that haven't been reviewed anywhere.  Many bras that follow these guidelines won't work for shallow breasts, and many bras that follow none of these guidelines *do* work for shallow breasts.  Your best bet is to look up reviews and measurements on [Bratabase](http://www.bratabase.com/).  When there doesn't seem to be much data available on the bra you're looking at, refer back to these three points for guidance.

Also note: many bras labeled as *balconette* follow the three guidelines above, and generally work for shallow breasts.  However, balconettes generally do not work for ladies who wear a larger cup size but are still shallow.

**Which bras will most likely work for someone with shallow breasts?**

* Lepel Fiore Padded Plunge (Please note that the bras from Spring 2013 have a slightly different cut and do not work as well.  They also may make your breasts look especially pointy.  Avoid the colors from SS13, Sky Blue/Lemon and Sweet Lemonade.  Lepel has indicated that they will go back to the good cut for Fall 2013.)

All of this information comes from **[this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AlBiv70loESMdDVYb0RJcHZoUEE4WFZrUkk2ZFN3Y0E&amp;usp=sharing)**, which is a combination of data from this community and data from a similar German community.  I **highly** recommend browsing through it.  There's a lot more information there than can be presented here, for the sake of brevity.  And, as always, if you wish to be added to the spreadsheet, just shoot me a message and I'd be happy to add you.

Here's a brief list of other information that can be gathered from [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AlBiv70loESMdDVYb0RJcHZoUEE4WFZrUkk2ZFN3Y0E&amp;usp=sharing):

* Which bras to buy if you're looking for a specific shape, style, or amount of padding
* If you have a smaller or larger band size, which bras are available in your size
* Other bras that may or may not work, but there's simply not enough data yet to tell whether they're likely to work for a majority of those with shallow breasts
* Information on a very select number of brands/styles of swimwear
* Specifically which bras have worked for other people in your size range

I would like to take a minute to emphasize that last point.  Those of you with larger shallow breasts often show different fitting trends than those with smaller shallow breasts.  As the former is much less common, there's not a lot of data on it yet.  As such, many of the bras that are likely to fit are just more likely to fit on smaller shallow breasts.  So it is especially important for those of you with 34+ band and/or F+ cups to look through this spreadsheet.

**Are these bras sold in brick and mortar stores?**

If you weren't already aware, the only chain stores in the United States that sells bras beyond the [bra matrix](http://www.venusianglow.com/2008/04/bra-matrix.html) is Nordstrom, Nordstrom Rack, and Dillards.  Nordstrom sells 30+ bands and cups A-J (UK).  However, a majority of the bras they sell do not work well for shallow breasts, and most fitters will not be aware of the limitations that those with shallow breasts face.

Beyond chain stores, the [list of offline retailers from Busty Resources](http://bustyresources.wikia.com/wiki/Offline_retailer) might provide you with a boutique in your area.

**How about online retailers?**

American retailers:

* Nordstrom (free shipping both ways; 30+ bands)
* Amazon (free shipping both ways with Amazon Prime; 28+ bands)
* Zappos (free shipping both ways; 30+ bands)
* BreakoutBras (not especially shallow-bust friendly, but you may find a gem or two; 28+ bands; D+ cups)
* Asos (free shipping both ways; 28+ bands)
* The Little Bra Company (28-38 bands; A-C cups)
* eBay

Non-American retailers:

* Figleaves (only have to pay return shipping to their facility in the US; 28+ bands)
* Brastop (28+ bands; D+ cups)
* eBay.co.uk

**Is there any way that bras that don't generally work for shallow/wide breasts can be made into shallower- and wider-cupped bras?**

This idea is in its infancy, but there are some suggestions that when you go up sister sizes, the cup of the bra becomes a bit wider and shallower.  Several people have considered buying bras that are 3 or more sister sizes larger, then altering them down to the correct band size.  Along these lines, if you find that a bra is just on the cusp of being too narrow and/or too deep, consider going up a sister size.  Caveat: this will work much less often for shorter people, as the straps will be set too wide in the back, and will be much more prone to falling down.  Here is [the blog post that kick-started this idea](http://blog.butterflycollection.ca/2013/04/what-sister-size-bras-look-like.html).  As more people experiment and document this theory, I hope to update this section with more information and links.

I've heard a number of random bra sizes thrown around as ""average"" and have no idea where the source is. So I decided to calculate it myself. I used two datasets.

First, the US Army's Anthropometric Dataset (ANSUR). This is ""fit"" military women (who uh, can do way more pushups than me I'm sure.)

In this dataset, the average underbust measurement was 76.9 cm (median 76.3 cm); average overbust was 90.6 cm. That leads to a ~30in underbust with a 5.2 in difference; or a 30DD or 30E for our imaginary average army woman (who can do lots of pushups). 

The second is the CAESAR dataset, also from the US military, but representing the civilian population (although, ten years ago). In this dataset, the average bust measurement for adult women is 36.6 in and underbust is 30 in - giving us a 30E or F again for our theoretical average woman. 

ANSUR: http://mreed.umtri.umich.edu/mreed/downloads.html
CAESAR: http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA406674

A few caveats to these datasets. First, the measurements were taken standing. So the cup measurements are defs an underestimate, because you should lean over when taking bust measurements. Second caveat -- they're old. ANSUR is from 1988; CAESAR is from 2002, and if you believe the media, humans are getting larger and larger. Third caveat: they're all Americans. EDIT: No they're not -- Italians and Dutch folks too.

Feel free to spout these numbers, criticize my technique, or find a better dataset :-) Mostly, enjoy!

EDIT: Just to be clear -- only the first dataset is military women. The second dataset was performed by the military, but in fact, surveyed the population of three countries at large: ""The Civilian American and European Surface Anthropometry Resource (CAESAR) project was a survey of the civilian populations of three countries: the United States of America (USA), The Netherlands, and Italy (Robinette et al. 1999, Robinette 2000).""
 
Also, for kicks, here's the band size across the population at large: 
""Once you get to the 75th %ile, underbust measurement jumps from 30.6 in to 33.09; 90th %-ile is 36.5 in; 95th %ile is 39.4in. Looking down below, the 10th %ile is 27in, putting them in a 26-band...

I tried that bra on again the night before last to try to get an idea for what alterations overall needed to be done, and felt that the discomfort was so mild I might as well wear it to work the next day to get a *really* good idea. This turned out to be a terrible decision. 

After roughly 9 hours of wear, I experienced:

* **welts and blistering on the backs of my arms**/underarms where they hit the top of the underwire

* **bruising and chafing on the outer edge of my ribs** from the underwire being moved up and down by my arms

* **bruising and discomfort across the top of my belly** because the underwire was being pushed down below my inframammary fold by my arms

* **light chafing at the bottom of the wings, top of the gore, and along the outside of the cup** due to the underwire shifting around so much

* **mild discomfort at the front of my arm pits** against the cup/strap from having to maneuver my arms so awkwardly around the stabbing going on at my sides


Even though I was supposed to meet friends right after work, I postponed for an hour just so I could go home and get this bra off before I bled all over it (this wasn't a realistic concern, but it felt like one at the time). After relaxing bra-free for a while, I thought to take photos of the damage. In the following album, normal bra redness has faded to the point that it is barely visible; the redness you do see is actual damage to my skin that burnt when touched and had bruising under the surface.

They vehemently deny there's anything wrong with taking overbust measurements to size the band, saying it's the 'correct' way and 'underbust' is weird and wrong. 

I've had about three job interviews since being hired at VS and I've not heard back from any of the retailers (all makeup retailers.) 

A little OT but: Not only does our bra knowledge lack and our company keep people in the dark (which is embarrassing for a store that focuses solely on bra sales) but our makeup is garbage and they do not train the employees proper sanitization/application methods. Our 'beauty bar' is a lost cause. It's disgusting.

Does anyone here work at Nordstrom? Do you have any tips on getting hired in the lingerie department? I had two interviews at Nordstrom for cosmetics but I unfortunately didn't get the job. (I'm sure someone more qualified interviewed.)

Thanks for reading. P.P.S. I measure 32 ""overbust"" at VS and a 33"" across the bust - my coworkers swore up and down I was a 32A but I pop out of it in the cup, mostly in the sides.  My underbust is in between 29"" and 30"". Our bra specialist looked at me and said I need a 34A. I wore that size for years and the underwire was constantly sliding up and sitting on my breast tissue. I feel more comfortable in a 30C, but I only own one 30C bra (Betsey Johnson) and own all 32B bras. The band stretches all the way out when I wear a 32B, when I pull on it. I demonstrate this for my coworkers and they don't blink twice. I truly think VS realizes that they are misguiding women and will never change. I also think PINK stopped making bras in 30 bands.

I'm way comfortable in my new bras and have gotten a whole lot of compliments to boot! **Thanks so much!**

As fate would have it, **I'm a roboticist** by training, and I was really upset at how much bras cost. I know something about the state of automation technology, and it seems like **bras shouldn't cost $30-$50** for the ""statistically common"" varieties and way $60+ for the uncommon ones.

If my research is correct, **most bras are still made by hand and require 10-14 hours of shop labor for each one.** That's insane, from both a human rights and a cost perspective! **I think we can do better!**

So I have a potential partner in crime who will be touring factories in China in about two months (for his business in educational robotics) and is going to try to make time to stop by a bra factory and get the details on the latest and greatest. In the meanwhile, **we have some questions:**

1. Bras colors rotate in and out with seasons. Is it important that a bra be ""in season"" colors or will anything do so long as it is ""cute?""
1. We're worried that the lace bits and the robot might not get along because [reasons]. How important are lace bits? 
1. Do you have plain bras to wear under your normal day clothes or around the house in the evening or are these just retired fancy bras?
1. If you could choose, would you rather have MTM (Made to Measure, like http://moderntailor.com and http://indochino.com) bras that fit you absolutely perfectly (in more dimensions than the cup and the band) or cheaper bras in the standard sizes?
1. Are you comfortable enough knowing your size and knowing that the size are consistent to order online? If the bra was MTM would this change anything?

Thanks for helping us make better bras for you!

**tl;dr: I love bras and make robots. I want to make bras with robots. Give me data please.**

Edit: woah! We're super overwhelmed with the response! Your questions made more questions!

1. Heard lots of hate on foam. What are some examples of folks ""doing it wrong?"" Are you saying high-end bras are cloth only? That doesn't seem to be what internet says.
1. ~~How do you ladies know when things are going in and out of season and when the sales are?~~ *Oh, that marketing thing, derp*
1. If you read fashion blogs or other things, which ones? Whose word do you respect on matters of bras?

I'm 16 years old and sort of have a problem with my mother. I live alone with my mom who has really strong opinions about my body and isn't very open minded about trying new things. Ever since I ""got boobs"" (even if they weren't very large) she has been very adamant about the sizes I could wear. Ever since I was thirteen she has forever believed that my bra size is 34A and that it could never be anything different than that or ever change. When she gave me bras they always felt really tight and hurt and basically squished my boobs into oblivion onto my chest. Also, eventhough 28E isn't THAT large a size, it's still a little painful when I don't wear some sort of bra, so I just stuck with it. 

So a few days ago I asked my mother if we could maybe go shopping so I could try on different sizes because of how uncomfortable the ones she gave me were. She sort of then reluctantly agreed to take me some time to Sears (Canada). When she agreed, I got super excited and tried to look for a measuring chart or something so I could figure out what size I was and found this subreddit. Except, I measured exactly half way inbetween a 28E and a 28F. I foolishly went and told my mom about the size I measured and tried showing her the chart that's linked in the side bar buuuuuuut that was a really big mistake. She got angry and yelled at me about how she knows so much more than I do since she's an adult and that with the size I showed her I'm just being ""incredibly overly optimistic"" and that my boobs would never even reach being that size and that the reason she gave me size 34A bras was because she didn't want to hurt my feelings and give me the ""truthful"" size of a 34AA. 

As well, there doesn't seem a way for me to buy bras without my mom because I don't have a credit card to order online, and since bras at specialty boutiques are really expensive, I don't have that much money to go and buy bras (I don't have and am not allowed to get a job).


At this point I just feel incredibly helpless and don't know what to do, but I was hoping that if I made this post maybe someone who knows more about sizing than I do could tell me of a way around it? Is one of the more ""accepted"" sizes maybe compatible with mine (band 32-36, cup AA-D)? I'm sorry if this post was too long or if I'm just wasting your guys's time by reading all of this. I just really don't know what to do :(

Also I'm very sorry if I've made horrible mistakes with grammer or sentence structure or whatever and if this post is hard to read in general. 
Thank you!

**Edit : Thank you, thank you, thank you so much everyone for your comments. They were really sweet and helped a lot! I guess I can try to look for the sister size, but I'm not too sure how well that'll go down. Thank you all again!**

**Edit 2 : Wow, the amount of help and support offers I've gotten is unimaginable, you're all so amazing! There are a bunch of ideas I've seen where I would be able to get proper sizes, but I'm also a little bit worried that if my mother were to see them in the wash she would freak and go crazy about where I got them from ugh.

A-MAZ-ING!

It's really small and kind of hard to find, but they have a good selection and I had a fantastic experience with the fitter. The last time I was fitted was 4-5 years ago, and the dumb lady put me (5'9"", 155 lbs, size 8) in a 36C. So bad, but it felt better than the 34B that Victoria's Secret had put me in before that. It's been probably 3+ years since I last bought a bra, so they were really stretched out and had to be adjusted 50 times a day, plus my ladies grew after going on the pill. After stumbling onto this subreddit I've been absolutely dying to get new bras, but had nightmare experiences at Macys and Nordstrom (sales people refusing to bring me what I asked for from the back because ""there's no way"").

The Eveden fitter eyeballed me at a 32 F and was SPOT ON. I bought three new bras -- 2 Freya and one Fauve -- for $110 (two were $40, one was $30). Their combined retail price would have been $256. I wore one of the Freyas out of the store and left the bra I came in with in the trash. They also carry bathing suits by bra size, and I will most definitely be back when summer starts getting close.

She thinks the new bras are comfy **because** they're from VS and not because they're the right size. I AM SO FRUSTRATED.

And she refuses to swoop and scoop from her back because she says ""How could boobs end up in the back? It's FAT is what it is!""

To which I reply ""Ma, you're a doctor/nurse. What is breast tissue mostly comprised of?""

We got talking about backfat= migrated boob tissue  because only my father and husband are the only people who even believe all this bra-talk when I bring it up. And me and my dad were people watching in the mall (with my mom, though) and remarking on all the bras that didn't fit, and we saw a very fit lady with a lot of backboob. And my mom said it was just her lats coated with lots of fat. Which is unlikely since the girl was toned.

And most of the girls I know have been pretty much humoring me when I was telling them about the bras til I showed them my bra tag, and even then they chalked it to being a UK size. I am so frustrated. GAAAAH

I'm a 32G-GG, currently own only two well fitting bras, and neither one will be allowed to boot camp with me, as they are too delicate and expensive to go through that sort of torture. 

Boot camp means these poor bras will go through the following:

1) Be dumped out of my bag and inspected upon arrival in front of my entire flight. I will be yelled/laughed at if they are frilly, lacy, colorful, etc. Beige, white, and MAYBE black will be okay here, as long as they're minimal.

2) Unceremonious laundering. No hand washing here. They're going to be dumped in the laundry along with everything else, including our huge bulky uniforms. I MIGHT be able to get them on a nice delicate cycle if I get in tight with laundry crew, but it's unlikely. 

3) Chewing out and being thrown out if they show excessively through my clothing. The more invisible, the better. I'll be in a t-shirt or a dress shirt. 

4) Basic training and PT. I'm going to be running, jumping, tumbling, shooting, etc. I will also encounter a gas chamber. 

And this whole thing lasts eight weeks, plus tech school, so they have to survive that long. Depending on how much they cost, I'd be okay with having to retire them after that and buying new ones later. 

They can't all be sports bras (although I imagine most of them will be), because of the dress uniform, which should be tailored to fit my breasts when they're doing normal things, I would think.

After finding MWB's wonderful fitting guide in the sidebar, and finding my true size (38C? Yeah, right, Victoria's Secret... try 34DD and now we're talkin'!), I've gone on a mission -- ALL the ladies in my house need new bras!  
(background: I live with my boyfriend and his family. ""Ladies"" consists of his mom, his younger sister (18) and his older sister (22).)

I started with his mom. Today is my day off, so I'm planning to run some errands, and I like to offer to run errands for the household while I'm out on personal trips. When asked where I was going, I mentioned that before I get a new haircut I'm probably going to pick up a couple new bras, *since my current ones aren't the right size*. (That was the important part; mentioning that opened the door to her curiosity.)

""Not the right size? They look like they fit right to me!"" She asks. So I elaborate a little on how, yeah, it may LOOK like the right size, but only because I'm in too-small cups with a too-big band to compensate. ""But what size are you wearing now?"" 38C. ""And you want to go *bigger*?!""

This is where I start to have fun. I offer to measure her, since I learned the best method from this sub. She measured 38E with moderately snug measurements. The look on her face when I said E... *priceless*. ""What?  I'm not that big! Do they even *make* E cup bras?"" That's when I got to explain how the letter isn't a ""size"" per se, as much as is the *difference* between the two measurements (38C being the same cup volume as a 34DD, hence why it appears to ""fit"" me), and it seemed to click pretty easily.

Bonus: after she and my boyfriend's dad went to run their own errands, the younger sister approached me. She had overheard me measuring her mom and wanted to know if I'd measure her too. The results... 36J. Oh, the fun I'm going to have helping them explore BraStop and FigLeaves...

This ended up kinda long and rambling, but I kinda just wanted to reiterate my appreciation for this community and helping me better understand what a proper fit *really* means. I'm excited and want to share the **True Way** with the world! :)

I found that I was a size 44H. - for most of my adult life I have been wearing something like a 44DD and was skeptical as to this working out. 

I went onto herroom.com and found a fun lacy looking purple bra (I've never had a colorful/lacy/fun/sexy bra ever before) and decided to give it a test go in my new found size which they happily offered, though it was back ordered for a month. I finally got it in the mail and I was little excited, but trying not to get my hopes up incase it really wasn't my size. I tried it on and for the first time in all of my bra wearing years I felt secure while at the same time not feeling like I was wearing much of anything - it was a lovely feeling. I still wanted to give it a proper go around before making up my mind if this really was the one for me or not so my husband suggested we go out to the mall for a walk around. This activity usually made me sore and a bit of a pill by the end of it, but my back and shoulders felt fine - as if I were wearing nothing more than a double layer of shirts! I feel like I could keep on walking or standing without feeling tired and sore for many more hours even!

EDIT: So TIL that being an F or G cup doesn't necessarily mean you have boobs hanging down to your waist. I expected everyone to see my breasts and be like, ""oh yeah, those make Lena Dunham look like a Playmate! No way are you an H!"" So it's been surprising how reassuring everyone is. I do have very unusual breasts, I've never met anyone who looks like me, so it's also a relief to enter into a community of women who are not judging me even though I'm different. I have always wanted breast surgery and had plans for that once I am at a healthy weight again but maybe I won't feel like I need if if the right bra really can improve my shape! 

It might be a little while but I will post an update when I am able to try on some bras.

Gallery of my breasts and two diff bras:
 http://imgur.com/a/DzxIM

Backstory: I have gained a lot of weight recently but have always worn an A and AA cup until recently when my band size got so big they no longer made A cups so I went down in my band and wore Bs. I've always had trouble with gaping cups even in A cups.

I had my first baby 6 months ago. Before baby I weighed 235 and wore a 38 B. I don't remember my underbust but I know my overbust was only 40. After baby I always wore ""Ahh Bra"" type bras because I was breastfeeding and they made it easy. However I think they pushed a lot of fat down onto my ribs because I have weird fatty deposits on my upper ribs that were not there immediately post partum. I was diagnosed with IGT and was not able to successfully breastfeed but mixed fed until diagnosis in January. Shallow breasts like mine are common indicators of IGT. 

My boobs seem to be changing all the time. I mostly don't wear a bra as I am home all the time with baby now and none of mine are comfortable anymore. My left breast is at least a full size larger now but my right one did not change much. You'll see that in the photos.

There are 2 bras in the gallery; my favorite bra from pre-baby size 38B and my only real bra post baby size 40B. 

The 38B bra cuts into my skin. It feels too small. But I love how my cleavage looks in it and how there's no gaping when I lean forward. If I could find a bra that fit better in the armpits but looked like this one in the cleavage I'd be thrilled. I don't ever wear this bra anymore btw, just wanted to show what I like about it.

I hate the 40B bra. It is slightly padded. It looks great in the cleavage when I do the initial scoop but as soon as I move around the cups gape again. They badly gape when I lean forward. The straps slip off my shoulders if I don't cross them in the back. The underwire digs painfully into my armpits. 

I can't find bras in my size in stores so I unfortunately always order online. I moved to a rural part of Australia recently and the only store that sells bras is Target Country and they really don't have much selection. I don't understand Aussie sizing either.

Here's the thing; it's clear to me when looking at my breasts that they are not an H. I can't even properly fill the 40B bra I have. I need help. :( Thank you for any insight!

I was so lost when started nursing and I didn't feel like I got the right help with I went to the motherhood stores. I did finally learned what worked and what I needed, though it was an expensive learning curve. Here are some tips I've learned from my own breastfeeding bra experience:

If you get measured again (which you should because your rib cage will expand) get one cup bigger than what you size at or measure when your breast are at your fullest. When you nurse you breast size will fluctuate 6 to 8 times a day. Buying a slightly large cup give you room for when your breast get full. Also, a bigger cup helps with having a nursing pad in the bra to catch leakage.

You will have to buy a whole new set of bras when your child is between six to eight months old. At six months your rib cage has most likely set back to its original size and the introduction of food to you baby's diet will slow down the nursing. At this stage your breast may even go back to their original size. Though, some woman may not see this until their baby is a year.

You will want at least one underwire with clips, one soft (no wire) with clips, and one cross flap style (no clips). The underwire one is not one you will wear in the beginning. You will want the underwire one for when you go back to work or out to something nice, like dinner. The soft bra with clips is great for in the beginning or just for casual everyday wear. It's still built to support, but it's comfy enough to sleep in. The no clip cross breast style is great for sleeping in/night nursing or when working out. Also, you don't have to fuss with getting the clip back on while have asleep. 


I hope that this is helpful to a woman or two when this time comes into her life and that you won't feel as lost as I was.

I am super small-chested.  I have always just worn a 34A (the smallest I could find in the big chain stores) and although I knew it fit badly, I chalked it up to being too small to need a bra, and that that's the best I'll ever find.  

I had no idea how the sizing ACTUALLY worked, and figured that if A was the smallest, then that's the closest I'll get to a fit.  I thought about buying an AA online sometime, figuring it might fit a little better... because, well, I don't fill out an A!

Started reading r/abrathatfits and wow... I took my measurements.. I'm base: 31"" and bust: 34""   Many of you know that shock, when I discovered I shouldn't even be IN an A bra... but a B or a C! Um, say what? 

I went to my local bra shop... they didn't have a whole lot of options in my size, of course, but the girl found some 32As and 30Bs.  They fit AMAZING!  I love the snug feeling of the band, and wow, they somehow, with minimal padding, make me look like I actually have a chest!   How on earth...??!    Why was I so crazy to wear a 34"" Band all these years? WHO KNEW!?!?!

I liked the feel of the 30B a bit better than the 32A, so I bought two in that size.  I'm thrilled.  My life has been changed! Haha!

So I should say that I am a guy helping out his wife who has severe anxiety (hard to post on forums and things). She had drastic weigh loss as a result of a nerve disorder that stemmed from a c-section and now has almost no breast tissue left.

She looks great now that she is back to a healthy weight, and she is getting treatment for anxiety/depression. Around the house and the neighborhood she wears bralettes, but I can tell she likes a bit of ""help"" when we go out, both for size and shape.

Here is her favorite bralette I found her: [Only Hearts Bralette](http://www.onlyhearts.com/delicious-bralette/)

She is in her late twenties, breastfed 3 kids, and started at a (stated) 34 C. I talked her into letting me measure her when I got a tape for measuring my suits (thanks /r/malefashionadvice).

I finally talked her into trying juniors bras (well actually the nice old lady at Macy's got her to finally try one on, and they fit her great!).

* **TL;DR starts here**
So I am looking for advice from other true AA/A's on bra's that are more grown up than the t-shirt bra below (one of hers).

Measurements (She is NOT a 34, but insists on 34 bands for comfort. and keep in mind I can press my finger into her ribcage from any point on her breasts with very little pressure).

* Height: 5'2""
* Weight: 105lb
* Underbust: 28""
* Standing up Bust: 29""
* Laying Down is also around 29""

Leaning over is impossible, as there is a ton of loose skin hanging down, she used to be about 150lbs and breastfeeding at that weight, now at 105.

Thanks for any help you guys can offer, a tiny bit of self confidence goes a long way for a woman in my wife's position! And what guy doesn't like buying lingerie for his honey?

**EDIT** Damn you guys are helpful, I think the consensus is to try a 30B from the little bra company. Also, thanks for not making me feel weird for asking. If I was not around, I don't think she would shop for clothes at all! Good thing I love shopping (have more shoes than her)...

She was amazed that the gore tacked, the band sit snug, and my boobs weren't mushed in the cup. 

Well, since that, I've been trying to find her a bra that fits. It's been difficult -- I was laid off in June of last year so I've been pretty broke (can't find work either, sigh) and we had a lot of family health issues last year that soaked up cash -- but we ordered when we could, sent them back, and tried again a couple months later, always writing down what she had tried.

Well, a couple weeks ago I took her to Nordstrom Rack where she found a Wacoal bra that fit decently well. She purchased it, even though we both knew it wasn't a PERFECT fit. Still, she wanted a bra that was better than her 38DDs that were shredding and literally falling apart at the seams (I hand washed them for her last time and was shocked when I noticed all the elastic banding coming out). So out she walked with a clearance bra that fit her better than what she had been wearing for 40+ years.

I posted on /r/abrathatfits about the Wacoal and how it fit her. /u/t_maia popped into my thread that night and gave me amazing advice and answered all of my questions wonderfully. That night, we ordered her a 38G Cleo Lucy. The pink and blue one that she had always eyed and loved.

It arrived shortly after Christmas. She excitedly unpacked it, put it on, scooped and swooped like I taught her, and asked me to judge the fit.

It was perfect. 

She was beyond gleeful. She just kept staring at the bra and how well it fit her, raving about how she ""felt no pressure on her shoulders"" and ""she looked so lifted.""

We're hoping finances get a bit easier so she can order more bras to replace the ones that are LITERALLY falling apart, but for the first time in her life, she has a bra that fits. 

So thanks, ABTF. I couldn't have done it without you!

Wish you all a relaxing evening (or morning, depending where you are ""

Now, like this militant brafitting attitude isn't enough for me to take my business elswhere, I will share few more reasons why I think Ewa Michalak bras aren't all that great.

1. Bands
- inconsistent in sizing between models, even inconsistent bands in same model if theye weren't sewn all at once
- those I've tried have too low side wings preventing me from scooping properly and so they actually accentuate back fat

2. Straps too far apart
Yeah, I know, it's my own fault. &gt;.&lt;

3. Cups collapsing
- it could very well be that it's because the straps are too far apart,
But the cups crumble near the wire under the weight of my breasts.

4. Shoulder and back pain
- For some reason, I always get shoulder and back pain after wearing an EM bra for long work day. It's okay only as special occasion bra

5. Top jiggle
I like my boobs heald close to body. EM does the opposite. That leaves my top boob free to jiggle about. Not a fan, don't feel safe in it.

6. Hate padded bras anyway
My boobs don't conform to any given shape. SM is on the way, if it wasn't, I would have canceled the order after this.

7. Crazy fees and shipping costs
We are paying paypal fees seller is supposed to pay, shipping is outrageous and paying extra for special orders.
Oh and no returns if you request electronic invoice!!! Laundering money much?!?!

8. Dominik Michalak
Ewa gave international customer service handling to her brat son who couldn't care less. And that's okay, he doesn't need to. But it would be great if he at least understood english, dealing with international customers and all.

You see, before I ordered the SM I said I hope it won't fit me perfectly because I dislike how they do business there and don't want to order from them again.

Now I just can't stand WHO THEY ARE.

Good night to you, Ewa Michalak, and Godspeed.

My time and money will now be invested in finding another Polish brand we can all transfer to.

[Here is a link to a Google Docs Spreadsheet of all the data analysis I did](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AlBiv70loESMdGNfVWxQcTUyRG1vOTZsSnN6RjJQalE&amp;usp=sharing).  I *highly* encourage you to browse through it.  Here's an explanation of the different tabs and some ways on how to utilize this data:

1. **by user, size**: This is a chart of each user and which bras they specifically have tried on and evaluated.  You can use this tab to find a user that has a size similar to yours, and see what worked for them.  There were many, many bras that fell into a grey area, and I did my best to assign each one to the yes/no binary, depending on the user's comments.

2. **by bra**: This is a chart of simple totals from the first spreadsheet.  Each bra has been counted individually; a positive number indicates how many people fit into the bra, a negative number indicates how many people did not fit in the bra.  This has been sorted from most positive (best reviews) to most negative (worst reviews).  Any bra with a total of 2 or more has been highlighted in green; any bra with a total of -2 or less has been highlighted in red.  Any bra with three or more reviews but had a total of -1 to 1 has been highlighted in yellow.

3. **by brand**: This chart groups all of the bras together by brand.  Note: I did not count daughter companies to be the same as the parent (for example, I counted Cleo as a separate company from Panache).  Any company with a total of 3 or more has been highlighted in green; any company with a total of -3 or less has been highlighted in red.  Another note: of all of the tabs in this spreadsheet, please take this one with the biggest grain of salt.  Any company can make a bunch of ""bad"" bras, but have one bra that works fantastically for people with shallow breasts (for example, b.tempt'd).

4. **by style**: Here I have sorted through each bra and assigned a bra style/shape to each one.  I have five categories: demis (which includes most half cups), three-quarters (which includes most balconettes), full cups, plunges, and strapless bras.  I have tried my best to assign what I feel is the most appropriate style to each bra, and I apologize if there's some bad style choices in there.  Which style I assigned to a bra came from definitions on [Busty Resources](http://bustyresources.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page), tags on [Bratabase](http://www.bratabase.com/), what the bra actually looks like, and (to a much lesser extent) what the manufacturer deemed the bra to be.

5. **by padding type**: Similar to Tab 4, I have assigned an amount of padding to each bra.  Again, I have five categories: unlined (mesh), lightly lined, lined/padded, moulded, and pushup.  If a bra was a pushup bra, that was the category I assigned it to.  Beyond that, a lot of these were a bit subjective, so I tried my best.  Each designation was based off of pictures, reviews, tags on Bratabase, and (to a lesser extent) what the manufacturer deemed it to be.

6. **bras: brand, styles, padding, totals**: This is just a compilation of all the data from tabs 2-5 into one chart.  Feel free to take that information and do your own data analysis on it.  Note: what I specifically did *not* analyze was the correlation (if any) between recommended bras and the bra size.  If someone felt like doing that legwork, I'm sure it would be highly appreciated by everyone in this community.

And now for some actual results!  These conclusions are *solely* based upon the data in the Google Spreadsheet, and I have tried to keep them free of my own biases and anecdotes.

**Which individual bras are recommended:**

* b.tempt'd Ciao Bella
* Lepel Fiore Padded Plunge (note: this bra may not work any longer, due to a slight change in shape in the newer Fiore Plunges)
* Betsey Johnson Eyelet Lace demi
* Cleo Juna
* Calvin Klein Seductive Comfort Customized Lift
* Ewa Michalak HP Bad Girl (discontinued; however, most Ewa Michalak HP bras fit very similarly)
* Freya Carys longline
* Freya Just Flew In padded longline
* Lepel Fiore Padded Balconette
* Natori Feathers contour plunge
* Timpa Duet Lace Underwire Demi

**Which individual bras are *not* recommended:**

* b.tempt'd How Gorgeous
* Cleo Meg
* Freya Deco Half Cup
* Lepel Georgette
* Masquerade Delphi
* Panache Tango II
* Curvy Kate Tease Me

**When picking a random bra from a specific manufacturer, these brands are *most* likely to have a bra that works for women with shallow breasts:**

* Betsey Johnson
* Chantelle
* Ewa Michalak
* Lepel

**When picking a random bra from a specific manufacturer, these brands are *least* likely to have a bra that works for women with shallow breasts:**

* Curvy Kate
* Elle MacPherson
* Freya
* Panache

**Demis and half cup bras are the styles that are most likely to work for someone with shallow breasts.**

**Lightly lined, lined/padded, and moulded bras are most likely to work for someone with shallow breasts.**

**Unlined and pushup bras are *least* likely to work for someone with shallow breasts.**

That's it!  If you would like me to update your entry on Tab 1 (or if you're not on Tab 1 and would like to be), please just PM me with any updates you have!  While I am happy to update Tab 1, I will *not* be propogating those results down through Tabs 2-6.  Google Spreadsheet does not play nicely with filters, tables, and referencing cells in other tabs.

I visited today, doubting I could afford their prices but hoping I could at least try some things on to get a better idea of my size and shape.

Underbust: 30"" loose, 28"" tight
Bust: 41"" standing, 43"" leaning
I think that puts me at somewhere between a UK 30H and a UK 28K depending on which numbers you use.

When I went in, I asked about trying 28 or 30 bands. The ladies gave me a look that said ""there's no way you're a 30"" and came at me with the measuring tape. I was measured under the bust, above the bust and across the fullest part. My fitter then told me I was a 36D, and seemed a little annoyed when I laughed and informed her that the bra I was currently wearing was a UK 32F (which is a bit loose on the tightest hooks and had a significant amount of quad going on). She muttered something about Oprah and went digging in the racks for sizes. She handed me a Panache Tango 32D, a Claudette 34D, and dug around some more until she found a Le MystÃ¨re Dream Tisha 32F (is this a UK 32E?). I put on the 32F and she came to check the fit...about half my boobs were overflowing out and I hadn't even properly swooped and scooped. She was shocked speechless. It was obvious she expected it to be too tight for me to hook and that I wouldn't even come close to filling the cups. After seeing this, she still suggested I try on the 32D and 34D of the other brands but mentioned that I might need an H cup (but failed to tell me if she meant UK, US, European, or Plutonian sizing) and she didn't have any of those.

Tell me about your experiences!,ankylosaurus_rex,58,9,110,http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/1dcpmw/abtf_i_want_to_compile_a_comprehensive_guide_to/,"Basically, I'd like to make a guide for shallow breasts.  The one in the sidebar is a good start, but it kind of stops around the buying bras part.  Ideally, I will compile all of the information you all supply, arrange it in a logical order, and make another post here with it all in there.

So what am I looking for?  Anything and everything!  Some examples:

* How did you realize that you had shallow breasts? (I am especially interested in the answer to this question if you have a bra size that's generally considered to be outside the usual shallow breast range.)

* When you're bra shopping, what do you look for?

* What bras do you love?

* What bras do you hate?

* Which brands work well for you, and which never work for you?

* How do you prefer the cups of your bra: unlined, lightly lined, or moulded?

* Tell me about how you deviate (if at all) from any general guidelines for shallow breasts, but you definitely have shallow breasts.

* What have been your experiences with professional fitters?  Have your shallow breasts stumped/confused fitters?

* How do your underbust measurements (both snug and break-the-tape) compare to the band size you find that works best?  Do you have much ""padding"" on your ribs?

* Point me towards any other blog posts/websites that have helped you in your journey.

* State any questions you would love to have answered.

Feel free to answer any, some, none of those questions.  Make up your own questions!  Answer someone else's questions! I just want to hear all of your experiences, and put it in one logical, comprehensive guide.  If it's something you'd tell to someone else who has shallow breasts, I want to know it.  Thank you!

I've settled for 30 bands but several companies that make smaller 30 bands don't make larger cups and Nordstrom always seems to carry Freya one size larger then I need. I usually have one or two almost ok fitting bras to choose from in my size and they're $89 to boot. I own a lot of 32DDs which fit surprisingly ok for the most part, it's not perfect but it's much better then the 34Bs I was wearing originally. Still, I haven't given up. This weekend I drove 45 minutes and hit up a bunch of bra stores, pickings were slim but I managed to find a 30DDD/E by Natori that fit me better then anything I'd previously tried on at Nordstrom but I had one more store to hit up. 



I'd saved the best for last of course, I knew Intimacy was pricey but at this point it seemed worth it to actually have options. When the saleswoman asked for my size I mentioned I was probably a 30E but would need a 30F in Simone Perele since my 30E is too small and the wires dig in. Without measuring me, the saleswoman said I was a 30D. I was embarrassed but agreed to try it on, figuring it would be apparent how awful the fit would be and then I could try on my size, she was the expert after all. She insisted the 30D was my size, adjusted the straps so the obvious quadboob and spillage wasn't awful and declared it a perfect fit. She insisted my breast tissue outside the cup was supposed to be there. I pointed out the  much larger bra I was wearing wasn't gapping. When I mentioned the issues I had with smaller bras she said I was choosing the wrong style. She lead me to the 30Ds and instructed me to choose some. At that point I left. I have been sized incorrectly, sometimes on purpose, but I have never been treated so dismissively. Even Victoria Secret put me in a better fitting cup, and it's a lot cheaper then $108. I left feeling completely terrible (I know my boobs aren't massive but having my naked chest stared at and then told how I was wrong and they were much smaller then I thought they were made me really self-conscious) now I'm just angry, no one should be treated like that and I've been recommending them to people!

After some initial struggling, I found a boutique shop that fitted me at 30E (a vast improvement).  As my breasts grew and changed shape, I went back again and again to boutique bra shops, who consistently fit me somewhere in the 30 E-G range.  I've lectured friends and family about getting properly fitted, and I've dropped hundreds (thousands?) of dollars on professionally fitted bras.

Yet my professionally-fitted bras never quite fit the way all the ""how your bra should fit"" guides said.  They rode up a little in the back, and within weeks I would be wearing them on the smallest hook.  They dug into my sides, where my breast tissue spilled out behind the cup.  They dug into my breastbone, yet I could shove a whole fist under the band.  I'd go to the boutique stores, who would hem and haw and bring out more complex breast-holding contraptions and fiddle with straps until I was convinced it was ""good enough"".  At home, though, the bras never seemed to fit right, and would continue to cause pinching, bruising and back pain.

I measured myself at home, and found my underbust was 28 inches.  I measured again, still 28.  I waited a few weeks, got a friend to measure me - 27.5.  Another few weeks, and a different friend, 28.5.

Today I walked into a different boutique, in a different city and asked them to try on a 28G bra.  For the first time, I found myself wearing a bra that did not ride up in the back.  I can't fit more than a few fingers under the band, and ALL of my breast tissue fits in the cup, instead of some squishing out behind the cups, and I found a molded cup bra that actually sits right.  I ended up buying that one, and another one in the same size. I don't know yet whether this will resolve the back pain issues, but there's no pinching or riding, and for the first time ever, I'm not desperate to take my bra off as soon as I'm in the house.

It went horribly! I'm not easily intimidated but seriously got upset at the whole experience. I planned to go in 'browse' and try some things myself and see how it went. It didn't quite work out like that. I got lynched with a pushy sales lady the second I walked in. She informed me that everyone MUST start with a measurement. I didn't really want this but relented thinking MAYBE she'll be able to help me better after taking it. So she comes into the change room with me and proceeds to measure me OVER my bra (crappy fitting btw) and over my shirt. I'm not impressed at this point. She now 'knows what size I am' and is only bringing what she thinks I should be in instead of the sizes I've asked for. I tried a few and when they fit HORRIBLY and she was insisting the fit GREAT! I walked out. I called hubbie from the parking lot and he encouraged me to go back in and try again. Clearly expressing that I didn't want help. Great in theory but after I get in there again I find that none of the racks are labeled for non employees to easily find anything so I have to ask someone else what area I need for my size. And that was it now I have employee #2 latch on and start pressuring me about my size and what I should be wearing. fyi my measurements are: Around my rib is 32.5"" and around my bust is 45"" Standing bust: 42"" Laying on back: 43 &amp; 1/4""

So I dig my heals in and insist on trying on certain sizes and she starts lecturing me about how it's bad for the small bras to be tried on by 'someone so large' she kept going on and on but did eventually get me a few. They did not have anything that ended up fitting (or if they did she didn't bring it to me) all in all it was 0 fun and I feel bad for anyone who goes into that shop... and I'm back to attempting this via internet ordering. :( heheh I did have one chuckle when she was telling me that one bra fit wonderfully... lol the gore was sticking out at least an inch from my sternum.

I measured myself using the guide in the sidebar, checked my breast shape, and read so many of your stories.  I calculated about a 28G (US).  I though, ""There's *no way* I'm a G"".  I've been stuffed into a 34B my whole life and now these women are trying to tell me I'm a G?!  Being of small breasteses, I was ridiculed about my flat chestedness by boys and girls in school and constantly told myself that I was a B cup and I'd never be anything else.  I've wanted implants since I was 17 so that I'd be more proportional, but have never gotten the guts to go under the knife.

I've had bras ride up on my boobs, straps that ride up my back, underwires dig into and painfully rub skin off of my armpit pudge (definitely migrated tissue), and 16 years of crying and frustration when I went bra shopping.  

You ladies inspired me.  I've only been doing my research for a day and I already went to Dillard's, stood firm on my measurements at the *obvious* frustration of the saleslady, and bought myself a b.tempt'd 30DDD in UK (it was the only one that came close to my starter recommendation of 28G in US size).  I couldn't live with what my previous bras were doing to my body and I gotta tell you ladies...you were 100% RIGHT about EVERYTHING!!!

I was so happy I cried on the drive home!  Finally a bra that fits comfortably, stays PUT, and encompasses all of my breast tissue.  It feels like soft little hands coddling my lady lumps.  I have to admit, I could go up another cup since there's a little quadding, but I'll be damned if I didn't feel like the boob goddesses weren't shining down on me today.  I even got it on sale for $10!!

So thank you ladies of ABTF.  Thank you a billion times!  You've kickstarted my journey on well educated, decisive, and tearless bra fittings.  

As a side note, I even converted my saleslady today.  She is a true believer now and said she'd get online and research everything she could about proper bra sizing.

I also mentioned on Twitter that I sent in the email. I got a reply by both email and on Twitter. I've been told it would be passed on to the right people. It's maybe hopeful but it would be great if more places listened and did sizing advice properly.

My email:
&gt;I'd like to note that your recommended method for sizing oneself for bras is severely outdated and sort of wrong. The add 4 or 5 inches does not lead to a well fitting bra and is one of the things that leads to the vast majority of women wearing far too large of band sizes and far too small of cups.

&gt;Example: In your video, the woman sizing herself ended up putting herself into a 34B. Based on her measurements, she'd be better off with something closer to a 28D or 30C (which one ends up fitting will seem to depend on a few factors that are hard to tell based on a clothed measurements. I've been often advised to just try on sizes to find out but to use the measurements as a base).

&gt;In other examples, I personally am between a 30GG and 32G depending on the bra design. (UK sizing, how it's referred to in US sizing seems to vary between between F and I depending on the chart), with a below chest measurement of about 33 and a bust measurement between 39 and 40, depending on time of day. It's what I was sized into based on in person trying of bras. For some reason the 38B your sizing would suggest seems unlikely (or even if I double added because my number difference reflects that my band would still be smaller than the bust still makes me feel a 38D is about as unlikely).

&gt;I know you need to have a size guide and so can't just advise a sizing at a reputable lingerie place, but I do suggest no longer recommending the +4/+5 band method.

I can't. Like, this woman is a professional seamstresses. She works with clothes for a living. It is her job to understand how clothes fit. Yet as soon as I tried to explain to her how difficult it is for me to find bras, she stares at me like I've lost my mind.

I told her today that I wanted to try learning to make my own bras, because they're so hard to find in stores here, and I just can't keep spending my money on them the way I have been. At first, she asks me if I had tried looking at *training bras*! Like, I get that I'm really thin and petite, but damn woman, I have breasts! And I was wearing a really tight fitting shirt with *horizontal stripes* for goodness sake. There was no hiding that I have some decently large breasts.

So when I told her that no, those won't work for me, because they aren't big enough, she responds ""No I mean like those trainer bras for teenagers. They have some really cute ones at Sears."" Like [this](http://www.sears.com/joe-boxer-women-s-seamless-bralette/p-018VA54839412P?prdNo=38&amp;blockNo=38&amp;blockType=G38). That's the kind of bra she thought I needed. I seriously can't.

So I tell her that no, that wouldn't work, and I actually need about a 30F/28G (I use US sizes with her just so I don't have to explain the UK sizing method to her. I know her head would explode if I said FF), and she says ""They don't make a G!"" I just...I can't.

But oh, it gets even better guys. She actually mentioned to me that she was altering a bra for one woman, because ""Apparently it's a really nice one, and she just had a baby, so she lost a lot of weight, and needs it taken in."" So, of course, I get curious, and I check the tag on it. 34G guys. It's a Chantelle 34G. Not five minutes earlier, the woman tasked with altering this bra told me ""They don't make a G!"" And I measured the band (with the amount of length the woman wanted taken out pinned back) and it was 30"". So if this woman was a 34G in US sizes, and she needed the band taken down to 30"", this means this woman needs a 30G (UK sizing). Yet when I told my sewing teacher that I was a 28G (so a 28F, not that far off from a 30G) she acted like I was an insane person. And then when I showed her that the bra was a 34G, she said ""Wait, a G is big? I thought a G was small. You can't be a G. This is too big for you.""

So I tried explaining to her about how the cup size was relative to the band, like how a 32DD was very different from a 38DD, but she seemed to be pretty lost. I was tempted to try on that woman's bra, just to show her how close it actually was, but I didn't get the chance.

They claim to carry cup sizes AA - KK and band sizes 28 - 54 with over 50 different brands. I was there shopping for 28E bras, and I can say they definitely had a decent selection for my size. I was pleased to see that they carried brands like Freya, Panache, and Curvy Kate, which I can't usually find in stores in the US. I wasn't fitted by an employee but my sister was. The ladies working there were definitely proper fitters, and even taught her to swoop and scoop. 

Unfortunately that's where the good ends. As soon as I got into my dressing room I noticed how jacked up all the prices were. I do a lot of looking around online for bras in places like figleaves, herroom, barenecessities, etc., so I have a pretty good idea of what certain bras usually cost. For example, Zoe and Co. was selling the Curvy Kate smoothie bra for $90. This bra usually costs $65 to $70 everywhere I've seen it. Zoe and Co. does not have a sale rack either, and they do not typically run sales, so if you go there be prepared to spend a lot. (Disclaimer: Not trying to say they have no right to increase their prices, just warning people who don't have a lot of money.)

And now for the horrible customer service. While the girl helping out my sister seemed nice enough, the woman helping me was extremely rude. First she barged into my dressing room without asking if I was dressed and got an eyefull of me completely topless. No bra, nothing at all. And she totally swung the curtains open enough for anyone else standing there to see the goods too. That by itself wouldn't have been a big deal for me, but it gets worse. She asked me where I usually buy my bras, and I told her that I've only bought them online which was hit or miss for me, and then I explained that I drove an hour and a half to get to Zoe and Co. so I could try on bras in person. She immediately accused me of coming into the store with no intention to actually buy bras, just to try them on. She then proceeded to lecture me about how their fitting room was for paying customers only, not for people just wanted to try bras and then buy them online. 

At this point I was very angry because I came into that store with every intention to buy a bra or two, and here is an employee berating me in a dressing room while I helplessly stand there in just a bra. At that point I didn't even want to buy a bra there because she was so rude to me, but of course I felt obligated at that point because if I walked out without a bra I would be proving her right. I explained to her that she had misunderstood me, I did not intend to just use their fitting room and then buy all the bras online, etc. She didn't apologize, only said ""I didn't mean to call you out."" Call me out on what, something that I'm not even planning to do? So rude.

She continued to be rude all the way through checkout, told me I couldn't possibly know anything about bra fitting from the internet because I'm not a ""trained professional"" like her. Belittling a customer as she forks over money for your overpriced bra that you guilted her into buying? Not cool. I don't ever plan to return to this store and I don't recommend it to anyone else either. Unless you're loaded and want to pay $80 for $60 Freya bras. They do have a good selection and proper fitting techniques, but I walked out of there feeling angry and frustrated about how I was treated.

A couple weeks ago, a posting went up for a 70J CHP Mak, and I immediately jumped on it, as it was a sister size of what I'd estimated to be my size, so I figured I'd wear it with an extender and it should give me a good starting point.  After reserving this bra, the seller let me know she might have another one of the same size (the SM Trefl) posted the following week - I let her know I'd be interested and asked if she could hold this bra to combine the shipping.

I had to break out and tell people who might actually care! This is going to get overly long, and nobody really wants to read a novel with a short punch line, but I'm too happy to care! 


Some background: like most people, I was a Victoria's Secret shopper. I bought their 34DDs all the time up until I had my daughter. They weren't perfect, but they got the job done. I knew they weren't quite right, but I could make do for the price and convenience. Then I got pregnant... and my ladies blew up like water balloons. It only got worse with nursing. My band size got up to 44ish while pregnant, and afterward my milk came in and I settled in around a 40H (this by poor-fitting Motherhood Maternity nursing bra standards). Regardless of true/proper sizing standards, suffice to say my girls got HUGE overnight.


Fast-forward two years, and I've lost the 70 pounds I gained while pregnant (ok, most of it), I'm broke, and I badly need new bras. For a very long time I've been stuck limping along in my old VS bras, despite poor fit, age, and the fact they are literally coming apart in my hands as I put them on. I finally sucked it up, saved some money, and... this brings my rambling post to the point.


Three weeks ago I had the worst, most awkward ""professional"" fitting in my entire life at a southeastern Wisconsin boutique called ""Allure."" Word to the wise, locals - don't waste your time. The store manager put me in a 34D, gave me some spiel about improving the angle of the bottom of my breast, and only grudgingly let me try on a 34DD. It involved being manhandled by a stranger who didn't know her ass from her face. Needless to say, I left angry and empty-handed. 


This past Saturday, my sister, my cousin, and I drove 90 MILES to the nearest Nordstrom (Woodfield Mall, Schaumberg, IL) so we could try on ""real"" bras. I got two more awful fittings there... both tried putting me in 34DDs. One told me, ""Your ribcage measures 31. You have to add 3, so your size is a 34."" I rolled my eyes said, ""Don't bother bringing any, I'll do my own shopping."" I've measured myself recently... at a 33 (turns out I was wrong).


Then I met Henrietta. She's AWESOME. Locals - go see her. Seriously. I tied on about 50 bras on my own before she finally came to check on us. I had tried on every 32DDD/32E in the store and was getting super frustrated. I felt like I was ""this close"" to getting it right. She listens to my story about the bad fittings, re-measures me and says, ""honey, you're a 30.""


Eureka! Turns out, I'm a 30FF, or thereabouts. Who knew?? There weren't many in the store, and since each brand runs differently...etc. The Cleo 30s wouldn't even reach all the way around. Fantasie closes but is too tight. Freya is just right. I suspect I might find a few 32F/32FF that are equally just right, but that will be a trip for another day. 


I seriously could have hugged Henrietta. Instead, I'll do the next best thing: call her manager to give her a rave review, and tell everyone who will listen to go to her. 


In the end, I walked out with only one bra (Freya Patsy half-cup), but I have a place to start so I can stop wasting my time!


I'M SO HAPPY I COULD HUG EVERYONE!!!

My friend is a skinny skinny girl, and when I first began my bra journey I was telling her all about bras and she told me she's wearing a 36B (down from a 38 when she was a little heavier).  I told her no way, and had her measure herself.  She told me she was right, she was a 36B and I left it at that (I wasn't there to see and she didn't tell me her measurements). 

So fastforward to today and she's at my house and I showed her a bra I was packaging up for a swap.  I asked her to measure again just for fun..  Her underbust really is a 35, all of it rib so a 34 would probably be uncomfortable unless it's really stretchy.  Her overbust was about a 38.  So rounding up to the 36.. she's actually pretty much in the right size, and her current Kohl's bra looked to be fitting well, though the band may have been riding up juuuuust a little.  

I did tell her to try a 34C just to see next time she's bra shopping and informed her a stretchy 34C would probably fit a littttle better.. but.. I'm amazed.  I still can't believe it even though I saw it myself, because she really is so tiny everywhere else.

After seeing mywifesbusty's guide on bestof reddit several months ago, I convinced her to give measuring a go. Now, keep in mind that she is not large chested. She has always worn a size 36 to 38B. her measurements came out as 42 inch around the bust, 35.5 inch ribcage. The calculator came out as a 36 DDD/E. Obviously she reacted with ""that's way too huge, you have no idea what you are talking about"". I dident seem concerned because I have noticed that many people here have started with pretty small sizes and have had dramatic changes in some sort of band/cup combination. We decided to go look at bras. Being in Canada (please correct me if i am wrong) we are pretty much limited to la senza and Victoria secret as the providers of higher quality bras. After looking in VS, her usual size (38b) seemed to fit her reasonably well. The 36 DDD she supposedly measured in as using the guide on the sidebar was waaaaaaaaaaay too big for her. Like so big that it would have been a joke to try it on. Boy did i feel like an idiot... So my question is this: everybody here complains about VS. is it because they are making bras that are way off in the sizes they are supposed to be? Or is the fitting guide on the sidebar wrong? Did I somehow measure her incorrectly? What are we doing wrong here?

**BACKGROUND**

To give all the new subscribers a bit of background, I was wearing a Victoria's Secret 34C wireless bra when I began my bra journey. I was always measured this way at Victoria's Secret and accepted it as the truth. I had never gone elsewhere because of availability, distance, and frankly, I didn't realize my bra didn't fit.

Right before MyWifesBusty's post made the front page, I had just bought 2 brand new Body by Victoria wireless bras. They felt so comfortable, but occassionally my boobs themselves would feel a bit sore. I blew it off as time of the month nonsense and went on.

Then MWB's post made the front page. My first measurement put me in a 32F. My mind was blown, but I ordered a pretty, lacey Lepel bra anyway. 

When it came in, I was skeptical. I hated wires -- they always dug into my breasts and poked me. Still, I put the new bra on. ""God these cups are HUGE!"" I thought as I slid it on, scooping and swooping. I stood up and to my amazement, the band sat flat on my chest and my boobs were sitting in the cups, rather than being mashed into them. 

However, I didn't fill out the cups. Like... at all. They were a wrinkly mess, so I hopped here for guidance and re-measured. New measurement: 29.5"" underbust, so I went with a 30E. I kept my first 30E bra -- a Freya Jolie -- and figured it fit, but when I looked down, I could see the breast tissue kind of poking out of the top on my largest side (meaning the lace cup was ""cutting"" into my breast tissue at the top, indicative of a too-small cup). I reluctantly tried a 30FF Curvy Kate and 30F Freya. Amusingly, the 30FF CK fit better, but I still was experiencing issues with my breast tissue at the top of the cups. Even worse, the 30F Freya padded cup bra was too damn big.

This is about when I began researching wide and narrow wires, since the concept didn't make much sense to me and breast tissue width was foreign to me. Pictures like [this](http://www.flickr.com/photos/86507214@N02/7925225398/in/photostream) (Freya) and [this](http://www.investinyourchest.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Becky-Romance-close.jpg) (Curvy Kate) from the blog Invest in Your Chest really helped visualize the difference for me.

I determined I needed narrow wires, since my tissue did not come far over beneath my arms and I was not shallow on the tops of my breasts. I had severe asymmetry (my left side, like many women, is nearly 1 cup size larger than my right). I also really liked the lift that the Ewa Michalak styles seemed to provide and really wanted to try the brand that so many women boasted about.

**PLANNING THE ORDER**

I had a couple things to consider. First, the asymmetry -- I needed a bra that would fill in my uneven side and do it well, without weird cup shaping. I also needed a style that wouldn't gap at the top like it was going out of style (my Freya Decos are AWFUL about this, but if I go down a cup size further, it's too small -- go figure). 

A lovely lady on Bratabase suggested the half-cup styles from Ewa Michalak over the plunge styles due to all of this, so I narrowed down my search to the bras available with padding and half-cup styles. [For the curious, these are ALL the Ewa bras with padding to compensate for asymmetry.](http://www.ewa-michalak.pl/eng_m_Bras_Push-Up-Bras-141.html)

Once I figured out what I had to choose from, I had to tackle the different abbreviations as well as the sizing guide. Since I can't speak Polish, here's what I learned.

**--ABBREVIATIONS**

* The blogger [Curvy Wordy](http://www.curvywordy.com/2011/12/understanding-different-ewa-michalak.html) has a fabulous general guide to most of the available styles of Ewa bras. This is the go-to to get most people started with Ewa bras.
* If your breasts are shallow (tissue spread over a larger area, base is wider, projection smaller), you may want to try HP bras. These bras have more of a minimizing effect, pressing the tissue down into the chest and lifting it. Some women also have issues with the HP bras ""gapping"" on the sides.
* If your breasts are more ""deep,"" (smaller base, more projection of tissue -- these are my breasts) a CH bra is more of the way to go, from what I know. This means you have more tissue at the bottom. Round shaped breasts seem to do very well with these cuts. The higher gore will also give you support and stability.
* Plunge styles have a lower gore, if being poked in the sternum is a big issue for you. However, I've heard the bands run tight while the cups can run large.
* If you don't have bottom-heavy boobs and find you are fuller on top, try an HP bra.
* If you want a true, unlined, unpadded bra, try the HM styles. Most find they run generous in the cups though.

**--SIZING**

* When sizing for an Ewa bra, do not use the calculator. It is a crapshoot that often spits out the wrong size. Instead, do this: Take your EU measurement (for me, a 30F). Now, figure out your band size in Ewa sizing. For me, this is a 65 band. *Keep in mind that you do NOT want to go smaller, in my experience, for 32 and below bands. They run very tight. In fact, my 65F measures in at 23"" unstretched (new) and 29"" stretched. It will be tighter than most of your Freya/Curvy Kate bras.* Because of this, if you're a 29"", don't try a 28"" (60) band. Go with a 65 or potentially even a 70 and keep the band size, down a cup guidelines in mind.
* Now that you have your band size, find that band size on the [**CHART**](http://www.ewa-michalak.pl/Size-Calculator-chelp-eng-10.html). It will be the numerical value on the left side. Now you must figure out your breast tissue volume. 
* Ewa measures breast tissue volume like MWB's guide -- leaning over. So take your leaned-over measurement and convert it to centimeters. If you have pendulous breasts, average the standing and bent-over measurements. I personally averaged my standing and bent-over measurements, even though my breasts aren't particularly pendulous. What you decide is up to you.
* Now take that measurement and find it along the band size. For example, for 34"", you'll look for the measurement closest to 86.36cm. This would be a D (85cm) or a DD (86.5). I did this and came up with my usual measurement: 30F. 

**ORDERING**

With my size in mind as well as the styles, I ordered a 30F as well as a 30FF in the [CH Biszkopty ""Biscuit""](http://www.ewa-michalak.pl/product-eng-259-CH-Biszkopty.html). I also ordered the matching bottoms.

Ordering was fairly painless, though the pay system can seem a bit confusing. For me, I placed my order and then went into my email to pay it via PayPal. However, I believe it does prompt you at check-out whether you want to pay now or later. You have 14 days to complete payment.

As soon as I paid, it was shipped out within the next business day. I received it within roughly ~8 business days (I live in the mid-US). I had to sign to receive it.

The bra was shipped well and all the paperwork was stapled together so it wasn't a disaster to keep in case of return. I tried on both bras with the padding and found that the 30F fit me best. 

Returning was a bit confusing -- you have 10 days from your receive date to return the bras. I contacted their CS and they sent me the PDF file for the return sheet. I filled it out, placed a NEW order on the site for my exhange items, and sent in an exchange for a CHP Mak in a 30F as well as a smaller bottoms for the Biszkopty.

Within roughly 2 weeks time, Ewa contacted me to say that they were shipping out the new order. I received it, once again, within roughly 8 days. 

Overall, I'm extraordinarily happy with my Ewa bras and will continue to order more. The lift is amazing, the shape is gorgeous, and the construction is top-notch in my opinion. Even without the padding on my bad side, the gapping isn't too accentuated, and I will just take the oomph out of my other bra and put it into the Mak. I also might buy a small extender to wear with my Ewa bras for the first few weeks wear, since they are very tight. However, I do not want to go up a band size (though I probably could) since they do stretch out a bit and fit me even better after that.

Hope that helps someone considering buying an Ewa bra! If you have any questions, I will answer to the best of my ability.",,False,,t5_2s8kf,1355512278.0,,,True,t3_13je8d,http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/13je8d/considering_ordering_from_ewa_michalak_and_dont/,

And, with this breast shape, it's honestly pretty hard to determine that anyway. I'm also open to the idea that via this discussion, we'll discover that conical and tubular are two different things. 

It's been noted that the leaning measurement overestimates cup size for conical/tubular shapes. My leaning measurement would put me in a 30H, while I am actually a 30FF/G depending on brand.

So, what's been your experience, other conical gals of reddit? Describe your breast shape, describe what bras work for you and don't work, and how your measurements translated to your actual size. Let's pool knowledge and then maybe get this added to the sidebar!

I did this as recently, I've been suspecting some issues are specific to this size range. So far, here are my results, in graph form

http://imgur.com/a/CnRSe

What I suspected is turning out to be correct. Ladies with H+ cups in any band size need tight bands. Many people commenting need their BTT or snug measurement, even ladies without much squish, for the shape of their breasts. Breasts in this size range are heavy, and without a bra that is firm, will not be supported.

It also became apparent that the recent strap issue that was highlighted to Ewa Michalak is common across the board with these sizes. Companies are not grading their patterns down, and this is causing major issues in this size range. Particularly being the straps are so wide they start off our shoulders! Ewa Michalak suggested we go up a bandsize to accomodate for this, but as seen above, women in this size range need supertight bands! If not we'd be uncomfortable

Breasts also tended to be narrow and full on top with a lot of projection in this size range. This isn't surprising, as when you think about it, small breasts tend to be shallow and wide, so boobs at the other end of the spectrum would make sense to be narrow and to be projected. There seems to be a massive tendency to be full on top, which I've also suspected is common in this size range. 

I'll be making a post soon about how to fit H+ and common issues, and I will be writing to several bra manufacturers showing them this. However I would love it if I could get some more replies first.

I (28E-F) laughed, and said that I couldn't imagine having *really* big boobs either, but cup size is all relative, so tons of people who you don't think of as having ""big boobs"" are wearing cup sizes in the DD+ range.

She nodded in a way that indicated agreement, but then kept talking about how giant DD boobs were.

I've recently lost as much as 45 pounds, so I decided to take a re-measure, as I noticed that something funky was going on there. I've been a reader here, but have been reluctant to ask for help without the measurements, and reluctant to TAKE the measurements before I was done losing weight so fast. Well, I seem to have plateued, so here's a bit more backstory before I provide those delicious measurings. 

Anyways... Wearing a 40D has always been fine, but not correct. I'd always have to wear the shoulder straps at the smallest possible size, and even then they'd be a little... Off. But now it's just a disaster. The strap is too big, the cups are like... Fucking huge, my boobs slip put the bottom, and sometimes at night, they wander off and kill people.

So... I'm still unsure about what a shallow/deep root is, but I can tell you that they're pretty far apart, and they're really very pendulous.

SO! My results are as follows:

Underbust loose: 37""

Underbust tight: 34""

Bust : 43.5""

Bust leaning: 44""

Bust laying: 43""

And the calculations reveal.... 34GG!

The fuck ladies!? I'm confused. I'm scared, and I'm hiding in the corner cradling my poor bosoms in my hands weeping.

Why is the band so small? Why are the cups so huge? Now I have no idea, my current bra feels like shite, There's no way I can afford a quality bra (or any bra, for that matter. I am just squeaking by as is). Gonna go freak out now.

I was apprehensive about it, but I just tried the wireless '[Deco soft cup](http://www.bravissimo.com/products/lingerie/everyday-essentials/deco-soft-cup-bra/black/fy121blk/)' and it fits *so* much better. The shape isn't as uplifted--it's nice and rounded, but at a slightly more natural level. The cleavage is intense, and support and comfort definitely aren't compromised by the lack of wires. And--bonus--the band is much snugger than the Deco plunge, much more akin to what one would expect from a 28. For reference,  I normally wear 28FF (occasionally G) in Freya; my Deco plunge is a slightly-too-big 28FF that I have to wear on the tightest hook, and the wireless fits well in a 28FF.

I think she just picked a number close to what I was already wearing, or else believed like I did that a girl my weight had to be a smaller size. I assumed I was buying the wrong shape then because my boobs were always falling out of the cup. I knew I was not an A cup, but I didn't fill out a C cup.

Well, that's because I am apparently supposed in a 28  band, which I didn't even know existed. I just had to accept that the back of the bra **does not** belong three inches higher than the front. So that puts me at the ""G/H/J"" range (and maybe bigger...I could get the band down to 26, but it left a mark, so it's 28, right?).

We're on the larger side, and in the deep south, so finding stores that cater to our sizes is almost impossible. LB is the best we can do if we want to try before we buy. 

The employees were very friendly and sweet. When they saw we were looking at the bras, one woman offered to do a sizing. I politely declined, and we went about our merry way. About halfway through our visit, the same employee stopped me as I was getting another armload of bras to try.

She had seen some of the rejected sizes we put on the return rack, and asked me why my mom was trying on G and H cups. I told her that actually, those were for me. I explained that we had sized ourselves according to a very reliable guide and had done our research, and really, should be in an I/J probably rather than a G/H. She looked absolutely shocked. She said, ""no, honey. You just aren't that big,"" and then offered again to size me. I asked how they measure for sizing, and she showed me on herself. Around the underbust, then the overbust, then subtract. I told her that's basically what I did, and the bras were working out just fine. She tried her best not to look thoroughly skeptical. 

Later, I heard her sizing a younger girl in the next dressing room. I could tell at a glance that the bras the girl ended up buying were FAR too small in the cup. I was sad for the girl because this is the beginning of a long, uncomfortable journey for her. Furthermore, when the employee turned around, I was aghast at the sheer amount of bulging that was going on under her own sweater. Seriously, this woman was wearing a *radically* ill-fitting bra. Anyway, I'm not one to judge and I'm not particularly angry over my experience or anything, but there really should be a class on this stuff that lingerie store employees must take before offering sizing services to the general public. I mean how has this situation NOT been remedied yet? That's basically half of the population walking around uncomfortable because we're so embarrassed about our breasts that we can't even talk about this stuff, or learn it in health class along with periods and puberty or something? It's unbelievable.

A different employee checked us out at the end of our spree. She peeked at a tag on one of my bras and said ""wow"" OUT LOUD, right in front of my mom and me. I wasn't mad about that either, honestly. I know my boobs are glorious. I also know that I probably would have reacted the same way a few months ago. 

It was uncomfortable to have a store employee stop me to ask about my [mom's] bra size. I know she was trying to be helpful. She's probably frustrated that she couldn't help us get into the ""correct"" size. But honestly, did she...think we were going to buy these enormous cup sizes to impress a couple of LB employees? That we're walking around wearing comically huge, gaping cups? Anyway, I just wanted to get all this off my chest (harharhar) to some people who would understand.

I lamented my small boobies, wishing for cleavage or some hint of sexiness. I hated that I was always tugging at and adjusting my bras throughout the day, so uncomfortable.

Shopping for the perfect bra for me has still been a struggle (I really wish I could try things on before ordering them online), but I am getting closer and each one feels better and better.   

It's sad to see so many women uncomfortable and blaming their bodies as being ""weird"" when really it's the problem of bra manufacturers and retailers for not catering to anything but a very limited range of sizes and mis-sizing so many women!

Of course the first order of business will be finishing university (all this debt has to lead to something good in the end, right?), but once I graduate and have the funds to do so, I really want to open my own bra shop to help spread the word about the right sizing methods, and what a big difference wearing the right size can make. I want people to know that sizes larger than DD and bands under 32 are not weird sizes. I want women to be comfortable and feel pretty in their bras. I want bra shopping to be a positive experience!

I've always thought my wife doesn't give herself enough credit as far as her boobs go and I've always suspected she wears the wrong size.  She won't have any of it though.   I'd like to help her but it's very touchy subject.

Some background...   We're both big people, and she's probably more self-aware about it than I am.  She's only 4'11 and also does have fairly small boobs which she despises with a passion.  She'll regularly complain that how can she big a big girl and not get the boobs like every other big girl. =p   She's convinced she's just an A cup, but I don't buy it.  She does have shallow pointy boobs, but when I squeeze them there's a lot more there than she likes to believe.

After reading all the stuff from sidebar, I somehow managed to convince her to let me measure her:

* Underbust = 42""
* Tight Underbust = 41.5""   (Barely different...if I would put hardly any pressure on the tape she'd complain it was too tight.)
* Standing Bust = 43""    (Immediately she says, ""see, a whole 1 inch...A cup"".)
* Leaning Bust = 44.5""   (This might be slightly low, since she kinda pulled it somewhat snug and was resisting the whole concept of measuring this way.)

So from those numbers, she'd be a 42C.  I mentioned C cup and she almost started laughing in my face like I was insane.  This was followed by lots of exaggerated statements and the ole ""see they barely fit in my tiny girl hands, they're A"".   I tried to mention the band size vs cup size thing, but she shot me down and got agitated and ""A cups are A cups no matter the band"".  So this is going to be a long road...

Her current bras are like 36 or 38 band...either A or B cups.  She uses the band extenders (often 2 or even 3) to make them actually fit around her.   She acts like bigger bands don't even exist.  All the straps on all her bras are completely meaningless.   Even set as tight as they can go, they fall off her shoulders constantly.

I'm not sure how to proceed.  She's never even been for a bra fitting in her life (we're in our 30s), and she doesn't seem interested in even trying it.  She's just convinced she has small worthless ugly boobs.  I could try to get her into a store, but it's going to be really hard to find a store where she could actually try on any realistic choices.   I could order a bunch of different ones, but I also don't want her to think I've gone insane. =)   Thoughts, comments, and suggestions are welcomed...

I've had personal experiences with bra fitters that make me cringe, and I've read some of your experiences that made me really angry. As someone with large breasts, I have been shamed enough because of my body, I do not need some skinny sales associate telling me that I will never find a good fitting bra at my size.

Lastly, I'm not going to impose my sizing views on people. Ultimately, it is the bra-wearer's body that needs to be comfortable, and if you like the cleavage of a bra that is a size too small, or if a proper fitting band just isn't comfortable, I'm not going to force you to make a purchase. I've had fitters tell me that my slight quad-boob was fine, and wouldn't be noticeable under shirts, even though I was not comfortable in the bra. I'm not really sure what this post was meant to be, maybe it's just the start of my soon to be business plan. Ultimately, I want to say thank you, both from me and my girls.

I used words like 'often' and 'not unusual' and that was a mistake, these things happen, but even if it is seldom I think it can be a problem. As I said, if I am wrong I wnat to know that. I am here to learn. I have not tried to give the impression that I know more than other contributors here, on the contrary. Hopefully we can have an open discussion.**/edit**

I am still a newbie in the bra fitting world, but I've read constantly on this subreddit and many different blogs and resources these past few months, so hopefully I know some things. If anything in this post is incorrect I would appreciate to be corrected on that.

I have seen [this](http://drueberunddrunter.blogspot.de/2012/04/english-reversed-letterphobia-and-war.html) article and read some other information on the phenomena mentioned in the title and it worries me that it seems to be mostly ignored here at /r/ABraThatFits.

It's not unusual that women get the advice to start out with a bandsize smaller than their supertight measurement, something that seems strange to me. Some users I trust have mentioned  that you should wear a band as loose enough as possible without losing support so starting out with the tightest possible band is not useful.

I've seen many fit checks where the wires are clearly distorted, a sign of a too tight band, where the woman still get recommended to try a tighter band. When a torso is shaped in the way that many larger women are, larger further down and getting thinner further up, a band riding up can be a sign of a too tight band as well. 

New subscribers often write that they tried a bra in the bandsize they were recommended and that it was extremely uncomfortable, and they get told they'll get used to it and even downvoted. I am aware that too small cups can make a band feel too tight, but that is not always the issue.

Even very thin women, with small differences between snug and supertight measurements get recommended to start out with their supertight one. This also happens with small-breasted women. These are women who don't necessarily need a very tight band.

First of all I think there needs to be awareness of this, and let's not be so quick to recommend tighter bands. Secondly, one solution would be to start using 'bra fitting expert'-flairs as I've seen suggested elsewhere, so when someone with a flair says something about the band tightness, they are taken seriously (I've seen people downvoted for suggesting to try a looser band).

We currently have a men's and unisex line, but I've been tasked with creating the women's line.  One of them main goals I have is to redesign the straps/fit so it fits women well (current bags are definitely fit to a male frame).  I have a few ideas, but I wanted to ask a some general questions, if you'd be kind enough to answer:

1- How well do the backpacks you've worn fit?  If they fit well, can you explain why and which brand/model you're referring to?  Was it a female-specific model?  If they fit poorly or are uncomfortable can you explain why?  For example if the strap digs into your neck.

2- How often do you wear a backpack?  How much weight is in it?  How long do you wear it at one time?

3- Any other related insights?

ps. I am male so I don't have any first hand experience in the matter...

I got measured at Bravissimo (I'm from the UK) before I discovered this subreddit. 

I've always worn a 32DD or a 32E (the latter being what places like M&amp;S and Debenhams sized me at) and they fitted ok, but a 32DD would sometimes feel too small on the cups and a 32E seemed to fit better but never felt like it was properly giving me the 'oomph' I desired.

I went in for a fitting at Bravissimo and was surprised that she didn't use any measuring tape. She took a look at me, gave me a range of about three sizes to try and eventually settled on 28F/FF as my size, and oh my god it fitted perfectly. 

Anyway I have just recently discovered this sub and sized myself according to the fitting guide, and lo' and behold, I got a 28F measurement! I thought it was pretty cool that the girl at Bravissimo was so spot on :)

Also, I went in to Victoria's Secrets and they put me at a 34D...What the hell? It was clearly WAY too small on the cup, my nipples were quite literally trying to make a run for it (they were actually visible), the gore was completely elevated, the band was huge and the girl just slightly adjusts it and says ""looks like a perfect fit!"" Really unbelievable. 

I mean I know M&amp;S and Debenhams got it slightly wrong, but 32E is at least somewhat close (sister size wise) to a 28F/FF and it was never ill-fitting. VS were just wayyyy off the mark.

The fitter (am I allowed to post names if itâs in a positive light?) asked me my name and what I was looking for, and after I explained the issue (current bra bought from the Melbourne store digging into armpits), she brought me into the change rooms and brought out several bras that would address the issue I was experiencing. 

The fitter spent over an hour with me, trying on what felt like more than two dozen bras. She was extremely supportive and positive, even when I was very negative about finding the right bra. She even spoke to her manager about providing me with a completely unasked for discount as an apology for the Melbourne store fitting me into the wrong bra. 

I ended up walking out with exactly what I was looking for and with my confidence boosted. If thereâs any busty ladies in the Melbourne area, please go check Brava Prahran out. It may be slightly pricy, but the service you receive is amazing. I just felt like everyone should know :)

We all know that we are born with a certain amount of adipose tissue that is located on genetically predetermined places on our bodies, and that that tissue shrinks and grows with us.

Before I measured her, I explained to her exactly why I said it was the wrong size: the gore wasn't tacking, she was quadboobing, 
spilling out of the sides, and her band was so loose I could fit both hands through it (tuns out she was wearing a 38B. At least she understands sister sizes. I think.)

So then I explained about migrated breast tissue, and how the cup was *supposed* to fit and enclose all of her breast tissue. Also, I learned she wasn't scooping and swooping. She just kinda jiggled them twice and left them to their own devices. Well then.

""No way! F is huge! I don't know where you learned this, but it must be wrong!""

-sigh-Okay

I walked over to my dresser, grabbed one of my old super tiny bras, and tossed it at her. ""Try that on."" And you know what? After she scooped and swooped, the gore tacked, and it looked damn good. It was loose at the top of the cup, but it was also a bit big in the band.

""Okay, but is the top of the cup supposed to come up this high? It feels weird"" Is it poking you? No? Then you'll be fine. 

So I let her adjust to it for a few minutes. Then, after she was comfortable and realized it really did fit her pretty well, she looked at me and said ""What size is this thing, anyway?""

""That's a 36F, momma. Enjoy your big boobs.""

Ladies, I could've sworn she was going to start crying. She just looked down at her boobs and said ""....I'm an F?""

Then she started laughing, kissed me on the cheek, and she wants to take me shopping next weekend. 'Cause apparently she needs new bras or something. ;P

TL;DR- Just read it, there's a happy ending.

Edit: After this, I also got her to let me measure my 12 year old sister, who she's been buying 34/36 As for, and that girl has bigger boobs than some adult women I know.

So last night I realized after using the guide from MyWifesBusty, I was wearing the wrong bra! I've been wearing the wrong bra for who knows how long. But the sizing didn't make sense as 32 bands had hurt me in the past by leaving deep and painful red marks that could not possibly be healthy. I was wearing a 34b (or a 34a in some brands). However according to measurements I'm actually a 32c. 

After getting some **extremely** helpful advice from this subreddit I ventured out to target on my lunch break. Unsurprisingly they didn't have a single 32c in stock. I guess it's considered a weird size. For funsies I decided to try on [a 34c](http://i.imgur.com/YDTUp.jpg) to my surprise it wasn't as humungous as I imagined, so I guess the measurements were on to something. I then tried on my usual bra which is a 34b to critique how it fit me with my new found knowledge. Still doubting the measurements. [Then this happened](http://i.imgur.com/qHdte.jpg). SQUISH! The cups were definitely not right. No amount of stuffing could make the wires sit right and I realized that most of the bras I own sit like that, I just never thought anything of it.

After work I headed to Nordstrom. Walking in I had anxiety, the last time I walked into a bra-shop many years ago and asked for my size (or what I thought was my size) I was told by a very snotty sales woman that there was ""No way"" I was that size, implying I was much much smaller. Deja vu hit me as the nicely dressed sales woman asked me if she could help me. I said ""Uh.....I've been wearing the wrong size bra. I think I need a 32c."" And I waited for her to look me up and down and scoff. OBVIOUSLY those tiny puppies are A's at best. 

""Sure! What style do you prefer?"" She asked without missing a beat. I told her I liked demis and she offered to grab me a sampler of all the different demis she had in my size. The first one I put on is the one you'll see below. It's by DKNY and it was $40. I fell in love with it. It fit like a glove, the band was tight and snug but not excruciating and the cups sat exactly where they were supposed to. As I tried on more and more I found that with two exceptions they all fit. Sadly the two most beautiful ones had issues. One brand's bands ran too small for me to feel comfortable, the lace scratched when I tried to turn the bra around on me. Another brand's cups were just a little too small and the 32d cups were a little too big up top. (Fit exactly like the 34c actually)

I wound up with four bras and I'm going to buy a couple more next payday. 

[This is how my new bra fits.](http://imgur.com/a/7Mvbw) It's the DKNY bra I fell in love with, it looks nude but it's actually a really subtle pink that will pretty much work for nude under the few light colored shirts I own.

And lastly [here is a side by side comparison](http://i.imgur.com/9Alzr.jpg) of the bra I WAS wearing underneath one of the bras I just bought that is actually my size. You can see how far off I was. No wonder I've still got baby fat around my armpits, it was probably being forced up there by those tiny cups.

After I calmed down I ordered a bra (Freya.) When I told my mother she said G cups were ""pornstar sized"" and that it was ""crazy"" which made me really nervous all over again. Add to that the fact I tried to discuss it with a friend of mine at work and she told me that sounded ""way off"" and she ""used to work for Victoria's Secret"" and that I was most likely a 36C... I was a wreck all over again.

So yesterday, I did what I haven't done since puberty. I went to Dillards and I tried on bras. I picked up a 32D, 32DD, and 32DDD (which is as big as cup sizes go there.) I put on the 32D and I could have cried. The 32 band size felt so right that even without putting the cups all the way up I felt better. I could tell right away though that the cups were too small. And I was right. I spilled out of them even without scooping. After I did that, my nipples wouldn't even fit! I tried on the 32DD with only slightly better results. Next, a 32DDD which I had to have an employee help me hunt down. No dice.

Long story short, none of those bras came close to fitting my cup size. But despite nearly having hysterics in the dressing room (my life was being flip-turned upside down!) I'm very, very glad I did it. I put my mind at rest about both the band and the cup size of the bra I sized for. A 32 band is perfect and a G cup will come close to being perfect, if not spot-on.

Even though my mother still thinks ""that makes no sense"" I highly recommend anyone worried about whether their new E/F/G/etc size will dwarf them go and do this. They probably won't have your size but trying on some DD and DDD (which I was convinced would be HUGE) and seeing just how small they are on you will do you a world of good! Now instead of being apprehensive about my bra I'm super excited for it to get here and see how it fits!

I went to my local lingerie store to try and find some bargains after I finally found the right size for me (28E, by the way). I was happily strolling through the store when I noticed a store clerk coming up to me. ""May I help you?"" I though, sure, why not right, it's not like she has to do a fitting, she just has to find the ones in my size. So I told her my size and my favourite brands and I followed her as she picked out the ones with the right size.

Then something unbelievable happened.

I saw one that I liked and I pointed at it and asked for it in my size. She checked if they had it in stock, but alas. Then she said:

""Maybe you could try a 38DD?""

I thought, maybe it was just a mistake, maybe she meant to say 28, or maybe I heard her wrong (I'm slightly deaf). I said ""Sorry, what?"" as I looked at her lips to make sure I wasn't mishearing anything. She answered: ""You could try to go down a size and try a 38DD.""

I was speechless. How could ANY woman think bra sizes work ANYTHING like that? She pushed the 38DD into my hands, and I was so absolutely dumbfounded, I actually went into the fitting room and put it on. Surely, she would realize she was mistaken if she saw the horrible fit.

I showed her the horribly fitting band, she looked at it, and said (I kid you not): ""Well, you obviously need a much smaller size. Have you tried a B cup?""

I just said ""Ummmm, no thanks"" and left immediately.

(Plus size),titsinasock,45,7,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/1hrwy2/been_trying_to_find_a_good_bra_for_3_months_im/,"I'm going to start with my measurements. Underbust 45"", snug 43"", breakthetape 42"". Breast measurement standing 58"", bending 60"", on my back 56"". My breasts are long and flattish. Nipples point down. There is 4.5"" vertical skin to skin overlap at the breast root, so I have had some problems with infections in the past.

I have been wearing some old JustMySize bras for a while. I buy any size I can fit, so usually a 50 or 52 band with a D or DD cup. These bras hook in the front so It is uniboob city and my nips get all droopy or cross-eyed and I am very self conscious about that.

I have been lurking here for a couple of months so I learned not to add inches to the underbust, and I have tried a few orders and sent them back. I have made a spreadsheet so I don't order the same thing twice and can keep track of the fit problems with each one. BTW I have never had an underwire bra, and considering my bust size that's what I'm trying to find.

I started with an Elia 46J. (This one was wirefree) The cups were huge, even with the scoop and swoop. Also, they were pointy and I don't want pointy. All the empty space was at the top of the cup, but the bottom of the cup was plastered flat against my ribcage. My notes say the band was very tight, but obvs I am not used to a snug band after the stretchy JMS bras.  

I have some flexibility problems* so I need to be able to hook in the front. I can hook in front and slide around to the back, but the 46"" is very difficult to twist around. I sent that one back, and tried 3 different styles for the second order.

I went for 48G on all three styles. All underwire. 

The Leading Lady bra was a molded seamless which would have made me very happy about the lack of nipple show-through, but the cup was hysterically large. I could poke big dents in it with my finger. The band was very stretchy.

The Comfort Choice petal boost had a soft knit cup which provided no support at all, plus the fabric puckered a lot at the top. Band size was not uncomfortable. I named this bra ""Tits in a sock"". It was truly horrifying to look at.

The last bra in the second order was also a Comfort Choice 48G. It was so pretty. Notes say cup too big on top, band OK. Underwires ride down my torso. 

Sent them all back.

Third order, 4 bras, all underwire, all 48F (One 48DDD)

I had great hopes for the Bali minimizer, (48DDD) but I had to give up trying to get it on. I almost got stuck in it. Very short straps.

Then 3 Glamorise bras (48F) all underwire. Two of them I could get on but it was not easy. Even with a 48 band I had to wiggle them around a half-inch at a time. The straps were problematic to pull up, but the gore poked waaaay out and that was the dealbreaker for those two.

I sent the 2 Glamorise bras back with the Bali, and kept one.
The catalog name for it is ""Wonderwire Alluring Underwire Bra"". Also a 48F. It's the closest thing I have found so far, but so far I can only go 4 hours in it before I have to switch. Also, the underwire rides down so my breast root and breast are in contact. 
It looks so good though. I have been so jealous of the cute balconette styles I see so many pictures of on this site. It was, of course, the most expensive of all the bras so far.

I am scooping &amp; swooping on all of them, but there is a general trend towards empty space at the top of the cup, and cup fabric pulled tight against the breast root. I bend over and try to jam those wires right at the root and fill in the bottom of the cup but there is always some downward drift.

* I have frozen shoulder on my left side and can't reach behind me or above my head. I shattered my right elbow in 2000, and that arm can reach behind me but it still has limitations. I had to learn how to insert tampons with my left hand, and boy howdy, that was not fun.

I am tired and discouraged. I look at pictures and can't imagine that there isn't a little bit of breast root/skin contact, but I suppose everyone is shaped differently. Not only do I fail the pencil test, I think I could stick an entire box of crayons under there and they wouldn't fall out.

I would like a bra that is not pointy, hopefully with underwire, and have my nips above elbow height and not all over the place.
So that is where I am in this process, please, any advice or opinion is welcomed.

Here's what I put into Bratabase:

&gt;I have very shallow, slightly conical/tubular breasts that have a wide root.

&gt;While not perfect, this is definitely the best strapless bra I've tried on (and I've tried on a lot). It is the only strapless bra that I am okay with keeping and wearing out in public. The cups are very shallow. They do cut in at the top. If it weren't a strapless bra, I would say that it cuts in enough for me to return it. After trying on some of my strapless clothes, though, I think it looks good enough to keep.

&gt;The bra seems simultaneously cheap and well-constructed. It seems well-constructed in that there's a few little details I don't normally see on bras in my size range. There's actual boning in the wings on this bra, and there's three hooks per column in the back. It feels cheap, though, in that the inside of the cups is just...foam. I'm not sure how to describe it, but I would definitely agree that sweating will probably be an issue with this bra.

&gt;I do like that this bra is nude and is light on the frills: I like my strapless bras to be practical, not fancy.

&gt;My rib cage fluctuates between 28"" and 29"", and I would say that the band on this 30D bra is perfect. I definitely could not fit into a 28 band for this one.

[And now for pictures](http://imgur.com/a/gw0xg)!  I have included pics of just the bra, and also the bra on underneath a strapless shirt and a strapless dress I own.  The green shirt has some padding in the bra area; the plaid dress does not.  Just for giggles, I also included pics of myself with my old strapless bra - a 32A pushup from some department store about 10 years ago.  Embarrassing.  No wonder I used to hate my boobs.

Anyways, as you can see, it's not perfect.  I'm resigned to the fact that until bra manufacturers start making strapless bras in other shapes, nothing will ever fit perfectly.  In fact, I am kicking around the idea of converting one of my existing strapped bras into a strapless.  But until I work up the courage, I think that the Toffi will do.

Note: The smallest size that EM stocks in this bra is a 65D (30D).  You can get sizes 60D-F (28D-F) custom made, but if you're in the 28A-C and 30A-C range, you're out of luck. :(  I hear that the Freya Deco/Taylor strapless bra also often works for shallow breasts.  It was definitely my next best fitting strapless after the Toffi.  I just didn't deem it quite good enough to buy/keep.

So I want to fill out the bra list a bit better.

For those of you with shallow breasts, please list all of the bras you have tried on, and sort them into two categories: bras that fit, and bras that did not fit.  In addition, please tell me your bra size (or, if you're not comfortable with that, please just let me know if you consider yourself to have smaller boobs or larger boobs).

Examples of acceptable criteria for determining that a bra does not fit:

* cup cuts in too much at the top
* cups not wide enough
* cups too deep
* gore too wide
* weird gaping

Examples of unacceptable criteria (ie, do not say that a bra does not fit for the following reasons):

* it only comes in pink
* too many frills
* the lace/hem shows through my shirts

I understand that many bras fall into this grey zone of where it kinda fits, but not perfectly.  Use your best judgement for these bras.  If it's a bra that you would keep, call it a ""fit"".  If it's a bra you would send back for a refund, call it a ""does not fit.""  Bikini tops are completely welcome additions to this list!  Please be as specific as possible when compiling your list.

Also I don't mind if you upvote other posts, but it would be greatly appreciated if you could also make your own post with your own experiences, even if it's just an abbreviated list.

Thank you for all of your time and effort.

1366925250.0,38,self.ABraThatFits,1d3z9t,[Guide] A Maternity/Nursing Bra That Fits!,marcelinevampyrqueen,41,3,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/1d3z9t/guide_a_maternitynursing_bra_that_fits/,"**Pregnancy**  
You donât have to wear a maternity bra during your pregnancy. If there arenât any made in your size, you hate the styles offered, or they are too expensive for you, just buy regular bras or nursing bras. This should probably be obvious, but isnât, because advertising people are really good at their jobs. You do not need to wear wireless bras throughout pregnancy. The problems many pregnancy books mention are caused by the fact that too many women wear wired bras in the wrong size. If the cups are too small or too narrow, the wires will sit on breast tissue, which can be highly uncomfortable for pregnant women and interfere with milk production. Please measure yourself according to [the sources in the sidebar]( http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/rh26h/is_getting_fitted_for_a_bra_as_humiliating_as_it/c469bi0) if you haven't already. 

If you do buy unwired bras, buy nursing bras with clips instead of maternity bras without clips. The bras you'll buy during the second trimester of pregnancy won't fit you right after birth, but will usually fit again after a few months postpartum. It is a bit of a gamble, but one that tends to work more often than not. So the bras you buy during pregnancy do not need to be cheap throwaway bras. 

Read reviews to see if the bras score high on comfort, because nothing is worse than being pregnant and uncomfortable. Most books say you grow in the first trimester and then stop, or only grow a little more after that. Thatâs true for some people, but not for everybody. Quite a lot of women grow in the second and the third trimester too. 

Bras that you buy during the first two trimesters of pregnancy should fit you ok on the tightest or middle hook. (This is opposite of the regular fitting advice to buy bras that fit ok on the widest hook.) As your ribcage expands you can switch to the wider hooks or use extenders. Many good nursing bras come with more than two or three columns of hooks for this purpose; four to six is common. As long as you need only a wider band, [extenders]( http://www.walmart.com/ip/3-Bra-Back-Extender-White/19757819?_mm=) work fine. Remember that you can daisy-chain extenders if your ribcage expands more than a single extender can accommodate. But if you need a larger cup, you'll need to buy new bras.

Some sources will recommend stretchy bras that will allow for some fluctuation in size. [Crop top bras from companies like Medela]( http://www.amazon.com/Medela-Comfort-Nursing-Bra/dp/B0008MFDEI) are popular for this. But many women with larger cup sizes find them unsupportive; the stretchy fabric allows too much room for the sensitive breast tissue to move which can be highly uncomfortable.  

During the very last stages of pregnancy many women find underwire bras uncomfortable, because the wires dig into the belly. This can be especially a problem for women with breach babies who carry high. Some nursing bra makers use relatively soft wires in their bras specifically for this purpose, but it is often at this stage that many switch to non-wired bras. 

If you are seeking to order nursing bras one or two weeks before your due date, note it is a bit unpredictable to say what size you'll be after giving birth. But try a band size down and a few cup sizes up from what you measure. Say you measure currently as a 34F UK, you'll need a band size down (=32FF UK) and 2-3 cup sizes up, so 32GG/H UK should do the trick.  

**The First 6 Weeks Postpartum**  
Most books recommended not wearing bras with underwire until your milk supply has fully regulated. I disagree. The reason given in the books is the wires interfere with milk ducts, but this is only true for too small bras. It should not happen if you wear the right shape in the right size. In fact, wearing an underwire bra might have saved me a lot of pain when my daughter and I were getting started breastfeeding.

I only brought a sleep bra to the hospital with me. Newborns want to nurse all the time. They are still learning, and you are still learning, so it is a lot of work for very little payoff at first. The night before my milk came in, my daughter nursed 20 minutes on, 20 off for 10 straight hours. Itâs not worth fiddling with a bra while you are waiting to produce milk instead of colostrum. Engorgement, however, is another story. Soon after your milk comes in, you will find that your boobs are massive and rock hard. They will seriously weigh more than you thought they ever could. 

If you are larger than average, the weight of them can actually block your milk ducts- and this is what I meant when I said if I had a properly supportive bra, I might have avoided some pain. I got [mastitis]( http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/mastitis/DS00678) (an infection, most frequently caused by blocked ducts) three times in the first two months of my babyâs life. Mastitis feels like the flu, only worse, because your breasts hurt and you have a screaming baby to take care of. Wearing underwires that are too narrow is a near guarantee that you will get mastitis. Err on the side of caution here. The wires need to be well clear of your breast tissue. You will also want a bra that is either very open on top or has stretchy lace to accommodate for sudden change in size. Wearing a too-small bra is also very likely to result in mastitis; bras that reshape your breasts against its natural shape and bend the milk ducts can have the same effect. (Ewa Michalak nursing bras are notorious for this, which is why they are not recommended for mothers who are not at least 6 months post-partum.)

The first couple months of breastfeeding, your breasts will fluctuate sizes fairly rapidly. At this stage, milk production is largely hormonal (not supply-and-demand like later on). It is not worth really stocking up on bras until your size has more or less settled - usually around three months. 

**Three months to six months**  
At this point, your nursing relationship should not be as stressful anymore. You are probably pretty confident in your ability to nurture your baby with your body, even if things started out a little difficult. Or youâve settled into a routine of splitting formula/breastmilk, which is also fine! But your breasts are finally getting to where they will stay for a while. You can now measure yourself again using the resources in the sidebar. If you find you are in the 32-40 C-F range, you will probably not have any problems finding nursing bras that fit you, and cute ones at that! If youâre sized out of that, though, you still have options. Any bra can be converted into a nursing bra. If you are on the smaller side, you can generally slide the strap off your shoulder and pull your breast out of the cup to nurse. I do this with both soft cup and padded cup bras with no problem. (I did, however, tear a Freya Deco, so I donât recommend doing this with moulded cup bras.)

**Six months to a year**  
Remeasure yourself at six months, even if it seems like your three month bras are still working. If nothing else, itâs interesting to see if the numbers have changed at all. Depending on if you wore ill-fitting bras before or during pregnancy, you may have experienced [tissue remigration](http://bustyresources.wikia.com/wiki/Migrated_breast_tissue) by now, and could end up sizing down in band and/or up in cup size. As long as you are nursing, measuring every three months is a good idea, but from this point on your size will probably stay about the same.

**One year to weaned**  
First, congratulate yourself on making it this far. You have provided the best possible nourishment for your baby! Around one year old, your child will probably eat more solid foods and nurse less often- three or four times a day, then two, then maybe only at night. Keep remeasuring yourself every three months or as needed. Nurse as long as you and your child want to, keeping in mind that left to their own devices, children usually wean completely between 2 and 7 years of age and it is perfectly healthy to keep going as long as you want. Once your child is completely weaned, it can take up to a year to completely dry up. You will likely return to your pre-pregnancy size, give or take a cup size (even if you are shaped a little differently now).

So I just stumbled across this subreddit from a comment in the Victoria's Secret AMA. Just for funsies I decided to use the measurement chart I found on the sidebar. I now feel like crying. I have always worn a 34 B (I live in the US) my whole life. I recently lost about 30 lbs and noticed my bras gapping a lot at the top (the cup part). When I went to the mall a few months ago I figured I'd gone down to an A cup. I was measured at the Aerie store and the girl told me I was a 36 B. Color me confused since I lost weight not gained weight. The 36 looked ridiculous so I tried on the 36 A and it fit even worse than the 36 B. So I gave up...

I measured myself tonight and the measurements I got put me at a 28D!! I have never even SEEN that bra size before. I tried the Victoria's Secret sizing chart just for curiosity (not even really trying but just a general  idea) and it said 30 A! They don't even make a size below 32!!

So I am just sitting here blown away. To give some perspective I am 5'0"" and about 108 lbs with relatively small breasts.

While at the mall today, we stopped at Dillard's to see if we could find some bras for her. She's been wearing 36B, so she has a lot of migrated tissue and didn't want to splurge on a bunch of bras and have them all not fit in a couple months, so we ultimately only bought one bra for her ([this](http://btemptd.wacoal-america.com/shop/bras/up-to-ddd-cup/b-tempt-d-la-parisienne-push-up-underwire-bra_958157.html?index=5&amp;searchCategoryId=24001&amp;totalResults=10&amp;displayMarkdownsOnly=false) bra in black/white, which fit better with the pushup pads pulled out).

On the way to finding a bra she liked, she tried on a bunch of bras in a variety of styles and sizes. I took one out of the fitting rooms to ask one of the saleswomen if it came in 32DDD or 32E instead of the 34DD, since the particular bra had a band that ran larger than usual. Apparently this particular bra did not, but she helped me find a couple bras in 32DDD for my mom to try, which were all boring grandma bras. 

The woman asked me if they were for me, which made me laugh a little bit, since these were all obviously much too large in the cup for someone as small-busted as myself. She asked who was helping my mother in the fitting room, and I said that I was, which seemed to disturb her a little bit. She insisted on measuring my mom, measuring her with a bra on (which happened to be a pushup she was trying just for fun), and took her bust and [overbust](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-96hljhopBCI/T_CY1bxRNFI/AAAAAAAAAhA/CSGfquNtSg0/s1600/VS+006.jpg) measurement, declaring her to be a 34D. I asked as politely as I could, ""why take the band measurement up there? That's not where she wears the band."" and the woman said with a huff that she had been professionally trained and that was the way to measure correctly-- any other way was wrong, she said. This was after I had been chatting about my idea to open a bra boutique with this woman while selecting bras on the sales floor, and that I had been studying bras and fitting for several months in order to prepare for doing so. She was not very pleased with me, I think. Probably thought I was some smartass know-it-all, and quickly left the room.

It's really a shame that a ""professionally trained"" fitter has the wrong idea about fitting. I'm glad to see that she didn't do the +4 on her underbust, but taking an overbust measurement for the band and then deciding a cup size too small was really disappointing.

But I wanted to clarify a few things, based on both my own body and the experiences that I have had fitting other women. Namely:

*some small-busted women will always have 'armpit fat', despite scooping and swooping.*

I got my sister to draw me a picture, which is [here](http://i.imgur.com/OKYCq.png).

The green outline would be a good fit (notice that the wire is containing all of our model's breast tissue, that the center gore would tack if she were real, etc.). To get that little bit of armpit fat into the cup, we would have to go way up in the cup (like the red outline). [Here's](http://d3ne0z7j3pntwx.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/public/styles/large/public/size1.jpg) a picture that shows a woman with a good fit, but if her arms were down at her sides, you would see some of that armpit fat.

It basically boils down to breast shape in a way that correlates with size. Everyone has the little bit of 'armpit fat' - the [axillary tail](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_of_Spence). When breasts go to the side beyond the contours of the ribcage, like what happens in most fuller-busted women, the axillary tail is more a part of the breast tissue and needs to be contained in the cup. In women who are closer-set or smaller-busted, this tail is more of a separate entity. To try to get it into the cup would be a futile effort. What matters in these women is that the wire is just outside of your breast tissue, generally pointing into your armpit.

So, basically, armpit fat isn't the end of the world in all women. It doesn't automatically mean to go up the cup size.

Today, my Nordstrom order arrived. Two Freya Decos in a 30E. This was it -- if I wasn't a 30E, I was a 30F. I had already tried a 32E (too big in the cups), 28F (too small in the cups, excruciatingly painful band and underwire jammed into my ribs), and a 32F (cups too big). I made a gamble and ordered 2 Decos in a 30E since Nordstrom is having an Anni sale and the Deco is $39 USD compared to $60 USD. If they fit, I would have two fitting bras in the basic colours. If not, I could send them back.

I apprehensively put on the bra. Band was good -- tight but not suffocating like the 28 (I am 29""-29.5"" underbust) -- and the cups seemed to be a good fit. All of my breast tissue filled the cups after a bit of a scoop, swoop, and jiggle, and they didn't quadboob. And holy shit the cleavage. 

The moment was amazing. I finally found a bra that fit snugly and lifted me without leaving tons of extra room in the cups or quadboobing. I felt like my boobs were lifted to my chin rather than sitting in my socks, and it was amazing.

I figured I would share with you guys the pictures of my 34C bra (that I was wearing yesterday) and my 30E, since I would've never found a better bra size without you guys.

Due in part to orthopedic bracing through my developing years I have a very small amount of breast tissue, so most of my chest is just pectoral muscle. This would be just fine and dandy without a bra except for the fact that I have incredibly perky nipples that show themselves off through almost anything.

Every time I've tried a bra with any kind of padding (including training bras) I wind up with a cavernous empty space that collapses unnaturally whenever I bump into something. Every time I try a bra without padding I might as well not be wearing one because my nipples are on display for all to see.

I've worked with two half-solutions over time. The only comfortable thing I've found is camis with built in shelf bras. My nipples still show but I just wear a loose-fitting decorative tank over top and it covers them up. When I wear t-shirts I'm forced to resort to these terrible, cheap wal-mart ""sports bras"" that are made of layers of that cheap cotton jersey fabric that ends up being thick enough to keep those perky suckers down. They are incredibly sweaty and uncomfortable, the 32 size digs and makes my back sore, but the 34 size flops around loosely so I just wear the 32.

The measurement guide says I'm a 26D (???) but I find that really hard to believe. If a 32 band digs how would I fit in a 26? And I understand cup size is relative but really... there's nothing to cup.

Here's the measurements so you guys can have a go.

The summer before my freshman year of high school, out of the blue, BAM D cups (or so I thought). My mother and sister are both A cups, and were as bamboozled as I was. So, we went to get me fitted was at Victoria's Secret and was measured at a 36C, then a 34D, and finally a 34DD. We went three times because the bra never fit right. Anyway, they just kept telling me to go up a band size. Yeah, that'll help! 

Anyway, I'm in college now, still in those ill-fitting bras I got in high school. One day, as my boyfriend poked my quad-boob, he decided to mention ""There's a sub for that."" So here I am, kind of dumbfounded and looking at before-fit pictures of boobies that look like mine! (Also apparently there's a movement against VS?)

SO! I got a cloth tape, enlisted my boyfriend's help, and followed the measuring guide as best I could. Results:
Band: 29.5-30""
Bust: 39""
This came out to a 30I... 
First of all I'm skeptical. Shouldn't an I sized cup eat my face? My boobs don't eat my face. Also, where does one shop for a 30I bra? The only places that sell bras in my town are VS and Target. It was hard enough finding pretty bras in 34DD.

Measurements:
28.5-31 under
38.5/41/39 over

Cleo Juna has been a nightmare for me. I cannot make that mother fit for ANYTHING. I know I'm VFOB and wide-root, but I've decided I'm not as shallow as I thought, I'm just more pendulous than I would like to believe. I've spent too much time and money trying to make this bra work. I have a 28H that I recently took the extender off, and it's ok, but tight and leaves an empty dimple at the upper-outer corne, even with my nipple near the top of the cup. My 30GG (Darcy, same bra) is more comfortable but gapes. Other fails:  32G (too big all over), 30G (quadboob), 28GG (tight, quadboob).

I have a 30FF Freya Patsy padded halfcup with a too-big band and a too-small cup. Other 30 bras have been comfortable, but never the right shape. The shape change from G-GG does something funky. 28GG Lucy: fail. 30G Panache somethingorother: fail.

Then I noticed something. My straightjacket 28H rides up in the back. I said to myself, ""HOW?"" My btt is 28.5. There's no way I can wear anything smaller.

I posted the other day about how my 32DDD wacoal retro chic fits like a dream, and does NOT ride up. That made me decide to experiment... What if I went up to  32 in a brand that runs tight (Cleo)  and down to a FF, and changed to horizontal seams? 

So... my Cleo Marcie ($35 at Nordstrom) arrived today. It's PERFECT. No collapsed lungs, no ride-up, no digging into the armpits, no gaping, no quadboob, and FINALLY.... NO DIMPLE IN THE BREAST. For the first time since starting this journey, I HAVE UPPER FULLNESS.

Bra-lleluia, holy crap. I KNEW there had to be something better.

Walked away with one decent bra and got my mom in the right size, though!",ToeJamSandwich,39,4,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/194fa9/today_i_had_one_of_the_most_frustrating_shopping/,"Errr... this will be long. I don't know how to be brief.

I've been in desperate need of new bras. For the past year or so, I've been wearing 34A bras, purchased for about ten bucks each at Marshall's. Recently, after reading some tips on bra fitting from this subreddit, I purchased a 32C bra. It was an improvement, but definitely not perfect. The gore doesn't lie flat and the band is not nearly tight enough, but it's at least a bit more comfortable. Since then, I've been on this subreddit nearly every day. I've read all the links in the sidebar, and like to think I've lurked enough fit checks to know what a bra should look/feel like. When I measured myself, I came out to be somewhere between a 28D and a 28DD. For the time being, I've sort of given up on buying a bra in that size. I am but a lowly child that relies on her parents for most clothing items, and something tells me they wouldn't be too keen on ordering their tiny daughter double D bras from Europe.

Anyways, today my mom took me out bra shopping because I've basically been on a bra strike and have been living in sports bras and camis for the past week. I knew I wasn't going to be able to find any 28Ds in any of the stores we were going to, but decided to humor her anyways. (She didn't believe me when I explained my size.) So off to the mall we went!

We started in JCPenney, where my family usually gets their underthings. There was nothing. The smallest bands they had were 34. After a quick glance at the racks, we got out of there pretty quickly.

Next was Victoria's Secret, which was one of the most awful and laughable shopping experiences of my life. (I had a pretty good time pointing out that the manikins weren't even wearing the right size. All of them had the band riding way, way up in the back!) I picked two bras: one push-up (32C), and two unpadded (32B and 32C). The push up gave me the most ridiculous amount of spillage I've ever seen in my life. Like, there's cleavage, and then there's the things this bra was doing to my breasts. The 32B was just kind of meh and the wires dug into my chest, which wasn't much of a surprise. 

The best was the unpadded, flimsy 32C, which broke as I pulled the strap up. I kid you not, it snapped right off. 

Meanwhile, as I'm growing steadily more and more frustrated, I listen to the saleslady/""sizer"" talk to other customers. That was pretty laughable, too. You there, you with the big boobs! You are a double D! And you, with the even bigger boobs! You are also a double D but with a huge band! Now would you like that in super-duper pushup or a super-duper-ally-ooper pushup?""

Anyways, I left Victoria's Secret with a card for a discounted bra and no intention of ever coming back. 

Next stop was Macy's, which was different than JCpenny in that it was more expensive, but similar in that it also had nothing. 

Then it was Nordstrom. I like Nordstrom because when they measured me last time they told me straight up it would be hard to find a bra in my ""real"" size. They didn't even try to shove me into an A-cup with a huge band, they just gave me a 30C and said even though it wasn't perfect, it was a huge improvement. But my goodness, so damn expensive! I ended up getting a [Betsy Johnson 30C bra](http://shop.nordstrom.com/s/betsey-johnson-stocking-stripe-underwire-t-shirt-bra/3118600), which was really comfortable and fit pretty well. I still feel like the band is a little loose, but it's definitely more than tolerable. 

The best part was my mother, though. My poor mom, who doesn't like to splurge on herself and always seems to settle, timidly asked to be measured. ""Just to see."" The lady asked what size she was wearing, she said a 36D. It was bad. Gaping at the top of the cups, the band riding up the back, saggy looking boobies...

She measured into a 32F. She didn't believe it could be right, but when she tried it on she was amazed. She said she never knew a bra could be that comfortable. And holey moley, the difference it made in how she looked! Suddenly her boobs were like two inches higher on her chest and all the flaws she'd been blaming on getting old/gaining weight/having kids just disappeared! The saleslady pointed out that because her old band size was so huge, it was causing everything to slide around and not fit right. She also explained the cup size (which was by far the most shocking part for my mom) by saying exactly what I'd said earlier, ""When you go down a band size you go up a cup size.""

The sad this is that just a few weeks ago my mom spent all her Christmas money on brand new bras, and now she's very aware of how poorly they all fit. :( But! I think in the long run this will be really good. And now she won't think I'm crazy or just picky when I reject nearly every single bra in the mall. 

So thank you guys so much for all that you've taught me! You've broken two generations of bad bra sizing in my family!

The wires on both were way too wide and the cups were slightly too large, but they fit so much better than what I was used to wearing.

The day after receiving those I saw good reviews on this subreddit for the Trousseau store in Northern Virginia, so I immediately went there, and it was an amazing experience!

I ended up getting the Chantelle C Chic Plunge (30G), Fantasie Ava (30FF), and Panache Sports (30F).  She checked the bands and although fitting well on the tightest hook now, she said they can do free alterations in the future to tighten the band if it loosens up.

* **Website First Impressions:** Underwhelming. They carry a very limited range of sizes (30 -38, A - F) &amp; the quiz asks completely irrelevant questions. Slightly discouraged, I persevered and answered their silly questions so I could see the goods.


* **""The Goods"":** My ""personal shop"" consisted of approximately 25 bras with some styles repeated in different colorways. When you click on a style there is information about sizing issues that users have reported. (ie. large band, small cups, etc.) Right out of the gate, they were offering me bras in sizes that, according to the reviews, would be too big for me. Getting ever more discouraged, I added a couple of bras to my ""try on box"" &amp; decided to retake the quiz to see if I could fudge the numbers enough to get selections that might suit me better. Lather, rinse, repeat... I ended up retaking the quiz about 6 times to finally arrive 3 selections that I thought might actually work. 

* **My selections:** I chose the Claudette Dessous in 38D &amp; 36DD in 2 different colorways and the Freya Deco Honey in 38D. I paid my $45 refundable try-on fee &amp; went on my merry way.

* **While I was waiting:** So, I ended up going to an amazing boutique nearby &amp; allowed one of their rad fitters to work her magic on me. Come to find out, I'm a 38E rather than the 38D / DD I thought I was. Apparently I had been trying on the wrong style bras for my shape. She even had me try on a Freya Deco, which did not work on me at all. Uh oh...

* **Today:** Ten days after placing my order, it finally arrived. Of course, having been properly fitted, I had zero expectation of anything actually working. Knowing that boobs &amp; bras can be somewhat fickle beasts, I tried everything on anyway. I will measure everything &amp; enter them all in to Bratabase later. Here they are (just the bras, not me in them): http://imgur.com/a/EZRJu

   * **1. Claudette Dessous (36DD) -** The band on this bra is *really* stretchy &amp; the wires run narrow. It's a pretty bra for ""sexy times"" but too scratchy for extended wear. This did not fit.

   * **2. Claudette Dessous (38D) -** see above

   * **3. Freya Deco Honey (38D) -** By some strange twist of fate, this bra actually fits. Not only does it fit, it fits me very well. The gore tacks, the band is nice and snug, the wires are perfect, &amp; the cups lay flat with no overspill or gapping. I love it &amp; it's a keeper!

   * **4. Parfait Charlotte (38E) -** First of 2 bras chosen by True. I wanted this bra to work *SO* bad! Unfortunately, it did not. The band fit tight but the gore would not tack. Too shallow in the bottom of the cup or just the style? The tops of the cups gapped no matter how much swooping, scooping, &amp; recombobulating I did. :(

   * **5. Freya Deco Convertible (38D) -** True's choice #2. Band was very snug but not uncomfortably so. Unfortunately, I experienced gapping at the tops of the cups despite this being ""too small"" in the cup size-wise. This is pretty typical for me with molded bras. I wanted this bra to work since it gives a really nice shape &amp; I like that you can adjust the width of the straps.

   * **Bonus! -** They included a free pair of underwear from Honeydew Intimates in my order. Too bad the bra they match did not fit. :P


In summary, True &amp; Co did not make any magic happen with their 2 selections but I would definitely use them again just to try out different styles. You can actually try on 10 bras for $45, not just 5. Sadly I did not realize this until after I submitted my order. If you fit in to their limited size range, I think it's worth checking out especially if you are on a budget. Hopefully they will expand their offerings to include more sizes soon.

I measured her at a 27 1/4 rib and a 30 1/2 at the bust. So I am thinking a 28 B/or/C. I am going today to a couple places to find her a more properly fitting bra. 

Here is where my rant starts. We are going to Justice first, so I checked their online bra selections for girls. Their measuring directions are terrible. Adding 5inches to the rib measurement? for a junior size?

I have a narrow root and I am either even or full on bottom depending on the time of the month. I've had a very hard time finding a bra for me because when I post looking for recommendations, I am automatically recommended bras for shallow sizes. Because of the quickness to assume all small sizes are shallow I thought I HAD to be shallow because I am small chested. My go-to bra, a 30D M&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;S plunge push-up, is my best fitting bra. I was very frustrated when I was returning so many recommended bras because they were too open at the top and gape. The ""balconettes"" that did fit me were closer in shape to plunges. Once I finally realized I did not fit the profile of shallow breasts, I started noticing just how quick most in here assume a small size is shallow. When a new measurement check or bra shopping help thread is posted and is below an 32F or so, every reply is talk of shallow, shallow, shallow. 

Yes, I do realize the majority of smaller sizes are shallow and directing new posters to the shape guide is very helpful, but I feel we should focus on asking them are you full on top, full on bottom, even, shallow, projected, ect rather than ""you are probably shallow here are the bras a shallow bust does best in"" This mantra is exactly what led me to buy and try so many bras in the wrong shape and become very frustrated. 

**TL;DR** instead of telling a small busted poster ""you are probably shallow, try bras X, Y, and Z"" instead ask ""here is a guide to all the shapes like FOB, FOT, even, shallow, projected which shape(s) fit you best?"" to avoid giving misleading advice.

Meme Mondays: We're expanding the definition of Meme to include pics of celebs wearing the wrong size/complaints about how celebs are in the wrong size (or claim to be a size they obviously aren't). This is because I have received a number of complaints about those posts, some people don't like them because they think it makes us sound like we're being mean to women that don't wear the right size and others are just tired of seeing them, this is a compromise so that they aren't gotten rid of entirely for the people that do like them.

I would like to say, detailed before and after posts are *really* appreciated and do a much better job of teaching people about fitting than the celeb pics do. Please post a before&amp;after with pictures if you are comfortable with sharing images of yourself =)

/r/lingerieaddiction : some of you may have missed it so as a reminder, all posts concerning lingerie that isn't specifically about bras (or at the very least *mostly* about bras) should be posted to other subreddits, namely /r/LingerieAddiction, or if you're looking for help with lingerie that fits and flatters your bust /r/smallboobproblems or /r/bigboobproblems, there's also /r/corsets and /r/corsetry for your corset needs.

This rule is mainly because I would really really really love to see /r/LingerieAddiction grow to its full potential (its really small right now) and that's not going to happen if all the good lingerie posts get put on our subreddit.

I mostly want this because I hate conflict, and bashing of different methods (that have both been shown to work), without thinking about what may or may not work on any individual, makes me feel uncomfortable.

A Small Rant.,youngbridget,42,4,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/1dphs5/really_disappointed_in_nordstrom_fitting/,"So, my wife and I went to Nordstrom today with the intent of having them fit us and trying on ALL THE BRAS.  She and I have very different boobs, by our measurements she is around a 30 GG or H, and I am around a 30 DD or 32 D (my rib cage is 30.5 and my breasts bending over are 35), but we thought the professionals might be able to fine tune.  

When I asked the fitter to measure me, she brought me in the dressing room and measured around my rib cage under my bra.  She measured very loosely! Then she said she would get the ""sizing bras"" and help  me narrow down the cup size.  She had me put on one (it was a betsy johnson with the vertical stripes) and turn around. No scooping &amp; swooping had occurred yet, but she looked at it and said, ""That looks good.""  I said, ""What size is this?"" She said, ""That is a 32 B.""

....

I pointed out that the wire was on my breast tissue, and she said, ""Well you can try a C, but I am concerned you won't fill up the cups.""  I tried on a bunch of Cs just to see if I am delusional, but when I scooped and swooped I was clearly bigger than that, if only slightly in some styles, and the wires were all all my breast tissue.  I could have been more pushy and insist that she bring me the size I measured myself, but I was so put off and was not ready to pull the trigger on anything today, so I just left.  

My wife had a slightly better experience with her fitter (who was the manager), but she was still told not to scoop and swoop (in fact, when my wife did the S&amp;S the fitter discouraged her and said, ""If you're going to do that you need to shake your breasts down in there so that it won't gap at the bottom""), and she also tried to put her in at least a cup size lower than she measured herself to be.

Next time I intend to not ask for any advice and just ask for a million styles in 30 DD and 32 D... but this is very frustrating.  Even at a nice place with a wide range of sizes like Nordstrom most women aren't going to walk out in the right size, especially if they are small chested like me.  It was clear the fitter I had didn't believe that someone small chested like me could have a larger cup size, and so if I hadn't measured myself I would have walked out in a 32 B.

I'll try and keep both up to date.)

Need a bra? Have a bra? is back for another year! Just like last year, I'll be giving away bras to any redditor who needs them. 

But we're running a bit different this year. I received a great donation of bras for this event from [the folks at Joye's intimates.]
(http://stores.ebay.com/Joyes-Intimates-and-More)  They're mostly bras that have little cosmetic flaws, looked a bit worn, or just didn't sell, but they're all in great, wearable condition. 

How it works: 
- If you want one of the bras I have listed, please send me a message with the bra you want  and your address. Please do this all in one message to make it easier for me to keep track of. 

- If you have bras you want to give away to a redditor who needs it, list your requirements and what bras you have. 

- If you don't see a bra in my listing or in anyone else's listing that would work for you, post  requesting your size and any particular bras you're looking for. 

My own rules for my bras: 

- You can't afford a bra. Buying a new bra would cut into your food, housing, childcare, or other essential expenses budget, or you just don't have the money at all. It's up to you to decide if you meet the spirit of this requirement, I don't need proof. 

- You have no good (properly fitting, or in good condition) bras, or only one. So you need a bra. 

- You live in the US. 

- You have an established reddit account (meaning you don't create a new account today to post the request.) 

- You know your size (ideally this means you've used the sizing guide on the sidebar to figure out your size.) Please also think about the style of bra you're requesting and if it will suit you.  If you're not sure, you might want to head into the store and try it on first. 

- If the bra you get doesn't end up fitting you and you decide not to wear it, please either donate it (whereever you wish) or use it to get yourself a different bra by posting to /r/braswap. 

You MUST send me your name and address and the bra you want. I cannot ship out a package without a name and your full address.

Again, if you want one of my bras, read the rules and send me a message with the bra and your name and address and I will respond if you were the first to request it. 

You MUST send me your name and address and the bra you want. I cannot ship out a package without a name and your full address.

If you have a bra to share, just go ahead and post it! 

If you need a bra, post a request! 

I hope that we can get lots of bras into good homes again this year. ",,False,,t5_2s8kf,1358133115.0,,,True,t3_16goxq,http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/16goxq/need_a_bra_have_a_bra_returns_again_this_year/,
1355015670.0,35,self.ABraThatFits,14ix1m,Frustrating day bra shopping. ,meritless,37,2,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/14ix1m/frustrating_day_bra_shopping/,"Last September I bought two bras from Lane Bryant after measuring myself using MyWifesBusty's guide and measured to a 38G, which was shocking, yet wonderful because I knew for years that my bras did not fit, even though I had been mistreating my poor boobs into 38C's and 38D's since the 7th grade. Yikes. Anyway, because my breasts are pendulous, I took an average leaning over and standing up and that brought me to a 38F. After trying on bras at Lane Bryant, I found that in a t-shirt bra, My breasts did not fill the 38F, but were perfect in the 38DDD. 

Fast forward to a few months later and I'm popping out of my bra. Not only am I quad-boobing, but the gore no longer was right against my chest. So, I decided today with a bit extra money I'd go back to Lane Bryant and try on some 38F's and 38G's. 

I go in and suddenly everyone wants to measure me. I told them I knew my measurements, that I had been measured and that I was currently wearing one of their bras in a 38DDD, but was popping out of the cups. When I asked an associate to help me find some of the bras I was looking for, she took the 38G from me and told me that I did not look *that big*. She then held the bra up to my breast and told me not to try that one. I shook that off. I went and tried the bras on, and I found the 38F fit better, but I wasn't feeling the full coverage, so I continued looking. 

I was in the store for about an hour but I didn't really find anything that suited me. At the check-out counter (I bought some adorable shoes instead), another woman asked me if the bras worked out for me. I told her the truth; I was currently wearing a 38DDD, but I was popping out the cups and needed a 38F but they didn't have any models in store that I liked in that size. She immediately had this look on her face of disgust and stared at my chest and told me that there was no way that I was a 38DDD. 

I was wearing their bra for gosh sakes. I know what size it is. 

I found it incredibly rude, especially after she continued asking questions about the bras I wasn't interested in buy. She told me that I should have gone up in band size instead of cup size, but I assured her that I was a 38. 

After that I went into Torrid, just to see if they had any bras in my size (I was going to try on a 40DDD in their strapless bra, because it's a sister size to the 38F) and I was met again with the associate staring at my breasts, telling me that there was no way I was wearing a 38DDD because it looked like we were the same size. She told me that she wanted to measure me. I told her she was free to do so, but I knew what bra I was wearing, and that my entire breast was not fitting into either of the cups. 

Then the associates tried to get me into a 40DD (which makes no sense since they had just told me that I wasn't a 38DDD, yet was being told to try on a sister size.)

I'm just frustrated. I don't feel like my breasts are giant, nor do I think they're small. They're just mine, and if I'm going to spend my money on something, I want it to fit. 

So I think I'm going to make an order on brastop soon. Wish me luck!",,False,,t5_2s8kf,False,,,True,t3_14ix1m,http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/14ix1m/frustrating_day_bra_shopping/,

I love my girlfriend dearly, but since the first time I removed her bra - I thought there wasn't something quite right.  Granted, by no means am I a pro at boobs, but her breasts were just kinda sitting in there.

Fast forward a year.  I want to buy my gf something nice for her birthday... maybe something useful.  Thought about a dress, shoes, etc... but I really do think she could use a nice bra.  (Idea would be to get her fitted, cause having her seek professional help is near to impossible.  Then maybe give her a gift card to get a good bra or two)

Before, I get my head removed - I want something that *fits* her, and if it happens to be another color than a Hanes beige bra (only ones she has), then its a win-win.

**My problems**

- She doesn't think her bra fits poorly.  Well I really do disagree... gaping cups and no lift.  Asked her if she got fitted, and she didn't think you had to.  Rather you just find something that fits?

- Asked her this morning if I can take her to the mall for a fitting.  She says shes afraid of being put into a A cup (currently a 34B).  Told her that a fit is better than a number, and that I like her boobs just fine.

**My Questions**

1) How can I convince her to get fitted? - I really don't mind paying for a couple of bras or a fitting...

2) Will there be massive tears if a A cup is involved?  How to mitigate this?

3) Where do you suggest for a fitting?  I read that VS is shitty but Nordstrom is good?  (I am in New Haven, CT 06510)

4) Anything else to know?  Or should I keep my head in my own business?

Initially I was concerned that the smaller band size would be uncomfortable, but so far it is a non-issue.  The straps stay comfortably in place and I don't have to constantly readjust the cups. I never knew a bra could actually be comfortable.

I used to think the reason bra bands were so loose was so that you could pull it far away to air out boob sweat.
One used to think that the number in front of the letter indicated the ""level"" you were at in that cupsize-- such that if your boobs grew a little, you went from a 32C to a 34C, and after you attained a certain ""boob level"" you got to go up a cupsize, so like go from a 44D to a 32DD.

I was thinking of putting a survey together which would ask what brands have you tried (example: nubra), which models (example: original or feather-lite), what size in the backless bra do you wear (example: b-cup), and what your actual bra size is based on the measuring system here (example: UK 30G) and then making a google doc spreadsheet of it, so that it could be easier for others to try to figure out what size they would need.

Again, sorry for the length, skip to the last paragraph and take the survey if you do not want to read this whole thing, it is very important I get your feedback on the proposed rules.


First, I would like to thank /u/cleverdistraction our new mod in charge of the sidebar and wiki and CSS. Please check out the wiki if you haven't already, you can access it by clicking the ""wiki"" tab in the top banner between the ""saved"" and ""view images"" tabs. Please also review the sidebar links, some of them are different, even if they look similar. /u/cleverdistraction has done a lot of hard work and has made our subreddit a lot easier to navigate and use so please give her a round of applause and a lot of thank you's she deserves it! =)

Another big thanks goes out to /u/chromecoat a wonderful fellow that got involved in this subreddit to help his wife and was kind enough to make us the amazingly wonderful [how to measure](http://i.imgur.com/k6P94Bt.png) and breast shape graphics (someone link this to me in the comments so I can edit it in I seem to have lost the link)! 


Thanks also to /u/ankylosaurus_rex for her shallow breast guide and /u/shaytom for her all-in-one guide! =) If you made a big contribution to our subreddit since my last mod post and I forgot to mention it, speak up! You deserve recognition. =)


Alright, now down to business. I tired to put together a weekly post called Friday Gripe Day (I wanted something that rhymed, sorry, I know it sounds stupid!) where you would post all the bras you wish you could buy but can't due to your size, unfortunately life got away from me and I haven't done it the past couple weeks (though /u/t_maia was kind enough to take over one of those weeks and post it for me! thanks a bunch!) I would like to continue with that but I think I may make it a monthly post instead. 


We will however be starting a *new* weekly thread idea next week! A user (forgot your name, sorry!) requested a weekly thread for small questions/comments that aren't really big enough to make your own post about, and i thought that was a great idea so we're going through with it. Suggestions for what day to do it on will be appreciated. 


Now the big stuff, proposed new rules: No gifs, No memes, no other pointless posts that do not really contribute to discussion/knowledge sharing/aren't asking for help (essentially, if you could make the same post in meme or gif format don't post it). I would include things like busty girl problems comics or other similar things like that (it involves bras, likely to be relatable, likely to get lots of upvotes, but not really benefiting our subreddit in any way) as well. If you want to make a post and the comic/meme/gif is relevant please feel free include it but don't expect it to stand up by itself as good content. I was thinking the small questions/comments thread would be an ok place for that but I'm worried it will get over crowded with that kind of thing and that the more important stuff will get looked over. We could perhaps have a separate thread if you feel like this subreddit would be loosing out by getting rid of those things entirely? What are your thoughts?


I am also thinking about including the posts about VS in this new rule but this is a touchier subject so I'm *very* dubious about it. It would not be posts that have legitimate complaints/praises about a specific expirience but rather the general ""I don't like VS""/""I don't like the way VS is treated on this sub"" posts because at this point they are not contributing anything to our subreddit anymore and a lot of people are getting annoyed with them. I don't really want to have to enforce these new rules but it is starting to look like the content of our subreddit is suffering so if enough people want them I will make them official rules. 


Another new rule (this one isn't proposed, it is already an official rule): *NO DRAMA*. Not much different than ""don't be a jerk"", but a lot of times when drama is started you aren't intending to be a jerk. This has actually been in place for a long time unofficially, the way it goes is if you're causing problems but without the intent of being mean/acting like a pervert expect to get a warning from me, I will tag you showing that you've received a warning so that I can keep track, if you receive 2-3 warnings you will be banned. Normally this is all the action I will take, but in certain rare circumstances where I feel like the post or comment is going to cause a *lot* of problems, I may remove it, though oftentimes I just let it take its course. So please be considerate when you are posting and commenting, if you end up becoming involved in an argument let it go, don't escalate it.


Additional stuff:

* The Bratabase Breast shapes project still needs our help http://www.bratabase.com/pages/Shapes/submit/

* The Bra Band Project also still needs our help http://www.brabandproject.com/

* If there are any other projects currently going on in the bra fitting community please tell me I'll add them to this list! =)


Please give feedback on the monthly/weekly posts and the proposed rules, I am not a mind reader and if you are dissatisfied with something or think something could be done better in a different way I will not know if you don't speak up. I have made a survey monkey survey for anyone that wants to give feedback anonymously, there are 5 questions you have to answer (don't worry, there is a ""I don't care"" option for each) and an optional comments box at the end if you feel you have something you want to say that was not addressed by answering the questions. http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/XFDZPNB I want this place to be as enjoyable for as many people as I can make it so please contribute. =)

edit: I'll respond to some of the comments in the survey in the comments here, and that way people can add their opinions.

edit#2: I forgot one of the news rules I was going to instigate! sorry. Request for help looking for any lingerie that isn't bras go to /r/LingerieAddiction. If you need help finding something that flatters a small chest or big chest specifically /r/smallboobproblems or /r/bigboobproblems are good places to post. /r/corsets or /r/corsetry are good places if you're looking for help with corsets.

&gt;When I find an interesting subject, I tend too dive right in and read everything I can on the subject, and I have the feeling that many of the success stories here are the same. But we need to remember that some people, maybe even most, don't want to spend time reading up on stuff. They want a simple guide that includes all necessary information, that is easily digestible, and that works on the first try.

And she's so right! I spent weeks reading through pretty much every post, reading the MWB fitting guide and other resources, and didn't even feel the need to make a post to ask for my size because I felt like I understood it all pretty well. But there are plenty of women out there who aren't quite as enthusiastic, or it just isn't in their nature to do quite so much research. I see plenty of posts where all they say is ""Here are my measurements, what's my size?"" and I'm over here like... did you read the fitting guide? Not that it's a bad thing that they are posting, but maybe we have too much information in too many different places where they feel overwhelmed.

I know that the mods are trying to rearrange the sidebar and make a wiki and what not which I think will be great, but these women who don't like to research may not be into reading an entire wiki either. Therefore, I propose an All-In-One Fitting Guide/Starting Place. One link that takes you to one infographic type thing, with step by step instructions on what measurements to take, how to calculate your size, and frequent issues that I find myself repeating quite a lot (+2 for smaller girls, try on the bra backwards, just a starting point so try on a variety of sizes, etc.).

Now I don't know how much interest there is in this, but [I've gotten something started](http://imgur.com/7FUNvju) so you can see what I mean and y'all can let me know if you think this is something that could be useful.

Unfortunately, it needs a lot of work! I do not feel nearly comfortable enough coming up with instructions for those on the opposite end of the spectrum from me, so hopefully one or more of you can chime in with that. Along the same lines, I wasn't sure if I should split up the guide into smaller vs. larger band sizes or if it was more accurate to do the different measurements for smaller vs. larger cup sizes. Does that make sense? Like I know that the different ends of the spectrum need different methods, but is the spectrum based more on band size or cup size? Also, I would love some input on what common tidbits you all find yourself sharing with newbies that we can throw in here in addition to what I already have. Maybe even an FAQ at the end? Who knows!

Please let me know if this sounds like it would be helpful and what all you think should be included!

When I saw their [Paige Italian Lace DD+ Balconette Bra](http://www.figleaves.com/us/product/FIG-123101/Midnight-Grace-by-figleaves.com-Paige-Italian-Lace-DD-Balconette-Bra/?size=&amp;colour=Lilac/Purples), though, I decided to take the risk and order it anyway. With their 20% off sale, it was only about $31, so not a huge risk if I hated it.

Just got the bra today and I thought I'd share some pictures/thoughts for anyone else who might be curious.

Construction: Quality. Most of the bra is made from a mesh, similar to what the Cleo Marcie/Lucy bras are made from. Everything feels sturdy. No itchiness or poking on my sensitive skin. Some loose ends of threads stick out, but I see that on a lot of brand-name bras, so I won't hold it against them.

Fit: It's perfect for me, but it's on the tight side for a 30-band. Band stretches out to 30 inches. If you prefer to size up in Cleos or Ewas, you may want to size up for this line of bras. One huge plus for me is the narrow cups. I measured these cups to be about .25 cm narrower than my similarly sized Ewas.

Appearance: Very pretty! From the front, it looks just like the picture on their website. Not quite as rounded as the Marcie makes me look, but definitely not overly pointy. My only complaint is that the lace overlay, not being as tight as the underlying mesh, looks a little wrinkly in some areas. From the side, it kind of looks like the bra doesn't fit and is really pointy, but it's just because the lace isn't lying flat against the cups. This is not visible under a shirt.

[Pictures!](http://imgur.com/a/Vh1WN)

My measurements, for reference: 27.5'' under, 37'' over.

I've heard their different lines are made by different manufacturers, so I can't say that the Just Peachy or Essentials line is similar, but I would definitely buy another Midnight Grace bra in the future.",,True,,t5_2s8kf,False,,,True,t3_1cwpdj,http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/1cwpdj/figleaves_house_brand_success_review_pics_of_30ff/,

In the comments, there seemed to be a lot of people who thought a separate, user-friendly website would be a useful tool (rather than the old Flickr album). So, the Mr. and I decided to make it so! I therefore present to you:

[**The Bra Band Project Project Website**](http://www.brabandproject.com/) [nsfw, some women in bras]

I plan to post more about this on the blog come tomorrow, but since you guys are so awesome (and encouraged us to dust off the website work we had done in the past), you get the first peek/opportunity to test it out :)

You'll notice that the submissions so far are nearly all 24-30 band women; this is because so far, they're nearly all pictures that have been moved over from the old Flickr album. So, to make this the best resource possible, **we need more submissions!** If you're wearing your correct bra size, please don't hesitate to try out the login/submit feature on the website! Pictures are completely anonymous, and you can submit a clothed picture rather than one in lingerie if you prefer.

Feedback? Thoughts? Questions? Let me know!

Edit - if any mods see this, would they mind replacing the link in the sidebar (from the old Flickr album to the new website)? 

**Edit**: I suppose I really should've made it more clear that the website is very much in the beginning stages - a ""first draft"", if you will! All the feedback is most definitely appreciated.

I carried most of my weight in my face, boobs, and stomach, so I was all cheeks and boobs.  At the time I wore a 44DDD, but I'm sure that was not an accurate size.  It's hard to say at this point.

Anyway, I lost around 85 pounds.  I'm currently wearing a 34DDD, but my band is gigantic and I'm quadboobing up the wazoo.  Based on my measurements and MWB's guide, I'm looking at around a 32J (US), but but I'm hoping that I won't need a cup size that large.  (I'm hitting up Nordstrom this weekend when I visit family that live near one, as I live in a big bra desert-- not even the specialty lingerie stores carry my size here.  So we'll see.)  My last properly fitting bra a bit of weight ago was a 36H (US), so i'm vaguely irritated that I may have to go up in my cup size again.  Anyway, it's a huge pain in the ass, like bra shopping has always been for me.

So imagine my surprise when on two separate occasions, two groups of friends have decided to chat about how small my boobs are and how big they used to be.  Yeah, they used to have a bigger volume.  I was OBESE, and now I'm not.  But the more weight I lose, the bigger my cup size gets.  It's more of a pain in the ass for me than ever.  And besides, *how is that even an appropriate conversation topic anyway?*  I get my shit together and finally get healthy and we're focused on how my tits are smaller?  This is coming from male friends and female friends alike.  I was a little drunk the first time, so I let it slide, and the second time I was frankly just shocked that it happened again.

Brastop decided to have a 60% off sale and I went for it.  **I ordered the Curvy Kate Angel Balconette and Gossard Wild Print Plunge in Purple both in 32G.**  
**""Wow!""**  Was my reaction to seeing the 2 gorgeous boobs hammocks.  I thought, *""The cup is too big/No way in hell/Pffft...crazy bra talk...""*  Tried them on for fun....and nope.  They fit!  I had **NEVER BEEN SO EXCITED**.  The band felt a bit tight but not bad since I was only using a 34 beforehand and thought I'd get used to it like I have with other bras.  After and hour of wearing it, I feel pretty comfortable and my breasts feel amazing!  
*After I finally picked up my jaw from the floor*, I called my mom to tell her I was a 32G and I began to explain how it lead to the new bra size, how I was quadboobing and always having to readjust my knockers.  I prepared myself for the whole *""That's crazy.  Your boobs aren't that big. You're dumb.* nonsense.....surprisingly, I didn't hear it.  She told me I had to tell her how I found out my size, to send her photos my myself in my bra, and how she can get new bras herself(I inherited the huge boob gene from her).  She's amazing and has such an open mind.  I love her!
After she got my photos, she congratulated me on my new boob hammocks(she calls them that), and that she needs new bras now cause she tired of quadboobing all the time.   Lol!

*So there you go ABTFs!  You finally made a believer out of me and now I've made a believer of my dear Mama!  I will be calling her later on this week to tell her how to measure herself(I can't direct her here, she only speaks spanish) so we can get to ordering her new and well-fitting bras!!!*

I'll apologise now for the image quality!

So here are my [boobs](http://imgur.com/a/tjSPX). I think I have a wide root and shallow breast, I don't have very much projection, but I measure up with a 26"" underbust and a 31"" bust.

[Here](http://imgur.com/a/zlXNO) is my favourite pre /r/abrathatfits bra. It is a 34B, and actually fits a lot better than all the 34As that I threw out.

This is a [30D from Bras n' Things](http://imgur.com/a/Bv107), my first actual bra measuring up in a shop. It's ridiculously comfy but still a bit gapey and not a small enough band.

I got this [Freya 30D](http://imgur.com/a/RtGHH) bra from brastop.com. It isn't a moulded cup which weirds me out a bit. It is more of a ""sexy"" bra than anything else. I much prefer moulded cups. But I think it fits alrightish.

Okay, this [Panache 28D](http://imgur.com/a/DF2Hk) is a bit shocking, but it is the only strapless bra that doesn't slip down. I do not fill it out at all. The quest for the strapless bra continues!


And this [Curvy Kate 28D](http://imgur.com/a/hoOP2) is probably the best bra I own. The wires are a bit narrow, but it gives me almost cleavage. I can't stop looking down my shirt, I've never had anything resembling cleavage before in my life.

So where to from here? I have 3 of the Bras n' Things bras and the Curvy Kate, which are the only ones I wear on a regular basis. I'd love some advice on shapes and styles to look for. I do have to note that I can't wear anything too high in the gore because it pokes me in the sternum and hurts a lot.

I had gone into VS and they measured me as a 36DD but those even seemed too small when I tried them on. 

After that visit, I was was so bummed out about my boobs. They always looked sad and droopy, and I wanted them gone. I found a compression bra that made them look much smaller and it made me happy....up until I started realizing that the pooches in my arm pits were getting larger. That's about the time I stumbled upon this subreddit and learned about tissue migration. I.was.horrified.

That's when I started reading different posts about others who had been wearing terribly fitting bras and found their perfect fit. I was totally jealous about how good everyone's chest looked in their after pictures. 

I took things slow. I measured myself using the instructions in the side bar and was shocked at the results. They couldn't be right. I must have done something wrong. At this point, I knew that even if I did something wrong, the 36C I was wearing was not going to cut it anymore. 

I found a place near where I live that sells international brands and is not so much focused on fitting you into a particular size as it is finding the correct bra to fit you. It was a great experience. When I checked the bra size of the one's that fit, it ended up being the same size that I had measured myself at! I guess I just couldn't handle the truth before.

Although, I probably will never be able to post before and after pics of myself, I just wanted to say thank you all for showing me a proper fit and the confidence that it can bring.

However, other users may be visiting at other times, and I want to provide a place that other women can request sizes/brands/styles **and** view requests from other /r/abrathatfits users. 

After much brainstorming, I've come up with a form and a resulting spreadsheet. It isn't PERFECT, but what is?

**FOR REQUESTING**

* [Take this request form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1-kqpPXC-3bvHl_IKxsq_lmtzCemFDChDIsNoau1jgRY/viewform). This will give your information in a concise way that is easy to view for others. Be sure to be as concise as possible!
* Please read the instructions at the top and save the link! This way, you can edit if your request has been fulfilled by someone (I.E. they found you a pretty, new bra!)
* Once you've been contacted about a bra and your request has been fulfilled, re-visit that link and edit your response to **yes, your request has been fulfilled by someone awesome.** This helps us all!


**FOR WOMEN WHO WANT TO HELP SHOP**

* [Here is the public spreadsheet with requests](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aop0gwIKck6mdEF0MklpemxXQ3VLV3FYcE1JQU95ZHc&amp;usp=sharing). I've tried to make this all as easy as possible to read. Say, you've found a 30H that needs a good home. Simply go to this spreadsheet and find a user who is requesting a 30H that fits the bill. **PM them via Reddit with a photo of the bra as well as a piece of paper with your username written on it to let them know you have a bra for them (this lets us all know you're legit, yo).** 
* I suggest using PayPal invoices to ship. This is safest for you, the seller, and them, the buyer. It also allows you to PRINT labels at home for your package, assuming you can weigh it, and sends them a tracking number via email automatically.

**OTHER BITS**

* If the form breaks or something is missing, feel free to PM me or /u/dresdenologist, who has helped me come up with this handy, snazzy thing.

Edit: So I derped and didn't set up the edit properly. Now when you finish the request, it will take you to the ""Thanks!"" page and say: ""Optional: Edit your response."" Click on that link. That is the edit link you want.

/u/otterhugs has tipped me off that Aerie has 30A's online (certain styles only).

I tried on at least 10-12 bras and 5-6 bathing suit tops.

I had an excellent trip and was able to find 4 bras and 2 swimsuits that fit beautifully. **Prices were $29-$39** for bras and swimsuit tops. They do carry 28 - 48/50/52 bands, cup size up to a K (UK). 

This store is a 2 hour drive from where I live, but well worth the trip as I had plenty to try on and figure out my size. I was between a 30-32 G/GG/H and was able to narrow it down that most 30GG or 30H will fit. Once I was in the fitting room, the very knowledgeable associate brought bras to me. I never had the chance to really browse the bras as they helped me out immediately. 

Their stock varies week to week, so if you have an unusual bra size (28 or 48/50/52 band) - it may be best to call first to see what's in stock before making the trip. 

They are not allowed to advertise but they do have a Facebook page and a website.

I have shallow breasts. They're also full on top. And close together. With a concave space between. They don't go under my arms at all-- they're quite forward pointing. With highset nipples. And it's rather dense breast tissue, in rather perky boobs. There's no drooping, at all. I can't get cups to fit. E is too small, and F is too big. E leaves me quadboobing, but F cups wrinkle.

I've tried Curvy Kate (that was just a disaster all around), Cleo Jude, Figleaves Essentials, Figleaves Boudoir, and Panache Tango.

I did manage to get a bra from a similarly sized friend-- a Panache sports bra in 28F that had been stretched out (it was used). I'd like to think I can actually get new bras, and don't have to scrounge used ones from friends...

One thing I can suggest is if you frequent blogs or read a lot of reviews, take what everyone has to say with a grain of salt because **everyone has a different breast SHAPE which can interfere with sizing.** For example, if two women are looking at the same bra with a tigher upper section, (which quite a few balcony bras have) the woman with breasts that are **fuller on top** may have to size up more often than the woman who is **fuller on the bottom.** 
This means that some bras that you hear may ""run small"" or ""have a pointy shape when they are too small in the cup"" may only be like this for women who are fuller on top, and will remain true to size for women who are fuller on the bottom.  
This is just my experience with bra shopping.  I try to start small even when I hear that a bra may run small in the cup because I am fuller on the bottom.

In my self measurements I came to a 30E, Von Maur got me at a 30D, and La Bratique sized me as a 30E.

At La Bratique I tried on several different bras (mostly Panache and Chantelle brands).  I came up fitting into a 30D, 30E, and 30DD depending upon the fabric, amount of elasticity, and brand.  It even varied within the same brand.  

I was absolutely baffled.  I thought I could know my size and just buy it online, but fabric is such an important factor.  In t-shirt bras it was one size, in silk another size.  

I just wanted to emphasize how important it is to talk to someone who's sole business is bras.  The woman who owned the shop taught me everything about how a bra should fit, things I never would have noticed without her.  

I can't afford the bras she sells, but now if I buy them online, I'll probably just buy two of the same in both sizes to see which one works.

I am not here because of any kinks or fetishes, I am here because I 'do computers' and am tired of my chest sitting on my stomach, and hiking is annoying after a fast-paced several mile trek. 

For obvious reasons, am too ashamed to go anywhere to get fitted. 

I had a lesbian friend of mine (only one who I can trust to have discretion) help with measurements. She has been trying to talk me into getting fitted for some time, and I decided it was time to take that advice. I refuse to go to any brick and mortar stores for a fitting. I'd rather get a little aid in sizing, and try online. Obviously, I have never worn bras before. 

Using the guides, my measurements...

* Underbust, comfortable, ~41 1/2in
* Underbust, tight, ~40in
* Upright, ~47 1/2in
* Bending forward, ~50 1/2in
* On back, ~46 1/4in
* [Shape](http://i.imgur.com/zeP3dZF.png), 1-2/5 (please don't request pictures)
* Width, tissue is parted about 1in on chest, nipples part about 12in, M shape
* Height, 73in

She said you're supposed to measure with slight impression on breasts, so if 'no distortion of breast tissue' means 'no distortion past the nipple', then add about 1/2in to the above measurements, or closer to 1in if you aren't supposed to distort nipple tissue either. 

Also, after getting an idea what I might need to look for, any suggestions on something that would be comfortable and less-noticeable? All I care about is something comfortable, so I stop getting a rash where breasts rub. I'm not in a position where I interact with a lot of people, and my friend tells me a fitted bra is better than a sports bra in comfort level, so I'll leave that up to you all.

Here's my quick bg: I measured a 32C from VS before I had my son (he's 2 now). My breasts were bigger for about the first year or so after he was born (only BF for 5 weeks) but recently I felt like they shrunk (major gaping at the tops of my usual madenform bras). 

Disappointed, I finally went back to VS to get measured again (that was before finding this subreddit!). They still measured me at a 32C, and I found bras that fit me SO much better. 

Now after finding this form ive realized VS isn't Always the most reliable, and their bras not always the best (and ugh I bought 4 of them!! $$). According to the measurement guide I'm a 26 E/F :( also according to one of the links provided in the sidebar a size 26 band usually = custom. I REALLY don't want to order custom bras. Good news is 32C seems to be a sister size, although its a few sizes away on the chart. 

Can someone do a fit check for me? I forget the style VS I got, something that's ""lightly lined."" I know the strap is more stretchy than 2"" but it's also much tighter than what I was wearing. They feel fairly comfortable.

TIA!

My ""default"" measurement is 28G, but since I heard bands and cups can run small in Ewas, I went with 30G. I *could* go for a 28GG, but I don't feel like doing a custom order, and this one fits well enough that I'm not concerned. I don't have much padding on my ribcage, so it still feels pretty snug to me!

Just figured I'd post these pictures comparing it to an old, ill-fitting Victoria's Secret bra. Mainly because the difference made me laugh! No really, when I tried on the new one, then put on the old one just to see, I laughed at the mirror.

In reality, the spillage/quadboob in the VS is much worse than it appears; I just wasn't prepared to post horrendous nip-slips! Haha. Well... more like a total boob jailbreak, tbh. I partially reversed the scoop-and-swoop and squished back into the cups to spare you. The gore doesn't tack and instead hovers uselessly over my cleavage, the wires rest on sideboob, band rides up... it supports nothing and is more like a boob-compressing sling than a bra. The band is stupidly loose, but my boobs are squished to look flatter/wider than they are because the cups are too small. What a shittastic fit.

The Ewa Michalak, however, pleases me! The gore, for once, is low enough that it doesn't stab or hurt my close-set boobs, yet feels supportive. (What is this sorcery?) The wires are either just the right width or very near it, not resting on anything, and they fit right up under my boobs. Instead of compressing, the cups encompass everything and suit my projection-y shape, so I somehow look both bustier and a few pounds lighter??? what, how

Mostly this bra is a godsend to me for the low gore.  I've tried on so many, but this one is just right. I just can't fathom how I ever thought the VS bra was a good fit! Just... how could someone look at that and tell me that's how it's supposed to fit?  D:

1369081635.0,30,self.ABraThatFits,1epsix,Alteration Report - I am now the proud owner of a 28GG Freya Ivy longline with racerback straps.,leedlebug,38,8,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/1epsix/alteration_report_i_am_now_the_proud_owner_of_a/,"Pictures of alteration: http://imgur.com/a/F69Eb

A while ago I shared my frustrations about the lack of racerback/multiway and longline bras in my size (28GG/H). A few weeks ago, I traded on /r/braswap for a Freya Ivy longline in 30G - the cups on this model were said to run a little bigger than some of the other Freya longlines, so I hoped I might be able to either wear it on the smallest hook, or alter it by adding a stiff ribbon to control stretch.

When I received the Ivy, I was relieved to discover the cups were the perfect size. The band, on the other hand, stretched to over 33' - it's unstretched measurement was only slightly smaller than my ribcage. It provided no support, even on the smallest hook.

The 30G Ivy had a 2"" panel on each side made of a non-stretch fabric. By folding it over end-to-end, I shortened the band by 1.5"" on each side. I sewed it folded flat with some very messy chained handstitching (the green stitching in the picture, but this left a very thick triple-layered fold along the band, so I notched the band and sewed that flat (the red stitching).

Once this alteration was complete, the bra became quite wearable. However, because the length had been taken out of the sides, the bra straps were positioned a little bit further out than on the average 28GG. Rather than move them closer in, I decided this was the perfect opportunity to test altering it into a racerback configuration. This was also a great success (ignore the wonky way I did up the hooks in the racerback picture - taking a bra on and off quickly for pictures led to some...interesting hook arrangements).

I now own a well-fitted approximation of a racer-backed longline bra in a 28GG. Given this success, I feel confident I can alter a 30G Freya Deco longline for my strapless and multiway needs.

I've also decided to make this bra my ground zero for future test alterations. Next, I want to narrow the gore (it is a little too wide, and the band could afford to be a little tighter than it is, even post alterations. I also want to add a band stiffener of some kind (maybe a thick bias tape? along the bottom flange of the longline, to help control the crumpling and folding that happens.

NOTE:  In the pictures, I am wearing the bra a little too low, with the straps loosened all the way.  I had them loosened for easier sewing, and then was in such a hurry to photograph my success that I didn't adjust them.  This explains some of the crumpling in the cups (also contributing is the fact that my right boob is smaller and higher set than my left, so there's always some empty space at the bottom of that cup)  I do actually know that my bra belongs a little bit higher.",,False,,t5_2s8kf,1369084896.0,,,True,t3_1epsix,http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/1epsix/alteration_report_i_am_now_the_proud_owner_of_a/,

My most recent incorrect fitting at Victoria's Secret put me in a 36DD about a year ago. I started reading r/abrathatfits and realized my bras weren't fitting right. At all. I could pull the band 3-4"" from my body, my breasts didn't fit all the way in the cups, and the gore was a good 3/4"" off my chest. I always felt that many bras in many stores were either too small or looked very matornly for someone in my size. Maybe I was just too big and too busty to have pretty bras, I often thought.

I did the MWB calculator and knew my size was either a 32-34/F-G-H and crossed my fingers that a bra fitter would be in that range. Fast forward to today, where I was fed up of having a poorly fitting bra. I went to Intimacy in Tyson's Corner in northern VA/DC area and met Allison. My bra wizard. She was friendly and easy to talk to. We went into the fitting room, she took a look at the fit problems with my current bra and, through some sort of bra fitting sorcery, pulled a bra for me to try. There I was, in a bra with grey lace and yellow flowers, that FIT. A 32G. THAT FIT.

Ladies, *I nearly cried.* Never ever did I think I'd fit into a sexy bra that made my breasts look amazing and that wasn't crazy expensive. I left with a [Simone Perele Amour in fuschia](http://www.simoneperele.com/collections-amour/c3_96/p288/amour-full-cup/product_info.html) and a [Chantelle Rive Gauche in Cappucino] (http://www.figleaves.com/us/product/CN-3281/Chantelle-Rive-Gauche-3-Section-Full-Cup-Bra/?size=&amp;colour=Black) after trying on about 15 bras. They even had a trampoline in one of the dressing rooms so I could bounce around in a sports bra to see how much different the support made.

Without you ABTF, I don't know that I would have found the right size for me in bras or gained the confidence that many big box stores, misfittings, and snide remarks about a busty young teenager had ripped away so long ago. I feel so sexy and so pretty and SO HAPPY!

I got tired of buying online and returning bras that didn't work over and over again, so on the recommendation of a friend I went to [A La Folie](http://stores.homestead.com/visitalafolie/StoreFront.bok) in Oakland today for a bra fitting. I was a little worried because when I called to schedule the appointment and make sure they carried my estimated size the fitter seemed a little flustered, but it went well! 

It's a tiny shop that's appointment-only except on Saturdays, and they fit you not by taking measurements, but by starting with your current size or estimate, seeing how it fits (or doesn't), and going from there. There's a $25 fitting fee for new customers, waived if you make a purchase. The fitter I dealt with seemed to know her stuff pretty well, and was careful to make sure my underwire was in the right place under my breasts, that I'd properly scooped-and-swooped, that the gore tacked, and that the straps were properly adjusted. I went in wearing a 40G I knew didn't fit, thought I was probably a 38H, and when she saw how poorly that fit, she immediately brought me 36 and 38 Is and Js to try. Eventually we got me into a 36JJ that fit perfectly! She did only have a couple bras in that size, but we sat down with catalogs after to order more styles for me to try on when they come in, and she was willing to order different sizes and colors of the ones I was interested in just in case we needed to go with a sister size.

So if you're in the Bay Area and need A Bra That Fits, I recommend A La Folie! They carry a few other brands than just the ones listed on the site, including Elomi and Fantasie, and they're willing to order.

I also have a fitting scheduled with Carol Doda (yes, *that* Carol Doda) in San Francisco next week, since I wasn't sure how this one would go and I wanted to have options. I'm still going to go, in hopes that she has a better selection. I'll report back on that one, too!

1365260348.0,31,self.ABraThatFits,1bsqbe,A huge thankyou to ABTF!,messyblonde,39,8,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/1bsqbe/a_huge_thankyou_to_abtf/,"My 10-year old self once thought that she'd have these amazing boobs by the time she was 18 since they had started growing quite young. I'd lost my mum when I was 8 so it was left to my dad and female relatives to help me through female 'stuff'. At 13, I was bought a 32A bra, which wouldn't actually do up without being incredibly tight, so I was a 34A instead. They must have stopped growing at about this age and still look much the same now at 21. I hit 5""7/8 young and have remained 130-136pounds ever since, so although I'm not skinny, I'm not fat.  

I have always hated my abnormal, unsymmetrical breasts. They are incredibly triangular, almost pre-pubescent, where your nipple and areola grows outwards but still they had no substance/fullness to them, looked very deflated and certainly never rounded out. My puffy areolas seemed huge in comparison to the rest of me (sadface), and my very tight quad muscles made my spinal posture awkward and my bottom ribs stick out a lot. My bf of 2.5years is the only person/guy I have ever allowed to see me without a bra on, which was a massive feat for me, although I'm still not comfortable with the lights on, and I refuse to walk around (dark or not), which is a truly horrible feeling.

A year ago, online bra-size calculators where they ask you for three measurements, below, around and above, still gave me a 34A but all my 34As just seemed too small and I'd always be poking out of the top. Debenhams human-fitters gave me 34B which I was super happy with, however after a while, I found I would fall out of the cups if I laid on my side and my nips would show out of the cup occasionally. I definitely wasn't a C cup due to my lack of substance, but I still didn't back fit into my old A's.

I was stumped and very disheartened as I put it down to my silly and unusual shape, and figured I must just put up with it. I searched through the [007b](http://www.007b.com/breast_gallery.php) website but none seemed quite like mine, although the 13th one on the first page look slightly similar, except mine are less rounded from both the top view and sides. 

I found this subreddit a few weeks ago and have since, with the help of all your lovely links and fitting pictures, realised that I had wrongly put my trust in old methods for too many years and I should venture out of my familiar 34 territory. I ventured into Debenhams again and picked a much younger, newer girl and properly explained my problems and realisations. I tried a 32C which I found gave me crazy quad boob, then a 32D which fitted perfectly! I couldn't quite believe it, and she checked everything and agreed it fitted great. I was so happy to finally have a bra which properly fits, which I don't fall out of when I lay down or hang upside-down!

I know it's not a big jump, but for me it's a huge step on my path to accepting and loving my boobs. They're not abnormal, underdeveloped, they just needed a mental-push in the right direction. I'm still trying to find a good definition for their shape, but for now, I'm am super happy and cannot wait to get back to uni tomorrow after not seeing my other half for 3 weeks and show off my bit of extra confidence :D

**Thankyou so much to everyone on here who are always there to help people find their confidence and accept their lovely boobies for what they are.**

Much love.

I could fit four fingers between the gore and my body, so I decided to fit myself using the side bar. Hmm. (18)40H? That didn't sound right. 

Anyway, I decided to go to a store in the city (Brava in Melbourne, Australia) to get properly fitted. The lady that helped me was amazing. She brought me bras, gave me advice and fixed straps and the underwire and was generally very attentive. She fitted me properly (gore fitting to my chest; I used to think that it was normal for it not to), and sized me from a (14)36F to a (10)32J. 

I looked at it, and thought: 'Hang on. I can't have that small of a band. The last time I was in a size 10 was when I was 14!' Surprise surprise, it fit perfectly. I jumped, wiggled and danced like I was at a music festival. I stayed put. I'm staring at myself in the mirror, thinking ""what the actual fuck? This is amazing!"" 

So, ABraThatFits, I am still not sure if I'm in awe or shock, but either way, I'm doing it in a correctly fitting bra. 

TL;DR: I went down two band sizes and up five cup sizes. What the actual fuck. Also, Brava in Australia on Collins is an amazing store to buy from (granted, it's a bit pricey. I paid $100 for my newly fitted bra)

Right now I have 3 that fit very well, 2 that are wearable, 2 that don't really fit (might list those on bratabase), and 1 sports bra. On the way is a second sports bra (so I can alternate) and another bra with the same cut as one of my 3.

Maybe the word ""enough"" is also uncalled for because now that the Spring lines are coming out I feel so tempted to get some more. I think the Just Flew In Longline by Freya is a must for me since I can't find any Freya half cups in my back size and I would love to try/own one. I could also use one or two nude bras for the summer, I am very tempted to try Ewa for this. But at least now I'm not as desperate.

Getting a proper bra collection has made me much more interested in clothes as well. I was never big on shopping, especially not for clothes. Now it somehow seems more interesting and even fun, possibly because with the right bras I don't feel like I want to hide as much as I did before; I know my boobs are secure and there is no danger of them escaping, which is a big relief. I didn't even notice how much worry this was causing me; it must have constantly been at the back of my mind.

I was spilling over the top, out of the bottom, and the bras just generally weren't doing anything except crushing my breasts against my ribs and making my back hurt.

I've been reading fitting directions and taking my own measurements, and I knew that my 42DD wasn't even remotely close. Convincing my mother than my breasts were bigger than a DD, however, was proving difficult. I'm 24 years old, but my mom is involved in pretty much everything I do, and she pays for most of my stuff (since I'm a full-time college student, living in her house, and I can't find work). 

I'm pretty much the only woman in my family (extended included) with a ""full-figured bust."" The largest cup size on anyone in my family are my aunt's C cups, and they didn't come naturally. I think this is what got in the way of my mom's understanding. ""You can't be more than a DD! That's all they sell in normal stores and nobody else in the family is bigger than a C!"" She went so far as to suggest, even after seeing my breast tissue not fitting into the cup, that I ""just need a bigger band size."" 

I knew it wasn't going to work, but I reluctantly agreed to go with her to the mall to buy new bras (which I was expecting to be the same size I've got now and do nothing differently). And then we walked into the store and the manager met us at the door, ""Bras are buy two get one free today, and we do free fittings!""

My mom tried to shrug her off ""Oh no, we know the size we need, thank you."" but I said otherwise. ""Actually, I think I'll take you up on it."" I was hoping that a professional telling my mother that I needed a bigger cup would convince her.

The manager was fantastic. As she measured, she explained to me everything that she was doing, how she was taking measurements and how they would determine my size, how to properly try on bras to make sure they really do fit, etc. 

""What size bra are you wearing now?"" she asked.

 ""42dd,"" I said. ""I think the band is okay, but I feel like I need a bigger cup size."" My mom scoffed at that and told the manager that I didn't know what I was talking about.

""Well, I'm measuring you at a 40..."" she said, taking notes on a scrap of paper as she checked the measuring tape. ""And you fall somewhere between an F and a G, so we'll try the smaller and you can let me know if you think you'd feel more comfortable or supported in a G. It looks like your left breast might be a smidge bigger, so you're likely to gravitate towards the G. I don't think there's a big enough difference that you'll need a cup filler for the right, but we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.""

I thought my mom's eyes were gonna fall out of her head. She pretty much hovered on the other side of the store for the rest of my time there. The manager checked my bra fit (I wound up with the G) and helped me to pick out doubles in colors that I liked.

I paid for my purchase and had to call my mom from across the store so that she knew I was leaving. She grumbled about ""not being able to believe her daughter had bigger breasts than her"" and I'm pretty sure I heard something about ""shameful"" and something about the manager being a moron.

So my mom seems to think I'm some sort of amoral harlot because I have big boobs, but I feel more supported, physically comfortable, and comfortable with my body than I have for as long as I can remember.

I also would hide my chest with baggy clothes and it was just miserable. My mother herself had the same thing when she was younger - and I appreciate it was a more difficult time in terms of what was available, but she had a reduction in her thirties and never looked back. She encourages me to do the same and I am also entitled to an NHS (UK based) operation due to the back pain I am having. However, I assume these things change a lot when you have kids and as I'll only have one shot at free surgery, I figure I would want to wait until after kids. Plus, I'm not sure that's a route I necessarily want to take.

As I mentioned, when I was younger going to shops was hard and because I have always been overweight, I think the assumption was ""wow you need a larger band size to accommodate those boobs"" and to be honest as long as they fit into ANYTHING, regardless of how supportive they were, I was okay with it. It's only in the last five years or so that I've realised I want more support and to actually look good in clothes. I definitely hunch a lot which is something I attribute to my poor support for so many years. 

Currently I wear a 34H which I feel is okay. I always buy on the loosest hook so that there is scope to tighten as it stretches. I reduced the band size and upped the cup size a couple of years ago after reading something online and becoming bored with my boobs slipping under the band at the front and generally being useless. I still don't feel it's totally right though as the band rides up, which I guess means it's too small and my boobs still feel as though they are hanging. If I do the straps up it just makes it all ride up. The middle bit - gore?? - also isn't flush with my chest. My main issue with taking these measurements was that my boobs are kind of droopy for my age I think - perhaps due to the issues I mention above.

My measurements are below:
Relaxed/loose on skin: 33 inches 
Supertight: 32 inches
Chest+nipples: 42.5 (43 with a thin bra). I found this measurement pretty difficult because my nipples are not at all in line with where the band sits and yet the measurement instructions insisted it was a level measurement!
Leaning forwards: 44.5 (44 with thin bra)
Lying down: 42 (41.5 with thin bra) This was also pretty tough as they just splay out all to the sides.

Any help you can offer would be so appreciated - I'm really lost!

As I mention:
34H old size
5""2 ish
170 pounds
No kids, surgery or implants.
I sit at a desk all day.

I'd emailed them about their fit practices and got a promising email. However, things did not go well.  

I told them my size as 34GG or 36G and they insisted I was wrong. They measured my underbust and brought back 36Fs (I was wearing a 36FF what was *obviously* too small in the cup and riding up in the band) and 38DDs and even multiple 40Ds for me to try on. I tried them all on and showed the woman how poorly all the bras fit. The gore wouldn't tack, obvious boob spillage *everywhere*. Finally after trying on more than 20 horrible fitting bras, taking like 45 minutes of wasted time, I ask if she would please just humor me and bring me a 36G or 34GG. She said that I would ""just bend up all the wires"" in a 34GG, as if I was so fat I would bust out of the bra or something. This is *after* she showed me the tape measure, *in the mirror* of a 33 inch underbust (break the tape measure, 35 or 34 snug is more likely to work for me as realistic). Her reasoning for giving me ever larger bands with smaller cups was that the wires were not wide enough. I pointed out that the wires are wider in larger cups and she said ""not really, they are deeper cups."" WHAT?

So she brings me 2 bras in 36G and they are the best fitting things I tried on! She actually looked pissed off about this. My friend was in the next fitting room and heard how the woman was speaking to me and was worried about me. Anyway, I really really need a nude bra because my 36F is *killing me* (it was purchased from *another* small store that supposedly does ""real fittings"" etc) and I need a nude bra to wear to work *so badly*. So I tried the 36G [Fantasie Florence](http://www.amazon.com/Fantasie-Florence-Balcony-Bra-FL2412/dp/B004SDT556) and it was *almost perfect!* The only fit issue I had with it was that the very top of the cup was just a smidge too tight. I wasn't really quadboobing or anything, it just seemed like the cut of the very top of the bra was not open enough. Would going into a 34GG solve this issue? I also tried the 36G [Elomi Betty]( http://www.amazon.com/elomi-Betty-Underwire-Plunge-Bra/dp/B006A24K8U) and the only concern I had was that it was scratchy and again, just a smidge too closed on the top likely due to the weird pink squiggly stuff at the top of the cup.

I almost bought one of them because I was so desperate but the fitter was so *rude* to me, telling me when I asked multiple times for a smaller band and larger cup that I was *just wrong* and she had been doing this for 19 years and she started Freya in the US etc etc etc that I didn't want her to get the commission.  

Should I go with a 36G in the Fantasie Florence? I looked in Bratabase and didn't see the bra entered. Are there other 3 piece balcony bras by Fantasie that are just a smidge more open on the top?

I wear Panache in 36HH or thereabouts, so clearly these 36GG bras are *toooooooo* small.

[**Entice Gold/Ivory 36GG**](http://imgur.com/a/YHuBr)

* The band on this bra is HUGE. To be more precise, it stretches a LOT.

* The cups seem like a promising shape, if a bit shallow, so I may actually try this in a 32JJ if that's a real thing. Obviously the cups are a few volumes too small, and the band is insane. **Does 32JJ sound about right to anyone else?**

[**Elegance 36GG**](http://imgur.com/a/EiZeb)

* The band on this was closer to my Cleo Juna in terms of length and firmness. A bit loose for my taste, but still not bad.

* The shape of the plunge actually did better for me than most plunges do, but that could have just been that it was so much to small that my boobs had no space to just fall into the center like usual.

* It's not as pretty as I was hoping it would be, and the cup shape seems pretty shallow, but **I think I might try this in another size as well. 34J Maybe?** If that exists, anyway.

**TL;DR:**

***Nipples! Nipples EVERYWHERE!***

I just had to share my success with you all!

There wasn't a whole lot in my size that I'd measured (30DD) on the floor, so when one of the women asked if I needed help, I said of course. She asked if I'd been measured at Nordstrom before, so I said no, and she decided to measure me. I told her what size I measured to, she took my underbust measurement, and came to the same conclusion, testing me with a Chantelle 'C Chic' bra (that I ended up buying in red in 30DD). She had me scoop and swoop for every bra, and pointed out all the things that showed the bra fit - the tacking of the gore, the level of the band, and so on. She even brought me a robe (in case I got cold) and a cami (to test how the bras looked under light clothing, though I had brought a super-thin t-shirt with me for that). She also made sure to bring in her manager, who also checked out the fit of the bra and confirmed that it looked pretty great.

Then she brought out bras. SO MANY BRAS.

The bras she brought me varied in size, but almost all of them fit perfectly - it was so hard to choose when it came time to narrow down my choices. They all looked and felt gorgeous, but I didn't really want to spend a ton of money, so I ended up buying four bras, and one pair of panties to match one of them. My purchases:

Chantelle C Chic - Red - 30DD
Natori Feathers - Black - 32D
Chantelle Rive Gauche - Nude/Pink - 32DD
Natori 136001 Contour Underwire - Blue - 32D (with matching boyshorts)

and it came to $302. A bit much, but they all fit perfectly, like an absolute dream, and the fitting was nice, easy, and fun. All the people I interacted with took excellent care of me and were as helpful as they could be, so I figured it was worth spending a little extra in support.

Nordstrom is a great place to go get fit and get new bras, if a little expensive, and they really know their stuff. I'll definitely be going back the next time my size changes, and maybe even in between, too.

My boobies were sincerely unhappy, and my body was shapeless and sad. Inspired by this sub, I went to Lane Bryant today for my first bra-fitting ever, LB being my only option due to lack of specialty bra stores in my area. I went in wearing my too-small US 38D, but expected to come out wearing a 36G after sizing myself using MyWifesBusty's methods, and the Sophisticated Pair calculator. 

The attendant took my measurements and suggested...a 38D. I was surprised, tried it on anyway...and they didn't fit. Tried on a few different styles, no go. Tried a 38DD, still didn't fit. The attendant seemed shocked. She gave me some 38DDDs to try. Nope, still minor quad-boob. She seemed skeptical that I could possibly be above a DDD. Honestly, I could have probably came out with the DDD, if I wasn't scoop-and-swooping. But once I did the S&amp;S, it was resulting in (minor) quad-boob even in the DDD.

But finally, after 8 or so bras, I tried on a 38F...and dang!

This is where you can ask all the small questions you have about bras that aren't big enough to make your own thread about. If you're looking for fit advice or bra recommendations please make your own thread. =)



**I do have an important announcement I'd like to have the community feedback on.** About a week and a half ago, some of us got together and brainstormed on how we can improve the community. I made a suggestion on how we could improve the ordering process from some of the Polish Manufacturers; particularly Comexim.

 The current process is that if you live outside of Poland, you have to send an email to place an order, and I've seen posts that have described the frustration some customers (including myself) have had in attempt to order due to the language barrier, and the ordering process taking longer than it should. /u/FacepalmNapalm [made a suggestion](http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/1gt6lr/im_trying_to_order_from_comexim_and_cant_get_a/canrxrx) on a thread a while ago to run your email through Google Translate to include an English as well as a Polish Version of your email. She also suggested to write the subject of the email in Polish to ensure it does not get caught in their spam folders.

Here's my idea: We collectively come up with a series of phrases or possibly questions we would include in an email, and then we get them properly translated into Polish; and we will include a page on the wiki with the translations and corresponding questions. I've used the translation subreddit, so we'd hopefully be able to get someone to translate the questions for us. That way, if any of us decide to order from Comexim, we can simply pull up the wiki and then copy and paste our translated phrases and we can email them hopefully with more ease and get orders. This will probably turn into a larger guide on how to order bras from Poland, but for now, let's get going on Comexim, so those of us who need to order from them can do so after they start taking orders again on the 15th.

Thanks in advance for your feedback ladies!

With the hopes that seeing them all together might help in troubleshooting, I've compiled the issues I commonly run into in [this awesome MS Paint graphic](http://imgur.com/lTcYFPO). Yes, those underwires really are sitting on breast tissue on the bottom insides of the cups. This happens in all bras I've tried (although it's less pronounced with Cleos), so I just take taking in the bottom of the gore as a given at this point. I also frequently experience cups that are too wide-set all the way down and all-over too-shallow cups.

Obviously, I don't have all of these issues with all bras, so here's a brief list of which issues I've had with which bras:

* Freya, all styles I've tried (don't remember specifics, since I gave up on the brand) - All of them, except the extra material on the top.
* Elomi Suzie - Space at the bottom of the cup, wires angling back too much on the sides. Despite those issues, this was the most supportive bra I had when I was wearing Elomi sizes.
* Elomi Abi - Space at the bottom of the cup, overall too shallow and wide-set.
* Panache Tango Plunge - Space at the bottom of the cup, wires angling back too much on the sides, cups too wide-set.
* Panache Sports - Little bit of space at the bottoms of the cups, extra material at the tops of the cups, no gore tacking. Despite the issues, it's super-supportive.
* Cleo Juna - Too shallow in both 32H and 34H, and the 34 band is just too loose anyway. It's really too bad about the shallowness, because the wire shape and bottom-of-the-cup shape fit really nicely, unlike any other bra ever. I wear the 32H around the house on my days off despite epic quad-boobing, because it's more comfy than my other options.
* Cleo Marcie - Tiny bit of space at the bottoms of the cups and loose fabric at the tops. Like Juna, the wires on Marcie are a really great shape for me, but not so much with the cups. Despite that, this is my go-to daily bra, because it's mostly supportive and works okay if I pin the excess fabric down to the gore.
* Fantasie Salsa - The underwires distort so easily I couldn't even begin to tell what the cup shape was like. This bra was clearly not engineered for large boobs.
* Cleo Lucy - Space at the bottoms of the cups, wires too wide, overall too shallow.
* Bravissimo Boudoir Beau - This bra gets the prize for Worst Fit I've Ever Had. It hits all of the issues in my graphic except for the wire being too wide on the sides, plus it has the bonus of giving me quad-boob at the seam between the heavier fabric on the bottoms of the cups and the lace on top (despite the lace itself being way too loose!) *and* after a couple hours the cup fabric works its way down into the space between my boobs and the underwires, pulling my boobs down and causing extreme (to the point of bruising) pressure on the underwires  beneath. Weirdly, this is also the bra that looks best-fitting when I first put it on, which is how I ended up wearing it all day and finding out just how uncomfortable it is for me.

I know I'm forgetting some bras I've tried, but these are the ones that stand out as either really good or really bad fits. Any thoughts on what might work for me?

I was at that point wearing a 34DD but I was slightly coming out of the top of the cup, so presumed I would need a 34E.

The woman came over, measured me as being 33.5 underbust, and so told me I should be wearing a 38 inch band. THE HELL. WHAT?! I just went '...um, ok?' I thought they shouldn't do the whole 'add on four inches' thing any more?

She brought over a 38DD. It was the biggest thing I've ever tried on in my life. It was basically dangling from the straps and not touching my body. The cups... it was like they were consuming my breasts. Huge.

I said it was a bit big, she brought me a 38D. Cup was better, because it was the equivalent of an E in a 34! She said it fit perfectly... bearing in mind I can fit both my arms down the band and then streeeeetch.

I spotted a 36D on the bench, and grabbed that. Had to wear it on the tightest band setting to make it fit somewhat... She told me you should always wear bras on the tightest setting. Um, no? She said that was my size, despite the fact I'm spilling out of the top. I tried to point that out and she got a bit angry: 'NO! That is the CORRECT size! It is NORMAL! I am the fitter!'

She had also brought in a 36DD, so I tried that on... it fit, but again, tightest setting. I quickly got out of there, got my Â£5 discount voucher, put the bras back and ran out of the shop before the woman could see I wasn't getting them.

All are women at various life stages.

Let me know if you have others to add.  I'd love to have clear categories for these resources, but I'm not certain what categories would be most helpful to this community - maybe bra size or bra issues (such as maternity, sub-30 band, etc.)

Also, I'd LOVE to know about blogs for the smaller cup sizes.  I feel adrift when I have so many resources for larger cup sizes, but very few for smaller cup sizes.

I had to go to the mall to purchase a birthday gift, and since I had a ton of time, I decided to go into Dillards and Macys and look at bras. I've yet to find my perfect bra but a girl can hope!

Anyways, Dillards is having a massive sale and has some nice, name brand (I saw Wacoal and Curvy Kate for instance) bras for less then $10. They have them situated in bins by band size, and there was another woman checking out the 42 bin. She had her mother and daughter there and they were goofing around while searching and trying to help find mom a bra. I was going through the 40 bin while I waited for her to finish up and she asked what size I was looking for. I told her ""42E but I'll try on sister sizes!"" and she just stared at me. I asked what she was looking for and she told me a 42 C but she could do 40s sometimes. I just stared at her and asked where she'd been fitted. She said they fit her at Dillards and I kind of chuckled. I told her about ABTF and that I really doubted she was a 42 C and was probably closer to a 38G or so. She didn't believe me and I convinced her to try on a 40G (the closest we could find). Lo and behold it fit her nearly perfectly! She looked amazing after she tried it on.

Thanks for sharing all of your stories and pictures, now if I can just find a bra for myself...but she got a beautiful 38G (I don't remember the brand but I've seen you talk about it here) for $7.50. I'm a little jealous lol

**Serious Lift.** I'm about an F-cup, and it's exceptionally hard to find anything in DD+ that's built to actually push the boobs up. My breasts are really soft and saggy (from some weight gain/loss issues), so they need a lot of support in the first place, but I'd really like to find a push-up or something else that will give serious lift and major cleavage. I'd rather not have to wear two bras, which is the way I've seen it done on blogs.

**Sheer, sexy style.** Is it possible to get great support with a sheer style? I've heard good things about sheer, seamed bras like [Freya Arabella](http://www.freyalingerie.com/lingerie/essentials/arabella/underwired_plunge_balcony_bra.aspx?colour=black) - has anyone tried it and can give me a testimonial?

That also includes the posture vest, or whatever it's called.

First impressions: It doesn't fit

Second impressions: I'm rather in love with it and WANT it to fit. It's incredibly comfortable, and I immediately felt relief in my shoulders and back in a way that surprised me. It's not that I noticed the discomfort before-- I noticed the discomfort after it went away. I carry a lot of stress in my back and shoulders, too, I think this contributes.

So... I will be working to hopefully get an exchange that fits better. Onward and upward (in cup size and a bit down in the band)!

Edit: I have been corresponding with Tallia at Braologie regarding my return, and I'm really impressed.

We are starting to get the hang of sizing for hourglass figures (it is harder than it looks) and we are truly happy that although that we didn't get you the right size, you still love our products are enjoy them. Our team has always debated on whether to ask clients for the photos with only bra and with clothes on. As many women are uncomfortable with showing pictures of them wearing bra only to a stranger. After all these hourglass figures we have seen, we have made a decision that it should be mandatory to have both sets of pictures to have a better sense of a client's body shape. I guess this is part of our growing process and we are really happy that our clients such as yourself being so considerate regarding this issue.

&gt;We will send out products that fit you, having a better sense of your size and fit. As for the bras that you have at home, we have noticed that you are active in the Bratabase community so we hope that you can send it to someone that is interested in it. Please note that, try to give it to someone that has 2 cups smaller than yourself for the best fit possible. 

&gt;The bras that we send out will fit you, with bigger cups and smaller bands but we can not guarantee if you will hook it to the most outer column of hooks since body shape fluctuates wildly and our products are one of the most elastic on the market. 

&gt;We will also send you a smaller mini vest.

&gt;And finally, you really look great in our products, despite the sizing issues the bra is doing what it is intended bringing out the full curves in you without using a gimmicky push up bra. I truly feel that no other brands can do this at the moment. 

&gt;If you have any other questions, please feel free to message me. Again we apologize for the sizing issues but we feel that we are starting to have a good grasp on hourglass figures. 

&gt;Thank you so much and we will inform you when we ship out a better size products to you.

&gt;Please dont hesitate to contact us if you have any questions.

&gt;Best regards

&gt;Tallia

Needless to say, I am impressed that they would rather the bras be given to other women to test, in a way that will make it more likely that they fit, than have them returned. Granted, I believe they did alter my bra to fit my measurements more exactly before they sent it to me, so this would likely make it harder to resell, but I am still impressed with the ethic. I am also thrilled that they have taken my specific issues and are addressing them. 

For those interested, I have listed these bras for give away on Bratabase :)

So after finding this sub and figuring I was a 30E and not a 34D, my stepmom and I went shopping. 

She said she was a 34B and I was like, no way. I suggested we try refitting and she was receptive. I pulled a TON of bras from 32C-34D. The 32C was too small (she was amazed at scooping and swooping), and the 34D was a nogo. We decided the 34 band was too loose, and the 32 band was about perfect. 

We pulled more 32Ds, but they all seemed to gape at the top. After some hemming and hawing and Googling, we decided she had shallow breasts, and moved from full coverage to some demi push-ups. We did it!

They looked SO good, even I was excited and they weren't even my boobs! No quad-boob or gaping, the band fit great, and the wire and gore sat great. She found a sexy lace bra, two basics in black and nude, and a sports bra. She is so happy, and so am I! And we got 5 bras (I got one too) for $122. 

She put on the 34B and we busted up laughing at how bad it was. She's so excited she ""finally has boobs"". :D

1360700853.0,30,self.ABraThatFits,18eb1t,My first experience with Elle Macpherson,slidde06801,30,0,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/18eb1t/my_first_experience_with_elle_macpherson/,"I made a post a few weeks ago wondering about Elle Macpherson bras and the feedback I got was mixed but with a heavy leaning towards ""really tight band and tad to small in the cup"". After hearing that I thought I would pass on that brand but I kept gravitating towards those beautifully feminine bras. I said what the heck and ended up buying two to try out. 

So here is what I think:

The first Macpherson bra I received in the mail was the Dentelle in 32G. Woof, let me tell you ladies that this bra is gorgeous. It has a firm lace cup with a mesh lining and three hook clasp.

[Dentelle](http://imgur.com/a/7y1lO)

* I love the fact that the cup is made entirely of firm lace. None of that stretchy stuff (I'm just not a fan of it). I found that the cup on me is pretty spot on even when I extreme scoop &amp; swoop.
* Lift and support-wise this bra is nothing too special, it just looks really really good on. 
* The band is not very stretchy at all, but I could get it hooked on the last row of hooks. To make sure I don't stretch out the band to quickly and ruin the fabric, I will pop on a bra back extender until the fabric loosens on its own. Now, I prefer a very tight band compared to others. If you are interested in this bra I would recommend either buying up a band size or investing in some extender hooks! I got mine pretty cheap on eBay.

Dentelle Rating: **B+**

The second Macpherson that I indulged in was the Never forget also in 32G. This bra is so dainty and feminine. 

[Never Forget](http://imgur.com/a/zGzTf) 

The colors are different IRL the Dentelle is very salmony and the Never forget is a bright girly pink.

* The cup has the same no nonsense lace that I love, but is less forgiving. It is a hair small in the cup, but I am not sure that a larger cup size would have been effective.
* The lift is something I might just forget in this bra. That said, I feel very pretty in this bra. 
* The band runs a tad tight but not nearly as tight as the Dentelle and it only has a 2 hook clasp.

Never Forget Rating: **B-** 

I am very happy with the bras, they are beautifully made, and I wear them often. I think I will definitely be buying more bras from Elle Macpherson.

1375831700.0,25,self.ABraThatFits,1juh87,[Storytime!] Yet another hilarious Victoria's Secret experience...,shadyoaks,33,8,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/1juh87/storytime_yet_another_hilarious_victorias_secret/,"I popped into Victoria's Secret real quick today, mostly because I love to torture myself with grey and pink bras apparently...I thought, maybe...just maybe, I could find that crazy ""increase two cup sizes"" bra in a 32D. I want ridiculous cleavage for work. It would be pretty close after all, right? And a little bit smaller would probably give me some sweet boobies too.
 
Well, first of all, they don't make that one in that size, I guess. It wasn't on the floor. Not ready to give up deluding myself, I grabbed a few 32D pushups to try on.

The first associate I dealt with was nice, but it sounded like she wasn't sure it was the correct size for me. Fair, I'm small busted and petite overall and most people don't think of me as anything bigger than a B cup I'd bet.

After she looked at me in the 32D, she told me that I had the band clasped too tight (I had it on the tightest clip and I could still fit 2 fingers under it. She told me I should be able to do that!!) and the straps too tight. She claimed it would shorten the life of my bra if I did that. I don't know if there's any truth to that.

So she loosened everything and then she grabbed me a few others, including a demi cut bra. The demi had too much gapping at the top, sadly. I love the demi cut but I'm pretty sure that shape isn't right for my breasts.

This was when she started pulling out 32Cs. Oh no. She was really confused when I still had the same gapping issue. I actually had to tuck my nipples back into the 32C demi bra after swooping and scooping so I didn't flash her!

At this point, her shift ended and another girl took over from there. I took this opportunity to give up, resigned to buying bras at Nordstrom or online. This associate seemed to be at least aware of full on top vs. full on bottom, which made me happy. As I was leaving the fitting room, I told her about the gapping problem I had with a few of the bras. She suggested that I pull the straps tighter, and I told her that the other girl told me to loosen my straps!

I told her that I usually wear 30DD, and she seemed to think that she had seen the size carried on the website. I was CERTAIN that wasn't true, but I let her check anyway. We walked up to the front computers so she could check. Another girl chimed in to try and help, but when I told her my size, get this- she said she had NEVER EVEN HEARD OF A 30DD. She looked at me skeptically and asked what size I was wearing now. I told her, 30DD. 

""Maybe try a 32A?""

I decided this was the time to nope the fuck out of there. 

I've officially given up on Victoria's Secret bras, I'll stick with the panties. It's finally sunk in, I think, that I will never find a bra that fits me from them unless they change the whole sizing system they have.

We greatly appreciate the community feedback!**

So here are the results:

---

**First Question was: How should we decide which members to consider for expert flair?**

The results were as follows:

**Open Application** - Anyone can asked to be considered (88) 44%

**Nomination by Anyone** - Anyone can suggest another member be considered (61) 31%

**Nomination by Experts** - Any member already with an expert flair can suggest another member be considered (40) 20%

**Other** (11) 6%

Some of the ""other"" responses were basically any given combination of the 3 given choices. So, we have decided on this:

Self nomination as well as nominating others will be allowed. Some ladies might feel too shy to nominate themselves, or don't feel like they are ready although others may feel that they are.

---

**Second Question was: How should we decide whether a member should receive expert flair?**

The results were as follows:

**Quiz Only** - Members take a quiz for whatever category they want flair in, and their score determines what tier their flair falls in. (13) 7%

**Review Only** - Their comment history is reviewed and used to determine what tier they fall in. (41) 21%

**Quiz and Review** - They are given a quiz to determine which tier they fall in, but their comment history is also reviewed to double check that the quiz result seems accurate. (140) 70%

**Other** (6) 3%

There was an overwhelming response to ""Quiz and Review"". We are thinking of making a quiz that will cover the basics of bra fitting to be administered to applicants hoping to enter the first tier, something to make sure that the nominee knows how to do some basic size calculations and shape identification, that type of thing. For the second and third tiers we will require applicants to link to specific comments or threads where they feel like they gave good advice about topics that would have been covered in the quiz. We decided that we didn't want to do a quiz for the second and third tiers because it would require that we have several versions of each quiz which means a lot of time and effort would have to be put into making and maintaining them, and we simply see it as a little redundant since we will be reviewing comment history anyway. Applicants for all tiers will have their comment history reviewed, the reviewing process will enable the reviewers to sort through the nominee's post history and work with them to develop their knowledge and skills.

---

**Third Question was: If a review system is used, who should conduct the reviews?**

The results were as follows:

**One mod** (11) 6%

**At least 2 mods** (31) 16%

**One expert (may be a mod but does not have to be)** (19) 10%

**A panel of experts (can include one or more mod but does not have to)** (67) 34%

**A panel of experts including at least one mod** (67) 34%

**Other** (5) 3%


We have decided to do a panel of experts, and the mods will likely be involved in the application review but not necessarily all the time; the mods are the ones that give out the flair though so we will also be reading through to determine how the experts came to their conclusion before giving out the flair even if we weren't exactly involved in the decision making process. The process will involve us creating a separate subreddit for people to apply for flair, the experts will be subscribed to it and they can choose to help review an application that is posted there if it falls under their area of expertise. There's going to be a blanket rule of not being allowed to post unless you're an expert or you're nominating yourself/someone else; breaking this rule will get you banned from the nomination subreddit. This is so that the application process can be seen and read by everyone for transparency, although only the experts that are involved in the decision making and reviewing process of the applications and deciding on the outcome will be allowed to post, and so that we have a place that it won't distract from other content in r/abrathatfits. The subreddit name and link is to be announced.

**Also, we would like feed back on what we should call our 3 teirs!** Feel free to share any suggestions; be creative and feel free to inject some humor. The first tier we (/u/otterhugs and myself) could come up with was 'bralette' or 'training bra', so any suggestions on what to name the second and third tier would be awesome.

The french band size is closer to this measurement, so this is very confusing.

I say âmeasuredâ because they said that they measured without bras and just by trying on several bras which was very helpful to be hones because i was comparing it to my bra measuring experience in Marks and Spencerâs where they measured me with a tape and said that I was a G and when they obviously saw that I wasn't one they just said go to the website and find bigger sizes.
The bra that I have is a bra I brought off from eBay for Â£15 because buying a bra for Â£30 upwards is torture. I tried several bras and the bra that was the most comfortable was this one:

[Candy bliss bra](http://www.bravissimo.com/products/lingerie/sensational-sets/candy-bliss-bra/pink-silver/ln173psv/?criteria=candy+bliss)

The sales assistant especially noted the fact that the material at the bottom of the cup is a stiff material that will hold my breasts. 

I have brought a bra like it off eBay and it ticks a lot of the right boxes. The center of the bra is the nearest to my rib cage than any other bra has ever been. (I don't think that any bra will have a center that will hit my rib cage because I have extra fat near the top of my breasts that prevent bras from doing that) and it holds up my breasts and everything but some of the problems are the fact that the band feels quite tight. I don't know if this is to do with the fact that for the last year I have been wearing sports bras and I am not used to an underwired bra yet. And I have a little bulge of my breasts at the top of the bra but I don't know if it is normal because of the style ( its a balconette and I have pretty much always wear full cups)

My question is should I go up a bra band size to a 38 (the bra that I ordered is 36k)

Or should I go up a cup size because of the small bulging of my boobs at the top of the bra?

And also does the bra look like a good fit?

Thank you!,Hurricane_Alice,32,3,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/1cfuuh/you_ladies_have_helped_boost_my_confidence_by/,"Ladies, I would like to thank you all. Because of you I measured myself and went out on a limb and bought some bra's from the UK. I can't tell you how embarassing it has been for me to constnatly have to pull my bra straps up (even in tight long sleeved shirts) while teaching. Or how annoying it was for me to have to wear a thin, cheap ""sports bra"" over my bras to smoothe them out so I could wear them under 90% of my shirts. 

I knew that there had to be something better, but I wore 32DD as my ""true size"" for years. And that was an improved fit to the 36b I was wearing! While it was not painful as the 36B was, it was not much of an improvement as the bra's would stretch out so much after 5-6 wears that they completely gaped and offered no support. 

I was always embarassed about my gaping if I couldn't find the ""sports bra"" to cover it, but the straps were the worst part. It was constant. If i tightened the straps, the band would move up my back, giving me horrible backfat and making the gaping worse. Then they would still fall down. 

Since measuring myself and trying new bras, even in wearing bras 1-2 cup sizes too small (bad ordering at first and I didn't think it was worth sending back or know that bratabase would help me with selling nwt bras) has helped boost my confidence. Now I'm proudly wearing a 28FF that fits really well (not quite perfectly, but it's a style issue, not a size issue) and my boobs look great! If someone glances at my chest (as people do) I no longer assume that they're looking at my gaping bra! I take it as a compliment. 

I just wanted to rave and thank you ladies for helping boost my confidence!

Edit: I'd also like to emphasize that the straps not falling down is amazing as well. This almost had me in tears many of times. I  tried the clip things that brought the straps together in the back like a sports bra, and these helped (some) with both issues I mentioned, but then my bra straps almost always showed which made me look less professional.

I tell her the size I'm wearing, 32G, but say the wires at the gore float a bit. She says that the band's too small, and I'm like, lol no, the cups are a bit small, so I'm probably a 32GG(H?).

I argue for a bit, but then I have to leave anyway, so I take this time to. The only reason I got so mad is because I was already mad at her friend, who was supposed to show up over an hour ago and was only just getting out of the shower.

http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/17ygdd/help_mepleasensfw/

(a bit lengthy)

First off, I'd like to thank all you lovely ladies for taking the time and energy to help me (and many other women!) find a bra that fits! I had been jamming my breasts into 36D's and 34DD's since I hit puberty, thinking that it was my boobs that were wrong, not the bras I was buying. I knew bras came in sizes bigger than a DD, but I never imagined myself as such. Well, after a few week's journey, I have finally found that I am a 32G(us sizing) or a 32F(uk sizing)! Wow! 

After my first post, I felt that I was armed with enough knowledge and power to be able to venture out into the bra world and snag me a bra that fits. I knew Macy's carried a larger selection of sizes, so I took my moral support (boyfriend :D) and marched into that store confident and cocky. 

My intention with walking into the store was to not ask any salesperson for help, but after seeing their limited selections on the shelf, I had to swallow my pride and do so. When I told the lingerie department person that I was looking for a 32G, she scoffed at me and said, ""There's no way you're that big, sweetie"" and promptly threw a measuring tape around my rib cage (as previously stated in my first post, I measure 31.5 inches around my ribs and 38-39 around the bust). I told her that I was wearing a ""minimizing"" sports bra and that the results would be skewed, but she pompously declared me a 36C and shuffled me into a dressing room. This woman brought me around 10 bras in that size and followed me into the dressing room! I told her that 36C wasn't my size and that I needed a 32G, but she wouldn't listen. To get her to shut up, I tried one on, and pointed out how I was falling out of the cups and that the band was climbing up my back, but she said it was a perfect fit. I finally got her to leave the dressing room, but she stood outside the door frame like she was guarding it! All I wanted to do was try on a few bras in my size, but this woman would not listen to me or leave me alone, so I left.

But I did not leave defeated!

I knew this woman was horribly wrong, and that it's normal for a woman to wear a size 32G and not be a porn star. I had heard good things about Nordstrom's, but the closest one to me was an hour away. I decided to try a Nordstrom Rack before making the journey to Nordstrom's. I was surprised by how many options they had! I took 17 bras into the dressing room and emerged with one that I thought fit pretty well! I ended up buying a Fantasie bra in a 32F(UK), but I wasn't satisfied...I needed more!

So off to Nordstrom's I went! When I walked in, I was greeted by a very friendly saleswoman who said she could help me. I told her my size, and she didn't even blink an eyelash! She collected probably 25 bras for me to try and went in the dressing room with me to adjust straps/hook the back for me so I could swoop and scoop easier. Out of those bras I found a lovely Panache Superbra in 32F that seemed that it was made for my breasts! I have never felt such support in my life! It had a seam in it, but the fit was so amazing that I didn't care! I also ended up with a Wacoal bra in 32G, that while slightly grandmaish, fit like a dream and made it feel like my breasts weren't even there!

All in all I came home with 3 bras, 2 fitting perfectly, and 1 almost perfect (but it was on sale for $15 so I won't complain).

I was so elated with my success that I wanted to share my story with my mother. Upon telling her my size, she smirked and said, ""you're probably a C cup, maybe a D cup, but just barely"". Even after showing her the bras I just purchased, and her agreeing they fit amazingly, she still didn't believe that I was that size. It's just a number and a letter! It doesn't define who you are or how big your breasts are, it's all about proportion! Gah, but there was no arguing with her. You win some you lose some I guess.

Thank you again for everyone who helped me! And thank you for taking the time to read my update. I just wanted everyone to see that you can succeed in finding a bra that fits, even when you have obstacles in your path. There is a correct fitting bra out there for everyone, don't give up, because you will find it!

When I first started needing proper bras, I went into VS with my mom to get sized.  For some reason they sized me at a 32 A.  So on I go, buying bras and going up a cup size whenever I need to.  It gets interesting when I get to a 32D, which is already kind of a tricky bra to find.  My bras just don't work any more!  It's like I put them on, and all they do is cover my boobs, no support whatsoever.  I go and get sized again at a different place, and they tell me I could wear a 32D but a 34B might fit me better.

Um, hahaha.  You might have guessed it.  No. Nope.  Not even close.  

So I give up on getting sized at stores, and do it myself.  Apparently, at the stores they've been adding 2 inches to my band size FOR NO FLIPPING REASON.

So I'm a 30 band size, and I go up a cup to a DD to compensate.  WOOHOO.  Except wait, there are like no stores near me that sell that size, so I have to go online and order very pricey bras that are my size :/

So they arrive in my mail, and I immediately put them on the tightest strap setting out of pure habit because that's what I used to have to do with the too-big ones, and I damn near suffocate.  Whoops.  Forgot, you're SUPPOSED to buy bras that fit you at the widest strap, and shorten them as they stretch. 

So I fix that, and boom, my boobs have suddenly gained the power of levitation or some shit like that.

So I thought.
If they're labeling my true fit to be a 32G (and that'd only be if they're using UK sizing. I've concluded they're going by US sizing) and that's what I aimed for, I'd be aiming for a band with much less support than what I get now. They're in fact trying to say I'm in a UK 32F, putting me in a band too large with a cup **two sizes too small**. I doubt they even read my damn review, or they'd realize I was wearing a 28 band that I hadn't swooped &amp; scooped. None of the girls that they're ""answering the question"" about seem to have any 30 and under bands! Apparently no one's allowed to have a 30 band!
Some of the girl's ribs aren't even shown. And ""DDD""? ""JJJ""? They've got girls that are definitely *not* 36/38 bands listed at ""38H"" and ""36DD"". It's blogs like this that really promote ignorance and annoy me.

1375569671.0,25,self.ABraThatFits,1jneap,VS was more accurate than Nordstroms...,shuzuko,28,3,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/1jneap/vs_was_more_accurate_than_nordstroms/,"I ended up going to the biggest mall in the area today, as it's the end of Nordstrom's sale and Dillards was also having an intimates sale. I was specifically looking for skintone and strapless bras, as I have not bought any since finding my correct size. Obviously there were no 28 bands in either store, but I can often size up to a 30F or sometimes even 32E if the band is tight enough, so I figured it was worth a shot. Got left alone at Dillards for the most part, but I did hear another woman getting fitted and it seemed not terrible. I almost bought a 32DDD b'tempted with the intent of altering it down, but ultimately decided that because it was neither skintone nor strapless and I would definitely need to alter it, I couldn't justify the purchase.

When I was in Nordstrom's, though, I did end up getting help as the place was kind of in shambles due the the mass of people coming in for the end of the sale. I found a black Freya Patsy (on sale) and coral Patsy longline (not on sale) in 30F as well as a nude Deco in the same size on my own. The longline was too loose without a third column of eyes, and while the black Patsy was nice, the sale price wasn't low enough to actually purchase it because it didn't fit what I had originally come in for. The Deco was pretty much perfect, which I expected thanks to having lots of luck with them so far. I still wanted to see what else there was, though, so I asked for help. I asked an assistant for anything they had in the 30 DDD/E/F/FF/G range to try on, trying to ask for a wide range as a lot of what they had was in US or French sizes.  First issue: I was brought almost exclusively 30 DD/E, most of which were far too small. When I asked for help again, I was misheard and was handed 32G (slightly too big for the most part, except one chantelle that was a horrible shape anyway). Then a fitter came in and, while she was nice enough, she didn't really seem to really know what she was doing. She brought me the sizes I asked for, at least, but when all but one ended up being incompatible with my shape she kept insisting I size down in the cup. When I showed her how well the 30F Deco fit, she kind of shrugged it off and didn't really seem to know what to say. I bought the Deco anyway, as I really needed a skintone bra.

I had some free time still so I wandered the mall a bit, and as I passed by the VS I decided to see if any of their 32DDD strapless were tight enough in the band to justify buying. I grabbed a couple of bras myself, a 32DD strapless and a 32DDD body demi, and was told to press the button in the fitting room when I wanted some help. The first girl told me I was wearing the straps too tight on the DD, and that's why I had quadboob... but when she loosened them, they fell right off and I still had quadboob. No go, obviously. The second girl came in, though, and right away she diagnosed some of the problems: cup too small, gore floating, and cup too closed. The band was actually pretty firm for VS; I could only pull it about 2.5 inches away (although it was as tight as I could make it). Sadly that style didn't go up to a 32DDD- a cupsize up might actually have been close enough to fitting for me to buy it, as I really do need a strapless. She brought me a bunch of other styles, but none seemed to work out very well, and the fitter agreed with me. At one point I mentioned the band being much too loose, and she said ""you probably actually need a 30, maybe even less""- then proceeded to start measuring me actually at my underbust, although she quickly corrected and measured over. I didn't see the actual measurement as she held it at an angle, but she confirmed that I had too tiny of a ribcage for most VS bras. She even laughed at the last one I tried on, saying ""I could probably fit my whole arm under your gore!"" She recommended Dillards and Nordstrom's, and nodded sadly when I told her I hadn't found any strapless I liked at either store. She apologized for not being more help and said it seemed like I really knew what I was looking for in a bra. I thanked her for her help and her time, and she never tried to pressure me into buying something that obviously didn't fit.

I have been a regular lurker/poster here (this is a throwaway account) for a year now, and having found my ""real size"", I have failed to find a bra that fits nevertheless and this issue has been making things worse.

My breasts are in the 28E/F range and as far as I'm concerned, after trying countless bras in countless sizes in and around the aforementioned sizes, there is still not a single bra that has wide enough wires without being too big or too tall. It is very obvious to me how this could be an issue as there is really no bra out there that can fit short and wide boobs that aren't exactly shallow either - simply spreading horizontally across the chest. This actually makes me unable to wear any bra out there - yes, including those recommended on abrathatfits for the relevant sizes/shapes and even bras outside of those, along with bras with the widest measurements on bratabase.

Yet regards to this I notice a lot of users and bloggers have a tendency to complain about if a bra has too wide wires or too shallow cups (and I am excluding actual 'reviews', though they always count as feedback anyway due to the general blogger shape/size range), and that confuses me considering that they might impair a good fit, maybe be uncomfortable, but in the presence of a great number of wonderful narrow-wire/projection brands (freya, ewa michalak, fauve, fantasie, kris line...) and alongside the fact that it might just be possible to wear these bras if they really, REALLY wanted to, this seriously puzzles me. I figure this has a lot to do with the fact that most of the bra bloggers seem to have shapes/sizes well out of the range of issues like mine, but does that have to mean that companies end up following such feedback?

My point is not to rant here, but to seriously somehow think of a solution. It makes zero sense that ladies with wider boobs have to go through this much trouble to find brands, and after finding them also end up having to deal with newer cuts made to fit the general feedback due to lack of feedback from their size/shape range. It seems unfair that I have to resort to wearing regular store sized sports bras simply because no one bothers to make bras with wires/shapes suitable for breasts like mine/changes their present cuts because there is a lack of women voicing their concerns about this issue (which may or may not be because the bra community in general seems geared towards assuming ladies with bigger breasts have some form of priority in trouble-shooting as fit issues are likely to affect their health more / because they were left out of the minimal range of sizes that were generally available). Does this mean there simply has to be more bloggers with this shape/size? Is any bra manufacturer going to recognise a market that might simply not be as big as those for narrow and/or projected breasts and therefore not nearly as profitable?",,False,,t5_2s8kf,False,,,True,t3_1j6une,http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/1j6une/why_are_bra_manufacturers_moving_towards/,

I was one of those people that when I measured myself did not believe it at all. I had been measured in a store before, they said I was 34A/32B. My bras are mostly 32A. One day I noticed that none of my bras really fit. 

It turns out I'm actually a 26E. Of course none of my bras fit. 

Today I just received the 2 28DDs that I ordered and thought that I would hate them- they had lace detailing, which I don't normally go for, and they have no padding which makes me paranoid about nips.

But I just tried them on- and didn't want to go back to wearing my other bra! It's such a HUGE difference! I've never had a bra actually fit on the outermost hook before. And I kind of feel ridiculous that this made me as happy as it did, and that I wanted to share it. But I don't have anyone to (happy) rant to in real life so... yay!

Thank you! 



TL;DR: Was wearing 32A. Measured. Am actually 26E. Got 28DD (Easier to find). Great success!

Last year, I did the /r/ABraThatFits self-measuring method, and was completely incapable of believing I was a 34J. I said ""fuck it"" and just let the Nordstrom's saleslady tell me what size I was. 

She put me in a 36DDDD(US). That's what I've been wearing for the last year. While it was a vast improvement from the 40DDD(US) I wore prior, it still never felt *quite* right.

Today, I started reading about the possibility that my... *cough* ""back bacon"" may be caused by breast tissue migration from a (still) improperly fitting bra.  I was already very tired of my bra constantly moving out of place and having underwire poking me in the sides and armpit, but when presented with the possibility of vanquishing the evil back bacon, I did the self-measuring method again. 

Whelp. According to the guide, I am still at least a 34J, and possibly even a 34K. 

I am completely demoralized by having to shop for new bras, two at a time, at ~$60-70 a pop, then having to return half of them (assuming either of those sizes fits in the first place), and pay the postage on it.

Some extra stuff:

1. Please continue contiributing to the [Before&amp;After](http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/15qnxl/before_and_after_sizes/) post with your stories, and pictures too if you can! =)

2. [Bratabase's Breast Shapes Gallery](http://www.bratabase.com/blog/2012/nov/21/determining-your-breast-shape-202/) needs our help!

3. So does [The Bra Band Project](http://www.brabandproject.com/)

4. Scoop and Swoop photos, what we would love is some photos just like the ones in the [Bras and Body Image post](http://brasandbodyimage.wordpress.com/2012/09/05/putting-your-bra-on-properly/), but of women in various sizes to show that women with small chests and medium chests benefit from it too so that we can add it to the Busty Resources Wiki, you can put the photos in the wiki yourself, or send the photos to the mods here or the ones at /r/bigboobproblems (though if you're sending them over there please explain why you're sending them)

5. I'm making a visual fitting guide and am trying to incorporate as many body/breasts shapes as I can, what I could use is a front on shot without a bra, a side shot of you leaning forward as if you were measuring like the MWB guide says, a side shot of you laying down, and just a normal standing up side shot. If you want to throw in a shot of your back that could be helpful too. I only need from your neck to your waist. What I'll do with the pictures: I'll trace an outline of your body, and that'll be all I'll use, no other details just an outline and it'll be totally anonymous (unless you want me to put your username on it so you can tell people you contributed to it) =)  I'd like to get as many examples as I can so if you feel comfortable with taking a picture of your bare breasts I would really appreciate your help, even if you can't get me all of those shots I'm requesting, any contribution would be appreciated. PM them to me or send them in a message to the moderators =)

6. As always, continue adding your bras and measurements into [Bratabase](http://www.bratabase.com/), even if they don't fit!

The wire width was awesome and the cup volume fit decent, but scaling up those three sizes from my usual 36GG meant wires that were far too tall, as seen in [**these NSFW photos**](http://imgur.com/a/BNlx9). Loving the bra and being unable to return anyway, I decided I'd try alterations to make it work. 

The first Google search on where to buy new underwires led me to [Sassy Sew Fabrics](http://sewsassy.com), which carried many sizes in many shapes and for around only a dollar per pair. After measuring the underwires of the bra and looking over their website, I decided to order 9 different models and just compare directly to see which ones to try to swap in to my bra. (This meant that I had really ordered 24 pairs of underwire, as some models were only available in packages of 6 pair, but the total after shipping still was only around $20.)

[**Here's an album of each size next to the bra.**](http://imgur.com/a/d4CXm#0)

Now, none of the underwires turned out to be very strong, so if I attempt an alteration like this in the future then I'll probably look for a different source with higher quality metal, but this will do.

To me, it seems like the UW10 and UW927-24 are the closest and would give me the non-rigid space I need in the channel both at the gore and in the arm pits to prevent stabbing. 

I don't really have any sewing experience and would prefer not to destroy this bra, so:

* Can anyone provide some tips for switching out the wire without doing irreparable damage? 

* Would it be best for me to just take the bra in to the local Alteration Station?

* Could those demi wires be any laughably smaller? :P",,False,,t5_2s8kf,False,,braexpert,True,t3_1awdin,http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/1awdin/so_i_bought_shorter_underwires_for_a_bra_that/,

For starters, I'm usually around a 32FF/30G. Last week, I was browsing some of the newer bras and lingerie from Elomi and saw a picture of a gorgeous model in an adorable babydoll and though, oh, poor me, the plus-sized girls get this pretty babydoll and I'm sized out.

Flash to today. I'm at Nordstrom checking out with my new Freya Hello Sailor bikini (quick review: cup sizes run big, watch out, but it is super cute), and beautiful, skinny, sporty gal checking me out says, ""Oh, I'm so jealous. I tried on the bottoms in a small but the cupsize runs too big for me."" And I thought, ""Oh, poor you, sized out for once in your life -- you get all the pretty things 99% of the other times.""

And then I realized, no way, she was probably like a 28C (guestimating) and probably has just as much trouble finding cute bras as....

wait

everyone else.

I was jealous of a plus-sized girl this week, she was jealous of a full-bust girl this week (me!) and I'm /used/ being jealous of the sporty/slim girls like her.

I know we have a long way to go in sizing and respect for body types and really believing that great clothes -- and BRAS! -- are for ladies of all sizes, but surely, this experience is a sign that we're moving in the right direction.

Also, I've been eyeing some La Senza bras (Cotton Lightly Lined Demi and The Show Off Removable Push Up Bra) and was wondering how close to the Aerie their fit is?  Could I get a 30B in those with success?

My measurements if it interests you are 28 underbust &amp; 31.5 bust.  Shallow and bottom heavy boobs.

I know my measurements say I'm a 28C/D.. but I think because of the shape of my boob, I have to go a cup size lower, and when I tried a 28 it was way too tight.

I was trying to help a friend by guessing her bra size (she was too busy to measure during the Nordstrom sale), but I got frustrated by the different cup sizes I was coming up with from sister sizing versus guessing at her raw measurements.

So I started thinking about myself. What bra size should I have been wearing for most of my life? (In the last few years I gained weight.) I specifically remember measuring myself years ago and using the +4 method. The result was 36D. Okay, so probably I should have been in a 32 band, and sister sizing down I get 32E. I'm wearing a 34F now and it's only 2 volume-sizes different, but I didn't think that my boobs grew that much. But let's think about the raw measurements. In order to get 36D I must have measured 32 underbust and 40 bust. Makes sense, I measure about 40/41 now. But wait, that's 32FF! Okay, that makes sense as a sister size to what I'm wearing now, but why I am getting such different results: 32FF or 32E? 2 sizes different? Is something really broken with the way we deal with sister sizes? No, that can't be right! Sister sizes work!

And then I had the epiphany (in the shower, as these things always go). It's so obvious: it's because of +4.

Each band size consists of 2 inches, but each cup size difference only consists of 1 inch. So, when adding +4 you go up 2 band sizes, but you *go down 4 cup sizes*. You gain back two cup sizes, volume wise, simply by going up in the band. Thus, the +4 method actually results in a size that is 2 cup sizes too small.

Granted, if it fits, it fits. And 2 sizes smaller than the measurements indicate may work for some women. *But*, since the majority of women are using the +4 method when they were originally sized, it certainly explains why people so often go up 2+ cup sizes, by volume, when they get resized with our methods.

It's so obvious once it was all laid out properly in my mind!",,False,,t5_2s8kf,False,,,True,t3_1ikn23,http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/1ikn23/sizing_epiphany_or_why_so_many_people_go_up_two/,

1370139998.0,26,self.ABraThatFits,1fhy3e,Tutorial: Add boning to the wings of a bra,,27,1,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/1fhy3e/tutorial_add_boning_to_the_wings_of_a_bra/,"Okay so I'm pretty chubby, and the bands of my bras roll. It's not a size problem, if I go down a size I can't clasp the bra and if I go up 1-2 sizes it still rolls and my boobs fall out the bottoms of the cups if I lift up my arms.

So I got sick of it and sewed boning into the sides of some of my bras. [Here's the entire album of photos](http://imgur.com/a/RLNum) (excuse the duplicates, I suck at imgur. Also excuse my rubble, I have a cold).


**[Materials](http://imgur.com/jfRGGATh?1):**

I got all my weird bra-specific supplies from [corsetmaking.com](http://corsetmaking.com/). They also have bra-making supplies, so I was able to get everything I needed there.

- A bra with a band that tends to roll (mine is a Cleo Rita, which is the same cut as Juna)
- [1/4 inch plastic corset boning](http://corsetmaking.com/category/plastic-boning.html)
- [Underwire channeling](http://corsetmaking.com/bra-notions/BMS-CH01.html) (corsetmaking.com sells black and white, but you can find other colors, or even dye your own if you want)
- Coordinating thread
- Plenty of pins
- Something to sew with -- a needle or a sewing machine

**[Boning Placement](http://imgur.com/vUdpO62h):**

I cut the boning down to size, a little bit shorter than the wing of the bra where I was planning on placing it. I slid it into the underwire channeling and cut that with 1/2 inch of extra on either side, so I could fold it under when I sewed the boning into the bra. You want the boning to be a tiny bit shorter than the wing -- if it's longer it'll bulge out when you wear it, which doesn't look nice.

I chose the placement based on my B.Tempt'd Ciao Bella, which came with boning in the wings. Ideally I suspect I'd want to put it right where that seam in the wing is, but I was afraid the seam + the boning would be too much bulk, so I put it just behind it.

**Hand-Sewing the Boning ([Inside](http://imgur.com/tv7BlDYh), [Outside](http://imgur.com/snmQlRkh)):**

I did a trial with hand-sewing the boning before I machine-sewed it, since my hand-stitching sucks and is looser than a machine stitch so it'd be easier to pull out. However, you could totally just hand-sew it permanently.

I used a backstitch on the vertical (long) seams and a whipstitch over the ends, since that's the direction the band stretches. I also used contrasting thread to make it easier for me to pick out later.

I tried wearing the bra for a couple days with the boning hand-sewn in to make sure it was comfortable and everything, and even my crappy hand sewing held up fine.

**Machine-Sewing Boning ([Inside](http://imgur.com/V3ozx5kh), [Outside](http://imgur.com/1vA8wxOh)):**

I ripped the hand-stitching out and redid it with a machine for more neatness, durability, and matching thread. I was expecting to have trouble sewing the non-seamed side of the underwire channeling, since there's not much extra room over there, but it seemed like the sewing machine needle did a good job of shoving the plastic boning out of the way.

I used a triple stretch stitch on the sides, but a regular straight stitch would probably work fine. I used a zigzag stitch on the top and bottom seams so they wouldn't bust open when the band stretches.

HOPEFULLY this will be reasonably durable and I won't have to redo it every two or three months!",,False,,t5_2s8kf,False,,,True,t3_1fhy3e,http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/1fhy3e/tutorial_add_boning_to_the_wings_of_a_bra/,

You might notice that some greens on their sheet ended up as a No on mine - this is not an error.  They had slightly different definitions for ""fit"" and ""doesn't fit"" than what I do.  Also, please note that theirs is ever-changing. I took a snapshot of their spreadsheet about a week ago or so, and have been using that snapshot for reference.

Total there's 199 bras and 45 different people.  I'm still clarifying a few things with my German contact, so if you see anything weird, it may be because of that.


_____
**Some questions:**

**Padding**

I want to make sure the Padding amount is as clear as possible.  Here's what I went with:

* unlined: When laid down on a table, the bra falls completely flat without effort.  The cup is often see-through.  Example: Cleo Lucy
* lightly lined: When laid down on a table, the bra falls/caves in, but not completely.  You can get it close to flat if you poke at it or squish it down, though.  There's a small amount of thickness to the cups, but not much.  Example: Freya's longlines
* lined/padded: When laid down on a table, the cups retain their shape.  You can wrinkle the cups, though, and you can push them inside-out and they won't usually revert back to their original shape.  Examples: Cleo Juna, most of Ewa Michalak's bras
* moulded: The cups have a well-defined shape.  There's often foam involved.  If you set the bra on a table, the bra retains its original shape.  If you try to poke at the cups, it resists any deformation, and will pop back to its original shape with little-to-no effort.  Examples: Freya Deco Plunge, Cleo Jude
* pushup: There is some sort of padding or bump pad at the base (and sometimes the sides) of the cup, in order to give the breasts some boost.  Examples: Wonderbra Ultimate Strapless, Freya Deco Half Cup

My questions regarding padding:

* Does this make sense to you?
* Do you disagree with any of it?
* Is there a better way to indicate this information?
* Am I flat-out wrong on these descriptions, per general useage?
* Should pushup be in a different category altogether?  Such as a yes/no thing?

**Shape**

Here's my definitions of the different shapes (this is mostly per the Busty Resources Wiki):

* half: In general, this is the smallest coverage.  Also called Demi.
* three-quarters: An average amount of coverage.  Most balconettes fall under this category.
* full: Full-coverage bras.  Very little breast tissue shows outside the cups.
* plunge: A bra that is meant to be worn with a plunging neckline.  The gore is very short and sits at the very bottom of the cups.
* strapless: Any bra that can be worn without straps.
* sports: Any bras meant to be worn while working out.  Generally they are made to keep breasts from moving around while exercising.

My questions regarding shape/style:

* Does this make sense to you?
* Do you disagree with any of it?
* Am I flat-out wrong on these descriptions, per general useage?
* I understand that the line between a lot of these shapes is fairly blurry.  Is there any way to help differentiate between these styles?

_____

**Some Requests:**

* I would be incredibly grateful if you could take a look at my padding/style designations and call me out on anything that is ridiculously off.  i.e. I called a bra lined/padded when it's definitely unlined.  If you want to argue across a fuzzy line (ie, between half and three-quarters), provide me with a compelling argument and I'll probably change it for you.

* If there's some bras that can be combined (like many of the Cleo bras) into a single entry, let me know.  For example: are the Freya Carys and Just Flew In longlines identical?  Can they be combined?

* If there's any bra names that are ambiguous, can you point them out and tell me how to make them unambiguous?  For example, just putting ""Fauve Merissa"" would not be good enough, as it comes in both a balcony and a half cup.

* This last one is entirely due to my curiosity.  If you know you have a store/boutique near you that has a Cleo Jude in your size, would you mind going and trying it out?  I am definitely not asking anyone to buy/order it because of me.  I'm just curious if the Jude, which is universally regarded as The Bra That Fits No One, sometimes works for shallow breasts (as 2 of 3 people in the spreadsheet found it worked for them).

_____

**Last Remarks**

Here's my general guidelines for the spreadsheet:

Fits:  The cup is the right width and depth, and does not cut in at the top.  There's no wrinkling or gaping anywhere.  The cups are a reasonable height and don't dig/pinch, especially in the armpit area.

Does not fit: The opposite of everything in the Fits category.

Irrelevant: You don't like the shape the bra gives you.  The straps don't adjust long/short enough.  You could use one bandsize smaller (but they don't make it in the bandsize you need), but otherwise it fits.  The lace shows through your shirt.  The sides of the cups show through the armpit hole of your tank top.

* If you are currently on the spreadsheet and the above guidelines make you realize a No should be a Yes (or vice versa), let me know and I'll change it.

* If you are currently on the spreadsheet and have tried on some new bras since we last communicated, let me know and I'll add them.

* If you are not on the spreadsheet and wish to be (and have shallow breasts, lol), send me a detailed list of the bras that work and do not work for you (like the responses [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/1e2r7d/abtf_i_want_to_add_a_bit_more_information_to_the/)).

I was successful in convincing her sister-in-law (my aunt) to let me measure her, and my aunt went from a 40C to a 36E. My mother (in-law) has a smaller underbust than my aunt so now that she knows that her sister (in-law) is different only by a cup bigger, I may have some leverage to either let me measure her or to get measured by a trusted boutique.

Now, I'm a pretty regular Land's End customer because, despite their general attitude that clothing size is like the pirate code, they're very petites friendly. But when I pulled the suit back out of storage yesterday to make some alterations, I realized just HOW far off they could get.

I only wore the suit twice last year. I got some armpit blub (because a DDD is technically too small for me, but anything bigger than a 6 at LE was too big, because did I mention pirate code?). That wasn't too bothersome, but I had also noticed that the underbust band was loose enough to buckle. I wanted to take a tuck or two in it to compensate.

So out comes the trusty tape measure. Turns out the suit measures 36"" at the apex of the bust (which matches the size guide [**EDIT** whoops, for the regular size 6, not the DDD, so there's that Land's End magic!]), with a little leeway because the suit is open there above the keyhole back.

Then at the strap...hm. 32"" unstretched. Well, that's starting at a 32D...which...okay...

Aaaaaand **44"" stretched.**

That's...gonna be too much elastic to take in, I think.

I ran across MWB's post sometime last year, did some measuring but that was it. I've known for quite sometime I was wearing the wrong size. In fact it had actually gotten to the point where I had given up on regular bras because they were physically painful for me to wear. I've been wearing (cheap)sports bras for well over 6 months now, except for when I knew I would only have to wear my torture device bras(VS 38C) for a short amount of time. 

I had measured myself at a 34FF/G originally, but I've lost some weight since then(yay!). The lady at Nordstrom measured me as a 34E/F, which I think is right based on my initial measurement and the weight loss. I purchased 3 Freya bras(Deco, Patsy, Ivy longline) while I was at Nordstrom after confirming with the lady who helped me and my BFF that the girls were in their proper place. 

My only issue with my new bra size is that it feels tight! I know that's how its supposed to be because I can tell that the band is supporting the majority of the load, and I barely feel the shoulder straps(yay!). The 34 band isn't painful, its just tighter than what I'm used to. Hell I'm not accustomed to wearing a real bra anymore. I picked up some extenders last night to help get me used to the bras, and I can feel that its less supportive with the extender on. I guess what I'd like to know is how long does it take to really be comfortable with your new size? And is it normal for me to feel a bit constricted at first in my new bras?

So after the third try, I re-bought the Cleo Lucy and Juna in a 28DD instead of the 28Ds I tried the first time. The wires definitely fit much better with these! I do get some cup gaping, but in the Lucy, I think I can alter the lace just a tiny bit to prevent that. In the Juna, it's not all that major, and I think insignificant enough to ignore it? You can see the outline of the cup a bit through my shirt, but I guess you can't really avoid that unless you buy bras specifically designed not to do that. Or am I wrong?

So, worth keeping these or no?

I liked her visuals a lot because they very clearly show how important the scoop and swoop is in determining if a bra fits or not. But I am not 100% sure its the best link as she doesn't explain how to do it right there in her blog post (though she does link to the Busty Resources Wiki) and am concerned that because she is so busty those with smaller busts might not relate to it or see how important scoop and swoop is for them too. I know I've seen a few posts from women on here saying something along the lines of ""I'm so small, I don't think it is necessary"" and that's not an idea I want to inadvertently reinforce by showing only images of a super busty lady doing the scoop and swoop. The other option is linking to the Busty Resources page on scoop and swoop directly. Thoughts and comments are appreciated =) 

Also: Please don't forget to tag posts that contain pictures of breasts NSFW (even if they're in a bra) as well as any links that could potentially be NSFW =)

A long while back, she mentioned how her 34DD bras were riding up and not fitting anymore, attributing this problem to her new-ish birth control. I told her that I didn't think she was really a 34DD with the support of a friend who wears a properly fitted 36F.

Somehow she got fitted at a store where the woman apparently ""just looks at you and KNOWS your size""... Into a B cup. I wish I knew which band, but I was so shocked at her being sized into ANY sort of B cup when a 34DD is too small and rides up. This must be one of the worst fittings of all time! She says she likes the bra, but I told her she can get a MUCH better fit. If I had to venture a guess, I would put her around a 30FF. She said she doesn't feel comfortable with me measuring her without a bra, but I told her I'd teach her how to measure herself. I'll measure her band for her, though, and I can probably get a very rough estimate starting point by measuring over a poorly fitting bra and some guesswork.

Another friend was involved in the conversation and basically BEGGED me to measure her, size her, put her into something that FITS! She wears a 36D now and KNOWS that she is not a D, that she's definitely bigger and needs something better. Needless to say, I jumped at the opportunity and invited her to come over and I'll measure her! I am rather excited about this, because I feel that she'll really listen when I try to educate all about bras. I am comfortable enough that I don't mind showing her my own bras(as well as the ill-fitting bras I own to point out certain fit issues) as well as showing her how to physically scoop and swoop. My only hope is that she is still in a size range sold in Nordstrom or other stores!

There's a fifth gal in our friend circle(including me, the two above, and the gal in the 36F who I mentioned in the beginning)... Who is not in the right size either. I can see through shirts that the tops of her bras cut in and the band is too big. She is very obviously full on top, so I'm putting her around a 30E just eyeballing it and probably needing freya halfcups or masquerade rhea or something similar, anything open on top(not sure about projection on the bottom though). I haven't spoken to her about bra related things yet... but I plan to convert the above 2, then move on to her...

Contours was different. The two ladies working were the best and most honest people I've ever met. They carried a ton of sizes (whoo, 28G here!) and a huge selection in those sizes.

I'm unsure of how it works other places, but the manager personally takes you to a fitting room, finds a single size that fits you perfectly with stock bras (after measuring of course) and then brings an entire arm full of different types of bras for you to try.

The manager was able to find out all the issues in the bras I had been wearing (my underwire was too narrow, which caused painful boobage, and other such instances), and find the perfect type of bra for my boobs. It rocked.

Both ladies were supportive and helpful the entire time, honest if something didn't fit right, and bubbling when it did. They were both great, and I'll definitely be going back when I need a strapless bra around prom time.

We have some really great links and information there already but it can be hard for newcomers to navigate through it and know what they should be looking for, and we tend to get some of the same questions very frequently.

Some things we will be adding: 

* A visual âhow to measureâ guide. This will also include what a properly fitting bra will look like, answers to questions like ""should I exhale or inhale when measuring?"", and the scoop and swoop Hopefully something on breast shape too though that may just be a link to bratabaseâs shape section or it may be done separately from this guide. 

* An ""advanced"" fitting guide based off the techniques used at http://busenfreundinnen.net/ (it will require more measurements and knowledge to use, which is why I referred to it as advanced) it is ***not*** going to replace MyWifesBusty's fitting guide, but it will serve as an additional resource and an alternative method for those that are really interested in bra fitting, or if for some reason someone finds MWBâs guide doesnât give an accurate result, and wish to try it out. It will be written by t_maia, who contributes here a lot and has been a fitter at busenfreundinnen for a number of years. The fitters at that site, despite being a community based site like us, have to go through several months of training before being allowed to offer advice so I trust her expertise.

* Info and resources on altering your bras

* I'm hoping to make another post in a little while asking the question ""What was your bra size then and what is it now?"" so that you all can share your stories on how finding your right bra size has made you happier and more comfortable, and it will hopefully help other ladies that are a bit intimidated by the size they measure out as realize it is perfectly normal! =) I will also include these two pictures there too: http://bfcidade.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/naprawde-duze-biusty2.jpg and http://img237.imageshack.us/img237/3075/akcjanagfina.jpg Of course you guys keep making your own posts about your experiences, I don't want to see those kinds of posts stop showing up on the subreddit, they're always inspiring and nice to read =) But be sure to add your stories to the mod post as well when it shows up just so we can have all the stories in one place in the sidebar. If you want to include before and after pictures too that would be awesome, but not at all necessary if you don't feel comfortable with it. You can also just post before and after in your shirt too, it proves the point just as well and you aren't exposing as much skin. =)

* A welcome to /r/ABraThatFits! message and explanation of what this subreddit does and why it is important, and where to start for new comers, I may add this on to either the visual fitting guide or the bra size then v.s. now post.

So, what are your thoughts on this? Is there anything you would like to add or change? =) Please do us a favor and give us your favorite links! Anything that you think has helpful information about bras or bra fitting you think we can use to make the sidebar better =) It will not all come at once, and will probably be slow going but we've already added a link to /r/braswap (please subscribe! It doesn't have many subscribers now but I'm sure if more of our community joins it can start getting a good amount of activity) and the before/after post should be coming soon =)

And on another note, we had a little issue recently where one of our members posted a link to a comment on another subreddit that was written by a former bra fitter that was talking a little bit about bras. What resulted was that a number of our members tried to talk to her about bra fitting, things got a little confrontational and a few trolls used it as an excuse to send her hate mail. She got really shook up by it and was made to feel horrible about herself, which she didnât deserve no matter who said what or what the intention was. There are no new rules or anything, you can still post links here to comments like that in other subreddits but please consider that if there is already one person recommending that they should visit r/abrathatfits or that their fitting method is wrong or they are wearing the wrong size, it is probably not necessary for 5 more people to come and say the same thing and that it may be more helpful to reply with âyeah, that subreddit really helped me, by bras are so comfortable nowâ or âwhat she says is true because of blah blah blahâ etc. so that it doesnât unintentionally become confrontational if the person starts feeling as if they are being berated by us. We donât want to make others feel bad about the way they fit bras or how their bras fit them, to make them feel guilty or self-conscious because they did not know what you know, I donât think itâs any better than others making us feel bad about our bodies because they couldnât fit us right or donât carry our size or because they think we are too big or too small. What we do want them to do is get a positive impression of us as a subreddit so that they visit us and change their mind! =) Just use your best judgement and try to remember bras can be a touchy subject, and I'm sure everything will turn out fine. =)

Here is an account of my experience with the store.",DaisyDoodles,26,1,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/u3bxt/everyone_says_bravissimo_is_fantastic_for/,"I was first measured at [Bravissimo](http://www.bravissimo.com/) about a year and a half ago (aged 14). I went in wearing a 38D with my arms folded over my chest and a cloud over my head.

The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the staff. They turned to smile as my mother and I walked in the door, and I realised...*They all have big boobs too! But their clothes don't sit weirdly like mine do...*

My mother walked with me up to the front desk, and asked politely if they would be able to fit me in for a fitting. The woman behind the desk smiled and asked me if I had been fitted before.

I had indeed, but all my previous fittings had been at Marks &amp; Spencers. She told me that her store did things a little differently to stores like M&amp;S.

We walked upstairs to the fitting rooms, and as we did the clerk described how it was done.

""We don't use measuring tapes here, your size is calculated by seeing how your current bra fits you and letting you try on our bras until you find something that looks and feels comfortable.""

The staff are all incredibly friendly, and I already felt at ease. I had to wait for about ten minutes before I could get in, but it was worth the wait.

The fitters are great at putting their customers at ease, and most importantly they know what they're talking about. She pointed out places where it was obvious that my current bra was no good- bulging over the tops of the cups, straps digging in to my shoulders, the middle of my bra hanging off my body rather than lying flat against my chest- and brought out a selection of bras for me to try on.

I instantly felt better. I told the fitter that yes, this was perfect, and she noted down my new size on a card for me to take out with me.

My poor mother ended up spending almost Â£100 on bras that day, but *what a difference!*

I left the store with tears of joy in my eyes. As soon as I got home I changed into one of my new bras, and marveled at the complete change to my figure. I had gone from a 38C to a 34E, and it did wonders for my self esteem.

I am now a 34G, and I owe most of the confidence I have to the wonderful staff and beautiful products of Bravissimo.

I tried a few bras today besides my old standby and favorite bra the Ciao Bella, with mixed results.

The [How Gorgeous Tshirt Bra](http://btemptd.wacoal-america.com/shop/bras/underwire/b-tempt-d-how-gorgeous-t-shirt-bra_953119.html?index=4&amp;searchCategoryId=10021&amp;totalResults=17&amp;displayMarkdownsOnly=false) was the bra I'd been wanting to try most and the one I most hoped would work. Unfortunately this is a *weird* bra. The cup is very shallow at the bottom, but becomes much deeper toward the top before angling abruptly inward. It reminds me a bit of the Cleo Jude except in a halfcup shape instead of a plunge. It gapped about an inch below the rim on me, and then cut into breast tissue at the upper edge. It seems like it would be extremely difficult to fit. 

The [La Parisienne Pushup Underwire Bra](http://btemptd.wacoal-america.com/shop/bras/underwire/b-tempt-d-la-parisienne-push-up-underwire-bra_958157.html?index=15&amp;searchCategoryId=10021&amp;totalResults=17&amp;displayMarkdownsOnly=false) has removable cookies doing the pushup, so you can remove them if you like. This is slightly deeper than the Ciao Bella, but is still a good cut for shallow shapes. Particularly if you find some of the usual shallow cuts a bit too shallow for you, this might be a good fit. It's quite open on the top, has a single vertical seam, and has that nice straight-across halfcup shape that works well for shallow breasts. The shape seems more rounded than the Ciao Bella, and the pushup pads are definitely aiming for cakes-on-a-plate cleavage. The gore is a bit wider than I'd prefer.

The [Full Bloom Underwire](http://btemptd.wacoal-america.com/shop/bras/underwire/b-tempt-d-full-bloom-underwire-bra_951133.html?index=12&amp;searchCategoryId=10021&amp;totalResults=17&amp;displayMarkdownsOnly=false) is a stretch lace balconette. The cups aren't seamed, they're just a single piece of stretch lace. I think there might be a dart in it. Surprisingly for a shape like this, it doesn't cut in -- I think the lace is too stretchy. Because of the lack of seaming, it probably wouldn't offer sufficient support to larger or softer breasts (but since it's only offered up to 36DDD I do not foresee that being a big issue). However, if you have smaller, shallower breasts and are looking for a decent unpadded bra, this would be a good one to attempt. Also it was super comfy.

...of course the only bra I came home with was another Ciao Bella in a different color. 9_9",,False,,t5_2s8kf,1374116328.0,,,True,t3_1iizlp,http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/1iizlp/shallow_shape_adventures_with_btemptd/,

They carry bands from 28 (didn't get what bands they carry up to, sorry!) and go up to cup N. Mostly they carry Curvy Kate and Goddess, but there were other brands. Its part of a bridal store, so the bras are mostly nude, white and black. The prices didn't seem unreasonable, one I tried on was $44.

Found out from a gal working at the downtown Macy's that Audrey's just started to carry 28 bands, so I thought I'd go check it out. She also said that they will make custom bras, but I didn't verify that. 

Mixed reviews on the help. My sister was helped by a woman named Suzan who sounded like she was great. My sister was fitted for her very first correctly sized bra (30HH), yay for her! I was helped by two women, one who very nice, but admitted she didn't have any ideas about how to help with my uncommon breast shape, and another woman who was their ""certified"" bra expert. Well, she fitted me for a 34D, because the 30 and 32 was way too tight, it was leaving red marks! Hrm. And she thought a bra was good even though there was quad boob and empty space inside (moulded bra). She didn't listen to anything I had to say, told me bra extenders are bad, and told the other woman not to get me a particular bra because she knew I wouldn't like it anyway. In her defense, I have weird boobs, and wasn't expecting to find anything, but I was miffed.

I knew I had gotten bigger so I was desperate. I was so happy buying these bras and they fit perfectly in the store..

...but alas it was short lived. It's so embarrassing sitting down and knowing that there is a bump showing between my boobs through my shirt. When I sit down (sometimes even when I'm standing too) my boobs push the gore forward...and because I'm short, you see it. I mean, the gore of the bra is so high that I can't even have any cleavage. 

The only way I get cleavage is by buying a bra that's too small! The only cleavage I get from a bra that supposedly fits is a damn bump.

Ok I'm a very big girl...Over 300 lbs. I'm 28 and my boobs are completely natural. Also they are full on top according to [this post](http://brasihate.blogspot.se/2013/02/clarifying-breast-shape-full-on-top-vs.html). Here are the measurements from the visual fitting guide:

1. Underbust loose: 49""
2. Underbust tight: 44""
3. Upright: 59""
4. Leaning: 60""
5. Laying down: 56""

The bra that I bought multiples of in different colours was the **Elomi 42J US ""Caitlyn""**.

What's strange to me is that the 42 feels so comfy. I always end up with that band size. When I get a fitting done by professionals...they always bring me 46K or 48K... The problem is that those are loose on me and the cup size is so big it overtakes my entire chest to the point where the gore is almost at my neck! ...Or at least it seems that way.

Also, I'm frustrated that bras want to separate my boobs. They're huge and don't want to do that naturally... 

Does anyone have any advice for me or any ideas on some other brands I could look into? Thank you!

So I sent it back with a note explaining I had found a better fit since - well I have, just not the right fit! - and asking for a refund.

I was phoned today and basically told that the only option was to go back to the store and be refitted and accept an exchange.  No refunds.  Ever.

I put the bra on band first, then put on the straps, and was impressed at how well the bra stayed up even without the help of straps.  This seemed like a great sign, since I don't think I've ever had a bra that could do that.  Based on all of my (limited) experience with trying on bras, the 28B seems to fit quite well, and my boobs actually look good for the first time ever.

The problem, however, is that I'm finding the new band size rather painful.  I know you're only supposed to be able to fit two fingers under the band, and I have room for a bit more than that, but it still feels incredibly tight.  The straps also seem to dig into my shoulders, even when they feel pretty loose.  After wearing this bra around the house for a couple hours, I was sore enough that I couldn't wait to take it off.  Is this something that I'll just get used to as I grow more accustomed to a properly fitted bra?  Or does it mean that this size doesn't actually fit?

I realize it would be more helpful if I posted pictures, but I'm not totally comfortable doing so, despite internet anonymity and all that.

Edit:  For those of you asking, my measurements are 29 tight underbust, 32 overbust (i think this was an average of tight and loose measurements, though there wasn't much difference).  I tried on all the bras again, and the 28B just fits like a fairytale.  I have a really shallow/wide root, which I think accounts for the smaller cup size.  I'm only slightly worried that I should be planning ahead for tissue migration.  Do you ladies plan ahead for these things, or just buy lots of different sizes of bras until all the tissue has migrated to the right place?  I don't think I have a ton of migrating to do, but there is absolutely no room in the 28B for any growth.

I've tried to translate it for you, I apologies in advance for the wall of text:


&gt; Lingerie chain Change convicted of sex discrimination, according to the judgment of the Labour Court.

&gt; Change folds in the Labour Court for sex discrimination. It was wrong to force a clerk to wear a nametag that &gt; revealed her bra size.

&gt; - It feels really nice to have a conviction, says Evelina, who faced down the tag.

&gt; When she started in one of Changes shops, she was informed that besides her name, her bra size would be &gt; listed on her tag.

&gt; - I asked directly why I would have my bra size on it, but was told that's the way it was, she said.

&gt; The company claimed that it was voluntarily to wear the tag. But Evelina felt that it was mandatory, and that &gt; it was very offensive to her. She eventually left the company.

&gt; The trade union Handels sued Change and demanded a total of SEK 300 000 to Evelina in compensation for &gt;  discrimination and violation of collective agreement. Handels also demanded SEK 100 000 for violation of the &gt; collective agreement.

&gt; On Wednesday the Labour Court rulings, that can not be appealed, came it.

&gt; Change has to pay 50,000 kronor in compensation for discrimination to Evelina. According to the court, it was &gt; clear that she had never been exposed to the tag requirement if she was not just a woman.

&gt; That she did not get as much compensation as she had applied to does not matter.

&gt; - It's not for the money that I did it but to put my foot down and say that now, enough is enough.

&gt; The court also decided that the Swedish Trade Association and Change together shall pay 75 percent of the &gt; court costs. However, it rejected Handels claim for breach of the collective agreement.

&gt; Jaana Palsson, first Ombudsman of Handels in Sundsvall, is very pleased with the ruling.

&gt; - There is a pleasing ruling, it's really, really good for our members who have been able run this case.

&gt; Pia SchÃ¶ldstrÃ¶m, labor lawyer representing Change, notes that they have not reached all the way.

&gt; - The company said it was voluntarily to wear the tag, but we did not prove it.

&gt; Meanwhile SchÃ¶ldstrÃ¶m not completely unsatisfied with the outcome.

&gt; - From claiming 400,000, it became SEK 50 000 in damages and adjusted legal fees.


So why is this such a bad thing? I've been to this store(yes, the actual store that the plaintiff worked at) many times and they're great fitters and really lovely women. I love that they show their sizes on their name tags.

(I figure I'll go in again in a few more weeks' time, to see if I've stopped changing, and *then* I'll buy my new bras. I don't want to spend much now, only to find that I've gone up another cup size or two within the next month, you know?

So. I've been going to this shop for years and they are generally good at measuring and fitting, and I've been pleased with all the bras I've bought there. I like supporting the local business, and I like the help they've given me with fit issues and questions over the years. However, my eyes are opening a little wider after spending time in this subreddit...

I get stripped down to my cami and bra in the fitting room, and the fitter comes in and measures me, as per their usual procedure. 

She says that according to her measurements, I'm still the same size as I always was (between 34F/FF, depending on the cut). I pull down the cami and show her that the gore of the bra isn't tacking against my chest, and that my boobs are actually pushing the band away from my ribcage. I pointed out that the bra was forcing the tissue up and down, so the circumference hadn't changed, so long as I was wearing my old bra. 

She went and fetched some 34Gs for me to try, and lo and behold, they fit me -- some were even too tight. Interestingly, she couldn't predict that sizing from her measurements in the store, but that was exactly what I had predicted, based on the measuring guidelines here.

I'm convinced now that I've always been wearing the wrong sizes, but it wasn't until I got pregnant ~2 years ago that I became painfully aware of just how wrong. I'd been wearing 32B for a while because that's what seemed to fit (not that I knew anything about ""fit,"" it was just the most comfortable to me). After I got pregnant my breasts grew, so I went to Victoria's Secret to get measured (silly me, I know, but remember I didn't know anything) and was told I was a 34B. That was after being measured...WITH MY BRA ON. YES, THE SAME BRA THAT NO LONGER FIT ME. Being an idiot, I took her word for it, and just ended up with another bra that didn't fit.

Then after I had the baby and started breastfeeding NOTHING fit anymore, I tried various sizes from my old 32B to 36/38C, not really understanding how the sizing worked and being perpetually confused at the method of measuring I'd been taught.  

But then I found you, you wonderful, wonderful bra ladies of the internet, and all my confusion evaporated. Using the clear and brilliant fitting guide posted a while back I measured at a solid 30D (30/31"" underbust, 34"" bust). I was skeptical for a while and kept referring back here, just reading and gathering information, until I finally took a chance and ordered 2 bras from Amazon and whaddya know, they DID fit. One fits better than the other shape-wise, but both fit quite well size-wise.

Things I love most about the bra: The underwires are VERY narrow, as narrow as I've experienced thus far, and this works well for my boobs. The cups are supportive. I like the shape. I feel very pretty in the bra, and that's important, right?! The gore itself is pretty narrow, which I also like. My boobs feel gathered and lifted.

Leading up to my trip I was getting really excited about going there and my boyfriend gave me some money so I could treat myself. Today I went there and it was easily the WORST bra fitting experience I've ever had :/

I went in and spoke to a woman about needing something in the bigger sizes and she asked if I'd like to be fitted, I thought ""why the hell not"" and said yes so she took me to the change rooms and pulled out a tape measure. she took my underbust measurement (very loosely) and then took the bust measurement and turned to the chart she had hanging on the wall at which point I said ""I usually wear an 8G"". She replied with ""You're probably a 12DD so I'll grab some things and we'll see how it goes.""
She mentioned that she was in training so I didn't want to be harsh and I figured if anything, this would be a good learning experience for her so I agreed, knowing that none of those would fit me.
They didn't and so they went down in a bandsize and still didn't fit me. I was pointing out all the things I could see that were wrong, such as the gore not lying flat and the band riding up and the crazy amounts of spillage happening over the top. 
Eventually she put me in a 10E and then got her manager to have a look. The manager said that the band was quite tight to which I replied it was actually quite loose and she told me that I was wrong.
Then for the next 45 minutes they kept putting me in things that were the wrong sizes, telling me that the cup spillage was how it's supposed to sit and that the centre gore was lying nice and flat even when there was a gap big enough to stick my finger through.

By the end of it they'd tried absolutely everything on me (hats off for effort) and nothing had fit and I left empty handed. I was really disappointed considering they had a sign out the front saying they went up to a J cup. The worst part was the way they denied everything I told them about how un/comfortable something was or how it made my breasts look flat because my breasts don't suit that particular style.

The underwire really is supposed to lay flat to your ribs? Mine hangs onto my underboob area. 
Scoop and Swoop? My method has been smoosh and tuck. 
Bra band doesn't even go horizontal around my body, it goes up in the back. 

I just went to the bathroom, tried the proper method of putting on a bra, and now my boobs won't stay in the bra, the nipples are barely staying in.  My boobs have also always pressed against each other in the bra while at the same time pushing the bra out enough that they get in the way of arm movements. I'm guessing that's a no-no. 

Tomorrow I'm going to find my measuring tape, get a proper measure on myself and start the hunt for a new bra. I'll probably post pictures too for extra help.

The associate recommended I get the 30 and after a few wears the band will stretch slightly and become more comfortable.

It is so tight. It fits like a glove, but when I inhale or slouch even slightly the underwire presses on my ribs painfully (in a bruising way). I've seen the article about bending the wire into a more natural shape but that didn't really change anything for me.

I'm only wearing it for the 2nd time today so I assume it is being ""broken in"", but is it true that it will become more comfortable? I'm getting used to the tightness, but am skeptical that it will stop bruising my ribs. What are your experiences with your tight bands?

I just returned a whole load of 30As to VS because of crazy gaping issues and totally awkward non-compatible with me shapes/styles.

Okay here we go.

1. Rotation. It is very important to rotate your bras. The band of a bra (and sometimes the cups!) contain a large amount of elastic. If you wear it everyday, the elastic will never get a chance to bounce back, it will just stretch and stretch and stretch and stretch. I like to recommend that every woman possess at least three bras. One for wearing, two for the wash. And if she is active.. a sports bra of course. The more often you rotate your bra, the longer it will last. 

To that end, if you find the band of your bra has stretched out on you but the cups are still a lovely fit, you can always consider having it taken in by a seamstress. There is really no point in throwing away a great bra because the band is too loose! Especially considering the price of some of the bras busty ladies have to pay. 

2. Hand washing. This is the most important thing. Even in a lingerie bag, on the gentle cycle, your bra can get damaged. Typically what happens is that the lingerie bag collapses into the bra, and the underwire gets jostled around like crazy. IF YOU MUST machine wash, I personally recommend the bra ball.  But again, that much agitation isn't really great for bras.

What I use, and like to tell other people to use, is actually a knitters wash. Most knitters detergents are formulated to have a no agitation no rinse formula, because wool will felt if you agitate it, and rinsing is a pain.

The one I use is [soak](http://www.soakwash.com/) which is really great. All I do is fill my sink with cold water, add a few drops, and let it soak for like 10 minutes. I take it out and hang it to dry. 

Eucelan also works quit nicely! Alternatively, if you can't find a knitters wash, baby shampoo or ivory or dove soap works quite nicely. You really just want to use something as gentle as possible. 

Even if you machine wash, you ALWAYS always always want to hang your bras to dry, I always tell people to hang them from the center gore, because if you hang it by the straps they will stretch out so much faster.

The more often you wash your bras, the longer they will last! Washing your bra will help the elastic bounce back much faster, and on top of that will get the sweat and oils from your body out of your bra. The sweat and oils from our bodies actually break down the elastic much faster. Ideally a bra should get washed every wear, but it's generally okay to wear it 2-3 times before you wash it, provided that you are rotating it and giving it time to rest of course. 

3. Storage!  Storage really isn't a huge deal unless you wear the moulded cup tshirt style bras. In which case you want to store them sunny side up as much as possible and avoid flipping the cups into one another. I find it easiest to hang those kinds of bras up in my closest instead of putting them in a drawer, they take up much less space that way.

Anyway, I've followed these instructions for a long time now, and I find my bras on average last me 2-4 years depending on the make. (I tend to only own around 5 bras at a time, including sports, so this is a long time.)

So I've been subbed to this community for over 7 months now. When I first started lurking here it really opened my eyes and for Christmas my boyfriend took me for a professional fitting and for the first time in my life (I'm 23), I was wearing bras that actually fit.

Fast forward 3 months, the bands have already stretched out and tissue migration has made the cups way too small. I spend the next 3 months dropping A LOT of money at BraStop to have about 3 bras come in every 2-3 weeks or so, to have NONE of them fit, despite constantly measuring myself. Finally found some reprieve with the Elomi Asia in 38G, but the gore didn't tack (was about an inch off of my sternum). So I ordered the same bra but solid color in a 38GG but had gapping at the bottom of the cup.

I also ordered a bra from Braologie in this timeframe that very much DID NOT FIT and was a really long and drawn out process. I don't think it was for me. 

So here I am. Almost 8 months into the process and starting all over again. I'm very frustrated. Most of the bras I've tried on have really skinny bands (only 2 or 3 rows) that aren't good for plus size women like me because I have tissue around my ribcage that's fat, not breast tissue. I need a thicker band to give me a smoother silhouette and not give me MORE fat rolls. 

ANYWAY, here are my measurements:

**Underbust break the tape**: 36 inches

**Standing up straight overbust**: appx. 47 inches

**Standing up leaning parallel to the floor overbust**: 50 inches

**Laying down overbust**: 47 inches

**Breast shape**: Full on top

**Other info**: High root, wide root, significant slope, not much projection, narrow shoulders, short torso/chest area I'm only 5'3

I understand this isn't ""normal"" for most posts, but I want to provide as much info as possible to get the best fit and size advice.

As I pointed out in my [other thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/1hldec/rules_question_fitting_question_bra_fitting_for/), I have a wonderful wife who is very supportive of my interest and desire to wear a bra. Since this wonderful breakthrough in our marriage and communication, I've collected a few bras:

* [Bali Double Support Lace Wirefree with Spa Closure - 36B](http://www.onehanesplace.com/outlet/bras/bali-bra/bali-double-support-reg%3B-lace-wirefree-bra-with-spa-closure)

I've also got some sort of cheap sports bra with removable foam pads that I got at Wal-Mart, but I'm not terribly fond of it.

Now, the bras I have are all wonderful, and my wife has even said that she thinks the 2 Bali bras are super comfortable, but being a flat-chested dude, they're not really doing much for me in regards to fit.

From what I've read, those of us with shallow breasts should aim for the single vertical seam in the bra cups, but even still those seem like they wouldn't do well for me. I really have no issues with padding them with something, whether it's socks or if I should ever get some proper breastforms, but I'd really like to find something that I could wear all day under my normal clothes (which is usually an undershirt and a polo or button-up) without being noticed.

My lovely wife has suggested that I just roll with what I've got and let people think that I may just be overweight and have the excess fat in the boobs to use as my excuse, but well-rounded boobs just don't quite look right on a dude like me. 

As you can see, I do like the plain yet definitely feminine looking bras. I don't really have any major interest in finding something like what is marketed as ""for men"", as they're usually very very girly looking (pink lace, etc.). Can I get some help here with suggestions?

Also, my wife believes that I wouldn't be happy with underwire bras.

The cup on the Nina was close to perfect, but didn't tack, so I probably need a cup up. The cup on the Louisa was HUGE. I had a massive gap at the top.

I emailed Paulina to see about the return/exchange process. If it's not favorable, I will measure &amp; post on Bratabase.

Alright ladies, I've taken your feedback and drafted two surveys that I think will help to create a spreadsheet (and hopefully some day a web accessible, searchable database) that will help bra wearers of all shapes and sizes to make informed decisions about what bra(s) they can anticipate will fit.

Now, I'd like your opinions and critiques (harsh, constructive criticism welcome and encourage) on the two surveys:

* [Survey Part 1](http://imgur.com/9XXqBlK): Intent of this survey is to gather information about the bra wearer's characteristics, e.g., breast shape, shallowness, root width, etc.  Part 1 is separate from part 2 so that people won't have to answer these questions more than once/skip through a large portion of the survey.  Should any of these questions be reworded?  Different answers/scales?

* [Survey Part 2](http://imgur.com/MOqgSgL): Intent of this survey is to answer determine how the bra fits a given bra wearer.  I think a happy medium is to ask whether a bra fits in different dimensions (i.e., bottom of the cup) and have a 1-3 scale (Yes-Somewhat-No) and then a follow up question that drills into WHY it doesn't fit.  Are there additional measures that I should be capturing in this survey? Additional options that should be standard (I included an other option for many of the questions to allow for variation from the ""standard"" responses).

Once I have everyone's feedback incorporated, I'll bring these surveys live and start a comprehensive excel sheet to share with everyone.

I decided to take it apart and make some heavy alterations to it, and with the help of my mum, I have a much better (although not great) finished product. If they'd had an unpadded style, I think I would have got a much nicer finished product, but the first SM bra came out literally days after I'd placed my order.

[Here's the process and finished product!](http://imgur.com/a/0d0B1) NSFW obviously. I kind of smoothed out my face to censor a bit, I don't actually have a chin like that. :)

I probably would have taken more photos of the process, but I forgot to pack my camera with my sewing gear when I went to mum's house.

* I unpicked the strap and side elastic (and the lace at the top)
* Moved the strap into a more natural position
* Sewed the strap in place
* Cut down the side of the bra
* Sewed the side elastic to the strap and re-attached lace
* Reduced the stretched length by sewing some ribbon over some of the band

My thoughts on the finished product? It's kind of ugly, but fairly comfortable. I actually have a bra that I'm not spilling out of the top of now! I feel like this kind of alteration would work much better on a bra which didn't have foam cups because you could put a dart in the side to get rid of the excess top side fabric. It does look a bit strange under a tight shirt because of this bagginess.

The wires seem to sit out too far from the sides of my body, so they rub against my breasts as I move around. I know it's cheating, but do people think that I could tighten up the back of the bra more so that it would pull the wires back and in a little? I know I could comfortably wear it if it was tighter than it is now. I'm also not super sure if it's sitting on breast root in the photos or if I have backwards migrated tissue. I'm also not sure if the cup is now a tiny bit small (in the parts which fit, not the excess gather at the side), or I spill into the centre a bit because of the lack of side support and the fact that my breasts naturally want to sit in the centre. I fill out all of the bottom of the bra and the cups don't wrinkle.

Is it really worth expending all this effort? For most people, probably not.

Oh my god it fits like a glove. It doesn't gap when leaning over, doesn't gap when raising my arms, doesn't gap when standing.

There's no extra padding, just lightly lined.  
It's labeled as a balconette but not sure if it's a true balconette? I can never tell. Seems like a cross between a plunge and a balconette. I have no idea why this bra is working for me; I usually have empty space up towards the top (where bra meets strap) and I usually have serious gapping when I lean over.

I measured myself again today and got a half inch less than before.  Underbust 27.5, bust standing 30.5, bust leaning 31.

Anyway, the Lepel seems to fit, I had to shorten the straps more than usual to flatten the cups a bit.  And the bit of padding helps.  Might try the Lepel Fiore Balconette in 30B?

I currently wear a 38D. I followed the MyWifesBusty guide and I should be wearing a 34F.  There's a (pricey) store in the city that sells larger sizes, and has a great reputation for finding the right size for you.  So I went, quite excited.

The woman takes a look at me, top off, bra on, then goes to grab a few options.  She comes back - all 34, we're off to a great start.

They're all C-D cup.  Significantly smaller than what I'm wearing comfortably now!  I don't think my running bra compresses as well as these things.  Thanks to these guides I was able to avoid the following:

The middle wasn't flat against my chest. She said that was normal - my rib bones were just pushing it out, it never lays flat on anyone.

I had breast tissue in the bra... and everywhere else.  Under my arms, quad boob... in one, even out the bottom as they couldn't fit.  Don't even try scoop and swoop - they couldn't stay in when I tried!

My personal favourite - I was looking for a flesh-tone bra. She finds one that is only 1 size small, for a change; in fire-engine red.  She tells me that the best part is that you can wear it under light or dark and it won't show through.  Really???

In the past I wouldn't have known to reject all of those things; as it was I was so flustered I just left.

I send my order back to Figleaves way, way outside their period of ""outside UK"" of 34 days from when they send it to when they should recieve it.

But my money is not lost! I went online and found their costumer service chat, asked if there was something one could do (hoping that, if I told them that I wouldn't be able to make it within the 34 days, they would be lenient).

The costumer service agent told me that I wouldn't get a refund, but instead, the amount will be credited to my account to be used on future purchases.

For me, this was equally as good, as I only send it back because the size was wrong - so I was still planning to get other/same bras.
(In the meantime, their sale has ended though, and some bras have sold out, but that could have happened anywhere.)

I later contacted the costumer service to inquire if I should do anything to make sure I would get that amount credited, like, write something on the return form, but she said that I shouldn't do anything as ""a note has already been made on the account"".

I don't know is this means you have to contact them in advance, but it can never hurt, and their chat costumer service is open everyday anyway.

Today I recieved my email that they had recived my return, and it said **""If your return has been received outside our returns period (date of receipt being the date of this email) we may issue a gift card instead of a refund. This can be spent on anything at www.figleaves.com/uk""**

So if someone is worrying about shopping online and about returns and all that - or, if they like me, are just lazy and procrastinating - this might help ease that worry.

Edit: Just wanted to add, this morning I got my email with my gift card number, and the expiry date: 2nd of March **2014**. I think that is enough time, barely. Overall, I'm pretty happy with Figleaves costumer service.

She said I would have to go online ""because no one sells that size"". 

Then... then she asked if it was a gift for someone. I said it was for me, and I got the worst up and down from her, and then she repeated the size to me and asked if she had misheard me.

I'm a total Bra Idiot. I just want to make sure I'm getting the right support. 

Here are my main questions:

What do the numbers mean, Mason? Like, is 34 the size of the boob-cup, or is it the band? What does B, D, H, J, etc mean?

In the bra fitting guide, it says to 'sweep the breast tissue' What is this? Is that armpit boob thing actually breast tissue? 

When I wear my bras right now, and I sit down, the top of the bra kind of pushes out and isn't flush with my boobs. This is bad, or normal?

Where do I buy bras? Right now, my mom takes me to target, but the bras are kind of cheap, at least the ones I get. We went to a Nova or Nora bra shop once, but that was years ago. Also, don't know if this is the right subreddit, but how do I bring up wanting to shop at Victoria's Secret thing? I don't own a single thong, and I'd like one. It's not because anyone is gonna see that stuff, I just want to for me, and no panty lines, that sort of thing. And I want to TRY it, you know?

I haven't bought bras in at least a year. Should I be replacing these things often? I don't even know if my boobs grow. They sure as hell look the same. 

When I raise my arms, the bottom of my bra-cups, the wiry part, raises up too, like off my boob. Is this normal? Other times, when I'm sitting down, it feels too tight, and I have to wiggle it. 

What is a gore, and what does it mean when it tacks? It sounds like something out of some psycho-slasher film. *I'm going to tack your gore.*

Sometimes, my nipple-area peaks out of the top of the bra, that means it's too big, right? Or small?

While on the shows website I saw they had a free preview. 

Overall, I thought the show was pretty...annoying. I get why these shop owners were chosen-they're kinda like  grown up Honey Boo Boo's. They aren't shown doing any real measurements and it's not explained to any of the customers why their current bras don't fit. Obviously these women run a successful lingerie business, so they can't be nearly as dumb as they're portrayed. 

One of my biggest problems with the show was their intern. She's a petite big boobed girl that is supposed to be the ""bimbo"" of the show. She was helping a customer with a similar body type and made a comment along the lines of, ""i just love helping women like you, its like dressing up a barbie doll! I believe everyone has the right to wear lingerie but sometimes its just like ewww gross!!."" 

Pretty insensitive if you ask me. I have a feeling that the show is going to be more for men who wanna see hot chicks try on sexy lingerie and people who wanna laugh at the store owners ridiculousness.

Alas... No longer excited when I opened the package. This must be the most poorly constructed bikini of all time! The sizing in the cups seems totally arbitrary(and really, there is no label designating them as 28FF cups, just a teeny label that says ""28""). There is a good 3"" in the 'center gore' between the cups, and the cups literally end on my back due to how the band is constructed. The 'band' is about 2.5"" on either side of the cups that stretches very little to attach in the back. It seems like they took a larger size bikini/bra/whatever and just cut the band until it stretched to 28"" without really taking into account how this changed the whole construction of the garment.

Unfortunately, it was a sale item so no returns, and I can't figure out how to lengthen the band and take in the center gore. I can kind of manipulate the front to fit properly, but then the band is about 6"" from being able to join in the back. I was considering just sewing black bathing suit material to fill in that 6"", but this seems like a rather messy way to save a very terrible garment. If it looks terrible with alterations, I'll just want to wear a shirt over it... and in that case, I have plenty of bikini tops or one piece bathing suits that technically work but I'd wear a shirt over just to prevent ""accidents"" because they aren't supportive enough to wrangle the boobs in.

Just needed to rant. It's annoying to spend like $25-30 on something that is basically useless(I mean, I guess the bottoms fit, but $30 for swim bottoms?!?!). I don't even think this is functional enough to sell on bratabase or /r/braswap or anything!

But in good news, my panache amira bra arrived, it fits perfectly, and it is soooooo lovely! So I guess I can just tell myself I spent ~$55 on the amira bra, as I paid $25 for it including shipping.

My bra size not something I flaunt or talk about often, but I have bras in the completely wrong size and cannot seem to talk my mother into believing I'm not a 34B like she thinks I am, but I actually fit into a 32D. While out shopping with friends, I had myself measured - through my shirt and current bra - and was told I was a 32D, confirming the measurement I did myself. The associate was actually surprised how I simply nodded my agreement rather than freaking out about how D's are usually associated to larger breasts.
 Afterwards, I was given a little measurement card listing my size and bras that I had tried on that fit, and my mom still did not believe my size, saying that ""it's simply too big and not possible for me."" She switches between rejecting the idea to opening her mind often and I'm not sure if I want to bring it up again. I don't want to sound like a brat, and I wouldn't be as distressed over this if my bras were not causing me so much breast pain and if I didn't have breast tissue migrating. My breasts also sometimes slip around in my bras, and occasionally the band will just unhook itself so that's a very bad moment when just sitting in the middle of class.
 As if an ill-fitting bra did not harm my self-image enough while seeing how strange it looks under clothes; the friends that I was shopping with called me stupid and wrong for thinking of myself as a 32D, even when I had myself professionally measured. All but a few of my friends are very much in the large-breasts category and I am teased often about my size and how they consider themselves ""more attractive due to bra size."" All the teasing from friends I trust is really harming my self confidence and when I ask them to please stop, and that it's really piling up and eventually I mentioned how often they do it and got mad at me for not being a ""good sport."" I'm used to friendly teasing and often don't mind but it's starting to hurt.
 So all in all, I really would love to help open my mother's mind to how bra sizes work and hope my friends stop their teasing soon once they see that I fit nicely into a 32D. It's not something I want to flaunt for any reason, or shove in their face, but I would just like to stop being picked on for being smaller than them.

Obviously I was spilling out of the sides and the top of the cup was cutting across my upper breast tissue. So she thought it had to be a style problem, and brought me a plunge bra. Same issue. Tried a few more styles, same issue.

Finally, I told her my measurements and that I saw on their website that they add a cup size for each additional inch on the bust measurement (I was kind of trying to play dumb and act innocent, since I didn't want it to turn into a confrontation. Also, I don't know everything about bras, so I thought I'd just take her advice and see how it went.) So she said she'd measure me. I was still wearing a 38C at this point, which was obviously smashing a lot of my tissue in. ""With a bra on?"" I asked, and she said that's how they do it. ok......So she got 37 under bust, and then she measured above and pulled it kind of tight and said ""See, 41! So you're a 38C!"" Sigh.

So then after a few more of that size didn't work, she brought some 38DD bras. Those fit better, but I was still spilling out of the sides. She was very perplexed at this point. She thought the 38DD looked good, but I pointed out my armpit fat was spilling out, and it was still cutting me across the top of my chest. Also, the band was riding up. I mentioned that, and she said that's how it's supposed to fit! 

The last one she brought was a back-smoothing style. It fit the best, but it was really loose in the band, and she even agreed. So I didn't buy anything. The lady was nice and she meant well, and it wasn't a horrible experience, but I just felt like a crazy person. I mean, if you're spilling out of a bra, why not go up a cup size, even if you couldn't possibly imagine being a bigger size? As I was leaving, she told me some other stores to try, but to stay away from F and G sizes, and that I should stay with DD.

I know I'm at the bottom end of their sizes, and since I've lost weight I really should be in a 36 (I tried some later at Dillard's, and confirmed this.) I'm sure she's used to seeing much larger band sizes, where a C and D is much larger than a 38C or D. So I guess I can understand why she was so confused. But shouldn't she know more about bras?

Since then I have started my own blog where I feature bra metamorphosis -- because I know they can be really  motivating. I was wondering whether any of you ladies might be interested in contributing?

 Basically I am looking for chin-to-waist shots in a bra in the old size and in a bra in the correct size (you can wear a top over that if you like, and you can also show your face if you wish to).

I went back yesterday and got to exhange the bras and i had a different person fit me this time. 

They fit me again in 2 chantelle bras, but this time a 34E, they fit perfectly! 

Thanks to everyone who gave me advice in the last post, it made my wallet happy and my boobs happier to pay for something that actually fits me well. ",,False,,t5_2s8kf,False,,,True,t3_13rp87,http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/13rp87/thank_you_update_a_fitting_problem_after_i_got/,
