1355844118.0,274,self.productivity,151ylo,How I solved MY procrastination,PTKIRL,308,34,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/151ylo/how_i_solved_my_procrastination/,"I cant speak to anyone else, and i won't assume to understand anyone else to tell them what to do. All i can do i share my own experience...

Procrastination was my life. In all the ways you know it, i did it. Couple that with what was medically described as ""A pretty decent dose of ADHD"" from my doctors. So yeah, as you can imagine, my life hasnt been really great on that front. The only way i would ever get anything done is by terrifying myself into thinking my life would be over if i didnt get that report in, or call that person, or whatever day to day things you have to do. It worked well enough to keep my afloat, but my ""quality of life"" was complete shit.

My procrastination got bad to the point where my boss was commenting on it. This was completely unacceptable. My family's work ethic is beyond everything else, and so is mine. Work came first, and procrastination was not going to be the end of me, i wouldnt let it. So i seeked medical help.

Through the sessions i had realized a very important tendency i had. Whenever i looked at my to do list, it would usually have quite a few things on it, my mind would look at the entirety as a singular object. The immensity and impossibility of completing that singular object was overwhelming, to the point i didnt even want to think about it.

So i didnt. I would go on reddit, i would watch youtube videos, watch movies, and everytime i would glance over at my to-do list, my self loathing would grow bigger and bigger. I would occupy my time with whatever i could so that i had some kind of excuse for not getting things done. I did this subconsciously. I didnt even know i was doing it until it was pointed out.

Once i realized i was evaluating the ENTIRETY of my tasks as a single task, i decided to ignore everything on the list except the top priority. I literally said to myself, ""This one thing is the only thing i have to do today"". Lo and behold, and hour later that task is complete. And then i said to myself ""well shit, why didnt i do that earlier?, ok fine, the next thing is all i have to worry about.""

Rinse and repeat and before i knew it, my task lists were regularly getting done. My quailty of life has skyrocketed (mainly because productivity=happiness for me). 

As time went on, I started to smooth out this new tool. I dont use a ""to-do"" list anymore, i use my outlook calendar (same can be done with google/ical). If i need something done, i schedule it into the calendar. Everything is prioritized based on urgency. Sometimes i inaccurately estimate the time i need for a task, pfft, whatever, work until its done, or schedule it later for the day. At least now i have the experience for similar future items.

Then i thought to myself, shit...I am a slave to my calendar. At first that REALLY bothered me. But thats when you remember, UH DUR - YOU CREATED YOUR CALENDAR. So in reality, you are a slave to a more objective self, which i needed in the first place; to listen to the ""you need to do that report, not check reddit"".

Every single day i have an entry at 9am which says ""schedule your day"". I have 10 minutes allocated to it (it usually takes me 2). That brings me to my next point.

Overestimate needed completion time. ESPECIALLY if you are just starting out. Does sending an email take 30 seconds? schedule 5-10 minutes. Now you dont feel like you are rushing, you can feel comfortable, and most importantly, you dont start to hate this calendar. the calendar is nice to you, its understanding, its loving, but at the same time, it expects certain a certain level of productivity.

Caveat: you may feel ""i have no idea how #5 of my to-do list will take"" - THATS OK. Thats the type of experience that comes with time. One of my tricks is to think of every task as a science experiment, that the ""data"" i'm trying to collect is

* How good quality can i make this?
* How long will it take (dont rush, you need the objective data)


There are other things that go into it, but that epiphany of putting on proverbial horse blinders and only focusing on ONE thing, while completely IGNORING the rest, was what really started the ""holy shit, holy shit, holy shit, my stuff is getting done""


So stop living vicariously through the successes of everyone else, and start the path that allows YOU to become the person OTHER people live through. **Stop consuming; Start Producing.**

PS. I still procrastinate every once in a while, i dont think that will ever go away, but at least i've learned to catch myself. I know that i will get the important things done way ahead of when they should. That kind of confidence can not be harvested from anywhere, it must be grown within.

1333490660.0,147,self.productivity,rrujz,How to learn a new language efficiently (and quickly),gwyner,166,19,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/rrujz/how_to_learn_a_new_language_efficiently_and/,"I needed to learn to speak 3-4 languages over the past few years for my job, and in the process have landed on a pretty damn good method.  It got me to C1 fluency in French in about 5 months, and I'm currently using it with Russian (and plan on reaching C1 equivalent fluency by September).  At this point, I go in 4 stages:





* Stage 1: Learn the correct pronunciation of the language.  Doing this does a few things –  because I’m first and foremost learning how to hear that language’s sounds, my listening comprehension gets an immediate boost before I even start traditional language age learning.  Once I start vocabulary training, I retain it better because I’m familiar with how words should sound and how they should be spelled.  (Correct spellings in French, for example, are much easier to remember when there’s a connection between the spelling and the sound), and once I finally start speaking to native speakers, they don't switch to English for me or dumb down their language, which is awesome sauce.  If you're learning a language with a different alphabet, this is where you learn the phonetic alphabet(s) (Kana, for Japanese or Pinyin for Chinese, for example)

 



* Stage 2: Vocabulary and grammar acquisition (itself in a few stages), no English allowed.
I start with a frequency list and mark off any words I can portray with pictures alone (basic nouns and verbs).  I put those in an [Anki deck](http://www.towerofbabelfish.com/Tower_of_Babelfish/Anki.html) and learn them.  Once I have some words to play with, I start putting them together.  I use Google translate (Exception to no English rule - just be careful there's no English in your Anki deck) and a grammar book to start making sentences, then get everything double-checked at lang-8.com before putting them into my Anki deck.  Turning them into fill-in-the-blank flashcards builds the initial grammar and connecting words.  As vocab and grammar grow, I eventually move to monolingual dictionaries and writing my own definitions for more abstract words (again doublechecked at lang-8.com).  This builds on itself; the more vocab and grammar you get, the more vocab and grammar concepts you can describe in the target language.  Eventually you can cover all the words in a 2000 word frequency list as a foundation and add any specific vocab you need for your own interests.





* Stage 3: Listening, writing and reading work
Once I have a decent vocabulary and familiarity with grammar, I start writing essays, watching TV shows and reading books, and talking (mostly to myself) about the stuff I see and do.  Every writing correction gets added to the Anki deck, which continues to build my vocab and grammar.





* Stage 4: Speech
At the point where I can more or less talk (haltingly, but without too many grammar or vocab holes) and write about most familiar things, I find some place to immerse in the language and speak all the time (literally.  No English allowed or else you won't learn the skill you're trying to learn, which is adapting to holes in your grammar or vocabulary by going around them rapidly and automatically without having to think about it).  I prefer Middlebury college, but a few weeks in the target country will work as well if you're very vigorous with sticking to the target language and not switching to English.  If you're extremely strict with yourself, your brain adapts pretty quickly and learns how to put all the info you learned in stages 1-3 together quickly enough to turn into fluent speech.

 



I've written a (not yet available) book on the topic and a (now available) website, [Tower of Babelfish.com](http://www.towerofbabelfish.com).  You can find some language-specific resources at the [Languages page](http://www.towerofbabelfish.com/Tower_of_Babelfish/Languages.html), some more [detailed discussions](http://www.towerofbabelfish.com/Tower_of_Babelfish/The_Method.html) about this stuff, and some [video tutorials about pronunciation](http://www.towerofbabelfish.com/Tower_of_Babelfish/Videos.html)",,False,,t5_2qh1k,False,,,True,t3_rrujz,http://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/rrujz/how_to_learn_a_new_language_efficiently_and/,

A bit about me, I'm 27 years old, male, and a natural procrastinator. For the past 9 months or so I have been operating at a much higher level than average and much higher than most of my peers. How do I do it? Three ways:

* New habits
* Core motivation
* Accountability

Right now I have a full time job, I go to school, I'm building two new websites, I'm learning to play the Viola, and up until last month when I broke my nose and had severe complications I was training MMA a couple times a week. I still work out now, but I do things that are less violent until my cartilage fully heals ;) 

So how does someone who naturally wants to put things off do so much? By creating *new habits*



**New Habits**
I didn't start off doing all of that at once, I slowly added. One thing I did do is go to work every day, that has been a habit of mine ever since I was 16, so in a sense I had a head start. I know some people don't have jobs, but that doesn't mean you can get into a habit of working and improving every day. The great thing about having a job is they MAKE you come in. If you don't come in, then you don't get paid. If you don't get paid, you don't have the money to live. This makes it a great motivation for me and speaks to one of the other principals, *accountability*.

So here I am working 40 hours a week and I decide I want to go to school (why I want to go is from the *core motivation* principal we will get to later). Another great thing about school is they also hold you accountable, just like work, except with school you are paying THEM! You best be going to all your classes and doing all your work so you are getting your moneys worth. Once you go for a few weeks this becomes a habit. It becomes 'easy' to work 40 hours a week and go to school, at least in the sense that its automatic.

It has been my experience that if I'm only working 40 hours a week I am general lazy when I get off work. I drink scotch, watch netflix, and in general piss away my time. *If I am working 40 hours a week and I have another obligation that takes a significant amount of time (between 10-20 hours a week) then it has a tendency to push me over the edge and make even my 'relaxing' time become productive.* I think this is the most important discovery about myself I have made in the last year. 



**Core Motivation**

This require a bit of soul searching and when it comes to that I can't really help too much. I consider myself lucky that I have figured out exactly what I want to do with my life, most of my peers have not. One thing that contributed to that epiphany was figuring out what really drives me. Was it money? Power? Creativity? Laziness? Love? Sex?

None of the above for me. My core motivation is ""Helping people"" as cliche as that sounds. There are a few caveats for me, I want to be able to help people, be creative, make decent income, and have control of my own schedule. Those 'accessories' helped narrow down my career choices. If I really just wanted to help people I could go volunteer at some non-profit making pennies, but I would rather not.

*Figuring out my core motivation has given me strength and drive when I need to start a new habit (like going to school), or if I run into problems or setbacks during the course of executing my plans.* I really make an effort to visual the life I want, and the life I am creating, and I know that someday (soon) I will have that life. 



**Accountability**

Like I said, I am a natural procrastinator. One thing I do have going for me though is 'honor'. I am an honorable bastard and I hate being shamed. I use this to my advantage and I have surrounded myself with people that hold me accountable for my actions. Some of these are mentors, friends, parents, consultants and teachers. Some days I really don't want to practice my Viola, but I know that I have a lesson on Friday so I better practice otherwise it will be embarrassing for me to fumble through a song while my teacher stands by and listens. If I get bad grades at school then I will be letting down the people that have granted me a partial scholarship to take these classes. If I don't accomplish the goals I set forth for my website then my business consultant will be asking me hard questions and I won't have the answers...

Some people suggest you tell your goals to the whole world, I see people posting on reddit as a way to keep themselves accountable. This never really made sense to me. People on the internet don't look me in the eye when I tell them I failed, but my teachers/mentors/friends do. I have found it much more effective to have real life contacts than anything online. 



**Conclusion**

The reason I'm posting this is not to brag and not to say ""Oh look how productive I am."" I do think that we should be studying people that are actively achieving and figuring out what they are doing right. It's similar to the idea in psychology of studying how healthy people are that way rather than studying sick people and figuring out how to make them healthy. Pick a model that is working, and then form yourself to that. It makes things soooooooooo much easier. 

You will notice that in this whole post I didn't include anything about to-do lists, productivity apps, or mind 'hacks' that help me increase my effectiveness. My method of doing things changes and flows depending on my life, and I think concerning yourself with the minutia like that just bogs you down and makes you feel productive when you really are just being 'busy'.

I was not happy with my productivity at work. I knew I was not being as productive as I could be and eventually it would catch up with me with negative      consequences. One thing that I started doing is working in 30 minute blocks and then taking a 5 minute break in between. During those 30 minutes I set a     timer and if at anytime I do something other then work (ie. go to the bathroom) I pause the timer. I keep track of how many blocks I do each day and record  the total in a Google spreadsheet at the end of the day. When I first started doing this I could not believe the amount of time I was only doing strictly    work related stuff. As a result of doing this I have since double my work productivity. It has worked so well for me my wife and I have started having our   son use this technique, who is in 7th grade and doing school online from home, because he was getting behind in his schooling and he would probably be       labeled as an ultimate procrastinator. I use the Chrome app [Timer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hepmlgghomccjinhcnkkikjpgkjibglj) to keep      track of my time while my son uses an egg timer. He has since been able to get caught up with his schoolwork using this technique. If this technique sounds  familiar, it is very similar to the [Pomodoro Technique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique), which is what I started out with but customized   to fit my needs.",,False,,t5_2qh1k,False,,,True,t3_10dvqh,http://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/10dvqh/my_single_most_useful_tip_to_increase_productivity/,

- When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,
- I all alone beweep my outcast state
- And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries
- And look upon myself and curse my fate,
- Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,
- Featured like him, like him with friends possess'd,
- Desiring this man's art and that man's scope,
- With what I most enjoy contented least;
- Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,
- Haply I think on thee, and then my state,
- Like to the lark at break of day arising
- From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate;
- For thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings
- That then I scorn to change my state with kings.

The Classic Poems post writer looks at the piece as evidence that even a world-historic writer of Shakespeare's stature could sometimes get depressed about his writing, to say nothing of the other miserable states of affairs in his life: he was likely in massive debt, his plays doubtless made him enemies in the theatre, and so on. I took something slightly different from this revisitation, though: as a person (and a writer) who's struggled with feelings of inadequacy and burnout--""with what I most enjoy contented least""--I was most interested in seeing how old Bill got *out* of his darkened state. Predictably, it's love; this is a sonnet, after all. Here's where it gets interesting: there's considerable academic debate [to this day](http://shakespeare-online.com/sonnets/sonnetsautobio.html) about whether Shakes was writing the sonnets as autobiographical outpourings of his deepest heart, or if they're just creative exercises and attempts to master the sonnet form. Let's take a side in that discussion and imagine that this *is* a creative exercise--what's Bill saying to us about how he escapes burnout?

&gt;*Haply I think on thee, and then my state,
...sings hymns at heaven's gate;
For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings
That then I scorn to change my state with kings.*

What's he done? He's stopped and **thought of something that rewards him**, that repays his love with a sense of fulfillment. He's remembered that he has a thing he loves to do that makes him feel complete. It's not hard for me to imagine that he could be talking about *the act of writing itself, the work he does every day*. His path out of burnout is choosing to remember why he loves what he loves, and reminding himself that the effort of his love is rewarded with a sense of satisfaction. Once he's done that, h may as well ""scorn to change [his] state with kings,"" because there are few better feelings in the world than loving and being loved in return--whether your love is a person, or work that means something to you. There's lots of reason in his work to believe that Shakes' knew that, and maybe he was trying to pass some of that on to us here.

I'm a 21 year old guy, finishing up my 4th year of University. I'm taking a super heavy course load, working 15-20 hours a week at my job, in addition to sitting on a crazy amount of committees and such across the university, volunteering and trying to stay fit. My issue is that I've become so ridiculously over extended that I'm having a lot of trouble just keeping track of everything and working productively and consistently. I've tried writing things down, a million different apps and tricks but nothing I've done so far seems to really do it. I end up just having a million things to do at once and stressing myself out to no end.

Does anyone have any tips on to keep track of everything well enough, prioritize and make the most of my time?

Upon graduating high school in '10, I've bounced between two different degrees, due to a potent cocktail of indecisiveness, mild anxiety and depression, coasting through high school and general laziness.
I've currently landed on Computer Science as the degree I'd like to complete - I have aspirations to one day work for Google in some capacity.

However, I just *can't* bring myself to work. 

Every single night, I meticulously plan out my day, blocking out times for activities I want to do, and setting goals for the day, week, month and year.
And every single day, I completely throw those plans out the window. I wake up, think to myself ""Argh, it's already 11, not gonna get anything done, fuck this"", and waste the day watching repeat episodes of TV shows I've already seen, listening to podcasts I've already heard, eating badly and watching porn.
I can't seem to pull myself out of this rut.

I think I'm afraid of failure: I've already wasted so much of my time - my friends are all graduating university already and getting full time jobs, while I'm back at square one.
And what if I suck at coding? What if I suck at this thing that I like a lot, that has a flourishing job market and earning potential, and I have to start this whole fucking thing again?

I don't know what to do anymore. I've tried *so* many different methods of productivity - Getting Things Done, Pomodoro Technique, Seinfeld's Productivity Secret - and each of those has failed me (or I've failed them).

I taught Advanced Excel courses at Google and saw just how transformative a robust set of data can become when someone is given the skills to manipulate and analyze that data with only their imagination holding them back.
  
Pivot Tables are absolutely incredible at data analysis, but I saw over and over again, even in the heart of Silicon Valley, that everyone was either too intimidated by their complexities, or too unfamiliar with their intricacies to use Pivot Tables effectively.  And dammit, I want people changing the world while I'm still in it!

I, like a lot of people, have problems with feeling overwhelmed when faced with a massive todo list. My brain seems to clump all the tasks into one beast, despite them being separately listed.

I have an idea to attempt to conquer this. I'm not sure if it has been done before, nor am i sure if it will work (only thought of the idea today). My idea is the ""Todo Pipe"". It attempts to quell the feeling of being overwhelmed by limiting what you can see of your todo list.

I imagined the idea in the form of a software platform (it would be harder to manage w/ pen and paper, though it is possible). It would be a calendar type program, maybe seeing a week in advance. Like all todo list programs/calendars you could enter a task, give it a priority, due date, etc. Now the idea is it will only show the TOP TASK for each day. When a task is added, it goes to the bottom of the list. When the top task is completed, the next task is shown. A counter for how many tasks for each day might be shown to give some idea of how much is needed to be done, but it only shows the one item at a time, so only that item receives your focus. 

Thoughts?

**EDIT:** Seems like the idea has been done before, but this thread has served another purpose. It's given me a bunch of options in terms of programs and web apps that can help me out :).

For some, this may be a no-brainer but I hope others can also relate. 

I want to know how to fully retain information from reading a book that is neither a narrative nor a text book. I am currently reading the famous book ""Getting Things Done"" by David Allen (of course, everyone should read this). The book has so many things that are applicable to lifestyle habits. However, what is the best method of approaching and implementing this information in life? If you simply read the book, I doubt you will retain all the details. If you read it again, you may know more but there may not be structure in integrating the habits into life. For now, I take basic notes and reference pages. I know these types of books aren't the ones where you kick your feet up and blaze through them in a day or two. But, I can imagine how time consuming it'd be to finish the book by taking notes on ALL important details. So what are your ""best"" method for doing this?

- Improved nutrition culminating in week-long elimination diet last week.

Back to ""clean"" today with goal of doing incremental re-introduction afterwards to identify problem foods.

(Scroll down for TL;DR)

Hi, not a throwaway, just starting a new account; I'm a long time subscriber to r/productivity. A lot of my problem is tied, I think, to being out of practice with dealing with spontaneity regarding work. I work freelance, and haven't worked much the past couple years due to medical issues. Those are now being controlled, and I'm trying to get back into the ""rhythm"" of work. 

Thing is, around the time I stopped working so much, I had also shifted from a client-based freelance model to a self-promotion based one. As such, I now have no work responsibilities to anyone but myself (and my bills). It's become really difficult to re-impose internal deadlines — externally-based deadlines are so much more motivating. I have trouble making my self-imposed deadlines feel urgent to me.

I've started to work on that by identifying best working times for me (morning morning morning) and setting schedules that manage time around appointments and other personal commitments. However, I'm finding that last-minute (same day is an example) changes to my schedules *wreck the rest of my day.* They completely discombobulate my mind. 

I've defined this, whether it's true/real or no, as a lack of mental ""agility,"" or I guess ability to deal with spontaneity. Not having an armload of responsibilities actually compounds this, as the adage, ""If you want to get something done, give it to a busy person"" is true for me. I am not often busy, so another issue I'm working on getting a handle on is motivation without busyness. I think I might be trying to deal with that by simply becoming busier (it really does help me get more done), which may be part of why something being cancelled throws me for a loop — I already planned my day before and after this event, and now I have this big time gap I wasn't prepared for.

**TL;DR below!**

As it is now, when a wrench is thrown into my day, I throw my hands in the air and just can't get back into the swing of things. There's also the constant stress of needing to make more money again, bills, expenses. When I get that under control enough to be prepared to concentrate on a productive work schedule, and something with the scheduling changes, my mind feels heavy and overloaded, sluggish — it can't concentrate on anything long enough and deep enough to formulate a new plan.

Does any of this sound familiar to you? Does anyone else experience it? How do you deal with it?

Do you have any tips for improving my ability to deal with spontaneity and GBTW? Reading suggestions would be welcomed as well.

1355719665.0,46,self.productivity,14z84m,What's the secret? Extreme procrastination.,,59,13,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/14z84m/whats_the_secret_extreme_procrastination/,"I've been procrastinating these last few years to an extreme level. How extreme you might ask? I don't think it gets any more extreme than this:




Let's say I have a physics test this Friday. I spend all week trying to prep my mind into thinking that I will get into studying mode. I pull all-nighters every single day up until the test. Why? Well, I don't end up doing anything the entire day so I convince myself every single day leading to the test that I will make up for what I didn't study during the day by studying at night. Instead, I pull as many all-nighters as possible leading up to the test while having done literally no studying. I spend the entire week telling myself that I should be studying but instead I find my self masturbating frequently to relieve stress and I constantly browse reddit and play League of Legends for no legit reason. I tell myself: I feel like shit right now, but playing League of Legends makes me feel good and lets me forget about my life, so I'll just play one more game. So I continue to procrastinate by doing stupid stuff like playing videogames and browsing reddit up until about 6 am in the morning. At that point, I have about 4 hours until the test. I start to try to study, but I either give up because of burning out from lack of sleep and eventually with a lack of concentration, I fall asleep. My mother wakes me up 4 hours later and I tell her that I studied nothing and I feel like crap. I tell her to call the school and she lies to them with guilt that I'm sick so I can't attend the test. I continue to sleep until I'm more well rested. I wake up and great, I have an entire extra day to study for that test that everyone else already did. I start to try to study again. Lots of masturbation + videogames + reddit later, and it's midnight and I haven't done shit. It isn't until 6 am that night that I finally get my act together and study.




My entire life I've done work by pulling allnighters. I can't do any work during the day. I've considered suicide.



On the days that I somehow do make it to the test on the same day that everyone else is writing it, I notice this girl that hasn't done any last-minute studying at all the entire day. She probably didn't cram anything at all. She could've probably wrote the test yesterday and would've got a better mark than me if I had an extra month. She smiles at me, ""Ready for the test?"" ""Kinda,"" I reply wondering what her secret is. She has no idea what I would do to be in her position.



Edit: Just to clarify, I'm in high school. And I get very little homework done the weeks before the test by the way. I would've dropped out of high school if it weren't for the extreme amount of pressure I'm getting to stay. Didn't think I would take such a nosedive to rock bottom considering how well I did during middle school and my ninth year (high eighties average).",,False,,t5_2qh1k,1355720847.0,,,True,t3_14z84m,http://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/14z84m/whats_the_secret_extreme_procrastination/,

Certainly, these can be good apps and systems, but they're most useful for people who are already productive. They can help that person become *even more* productive than they actually were. 

If you're wanting to *become* productive (in the first place) then you're in a different space than these people. You have a lot of work ahead of you - developing the self-discipline, routines, habits, even the willpower to become more productive.

Now, I'm not suggesting that something's wrong with /r/productivity, and at 15k users, it's not like we can afford to split it into a beginner subreddit and an advanced subreddit. It is and should be for all people at various productivity levels.

What do people think about having more discussions on productivity? Mybe this subreddit could go text-only posts for a week to ignite discussion? Or a text-only weekend?

Maybe we could form work groups that would help people to be accountable for their productivity habits. Like a support group for beginners?

They are scattered around the world in different countries and all work very hard at their assigned jobs, however I am having trouble bringing them all together ocassionally to get some healthy communication and competitiveness introduced to keep things flowing.

What I believe is happening is that due to how highly skilled they are, personal projects to show off their talents take a high priority, and interacting with others who are just as skilled almost seems like a waste of time, or perhaps even a gateway to a potential ego-bursting they would rather avoid, as they are all highly regarded as gurus within their personal assigned area and perhaps don't want to feel like there is someone out there who could be their equal.

We've got a basic forum where interaction happens sometimes thanks to a few sparky individuals (and constant pushing from me) - however the majority of posts are these people promoting their own work, which never results in much discussion.

I am really motivated to try and get these guys / gals streaming their ideas with each other, sharing resources, having fun and just generally communicating and learning for both their own personal gain, and of course, the image of the company.

Bringing them all together to one place in the world is too far outside of our budget, so I'm looking for some sort of digital online solution and I'm curious if anyone has come across this sort of platform, or has any suggestions for what could be included if one was to be built.

Some sort of online team building CMS or system that can be quite highly customized to suit highly skilled professionals who might have a tendency to shy away from that sort of thing.

A few things I've thought about already:

* Creating an internal pseudo-rank type system where points can be scored for contributing/communicating, that result in company bonuses (we aren't interested in publicly ranking these people).
* Have regular games or challenges that involve them showing off their skills in particular areas, perhaps having the criteria defined by a rotating system each week so each individual gets a turn at being in control
* Teaming them up into smaller groups that balance their skill sets

Anything here is welcome.. if there's anything that's worked for you in the past or my words spring any ideas, I'd love to hear them.

I for one am one of those people who, as it turns out, like to daydream about their hobbies more than actually doing them. I like photography, cooking, programming, playing music, watching movies, biking and playing other sports, gaming and whatnot. However, I've not touched my guitar for months, I rode my bike ONCE in the entire last year, I photograph only when there's an actual ""well this should be documented"" occasion and I rarely ever manage to push myself to do some developing at home. 

If I'm home straight from work I have 5-6 hours before I go to sleep at best. In that time I have to squeeze in cooking and eating something, hanging out with my family at least a little bit, and lately there's more and more work to be done. On a different day I'll hang out after work, where I'll have no more than maybe 2-3 hours of time before going to bed.

Is there a program that you can put a time limit per day on a site and the only way to change it is to change the block and it will change it after 24h has passed.

If you got any other ideas, maybe own experience then please share i appreciate it!

I always kinda thought I could just use my iPhone for that but it has proven to not be very effective since most of the time I'm too lazy to type it out. I feel a little notebook would be very useful just to jot down small reminders, such as ""pick up milk"" on the way home, or to write down someone's name that I just met. 

For those who have it, how do you use it to its maximum efficiency? For example, do you use only one page a day or just keep writing until the page is full? How often do you check it? What kind of paper does your notebook have? I'm deciding between blank white paper, lined paper, and graph, which each have their own advantages and disadvantages.

Not that the brand matters, but I like the Moleskine one, something like this http://www.amazon.com/Moleskine-Plain-Notebook-Pocket-Classic/dp/8883701038/ref=sr_1_9?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1370401239&amp;sr=8-9&amp;keywords=moleskine",,False,,t5_2qh1k,False,,,True,t3_1fp4fa,http://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1fp4fa/using_a_pocketsized_notebook_throughout_the_day/,

This is, of course, in addition to the separate system in place for managerial approval and receipt filing. It serves no purpose in my work, has no monetary benefit for the company or customers, and is, imo, a waste of time. And it's exactly the kind of thing that I will put off until my boss gets a tattling e-mail from the accounting department and tells me to do it. 

This is my problem: my to-do list has become a parking lot for all my tasks that are uninteresting and inconsequential. While this isn't that big a deal, I find it spills up the scale of importance -- first I let stuff slide that doesn't matter, then I let stuff slide that doesn't matter *much*, until I'm procrastinating on all but the most interesting stuff.  It's like deciding one day to stop making your bed because you can spend the time doing something more in line with your goals, and it's just going to get messed up in a few hours anyway. Then you decide to stop putting your dirty clothes in the hamper because you can just pick them all up on laundry day, and all of a sudden you're sleeping on a pile of empty drink cups and pizza boxes, wrapped in a towel because there's no clean underwear. 

But more so than just not being interested in it, I'm actually irritated about having to check those boxes, to remember yet another login, to have another bookmark. I find I really have to spend a lot of mental energy to drag myself to do these kinds of things, it's like talking myself into doing another 3 reps or another quarter mile at the gym. I'm actually mentally tired after I do them, as if I've done hard work.

I envision the former as a record of daily work, a log of all work to date and a record of meetings and interactions at work. The latter would be more personal, and act as both a second brain (storage wise) and a way to organise my daily life. I'm also considering a weekly journal. 

**TL:DR - Please help me find a good GTD-style system using notebooks so that I don't screw up this rare opportunity.**

But sometimes I catch myself in situations where I have to do something I absolutely dislike and end up postponing it a few hours, Example from this morning:

Got up at 7am because I had to do cold calls. I absolutely dislike (almost fear) doing cold calls, but it is necessary for our business development. Planned to drink some coffee and read news, start at 7.30. While I was awake at 7, I somehow ""decided"" that it is no problem if I do it at 8. At 8 I took another coffee, 8.30 is fine. Then at 8.30 I started, and now at 9.30 I'm basically finished. 

If I look back at the hour, the whole process would have maybe taken be 20 minutes to finish. But instead of being finished at 7.50am I am finished at 9.30am.

The thing is not only they I don't like doing the task (I don't like studying either, nevertheless I do not have problem to study), just that I really somehow fear doing cold calls because I am not good at it and I often know that the outcome will be zero. But it is part of my job.

And I do not completely abandon my task, it's just that I wait those few minutes. Most likely I could have told you this morning that it will only take 20 minutes, nevertheless I waited and waited, for what?

We're basically an internal ad agency for approximately 200 real estate agents. 

My department (made up of a director, a copywriter, a graphic designer, a print associate, photographer and myself, a web developer) is incredibly efficient when it comes to internal interactions. Over the years we've streamlined many of our programs.

But there are always inefficiencies when it comes to interfacing with the company as a whole, whom we produce marketing collateral for. People who consistently refuse to contact the appropriate person, do not use the proper channels, do not provide details, are bad at communication as a whole, etc. 

We've tried a number of methods to reinforce efficient procedures when it comes to our workflow, but the process is often choked up by inefficient individuals. A lot of our situations read straight out of Clients from Hell.

All through college, I refused to keep any sort of paper planner, relying instead on a parade of different productivity apps and one-off scheduling programs that just ended up collecting dust on my hard drive. 

The semester before I graduated, I had a class with another premed student. He would spend the first half hour of class with a blank piece of computer paper, writing down everything he had to do for the day and any random notes he thought of. He swore by that paper, and after I once again abandoned my newest digital assistant (Evernote, I believe) I gave it a try myself. 

The effect of having a tangible written list of things to do was hard to believe. Paper doesn't run out of batteries, it doesn't have a sleep-preventing glowing screen, it doesn't take multiple clicks to get to, and most importantly, *it can't play Angry Birds or surf the internet.* 

Finally, we get to the real question: I've just been writing to-do lists on blank legal pads, but I want something cleaner and inclusive while still being relatively small. For those of you who still keep track of things on paper, what's your system look like? What do you trust a computer to handle, and what do you always feel better writing down yourself?

I decided to do something about mine. So from my own portfolio of problems, I picked the two areas where change was needed the most.

Fourteen months ago I picked the first one: new job.

The old job was fine, but it was low paying, part time and late shifts only. The new job? Affiliate marketing. 

Since then I have made about $400 in total, but more importantly I know how I made those $400. By going through the process that gave me the first $400 one more time, I would get another $400.

The problem? I'm not doing it. I just talk about doing it.  

The second problem I decided to change was around last summer (though its been on my mind far longer). I need to improve my overall energy levels. Change what I eat and more exercise.

And just like with my work, I have picked out what I'm going to eat and what exercise I'm going to begin with. But I don't do it. I just talk about doing it over my hamburger and cola.

I have read books about habits and how you can change anything, but here too I just end up talking about it.

I need help! I don't understand why I'm not doing what I want to do.

How can I use all this knowledge I've built up? Because I'm slowly going insane here.

Possibly relevant information:
- Seeing a therapist. 45min/biweekly only does so much.
- Taking a SSRI.
- Nothing really exites me anymore.
- There is nothing I look forward to doing in the future.

p.s.: Please ask if you need more information. I spent way to long drafting this, so something may have gotten lost along the way.

Sorry if my question really has no answer besides trial and error, but if anyone can give me any tips or a nudge in the right direction, I'm really excited to start getting more out of my time because I have high hopes for what I'm able to accomplish if I can just organize myself better and put myself in a position to be productive.

It basically outlines my plan for beating my procrastination habit over the next 6 weeks. This post will outline the progress of the past week.

**Day 1 - 19-02-2013**

I got up at 7am in the morning and attended my first class at 9. My main goal of this day was to work at some of the exercises for a programming assignment I have due in next week, I didn't set myself a very specific goal and ended up just spinning my wheels, I did put a bit of a dent in the the assignment but not much. Lesson learnt set specific and achievable tasks. I completed a total of 6 20 minute pomodoro's today and I did take time off in the evening.

**Day 2 - 20-02-2013**

This day was much more successful, I got up at 7 am, I planned to start work at 8 am but I had a bit of resistance. I delayed for 30 minutes before setting myself a small initial Goal to get started on the programming assignment. It worked brilliantly, I got all the exercise's done for the third part of the assignment. I started fixing an iPhone at 5pm and ended up finishing at 8pm, as a result I didn't get to relax much that evening. Lesson learnt stop work at 6 you will like yourself more for it. I did a total of 7 pormodoro's today although it would have been more, but I didn't use them when Fixing the iphone.

**Day 3 - 21-02-2013**

I didn't get up to 10 and had a dentist appointment at 11:15 which gave me no time for work in the morning, I completed 8 exercises for the programming assignment and fixed another iPhone in the afternoon with no resistance. I completed a total of 8 pormodoro's and took the evening off as planned.

**Day 4 - 22-02-2013**

I got up at 10 again today which made the morning quite unproductive, I fixed a blackberry screen and completed the final exercise for my programming assignment. I had planned on making interfaces for a android app in eclipse but delayed and procrastinated a little bit. The reason was because I have never done this before and felt fear of not being successful. This has been noted and I will use mental contrasting the next time I am in this situation. I completed 6 pormodoros today and took time off in the evening.

**Day 5 - 23-02 - 2013**

I did not get up till 1pm today as I was up to really late the night before. With the limited time I had in the afternoon I fixed an iphone, Did my laundry and went to a friends house and fixed their printer. I got a total of 5 pormodoros done and took time off in the evening.

**Conclusion:**

I have had a successful first week, I got the most important tasks I wanted to have done and have an assignment almost complete a week before the deadline for the first time in years. I have a few issues that need addressing such as handling resistance to tasks that I don't know what to do to start and my sleeping habits need to be sorted out, and that's what I will focus on this coming week. For this next week I will increase the pomodoros to 25 minutes.",,False,,t5_2qh1k,False,,,True,t3_197l8t,http://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/197l8t/beating_procrastination_progress_report_for_week_1/,

I'm sure they are not the only virtual sticky notes out there but they are, for me, the best.

I found WorkFlowy via /r/productivity last month and I loved it but... it didn't stick (sorry for pun).

All the stuff I should be putting in WorkFlowy I am still putting in Stickies, or if it is really big just a notepad++ document. I also use a GTD version of Evernote for other projects and ideas, mostly to catalog my writing ideas. So WorkFlowy get's no love.

But I was just thinking... MAN if I could have a nested document like WorkFlowy that could fit inside a sticky note that would AWESOME. I mean, even if I could just add 1 level of nesting to my currently flat stickies that would be amazing.

But the possibilities of Stickies + WorkFlowy are endless. If you could have a complete WorkFlowy document with EVERYTHING, and then make little sticky note shards (windows) that are locked to a particular dynamic scope within the larger document (say ""My grocery List"" or ""Project X for client Y and all sub nodes"" or ""All items tagged with 'Next Action'"") that would be AMAZING!

I guess you could unlock the scope to allow you to search around your entire document, but perhaps the sticky could be set to snap back to a particular default view.

Anyone know of anything like that?

I'm a uni student in my final year. And dear god my productivity has been in decline ever since I started uni. Basically, I've been in boarding school most of my life, with strict structures telling you when to eat, when to do your homework etc etc. not doing your work gave you punishments, detentions and whatnot. Now when I started uni all of that went out the window. Complete freedom to do whatever the hell I want meant that it was exactlly what I did. Result? I pretty much failed first year, but managed to stay. Second year? average 52% ( which was actually an improvement) Now, in my third year, I need at least 68% average to pass well. The year started October and to be honest things aren't looking too good so far. The biggest problem I have is to actually sit down and do the work necessary - motivation issues I guess. If the work isn't strictly necessary right now, or if it is but the result of not studying won't be felt for a while, then I can't motivate myself to study. By this point if I manage to study for 2 hours a day then I count it as a big success. Has anyone had motivational issues related to study / work like this (or similar) and had managed to turn it around? Any real-life advice would be great.

Research shows that there is only a ""core"" of 20-30% of individuals who procrastinate regardless of the curriculum. There are indeed many people who never procrastinate, and successful people tend to fall into that category. I have a solution, however. 

Before telling you the solution however, let's begin by defining procrastination as:

A conscious decision to do something that you believe to be unimportant

So far so good? When people say that they are procrastinating, they usually implicitly mean that they BELIEVE their current task to be unimportant compared to what they are putting off. 

So, with the definition out of the way, let's start analyzing the problem itself. 

Procrastination, the putting off of tasks you believe to be important, is a DECISION. And one that we universally believe to be bad and wrong. 

In a general sense, then, procrastination is making a wrong decision whilst being aware that the decision you are making is wrong. How is this possible? 

If we had a choice, and we do have this choice, would we choose to do something that we believe is wrong, over something that we believe is right? 

As it happens, YES! Decades of psychological research have shown that people's actions have little relation to their beliefs. So people believe in one thing whilst doing something completely contrary to their beliefs. This creates cognitive dissonance, which is usually solved by changing their beliefs to match their behavior. 

Of course, pop-psychology will have you believing that procrastination is caused by anxiety, perfectionism, fear of failure, lack of achievement motivation and other nonsense. Research has proven that perfectionists do not procrastinate, anxiety is CAUSED by procrastination, rather than the other way round, and fear of failure only accounts for a quarter of procrastinators and might well be based on fact (i.e the procrastinator's fear of failure is logical). So much for that. Depressed people are not necessarily procrastinators, either. To date, no studies exist to link achievement motivation to procrastination, and a number of studies (e.g Taylor 1979) have found no signicant differences between procrastinators and punctual students in achievement motivation. 

Counter-intuitive perhaps, but that is the truth. We do not make decisions that we believe is right, even when we are making the decision. We recognize what we are doing is wrong, and we continue doing it! This is known as the Value-Action gap or the Attitude-Action gap in psychology, and it's why personality tests are useless in predicting behavior. 

All studies agree that past behavior is the best predictor of future behavior (and even then it's not very good, with prediction rates averaging less than 50%). Attitudes and beliefs are not good predictors of behavior at all. 

Well, it turns out this is not so simple. There is a theory which posits that there are 2 types of people, one type of person's actions are predicted by his situation, and another type of person's actions are predicted by his traits. I don't think this theory has very much validity here because we don't have much control over either situation (we can't remove video games or the internet, for example) or traits (we can't make you into a highly conscientious person). In any case, past behavior remains the best predictor of future behavior. 

If you procrastinated often in the past, you are most likely to procrastinate often in the future. An easy fact to grasp, but not an easy fact to explain. 

I shall begin to explain this with Skinner's Behaviorism, an easily understood theory. We are living organisms and all living organisms are conditioned by environmental stimuli. More specifically, there are environmental Rewards and Punishments, where Rewards are events that increase the likelihood of you repeating your behavior, and Punishments are events that decrease the likelihood of you repeating your behavior. 


Using Behaviorism to Explain Procrastination
--------------------------------------------

Using Skinner's Behaviorism to understand Procrastination is very simple. People who procrastinate were simply brought up badly. They were not punished for procrastination, and since procrastination tends to be more pleasurable than doing the activity itself, procrastination became an engrained behavior. The problem with using Behaviorism to explain Procrastination is that people ARE punished for procrastination (e.g not revising before a test gets you bad marks and angry parents), and people ARE rewarded for NOT procrastinating (e.g revising before a test gets you good marks and happy parents). 

The Behaviorist counterargument might be that the Punishments and Rewards are inconsistently applied, or that they are DISCOUNTED due to PRESENT BIAS. 


Using the Theory of Planned Behavior to Explain Procrastination
---------------------------------------------------------------

The theory of Planned Behavior on the other hand states that an individual's behaviors are controlled by attitude toward behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. 

Behavioral belief: an individual's belief about consequences of particular behavior. The concept is based on the subjective probability that the behavior will produce a given outcome. Some procrastinators may be convinced that it is really not worthwhile revising for the upcoming exam or writing their paper. Still others hold the opposite belief. This cannot be explained by this theory. 

Normative belief: an individual's perception about the particular behavior, which is influenced by the judgment of significant others (e.g., parents, spouse, friends, teachers). Most procrastinators' parents, spouses, friends and teachers hold a negative view of procrastination, so this does not explain why people procrastinate either. 

Perceived behavioral control: an individual's perceived ease or difficulty of performing the particular behavior. This seems to be most relevant to procrastination as people tend to put off harder tasks rather than easier ones. 

However it does not explain people who put off easy tasks such as dishwashing. Dishwashing is not difficult, does not require much time, effort, or concentration. Yet it is often put off. Why? Well, people can argue that procrastinators tend to have lower self-efficacy. Whether low self-efficacy is a causal factor, or whether if low self-efficacy is caused by something else, like procrastination, I don't know. It makes more sense that low self-efficacy is caused by chronic procrastination than the other way round.

2. Click 'my subreddits' then 'view all'

3. Unsubscribe from every irrelevant subreddit and only leave ones that help you be productive.

the subreddits i have left include only ones that have meaning and relevance to my tasks and goals i want to get done
so i have only left productivity related ones, also ones that relate to music, cooking and fitness. this way i'll never get distracted by a stupid meme again... in theory

i'm sure many of you have done this before, will be interesting to see what subreddits you will have left.

I have all signs of ADHD  and have been a major procrastinator all my life. It was depressing to think of all the undone tasks. It is easiest to use my busy schedule as an excuse. However, I finally grokked GTD and it is working for me.

I sat down and dumped just about everything that came to mind in OmniFocus. Took some tries to create the projects and contexts and it is a work in progress but getting there. Now, even something as simple as clean the house gets split into multiple tasks like clean living room, clean bathroom and so on. Those are further broken down into clean surfaces, put things in place, clean carpet etc. There is a context created called, •today's tasks"". Every night, before going to bed, I move tasks to be finished next day in this context and work on them till they are done or I run out of time.

Second, created tracking notebooks in Evernote and write quick notes about how each task was handled.

In the beginning, it was a mountain to be leveled with a spoon. However,, I realized the importance of estimating amount of time, granularity of tasks and accounting for interruptions. This has become surprisingly easy to manage with passage of time.

When I started, I listed nearly 150 tasks that had to be done over the weekends. However, I have manage to finish them all, except the recurring ones like washing dishes, taking the children out to play etc.

Rewrite/Reorganize your goals. Just the act of writing and paraphrasing will force you to ponder the best way to achieve it. Reword it and include a measurable result. If the goal seems too big, break it up into smaller more manageable chunks. If you don't have your goals and the steps necessary to achieve them written out in some way, shape, or form - do it! David Allen is spot on when he says to get it out of your head.


Get Tagging. Search is a beautiful thing especially when you leverage tags. Things to tag on your lists include the GTD favorites, #projects or #nextaction. Many list tools out there today are location aware but the two essentials for me are @home and @office. More tags to consider are time-based tags and wellness tags like #run, #breathe and #balance


Track it. If it's worth creating a goal for, it's worth tracking your progress. The habit of performing the task and tracking the result regularly will help to get it ingrained and you may just find yourself performing the task for the mere satisfaction of tracking the progress.

For checklist task management, it's great; I can monitor all of our tasks, update them, see their status, delegate, and close them out as we finish.  What I can't do, however, is manage a more ticket-like system where I can push out certain tasks by duration.

What I'm looking to do is set a time duration on some of my tasks, with actual due dates on others, so that I could theoretically shuffle tasks based on changing priorities and it'd update the due dates for the rest of the list.  I'd think this would be possible in some sort of drag/drop format.  It feels to me like a hybrid between a true checklist with due dates (eg - Asana) and something very, very robust (Microsoft Project).  There has to be something in the middle...

Is there something like that out there?  I've been poking around and signing up for sites all over the place (can't wait for the spam emails...), but none of them seem to serve my purpose.  We're not a true ""project,"" since it's really a contract-based rendering of services over a pre-defined period.

As you know, I have read a lot about procrastination and willpower. I've come to the conclusion that willpower, as it is commonly defined, does not exist, or at least there is no reason to believe that it exists. I might be described as a behaviourist or logical positivist or eliminative materialist. Philosophy does not interest me. The point is that I no longer accept hypothetical constructs such as ""the mind"", ""the ego"", ""the id"", ""the superego"", ""the will"", ""intentions"", ""willpower"", ""desires"", ""passions"", ""emotions"", ""feelings"" and so forth. Yes, I am aware that some people argue there is a so-called ""limbic system"", that the amygdala is somehow responsible for ""emotions"", that the ""neocortex"", or the prefrontal cortex, is somehow responsible for planning and inhibition. Does this mean that we can somehow stop procrastination by removing the parts of the brain responsible for impulsive behaviour? Lobotomy turned out not to have been so successful after all (most patients either died or were permanently incapacitated); perhaps we don't know nearly as much about the brain as we think we did. The point is that neuroscience, in its current stage of development, does not have any answers for resolving procrastination. The only answers, therefore, must come from observational studies, and theories constructed with the ""black box"" analogy. Enter the Procrastination Equation. 

==The Procrastination Equation==

Piers Steel is a researcher in the field of procrastination; this guy actually studies procrastination for a living. He helpfully constructed an equation to predict procrastination. There is obviously no explanation, but the fact that this equation can at least be quantified, even roughly, makes it infinitely more useful than all of the theories on procrastination previously discussed.  

At this point, you would be tempted to go on google and search for ""the procrastination equation"" and sure enough, one of the results is lesswrong.com/lw/3w3/how_to_beat_procrastination/ which did the same thing I am doing: use the procrastination equation to try to beat procrastination. 

There are a few flaws with his method, however, which I will delve into. But first, let's take look at the procrastination equation itself:



Motivation = (Expectancy x Value) / (Impulsiveness x Delay)



Where:
Expectancy = likelihood of being rewarded
Value = how much you like the task
Impulsiveness = how impulsive you are
Delay = how long before you get the reward



Now onto the website that I linked to earlier - lesswrong.com:


&gt;To beat procrastination, we need to:
&gt;Increase your expectancy of success.

Yes, we want to increase our likelihood of receiving the reward. Who wouldn't? If it were at all possible, we would have done it already. This is a pretty useless piece of advice. 

&gt;Increase the task's value (make it more pleasant and rewarding).

This is more interesting. But we need to go into more details to find out exactly how this guy intends to make the task more attractive. 

&gt;Decrease your impulsiveness.

Dohohoho. Through what, meditation and mindfulness? Taking pills? If you've read my previous post on this issue, you'd know that I advocate mindfulness. Yet even I know that mindfulness is pretty fucking difficult especially when you are trying to concentrate. How can you fully focus on the task when you are fully focused on stopping yourself from doing impulsive things? Doesn't quite work out does it? This is a pretty useless bit of advice. 

Now we come to the real meat and bones of the advice:

&gt;Optimizing Optimism
&gt;One way to build your optimism for success is to make use of success spirals.11 When you achieve one challenging goal after another, your obviously gain confidence in your ability to succeed. So: give yourself a series of meaningful, challenging but achievable goals, and then achieve them! Set yourself up for success by doing things you know you can succeed at, again and again, to keep your confidence high.

Optimism! Just be confident! It doesn't really work. Ever heard of depressive realism? Being confident doesn't make you more likely to succeed at the task, it will simply make your failure all the more spectacular. 

Expectancy isn't even an issue in most forms of procrastination. Students who procrastinate on writing a paper know that they CAN write the paper, pupils who delay on revising for an exam know that they CAN revise for the exam. People who put off washing the dishes probably aren't under any illusion that they physically can't wash the dishes. So that renders this piece of advice pretty much worthless. Let's see what's next:

&gt;If the task you're avoiding is boring, try to make it more difficult, right up to the point where the difficulty level matches your current skill, and you achieve ""flow.""21 This is what the state troopers of Super Troopers did: they devised strange games and challenges to make their boring job passable. Myrtle Young made her boring job at a potato chip factory more interesting and challenging by looking for potato chips that resembled celebrities and pulling them off the conveyor belts.

Okay, this is where he is wrong. Making a task more difficult definitely does not increase its appeal. It will almost certainly become less attractive as a result. You do not achieve ""flow"", which is a feeling of ease, by making the task more demanding and difficult. You achieve flow by getting so good at the task that you don't even have to think about it, it becomes so easy that it's relaxing. You do not get into a state of flow by making the task even more challenging than it already is. 

&gt;It also helps to make sure tasks are connected to something you care about for its own sake,22 at least through a chain: you read the book so you can pass the test so you can get the grade so you can get the job you want and have a fulfilling career. 

Yeah, so repeat the same old stuff that your parents and teachers drone on about every day to yourself. Does it work? Not even once. 

&gt;Obviously, tasks are harder when you don't have much energy.23 Tackle tasks when you are most alert. This depends on your circadian rhythm,24 but most people have the most energy during a period starting a few hours after they wake up and lasting 4 hours.25 Also, make sure to get enough sleep and exercise regularly.26

Here we go again. ""Sleep more"", ""do more exercise"". The same general advice that gets handed out to every problem regardless of what it is. Do you really think people don't know this already? How is it going to help people who already sleep 12 hours a day?

&gt;One obvious way to inject more value into a task is to reward yourself for completing it.27 Also, mix bitter medicine with sweet honey. Pair a long-term interest with a short-term pleasure.28 Find a workout partner whose company you enjoy. Treat yourself to a specialty coffee when doing your taxes. I bribe myself with Pinkberry frozen yogurt to do things I hate doing.

Yes, so basically reward yourself for doing something. This approach doesn't work, partially because you can cheat, and partially because if the task is unattractive enough that you will procrastinate on it, it's unattractive that you would forgo the reward just to avoid the task. 

&gt;Of course, the most powerful way to increase the value of a task is to focus on doing what you love wherever possible. It doesn't take much extra motivation for me to research meta-ethics or write summaries of scientific self-help: that is what I love to do. Some people who love playing video games have made careers out of it. To figure out which career might be full of tasks that you love to do, taking a RIASEC personality test might help. In the USA, O*NET can help you find jobs that are in-demand and fit your personality.

Yes, the same old ""do what you love"" nonsense that people like Steve Jobs prattle on about all the time. 

Let's think about it for one second: if people all did what they loved, they'd all be professional gamers, footballers and movie critics. How many gamers, footballers and movie critics actually earn enough money to make a living from just playing games, football and watching movies? Do you really think society would continue to function if everyone played video games, football and watched movies all day long? 

Fact is that we can't all be professional gamers, footballers and movie critics, as much as we all love playing video games, playing football and watching movies. Not everyone can do what they love, unfortunately. Yes we are trying our best to get there, but until The Singularity actually happens, most of us have to work for a living, work that we are often not particularly passionate about. 

Which makes this piece of advice completely useless. Next:

&gt;One method is to ""throw away the key"": Close off tempting alternatives. Many people see a productivity boost when they decide not to allow a TV in their home; I haven't owned one in years. But now, TV and more is available on the internet. To block that, you might need a tool like RescueTime. Or, unplug your router when you've got work to do.

This does not reduce impulsiveness at all. All it does is close off certain avenues for impulsiveness. Before, when you wanted to watch TV, you would go watch it. Now that you don't have a TV, you would just be sitting there reminiscing your old TV-watching days. Hardly increased productivity.

So I was wondering if there was a resource online that I could use to motivate myself to start reading middle-school level books, and once I feel comfortable reading at that level, progress to more challenging material until I can read grad school level literature without struggling.

It's not particularly comfortable and working in my bedroom next to the bed and the PS3 takes a lot of my attention and eats at my willpower. I try to stay at home so it saves me money because I don't make too much at my part-time job but there's usually all sorts of business in the house. There's a baby around and the mother from the family I stay with talks to me nearly constantly, even when i have my headphones in and am trying to get things done she tells me about the guy who mows the lawn. I like the idea of going to coffeeshops, but there's not many around here and my laptop is near-junk status as is. I can go to my previous university and use the computers but the trip is about 2 hours each way. Anyway, maybe I'm just looking for reasons NOT to do anything, but truth is I'm sick of my surroundings and want to get out of this place. I'm a bit put-down by the job-search as is, as it's kind of just like playing the lottery, and even though I was a pretty excellent student I don't feel too empowered by it all. 

Edit: I used to be medicated for ADHD as well, but don't have access to the same psychiatrist since I no longer attend Uni, and to see a new one would cost a lot. I'm also trying to explore productivity without the use of medication.

Edit 2: Best advice so far, split the day up and my living situation up into more compartamentalized structures. A time and place(room) for work, and a time/place(living room) for play. Great advice.

I just like to workout. But I have managed to be productive in my cardio by bringing my tablet (asus TF101) to the Gym on the treadmill and watching my television shows like walking dead, Spartacus, The Simpsons, and Parks and Recreation. That plus my noise isolating Klipsh earbuds make the cardio go by like nothing. Also good for audio books. Never tried reading on the tablet but I wouldn't imagine it would be easy for anything outside of a comic book. 

This may be hard if you do Intervals but for Low Intensity Steady State (4.0 mph at a 1% incline for fat burning) it works like a charm. 

Bonus Tip: Buy the earbuds with a mic (aka a headset) and you can make the calls you need to make while doing LISS cardio.

But this year for me, I want to do something a bit different.

I'm at a point in my life where I want to make good life changes, and be an all around more productive person. At the end of 2012 I realized that I was not happy with the person I was, and was afraid of the person I would become if things kept going the same way. So I've decided its time to do something about it.

So keeping this central theme of self improvement in mind, I made it this year's challenge to read 50 books. But not just any 50 books, books that would make me more productive, more social, give me practical skills in business (I'm a marketing major), and just all around create a better individual in me. 

So this is where you guys come in. What books would you guys recommend for me? What books have changed your thought processes or just made you an all around better person? Anything in marketing, self improvement, time management, entrepreneurship, management, or anything that you could even think about would be great.

I wanted to share something that I have been doing and that is keeping me productive but still ""in-the-know"" on my favorite blogs and websites.

I use a site called [IFTTT](http://www.ifttt.com).com (If This Then That, it allows you to setup a type of real life loop that checks for something, and does something if that happens.) to do most of the work for me. 

With IFTTT I have setup a recipe for each site that I follow. It checks the RSS feed of that site, and if it is updated, it posts the article to my [Pocket](http://www.getpocket.com) reader account. 

For sites that have a TON of content, and I don't necessarily read all of it, I have an IFTTT recipe setup so that if I start something in google reader, it sends it to pocket. 

Every morning, I scan the headlines in Google Reader, and if something catches my attention I star it. All other websites and blogs that I follow and want to read are automatically put into Pocket. 

Now, whenever I have some down time and I want to read articles that interest me. Rather than taking my 10 minute break to slog through some RSS feeds, I just go to pocket and everything is of interest and ready to be read. 

Additionally, you can setup IFTTT to automatically add a video that you have marked as ""Watch Later"" on YouTube into Pocket. So when I want to watch videos, rather than getting distracted by kittens for 30 minutes, I go to Pocket and watch exactly what I need to. 

I wanted to share this with you all, in case you hadn't heard of either [Pocket](http://www.getpocket.com) or [IFTTT](http://www.ifttt.com). Hopefully you will find it as awesome as I have.

1) I'd like a hybrid hierarchical tagging system, so if I tag something restaurant and new-york, I can look at the top level category of ""restaurant"" and get all notes tagged restaurant, then I can drill down and have ""new-york"" as an option, which would filter only for new-york restaurants.
2) tag subordination, so I can make a tag a child of another tag. For example, ""bar"" is a child of tag ""restaurant"", so if I filter by restaurants, it automatically finds tags of bar as well
3) Android/iPad/PC native functionality.

Anything like that out there?

We have been using it in house for 18 months or so, and apart from a couple of issues I am pretty pleased with it (for my own personal needs anyway).

We had an internal meeting today to discuss moving it forward and getting it ready for public use. Suggestions were made which changes it quite significantly. Fundamentally means changing it from a primarily list based format, to being managed as a calendar in a similar manner to Teux Deux.

I am not opposed to these changes, but I was hoping for more of a list of things to polish / tweak, and get the project out of stealth mode and get some people using it + giving feedback, not having to rethink the entire project and put back external use many more months (building it around other paid work).

Wondered what people here think? I would say the majority of systems out there at the mo use list based layouts, some do calendar based layouts but are VERY basic (too basic for developer team needs), and some try to mix them up a bit and do neither as well.

What are peoples preferences, why, and what systems have you used that you like?

Several years ago, I realized that I had some shit to fix in my life. I was very overweight, hadn't been in a healthy relationship in a while, and I hated my job and having a boss. I make no claims that I've got everything figured out, but I was able to go from 225-&gt;184lbs, have a relationship I considered healthy, with a wonderful girl. I've since moved on, but that's neither here nor there. Lastly, I now work as a freelancer, and find myself much happier.

I did most by deciding to keep things simple, and not get overwhelmed. Basically, I decided, I would do a minimum of one thing towards a maximum of three goals (narrow focus) every day. EVERY day. In order to track this, I changed my browser's home page to a google docs spreadsheet, and entered the work I did every day. It worked pretty well.

After doing this for a while, and achieving a number of my goals, I had a conversation with my friend steve. He liked the idea of doing one thing / day, and tracking it with google docs homepage. Ditto for my friend chris. Ditto for my friend Jamie. Most people I talked to liked the idea, but felt the google docs part was a little kludgy, and didn't like the idea of not having google as their homepage. I mostly agreed, and decided I'd put together a small site which would serve the same purpose - track your goals, give a bit more visible feedback (big ass green checkmarks) and have an embedded google search, so you get the best of both worlds.

It's still (very much) in beta. It's not incredibly pretty, some features are missing (email reminders will be added at some point, etc) but I thought that some people might find it useful. I'd really appreciate any feedback. Since I don't just want to open the firehose completely, I'm going to enable 25 people to join / day.

 * [here is a link to a screenshot to give you an idea of what it looks like](http://www.icreatedthis.com/images/website_example.png)
 * [and here is a link to the beta signup page](http://www.icreatedthis.com/index.php/user/create/BETAINVITE/reddit/)

I hope you guys find it useful. I'm kinda nervous about putting it out there, since I never really feel like coding projects are good enough to  go public with.

Good luck with achieving your goals, and creating the life you want to live, 
Nick

Bento is perfect - we can lay everything out the way we want, have different libraries for different clients and billing months, and see the video and scripts right in the form.

But there are 2 maddening things that are keeping us from using it the way we want.

1) We can use Bento with multiple users on the same network, but I do most of my work at home and can't access it (I know about the dropbox workaround but that would mean every time I want to use it I have to make sure everyone at the studio has closed the app)

2) Videos are stored within the database itself, but scripts are not!  Which means even with the dropbox workaround, if I add a script to the database from my computer, when they open it up on their end the script won't show up because the file is on my computer.

I never loved school work but I did it the best of my ability. At some ill-defined point in my junior year, I stopped being able to work much at all.  Something just kind of snapped.  Since that time, I have never been able to really do good school work (I'm in grad school now) without a TREMENDOUS amount of pain.  And sometimes, I simply CANNOT DO IT AT ALL.  I want to do it.  And I cannot. This is several steps beyond procrastination.  More like paralysis. Obviously I've been able to muddle through but like I said, academic work causes excruciating pain, it's always turned in late, and on occasion, it just doesnt get done at all.  So two questions:  1. What the f*&amp;k is wrong with me? 2. Assuming the first cannot be answered (and yes I have seen several shrinks), all I really need to know is how to fix it.

I patrol about a dozen subreddits, and while unfortunately my favorite ones are pretty dead (physics, math, productivity), my secondary choices (fffuuuu--ahem) are quite active.  Here's my trick:  browse through all of reddit that you want, but always open articles (including self posts) in a new tab.  Do NOT go read an article that looks interesting immediately; instead, open everything in a new tab and then CLOSE the reddit window when you're ready to start reading.  This way none of the articles have back buttons that lead back to reddit, and it's easy to tell yourself once you've exhausted the articles that you've opened everything that was interesting and now it's time to move on to work.


I'm not sure if the best part of this for me is having the set of tabs eventually decay into a closed window, presenting my desktop and thus the question ""what next?"", or if it's not having the default behavior available of clicking back and autopilot hunting for more articles.  Either way, this is one of the best lifehacking tricks I've come up with for myself in terms of actual productive hours gained (rescued).

Met many good friends along the way and I felt completely supported as I climbed the corporate ladder steadily at a (relatively) young age for my field of expertise. Then I got promoted to a senior specialist - I had a choice of working in a mediocre but easy-going company, or a top-class but brutal ball-busting company with a guy that sleeps 3h a day at its helm. I chose the latter. 

My god. Everyone was pushing everyone else down to get ahead. I am usually quite trusting and ready to help when needed but I got completely killed in that environment. 

Others who were stagnant in their roles were envious of my sudden elevation in status (and me being brought in as an outsider) and manipulated mid-rank bosses to hand me dead-end assignments with shifting or impossible goalposts. Information was with-held.  My work suffered, I had to work longer and longer hours, my marriage fell apart, I lost a lot of friends.

Months passed, I found it more and more difficult to function at work as the team around me disintegrated. It did not help that a high level petty minded boss took a dislike to me. Everything I did was wrong. Simple jobs became impossible. 

To cut a long story short: After a year, I was told I was underperforming and I was fired. My mysterious assistant that I had been unknowingly training for the last six months (this was how long they knew they'd be getting rid of me) was promoted to be put in my place. I was also told that I should consider employment in a completely different industry as I was severely incompetent.

I spent six months searching for more and more junior employment - a few more mild-mannered bosses assured me they would help me out but I found out by accident by a job recruitment agency that the remarks they had free-handed in the reference were what got my resume tossed in the bin.

Wising up, I went back to my old place of employment and practically begged for my old job back. Then got a new set of referees. 

Finally used the leverage to get back into the same subspecialty, slightly more junior than the one I was working at in the nightmare company, in a different country. Moved my entire life to accommodate this. Sold all my possessions. 

Been here two years - love it. I am recapturing the same enthusiasm and energy that I used to have in the old days. 

Recently I have been told that I got an interview for the exact same position that I had three years ago (senior specialist). Since there are only roughly twenty of us spread across the country, everybody knows everybody's history.

I have started sleeping badly and I wake up at 3am with a horrible knot in my stomach. I am suffering great anxiety because I know that to succeed in this particular field I will need to present the facade that I am completely in control and paradoxically that will be impossible with this sudden anxiety that I am experiencing. 

I will be interviewing alongside previous colleagues who are junior to me. My contemporaries have moved on.

My doctor thinks I have PTSD and has prescribed anxiolytics but the meds make me feel like a dopey 1950s housewife not a high achieving business woman.

How do I overcome this?

I work roughly 43 hours a week at a restaurant from Wednesday to Sunday. With this schedule I work doubles on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays since it's the busiest time of the week. Meanwhile on my days off, I'm a graphic designer on the side. While I get my work done for my clients at the time promised, I find it hard to keep my creativity going on my off days (Mondays and Tuesdays) and find myself being distracted with errands or general laziness. 



I try making to-do lists but they usually get cast aside. Waking up in the morning, I try do a bit of a workout routine, but that's about as far as my diligence goes when there isn't anything pending on my design plate.



Am I burning myself out? I'm looking all the time for a new job so I don't have to work these crazy hours but I need something to break this cycle now.

tl;dr I want to write a productivity application that monitors how much you get done and implements various strategies to try to increase that. An individual user could monitor how different strategies affected their productivity. As a group, users could choose to share their anonymous numerical data of their success (or otherwise) so that we can predict which strategies are likely to make the biggest difference to the most people.

The long version:

I suck at keeping on top of my jobs and I suck at motivating myself to get stuff done. I don't think I'm the only one out there. I want to improve this, and am wondering if technology could help. Here's my idea.

We write an app that provides basic task management. You tell it what you need to do and when you actually get stuff done. Something like taskwarrior or todo.txt. The simpler and cleaner the better. No tags, no start dates, no context lists, no ABC priorities etc. Most importantly, it would rate your ""productivity"" from day-to-day i.e. how much shit you're getting done each day.

Then, people write plugins on top of that core. Plugins could do any number of things to implement hacks or strategies to increase productivity:

* Store more information about tasks, such as which context they should be done in (like GTD) or what priority you attach to a task (like ABC analysis);
* Note when a task has been on your list for a long time, and add tasks to your list to try to deal with that (e.g ""Consider breaking down task X into smaller tasks"" or ""Journal about why you may be resisting task X"");
* Remind you to do stuff by sending you SMS messages or IM messages;
* Make a list of rewards and put one of those on your list every now and again;
* Decide at the start of the day what tasks you want to get done and then promise yourself you will go and play when you've finished;
* Remind you to take a break every so often;
* Add specific one off tasks on an irregular basis (say yearly), such as ""Thoroughly tidy your work space"";
* Ask you to write down why you're doing what you're doing when you enter the task;
* Add a daily habit to your list (e.g meditation or exercise);
* Precommit to some task or goal (like Stickk)
* And lots and lots of other things for other people to think of...

Over a period of time, a user could obtain statistics on their productivity using different plugins. From there, they could use the plugins that maximised their productivity. They could also develop new plugins based on the most successful of the ones they'd already used.

For those users that wanted to, they could anonymously share the numerical results of using certain plugins. Again, over time, a picture would hopefully develop of the most effective plugins. Further, the app could even use affinity analysis (like Amazon's recommendations) to say something like: ""You found plugin A effective. Other users who liked plugin A, also liked plugins B, C and D.""

The app could even be put on autopilot, adding plugins automagically based upon the anonymously submitted statistics of others.

I have been using this sub-reddit and others for a while for motivation and general tips on how to lead a more efficient and effective lifestyle. Here's a tip on something I've discovered that's easy to implement but very useful, at least for me. It's not new or novel, but it is useful.

I struggle from being forgetful, and I'm sure many of you do as well. It's normal. Everyday you have things you plan to accomplish but the day doesn't ever go as planned. We are constantly met with new tasks and problems, minor or major, that we must deal with on the fly. These things paired with those we've already planned to do, can make a day cluttered. Remembering everything can be next to impossible, and doing it all in a time-efficient manner is worse.

The easy tip to combat this clutter, I've realized, is to write things down. As I head out to run my errands or go to work or school, I have a pad of post-its and a pen. That's all it takes, some blank paper and a writing utensil. I realized I'm often planning late at night the day before, so I've taken to writing down my plans at this time.

I write down everything I want to remember to absolutely do in little blurbs. ""fix sink,"" ""return shoes,"" ""fix your CV,"". Easy things that I keep planning on doing, but can easily be put off until the next day.

The benefits of writing things down are threefold. First of all, you don't have to constantly remind yourself of your plans. You have it written down. It might not seem like much but being able to focus on the task at hand knowing it's impossible to forget any other planned activities is  relaxing. Furthermore, having it written down in front of you will entice you to get that thing done *right now*. You realize what you have, and since it's in writing it's a real task, not just a mental note that you can disregard. I've accomplished so many things sooner than I would have if I hadn't written it down. Lastly, and most importantly, when you are met with new tasks as the day goes on, just add it to the list and now you can't forget that either, and it gains the first two benefits I've stated too.

I know this sounds kind of nutty. Writing things down can't persuade you to accomplish them, right? I thought the same, but you'd be surprised how much more willing you are to do things that are listed in the real world as opposed to just in your mind. The best though, is completing a task, and crossing it off. As the day goes on and more tasks are crossed off, as menial as they may be, you can really be *shown* how well you used the time you had in the day.

Anyway,  this is just a suggestion, and I hope you guys give it a try. It really helped me with my daily planning and forgetfulness, and I believe it can help others too.

These are things that have helped me. Please post your experiences.

First of all, I found [Getting Things Done](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done) really helpful. This was a good practical guide. I didn't follow it to the letter, but I used the parts I really liked and it has stuck with me for years now.

**Find good influences**

I've also found that surrounding yourself with motivated people is incredibly important. You'll find these people at special interest groups and organizations that promote your field of work. Work in the tech industry? Go to user groups. Are you in marketing? Go to market groups. When you're around people who are going above and beyond, you'll find yourself emulating that behaviour.


**Extreme productivity**

1. **Use a Thinking couch/chair** - Taking a ten minute break every two hours to retire to a comfy chair/couch helps me re-organize priorities and focus on what's important. The key element is to jar you out of the immediate task and prioritise.
2. **Productivity Log** - See below. I broke it out, because I feel it needs more explanation. It has worked very well for me.
3. **Hotkeys!** - Every time you look for your mouse, you're actually breaking concentration just a tiny bit. It seems trivial, but the alternative is very effective. For programs you use at work, take the time to learn it's hotkeys.
4. **Create a talk-free work-flow** - Identify incoming work and outgoing deliverables end-points and create ways for people to give and take from them without having to come over to your desk. Also automate things you need authorized this way. And if you're getting bogged down with frivolous and incoherent requests, create a small form to force a structured communication.


**Productivity log**

I do this in high-pressure situations, or when I start to get lazy. Every half-hour, I jot down what I've done on the left side of my notebook. On the right side of the page, I'll jot down things that are blocking progress or interrupting me. Examples: folders have too many sub-folders; forgot things at home; need to automate x task; need approval for x task. When the day is done, I will go over every issue on the right side of page, and think of a remedy and write it down. 

This helps with three things: 

1. Gives me an objective record of my workday and output.
2. Identify and remember issues that are interrupting me and blocking me from getting work done
4. Prioritize on what issues need to be addressed (really good for identifying recurring problems too)

The good thing is that this system works even if you're naturally lazy. As long as you're writing down what you did every half hour and what is impeding your progress, you will notice and remember recurring problems, and will start to realize how many things are bringing you down. Giving attention to these things will make you aware of just how time consuming they can be. Being aware of this, you'll naturally be more inclined to do something about them, since your perspective on them has changed.

Anyways, that's my list! Hope it helps. I'm eager to see any things you guys use!",,False,,t5_2qh1k,1367815966.0,,,True,t3_1drxhs,http://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1drxhs/notes_and_discussion_on_productivity/,

I seem to have lost it. ,gingus418,18,2,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/egabu/how_do_i_get_my_motivation_to_do_workproductivity/,"**TLDR:** I can't seem to get myself to do the work I should be doing and it's making me frustrated, which makes me not want to do the work more. It's a very bad positive feedback loop that I've gotten myself into. 



I'm nearing the end of my second to last semester in college and it seems that I've been getting lazier and lazier. I have a fairly large senior thesis looming, which I've started, but one of the first ""deadlines"" is next week. Granted, I've started the first chapter, although am not nearly satisfied with what I've written. I need to do more research and need to do much more revisions. That being said, I've instead been spending way too much time on the internet and have been devoting a lot of my energy towards work for my other classes and now am finding it difficult to even work on those things. An example: I stayed up until 4:30 am last night working on a short story for one of my other classes last night when I should have been asleep. 


It's like my desires to do well, or at the very least not be stressed out, have gone out the window. I know I should be working right now, but I can't seem to bring myself to do it.


My Background: I've generally been a straight A/B+ kinda guy with my work ethic and grades. While I know I have a habit of procrastination, its something I've always done, I feel like its getting worse and that's not something that I need right now. How can I reverse it?


Any suggestions?

I am currently using GQueues, which is nice because it integrates with my Google Calendar. But I'm planning on switching away from GQueues because:

* It does not have any desktop apps, to allow quick entry or offline mode from computers
* I am unable to get notification reminders for events with a date/time to work at all

I'm hoping to find a solution with the following capabilites:

* Runs on Windows, Mac, and Android
* Has offline capabilites for each platform
* Can quickly add a task on any platform - like a global hotkey for Windows/Mac, or a homescreen widget for Android
* Can send reminders for tasks with dates/times to my phone - a notification, text message, or email would all be fine
* Google Calendar integration would be a godsend - but isn't totally necessary

I am hoping that you will tell me about the task management solution you use, what features it provides, and why you stick with it.

It is a naff example but I say this because I have millions of things to do but I can rarely do them, or at least spend long periods of time on them.I have tried pomodoro and GTD etc but my mind is pretty good at justifying things I should not be doing.

My last 30 day challenge was to ban all news sites, reddit etc from being accessed and it mainly worked, but I did not get more done. 

I am writing this post after I was supposed to be cleaning my house and literally stopped halfway through because I lost focus and got bored. It is affecting my work and my life in general, I get bored and distracted too easy, often annoying others.

1362405312.0,14,self.productivity,19myil,Need advice on how to deal with a bureaucratic black hole of a government project.,iworkforagovernment,17,3,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/19myil/need_advice_on_how_to_deal_with_a_bureaucratic/,"Background: I am assigned to this project (not my idea!) and it's in an area that I am not an expert in.  My field is accounting and this project is software/database related.  I was assigned here because technically I am a ""student"" so my salary comes from a separate budget that won't be allocated to this project.

I would quit but if I hold out I can get a good job in a separate department down the road so I am stuck here for at least another few months.  I've mostly given up hope that this project will be a success but I'm doing my best to make an honest go at it.

*A few highlights*

* Project is almost double the initial budget and it maybe 60% complete
* Departments involved do not cooperate.  Dept One will be using the end product.  Dept Two has to sign off on it because it touches their systems. Dept Three is paying for it.
* The consultants who actually knew what they were doing were cancelled because they were overbudget.


*Here is what happens with the system design:*

* Department One says ""I want this""
* I communicate it to Department Two (often it has to be in a formal memo that gets reviewed by 2 managers before the decision maker sees it), they have a problem with it for whatever reason.  It usually takes them 2 months to get back to me.
* Department One then wants my team to find a solution that's happy to both, which happens sometimes, but usually Department Two ends up getting its way.

Imagine this process for practically every issue.  Even minor ones that have to be used for the project to work we will have to draft a memo, send it to two managers, make whatever edits they want, send it back to them.  They approve it or want MORE edits, then it gets sent to the decision maker.  The decision maker wants edits that we do then send it back to the manager who will approve it and send it to the decision maker.

This process takes one month minimum, usually 2 or 3.  There is a simple two paged policy that has been stuck in this process for 6 months.

*Items required from departments*

Sometimes we will need documentation of business processes or whatnot from Dept One.  in at least 1/2 of the cases Dept One and Dept Two will argue about whose responsibility it is to deliver those items.  Again they won't communicate directly, but through me.

*Conclusion*

I think the root problem is that the sign-off department really doesn't care about the project.  It's not their money used to implement it and it might require they do a little extra work once it's in place so it is in their best interest to delay it as much as possible with all this bureaucratic foolishness.

When I try to get them to talk to each other they are ""too busy"" constantly and will only communicate through guarded channels.

I'm ready to quit.  Is there any way I can get them to have productive discussions?",,False,,t5_2qh1k,False,,,True,t3_19myil,http://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/19myil/need_advice_on_how_to_deal_with_a_bureaucratic/,

1363771693.0,12,self.productivity,1ankij,Tips on staying focused during 4 hours worth of consecutive lectures?,lyonhardt,12,0,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1ankij/tips_on_staying_focused_during_4_hours_worth_of/,"During the week, I have a day where I have four consecutive, hour long lectures (followed by a couple of hours of tutes, but that's fine), and another day where I have three back to back lectures. Usually after 45-55 minutes we get a short 5-10 minute break. All my lectures begin at 8am.

My problem is that I'm usually fairly focused during the first lecture, maybe the second as well - but by the third lecture my attention is definitely nearly all gone and I just can't focus. Honestly though, I have never been that great at learning effectively from face to face lectures. These lectures are put up online, maybe the day after (although this isn't very reliable) - and when I am able to pause, write notes, refer to the textbook, etc at my own pace I'm understanding the material more. And going to the tutorials; doing questions, etc is just far more helpful.

Any ideas on how to stay focused during the lectures? I have been:

* Getting at least 7.5 hours of sleep the night before
* Meditating for 15-20 minutes nearly every morning for the past two weeks (I've noticed myself 'refocusing' on the lecture, the same way I would bring myself back to my breathing during meditation; it's not very effective yet - I can't sustain the focus - but it's something)
* I don't bring lecture notes, so that I am forced to write stuff down and focus. This works well during the first lecture or two. It's better than having printed slides out and pretending that I am taking anything in.
* I've been having a cup of green tea every morning, and drinking water during lectures if needed. I don't have breakfast otherwise though (I can see this being an issue, but I doubt it).

I'm aware there won't be a 'magic pill' or any quick-fixes to the problem, and that it will probably require me to build quite a bit of discipline, but any tips/ideas are appreciated.

**EDIT**

I'm editing in some thoughts just in case someone stumbles on this and wants to know some of my solutions. 

It seems like **writing notes beforehand is the way to go**. Thanks /u/cyanocobalamin

Instead of making 'thorough' notes, as suggested, I've been just trying to write the lecture notes out as fast as I can (white still being legible) the night before the lecture. Just due to the fact that I'm *writing*, I am thinking about the material, trying to make sense of it, gaining some understanding - and jotting down question marks and asterisks for stuff to pay attention to during the lecture. I absolutely hate playing 'catch-up' while note-taking during lectures so this is perfect and it just works - the lectures are just solidifying what I already mostly understand and filling in blanks. And at a later date, probably while revising I can make 'real' notes; thorough, summaries, flash cards, etc. 

My biggest problem was not being able to keep focused. Being prepared before hand in this manner helps a great deal with this - because I'm going in the lecture knowing what I have to do; pay attention and fill in the blanks. If I go in without preparation there is no way I'll actually 'learn'. Printing out lecture notes is an absolute waste of time, money and resources for me. Nothing will click if I'm reading, annotating and highlighting - I need to write.

Other helpful and simple tips:

* Sit near the front and put your phone away - only touch your phone during breaks if you absolutely have to.
* Ignore latecomers and distractions like other people's phones going off. These things shouldn't concern you enough to make you turn around and look at who it is - why would you? Thanks /u/grossly_ill-informed for these two.
* Get up and do something during little breaks; walk, stretch, anything physical. Thanks /u/Quasifrodo
* I'm not brave enough to take my laptop in to lectures; there's no way I'll stay on task. Some people like writing notes on word processors though. Maybe you should think about it yourself; do you *really* need the laptop? If you do - does it distract you? Is there any way to minimise these distractions? (Fireox/Chrome addons that block sites during certain hours for example. Hell, even unpinning Firefox from your taskbar so it's just *a tiny bit* more difficult to get to can help! If you're sitting at the front maybe you'll be too self-conscious to go through your favourite sites, etc.)

These are the more 'simple but effective' tips in my opinion, there are more helpful suggestions in the comments.",,False,,t5_2qh1k,1366181950.0,,,True,t3_1ankij,http://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1ankij/tips_on_staying_focused_during_4_hours_worth_of/,

If you take the time to learn and use them, they can be powerful tools of efficiency and save your hand a few trips to the mouse and back.

I love using keyboard shortcuts and learning new ones to add to my repertoire. Especially with emacs, I appreciate how much I can do quickly and easily without leaving the keyboard. I've recently started using org-mode as a task management system and been loving learning the slue of keyboard shortcuts associated with that tool. 

Beyond that, I know there are a lot of great shortcuts out there for all sorts of applications. Recently I started heavily using the Safari shortcuts for traversing back and forward in page history (""Cmd-["", ""Cmd-]"") and switching tabs (""Cmd-Shft-["", ""Cmd-Shift-]"").

What are your favorite, most heavily used shortcuts?
