So guys, i've realized I'm a little more distraught about the show ending than i thought I'd be. I've just been youtubing the best scenes over and over. about to buy all the seasons on DVD.

The fans were stated as the people who kept this show going, over and over again, and subway... lol

I think Levi really means that if we want a movie, we can make it happen. They'd only ask 5$, it reminds me of what louis CK did. What can we do to make this happen? who do we write to? would you want there to be a movie?

EDIT:ADD:http://blip.tv/chuckpodcast/103-goodbye-chuck-5919641
So, i found this guys blog, which i never knew about, but literally the first 10 minutes of this, perfectly explain whats going down:highlights:
""Chuck won't have a movie for a few years at least, according to fedak. First, Chuck needs syndication. Syndication will gain new viewers and a new revenue stream to WB from the chuck franchise. but first in order for WB to see the worth in that, PEOPLE NEED TO BUY THE DVDs.

The reason its so special to me, is because back when my ex broke up with me, and broke my heart to put it nicely, Chuck was one of the first things I discovered after being single. I knew of the show, and saw 1-2 episodes, but back then I wasn’t to interested and I didn’t watch a lot of TV.

Finding the show Chuck was one of the very few comforts I had in those trying times. I’ve had an interesting exciting and eventful life, but up until that point I can safely say, that was my lowest point. Emotionally, physically, mentality, everything about me was low. I didn’t know who I was, where I was going, or what I wanted, I resorted to drinking Jack every night to numb and dull the pain and discovering Chuck was something that gave me joy and laughter. To me, it helped curve that enormous pain and suffering I was feeling. I can go on about my breakup, but I want you to know, this breakup on top of my entire life of neglect and isolation really came to a boil, and I’m lucky I didn’t do anything that could ruin my life forever.

Now with the ending of Chuck not 10 minutes past, I have to say, it feels cathartic in a way. The show is over, its done, and finished. There won’t be another season, and with how I’ve gradually got over a lot of my issues, and working on more, with the ending of Chuck it almost feels like its helped me weather one of the worst parts of my life. You could say I’m putting to much thought and feeling into just a TV show, and you’d be right, I am, but at this moment I’m very sad and also ready to begin a new part of my life. Does a TV make me say this? No, but how I feel now, today, and when I started watching that show a few years ago, I can’t help but think, yes I am different, yes I am ready to move on, and I’m ready to start a new chapter. My 3 year soul searching is over, its time to pick my path, and never again be the Josh that I was resentful, ashamed, and embarrassed about.

Thank you Chuck for being one of the very few comforts that had helped guide me through a tough spot.

edit:I am somewhat of a poet, and decided to write a quick little poem because I'm drunk and nostalgic.

**Down a long and winding road, it comes to an end, or so I'm told. It ends with kissing, and thoughts of doubt, will she remember, or forever be without. I hoped and prayed this day never came, but now its here, so I'll smile all the same.**

TL;DR Chuck helped get through one of the worst times of my entire life. Some may say it literally saved my life. Also sorry if its to personal, I just wanted to express a writing.",,False,self,t5_2r4nd,True,,,True,t3_p028s,http://www.reddit.com/r/chuck/comments/p028s/why_chuck_means_a_lot_to_me/,

Okay, so I hopped on the bandwagon for Chuck a little bit late. I had seen the DVDs for seasons 1 and 2 awhile back but never considered watching it. I had read about Chuck on the Internet and I knew that the fifth and final season finished in January 2012 – I had heard all of these great things about the show and how the fan support behind it was so strong. 

Around the start of December last year: I am in the midst of my work placement as a student nurse. During my placement I had been having some pretty horrible days at work; to use an example, I was a lot like Chuck in Season 1 – I felt like I was stuck in a bad job, unsure if I even wanted to advance in the profession or be in it and lacked the confidence that I could do better.

After one particularly horrible shift, I decided that I needed some television therapy and picked up the Complete Box Set at a store that bared a lot of similarities to the Buy More (without the dysfunctional staff, at least to the public eye). 

I hardly need to describe how great the show is to a sub-reddit that is dedicated to it but oh my goodness, I was addicted after the first episode, no, the first 10 minutes of the episode. I was like: I have truly come across something that is completely and totally ‘awesome’. I think I watched the first 5 episodes in one sitting. I mean, I couldn’t remember the last time a show like Chuck made me laugh and cry and feel so much emotion for the characters. I loved how much I could relate to Chuck and often felt like I was going through not only the same insecurities, self-doubt and lack of self-confidence but also the growth. Needless to say but Chuck really helped me get through my placement. 

It is kind of funny because I actually managed to get my family to watch the show with me too. I would definitely say that Chuck has been a major factor in helping me reconnect and communicate with my family. I mean I was close to my family but it wasn’t until we started watching Chuck that I began to appreciate them and who they were as people. 

After my placement (during which, my facilitator commented that my attitude had dramatically improved – though I did not say it was because of a TV show), I spent December watching Chuck and started implementing a lot of the lessons that I had picked up. Not just to take care of my family, but also to take care of myself physically and mentally. I know this sounds really lame but ever since I started watching Chuck, I have started to feel a lot better myself. I've actually taken steps to improve my life and to live it the way I want to live it. I’m putting myself out there; trying out new things and meeting new people. Signed up for a training course next month; gonna catch a plane by myself to see relatives in another state and going to sit my drivers exam to get my license in a couple of weeks. 

Now I’m on Season 5 and just finished ""Chuck versus the Business Trip"". I’m really sad knowing that I am just nine episodes away from the finale and that Chuck’s and Sarah’s adventures are soon coming to an end. But it's a new year and I'm ready to take life and 2013 into my own hands. Chuck really has made my life better and a lot more brighter.

**TL;DR: Chuck has made me laugh, cry and made me want to become a better person.**

I know a lot of you must be thinking ""How am I supposed to live without an episode of Chuck to look forward to every week"" or ""Is there even a point to life any more? What am I supposed to do now?"". And the answer, of course, to both of those questions is:

*WE WATCH IT AGAIN.* ***TOGETHER.***

Every monday, the IRC chat will be open, and it will be most active at 8/7c, when seasons 1 through 4 would have originally aired, but the episode discussion will always be here, so you can watch the episode at your leisure throughout the week.

And of course, we start with the pilot: *Chuck Versus the Intersect.* Where it all began.

I had no idea. Two hours after it ended I am still sobbing. This show has helped to make me into the person I am. Chuck has changed me. It has made me laugh and cry and yell. It has been perfect, even at its worst.

I will never forget watching it for the first time. I joined the party late, halfway through Chuck vs. The Suburbs. Still, I was immediately hooked. I rushed to watch every episode possible. Chuck drew me in. It was mainly the Chuck/Sarah dynamic. To this day, Chuck vs. The Suburbs holds a special place in my heart. The whole show does really.

This show has been there for me. It helped me through tough times and never failed to make me smile. I fell in love with these characters and the stories. Chuck became a part of my life. No show made me happier. No show ever impacted me as much. I have no shame admitting that I have cried like a baby multiple times watching this show. 

What this show meant to me didn't hit until the last 4 minutes of it ever. I began to sob uncontrollable in a combination of happiness and sadness. I feel like I am mourning, but I realize that I am lucky to have just been along for the ride. I will always look back fondly on my experience with Chuck. It will forever be apart of my life. 

Thank you to everyone, to the creators and the actors and the writers. But mainly, thank you to all of you. We fought for this show. We loved this show. Even when we hated plot lines, we supported this show. We rooted for Chuck and Sarah and sang along with Jeffster and grunted with Casey and did the ""Morgan"". It doesn't matter if you have been here since day one or just started watching last week. You were apart of the best thing that has ever happened to television. As sad as it is that Chuck had to end, be happy that we had a chance to watch it at all. A chance to live and love it. And we still do.

Chuck, Sarah, Casey, Ellie, Awesome, Morgan, Alex, Jeff, and Lester will forever live on in our hearts. We will never let go. We went along on the best ride possible. I loved this show every second it was on, and I will never stop.",,False,self,t5_2r4nd,False,,,True,t3_p06b1,http://www.reddit.com/r/chuck/comments/p06b1/i_lost_a_friend_tonight/,

I like to think that the cast and the crew are redditors like ourselves and will see this. My friend first introduced me into Chuck in the Summer last year, I live in England and it wasn't that heard of over here. I checked out the first 4 season and I was hooked, the character development was fantastic and I really grew an attachment for the characters. Some people may say that Chuck &amp; Sarah's love life got a bit stale but I believe you played it off well and many times the show has got me emotionally, a good example is the end of season 4. 

The show really did mean a lot to me, when me and my girlfriend broke up I spent the next few weeks watching this and it helped me take my mind off it, it also helped me get through some really boring shifts at work. The show has been a big part of my life and I have loved every single episode of it.

So, thank you for creating a wonderful show where in a long time I have actually felt something for the characters and cared for them and I am sad there will no longer be anymore Chuck. All of you did a great job on show and I will probably rewatch every episode again. It has been a wonderful 5 seasons.

Hey, So having rewatched the series for a third time I was intrigued especially by S04E09 (Chuck Versus Phase Three) where the Belgian attempts to lobotomize Chuck, essentially removing his memories and personality etc. Just before Sarah Kisses him, the Belgian states that he's gone, meaning Chuck as a person, but the kiss brings him back.

You see where I'm going with this?

Similar Idea with Sarah, all the feels in the finale brought back certain memories, and the kiss would bring her back like it did Chuck. I think the creators, having played so many aspects of previous episodes into later ones, would have considered this and hence hinted that it all works out. Happily ever after with everyone who they once were with their love once again beating the odds.

I want to berieve.

1327821635.0,37,self.chuck,p1hvp,Chuck's Pilot vs. The Finale -- some thoughts from a day one fan.,Teotwawki69,42,5,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/chuck/comments/p1hvp/chucks_pilot_vs_the_finale_some_thoughts_from_a/,"A little disclosure here – I’ve spent time in the trenches of TV, behind the scenes, on camera, and writing, so I know how TV works. One great lesson I learned from an excellent executive producer who was wrapping up a series was this: To write the finale, you go back to the pilot. I just re-watched *Chuck vs. the Pilot*, and it made the series finale even more amazing, because they did go back and, in effect, everything set up in that first episode was paid off in the last.

Just a few striking things. Finale: In the DARPA sequence, when Sarah kicks her way in through a window and takes out the guards, including sliding under a table and kicking out chairs, it is almost a shot-for-shot remake of Bryce Larkin’s original escape from DARPA. Additionally, the bomb she plants outside of the Intersect room is the same bomb that Larkin plants inside the room, and the way it looks after destruction is pretty much identical. (Indeed, it looks like the intersect room was even shot on the same location, except that the walls, floor, and ceiling did not light up with images.) In the aftermath, we meet Graham, from the CIA, and a character who must be the general but who is not played by Bonita Friedericy, although she has the same distinctive uniform and big red “hairdryer” hairdo. Possible discontinuity note: the Intersect Room Bryce breaks into is in Washington DC, but it, and the hallway outside, are identical to the Intersect Room Chuck and company break into in the finale but which is in Los Angeles. However, it just may be that DARPA had their facility recreated in LA five years later, built on the same plan. To paraphrase Jon Hurt in *Contact*, never build anything at government expense when you can build two at twice the cost.

The relationship between Chuck and Sarah in the Pilot also echoes their relationship in the finale. She is pretending to be interested in him at first, in order to find out whether he’s backed up the intersect data Bryce sent him. Also, she breaks into his apartment to steal his computer, although she’s in disguise – in effect, the equivalent of her orders from Quinn in the first half of the finale to kill him. To top that off, she is given orders to kill Chuck if necessary in her downtown apartment, just before she opens the green door to greet him before their first “date” – an identical shot, and in the same location, to the one just before she wakes up after losing her memory to open the door to Quinn in the set-up to the first half of the finale.

Sarah’s arc in the pilot is to go from emotionless agent sent out to deal with collateral damage any way possible but, by the end of the pilot, it’s clear that she feels protective of Chuck, and this brings up a really nice irony. The big issue we begin with (it’s the opening shot) is Chuck and Morgan trying to ditch Chuck’s own birthday party (so the character’s canonical birthday is September 24) because Ellie has taken it as an opportunity to invite all of her women doctor friends, in order to fix Chuck up with someone. However, it becomes clear that Chuck doesn’t know how to talk to women, and winds up driving them away. Although Sarah is far hotter and younger than any of the women at his party, he has no problem talking to her, but he doesn’t realize it. From our point of view, he actually does win her over a little bit in the pilot. However, he doesn’t realize this once he finds out that she’s CIA, so his position regarding Sarah at the end of the pilot is 180 degrees from his attitude toward her at the end of the series.

Now, here’s the real heart-jerker twist. Near the end of the pilot, Sarah finds Chuck sitting alone on the beach (yes, the same beach), and it’s an emotional reversal of their last conversation in the finale. Sarah tries to convince Chuck that he has to trust her, but he’s not ready for that yet. 

The other notable bits from the pilot are how much the other characters have changed. From the beginning, we really don’t like Casey, first because he “kills” Bryce Larkin, and second his mission is to bring in Chuck (even if it means locking him in solitary forever) and to kill Sarah, although he winds up letting Sarah live and working undercover at the Buy More at the end of the pilot. Morgan is super-creepy -- this is when he had a major crush on Ellie, and he even takes his bromance with Chuck a little bit too far a couple of times. Ellie is way too possessive of Chuck (the big lesson she learns in the series is letting go) and Devon “Captain Awesome” Holcombe is still just a cardboard pretty-boy stereotype. Big Mike has only one wordless scene, and hasn’t evolved into a likeable character yet, and we have two blasts from the past – Lester’s love-interest Anna, and Chuck’s Buy More nemesis, Harry Tang. Subtle foreshadow: Chuck and Ellie refer to “Aces” as an expression their Dad used, and that comes back big time once Scott Bakula/Orion appears.

So… after watching the pilot again, what do I think? Yeah… I would have watched this series again. And I’m even more convinced that it ended on exactly the right note.

TL;DR: Watched pilot right after finale. Everything from the ending was there from the beginning. Everything that happened was always all about the characters.",,False,self,t5_2r4nd,False,,,True,t3_p1hvp,http://www.reddit.com/r/chuck/comments/p1hvp/chucks_pilot_vs_the_finale_some_thoughts_from_a/,

I bought the bluray the day it came out but couldn't bring myself to watch it. I finally watched the season this weekend and realized that Morgan's magical kiss theory was right.

Maybe I am crazy but I believe that when they kissed on the beach her memories came back, maybe not the specific memories but memory of her feelings for chuck and that moment she fell in love with him again. 

The reason why I believe this are because of what happened with Morgan. At the beginning of the season as you all know Morgan had the intersect and because of it started losing his memories and losing who it was. During this process Sarah and Ellie didn't believe that Morgan had changed but there was something wrong with him. When it became apparent what was wrong Ellie kept stressing that a strong emotional stimulus may trigger the real Morgan that was inside the douchey exterior. Eventually it did the story of Moran getting pantsed and how they got back at the girl that did it got Morgan back.

Sarah however was further lost than morgan, Sarah was forced to flash over and over again to the point where she forgot her past five years or so. However the extended edition made it clear that Ellie, Morgan, and Awesome had not given up on this theory. In the extended edition they had attempted the video montage, however that was not enough. Morgan and the factors surrounding the last mission stressed this as well, Morgan telling chuck to make this the most romantic mission ever, telling chuck to keep telling their story to her, the fact that every place they went (the restaurant, the consulate dinner, the wienerlicious, the concert hall) were all places that held strong emotions for chuck and sarah.

These places didn't bring sarah but clearly those emotional stimuli were getting through to her. She was remembering small things and potentially remember emotions. Several of the parts that were cut from the final episode were just transitions in a lot of these transitions you have chuck tell sarah an emotional story or tell her something about himself and has sarah is walking away you see her smirk. They are one of those smirks that you saw through the first few seasons where you knew sarah was falling for chuck. These deleted transitions made it seem to me that Sarah was coming back however the emotional stimuli were not strong enough. Even when she is leaving castle and chuck was about to tell her Morgan's kiss the girl theory, I feel like there was a little disappointment in her when he stopped and let her go, i see it in her face when they do the slow mo of her walking out.

This takes us to the final scene on the beach, in a place that ""she knew was important for some reason,"" she finally lets chuck tell her their story. The story of how they fell in love, the story we all love. Then at the end of it when Chuck finally tells her Morgan's theory she wants him to kiss her. She might not be fully sarah then but there is clearly something inside her that knows she is meant to be with chuck. 

Finally there is the kiss, chuck kisses her passionately. I can't think of a stronger emotional stimuli then a kiss, and as Sarah kissed chuck back and the kiss went on I knew that Sarah was in love with chuck again. That kiss that emotional reaction in her made her like Morgan at the beginning of the season. Morgan's memories never came back but he regained who he was; Sarah's memories may have not come back, but Sarah regained who she was, who she evolved into throughout the series. We did get that happy ending we all wanted for chuck. 

Plus Morgan,the guy who was a moron and an idiot (but still awesome) throughout the series was right about everything else in the episode. He was right that Chuck would find Sarah. He was right about telling Casey that he was worried he was at his best with the team. He came up with the Jeffster plan that stopped the bomb from exploding. Why the hell would they make him wrong about the magical kiss.

He seems to agree on most of our thoughts on Sarah and chuck getting back together (if not her memory coming back).

More importantly, I wouldn't be completely opposed to a kickstarter campaign for a Chuck movie. If Double Fine can raise $2Million USDollars in two weeks, why can't we as Chuck fans do the same and better? Obviously Zach is behind the idea, and I'm sure he can Charles Carmichael charm his way into convincing the rest of the cast and crew!

""Fedak: You know, part of me feels it's very much dependent on the person who's watching the scene. I think it's a happy ending and I think that Sarah's memories… We've kind of implied throughout the episode that Sarah's memories are there and that she is slowly but surely recovering them. But we also didn't want to paint a picture of her immediately remembering everything. So I think that we loved the notion of Sarah and Chuck falling in love again – getting to experience those first moments one more time. We thought that was an amazing way to leave them. So I think that unlike that kind of moment where a person just remembers everything in their life – that wasn't exactly what we wanted to do there.""

Wanted to share some thoughts.,samo21,28,0,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/chuck/comments/rqsbt/just_finished_the_series_last_night_wanted_to/,"A. I thought the entire last 6 or 7 episodes was amazing. I felt some of the plot lines were rushed and could have lasted much longer, but I realize they had meaty stories to tell with very few episodes available. I feel like even though there were slow episodes in the middle seasons, this final season really bought out the best of everything that made Chuck great from Season 1. And the last few episodes really were designed to bring us back.

B. I thought Zachary Levi's acting in particular was amazing in the last couple episodes. The scene where he was begging Sarah to remember in their dream home had me shedding (manly) tears. 

C. The idea of Sarah falling in love with Chuck all over again, and them rebuilding their life together makes me feel all mushy inside. Perfect way to end the series, leaving the viewer imagining how they move forward.

D. Something that struck me is just how well the last couple episodes highlighted Chuck's growth as a person. Chuck from Season 1,2, and probably 3, would have just given up on life when Sarah lost her memory and tried to kill him. But when he was begging Sarah to remember, he didn't say something like ""You might as well just shoot me"" or anything like that, he said ""You'll never see me again."" Basically it just highlighted to me how much he's grown up over the past 5 years as a character. 

E. Somewhat related to the last point, the fact that series is now over really makes me feel like I've lost something meaningful. Chuck started when I was about 17 and just started college, and now I've graduated... and I guess I feel like Chuck and I grew up together. That sounds kinda dumb typing it out, but, still seems to have some truth to it.

That's all I've got for now. Thanks for reading, if you read :)",,False,self,t5_2r4nd,False,,,True,t3_rqsbt,http://www.reddit.com/r/chuck/comments/rqsbt/just_finished_the_series_last_night_wanted_to/,

Don't read on if you haven't finished the series!*

So, while I've wanted to grasp onto the idea that Sarah gets her memory back after the finale, one of the things that has really, really bugged me about it is the fact that Morgan never got his any of his memory back - to the point that he had to rewatch such classic movies as Star Wars. So, then... Why would Sarah's magically start coming back?

However, I realized that in the last episode (second to last one? I don't know, I just group them together), when the quartet is at the DARPA facility, Morgan goes and starts playing with the Invisibility Cloak. When he does so, though, he makes direct references to both Harry Potter (""You're a wizard, Harry"") and The Fugitive (""It was the one-armed man!""). And, while it's possible that he had already watched these movies again, I somewhat doubt that Chuck would put The Fugitive, as great of a movie as it is, near the top of Morgan's rewatch list, which means that he would have somehow had to remember the movie from before.

So that's, while circumstantial, is another piece of evidence that supports Sarah getting her memory back after the finale. Just my two cents worth.",,False,self,t5_2r4nd,False,,,True,t3_pxvtb,http://www.reddit.com/r/chuck/comments/pxvtb/another_tidbit_that_convinces_me_that_everything/,

Would have seasons 3 and 4 had better ratings if the first two seasons were on Netflix to get viewers hooked?

1373392088.0,26,self.chuck,1hy4xk,A leap of faith.,heymrk,29,3,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/chuck/comments/1hy4xk/a_leap_of_faith/,"I often see the ending of Chuck as a point of contention among fans. As a society, we're conditioned to certain tropes: the good guy gets the girl, the hero is hailed upon his homecoming, they all lived happily ever after.

Before we get started, for those of you who don't know the word, according to Merriam Webster, a *trope* is a common or overused theme or device, or a word or expression used in a figurative sense. There's a third, archaic definition which has nothing to do with what I'm trying to say.

But what if those tropes are challenged? Most people tend to rebel because the simple idea of contradicting a trope attacks the basis of human storytelling-- that fantasy is preferable to real life, and *always* has a happy ending. This storytelling that has been around since the Homeric hymns. Odysseus went through hell (literally), but he made it home. In the end, he paid penance to Poseidon for his attitude, but he still made it home.

So I look at the ending of Chuck as one of those attacks on a trope. But I see beauty in it. I see possibility.

It makes me look back to another series-- a series that Chuck is, *in essence,* a spiritual successor to. That show is Quantum Leap.

I knew the outcome, but I never actually saw the final episode of Quantum Leap until recently. If you don't know, don't read on.

Sam never gets home.

This final episode is beautiful. It's even more beautiful to me than the ending of Chuck. Not just because both series attack social tropes, but because of the deep-rooted symbolism behind what they were trying to say to us.

Both shows aired on NBC. Both shows had the captain of the Enterprise. Less known, they both stayed on the air due to letter writing campaigns and a staunch, loyal fanbase that refused to give up on shows they truly believed in.

Now, season five of Quantum Leap did some silly things, like confirm the existence of aliens, vampires, the devil and Bigfoot, along with exploring conspiracy theories about the Kennedy assassination (and ruin the show's theme with a terrible remix), but was overall, a very solid show. Then the two shows have such a similar, trope-defying ending. It makes me shiver how history can repeat itself so beautifully.

So let's talk about the way Quantum Leap ended.

Sam spends the episode in a bar outside of Pennsylvania, on the day of his birth, confronted with pastiches from his own life, both prior to and during the Quantum Leap project. At the end, he returns to a singular moment at the end of the second season and makes a decision.

To go back from that, early in the first season of the show, Sam leaps into an understudy in a production of *Man of La Mancha*, the stage performance of Don Quixote. During that leap, he ran into his own piano teacher. His first crush. A woman who was too old for him. But when he leaped into the performer, they were age appropriate for each other.

Al warned Sam that he was breaking one of his own rules about time travel-- *never do anything to improve your own situation.*

He slept with the woman anyway.

It wasn't the only time he acted in his own interests. He saved his brother's life in Vietnam. There were other incidents I'm not able to remember at the moment.

But the one time Al needed him-- *truly needed him*-- Sam stood fast to his rules. While Al was in Vietnam, he was taken hostage and kept in a tiger cage for four years. Al's first wife Beth had him declared dead and she remarried. Al went through four other marriages-- none of them happy. Al even told Dr. Ruth Westheimer that he only loved one woman-- Beth.

Al stood by Sam time and time again, protecting him, keeping him grounded and providing him with the knowledge to complete each leap. That one singular moment made Sam a bad friend to Al that would define the rest of the show. Sure, there were other moments where Sam didn't do what Al felt was right, but this was the big one. Throughout the entire series, the relationship was all take from Sam, and the moment Al needed Sam, that same capacity to give was nowhere to be found.

That isn't to say Sam is a bad person-- not by a long shot. As established by the last episode, Sam wouldn't keep leaping unless he wanted to stop. He was simply a better friend to strangers than to his best friend.

When Sam realizes he can leap where he wants, he remembers the leap with Beth and returns there to tell her to wait on Al. He will come home from Vietnam.

In that moment, Sam changes Al's entire history and becomes lost to time-- *forever.* Unable to return home because Al was never with the Quantum Leap project to watch over him. Now, whether every life he changed was reverted is unknown, but he made his mistake up to Al.

Al is Sancho Panza to Sam's Don Quixote. In the story, the lord of La Mancha isn't as crazy as those who gloss over literature claim him to be. He's simply holding onto ideals that had gone out of style. While he did, indeed, think the windmills were dragons, the goal was to retain nobility in a world that considered it outdated.

Sancho Panza stood by his lord's side, knowing society's values had changed, and embracing those cultural changes, but stuck to him anyway because it was both his job and the right thing to do. Panza did everything asked of him by Don Quixote and asked nothing in return.

There is a moment in the third season where Al leaps and Sam ends up in the imaging chamber, which is a nice foretelling of the final episode, where Sam re-enters the Quantum Accelerator, knowing full well he could end up back in the same situation as before. He takes the risk to save Al's life, but justifies it for the sake of completing the mission. It's an important growth moment for Sam, because he's changing his relationship with Al. If I'm not mistaken, this is the episode where Sam admits that Al is his best friend.

Quantum Leap teaches us that friendship is everything. You can make the world as good a place as you want, but those who are closest to you deserve your consideration, as well.

This is the thing about Chuck. The ending to this show frustrated fans because it was unclear if Sarah got her memory back through some reverse Superman II-type kiss. Whether she did or not is irrelevant to the situation. What doesn't change is the journey there.

In the final scene of Quantum Leap, the music-- Ray Charles' *Georgia on My Mind*-- fits the scene perfectly for both Al and Sam alike. For Sam, because he never gets to go home, even though it always stayed on his mind. But for Al, because he does get to go home-- he does get Beth. And if you think about it, there is a happy ending for Quantum Leap. But it isn't Sam's. It's Al's.

So in Chuck, The Head and The Heart's *Rivers and Roads* is also apropos to the scene. It's their journey. Whether Sarah gets her memory back or not, she's still with Chuck. The montage where Chuck tells her their stories reinforces this with the way they both laugh about the things they'd been through.

Prior to meeting Sarah, there was a life that Chuck was never going to be privy to. Things she would never be able to tell him. I, personally, believe that she never regains her memory (after all, Morgan didn't). By losing her memory, it created the start of a new journey *where she could be completely his* and *without the baggage and secrets of the spy game.* They could start fresh. That's their journey. That's their river and road. Their love is stronger than memories in *the head,* but in *the heart.*

Unlike Quantum Leap, Chuck and Sarah's goal isn't to get home. They already are home. The goal is to be together, with nothing standing in their way or holding them back.

If you're going to challenge a trope, these two shows, with so unbelievably much in common, did so *incredibly* well.",,False,self,t5_2r4nd,False,,,True,t3_1hy4xk,http://www.reddit.com/r/chuck/comments/1hy4xk/a_leap_of_faith/,

I concur with everyone's statements on that.

Chuck was great for a number of reasons...the humor, the cast, the will-they-or-won't-they of Chuck and Sarah, the missions, the one-liners, Jeffster, the buy more, Subway, the music, and all the smiles it gave us and tears it made us cry over the past five years.  

But what I really felt myself latching onto was the portrayal of family, of love, and of community.  It seems like shows these days mostly paint their main characters as flawed, and we as the audience root for them to get over their flaws.  But Chuck, his family, his wife, and his friends were all so archetypal.  They bond they shared with each other was stronger than any bond, real or dramatized, that I have ever seen.  They lived for each others' safety, well-being, and happiness.  I'd be hard pressed to find anyone who has ever experienced a community as selfless and as others-focused as the Bartowskis.

So, it's been a good run for five years.  But I hope all of us can take THIS part of it with us, whether we recognize it or not.  Let's make our communities better.  Let's be more fervent in the way we give to others, more passionate in our service to those in need, or those we just call friends.  I hope we can create a world where this kind of love isn't just an exception, but it is the rule.

""This was just a TV show,"" I'm reminded by several of my non-Chuck watching friends, and they're right to a point.  But television is art, and art is an imitation of life.  Somewhere, someone who wrote this show, who directed it, who acted in it, who created it, believed that this kind of world was possible, or at least good enough that we should dream about it.

On the one hand, I'm glad that he's showing problems with the Intersect. It agrees with pre-existing show canon (he's not special like Chuck, and hasn't been trained like the Gretas), and I'm sure that if he didn't have any problems at all, a lot of you would be saying ""WTF, I thought Chuck was supposed to be special, and now Morgan handles it no problem?"" 

On the other, rather large, hand: He. Is. Such. A. **TWAT**. The only time Morgan was ever remotely this annoying was when he was still after Ellie and was completely out of the spy loop. And one thing I was wondering, why didn't Chuck at any point say to him ""Dude, I was told to stay in the car for **2 whole years**.""?

Other things:

* Hey, it's Green Arrow!

* I'm 90% certain that I'm going to only refer to Verbanski as Trinity.

* Really, you make your Luke Skywalker joke the episode *after* Mark Hamill?

* Casey pussying out on the phone gave me a good chuckle. Actually, most of the humor in this episode was Casey, imo.

* If Captain Awesome and The Buy More Crew get a couple more team-ups before it's all said and done, that would be pretty cool. Awesome and Big Mike are my two favorite secondary characters.

* I was shocked when I heard Lester say he was over Jeffster! And I know some of you may disagree, but I think we need one more Jeffster! before Chuck comes to a close. Just one more! Just one more! Just one more!

Anyways… thoughts? Anything I missed discussion-wise?

Although my Chuck knowledge and English is a bit rusty I'll try not to make any huge mistakes.
_________________________


As we all know, what made this show great was the character development, never have I been more emotionally invested in some fictional TV-characters.
The story wasn't always what it could be, but we all stuck around just to see Chuck and Sarah live happily ever after. (Yes, this show made me feel like a 12 year old girl)
So let's analyze the show through the character development:

***(TL;DR) It's longer than I expected. If you want to get to the good stuff immediately I'd suggest to start reading at Ellie or Sarah.***

**Chuck**:

* MISSION: Get his life back on track, become a man, get the girl
* REPORT: As Chuck tries to get his *shit* together, it becomes apparent he needs Sarah to do so (see cheesy puffs). All other love interests only bring bad news.
Chucks character development comes to an end at the end of season 4: he doesn't have the intersect but he got the girl (married Sarah), he became a better version of himself.
* CRITIQUE: If the show ended on season 4, Chucks character development would have been complete. However, the show ended with Chuck having to win her over again, we can speculate 
on what happens next, but the visible fact is that chucks mission is incomplete again.


**Morgan**:

* MISSION: Grow up, get a girl
* REPORT: Morgan leaves his toys behind, moves out of Chucks place and gets close with Caseys daughter. Their relationship becomes more serious through season 4, at the end of season 5 Casey has finally fully accepted that fact and offers them his house when they decide to live together.
* CRITIQUE: None, Morgans mission is complete by the end of season 5.


**Casey**:

* MISSION: Learn to love again
* REPORT: Casey struggles with the concept of love and care, until we find out about his daughter, this is when the focus shifts to his character development more. He is understanding of Chuck and Sarahs relationship, he slowly befriends Morgan/allows him to date his daughter and we find out about his love interest - Gertrude Vebanski.
* CRITIQUE: None, at the end of season 5 he tries to help Chuck win back Sarah (Sarahs mission logs), he even gives Chuck a hug before leaving for Dresden, to go find Gertrude.

**Awesome**:

* MISSION: Be awesome
* REPORT: Is awesome
* CRITIQUE: none


**Ellie**:

* MISSION: Let go of Chuck
* REPORT: Once she and Devon get married they decide to move out, leaving Chuck with his own place, although they still live nearby. Eventually they get offered better jobs and move out completely.
* CRITIQUE: None, at the end of season 5 they say their goodbyes and go their own way.

* *SIDE QUEST*: Become Orion 2.0
* *SIDE QUEST REPORT*: In season 4 Ellie's main focus is on Her dads (Orion) laptop after she finds it analyzing some clues her dad left her in the newspaper. Even the NSA director shows interest in Ellie, as she is the only one who could make sense of her fathers work. At this point it seems obvious Ellie is being prepped to become the new Orion.
* *SIDE QUEST CRITIQUE*: In season 5 this part of Ellie's life comes to an abrupt, unexplained halt. The only use her knowledge has in season 5 is understanding how the corrupt intersect deletes memories (something Morgan had actually figured out). Ellie does not become Orion 2.0, this would've been fine for her major character development (Ellie doesn't want anything to do with the spylife), but they made it a huge item in season 4, so it seemed way more important.



**Sarah**:

* MISSION: Learn to love, trust again, get the guy
* REPORT: Of all people, Sarah was the one who struggled the most in her character development. Her father taught her to never trust anyone, the CIA taught her to never fall in 
love, at least not with the mission subject.  Before season 3 we didn't know that much about her: We know she's one of the best spies, she was romantically involved with Bryce, we know who her father is,..


* Weird to say but we know almost nothing about this main protagonist. 
With the end of season 4 nearing, Chucks character development is coming to an end, so this is when attention shifts almost completely to Sarah.
We finally get to see the world through Sarahs eyes.
Her character development reaches a peak when we learn about her mother and the baby in season 5.
* CRITIQUE: If the show ended on Season 4, Sarahs mission would be complete, however we'd still not know everything about her, but this isn't needed at the time, season 5 created that need. Now this is where stuff goes horribly wrong. The writers just made us feel closer to Sarah, we felt way closer to her then we ever did (the house, suggestion of children and their names, her mother &amp; the baby) and then they decided to throw away that special connection. It was a genius but devastating move from the writers: they gave us a unique, beautiful ending. They knew that this was how they could make us remember Chuck for the rest of our lives. Look at me it's been half a year since I saw the last episode and here I am writing this huge text completely on my own will. If they went ahead and gave us the ending we all wanted, yes we'd love it but, we'd just move on to the next TV show and forget about Chuck. It's a cruel thing to do, but it's genius, from a marketing standpoint, they left us wanting more, this is how you keep a fanbase alive. This is why people want a Chuck movie to happen, or even season 6 because honestly, if you look at the facts -- Chuck isn't over, they ended season 5 with a new MISSION: getting Sarah back (again). 

_______________________________
**Final thoughts** -- *My Opinion*:

Season 5 was not a bad season, there were many great episodes and the season finale was beautiful. It was however not worthy for a *Series* Finale, the way they introduced and handled Quinn as the new main bad guy was crap. 

You can't blame it on NBC this time, Chuck was given another season and they knew it was going to be the last one.

Because of all this, they could easily pick up where they left off, like I said, the writers made the story incomplete. They even went as far as hinting to a follow-up by giving General Beckman the following line: 
&gt;""*dramatic pause*  - If you ever want to save the world again, you know where I am.""

I'm not posting this to make you hope for a Chuck follow-up - if it happens, it happens.
If you want to make it happen, buy the DVDs, merchandise or (re)watch Chuck on Netflix. If Warner Brothers sees the fanbase is still there and is expanding, something could happen, just give it some time, nothing good ever comes from rushing things, how badly we want it or not, we don't want to see Chuck go full retard. 

Like Zach said, and I paraphrase: the power is in the hands of the people now, they decide what they want to pay for and they will fund that which they deem worthy of their money.",,False,self,t5_2r4nd,False,,,True,t3_1fhflg,http://www.reddit.com/r/chuck/comments/1fhflg/what_the_hell_was_the_point_of_season_5_comment/,

I'm gonna try to list all geek references in every week's episodes. So this one didnt had that much but some interesting cameos though

(http://i.imgur.com/IOcemh.jpg) of course is the most obvious, playing the part of Gertrude Verbanski is [Carrie-Anne Moss](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005251/) of Matrix fame.

(http://i.imgur.com/Muhojh.jpg), playing Karl Sneijder is one of my favorite actor, [Jeff Fahey](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001194/)
, many might know him from Lost (He played Frank Lapidus) but I loved him on Planet Terror (Best BBQ in Texas ^^ ) and Machete.

Playing Wesley (http://i.imgur.com/bCFbhh.jpg) is [Justin Hartley](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1261997/), apparently a Smallville regular, I never watched Smallville after the second season so I dont really know him but apparently he played a non bearded Green Arrow (blasphemy xD)

We can see Morgan (http://i.imgur.com/Ffcs7h.jpg) reading Eric Powell's [The Goon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Goon), a very awesome and insane comic book. On the van is also the [""International Spy Museum Handbook of Practical Spying""](http://www.amazon.com/International-Museums-Handbook-Practical-Spying/dp/0792267958), by Jack Barth

In Morgan and Casey's appartment (http://i.imgur.com/Hpn61h.jpg) can be found the comic book [""Millenium""](http://www.amazon.com/Millennium-Steve-Englehart/dp/1401220657/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1320541799&amp;sr=1-1) , a DC Comic TPB.

I couldnt identify [this one though](http://i.imgur.com/E4JTZh.jpg), if you have any idea please let me know, I was thinking of Marvel Zombies but I dont think it's that.

Conversations included references to Batman and Robin (or more likely ""Batman and Batman""), Indiana Jones, Star Wars and Die Hard for the Trilogy night (I like how chuck continues to call them just trilogies ^^), and of course the Luke Skywalker speech, with the cliffhanger resulting...

Did I missed anything ??

I'm sort of okay with how open the ending was. Not the biggest fan of it but I get the appeal..it's different. That's not what bugs me. What pisses me of is that after five amazing seasons of character development, they screw it all up with a villan (Quinn) who was introduced one episode earlier. He had no real reason to take Sarah's memories away. Just to turn her? He couldn't have used any other CIA agent? I would kind of understand if Shaw wanted her back, so he escapes from prison and resets her memories but even then...fucking Quinn.

Also he was killed outside the lab that brought Shaw back to life so they could have used that same lab equipment to bring Orion back.

the way it's shot and edited seems like it pulls you into the show more effectively. the way the characters interact with each other is more natural, it's really what draws me to this show. 

the current seasons are still good, but i wish they had kept the same style as the first. was there any creative staff changes between the first and fifth season? i'm thinking it's probably network intervention that changed it all

1330540448.0,17,self.chuck,qbmsu,Chuck Movie Self Written Plots,Boltftw,20,3,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/chuck/comments/qbmsu/chuck_movie_self_written_plots/,"I know it is been a little over a month since the series finale aired and some of us have had the opportunity to rewatch the entire series again. I just want to know If or if there is not a Chuck movie coming out how would you write the plot and what characters would you use? 

I have been thinking about this ever since the possibility of a movie happening and I think if I were to write the plot I would use where the series finale left off, probably a year or two later though. I think I would begin with the traditional fill everyone in on what happened since last time and I would slowly start filling in gaps on how Sarah started to regain her memories. With the help of her friends, family and Chuck. Sarah is starting to resemble what we saw of her in season 4-5 where she has found that love for Chuck again. Clearly, I would use a sort of flash back where words said or certain places make her flash to that part of her memory. This would make for a good time to relive the moments all Chuck fans love and hated, but would also serve as a gap filler for all the new viewers of Chuck. These flash backs would also be a part of how Sarah questions her time with Agent Cole, Agent Shaw, Fulcrum, The Ring and Volkoff.

During all of this Morgan is thinking of proposing to Alex, but can not do it until he finds the location of Casey and Gertrude. Awesome and Ellie are living a happy life in Chicago. Ellie has dropped the entire intersect project because of the advice received from Chuck. Chuck would say ""Ellie, the intersect has been a curse to this family and we need to just forget about it.""

Everything is happy and everyone would be brought up to speed at this point besides having the known location of Agent Casey. Chuck, Sarah and Morgan are running Carmicheal Industries and Sarah and Chuck have been doing side jobs for General Beckman. One day General Beckman calls the team up and tells them they need to track down Agent Casey because she needs the entire team back together, Agent Shaw has escaped. This is when Sarah is confused because all she remembers from her past life with Shaw was that she used to be in a relationship with him and that she killed his wife. 

Agent Shaw is now on the run and planning something big. He still wants his revenge but more on a global scale, he is seen purchasing a ticket to Chicago. Chuck, Sarah and Morgan find Casey in the jungles of Thailand, where Sarah had the badass fight scenes in the pit. They inform Casey about how Agent Shaw is on the loose and they need him back. He just replies with a grunt and joins them. Back at Burbank, Beckman informs that security cameras saw Shaw traveling to Chicago. Chuck realized that his sister is there and they need to go there asap. During there travels to Chicago, Morgan will ask Casey if he could marry his daughter. Casey just gives him the cop face. Chuck calls Awesome and tells him not to freak out, but Agent Shaw has escaped. Awesome of course freaks out and is not Awesome. When Chuck arrives at Ellies house, she quickly realizes something is not right and immediately interrogates Chuck. Chuck tells her not to freak out but he believes Shaw is somewhere in Chicago. Chuck then says ""Ellie we have to go where are Devon and Claira?"". Ellie replies with a ""They are running errands"" The house they live in blows up when they are leaving and Shaw is standing from a distance staring. 

Everyone is now heading back to Burbank to report back to Beckman on what happened, the government has informed the hospital that Ellie is needed to do some research for them along with Devon and will not be returning anytime soon. As Team Bartowski heads out to familiar locations, Sarah beings to have a series of flashes that being to fill in gaps of when Chuck left her to become a spy and this has a major influence on her because she is now confused and does not have the courage to ask him about it. Mixed feelings and all, they gather intel the Agent Shaw is in a underground old Ring base where he was resurrected and received the intersect. (This did not get blown up, at least to my knowledge). Shaw runs the intersect program version 3.0 again knowing that there were bugs in it, but does not care because he wants to destroy Sarah and Chuck.

During Team Bartowskis mission it is revealed the General Beckman has been working with Ellie on the intersect program, even though Chuck told her not too. Ellie has for the most part a working intersect 4.0, that can be used to restore Sarah's memories or remove the intersect in Chuck's head. Big fight scene between Chuck and Shaw, Morgan proposes to Alex after the fight scene and Chuck being the hospital (Think of Sarah and Chucks proposal scene). Chuck wakes up finds out Ellie has a new intersect, Shaw is officially dead and he has to decide on either removing the intersect out of his head, or restoring Sarah's memories. Chuck being Chuck he just steps on the glasses and tells Sarah that even though some of her memories are gone, he and her have made new ones to replace those old ones and will (remember his vows) everyday prove to her that he loves her. They kiss, and flash forward to 6 months. Morgan and Alex have there wedding, Awesome and Ellie move back to Burbank, Casey is thinking of proposing to Gertrude, and finally Chuck and Sarah are happy together out of the spy life and in there dream home (thanks to General Beckman and her generous gift). The last scene will be a prego stick that has a a plus sign or whatever to tell the audience that a little Charah is on the way.

I would also like to add that there will be cameos of Sarah's mom, dad, and sister, Jeffster, Big Mike and the Buy More. I just don't know how I would write them in. ",,False,self,t5_2r4nd,False,,,True,t3_qbmsu,http://www.reddit.com/r/chuck/comments/qbmsu/chuck_movie_self_written_plots/,

I'll provide a few ideas to get things started, but I need your help to add more... :)

**WARNING:**  This is just for fun, know when to say when.  This game is not to be played by minors who are not legally allowed to drink.  If you have an alcohol problem, please seek help.

**SIP A BEER WHEN:**

- Chuck is told to stay in the car

- Casey grunts

- Lock and load montage

- Jeff, Lester and/or Morgan does something creepy/weird

- Ellie expresses concern about Chuck

- Someone mentions Fulcrum or The Ring

- Buy More suffers collateral damage.  (credit to demented_pants)

- The courtyard outside Chuck's apartment is shown.

- A kiss happens.

**TAKE A SHOT WHEN:**

- Sarah uses a weapon other than a gun

- Cat fight

- Chuck actually obeys Sarah, Casey, Beckman, etc and STILL gets into trouble...

- Casey interacts with his Reagan photo (credit to demented_pants)

- Captain Awesome says that something is ""Awesome"".

- Jeff drinks

- A love interest shows up for anybody

- For the first flash of a character in an episode (Sip a beer for every subsequent flash)

- Subway is mentioned

- A recurring guest character shows up. (Carina, Bryce, Roan, Shaw, Jill, Orion, Ted Roark, Mary, The Awesomes, etc.)

- A guest character played by a celebrity (Half-shot if said celebrity plays a recurring character.  Otherwise, Season 3 will F*** YOU UP.)

- If said celebrity references a previous role, take another shot (""Come with me if you want to live"", ""I must break you"", Casey referencing Firefly that one time counts too..., Do the mannerisms of the Old Spice Guy [Greta #2] count as a reference?)

- Chuck says ""Waitwaitwaitwaitwait"" (credit to luke727)

- Chuck says ""Hoooh Hoooh Hoooh...""

- An operative of The Ring/Fulcrum/Volkoff shows up (Exception being ""Chuck vs. The Suburbs"".  Don't drink for this one.  I mean, between Andy Richter and Jenny McCarthy both being in this, you're probably already fucked up...""

- Chuck and/or Morgan talk about something from ""Nerd/Geek Culture"" (Star Wars, video games, Tron poster etc.)

**FINISH YOUR DRINK WHEN:**

- Chuck and Sarah go through their whole ""I love you, but I can't be with you"" drama

- Someone other than Chuck, Sarah or Casey saves the day (i.e. Big Mike, Jeffster, Awesome)

- A major character or recurring villain dies (""fake deaths"" count too.  i.e. Bryce Larkin in the Pilot) 

- Said character comes back from the dead (credit to demented_pants)",,False,self,t5_2r4nd,True,,,True,t3_p3hl0,http://www.reddit.com/r/chuck/comments/p3hl0/chuck_the_drinking_game_or_chuck_vs_alcohol/,

Ok, maybe it was a bit too happy and too cheesy but let's take a look at the state of the series at the end of season 4:

* Sara and Chuck storyline is at an end: They are in love, they are married and they are planning a future together. Recieving the Volkoff money there's a hint on what their future will look like but without saying too much. Perfect for fanfic to keep the universe alive even after the series has ended.

* The Volkoff storyline has ended (obviously)
* The Chuck's parents storyline has ended: Chuck knows about his parents and the fact that his mother is at the wedding kind of finalizes that everything is ""okay"" now.
* The wedding was the finale we all had hoped for, it was an insanely well produced episode that brought everything to the table that Chuck stands for: Action, Comedy and romance. I was excited, I was laughing, I was crying. Everything was perfect.

Then Morgan picks up the intersect and everything goes to shit.

Season 5: 

* Since every storyline was closed new ones are introduced. This leads to the writers having to just ""make something up"": Everything that is being done is irrelevant to previous seasons and since Season 5 was always to be a last season they don't have the depth either. In the end we have a very anti-climatic stand-off between Quinn and Chuck that feels rushed and forced. Did I mention it feels like Chuck actually loses to him in the end?
* Talking about the ending: By taking away Sarah's memories the whole series just loses a big part of it's strengths: Chracter development. In a lot of series we have characters basically moving on the spot, like in childrens' TV in which the characters are having adventure after adventure without their basic situation ever changing. It leaves us with a sour taste. In my opinion Chuck as a series always conveyed a certain ""Even your average loser guy can be destined for great things""-feeling. They solidified this with the wedding (""the nerd getting the girl""). Chuck was a hero and he was rewarded for it. This last scene is just so much against everything that Chuck ever stood for: Being the hero and being rewarded for it. Chuck has to decide between the love of his life (it is fairly obvious that he will never again love a girl like he loves Sarah) and being the hero (disarming the bomb). He chooses being the hero and recieves the full punishment for it. How evermuch it may be possible that Sarah recovers her memory - it certainly seems unlikely.
* The morgan storyline. I mean come on, wtf? Chuck was a hero you could identify with and Morgan was his funny little sidekick with the heart made of gold. Season 5 turns him into a ""hero"" and then makes him look like a dick. Yea sure, it was the intersect messing with him, bla bla, that does not change the way the adience percieved him. Morgan was a sidekick and he should've stayed a sidekick. 
* Generally speaking I feel like the quality in writing and production went down by A LOT in season 5. This may be subjective but it was just the feeling I got from it. It felt forced and rushed and frankly a part of me wants to believe that it was forced. I just don't want to believe that season 5 was the ending that the creators had envisioned when they made the series.

Now that Spotify is available in the US, I was listening to this playlist and noticing some songs that were available, but not on the playlist. Through messages between the two of us, we guessed that it must come down to different rights to the songs depending on the country. I started with that playlist, and then made my own. I was actually surprised by how much was available.

* Now that Fulcrum/The Ring is gone, and the gang is freelance, it wouldn't be putting Chuck in a situation where he would have to arrest her.

* Chuck and co. could probably use a few more good field agents on the team, right?

and perhaps most importantly,

* Jordana Brewster is *amazingly* beautiful.

* Chuck asking her nicely to put on clothes
* Jeff needing extra tranq darts
* The sequence where Morgan explains to Gen. Beckman how the Buy More is too effective while they are leaping around behind him fixing things
* The entire catfight sequence (best fight since [the car one in Chuck vs. The Best Friend](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBmoUTEy9QY))

The only downside was 100% less Linda Hamilton ass-kickery, but it's understandable considering they're probably saving her for later episodes. Also, is Volkoff Industries officially the new ""big bad"" for this season?

Im a person who usually doesnt watch shows or anything like that, there wasnt a show i watched casually over a year and i just.. watched it.
The show was amazing, everything, the story, the emotions, freaking everything.

One day i will watch them allover, but i dont know when. I might sound really pathetic atm, but this show.. was amazing and i cant stop saying it.

I just want to keep my hopes up i will someday hear anything from the nerd-herd or Jeffster(btw really awesome what happened to them) or anything related to this series.. i just dont have words.

I really want to know since i didnt notice anything in the show about this, since it cant be only about Shaws hate toward him, since Shaw had no reason to do this to him before..

I thought this was a good episode.  While I knew the idea of Volkoff having a daughter was too interesting for her to be a one-off character, I wasn't sure where it would go.  Yes, getting her involved with his work was the obvious choice, but I wasn't sure if they would take the route they did, or if she was faking ignorance the whole time as part of a Volkoff plan or something.

Also, the Valentine's Day stuff at the beginning was absolutely priceless.  Sarah's face as the wings popped out, Chuck's Love Machine shirt, and whatever spiritual pattycake nonsense Morgan and Alex were up to, all of it was great.  Plus, Casey's reaction to it all.

I really enjoyed this episode, and I think it set up some very interesting stuff for the rest of the season.  Casey has his own little plot going on now that should be interesting, Chuck and Sarah have their wedding, which will almost definitely close out the season, Morgan's got a girl and is trying to grow up and be independent.

1280337540.0,10,self.chuck,cupul,My wife will soon be caught up with Chuck. Which other show do you recommend for her ?,mpierre,11,1,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/chuck/comments/cupul/my_wife_will_soon_be_caught_up_with_chuck_which/,"**UPDATE - August 23rd - UPDATE **

I showed the first 7 episodes of Arrested Development to my wife. She hated ALL of them. She finds the character too pathetic to be likable and doesn't like ""humiliation humor"", making her resent Tobias and GOB instead of making her like them like we do.

She used to hate Buster's character in Chuck finding him the oddest character in the full 3 seasons of Chuck so far. She hates Buster even more.

However, she read the list here and saw my list of shows and picked a second choice : **Dexter**, which also shares an actor with Chuck : Masuka / Harry Tang.

We've only watched 2 episodes yet. She loved the pilot, found the second episode a little less fun (it is really slow) but still interesting.

The only problem with Dexter so far is that episodes last over 52 minutes, so we don't watch it as often.

On my own level, someone here suggested Fringe, and I have watched ALL of the episodes. It is now one of my favorite shows !


**UPDATE - August 23rd - UPDATE **


---------------------------------------


My wife is very difficult to please with television. 

I am trying to find a TV show to watch with her once we are caught up with Chuck.

------------------------------------
**What she watched and didn't like**

She got bored of True Blood in season 1, of Californication in Season 2 (thought we might pick it up) and couldn't stand how fake the first episode of the L Word looked.

She liked Doctor Who, well, most of the episodes, but it took several attempts to get through TorchWood season 1. We watched a lot of 30 Rock together but at some point she lost interest in it.

She watched the first 3 seasons of Big Love, but I didn't like the 4th and from my critics, she decided to stop there.

She watched a few episodes of Bullshit! when the subject interested her, but isn't a fan of the show in general.

She used to love Dead Zone and saw the first 3 seasons or so, but that's another show that slipped out and she stopped watching it.

She saw the first season of house and decided to never watch it again even under duress.

She saw a lot of episodes of Being Erica and loved it at first but in the second season gave up finding it unbelievable because Erica wasn't progressing at all emotionally despite her therapy.

She loves the Simpsons but hates Futurama and South Park.

She loved the first 3 seasons of Kyle XY but I hated the last one and decided not to subject her to it.

She loves Scrubs and almost saw episode with JD still in it. Doesn't want to see the last season and I can't blame her.

She got me to watch Prison Break, but she stopped the moment they killed Sara and didn't want to hear more about it.

After 4 or 5 episodes of L O S T 5 years ago she told me : ""The writers have no idea where they are going. This looks like a mystery show, but I think it's really a character driven show. It will end in tears because they won't explain half of the mysteries. They'll just lose focus"". I brushed it off, but damn it, she was right.

----------------------------------------------
**Why she loves Chuck**

Chuck on the other hand, was an instant hit.

She loves how the action moves, the characters (almost all of them), the way they evolve, the way the spy action is mixed with the Buy More and Chuck's personal life.

She found Season 2 better than season 1, and so far, she thinks that season 3 is the best TV she ever watched.

----------------------------------------
**Why am I looking for another show**

We quite enjoy spending time together to watch TV shows as it helps us disconnect from our day work and help us get closer afterwards. It's a pause in our stress.

So, she likes shows that help you relax. Shows like Dexter and Breaking Bad are too heavy for our downtime. I am not saying she might not enjoy them, but it's too much for the current one or episode per day (one before bed and one at lunch time) marathon.

Shows without any sort of romantic twists need something else to get her interesting. For example, she liked Red Dwarf because it's funny. 

--------------------------------------
**Possible Choices**

I am thinking of the following shows, but sadly, none of them sound like a good post-Chuck choice :

- Warehouse 13
- The IT Crowd
- The rest of Californication (the current default choice, but I am running out of episodes and the problem will resume afterwards)
- Arrested Development (but I am not sure she'll like the humor)
- Weeds, but I am not sure it's her style
- Royal Pains
- Dollhouse
- Human Target
- Krod Mandoon (but since it's only 6 episodes, it won't buy a lot of time)
- Second and Third season of TorchWood

---------------------------------
**Ideas I have rejected**

I do not think the following shows would be a good match for various reasons:

- Lie to me (I am sure she will hate Dr Lightman)
- Castle: she doesn't like murder mysteries
- Buffy (she hated the movie)
- Community: not her style of humor
- Pushing Daisies : told her about it and it didn't interest her
- FlashPoint : tried several time to get her into it.

Is there any gems I have forgotten ?

Edit:
To get us started here is one of my epiphanies 

I never really realized this until I rewatched the entire series. Bryce Larkin was a saint.

He was outside of chuck one of the most honorable men ever conceived. He dedicated his life to protecting his best friend, giving him the tools to find and uncover the truth about his father, and risked his life selflessly on multiple occasions.

And the nail in the coffin, the moment he realized Sarah was in love with chuck too, he accepted it and only spoke good of her till the end.

It might just be because Season 4 is fresh in my mind still, though. I'm currently in the middle of an entire series re-watch for the summer, so maybe I'll change my mind after I get to Season 3.

Sarah is going to have to go about remembering everything on her own, if that even happens.  Im sure it will, they will be together and happy again, etc, etc.

What's kind of sad is that Chuck has the intersect all over again.  Is that going to be the only thing that will get Sarah to fall in love with him all over again?  I do wan't to point out that it was very clever of the writers to show that chuck is kind of screwed when it comes to getting away from the intersect.  It's just going to follow him everywhere.  I like that.  

Also, shouldn't Sarah still have the intersect as well?  When, if at all, would Quinn have taken it out of her?  How would he have been able to do that?  Did he just flash it out of her?  

And, just to kind of bitch about the writers for the ending:


They have given us a happy ending every time they expected to have had to end the show.


End of season 2 chuck got the cooler intersect: ""I know kung fu""


Midway through season 3: Chuck and Sarah get together and are happy, etc, etc


End of Season 3 was just set up with the thought of going into 4.


End of season 4 was the same thing, with the thought of going into season 5.


Why now, when they know they are going to end the show, do they decide to go with the mysterious and sad ending?  Chuck has been built on the whole happily ever after thing.  I really think their ending was brave and all that.  Hell, something I never even expected.  They deserve a lot of credit for that.  Im convinced that they had already used up all their happy endings.  Maybe they just wanted to be different.  As a viewer you will never get the satisfactions that everything will turn out okay, even if it is implies that Sarah has a good chance at remember Chuck all over again.  All Chuck would really have to do is give Sarah her spy will thing, take Sarah to visit her mom, dad, and anyone else that saw them together.  Im sure the CIA/Beckman would have no problem helping Chuck and Sarah get her memory back. 

If they made a movie, it should take place the day after the beach.  Screw that happy magical ending of insta memory coming back.  Sarah would go back to the CIA and Chuck would easily follow her back there.  He has the intersect anyways.  It would be fun to see Sarah forced to work with Chuck again.  I would love to see Chuck have to win her over again.

Good show all around.  Been a fun 5 years.  Really glad they got to give it a proper ending.  Even if it had an unexpected, sad ending.

The song is perfect, the scene is perfect, and i love the ambiguity. I cannot think of a better way to end my favorite show of all time. To be honest if they didn't include the whole thing with sarah losing her memory it would just make for a bland cheesy ending. While that may sound nice to some of you, I feel like if it ended on a normal note like that it wouldn't have enough conclusion to it and you would simply be waiting for the next episode. The way it ended, while ambiguous, did have a good ending feel to it. However, this is here nor there for what i wanted to say. What really bugs me about the final scene is something very small, but its just a continuity issue that i always notice. When they lean in to kiss, chuck goes in where is nose would be on the left, then the cutaway shows him going to the right, and then the actual kiss is with him on the left. Its so small but it just bugs me because it seems like they're showing a repeat of him going in but they're wrong. Maybe i'm the only one who noticed it.

Other thoughts:

* Rob Riggle was perfectly cast as Agent Rye and so was Summer Glau (*cough*FIREFLY*cough*) as this week's Greta
* It was awesome to see a softer side to Casey, but for him still to retain his ""no touching policy""
* The brief grunting match between Greta and Casey was so awesome.


*My crackpot theory:*

[my theory](/s ""Anyone else think that this Belgian character is really part of Rye's treatment therapy? There was no independent confirmation of The Belgian's nefarious nature other than Rye's word. Wasn't it already established that no one knows that Chuck is the intersect except maybe his Mom/Volkoff at this point? So if The Belgian knew this, wouldn't that point to an elaborate ruse? Also, wouldn't they not want to kill off Rob Riggle so that he could possibly come back in a different episode?"")

Well, ambiguity has never been my strong point and when something is left ambiguous to me I get upset about it. So, I of course had to find reason to the rhyme.

Sarah's memory was coming back at a rate, perhaps not consistent as it seemed all over the place (as she remembered, or I could be wrong in my memory, that she wrote Chuck &amp; Sarah in the house at one point, and about the the porn virus that diffused the bomb from Season One) but it was coming back steadily and it obviously would come back full circle at one point, how long? Who knows. But it was this ambiguity that left me to wonder, will the Sarah we know come back, or will she feel like a different Sarah with all these memories of someone else?

So, obviously, that worsened the ambiguity. I then spent time thinking about her character, and how unusual it was that she was so adamant about getting her memories back. Why? She stated she didn't 'feel it' and wanted to tell Chuck a proper goodbye, so it leaves me confused. Does she deep down inside love a man she barely knows (at this point, near the ending), or is it that she wants her memories back? I like to think that due to my personality if I lost all my memories and was told I had fallen in love with some girl, I would want to find my own path and not be told what I did, if that makes sense. Just because I did doesn't mean I have to be if I can't remember it. Plus, she's a spy and she could think it's a cover.

I'm over analyzing I know, but with Chuck gone it's all I can do about the show until they bring a book or maybe a movie telling the less than unknown ending of Chuck and Sarah.",,False,self,t5_2r4nd,False,,,True,t3_pgt76,http://www.reddit.com/r/chuck/comments/pgt76/a_thought_about_chucks_finale/,

The only things I can think of are:

* **Flashing from audio.** I can think of at least two instances where Casey has had to hold up pictures of certain people to Chuck to see if he would flash. If the intersect was upgraded to include speech recognition then Chuck could simply be read a list of names and flash, or even pick out a baddie in a large crowd by picking up on his voice.

* **Access to different personalities, a la Dollhouse.** Sometimes Chuck has a bit of difficulty pulling off the ""tough guy"" routine, and this could help him with that, among other things.

* **Internet access?** This seems simple enough. Wouldn't even be the first time a sci-fi series has done it, either. But he could also possibly access live security camera feeds and whatnot... all in his brain.

NBC always questions why they dont do great in the ratings or have good shows.  Well they seem to not either promote shows well, put them on when they have to compete with shows like Survivor, American idol, and other well known and established shows.  For example they just cancelled a show after 2 seasons(Harry's Law) and it was one of there highest rated shows in the last year or so. Chucked seemed to be doing good.  I know shows coming to an end and cancelling have to do with the producers/writers being done with the show but NBC is messing up some good shows by not giving them much time to get ratings up.
