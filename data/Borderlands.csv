1348411805.0,1872,self.Borderlands,10ccgi,The Great Borderlands 2/Season Pass Giveaway!,ArmoredCavalry,2784,912,308,http://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/10ccgi/the_great_borderlands_2season_pass_giveaway/,"Hello fellow (or soon to be) Vault Hunters. In honor of the recent release of one of my favorite games, Boderlands 2, I've decided to host a giveaway.

You may be familiar with the previous ""Great Steam Game Giveaways"" I ran over on r/gaming.

For this giveaway, you have the chance to win your choice of either Borderlands 2 (the base game), or if you already own it, the Season Pass for all future DLC!

**How to Enter**

To enter the giveaway, just fill out the entry form here:

~~Official Entry Form V3.14~~-Entries now closed!

Also, I humbly request you consider upvoting this post to show your support if you do enter the giveaway.

You must have a reddit account that is more than a day old to participate (to prevent cheating).

The winner will be randomly selected sometime tomorrow, and announced in this post, as well as PM'ed their prize.

**CheapShark**

The giveaway is only possible because of previous support of the site I've been working on, [CheapShark.com](http://www.cheapshark.com/browse.php)

Basically, CheapShark indexes digital game deals on Steam, Amazon, Gamer's Gate, GreenManGaming, and more. You can sort by deal rating, sign up for email alerts when the prices drops on a game you want, and more. The goal is to make getting the best deal on PC games easier than ever.

So, if you appreciate these giveaways, be sure to check it out!

Thanks for reading, and good luck!

Edit: Also, please note you will need a Steam account to register/play Borderlands 2 or the DLC.

Final Update: Congrats to the winner, comeon_fhqwhgads, I have PM'ed you your prize!",,False,self,t5_2r8cd,1348528537.0,,phasewalk,True,t3_10ccgi,http://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/10ccgi/the_great_borderlands_2season_pass_giveaway/,

If its not here then the skill works exactly as it says in the tooltip.

After many hours of testing this is what I have.

____
General combat

* Kill skills last **7 seconds**

* Melee attacks crit for **2x** damage and none of the critical hit damage bonuses change that.

* The melee damage bonus % found on weapons is multiplicative rather than additive, like most % damage increases.

____
***Zero***
____


* **Deception** 

Action Skill. Press button to create a holographic decoy and vanish for a few seconds**(6 seconds)**. The longer you are invisible the more Damage your next attack deals, but ending invisibility sooner causes your next deception cooldown to refresh faster **(minimum cooldown of 10 seconds before cooldown reduction)**. Maximum Cooldown 15 seconds.

**A minimum of  230%** up to +650% Melee Damage

**A minimum of 40%** Up to +200% Gun Damage

~~Up to +250% Gun Critical Hit Damage~~

Lies. **Deception does not give any Critical him damage increase** at all, it simply increases gun damage by up to 200% before the [critical hit multiplier of the weapon](http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Critical_hit_%28Borderlands_2%29).  I think this text it there to remind you that maybe you should try to land a critical hit with the deception damage bonus.

_____
***Bloodshed***


* **Killing blow**

When exactly is an enemy  **""low on health""** ? 

When below **30% health**.

The damage bonus from this skill is multiplicative rather than additive, that is why you get astronomical numbers when using it.

* **Execute**

How much exactly is this **""massive damage""** ?

This skill changes the melee damage bonus of deception from 

A minimum of 230% up to 650% Melee damage to

**A minimum of 460% up to 1400% increased Melee damage**

* **Many must fall**

How much time does it add to the duration of Deception ?

**~2 seconds**
_____

***Cunning***

* **Counter Strike**

What activates it ? 

Bullets and melee attacks definitely do, most likely is any enemy attack that is not damage over time.

* **Ambush**

Do I get the bonus if enemies are targeting my decoy ? 

**Yes**, if you are in deception then you are getting the bonus damage no matter what.

* **Unforeseen**

Do the additional decoys created by **Many must fall explode** ?

**Yes.**

* **Death Mark**

The damage bonus is multiplicative or additive ?

**Multiplicative.**

* **Death Blossom**

You throw 4 daggers at a time and you can do that 5 times. They can have any of the 5 elemental types. This skill is a very reliable way of applying slag and overall it does fantastic damage on its own.

To apply **Death mark** you have to directly hit an enemy, the elemental explosions do not apply it.

___
***Sniping***

* **Kill Confirmed**

How long does it take to get the full bonus ?

**~ 2.7 seconds**

* **Critical Ascension**

You start losing stacks after **6 seconds.**

You lose 1 stack Per second.

Switching weapon, opening a menu(map, inventory, quest log, etc), using a vending machine, talking to a quest giver and dieing instantly removes all stacks.

You can melee,throw grenades and sprint without losing all stacks !

___

***Gaige***
___

* **Summon Deathtrap**

60 seconds cooldown, 60 seconds duration. Time between melee attacks - 1.5 seconds.
___
***Ordered Chaos***

* **Robot Rampage**

**Cooldown - 13 seconds.**

Misleading tooltip. It's not 7 attacks, it's  **9+1 attacks**.

DT spins for 2 seconds dealing 9 attacks to all enemies near him. Each of those 9 attacks does 62% of his normal melee attack damage. At the end of his spin he does an instant normal attack with no delay for full damage.


In other words, with this skill deathtrap does up to **658%** of his melee damage in 2 seconds.

* **Discord**

Cost - **1.33 stacks per second.**

* **Death from Above**

Cooldown - 2 seconds.

Sadly this awesome skill was not implemented very well. You don't have full control over when it activates. Shooting while walking on uneven surfaces or getting hit by bullets and getting lifting inches off the ground as result can activate this skill.  As a result investing in this skill can makes managing your Anarchy stacks much harder.

* **The Nth Degree**

**Do NOT invest more than one point in this skill.**

In the best case scenario (if there are always enemies in range) you will get 11.1% damage increase from this skill. This is not a bad deal, however for investing 4 more skill points you will only increase that bonus to 20%. Because of this investing more than 1 is a complete waste of skill points.

* **With Claws**

At the cost of 1 Anarchy stack you do 2 swipes, both doing full melee damage and both healing you for % of your missing heath.

At 1% heath this skill heals for up to ~**30%** of your heath per swipe. At 90% health it will heal for ~5% of your health.

Also important to note is that because of both swipes do full melee damage and the speed at which you can use this attack this skill effectively gives you **50%  increased melee attack speed.**

___
***Little Big Trouble***

* **The Stare**

**Cooldown - 15 seconds.**

Does high amount of burn damage to a **single target.**

Not affected by Evil Enchantress or badass rank bonuses.

* **Shock Storm**

Can activate Electrical burn even if created by Deathtrap.

* **One Two Boom**

**Cooldown - 42 seconds.**

Cannot be activated with E-tech weapons.

* **Interspersed Outburst**

First stack after **2 seconds** of not shooting.

Full stacks after **9.3 seconds** of not shooting.

**The damage is based on character level and the number of stacks only.** It will do the same damage with 1 or 5 points invested.
**The chance to slag is 2% per rank for each stack.** So with 5 stacks at rank 5 the chance to slag is 50%.

This is how it works in TVHM, I can't test that anymore but I think before finishing the game in normal mode the damage of the skill worked differently, class mods did not increase the damage, but investing points in to it did.


***Make It Sparkle***

Each of his melee attacks does additional damage equal to **2x** his base melee damage.

Because it takes the base damage and not the actual damage Strength of 5 Gorillas, Upshot Robot and Made of Stern Stuff do not increase the elemental damage his melee attacks do.

The elemental damage he does is also affected by the elemental damage type multipliers. So for example if Deathtrap does 1000 damage with his melee attacks and you slag him, now he will deal 1000 normal damage + 2000 slag damage per melee attack. If you set him on fire and send him after fleshy things he will do  1000 + 3500.

**But there is more, this thing works with Robot Rampage and that combination is absolutely  phenomenal.**

This is because it does the full bonus elemental damage on each attack.

Let me toss some numbers at you.

My level 39 Deathtrap does 5500 damage with his melee attack. If I send him with no upgrades vs a Super Badass Loader he will do 11k damage in 2 seconds.

If he has Make it Sparkle and Robot Rampage and I give him corrosive attacks he will do:

36190 damage normal damage + 192500 corrosive damage.

**So from 11k to 229k damage in 2 seconds.**

And I could slag that enemy for him, **so my level 39 Deathtrap can do 457k damage in 2 seconds. I can't imagine what a level 50 Deathtrap can do.**
___
***Best Friends Forever***

* **Buck Up**

**Cooldown - 18 seconds.**

Because of a bug Deathtrap will sometimes use this ability on your enemies.

In True Vault Hunter Mode it only restores 30% of your shields.

Because of this in TVHM this skill is a complete waste of Deathtraps time and should always be avoided.

I can't test this any more, but while leveling Gaige  it felt like this skill was restoring 100% of my shields, or even more than that, but when I tested it in TVHM it was only restoring 30%(as the tooltip states). Going back to Normal mode after I have unlocked TVHM does not change that.

* **Explosive Clap**

**Cooldown - 25 seconds.**

Does pretty good amount of damage in a very large radius.

* **Sharing is Caring**

Deathtrap does not benefit from the special effect of Amp Shields.

Spike, Nova, Roid and Booster work as you would expect.

Absorb shields do not give you ammo, I can't tell if they are protecting DT from bullets.

Don't have a way of testing if Turtle shields reduce his heath or do adaptive shields boost his health and resistances.

___

***Maya***
___
* **Phaselock**

How long does it last by default ?

**5 seconds**
___
***Cataclysm***

* **Flicker**

How does it work ?

It increases the chance to apply an elemental effect that the weapon has by said %.
(example, weapon has 40% chance to ignite, with 5 points in this skill it will become 52% chance to ignite)

* **Helios**

Does it apply to targets that cannot be phaselocked ?

**Yes.**

* **Ruin**

How does it work ?

It creates 3  explosions with the center being the phaselocked target. Slag, Electric and Corrosive explosion in that order. Works on targets that cannot be phaselocked.

___
***Harmony***

* **Life tap**

How does it work ?

Instantly restores health equal to x% of any damage you do. Works with  guns, rocket launchers, grenades, melee attacks, damage over time effects, any damage you do.

* **Scorn**

How does it work ? 

Sends out a slow moving orb that explodes on impact doing minor slag damage. While flying the orb also sends out slag tendrils to all enemies around it, quickly applying the slag debuff to them. Very reliable  way of applying slag to multiple enemies.

___
***Motion***

* **Kinetic Reflection**

Can I become immune to bullets if I have 10 points in to this skill ?

**Yes.**

* **Sub-Sequence**

How does it work ?

Once the phaselocked target dies the spell starts moving the same way homing grenades do and seeks another target.

While the spell is moving to another target the duration of phaselock keeps going down. Also when its seeking another target Wreck, Elated and Chain reaction are not active.

Every time it hits a new target Converge and Helios are reapplied.

* **Thoughtlock**

Do Converge, Helios, Wreck, Chain reaction and Elated work with Thoughtlock ?

**Yes.**


___
***Salvador***
___

* **Gunzerking**

By default this skill lasts 20 seconds and provides 33.3% damage reduction.

___
***Brawn***

* **I'm the Juggernaut**

At 5 points the 20% damage reduction you are supposed to get is more like ~16.5%. It's a great skill nonetheless.

When combined with **Gunzerking** it results in 41% damage reduction.

* **Fistful of Hurt**

How much is ""massive damage"" ?

**300%** increased melee damage (multiplicative).

* **Come At Me Bro**

How much damage reduction do I get and how long does it last ?

The buff lasts **8 seconds** and it increases the damage reduction to **66.6%**. 

When combined with **I'm the Juggernaut**(5 points) it results in  ~ 71% damage reduction.

___
***Rampage***


* **Get Some**

It is important to note that this skill also works while you are **Gunzerking**, this means that by the time your Gunzerking timer runs out you might have it off cooldown and ready to be used again immediately.


* **Keep Firing...**


How does it work ?

You just have to keep your finger on the triggers, lift them for more the 1 second and the magic is gone.

Reloading does not seem to affect the bonus fire rate.


Not sure exactly how long it takes to get the maximum bonuses, its not longer than 10 seconds.

____
***Gun Lust***

* **All I Need is One**

Best thing about this skill is that it works with rocket launchers.

* **Money Shot**

Does not work with Rocket Launchers. 

No all that great when using TORGUE weapons because of the way explosive weapon damage is calculated.

With 5 points in the skill the damage bonus for **clip size** is as follows:

1 = 0% (You sttil hear the sound, but there is no bonus damage)

2 = 80%

3 = 120%

4 = 160%

5 = 200%

6 = 240%

7 = 280%

8 = 320%

9 = 360%

10 = 400%

**11 = 440%!**

**12+ = 480%!**

I had to farm the Warrior for white items with small clip sizes to test this, but finding out that the optimal clip size is actually 12 makes it all worth it.

* **Keep It Piping Hot**

Because of a bug this skill does not work if you have any cooldown reduction bonuses.

* **No Kill Like Overkill**

How does it work ?

It works exactly as it says, however the bonus damage you can get is capped. 

The cap is 5x as much damage as you would do with no overkill bonus. That damage bonus is multiplicative and is applied at the end of the equation.

Whatever damage you can do without the overkill bonus you can do up to 5 times as much damage with the overkill bonus, as long as you follow the same rules.
For example if you can hit a slagged target for 100k damage with the bonus from ""All I need is one"" and ""Money Shot"" and no Overkill bonus, then with maximum overkill bonus damage you should be able to hit a target for 500k, as long as it is also slagged and you have the ""all I need is one"" and ""Money shot"" bonuses.

At least that is how I think it works, I have not played all that much with this skill so I might be completely wrong on this one.
___
***Axton***
___

* **Sabre Turret**

How long does it last by default ?

23 seconds, but because it takes some time to deploy and start shooting its **20 seconds** at best.  Also by default it fires 8 rounds per burst.

___

***Gunpowder***

* **Steady**

This skill states that it increases grenade damage, that is true, but that bonus grenade damage also applies to the explosive round of TORGUE weapons and Tediore reload explosions.

* **Do or die**

Same thing as **Steady.**

* **Battlefront** 

Same as the two above, but it also gives gun damage, that means that TORGUE weapons double dip with this skill for a massive damage increase.

* **Nuke**

Is there any way to increase the damage this thing does ?

Slag the target before deploying the turret, Death mark from Zero should also increase the damage. Nothing else as far as I know.

____
***Guerrilla***

* **Scorched Earth**

Equipping your turret with rocked pods also decreases the damage the gun of the turret does by **13%**
 
* **Double Up**

This upgrade also decreases the gun damage by **13%**. This results in a **74%** increased damage  for having 2 guns rather than the 100% increase that you would expect. 
If you combine this with rocket pods then you will be only getting **54%** increased turret gun damage.

If you take Gemini without pods then you will have 100% increased turret gun damage, with pods - 74%.

All of that does not mean that rocket pods are not worth it.

We've implemented a couple new features to *try* and help some of you folk from being plot-spoiled.  If you happen to bypass these things and ruin the story for yourself, please don't blame us.



1.  Starting Sept 17th, /r/borderlands will be stricltly TEXT POSTS ONLY.  There will be no direct links to images or anything else.  This will help deter from thumbnail spoilers and general screenshot karma whoring.  **We know the international users won't get the game until the 21st, so guys please remember your fellow vault hunters and don't ruin it for them.**  We will return the subreddit to normal working order when we decide it has been plenty of time.


2.  We've put in place a new link flair that will completely hide title text on /r/borderlands front page.  This won't work for your general reddit front page but it'll have a spoiler tag there.  [Here](http://imgur.com/a/OYVUu) is what that looks like.


3.  Updated comment spoiler tags.  If you're going to talk about the BL2 story in the comments section, we urge you to use the spoiler tags.  This also goes for the BL1 story.  Here's how:

[text goes here\](/spoiler)

[text goes here](/spoiler)


[text goes here\](/spoiler ""BL2"")

[text goes here](/spoiler ""BL2"")


You can optionally replace BL2 with BL1....just whatever you want to use.  If you don't even want use those, that's okay too.

**If we receive reports that your comment is not properly marked, we will remove it.**


----


I think that's all for the new features.  Now, other stuff.


**SPOILER FLAIR:**  We will be closely moderating this subreddit over the next week to try and stop spoilers from being posted.  Remember, after you have submitted your link post and it directs you to the comment page:

* [Hit this button](http://i.imgur.com/vZ1EX.png).  This will take you to the flair box.

* Hit [the spoiler button and then SAVE](http://i.imgur.com/x4Wmw.png).  

**Note: If you fail to do this and we catch it, WE WILL CHANGE IT OURSELVES.  DO NOT CHANGE IT BACK.**



**Youtube channels/playthroughs:**  It's fine if you post these during next week.  It's fine if you want to post loot chest unboxing videos/imgur albums.  Those don't necessarily have to be marked as spoilers since we're just worried about the story of the game.  If you say **ANYTHING** about the story, mark it as a spoiler please.

*/r/borderlands will not make your youtube channel an official channel/playthrough channel or advertise your videos in any way.  Sorry.  We're not picking favorites or inadvertently generating your ad revenue.*



**EDIT**  Text posts only means no linked topic titles outside of this subreddit.  You can link to these pics/loot/youtubes inside your self post just make sure you mark your topic as spoilers.  That's what the whole spoilers feature is all about.



That's all.  Let's all have fun next week!  ...and...

I write this, because on reddit and on their facebook, I have seen hundreds of people complain about the following:

1. The time the codes go live
2. The Length the codes are active
3. The fact the codes go down 3 minutes before the actual end-time
4. The fact the keys aren't just **given** to our accounts

This here, is the definition of entitlement. This here is the sole reason why **the gaming community as a whole is turning to shit**. You do not in any way, shape or form deserve nor require these keys for the game. They have no obligation to give the keys to anyone, outside of the fact they advertised the **Golden Chest** as part of the game, and even still they could give these codes out **only** in contests.

But **NO**. They choose to give these codes out **constantly and for free**, which require you to literally **ONLY** check:

1. Twitter
2. Facebook
3. /r/Borderlands

They do not ask you to pay them for it, they do not ask you to subscribe to their pages or twitter to receive an e-mail with the code in it. They ask for 18 seconds of your precious time to look at their pages and copy the code. They ask something from you, that no other developer [or very VERY few] would ask of you, and that is that **YOU DO NOTHING but check their pages**.

And to top it off, people complain that they are giving out **TEN** codes this weekend, at **ALL TIMES**, so even people in other timezones have a fair chance to get them. You missed out on **two codes** because they were up at 4am EST? Well cry me a river you pompous fuck. Other people only got **4-6** because they live in an entirely different timezone. God forbid your entitled ass has to wait up to **FOUR** days to get MORE FREE KEYS.

Any other publisher or developer wouldn't be doing this. They'd be making gimmicky contests, requiring you to **""Make a caption to this funny** *""LOL OUR DEVELOPMENT TEAM""* **picture to enter for a chance to get a key!**, or asking you to subscribe, pay or do some other jump-through-hoop bullshit at chances to open a chest that has awesome shit in it. Instead, they give you **10 KEYS TO USE WHICH HAS MULTIPLE ITEMS IN THE FUCKING CHEST ANYWAYS**.

So **thank you GearBox!**. Thank you for understanding how a developer should act. So far you have managed to do the following:

1. Create day-1 pre-order bonuses that give an advantage to people for about 25 minutes of gameplay
2. Create day-1 pre-order DLC for a character you didn't have finished, but had proof-of-concept for
3. Stayed true to the franchise and, in almost all aspects, improved the game with only sacrificing very little in other forms
4. Let us see [Fyrestone again... thank you **SO** much for this..](/spoiler)
5. Took us on an emotional rollercoaster
6. Are constantly giving your community something that almost any other developer would be selling or advertising in some way to gain them and their company.

You guys have, as far as I am concerned, gone above and beyond what most other developers do, and I look forward to supporting you guys every way I can as long as you stay on this track.",,False,self,t5_2r8cd,False,,,True,t3_126c3x,http://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/126c3x/a_personal_thanks_to_gearbox_for_being_an_awesome/,

Hey guys! I saw there were 7 posts today asking about DLC level scaling, when to do them, and should \[the OP] bother doing them before \[next playthrough]. All but one are at the 1/2 point mark because I guess people are frustrated seeing these posts so frequently. So I got to thinking; Why are these posts so common? The answer is in the scores. If only a single post ([this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1h80yo/should_i_just_skip_all_of_the_dlcs_in_the_1st/)) out of all of these gets a score that requires two hands to count, and that post is on the *third* page of the sub (#58 as of now), people don't SEE anything about the DLC. Add in a touch of classic ""I don't need to use the search bar"" and you get the current situation. As such, I've compiled a bit of info from helpful posts/comments to hopefully put together something worthy of the sidebar or FAQ. (I say that because there is such a ""When should I play the DLC?"" post in the BL1 section of the FAQ).

**THE SEASON PASS**

Many people have had threads downvoted to Dagon's plane for asking about this. This is kind of understandable as not many of the immediate google search results are entirely clear. Heck, even the BL wiki doesn't have a page for it. The Season Pass includes the 4 campaign DLCs (outlined below), and the Ultimate Vault Hunter Upgrade Pack (Levels 51-61, enabling pearlescent weapons to drop in UVHM), all for the price of 3 individual campaign DLCs. Well worth the money. It does not include [Krieg](http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Krieg) or 
[Gaige](http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Gaige), the character DLCs. It does not include any of the skin/head DLCs seen at the Customisation Stations/Quick Change stations. There's always one guy who claims it was, so I'll say *no*, it was not stated that Gaige came with the season pass. If you didn't pay for her (and didn't pirate her or something) then you preordered the game.

**I ONLY HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO GET (n) DLCs, WHICH SHOULD I BUY?**

Generally it would be recommended that you wait until you can afford the season pass. It's cheaper than all the campaign DLC individually and includes the Ultimate Vault Hunter Upgrade Pack (worst named DLC ever: this is the levels 51-61 pack). Unless you are hell-bent on getting Krieg or Gaige (I certainly was for Gaige), I would get the Season Pass first. More game content &gt; same content with a new toon IMO, and I think just about anybody would agree. If you must choose between them: I think general opinion is something like this, in order of decreasing awesomeness:

* [Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep](http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Tiny_Tina%27s_Assault_on_Dragon_Keep) (Accessed at ""Unassuming Docks"" in Fast Travel)
* [Mr. Torgue's Campaign of Carnage](http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Mr._Torgue%27s_Campaign_of_Carnage) (Accessed at ""Badass Crater of Badassitude"" in Fast Travel)
* [Captain Scarlett and Her Pirate's Booty](http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Captain_Scarlett_and_Her_Pirate's_Booty) (Accessed at ""Oasis"" in Fast Travel)
* [Sir Hammerlock's Big Game Hunt](http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Sir_Hammerlock's_Big_Game_Hunt) (Accessed at ""Hunter's Grotto"" in Fast Travel)

However this is merely a guide, individual opinions vary. 

In terms of character DLC, which (if you have to choose) you should buy probably depends largely on which characters you play/have played. If you've not played anything seriously melee related, Krieg is likely the better choice for you. If you've played axton, I think you'll find DT to be a (slightly buggy) breath of fresh air. You now have a *[moving](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m4wmujqL0f1qf1ln8.gif)* source of damage! Of course this is harder for me to quantify and give an objective opinion on, as not every player uses Krieg for melee or Gaige for Deathtrap, for example.

**DLC LEVEL SCALING OF QUESTS AND ENEMIES**

The levels of the enemies and missions in the DLCs are as follows: 

* Captain Scarlett and her Pirate's Booty - levels 15 to 30
* Mr. Torgue's Campaign of Carnage - levels 15 to 30
* Sir Hammerlock's Big Game Hunt - levels 30 to 35
* Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep - levels 30 to 35

*As /u/Danarhys pointed out, the latter two of these are rife with spoilers from the main game! You shouldn't play them in normal mode  until (at the very, very least) you're in the Arid Nexus. This is reflected in their lower level cap.* 

In True Vault Hunter Mode (TVHM), enemy levels in the DLCs will scale to around the player's level starting from around their Normal Mode playthrough level caps *(30,30,35,35 respectively)* until level 50.

In Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode (UVHM), enemy levels in the DLCs will scale to around the player's level starting from around level 50 until level 61.

Taken from /u/intergalacticninja's comment [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1h80yo/should_i_just_skip_all_of_the_dlcs_in_the_1st/carrfcb). The italics bit is mine, added for clarity. 

**WHAT ORDER SHOULD I DO THEM IN? SHOULD I DO THEM NOW OR LATER?**

The following assumes you own all 4 campaign DLCs either by purchasing the Season Pass, or by purchasing them individually. I would like to start this section by saying that no, you don't need to do all DLC in all playthroughs.

In normal mode you can start them as soon as you're at the lower level limit, and any time after that. If you're hitting level 36/37, you may want to just stop and move on to True Vault Hunter Mode, playthrough 2. You won't get much XP for enemies and quests that are levels below you, and all gear will be capped at 30 or 35 anyway, so unless there's a particular item you want from a DLC quest, I wouldn't stress about fully completing them.

You need to be a bit careful in TVHM, especially in Playthrough 2.5 (after you beat the final boss again and hit Level 50) because trying to keep all sidequests (that's another topic, won't cover it here) and DLC quests for when you hit level 50 is a recipe for disaster. XP gain is nerfed once you hit 50, to minimise your ability to level up thereafter. This is (in practise) to prevent you grinding to level 61 and entering UVHM only to fight level 63 badasses (or level [66 Dukes of Ork](/spoiler)) with you level 50 legendary weapons you've farmed. I guarantee you will be ~~touched in places by herbert~~ struggling to a Dark Souls/Demon Souls degree. The difference between a level 50 DPUH (a specific, powerful, and desirable variant of the [Unkempt Harold](http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Unkempt_Harold)), which can do 15145x2 damage (item card damage, from [wiki](http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Unkempt_Harold/Variant_Chart)) and a level 61 version which coud deal 58923x2 (same source as above) is incredible. Your level 50 gear is worthless at L61, with the possible exception of the Slagga, and that's only if you just use it for slagging. This was kind of ranty but UVHM is a free DLC so I decided to include it. The point is you should really only do the side quests from the main game and the DLC main/side quests that give you gear your character would need for UVHM. Typically that at least includes [The Bee](http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/The_Bee) and (more commonly obtained by duping) the [Legendary Class Mod](http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Class_Mod_(Borderlands_2\)) for your character, plus whatever else you feel you need or just want.

Once you get to UVHM, do whatever the hell you like. Seriously. Need a Sandhawk at level 54? Do the Pirate DLC, get one, and you can reset the playthrough once you get to 61 if you decide you want a level 61 version and aren't up to trade/dupe for one. The DLCs all scale all the time in UVHM (as does the rest of the game) so you can do literally anything, one you don't mind resetting the PT at some stage.

**CONCLUSION**

Hopefully this puts to rest some of the confusion floating around here. I guarantee there are typos and probably broken links, so please do let me know. I'm quite tired. :(

Peace out!

An in-depth look into everyone's favorite explosive weapons dealer!,Hitcha,744,126,279,http://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/127du0/torgue_an_indepth_look_into_everyones_favorite/,"Hello fellow Vault Hunters! Being an avid Commando with well over 100 hours into this fabulous game, I'd thought I'd take a moment and explain to you the fantastic power of TORGUE weapons. Some people might ask ""Why should I consider using TORGUE weapons?"" Here's a list of reasons why you should use TORGUE: 

* Bandit have large magazines
* Dahl burst fire
* Hyperion increase accuracy
* Jakobs are semi-automatic
* Maliwan are elemental
* Tediore throw when reloaded
* Vladof are fully automatic
* **TORGUE WEAPONS EXPLODE, EVERY TIME, ALL THE TIME!**

Get the picture? TORGUE is all about turning your enemies in piles of glump while you walk about their dangling limbs. TORGUE is all about using CAPITAL LETTERS. TORGUE is all about receiving ***ridiculous*** damage increases due to game mechanics. 

[Summary: TORGUE is the most badass manufacturer to ever send guns to Pandora.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_sy4tXtjjY)

Now you may ask ""But fellow Vault Hunter, if TORGUE guns are so awesome, how come I've never really bothered to use them before?"" 

Answer: You never did the **MATH** behind TORGUE weapons. That's what this guide is for!

**TORGUE MATH TIME**

Our lovely explosive test subject for today is a finely crafted [Hand Cannon](http://i.imgur.com/kBpO2.jpg). At an impressive 7,645 Damage she is a beauty. Let's take her down to the Marcus Munitions Firing Range and do some testing.

Now, when you fire a TORGUE weapon at an enemy there are **4** possible outcomes: 

* You hit the target
* You critically hit the target (good job!)
* You miss the target, but near enough so the target experiences splash damage
* You miss the target completely (this disappoints TORGUE)

First, let's get a nice base damage test. This is done without talents, mods, badass points, or any other kind of buff active, and with our 7,645 Damage pistol:

* Splash Damage: 7,645 (base!)
* Hit: 15,289 (200% increase!)
* Critical Hit: 22,934 (300% increase!)

So! Our little pistol has the capability to deal **22,934** Damage in one shot, with a starting Damage of just 7,645. 

Now, let's start factoring in some bonuses! To start things off, we'll add **20% Gun Damage** with 5/5 Axton's Impact skill.

* Splash Damage: 9,174 (20% increase!)
* Hit: 18,347 (240% increase!)
* Critical Hit: 27,521 (360% increase!)

Looking good so far. One skill in and we've multiplied our Damage an additional **360%** versus our base 7,645 Damage output.

Next, we'll add **25% Grenade Damage** with 5/5 Axton's Steady skill. Yes you read that right.

**TORGUE weapons benefit from BOTH Gun AND Grenade damage bonuses!**

* Splash Damage: 11,467 (50% increase!)
* Hit: 20,641 (270% increase!)
* Critical Hit: 29,814 (390% increase!)

Here is where the calculations become tricky. Due to TORGUE weapons receiving both Gun and Grenade damage bonuses, and TORGUE weapons dealing two **separate** instances of damage, one Gun and one Explosive, the % Damage multipliers start to be a bit skewed.

A quick tip: TORGUE guns are considered to be **ELEMENTAL** and do **not** receive either bonus Gun Damage or Fire Rate from Axton's Duty Calls skill.

Another **10% Grenade Damage** from 5/5 Axton's Do or Die skill.

* Splash Damage: 12,385 (62% increase!)
* Hit: 21,558 (282% increase!)
* Critical Hit: 30,731 (401% increase!)

A quick **5% Gun Damage and 5% Critical Hit Damage** from 5/5 Axton's Ranger skill.

* Splash Damage: 12,901 (69% increase!)
* Hit: 22,456 (294% increase!)
* Critical Hit: 32,967 (431% increase!)

An extra **26% Explosive Damage** from an Explosive Damage Relic.

* Splash Damage: 16,255 (113% increase!)
* Hit: 28,295(370% increase!)
* Critical Hit: 41,539 (543% increase!)

Grenadier Class Mod grants **31% Grenade Damage**.

* Splash Damage: 19,987 (261% increase!)
* Hit: 32,027 (419% increase!)
* Critical Hit: 45,271 (592% increase!)

Almost near the end here. We're already at a massive **592% damage increase!** We have one final skill to work into our TORGUE masterpiece, and that is 5/5 Axton's Battlefront skill. This grants an additional **30% Gun Damage and 30% Grenade Damage** as long as your turret remains active.

* Splash Damage: 29,263 (383% increase!)
* Hit: 44,192 (578% increase!)
* Critical Hit: 60,615 (793% increase!)

**Smokin' Jesus titty cinnamon! 793% DAMAGE INCREASE!**

Here it is fellow Vault Hunters. Our TORGUE pistol, our [7,645 Damage pistol](http://i.imgur.com/kBpO2.jpg), is dealing [60,615 Damage a shot!](http://i.imgur.com/ioH17.jpg) This was also done without any skill bonuses from the class mod, a white pistol, and zero baddass-rank bonuses. These numbers easily have the potential to be even higher. Consider TORGUE shotguns for example.

If you've made it this far, now you know. TORGUE weapons are badass. Go buy one right now. Seriously. Get to that vending machine ASAP.

Yay!**

For the lazy: The Dropbox link is [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/8990060/The_Aspiring_Vault_Hunters_Guidebook_To_BL2.pdf), and the MEGA link is [here](https://mega.co.nz/#!z1BUhBbQ!B-h3L2B4xZ2e42Z36nYjGwt2fZIk0t_N7rZMnoec-a4). I will not be putting up a Google Docs link, since all the hyperlinks and intra-links do not work when viewed in Google Docs.

This originally started as a UVHM FAQ, stemming off from my DLC guide in the sidebar, but people suggested so many things which I couldn't leave out that this rapidly turned into a game guide! It's relatively short, only 15 pages + a cover page, but hopefully it'll answer most of the more basic questions that many of you have. It's not intended to cover the most detailed nuances of game mechanics (save those in Numbers, because they confuse many people). This was made with the Steam Summer Sale in mind (i.e. more noobies looking for help on the basics, hence ""Aspiring"") though covers mechanics for all three platforms. 

It quickly became apparent that this was going to be too long to post directly to reddit. About 1/4 of the way in it was over the 10k character limit for a post, and in total would've needed the post itself and two, possibly three comments to contain it all, so I decided to scrap the reddit syntax and convert everything into a .pdf. It was at that point that I enlisted the help of the fantastic /u/ohenry78! He did pretty much everything other than write the guide, though he did make numerous small contributions (mostly things I forgot) that netted him co-author status. He did a fantastic job, and I am very happy to have had the opportunity to do this with him.

Some things to note about this guide:

* It's made so you can print it off. There is no hard-copy guide from Gearbox, so if you're interested you're free to do so.
* It contains no information on creatures/enemies; this will likely be included when the file gets updated when new DLC is released.
* The file is a .pdf hosted in my own dropbox account (edit: and now MEGA). As stated in the file, it is not to be re-hosted anywhere under any circumstances. I know dropbox isn't the best hosting medium but I will not take the file down, except to swap it for an updated version. It's also small enough to not go over the 20 GB/day bandwidth limit on my account, so shouldn't mysteriously disappear at any point.
* The entirety of the contents section is intra-linked within the document. Click on ""Character Selection"" and you'll be brought straight there! The same goes for any italicised mention of the various sections of the guide. This was entirely /u/ohenry78's doing, props!

So, hopefully this also goes down well. As one user said before it is nice to have a ""master thread"" to send people to, and this is it. It has enough info to get anybody started on the game, and provides more than a dozen links to different guides, infographics, and subreddits. feel free to download this and enjoy!

For the sake of it, here's a list of the Contents:

* Glossary of Terms and Acronyms. 
* Character Selection: A quick'n'dirty guide to each character's playstyle, key skills, and common level 61 builds. 
* Tips for Your First Playthrough, General Gameplay Tips.

I'll add more to that album later. Anyway, I was thinking something along the lines of an island that can only be found in the post-game (like Jurassic Park 2 with the island full of dinosaurs) with a mad scientist just recreating a few of these things. Also, add some cannibal villagers like from King Kong (2005 one) that would pretty much act like zombies, some Hyperion soldiers for a border patrol, and regular bandits who just want to play with the giant monsters/ use them to take over the world. Just think about psychos trying to wrangle a giant skag/ thresher thing or whatever the skull in that first pic belongs to.

I only use the word ""dinosaurs"" for lack of a better term. I don't mean like Tyrannosauruses and shit. I was thinking more along the lines of ""what came before the skags"" and ""what did that bigass skull belong to"" and ""what outlived the warrior""


Also, this would be a good chance to give some extra history for Pandora, ~~like maybe explaining why there are so many boats on mountaintops. Till then, I'll just go with my theory that Pandora is Earth and Borderlands is a sequel to Waterworld (the Kevin Costner movie from the 90's) where the water lowered.~~

&gt;Guaranteed Purple Drop chest + Easter Egg
&gt;
&gt;Alright guys, this is a compilation of info from the ""Volcano Secret?"" thread on the Spoilers section.

&gt;To gain access to the guaranteed purple drop chest, you have to:

&gt;-Go to Claptrap's Place

&gt;-Find the item in the fireplace

&gt;-Deliver the item to Geary, on the volcano in the Eridium Blight

&gt;*You cannot fast travel or die to get it to register

&gt;**Cars however ARE allowed

&gt;-Let Geary hit you once, and then he will jump off a cliff into the lava

&gt;*If he hits you more than once you failed at it and have to re-do it.

&gt;-Enjoy the 3 Rakk flying by overhead dropping loot chests, including the guaranteed purple drop chest!

&gt;If you're not seeing the reference, think Lord of The Rings and then maybe you'll understand.

&gt;Also, Geary can be farmed for purple rarity heads if you're into that stuff.

&gt;--Bonus--

&gt;Kunckledragger can be farmed for the Hornet since he's on the way

&gt;--Have Fun--

&gt;Many thanks to everyone who helped with finding all this out!

&gt;Happy Farming!

&gt;--Edit--

&gt;Thanks to thrasherv3 for reminding me, this has only been guaranteed to be accessible on PT2. There have been some cases of it working on PT1 (Post-warrior kill and multiplayer) but those have been iffy still.

&gt;Thanks to falconbox585 and friends for some further testing! This can be done as a group, however another player joining mid-trek nullifies the event, as the new person spawns from a New-U.

http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2012/09/18/game-theory-borderlands-2-fails-to-generate-joy-puke/

EDIT: By request, here is the full text of the article.

Ask me what I think about Borderlands 2 from Gearbox Software, and I’d tell you about its dubious, convoluted plot. I’d talk about a mind-boggling array of guns and loot. At no point, though, would I ever say I was ready to “joy puke” my face off, as the game box predicts players will do.

The sequel to the highly acclaimed 2009 Borderlands game goes on shelves Tuesday in Xbox 360, PS3 and PC versions for around $60. At that price point, the first-person shooter, published by 2K Games, inevitably invites comparisons with the Halos and Calls of Duty games already out and due to come in the next few weeks and months. Borderlands 2 falls short because it’s missing several key elements you need to have in a 2012 first-person shooter game – most notably, a rich multiplayer online mode. There’s an extremely limited four-player cooperative mode, and if you have an Xbox Live Gold account, you can team up that way, but this isn’t the type of deeply engrossing FPS game the headset-wearing COD crowds gather to play months and months after release. In comparison, I read on several sites that COD: Black Ops 2 will feature up to six teams, for a total of 18 simultaneous players, in multiplayer mode.

It’s apparent that Borderlands 2 is going after that testosterone-filled, 18-35-or-so demographic, with its over-the-top marketing verbiage (eg. “a bazillion weapons just got bazilliondier”), gratuitous cussing in the game and prominent placement of a pre-order advertisement on the ESPN.com homepage. I played the Xbox version of Borderlands 2 for close to a week, and while the development and upgrades from the original are apparent, the quirk and novelty that made the 2009 game so endearing and popular (according to VGChartz.com), combined unit sales of the original topped 4.5 million for the PS3, Xbox 360 and PC) feel dated and tired in this game.

Borderlands 2 doesn’t just bill itself as an FPS. It’s a space Western FPS or a role-playing shooter, with the ability to build and customize characters. The game’s premise is that you’re a loot hunter fighting to free the planet Pandora from the evil CEO of Hyperion Corp, Handsome Jack. The evil CEO wants to wipe out the planet’s ragtag population and turn Pandora into an industrial playground for his company. His presence is felt throughout the game by the hovering H-shaped space station that serves as his and Hyperion’s headquarters. In actual gameplay, you’re expected to fight your way across Pandora, hoping to stop Handsome Jack from awakening “the Warrior,” an alien even more evil than he is. The events in Borderlands 2 take place several years after the original game and are a continuation of those events, albeit with four new playable characters.

I had to go back to Wikipedia descriptions of the original game to remember all the intricate twists and turns of the Borderlands backstory, which involved a couple of mega-corporations, called Dahl Corp. and Atlas Corp. Atlas set up shop on Pandora one fine winter, hoping to find a vault filled with high-tech alien weapons after finding a similar one on a neighboring planet. Alas, Atlas didn’t realize what a hellhole Pandora was in summer, when horrifying alien monsters come out of hibernation, and abandoned the planet. Enter Dahl, which basically pillaged Pandora for the sake of mining its resources, using convict labor that it shipped in. Complicating the already complicated plot, a xeno-archaeologist working on Pandora while Dahl was in charge, actually did find the mysterious vault. When Atlas heard that, it sent in a private army to claim the vault. Dahl, doing what all brave corporations do when faced with imminent invasion, skedaddled, leaving behind the poor, huddled masses and convict labor on the monster-filled planet. The vault is uncovered at the end of the original Borderlands, but is resealed for another 200 years.

In this new game, in your battle against Handsome Jack and his minions and the Pandora monster aliens, you have your choice of playing as one of four protagonists – Axton the Commando, Salvador the so-called “Gunzerker,” Zero the Assassin, or Maya the Siren – each fully customizable in appearance and each displaying unique traits. The game’s opening sequence reminds you that Borderlands’ developers chose to go the animation route, and I don’t like it very much. The game isn’t manga-like enough to be super-hip, so instead, it just feels cartoonish. Menacing characters like Handsome Jack, who tries to you off in the opening sequence via a double-crossing explosion, are not at all fearsome. Your four heroes from the first game all appear as non-playable characters in this game. They are pretty cool in conception and rendering.

Also back is Claptrap, a droid that’s somewhat of a cross between a snarky, profane C3PO with the body of an R2D2. Claptrap acts as your guide, and is a fairly detestable character, who left me cold. When his camera eye got plucked out by an alien on the first mission, I didn’t care. Still, I had no choice but to go out and put my Zero character at risk to restore the loathsome droid’s sight.

Borderlands 2’s single-player campaign mode isn’t as good as what you’ll find in games like COD: Black Ops or the Medal of Honor series. There’s too much “feast-or-famine” hunting for tasks, supplies and a good battle for this to be a fun game all the way through.

I played with my 14-year-old son, and we found ourselves spending a lot of time mindlessly opening supply boxes and mailboxes to find bullets, health boosts and other goodies we didn’t really want or need yet. You also wander a lot in winter wastelands that are hard to find your way around, due to the cartoonish blockiness. The game’s mapping was detailed, though, and at first, it was fun to explore a bit. It became a nuisance later. I was reminded a couple of times of the desolate feeling you have on the road while playing Skyrim and struck by how long it took to get from one action point to another. Luckily, the developers built quick-travel machines into the game, allowing you short-circuit some of that boring travel time.

Controls are very similar to COD, which makes the game very familiar and easy to play right out of the box. Combat is definitely the best part of Borderlands 2, and when I found a good fight, I really got immersed. There were, however, too many interludes between pitched battles. The artificial intelligence of the aliens and other enemies in this game is excellent, and I found it hard to outsmart and outmaneuver them. I tried to outfox stone-throwing monsters by racing from one side of a sheltering shack to another, but they blew my strategy by simply coming at me from all sides, and in numbers. The best way to fight, I found, was to wade right in, blasting away with whatever weapons I had at hand.

The types of guns and sheer number of available weapons in Borderlands 2 is overwhelming. There are pistols, shotguns and automatic guns and lots of variations and accoutrements you can add to make them better or more deadly. Incendiary guns are a good way to stop other humanoid enemies, I found. In the early stages of the game, I was able to switch between two different weapons, and had to go into my backpack if I wanted to switch them out. Keeping an inventory of your weapons is a bit complicated as the game goes on, and I found myself holding onto too many guns that were too similar to each other to be of much use. Likewise, you can acquire or purchase better shielding for yourself.

There’s a “fight-for-your-life” mode that lets you get a “second wind” if you kill an alien before your life meter runs out. The game slows down and goes black-and-white during this mode, and aiming is slower and harder, so you’ll have to be deft to recover.

As a $30 impulse buy, priced about the same as games like “NASCAR Unleashed,” I wouldn’t have a problem recommending Borderlands 2 as a fun diversion. At twice that price, though, I think it’s fair for players to demand the whole magilla – cutting-edge development, engrossing campaign gameplay, scads of downloadable content, a rich social media/community experience, sharing of loot and gear and online multiplayer modes that keep you and your friends coming back until the next version of the game comes out.

And Borderlands 2 misses on enough counts so that I not only didn’t joy puke, I didn’t even get a tiny bit of mirthful bile in my throat. It may be the game for you, but if you’re in the market for a new FPS, I’d at least counsel waiting to compare it to Black Ops 2, due out in mid-November, or Halo 4, which is slated for a December release.",,False,self,t5_2r8cd,1347995567.0,,,True,t3_1036rj,http://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1036rj/wall_street_journal_review_of_bl2_completely/,

Maybe the problem isn't that the game is not good enough, but you've actually just reached the point of ""too much of a good thing"". Maybe those of us who feel dissatisfied just need a couple of months break. 

Why not go through BL1 again, or invest in a new game? Or check out an ""old"" series that is well known for being awesome? Mass Effect and Bioshock immediately come to mind.

I have now on four different occasion had my echo dialogue cut out or interrupted by an event in the game. This is horrible just plain damn horrible, he I am listening to the comic gold Gearbox has so pain stakingly woven together for my ears and it get interrupted by another echo or cut scene. And I can't go back and hear what I missed. 

One of the things that makes the Borderlands series so great is its dialogue and players are missing out, it's like a pizza with no sauce or a day on the internet with no cat post. 

Cast your minds back to the first game, would it have been as great without claptrap's interjections, General Knoxx's slow spiral of depressing monologues about how much his job sucks, or scooter's off color white trash comments. No I tell you good sir, no it wouldn't. 

 So you can see why when I miss dialogue my heart sinks because I know I have no way of hearing it again short of starting up a whole new game. It is like I have just been robbed of happiness and say it shouldn't be this way.

To any Gearbox employees reading this post I know you didn't do this on purpose but please hear my plead and try to correct this grievous error if not in 2 but please in 3. 

**Update 1**
Due to the overwhelming opinion on this subject I have fired off a contact request over to Gearbox via their website. I invited them to come over and give their 2 cents on the subject. Hopefully they can answer our question and maybe hear us out. So let's see where we can go with this and if they do show up, we all need to be **fair**. They may have an reasonable case for why the ECHO playback was cut out and let's not turn this into a giant grief cluster about things we don't like about the game. I personally would like an answer and like to know my concerns are heard, but if I get it, I am not going to stomp my feet if they say they can't or won't patch the playback into the game. **I know I am asking much here internet, but be nice.**

**Update 2**
Gearbox never got back with me.

I'm sure you've all seen these comments and posts. They outnumber the discussion posts 4:1. I'm so sick of seeing these posts constantly on the front page. Has this subreddit just turned into a complaint board? 


The drop rates: Why does everyone cry about this so much? I for one, dont want to find every fucking legendary in the game on my first character. So what if you never get an Infinity Pistol? Its a VERY useful gun, and the rarity proves it. The moment you do finally get one, you will be happy. Try farming Doc Mercy instead of wasting time bitching on this site. 


What good would it do to find all the legendaries? Is it fun to one-shot everything and be OP all the time? Does anyone enjoy a challenge?


The Bee nerf that everyone still wants to talk about: LET IT GO! The devs changed it, and so what? Its their creation and they have the right. So what if you cant kill Terramorphous in 10 seconds and have all his legendaries in an hour. Why do you want the loot to be that easy to get? Its fucking legendary gear, not pretty good, LEGENDARY. How would you feel if you spent YEARS of your life drawing a maze and someone cuts all the lines from start to finish, how would you feel? They don't want everyone to one-shot all their creations to get the rarest items in the game easily, and I don't blame them.


I hope that the incessant bitching never gets to Gearbox. If it was up to the user base, legendaries would drop in groups of 3 from enemies and your character would be invulnerable as you one hit everything at once.


Don't like farming for hours? Don't do it then. Weapons of legend don't just fall into the lap of the lazy person. Step up to the challenge, and lose the entitled attitude.

Right, so there's this book experiment I'm doing over at http://bozpublishing.com/ 

The idea behind the experiment is to serialize a book for free online (on the website) and see if I can monetize it a bit on the side by putting it up in eBook format on Amazon, etc after. It's broken up into seasons like a TV show, and we just moved into part three of the first season--the book is called ""The Returners."" It will always be free to read in its entirety on the website, but its nice to offer an option for people that want to support the idea.

In a nutshell (and hopefully spoiling little,) it's about historical figures that find themselves born again into the same bodies--just in modern times. It's a swiftly-paced, oftentimes pulpy story about people just trying to stay alive, even if they are the thirteen-year-old reincarnation of Albert Einstein. Oh, and there's an unhealthy obsession with tacos sprinkled throughout.

Feel free to ask me anything in the thread, and I can probably clear up any simple BLT (that's what I call Borderlands 2) question you may have as well. Or, any questions you have about simple sandwiches made from bacon, lettuce, and tomatoes. 

The idea is still in its infancy, so I'm attempting to gain some grassroots support from all of you awesome /r/Borderlands'ers. 

Follow me on twitter as @mikeyface for updates about the book, Borderlands, AliensCM, and every other crazy project I'm working on at the moment.

(Hope you guys checked out the news that a Borderlands comic, written by me, is coming from IDW. We have almost completed the first issue and it is insane.)

Should I get the season pass? | Yes.
What do I get with the Season pass? | Sir Hammerlocks, Pirates, Torgue ,UVHM and level 61, One more DLC that isn't announced yet
What doesn't come with the season pass? | No characters, mechromancer and psycho are not included, None of the player skin/head packs
Are the Characters worth the price? | Yes.
UVHM Is so hard! It's like, so hard it isn't even fun any more. It's so hard!!! | Yes, we know. Try playing more strategicly.
I haven't been getting lots of loot! Are drops random? | Yes loot is random, also no it's not just you RNG can be a bitch to everyone.

I just got a psycho item as a drop! | Yeah, everyone is getting them.
Can I repeat the DLC's? Do the DLC's reset when I reset UVHM? | Yes the DLC's reset when you reset UVHM, and you can repeat them only in UVHM.
I'm level 29 ish and this character class really sucks, why does this class exist if it's so lame and undistinguished? | Character classes rarely show their stuff until you've reached one of the endcap skills. Don't complain about it until you've killed the warrior at least once.
Savage Lee isn't dropping l00tz for me! | He doesn't drop the UKH, despite popular belief. Torgue DLC can help you get one with the Token system.
Doc Mercy's drop rate must be freaking low because I can't get the infinity!!! | Yeah, he doesn't drop it in TVHM. His loot tables are messed up. Only way to get it is from a completely random drop or from the Warrior, you can also go to UVHM and farm one there.
UVHM Is so difficult because I run out of AMMO all the time! | Well you are going to die anyways, so just get killed and you'll spawn with near full ammo and grenades. Research is being done to figure out when this is economicly efficient.

I'd like to start by saying that I'm a big Borderlands fan, but in addition to  that I am an avid builder of LEGO. Combining the two seemed in suit. Without further ado, I would like to present you with some of my builds:

Here is the situation my friend and I were in and after much googling,  research, and trial and error we have found out the exact steps to do it.

I have not seen this spelled out before anywhere, I just pieced together the information and fiddled around until I figured out how to make it work. My apologies if this is common knowledge.

You will need the following programs:

3. Make a new xbox profile, or use one that doesn't have a BL2 save on your xbox's hard drive.

4. Sign into this new profile on your xbox.

5. Start borderlands 2 on your xbox.

6. Start a new game and choose to save your data on your xbox hard drive.

7. While the into video is playing now time to do the steps on the pc.

8. Run ""Gibbed.Borderlands2.SaveEdit.exe"" which you unzipped earlier.

9. Click open, open: C:\Users\""Yourname""\Documents\My Games\Borderlands 2\WillowGame\SaveData\""909380982randomnumbers""\Save0001.sav

22. Select USB storage.

23. After it is done copying unplug it and plug it into your computer.

24. Sign into your main xbox profile.

25. Restart BL2.

26. Run ""Horizon"", I had trouble running it, I finally managed to run it by turning off my internet connection. After it starts, you can turn it back on. (If you have any problems running Horizon beyond this, I do not know how to fix it) It will tell you you are in offline mode, that is okay.

27. 2 windows will be open. On the smaller ""Device explorer"" window, turn down the ""Games"" arrow, then the ""Borderlands 2"" Arrow.

28. Drag this save game into the main window.

29. Click the ""contents"" tab.

30. Right click on the ""SaveGame.sav"" entry. Click ""replace""

Contributions are welcome, of course.

edit: Added that you can spawn him in the Natural Selection Annex, provided you don't turn in the round where the Ultimate Badass enters the ring. 

**1. So what exactly is Vermivorous anyway?**

Vermivorous is the final stage in Varkid evolution: he emerges from a Supreme Badass Pod, and will never be seen in Normal Mode (Playthrough 1). Picture a varkid the size of a small house with legs as thick as your torso. Now picture it relentlessly chasing you all over the map.

**2. Holy f\*cksh\*t! I'm not going to accidentally come across this thing, am I?**

It's unlikely, but it could happen, especially if you're playing with other people. The evolution chance tables below (~~stolen~~ taken from the Gearbox forums) should give you an idea of the chances a varkid will evolve. (Chubby Varkids are counted as Badass Varkids, and are included in the tables).

| Evolve chance PT1 | 1-Player | 2-Player | 3-Player | 4-Player |
| :-- | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| Larval → Adult | 60% | 70% | 80% | 90% |
| Adult → Badass | 30% | 40% | 50% | 60% |
| Badass → Super | 10% | 20% | 30% | 40% |
| Super → Ultimate | 0% | 1% | 2% | 3% |
| Ultimate → Supreme | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% |

| Evolve chance PT2.5 | 1-Player | 2-Player | 3-Player | 4-Player |
| :-- | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| Larval → Adult | 70% | 80% | 90% | 100% |
| Adult → Badass | 40% | 50% | 60% | 70% |
| Badass → Super | 20% | 30% | 40% | 50% |
| Super → Ultimate | 10% | 20% | 30% | 40% |
| Ultimate → Supreme | 7.5% | 10% | 11% | 12% |
| Larval → Supreme | 0.042% | 0.24% | 0.7128% | 1.68% |
| Larval → Supreme | 1:2381 | 1:417 | 1:141 | 1:60 |

For the most part, though, you'll probably be actively trying to get him to show up before you see him.

As a note, you'll see that the final evolution stage is still pretty low in four-player mode - only 4.5% more likely than in solo. The biggest difference is that the earlier evolutions are *much* more common. If you're playing solo, an average sample of 100 varkids will result in 6 Super Badasses, one of which, if you're lucky, will evolve into an Ultimate Badass. The same size group in 4-player mode would give you, on average, 35 Super Badasses, 14 of which would evolve into the Ultimate form, with probably one going on to evolve into Vermivorous (or two, on a good day!). 

**3. Why would I want to try and get him to show up, exactly?**

For the thrill of the hunt, of course!

Also, Vermivorous has a chance to drop Legendary [XYZ] Class Mods for each character, as well as the Legendary grenade mod Nasty Surprise, and the legendary Maliwan rocket launcher Norfleet. While you can get the Nasty Surprise and Legendary Class Mods from any suitable loot source, it's important to note that the Norfleet is a Unique weapon, and as such, it will *not* be found in chests, vending machines, or slot machines (though it can drop from Hyperius the Invincible). He also drops a neat head customization for each class that you can't get from any other legitimate source!

**4. Okay cool, I'm up to the challenge. So where do I spawn him?**

The easiest and most popular location is the Tundra Express Farmhouse, which conveniently enough has a fast travel location you can use to go to the other Fast Travel and visit the ammo vending machine. The Farmhouse is located in the northwest corner of Tundra Express. To activate the Fast Travel, you'll need to climb into the barn next to it with the hole in the roof in order to deactivate the electrical barrier. From there, you can enter the farmhouse, jump down into the basement, and activate the Fast Travel beacon. There is another fuse box next to the ladder to deactivate the electric barrier next time you travel there. Staying inside the farmhouse is ideal, since it provides a lot of cover from everything except the Badass Varkids, who can still spit powerful attacks through the windows and doorway.

The Caustic Caverns is the other location. It doesn't provide a convenient shelter like the farmhouse, though if you can get varkids engaged in battle with a crystalisk, they'll evolve just the same as if you were fighting them. Varkids won't kill the crystalisk, since they can't seem to target their critical locations, and any varkid past the adult stage will easily survive the crystalisk's attacks if it's going to evolve.

There is a third area you can find him, located in the Natural Selection Annex (accessed through the Wildlife Exploitation Preserve), for those who either purchased it or pre-ordered BL2 at GameStop. During one of the rounds, an Ultimate Badass Varkid will enter the arena during the final wave. Farming Vermivorous here of course would mean you can't turn in the mission, so either you would have to save and quit, or deliberately die in order to try it multiple times. This method will probably be most effective for single players, since getting a varkid to the Ultimate stage can be a major upheaval in solo mode. Teams of four (or those playing in 4-player mode) would likely be better off choosing one of the two above areas, as the odds of getting multiple Ultimate Badasses in a single location are fairly good.

**5. And how do I force him to spawn?**

Here's the tricky part. You can't really ""force"" him to spawn. When a varkid first spawns, it has a set limit in how far it will go down the evolution chain. Once it reaches that limit, nothing you do will make it pod up and evolve again.

In order to evolve, Varkids DO NOT:

* Need to be shot. Shooting them *is* a good way to keep them focused on you, especially at the Ultimate stage: otherwise they can end up flying off, never to be seen again. But shooting the ground in the farmhouse repeatedly will be just as effective as shooting the varkids themselves.
* Need to have allies present. More varkids obviously means more chances to evolve, but a lone larval varkid can evolve as far as its evolutionary limit will permit, regardless if there are other Varkids around. Similar to this, the ""family tree"" idea that having X amount of varkids at a particular evolution level will *guarantee* that at least one of them evolves is nonsense.

Varkids DO:

* Need to be combat-active. That's it. As long as you keep them distracted (i.e. they're showing up on your minimap as a red dot), if they have not reached their maximum evolutionary stage, they *will* morph, given enough time. This will happen regardless of what you do, provided you (a) keep them in combat, and (b) don't kill them.

**6. How do I know if a varkid is at its evolutionary limit?**

Varkids have a reliable timer you can use before deciding whether or not to kill them. 

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| :-- | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| **Varkid level** | Larval | Adult | Badass | Super | Ultimate |
| **Time to pod (seconds)** | 10 | 20 | 30 | 60 | 120 |

Any varkid that hasn't built its pod within this time limit can be safely killed. These timers start when the varkid becomes combat-active. The timers will start over from 0 if the varkid leaves combat, then enters combat again later. If you're farming in the Tundra Express Farmhouse, you can use the arrival of the Buzzards as an indicator: if you haven't gotten an Ultimate Badass to build a Supreme Badass Pod by that point, it's quicker to just cut your losses, quit to the main menu, and try again.

**7. So what do I need to kill him?**

First off, you DON'T need the Blood of Terramorphous relic, as it does not effect varkid evolution (the health regeneration is nice if you want it for that, but that's all). All varkids, except badasses, are vulnerable to fire damage, so a couple good fire weapons are necessary. You'll want a powerful corrosive weapon to deal with the Badasses. Moxxi's weapons are ideal due to their healing factor. An Adaptive shield will help keep you alive longer, and The Bee will help take down the more powerful forms, provided you can stay in cover. You should avoid Nova and Spike shields, as they can kill larval and blood varkids (and a little potential Vermi) pretty easily. For this same reason, you should avoid using skills that can passively harm your enemies, such as Maya's Recompense and Backdraft. Lastly, an Infinity pistol, while not strictly necessary, is useful in making sure varkids keep attacking you, since you won't have to worry about running out of ammo. 

If you're lucky enough to find an Infinity with a caustic element effect, that would be ideal, since it doubles as an ammo-saver and an effective weapon against the Badass Varkids (you *will* go into FFYL multiple times, and the Badasses are usually the ones closest to you when you do, so not needing to reload can quite literally be a life-saver).

**8. I'm on console and I'm playing solo / not in a party of 4. Is there any way to increase the odds of Vermivorous showing up?**

There is, if you have the Captain Scarlett DLC. The game will put you in four-player difficulty once you visit The Engineer's Ring or Gee's Arena, and will keep you at that difficulty until you quit to the main menu. You can use this exploit to get 4-player varkid evolution rates simply by walking up to their gates, without even needing to pay the Eridium toll (walk by the vendors by Hyperius's gate in Washburne Refinery; walking up against the gate in Hayter's Folly and getting the Gee's Arena text to show up will also activate 4-player mode). An easy way to tell if you've done it correctly is by mass-picking up ammo: if you're picking up ammo even if you're already full, you're in 4-player mode. Of course this trick works on PC as well, but PC players also have access to the difficulty sliders.

Personally, those kind of problems are the last thing on my mind right now - I'm more caught up in the ""holy crap there's so much new material"" mentality.

Let's take a look at the most recent update - we got a level cap increase to 61, a third playthrough, a way to spend roughly 1000 Eridium, more inventory space, and several significant bug fixes. The level cap increase has been something that we've been clamoring about for MONTHS. We're now allowed to go up to 61, which is an excellent number in that we can unlock two capstones. The third playthrough is already being lauded on this subreddit as challenging and fresh, especially with the buff to Slag in PT3. The new gear is crazy, and is actually easier to get (at least farming Legendary Loot Midgets is more effort than the Evil Smasher glitch).

Speaking of which, they fixed some really major bugs. Evil Smasher was game-breaking, as was the Vladof infinite ammo glitch. Gearbox has listened to nearly every complaint and suggestion over the last few months, and has responded to them excellently. As if that weren't enough, we're getting *a sixth Vault Hunter* in just a few months (about the time when people have thoroughly explored all the new material) and another DLC which is promised to be the biggest yet.

I'm not suggesting that we ignore bugs, issues, and QOL improvements, but instead that we gain some perspective. I, for one, was not expecting how much new content would actually come out, and think that we should show some appreciation to Gearbox. They've done a great job handling the hundreds of suggestions and complaints from the community, and we should keep that in mind before continuing to give feedback on the new material.

**TL;DR** - We got a ton of shit really quickly and should show some appreciation for it, but we should also keep giving constructive criticism to make the game even better.",,False,self,t5_2r8cd,False,,gaige,True,t3_1blulw,http://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1blulw/lets_take_a_moment_to_appreciate_gearbox/,

The problem isn't that ""something is powerful, so it needs to be fixed"".

Very simply, allow players to swap out weapon components for eridium on the black market.  It sucks finally getting a gun you want, but you just wish it had this other type of scope.  I can't see anything game breaking about charging a hefty amount of eridium to have the scope changed.  Since the weapon components slightly alter the way the gun handles, it makes sense to allow the players to change them for a price.

Maybe they would want to avoid the changing accessories, or maybe just make it incredibly expensive to do so.  But if they are going to make farming that Hellfire take so long, you shouldn't be forced to use a bladed version if you aren't playing melee, and you shouldn't have to farm it again.

This doesn't even necessarily mean that everyone would just end up with the same gun.  I know, for example, that most people would prefer the Twin Hornet if they could choose, but I personally prefer the Close Quarters Hornet on my Zero (I also have a Twin).  It reloads faster, has better accuracy to let me use it from longer range, and the melee bonus is useful.  It fits my playstyle more.

Having this in the game would let people really play around with different gun components and find what works best for them, as well as reducing the repetitive farming for that *particular* version of the gun.",,False,self,t5_2r8cd,False,,,True,t3_1fqkf7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1fqkf7/a_use_for_eridium_that_i_would_love_to_see/,

Legendary items dropping from specific bosses. What is the point of 87 bazillion guns if everyone is going to kill the same set of enemies for the same set of items?

2. The new white to purple rarirty system. Previously, rarity was a combination of every part of a weapon, from the barrel to the material. Now, rarity just determines the material, and a better material is a fixed boost to every stat. Overall, this means that a purple weapon is always better than an equivalent blue, blue is always better than green, ect. 

3. Not really a downgrade but more a shortfall of one of the upgrades. Explosive bonus damage isn't listed in the same way elemental bonus damage is.

4. Bank and backpack storage is now more limited. What am I supposed to do with my 87 bazillion guns? If the data is stored clientside, why even bother with having any limit on bank space at all?

5. Again, another complaint about the upgrades. Eridium seems like it is an unfinished feature, considering it can barely be used on anything.

6. UI for the inventory is worse, considering only 8 storage slots can be seen at once. Previously this was closer to 20.

7. EDIT: The class mod appearances are, quite frankly, really pathetic. Just 4 models with a dozen different textures each? Previously there were separate left side, center side and right side parts, with thousands of combinations of appearance and textures.

It may seem like I really hate the new weapon generation system. I don't. I just feel that while they have gone 2 steps forwards, they have also taken a step back.

People complained that the only differences between weapons in BL1 were all very tiny, slight changes in numbers. Now, in BL2, the only changes are massive fundamental differences in the weapons, but this means that the number of weapons actually possible has decreased greatly. The best system would combine the massive differences (getting shotguns you can lob like grenades and have quadruple barrels) with the subtle variations (It also has a stock that increases accuracy slightly at the cost of some damage).",,False,self,t5_2r8cd,1349644215.0,,,True,t3_113h31,http://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/113h31/while_there_have_been_many_improvements_between/,

Not just in this game, but everything. But in particular, this applies to BL2.

Many of the bosses in the game have completely unavoidable attacks. Terramorphous is notorious for his super stretchy tentacle smacks that either almost kill you or knock you off the edge.

The new raid bosses also have this. At least the first one does.

No matter what you do, you cannot avoid it. I hate unavoidable attacks with a passion in any game.

Now you're probably thinking ""Stop moaning it's good that he's hard!""

I'm not moaning, don't get me wrong. I love difficult bosses. **But I love difficult bosses with skill ceilings.**

Let's take an example from Dark Souls. Extremely hard game, but completely skill based. You can get one hit, but you can avoid attacks if you have the timing right.

The way I see it, if they're going to have unavoidable attacks in the game, at least give a way to lower the damage recieved from each attack.

In the example of one of the new bosses, his attack deals the same damage no matter where you are, essentially making his ""Second phase"" of leaping around doing it pointless, because you still get hit either way.

You should instead take more damage the closer you are to him.

Well this year, I did a complete overhaul of an old custom class idea for BL1 and decided to make her the focus of the character. So I present to you all:

[Asha, the Beastmaster](http://i.imgur.com/rqkENAa.png)

The basis of the class is simple. It is a literal pet class. I know we technically have one already with Gaige, and to a lesser extent Axton, but this was something I always wanted to see. 

Each tree focuses on one aspect of the class, however all three mix in occasionally. *Beauty's Beasts* focuses mainly on the Pet, *Wild Child* focuses mainly on ramping up Asha's power, and the *One for All* tree gives buffs to your entire party. I tried to use all the existing in game skills of our six existing characters to balance things out, but some things may still be a little under/over powered.

I really wanted the pet to be a very heavy focus, so you'll notice throughout all three tress the pet skills are very powerful. You'll also notice that unlike a majority of the BL2 classes, there is a very heavy weapon focus on SMG's and Pistols. Considering that technically the character is a little girl, I thought that it would make sense for small arms fire to be more prevalent than her carrying around a rocket launcher bigger than herself. 

Originally there was also an extensive back story and a set of class mods for this post as well, but due to computer troubles over the last week and a half, they were never finished. If there's enough interest, I can get those finished and post them up here as well. 

Thank you for your time.

That % increase scales with level.  **lvl 20: 13% | level 44: 50% | level 61: 77,6%**

**So after level 44 if you equip a weapon with a blade attachment that gives you 50% increased melee damage you would actually do LESS damage** than if you were using weapon with no blade attachment.
But if you equip the Law (100% increased melee damage) you will be doing higher melee damage.
____

* **Buzz Axe Rampage**

Base cooldown: 120 seconds. **Duration 16 seconds** 

Melee damage bonus is **multiplicative**.

The cooldown is reduced **by 1 second for every 3.5% of his BASE health lost**.

This cooldown reduction is 4 times less effective if the damage is done to his shields instead of his health.

This also works with self inflicted damage.

It is irrelevant what weapon you have in hand when you activate this skill.

_____
***Mania***

* **Pull the Pin**

This activates when you die, not when you go in Fight for your Life mode.

If you kill an enemy with it you will be notified when you respown.

Longbow grenades do not teleport, they explode from the location of your body.

* **Salt the Wound**

You constantly lose 1 stack per second.

_____
***Hellborn***

Default self ignition duration: 5 seconds.

* **Elemental Elation**

**You can gain no more than 1 stack per second.**

You start losing stacks after 2 seconds of not doing elemental dot damage and you lose 2 stacks per second.

* **Fire Fiend**

Axes thrown in Buzz Axe Rampage are on fire and can set enemies on fire.

_____
***Bloodlust***

Elemental Status Effect Damage grants stacks of Bloodlust, this makes elemental weapons and grenades very effective at building stacks.

By default you start losing stacks after 1 second of not dealing damage.

The rate of decay varies, the more stacks you have, the quicker they decay.

It takes 46 seconds to go from 100 to 0 stacks.


* **Buzz Axe Bombardier**

Does an additional 100% of the base damage of an thrown Axe as explosive damage.

 The damage of the explosion is not affected by melee damage bonuses but it is affected by explosive damage bonuses.

The explosion can easily damage multiple enemies and it's triggered when the axe hits any surface.

____
***Zero***
____

* **Deception** 

Action Skill. Press button to create a holographic decoy and vanish for a few seconds**(6 seconds)**. 

The longer you are invisible the more Damage your next attack deals, but ending invisibility sooner causes your next deception cooldown to refresh faster **(minimum cooldown of 10 seconds before cooldown reduction)**. Maximum Cooldown 15 seconds.

**A minimum of  230%** up to +650% Melee Damage

**A minimum of 40%** Up to +200% Gun Damage

~~Up to +250% Gun Critical Hit Damage~~

Lies. **Deception does not give any Critical him damage increase** at all, it simply increases gun damage by up to 200% before the [critical hit multiplier of the weapon](http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Critical_hit_%28Borderlands_2%29).
I think this text it there to remind you that maybe you should try to land a critical hit with the deception damage bonus.

_____
***Bloodshed***

* **Killing blow**

 **""low on health""** ? - When below **30% health**.

The damage bonus from this skill is multiplicative rather than additive, that is why you get astronomical numbers when using it.

* **Execute**

How much exactly is this **""massive damage""** ?

This skill changes the melee damage bonus of deception from 

A minimum of 230% up to 650% Melee damage to

**A minimum of 460% up to 1400% increased Melee damage**

* **Many must fall**

Fully refreshes Death blossom every time you succeed.

**+ 2 seconds** on the duration of deception per kill.
_____

***Cunning***

* **Counter Strike**

It is activated by any enemy attack that is not damage over time.

* **Ambush**

You get the bonus if enemies are targeting your decoy, in fact if you are in deception you are getting the bonus damage no matter what.

* **Unforeseen**

Additional decoys can be created by **Many must fall explode**

* **Death Mark**

The damage bonus is **multiplicative.**

* **Death Blossom**

You throw 4 daggers at a time and you can do that 5 times. They can have any of the 5 elemental types. 

To apply **Death mark** you have to directly hit an enemy, the elemental explosions do not apply it.

___
***Sniping***

* **Kill Confirmed**

It takes **~ 2.7 seconds** to get the full bonus.

* **Critical Ascension**

You start losing stacks after **6 seconds.**

You lose 1 stack Per second.

Switching weapon, opening a menu(map, inventory, quest log, etc), using a vending machine, talking to a quest giver and dieing instantly removes all stacks.

___

***Gaige***
___

* **Summon Deathtrap**

60 seconds cooldown, 60 seconds duration. Time between melee attacks - 1.5 seconds.
___
***Ordered Chaos***

* **Robot Rampage**

**Cooldown - 13 seconds.**

Misleading tooltip. It's not 7 attacks, it's  **9+1 attacks**.

DT spins for 2 seconds dealing 9 attacks to all enemies near him. Each of those 9 attacks does 62% of his normal melee attack damage.At the end of his spin he does an instant normal attack with no delay for full damage.

In other words, with this skill deathtrap does up to **658%** of his melee damage in 2 seconds.

* **Discord**

Cost - **1.33 stacks per second.**

* **Death from Above**

Cooldown - 2 seconds.

Shooting while walking on uneven surfaces or getting hit by bullets and getting lifting inches off the ground can result  in unwanted activaton of this skill. 

* **The Nth Degree**

**Do NOT invest more than one point in this skill.**

In the best case scenario (if there are always enemies in range) you will get 11.1% damage increase from 1 point in this skill. 
Investing 4 more skill points you will only increase that bonus to 20%. 

Because of this investing more than 1 is a waste of skill points.

* **With Claws**

At the cost of 1 Anarchy stack you do 2 swipes, both doing full melee damage and both healing you for % of your missing heath.

At 1% heath this skill heals for up to ~**30%** of your heath per swipe. At 90% health it will heal for ~5% of your health.

Also important to note is that because of both swipes do full melee damage and the speed at which you can use this attack this skill effectively gives you **50%  increased melee attack speed.**

___
***Little Big Trouble***

* **The Stare**

**Cooldown - 15 seconds.**

Damage not affected by Evil Enchantress or badass rank bonuses.

* **Shock Storm**

Can activate Electrical burn even if created by Deathtrap.

* **One Two Boom**

**Cooldown - 42 seconds.**

* **Interspersed Outburst**

First stack after **2 seconds** of not shooting.

Full stacks after **9.3 seconds** of not shooting.

**The damage is based on character level and the number of stacks only.** It will do the same damage with 1 or 5 points invested.
**The chance to slag is 2% per rank for each stack.** So with 5 stacks at rank 5 the chance to slag is 50%.

***Make It Sparkle***

Each of his melee attacks does additional damage equal to **2x** his base melee damage.

Because it takes the base damage and not the actual damage Strength of 5 Gorillas, Upshot Robot and Made of Stern Stuff do not increase the elemental damage his melee attacks do.

The elemental damage he does is also affected by the elemental damage type multipliers. So for example if Deathtrap does 1000 damage with his melee attacks and you set him on fire and send him after a fleshy target, he will deal 1000 normal damage + 3500 fire damage per melee attack.

**But there is more, this thing works with Robot Rampage and that combination is absolutely  phenomenal.**

This is because it does the full bonus elemental damage on each attack.

Let me toss some numbers at you.

At level 61 Deathtrap does 136k damage with his melee attack. If I send him with no upgrades vs a Super Badass Loader he will do 272k damage in 2 seconds.

If he has Make it Sparkle and Robot Rampage and I you give him corrosive attacks he will do:

895k damage normal damage + 3133k corrosive damage in 2 seconds.

**So from 272k to 4027k damage.**

And if you slag that enemy for him, he can do over **12 million damage in 2 seconds.**  Scary.
___
***Best Friends Forever***

* **Buck Up**

**Cooldown - 18 seconds.**

* **Explosive Clap**

**Cooldown - 25 seconds.**

* **Sharing is Caring**

Deathtrap does not benefit from the special effect of Amp Shields.

Spike, Nova, Roid and Booster work as you would expect.

Absorb shields do not give you ammo, I can't tell if they are protecting DT from bullets.

Don't have a way of testing if Turtle shields reduce his heath or do adaptive shields boost his health and resistances.

___

***Maya***
___
* **Phaselock**

By default it lasts **5 seconds**
___
***Cataclysm***

* **Flicker**

It increases the chance to apply an elemental effect that the weapon has by said %.

(example, weapon has 40% chance to ignite, with 5 points in this skill it will become 52% chance to ignite)

* **Helios**

It also applies on targets that cannot be Phaselocked.

* **Ruin**

It creates 3  explosions with the center being the phaselocked target. Slag, Electric and Corrosive explosion in that order. Works on targets that cannot be phaselocked.

___
***Harmony***

* **Life tap**

Instantly restores health equal to x% of any damage you do. Works with  guns, rocket launchers, grenades, melee attacks, damage over time effects, any damage you do.

* **Scorn**

Sends out a slow moving orb that explodes on impact doing minor slag damage. While flying the orb also sends out slag tendrils to all enemies around it, quickly applying the slag debuff to them.

Very reliable  way of applying slag to multiple enemies.

___
***Motion***

* **Kinetic Reflection**

You can become immune to bullets if I have 10 points in to this skill ?

* **Sub-Sequence**

Once the phaselocked target dies the spell starts moving the same way homing grenades do and seeks another target.

While the spell is moving to another target the duration of phaselock keeps going down. Also when its seeking another target Wreck, Elated and Chain reaction are not active.

Every time it hits a new target Converge, Helios and Ruin are reapplied.

* **Thoughtlock**

Converge, Helios, Wreck,Ruin, Chain reaction and Elated work with Thoughtlock.

___
***Salvador***
___

* **Gunzerking**

By default this skill lasts 20 seconds and provides 33.3% damage reduction.

___
***Brawn***

* **I'm the Juggernaut**

At 5 points the 20% damage reduction you are supposed to get is more like ~16.5%. It's a great skill nonetheless.

When combined with **Gunzerking** it results in 41% damage reduction.

* **Fistful of Hurt**

**300%** increased melee damage (multiplicative).

* **Come At Me Bro**

The buff lasts **8 seconds** and it increases the damage reduction to **66.6%**. 

When combined with **I'm the Juggernaut**(5 points) it results in  ~ 71% damage reduction.

___
***Rampage***


* **Get Some**

It is important to note that this skill also works while you are **Gunzerking**, this means that by the time your Gunzerking timer runs out you might have it off cooldown and ready to be used again immediately.


* **Keep Firing...**

You just have to keep your finger on the triggers, lift them for more the 1 second and the magic is gone.

It takes about 10 seconds to get the maximum bonuses.

____
***Gun Lust***

* **All I Need is One**

Best thing about this skill is that it works with rocket launchers.

* **Money Shot**

Does not work with Rocket Launchers. 

No all that great when using TORGUE weapons because of the way explosive weapon damage is calculated.

With 5 points in the skill the damage bonus for **clip size** is as follows:

1 = 0% (You sttil hear the sound, but there is no bonus damage)

2 = 80%

3 = 120%

4 = 160%

5 = 200%

6 = 240%

7 = 280%

8 = 320%

9 = 360%

10 = 400%

**11 = 440%!**

**12+ = 480%!**

Yes, the optimal clip size is actually 12.


* **No Kill Like Overkill**

How does it work ?

It works exactly as it says, however the bonus damage you can get is capped. 

The cap is 5x as much damage as you would do with no overkill bonus. That damage bonus is multiplicative and is applied at the end of the equation.

Whatever damage you can do without the overkill bonus you can do up to 5 times as much damage with the overkill bonus, as long as you follow the same rules.

For example if you can hit a slagged target for 100k damage with the bonus from ""All I need is one"" and ""Money Shot"" and no Overkill bonus, then with maximum overkill bonus damage you should be able to hit a target for 500k, as long as it is also slagged and you have the ""all I need is one"" and ""Money shot"" bonuses.

___
***Axton***
___

* **Sabre Turret**

How long does it last by default ?

23 seconds, but because it takes some time to deploy and start shooting its **20 seconds** at best.  Also by default it fires 8 rounds per burst.

___

***Gunpowder***

* **Steady**

This skill states that it increases grenade damage, that is true, but that bonus grenade damage also applies to the explosive round of TORGUE weapons and Tediore reload explosions.

* **Do or die**

Same thing as **Steady.**

* **Battlefront** 

Same as the two above, but it also gives gun damage, that means that TORGUE weapons double dip with this skill for a massive damage increase.

* **Nuke**

Not affected by any damage bonuses other then the slag and Death Mark damage multipliers.

____
***Guerrilla***

* **Scorched Earth**

Equipping your turret with rocked pods also decreases the damage the gun of the turret does by **13%**
 
* **Double Up**

This upgrade also decreases the turret gun damage by **13%**. This results in a **74%** increased damage  for having 2 guns rather than the 100% increase that you would expect. 

If you combine this with rocket pods then you will be only getting **54%** increased turret gun damage.

All of that does not mean that rocket pods are not worth it.

This special effect overrides the mechromancer's loss of accuracy when stacking anarchy but keeps the improved damage. The Law is also incredibly useful for gaining anarchy stacks- it has the low magazine size of a revolver, plus if the Law spawns with an ""ornery"" prefix, it will have an amazing base reload speed of 1.7. All this combines to make an insanely hard hitting gun with an insanely high rate of fire that will give you anarchy stacks ridiculously fast.

 **HEY! MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD! YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!**



Spoilers starting here! 
Don't read! Seriously! Spoilers coming up!


**SNAPE KILLS DUMBLEDORE**

So I'd just like to start some discussion about the various lore questions that are left with us after completing Borderlands 2, like why doesn't Jack just stop you from respawning, and why doesn't Roland respawn after being shot?

**Why doesn't Jack stop you from respawning?**

There are many reasons for this. The first is obviously that he needs you to reach sanctuary, encounter Wilhelm, get the power core so that Angel can lower the shields.
Secondly, after listening to some of the unused audio I found this from Angel:

""I hope this didn't hurt too much. Think of me like a safety net. I took the liberty to uploading your DNA to a new-u station here on Pandora. Not everyone on the planet can afford this luxury, so be aware that this will cost you money everytime you die.""

This means she can control the new-u station (like she can control most systems on Pandora), and probably means that she overrides Jack's command to disallow the hunters from respawning.

Finally, Jack wants to kill you himself. He removes the bounty on your head, and tries to kill you at the end.

So that accounts for why you still respawn. At first, it's because Jack needs you, then it's probably Angel working against Jack, and finally, Jack who wants to kill you himself.

Diving into the unused audio some more also reveals some funny lines, given by Jack when reviving at a New-U station:

""This is hillarious! I own the machine that just respawned you, so everything you die you're actually paying me. Wait, is that ironic, or is that one of those thing you think is ironic but actually isn't? Like a cripple doing standup? I don't know.""

""OH MY GAHD! HAhaaha! There goes again, oh shit! You're such an idiot! Thank you so much!""

""I'm considering going 'Ka-ching' right now but that would be really immature, so, lets just say that by 10% of what you just paid me by dying, I could cure universal hunger. But no, that money was better spent reviving you.""

""KA-CHING! Crap, I totally said I wasn't going to do that and I did it anyway!""

""All this dying you're doing, I can even imagine how you're going to take me down. Thing going as they are I might just spend the next few weeks killing and reviving you just to amuse myself. That'll be fun, won't it?""

He has a few more lines about how hilarious it is that you are dying. He also eat pretzels.
So going from this, apparently Jack also get a kick out of watching you die. He mentions to you that he stabs Lillith again and again while she is his captive, so... yeah... Phsycopath, check.

This also takes out the mystery of why Roland actually dies. Angel probably protected them (perhaps), but when she died, it's game over for the original Vault hunters.


**Why are everyone so afraid of Wilhelm, when you managed to take him down easy as pie?**

I haven't heard this in-game, but in the voice files, Jack has this to say:

""Shame that Wilhelm had to let you kill him. Heck of a soldier -- not many people would volunteer to die, just so you'd think I didn't want you to have that power core. But -- psst -- spoilers: I did.""

""So, Wilhelm nearly killed your Vault Hunter friends a couple years ago, and you just blow him away like any other grunt? Yeah, that's cause I poisoned him before you guys fought. Worth it, though, to make you think I didn't want you to have that power core. But -- psst -- spoilers: I did.""

So yeah, to dismiss the theory that Saturn is actually Wilhelm, Wilhelm is Wilhelm. Mind blown?


**Is Captain Flynt related to Baron Flynt?**

In an (unused?) audio, file Captain Flynt has this to say:

""I'm still offering a reward for whoever brings me the head of the man or woman who murdered my brother, Baron. Yes, his name was Baron. It wasn't a title. Our parents were douchebags.""


**Why does not Jack Respawn after you killing him?**

I have no idea. Anyone?

1362388039.0,325,self.Borderlands,19mp2z,I don't want to fight one corporation in BL3. I want to fight all of them! (and other thoughts),Imploder,395,70,104,http://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/19mp2z/i_dont_want_to_fight_one_corporation_in_bl3_i/,"I've had all sorts of ideas about BL3. And I've shared a few of them in some comment threads. This is a wishful fan theory of mine, that I just want to put out there, and get your thoughts. 

The main thing I would like to see introduced into BL3 is choice. While BL is a fairly open world, with lots of different things to do and see, the narrative is pretty linear. About the only moment I can recall in either game where the player was a deciding factor in the story telling is the mission where you're trying to save Roland. If you are unable to down the constructor boss in enough time, he travels to The Friendship Gulag and you have to save him there instead of at the Ramparts. Otherwise, its a pretty straight forward experience. 

So lets talk for a second about where we're at after the end of BL2. 

**MAJOR SPOILER ALERT**

Its discovered that there are lots of other Vaults in the universe. Roland, Angel, and Jack are dead. The remaining Vault Hunters are planning their next move. 

So here we go: Jack is dead, but he's left an unforeseen, and very dangerous legacy. Jack was able to gain an incredible amount of power and influence and basically take over an entire planet with a Siren under his thumb. When its discovered that Angel is a Siren, the other Corporations take notice. 

Now we know that there can only be six Sirens in the universe at a time. We know of four of the six (Lillith, Maya, Angel and Steel). Angel and Steel are dead. So we've got two on the way, and two unaccounted for. 

An arms race has begun. All of the corporations want their own Siren. And with two young ones out their in the universe, they're easy pickings once they're found. Lillith and Maya, having both had their abilities exploited do not want this to happen to these little girls. In addition, the thought of another corporation gaining the kind of power Hyperion was able to achieve doesn't sit well with them. Lillith and Maya set out to find these young girls before the other corporations can. Fighting them all along the way. In various environments and locals (different planets... SPACE!). That takes the fight off Pandora and makes the BL universe an even bigger place. Each corporation has its own champion that will eventually be a boss. You could have a lot of fun with this. The Jacobs boss could be a grizzled gun slinger. Vladoff could have a massive Russian brawler covered in gatling guns. Tedior could have a fast moving teleporting ninja. Maliwan could have one of the two Sirens yet unaccounted for with crazy elemental powers. Dahl could have a... well screw Dahl... Nobody likes Dahl. Someone else can come up with that one.

Meanwhile... Two kindred spirits have found each other. Sal and Brick have struck up quite the friendship. They're best buds and heterosexual life partners. And having a similar mindset, they're not at all interested in this Siren bs. THERE'S TREASURE TO BE HAD! Countless Vaults to be looted. Sal, Brick and legions of newly recruited Slabs set out to pillage the universe. Their campaign is devoid of any morality. They are out to get rich and have fun doing it. With little regard for the lives they will be ruining along the way. While they are not setting out with the intent of hurting innocents, they aren't exactly considerate. They arrive on Vault planets like a swarm of locusts. With reckless abandon, they consume the resources of nearby settlements, and though they discourage their Slabs from harming the locals, Sal and Brick aren't the best at policing them. If they see a slab acting out of line in front of them, they have no reservations in killing him right there on the spot and apologizing to the victim. But the Slabs wise up and just do their bad stuff when Sal and Brick aren't around. 

Now we're at Axton, Mordicahi and Gaige. Their former friends and allys are ripping the galaxy apart. Sal and Brick are out of control, and the Siren's war with the corporations are causing catastrophic amounts of collateral damage. They're stuck in the middle, but untimely they need this to stop. This can't go on. Its out of control and innocents are dying. They are stuck in a difficult position. These are their friends, but that bond is slowly wearing thin and will soon dissolve. They are forced to make a hard choice. They need to end this in whatever way they can. They have to stop the Slabs, the Sirens, the Corporations. Their task is overwhelming. Resources are extremely limited. And their opponents are vast in number and power. The scariest of which is becoming the Sirens. They seem to be losing touch with reality. Their search for these missing Sirens is driving them into a focused frenzy and they seem to be losing their regard for human life. Placing the lives of a couple of Sirens before those of the rest of humanity. And their powers seem to have increased exponentially as the Slabs open more and more Vaults. 

Now... there is one wild card here. Zer0. He has no more interest in Vault Hunting. Been there, done that. He wants to go big. Really big for his next challenge. Because that's what its all about for Zer0. He didn't come to Pandora looking to get rich. He came to Pandora to top himself. Opening more Vaults doesn't intrigue him. He's decided the last great thing for him to overcome is reality itself. He wants to end the universe. And he's found the means to do so. He is the real threat. Lets hope someone realizes that. He's pulling more strings than anyone will know. Using the other characters and their missions as a Decepti0n on a grand scale to get his task complete.

Here's where the player comes in. You choose. You pick your side. And your path will cross with all the other opposing factions. There is a certain moral grey area in each group. And its all self perpetuating. While the Slabs seem like they are only doing bad, its their opening of the Vaults that is strengthening the Sirens, leveling the playing field in their fight against the vast armies of the corporations. And while the Sirens may seem to have lost their humanity, they are preventing another company from becoming the next Hyperion. And while Axton, Gaige and Mord seem to be doing the most good, they are actually assisting the corporations (the old enemy of my enemy idiom). You could even go so far as to say the only one with any real solution to end all of this pain, suffering and war is Zer0. 

Who's team are you on? 

I haven't put much thought to the best way the player should be injected into all of this. A new set of Vault Hunters? Can you even call them Vault Hunters anymore? Or do you get to play all of the old characters, but now your roster is 7 to choose from, rather than just four? But with tweeked, updated and upgraded new abilities. 

Which ever side you end up on, you've got to deal with the other factions. This means different bosses, different story arcs, different endings. And a butt load of replayability. And more than anything else, it will up the ante. Which seems to be the name of the game when it comes to BL. 

ANNNNNNNDDDD... I'm spent. Thanks for reading! Feels good to finally get that out. 

Edit: Wow. Holy crap. Posted this right before bed. Just woke up. Reading through everyone's comments. And you guys have made your case, and I'll agree, this most definitely won't work for BL3. Co op would be tough. How the player fits into this story is clearly the weakest part of this theory. You guys caught that and called me on it quickly. But thanks again everyone for reading and I'm really excited to hear what you have to say.

And everyone hates how hard it is to spawn Vermivorous... (Completely luck based and the drops suck, not even guaranteed any Legendaries unlike Terra)

So...

Sir Hammerlock contacts you with a breakthrough. He says he needs to you come to him with X amount of Eridium (Lets say... 70 to make it hard to obtain).

When you get there he explains how he's been researching the data from the Mutated Varkid side-quest you do ~20, and he's found an extremely powerful and dangerous species of Varkid.

Of course he wants you to kill it, using his new serum. It's made with Eridium, which forces evolution and makes Varkids rapidly evolve.

Inject it into a pod and the pod will grow bigger and bigger until Vermi spawns. After the quest he offers to make you more for the same cost.

Quest could be called something like:

**You. Will. Die. (No, seriously now, you will)**

And will only be able to be obtained after killing Terramorphous.

This keeps it in line with the other boss quests like Tannis giving you the Terra quest, or the Crawmerax quest in BL1.

1352061076.0,312,self.Borderlands,12mlml,Why the Evil Smasher is my favorite gun (and why it should be yours),lewkiss,373,61,166,http://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/12mlml/why_the_evil_smasher_is_my_favorite_gun_and_why/,"The Evil Smasher is a unique gun you get for completing Marcus' *The Chosen One* quest. At first glance, with its 6-8 size magazine, mediocre accuracy, and less than desirable damage stat, it looks like vendor garbage. However, this gun has a crazy powerful effect that most people don't bother to look into.

Let me first say that the red text description on [this](http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Special_Weapon_Effects_Bordelands_2#Combat_Rifles) page is very inaccurate. This gun's effect is very unique: on reload, it has a small chance to increase its stats by crazy amounts. This effect is triggered when a visible explosion occurs in front of you. It's also apparent by seeing your magazine size increase in the bottom left. Reloading again will either drop you down one tier in terms of stat increases, or trigger the effect again. 

First off, every time this effect occurs, it can increase your stats by different amounts. This is most apparent by looking at how much your magazine size increased. Since I can't provide you with accuracy and fire rate stats without corresponding pictures/videos, I'm going to provide you with the magazine size and damage increases. I'm going to use my current Evil Smasher to give you some stats:

My (level 25) Evil Smasher's mag size is 8 and its damage is 238. Remember, this is a Torgue weapon, so explosive damage isn't even calculated yet. 

Using Marcus' firing range dummy, a shot to the body deals 821 damage and a critical hit deals 1114. Not too bad, but let's see where we can get these stats.

The lowest my magazine can be after triggering this effect is 31. Now, a shot to the body deals **5687** damage and a critical hit deals **7716**. **Wow.** And this is the *lowest* my stats can be after this effect triggers. And don't forget, this is also improving your accuracy, accuracy recovery, fire rate, and recoil reduction in incredible amounts.

The next mag size is 54. A shot to the body deals **10553** and a critical hit deals **14319**. At this point the crosshairs recover from firing almost instantly.

Next we have a 77 bullet magazine. A body shot deals **15419** and a critical hit deals **20921**. 

Next is a 100 bullet magazine (this isn't even the highest!). A body shot now deals **20286** and a critical deals **27523**. Crosshairs are almost touching and fire rate is impeccable. Step aside Bee. 

Now we are greeted with a 123 bullet mag. A body shot now deals **25152** damage and a critical hit deals **34126**. This is with a gun with 238 base damage!

Finally, we have our 146 bullet magazine size (on a Torgue gun remember!). This took me pretty long to get to, so it's not common, but here are the numbers. A body shot deals **30018** and a critical hit deals **40728**. **Smokin' Jesus titty cinnamon.**

You must be thinking ""where has this gun been all my life"". Well, let me tell you the best part of this weapon. **This effect will effect every gun you have equipped.** Yup, you read right. A glitch(?) causes this effect to work with all of your guns. All you need to do is equip your Evil Smasher and use its effect once. Swapping weapons will give you the same effects on all of them (however, swapping back to the Evil Smasher will drop you down a tier of stat increases). You can be getting even greater numbers than this **at level 25** **with all of your guns**. In fact, after you use the effect once, you don't even need the Evil Smasher equipped to use this effect. GG Evil Smasher. This effect can have so many applications, whether it be combined with The Bee for massive damage or increasing your Baby Maker's magazine size to 100+.

So, there's my barebones description of my newly found favorite weapon. I can only imagine the carnage a level 50 Evil Smasher could cause. If anyone with one would like to throw up some numbers, I'll add them to the OP.

1374547027.0,304,self.Borderlands,1iuwuv,New character idea: PAL-D1N prototype defensive robot.,willyolio,386,82,78,http://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1iuwuv/new_character_idea_pald1n_prototype_defensive/,"Backstory: A prototype robot created by the Anshin corporation.  Anshin realized that defensive equipment are not as lucrative as offensive equipment; however, they own no patents for various gun technology.  So, they decided to find out ways to repurpose shield technology for offensive uses.  A ""hostile takeover"" by hyperion (like what happened to TK Baha) led the lead scientist to enter a basic mission protocol into its AI: Kill Hyperion.  The scientist then threw the robot into the nearest outgoing cargo barge, which happened to be destined for Pandora.

Basic role: I've found that there are no characters that truly have any shield specialties.  Sure, most have some kind of basic shield skills, but nothing that truly makes or breaks a build.  Other aspects of the game are well-covered.  Salvador + Axton = everything with guns and tankiness, Zer0 = melee/sniping/stealth, krieg = melee/explosives/grenades, Maya = elemental/disabling/healing, Gaige = wildcard/pure damage.  That's a pretty wide variety there, but nothing that really involves shields... so here's PAL-D1N.

Full name: Prototype Anshin Learning bot - Defensive/mk. 1/Revision N
- 

Other characteristics:

- Slightly taller than Salvador
- ""heavy"" (i.e. high inertia like Krieg)
- YELLOW health bar (armoured).  Still affected normally by healing skills and such.  Less health than average.

Action Skill: Overshield
-
- works like the ION Loader's shield: when deployed, it puts up a shield over a small area with continuous recharge (no delay) that can deflect projectiles coming from outside the shield.  It shares capacity with your equipped shield, but has 0 recharge delay (continuous regen) and an inherently fast recharge rate (determined by character level).  Lasts 20 seconds.  When the skill ends, your equipped shield will recharge to 100%.

Skill tree 1 focuses on boosting the Overshield's capabilities.  Sample skills:

- Increase the Overshield's regeneration rate but decreases capacity (e.g. 10%/-2% per level)
- increase the Overshield's radius (20% per level)
- Deploying the overshield now knocks back and stuns enemies (1 point)
- Adds continuous electric and fire damage inside the shield (rank 1-5)
- PAL-D1N now continuously ejects explosive/corrosive balls that bounce around inside the overshield while it's active (rank 1-5)
- enemy projectiles hitting the shield (from inside or outside) are redirected towards enemies.  (+20% chance/+60% damage per level)
- Friendly projectiles passing through the shield gain slag damage
- damaging enemies with shields recharges the overshield even faster
- Allies inside the overshield get (+20%/level) of the overshield's recharge rate
- kills made inside the overshield extend overshield's duration
- **capstone skill**: +200% recharge rate.  No maximum capacity (skills/mods/relics that affect capacity only determine capacity at activation).  All of the overshield's offensive capabilities have their damage boosted equal to the overshield's current capacity (e.g. 140% capacity = +140% damage)

Skill Tree 2 focuses on boosting your equipped shield's capabilities + Capacitor stacking.

- **Capacitor Stacking**: when your shield reaches maximum capacity, it gains 1 Cap Stack.  Your shield continues to ""recharge"" in the background until it reaches another 100% worth of charge, and adds another stack.  Increases recharge rate by 2%/level, max stacks +10/level.  Each stack boosts damage resistance by 1% and health regeneration by 0.1%.  You lose stacks if your shield has **not** been at maximum capacity for several seconds.  The Overshield gains benefits from cap stacks.  The action skill will very easily boost you up a few dozen stacks, by the way.

- increase special effect damage (nova, spike, roid, and amp shields, +1%/level/cap stack)
- shield steal- damaging enemies recharges your shields as a % of damage dealt.  Will add to capacitor stacking if you're already at full shields.  Dealing damage to enemy shields doubles the bonus.
- increase special effect percentages (adaptive, booster, absorb shields, +2%/level/cap stack.  note: this multiplies, not adds.  Absorb shields over 100% may give you multiple bullets)
- Allows shields to **overcharge** by +5%/level, and increases recharge rate by +5%/level.  For Nova/Amp shields and Capacitor Stacking, the shield is considered ""fully charged"" at 100% base capacity instead of overcharged capacity.
- Allows Absorb/Adaptive/Spike/Booster shields to continue operating when depleted, at a cost of 1 cap stack per (+1/level) hits.
- Increase delay before cap stacks disappear
- Allies inside the overshield gain Cap Stack bonuses
- Cap stacks add to cooldown recharge speed (+0.2%/level/stack)
- cap stacks increase the Overshield's recharge rate (+1%/level/stack)
- **Capstone skill**: allows you to take up one weapon slot and equip a second shield.  Capacity and recharge rates are added.  Special effects operate independently (e.g. 2 spike shields will both produce their own spike damages).  Recharge delay is averaged.

Skill tree 3 is more directly offensive capabilities.  Probably something with a robot theme.  I haven't really thought about it much yet.  One idea is that it's a ""learning"" robot- Anshin intended for it to go out, use other company's weapons, and steal data.

How we found this out is the following way

We noticed after B.A.R. that for a brief second you see 1/29 on the lower right hand corner, indicating that his axe has ""ammo""

We equipped him with a modded relic for pistol fire rate +300%, along with our pistols shooting obscenely fast we managed to throw about 30+ axes in buzz axe rampage, BAR worked basically like a Jacobs pistol. 

We then equipped him with a pistol damage relic and nothing happened, but obviously a melee damage relic helped 

SO we came to the following conclusion 

Kriegs axe is a ""fist-pistol"" so any relic that increases pistol fire rate or melee damage positively effects it ",,False,self,t5_2r8cd,False,,krieg1,True,t3_1fiqty,http://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1fiqty/a_glitch_about_krieg_me_and_my_friend_found/,

Its a shotgun with okay stats.  But instead of just throwing it on the ground to explode when it is reloaded, it flies through the air and chases targets, shooting the whole way, until it hits them and explodes.  I had to make a video to show it off:

But i just wanted to take a moment to send out a personal thanks to Gearbox.

Today, i reached level 50 on my character for the first time. Some people may think I'm a slowpoke, and that's fine. Yet, the way I see it, I'm happy I'm just now reaching 50. I've spent alot of time simply exploring the world of Pandora. All the creatures to see and places to go. My favorite feeling is going some place new, and not knowing if madness or mayhem lie around the corner. That's what this game means to me. 

Gearbox,
You guys have given me one of the best thrill rides I've had in a game, or, hell, even in life in general. So you guys should know how much you mean to me and all of the fine gamers on this subreddit and across the world. I say this because, in all of the controversy with the level cap and second season that's arriving with your announcement, I wanted to send a message from the most valuable people you know: your community. I know you may never see this. This could get downvoted to shit. But i don't care. Because the community i see on this subreddit are dedicated to making a masterpiece of gaming art even greater. I've spent 300 some hours on just borderlands 2 alone. I have the ultimate loot chest and the limited edition guide. i have posters and artwork all over the place. And it's all because you guys had an idea. An idea of a planet filled with Bandits and mystery and loot. So i can honestly say with confidence that i am now and forever a vault hunter. I can't thank you enough for enticing and exciting me like you have these past years, and i ask, if you even see this, that you keep your heads up. look on to the future of pandora. Your community will support you no matter what you do. Because it's not just about the loot or the prizes anymore. It's about the experience. You guys are damn good at what you do. keep it up.

Borderlands community,
Guys, nows the time. when i read about the upcoming level cap increase or new season of dlc, half of what i read online is hatred and profanity towards Gearbox. Not that we dont all love profanity ;) but it's not right. Those of us who live and love this game, we gotta support gearbox. when i see their logo, i know that what i'm getting is from a group of high quality, genuinely good people. so please. as one of the largest organized borderlands communities on the internet, /r/Borderlands and /r/Borderlands2, stay true to the game. like i said before. i might be speaking out of turn, or i might sound stupid. but this game means alot to me. and someday, i want to dust off my computer and show my kids what games i played when i was young. I know that the haters aren't really gonna bother gearbox. to gearbox, they probably don't mean a thing. but they don't deserve some of the things i've read. so, in light of this, i'm asking you guys to keep playing and buying borderlands 1 &amp; 2. 
Thanks if you took the time to read this. you're probably one of the few who cares what an 18 year old kid has to say. but it means a lot.

Keep looting,

Among the level cap increase and various other changes coming to Borderlands 2 on April 2, 2013 is a new playthrough -- Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode -- built for challenging high-level play.

Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode differs quite a bit from Normal Mode and True Vault Hunter Mode -- here's a quick rundown of the major changes:

Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode Details

Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode is unlocked for a character once they have completed the main story missions in True Vault Hunter Mode and reached level 50.

Unlike other playthroughs, Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode can be replayed multiple times with players able to reset their overall mission progress at any time from the Main Menu.

No more tutorial missions -- characters in Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode begin in Southern Shelf with the ""Cleaning Up the Berg"" mission.

While playing in Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode, enemies and bosses will scale according to the player's current level or, if playing with others, the highest-level player in that party.

Gameplay changes in UVHM:
Enemy health generally increased 4x.
Enemies now have a moderate amount of health regeneration.
Increased duration of slag damage multiplier effect.
Upped the damage that slagged enemies take from 2x to 3x.
Weapon swap speed increased to better facilitate slag use.
Enemies now more likely to drop ammo.
Loot Midgets are now ""Legendary Loot Midgets"" that can drop Legendary and other top-tier gear.

Check back Monday for details on the various bug fixes in Tuesday's update, and don't forget there's more to come for Borderlands 2: Krieg the Psycho, a new playable character, arrives in May with the fourth campaign add-on (included in the Season Pass) hitting by the end of June!

1349400681.0,288,self.Borderlands,10yxbj,"If I could make a DLC expansion, this would be it. (spoilers)",Team_Braniel,399,111,193,http://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/10yxbj/if_i_could_make_a_dlc_expansion_this_would_be_it/,"Fair warning, I'm not censoring my spoilers, so if you haven't beaten it once yet, might want to look away now.

I'd call it Fallen Angels. 

Upon the death of Roland and returning to Sanctuary there would be an additional ECHO recorder and a quest from Brick/Mordecai.  The ECHO would be left from Angel and say something along the lines of ""if you are hearing this then it means I am free..."" it goes on to outline how Jack's Moonbase's main uplink from Pandora is the converted old Crimson Fastness, go there to stop Hyperion's ability to use the moonbase on Pandora (stop the air raids, loader launches, etc)

You get there, you whoop some ass, you shut down three satellite arrays...  Victory?  You use the ECHONet to fast travel back to Sanctuary (or anywhere) and something goes wrong.  The jump fails, you are scrambled and lost, you come to in a black room with almost no lights and a single button.

You push it, the walls open up, you are in space, specifically on the Moonbase in an observation room overlooking Pandora.  You get to see Pandora for about 15 seconds as the blast doors slowly open.  THEN THEY SLAM SHUT AGAIN.

A wicked AI voice, similar to Angel only sadistic, comes on.  Identifies herself as ""Dark Angel"" and makes a joke about ""testing"" before dropping the floor out from under you and leaving you in a tash compactor (throwback to Star Wars) you then have a timed battle with JNK Loaders and a named Thresher.  (create your own Star Wars challenge titles)

You get out and continue to explore the moonbase.

You learn through voice over that Dark Angle is an AI, created by Jack as an imprint of his daughter, to come online if she were to die.  It is explained that Angel was integrated into the Hyperion network which is why she was able to contact you like she did in the games.  Dark Angel was a digitized backup of Angel's personality then ""improved"" by Jack.  (made into a bitch).

The moonbase is designed opposite of Pandora.  No trash.  Everything is sleek and clean.  Lots of plastic and glass.  No curved angles, everything is angular and backlit.  Think of the Hyperion Shotguns.  Elitist.  Sleek.  Like a distopian Deathstar if it was made by Apple.

All the Loaders are there.  Also there is a biological race of somewhat amorphous beings.  They are self powering and can meld with mechenery.  So if you disable or destroy a loader, they can pick it up, stick it into their body, and then use it to kick your ass, with the abilities of the loader, they can do this multiple times.  Think how the Goliaths power up, only gaining the traits of the Loaders they kill.

One of the zones is a shrine, a mosoleum, to Angel.  The whole floor of the main area is glass looking out into Pandora.  In the center is a dais with all manner of cables and wires running into it with the body of (the real) Angel lying in a backlit coffin.

One of the amorphous creatures (call them ""Noans"" from ""Noare"") is friendly, gives you a mission to ""help her"".  You fight through a central core of the base to find an AI center.  Inside it you fight the Android body of Dark Angel, and eventually procure an ""uncorrupted"" digitized backup of Angel's personality.

You return it to the Noan and with his help you resurrect Angel as a Cyborg.  At this point you have unlocked Angel as a new Playable Character for the game.  ""Fallen Angel"".  Her body is half cybernetic, she has blue plasma wings that resemble the Phoenix wings the sirens have.  Her abilities are no longer Siren based, but Mechanical based.  Her main ability lets her fly up into the air (10-20 feet, depending on space) and rail plasma on the field.  Some upgrades include the ability to take on abilities from defeated Loaders (similar to the Noans), chain the plasma so that when it hits an enemy it jumps from one to the next doing damage, and electrical elemental damage with perks such as ""stun"" which cause electrocuted enemies to be shocked and not able to move or attack while under the effect.

This pissed Dark Angel off to the extreme and she goes on full assault.  You are forced to retreat back into the moonbase and areas you passed through originally are now active, and moving, changing shape.  The Moonbase isn't just a fortress, it is a ship, a battleship, and you are inside it.  With Angel's help you fight your way to the reactor core of the moonbase, and in the climax of the DLC you Fight off an enhanced Dark Angel while the other Angel ""plugs in"" to the core to overload it with her own power.  

The place explodes with everyone on it and starts crashing down.  You get a short playable sequence where you have to run and jump from debris to debris as it is in the air falling to the ground.  You have to get to Angel and reach her before impact.  At which point Angel creates a stasis field that saves you two (and the Noan) from death.

That is the end of the DLC, from that point on the moon base is gone from the sky, the Noan is present in Sanctuary, and Fallen Angel is a playable character.


Also you could let the Noan mod your weapons for you, adding a crafting element to the game.  That would be cool too.

Obviously I haven't thought it all the way out, this is just random day dreaming while at work.

For most of the weapons it's about 2%, 2.5% or 4%. This also includes the elemental damage of the weapon. 

With Rubi, you get 12% of your damage converted to health. This is calculated after class mods, relics, badass ranks, and any other multiplier. So if you see a 160K after a shot, you get 20,160 health regenerated. 

But here's the best part. This includes the elemental damage, you get 12% returned. There's a lot of different combinations this is helpful with. If you're a cataclysm siren, you can just set a bunch of fleshies on fire and you'll constantly regenerate health off those DoT ticks. Shock Mechromancer and a shock rubi works well together too.

The best combination, however, and my personal favorite is the gunzerker and a slag rubi. Any damage done to an enemy slagged by this gun ALSO gets converted to health, sense it technically counts as elemental damage. So if i'm dual wielding a rubi and unkempt harold, i can do some serious damage and get some serious health regeneration.

I'm on xbox if you're looking for any gear or questions. GT: greatjamama1. Once I find out how to video tape my game, I'm going to post a video of a great build revolved around this. Until then, happy looting vault hunters.

EDIT: Thank you all for your feedback. There's a lot of questions here, and I have not had the opportunity to test everything yet, but I'm going to try to get back to all of your questions by tomorrow night.

In Headstone Mine, you fight Sledge, the rather dumb and burly bandit leader for the Arid Badlands. After listening to him talk, I realized that I have been hearing his type of vocalizations often recently. Goliaths talk very similarly to Slegde himself. Further, he has obscene melee prowess, able to slam the ground and knock you back, which requires strength no normal human could obtain. I believe that Sledge could have been, or was one of, the first goliaths Pandora has seen.

One could just chalk it up to the 'dumb muscle' archetype, and, yes, that's probably what the developers were going for with Sledge. However, they have set up (at least, from what I am reading in the wiki) that after 'something' was found at the headstone mine, people were starting to become heavily mutated. Which, makes sense: the whole point of the Headstone mine was to dig out, hopefully, alien relics for use by Dahl. If they did find something there, and people started to mutate, well, it was probably alien.

Then, shortly after the first Vault's opening, Eridium, which is described as a 'precious alien element' started popping up in every which place all over Pandora. And, at most five years after the opening, our heroes have started to fight much, MUCH more mutated humans that can rip out their own skulls through their jaw, and have absurd melee prowess. 

(and, to grasp at straws, Sledge's Shotgun is a rare drop of what is probably the biggest non-raging Goliath around, Crash-Head.

Seeing as the Psycho class just got announced, I should probably share this now before it becomes obsolete. ",BananaWaffles12,337,75,75,http://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1b3i7q/for_the_past_few_months_i_have_been_developing_my/,"About a month after Borderlands 2 came out, I decided I would start developing my own character class. I want to one day work in the video game industry, and Borderlands is one of the games that I would love to work on most. In the past I have developed character classes (a Demon Hunter for World of Warcraft, for example), deciding it was good practice for when I want to get into the field, or if nothing else, it would look good for when I send in a resume. 

I was torn between two class types; an android/robot like character, which I didn't peruse so I don't remember much about her. The second was an ex-bandit gone vault hunter. I developed the character for months, mostly for fun, but hoping that one day I could submit it to Gearbox and, even if it didn't become an actual character, could use it to prove that I could be a credit to their team. 

When the Borderlands team announced a month or so ago that they were going to announce a new character, I said jokingly to my boyfriend ""Just watch, it's going to be a Psycho, and all of my work will be for nothing."" He told me I should finish it quickly and post it online before the new character was announced, just in case it WAS a psycho, and then I wouldn't be accused of just stealing their character idea and lacking creativity. 

I stalled, the character was announced, and I was crushed. 

I know that if I'd finished my character before the announcement it wouldn't have changed anything; they've probably been working on this character since the game came out. But still, it meant that my idea had validity, I could have worked on it with the Borderlands team, but because of my inexperience I didn't get that chance. 

The character has been common knowledge for a few days(?) now, and at risk of seeming like a copy cat, I'd like to at least share my idea and get your guys' opinions. It's a very loose concept (as I said, I stalled getting my ideas on paper, and most of them were lost in the chaos I call my brain), and is VERY different from Krieg, but hopefully you all will still like it all the same. 



**TL;DR HAVE SOME DOODLES** http://imgur.com/a/e5WSP




I would very much appreciate any comments or critiques you might have, or advice on how to develop her further :) I know my art isn't fantastic, and is very unprofessional, but it's something I've been improving on over the past few months, and hopefully someday I'll get to the point where I can be a concept artist for Borderlands, or any other number of video game companies. 

If anyone cares, here is my deviatart account where I posted Sierra for the first time, dated December 18th http://sahjin12.deviantart.com/art/Sierra-343601436

EDIT: oh, it's also worth noting that I haven't looked at Krieg's skill tree yet (I heard it was released, though I'm not sure how much detail). So none of this is at all inspired by Krieg's design, not even the skills. Which, given the lack of skills I have listed, would have done nothing but help me, but I wanted to list only the ideas that I had come up with myself.

**If you do choose to downvote, please leave feedback of why so I can try to improve this. Thank you.**

**[20121020] I feel like I should explain a little better that this is a concept. It has been pointed out that this looks like a menu you may see in a flash game. That's because I used Inkscape to make it, which draws in SVG format. The actual color scheme I chose was something that would match close to the original colors from the game, but I did not feel like investing the time to replicate the exact texture of the menu. Since this is a concept, it is also pretty... Flat. If this were to be implemented into the game, it would receive the same treatment as the current menu; all of the holographic effects, textures, and 3D effects would be there. So, just keep in mind that some concepts do look bad but improve to be something great. Borderlands itself was a concept once...**

You're a busy guy, I get that. Everyone has places to be, and I don't want to be inconsiderate but I need to ask you a favor.

Please stop throwing your loot everywhere. You're not saving very much time by chucking everything everywhere, and while it looked very dramatic the first time, you are making my life very difficult. I'm sure a neat pile would be just as quick for you, Warrior, and I could see what you dropped and get moving to respawn you faster.

Also, you keep falling on top of your damn loot, its getting ridiculous. Not only does it take me forever to look around for loot, which you might have tossed in lava, but you're probably covering up one awesome piece of loot per kill. I'm trying to find a shotgun, you oversized skag, not play ""needle in a haystack"".

Not sure if this has been addressed before, but i find the run from Hero's Pass to the Vault of the warrior kind of long and annoying and overall a huge waste of time.
(If you aren't perma camped there), so here's a quick tip.

1. Load your ""normal mode"" playthrough.
2. Run through Hero's Pass without taking any damage.
3. Get into vault
4. Save/Quit
5. Switch to TVHM
6. Find yourself in the vault in TVHM
7. Re-farm


Might have been mentioned before, but some people might find it useful!

1367959223.0,244,self.Borderlands,1dvvqk,I don't like UVHM at all. Here's why.,MausIguana,378,134,225,http://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1dvvqk/i_dont_like_uvhm_at_all_heres_why/,"Hear me out. To start off, I was a huge fan of the first Borderlands, and think that Gearbox improved on it in many ways in the sequel. I have several high level characters and am in the middle of leveling my second to 61. That's what inspired me to post this.  
  
UVHM is dull. Gameplay-wise, it's still Borderlands - more or less. The enemies take more bullets to kill, and can put you down faster. This is how difficulty scales in all games, that's not something new. However, in BL2, the difficulty jump is so extensive that you're basically shoehorned into using slag. This is clunky, inconvenient, and restricts your weapon choice and playstyle so much. In a game which uses randomly generated loot like Borderlands, you shouldn't be struggling to take enemies down with max level gear. However, that's clearly where Gearbox was going with this.  
  
Before you get out your torches and pitchforks in protest, bonus damage from and duration of slag was specifically increased for UVHM. Slag worked well before - completely optional, it was hard to master but made you very powerful if you did. It allowed players to diversify their playstyles, and rewarded those who did. In UVHM, it works in reverse: players who try different playstyles suffer more, and those who don't use slag are punished. The weakest enemies survive a Norfleet shot to the face. There's a challenge, and then there's this, which feels like much more artificial difficulty.  
  
It feels like Gearbox is trying to push players to online multiplayer, or at least online in general (Shift codes, raid boss lockouts, slag dependence). Personally, I don't play online, but that's not what this thread is about. I'm more concerned about what cumbersome gameplay mechanics will be thrown at us next under the guise of difficulty.

One complaint that I've heard a lot on here is that the DLCs feel like they're too short, people power through them in a weekend or less. They also compare them to the BL1 DLC's, which usually took much longer.

I think content-wise, the DLC's are about the same, but there is one thing that BL1 DLCs lacked that BL2 DLCs have: A fast travel network.

Back in Dr. Ned and Knoxx's Armory (only 2 I played), there was only 1 fast travel station in each DLC region. For Knoxx in particular, if you wanted to get somewhere, you had to spend a pretty good amount of time to get there. If you were headed out to Lockdown Palace you:

Spawned in T-Bone Junction.

Got in a car.

Traveled to the Map exit

Drove down the Crimson Tollway

Stopped at a blocked area, fought your way along the underside of the highway

Came back up to the top of the highway

Fought through a tough Mech in the tunnel

Got back in a car

Drove to the map exit

...The list goes on. It used to take me a good 20 minutes of fighting and travelling for me to get from T-Bone Junction to Lockdown Palace.

But now each area in the DLC has its own fast travel station, can you imagine how difficult it would be if you had to walk/drive all the way from the Rustyards to Washburn, and then walk/drive all the way back? Or if the first FT station in Hammerlock was the only one, and you had to run/boat/fight all the way to claptrap, *every time?* Hell, I get bored when I spawn at the Oasis FT machine and have to run to the Treasure room. When you start Torgue, its about 5 Minutes of walk/drive/fight until you get to the dome.

I don't know about you guys but it feels like the awesome rewarding feeling of finding guns from BL1 did not carry over into BL2 and this is my theory why.

First of all, in BL1 gun chests were rewards for finishing a section of the map. in BL2 they are a reward for finishing a section of the map and then spending an extra 5 to 10 min looking around for where the developer decided to hide them. Lets take one of the first side missions from BL1 for example. The bladeflower seed farming quest from TK. You have to go down this long passage way collecting little seeds from plants as you fight off hoards of skags. Then once you have collected them all you reach the end of the corridor and there is a chest waiting for you! *reward* Plus you can drop down and you are way closed to where you started no backtracking needed. I don't know why the developers decided to remove this map style from the game in BL2. It gave the gamer a visible goal of where they had to reach and it also gave them the motivation of knowing there was going to be a chest waiting for you. I don't know how many times while playing BL2 I would say ""there has to be a chest around here...I just killed all these guys and came all this way..."" but there wasn't one *no reward*

Second off, and more important in my opinion I think the immense differences between weapon manufacturers was a flawed decision. And you are probably thinking to yourself, ""No! stupid guy! they are awesome! makes all the guns so different!""...but hear me out on this. 

In BL1 everyone had their favorite type(s) of weapon (pistol, shotty, snipes...), the game even assisted at this by having a lot of weapon specific skills (which is a discussion for another day). In my experience people liked 2 or 3 different types of weapons and always gravitated toward those. So... this means that every time a chest was opened (which was a lot more in BL1) there was a 2/7 or 3/7 chance that it was going to be a gun worth looking at and comparing. In my opinon that was one of the most rewarding things, finding a new gun to replace your old one, and trying it out. Now you are probably asking ""what has changed??""

Weapon manufacturers my friends. Just like I mentioned before, everyone has a fav 2 or 3 gun types and that is the same in BL2 but now everyone has a fav manufacturer for their fav gun type. (jakobs pistols, maliwan smgs, torgue ARs). So basically there is now a 2/7 or 3/7 chance that the chest you open in BL2 will have the gun type you want and then another 1/3 or 1/4 chance that it will be in the manufacturer that you want. And if its not... you don't even bother looking at its stats. 

This is a huge flaw because i found that as I leveled up my characters in BL2 it was rare to find minute stat increases for my favorite guns instead I would be using the same level 19 gun until level 23 when I happened to find another one similar to replace it. This also meant that it would be more and more difficult killing enemies until you found the level 23 gun. 

I really wanted to enjoy BL2 more than BL1 and every time I play BL2 I keep telling myself, ""Lets try to find why this is more fun than BL1"" but I always turn off the xbox a little later and sit there puzzled why it felt like a chore without any rewards. So I decided to write this.

Here are the pearls I have found so far:

**Unforgiven:**

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=136292953

Pistol

Jakobs

76988 Damage

98.6 Accuracy

2.4 Fire Rate

2.1 Reload Speed

8 Round Clip

""It's a helluva thing...""

It seems to not stop at walls, but instead bounce around until it hits an enemy. That might be the case, I don't really know because it is hard to tell exactly what is going on.  Either way, it does a HUGE amount of damage, even compared to other level 61 Pearl weapons. **EDIT:**  a nice man just told me that the Trick Shot prefix is what is causing the bouncing bullets. I wasn't aware and I apologize for my error.  I will say that this thing does more per shot than most snipers, so it is still devastating. **EDIT 2:** I did not realize it, but this thing does insane crit damage. I found another one that is not a Trick Shot, and it has a 89K base damage. it does 600K critical hit damage, so I am guessing around 500% crit damage is another stat for this gun.

**Storm:**

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=136292879

Sniper Rifle (Only a level 60, not a 61, so a 61's stats would be, presumably, much higher)

Maliwan

64293 Damage

96.8 Accuracy

1.1 Fire Rate

4.0 Reload Speed

6 Round Clip

12240.6 Electric Damage

56.3% Chance to Shock

""Tut, Tut, it looks like rain""

When the shot hits something, a huge, Norfleet-like explosion happens. it then gives way to lots of flashing sparks, like the Flakker. Judging by the name, I am guessing it only comes in shock (and since the other legendary Maliwan sniper is only fire).

**Avenger:**

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=136292936

SMG

Tediore

20322 Damage

93.3 Accuracy

9.3 Fire Rate

1.5 Reload Speed

49 Round Clip

15% Chance to Slag

""Counterbution revengence. The reckoning""

When thrown (reloaded) it bounces around on the ground, firing full auto randomly in circles. Doesn't seem to be able to hit the player, but it might. after a short while, it explodes like normal.  absolutely devastating with slag in a crowd. just throw one in, and then bask in that sweet, sweet x3 damage. **EDIT:** apparently, according to some on the gearbox forums, this gun regenerates ammo. I don't know what that means or if it is true, but that's what they're saying

**Butcher:**

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=136292903

Shotgun (this is the first one I found, so it is only level 52 and is totally underpowered compared to the others. however, I am including it because it totally rocks the fucking house.)

Hyperion

5837x3 Damage

77.1 Accuracy

7.0 Fire Rate

2.9 Reload Speed

12 Round Clip

4604.4 Corrosive Damage

8% Chance to Corrode

""Fresh Meat!""

This is the best shotgun in the game. the fire rate is insane for a shotgun. the accuracy gets high a lot faster than the hearbreaker or CC, and stays higher longer. it definitely shoots more than 3 pellets per shot, and does a fuckload of damage. I definitely want this thing at 61 ASAP!

Regarding where these dropped, they were all from random bandits and lockers (and one from a Dahl chest). and since I have it set that if a weapon is going to drop, it's going to be legendary, I can guess that these guns have the lowest drop rate imaginable.  I saw probably 30 legendaries at least between each pearl. If you are gonna farm these (I have no idea who or what is most likely to drop them), be prepared to get frustrated.

a few notes about UVHM: you current legendaries are going to go out of style fast. this is hard city, even with a modded character trying to run through it as fast as possible.  leveling up didn't take as along as I expected, though I only went through 2 levels legitimately.  and the game scales everything to your level. if you level up in an area, the chests will still be leveled to the one you were at when you entered the area.  This is exactly the kind of content that I think a lot of people stuck at End Game were looking for.

If any of you guys find any other ones, be sure to post them. I can't wait to get all these mother fuckers and become the ultimate badass.

**AUTHOR'S NOTE** for anyone who hates modding the game, don't worry, this guy never sees the light of day. he has never been online, and he never will be unless I am playing with friends. I have a legit character that I will be playing UVHM with, so don't bitch about the fact that I am cheating.

**EDITING WITH NEW GUNS!!!!**

as I find new ones, I'll add their info here.

**Stalker:**

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=136313807

Pistol

Vladof

36435 Damage

77.3 Accuracy

10.5 Fire Rate

2.4 Reload Speed

41 Round Clip

18% Chance to Slag

""You can run, but you can't hide""

It's like a little baby shreddifier. has an insane fire rate for a pistol. it shoots slower moving projectiles that bounce off of a surface or two before stopping.  in crowds, it's total madness. This one was found in a chest, and even though my drop rates are through the roof, it means that there is still a small chance to find one in a locker/dumpster/ammo chest/anything that can spawn legendaries, so leave no trash can un-rifled through.

**Bearcat:**

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=136338314

Assault Rifle

Dahl

37577x3 Damage

90.6 Accuracy

3.7 Fire Rate

39 Round Clip

13831.7 Corrosive Damage

6% Chance to Corrode

""I love the smell of popcorn in the morning""

this thing shoots 3 grenades in a spread. they bounce twice and then explode. the explosions of grenades will throw other ones around, so it gets a little chaotic.  it costs 6 ammo per shot.

**Tunguska:**

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=136373799

Rocket Launcher

Bandit

890761 Damage

79.2 Accuracy

0.9 Fire Rate

""It will split the sky in two""

the rocket has a slight arch to it, and it bounces up to head height when it hits the ground (it bounces the same amount off of walls if it hits a wall instead of the ground) and explodes.

Let me start off by stating that this is only my opinion. I am entitled to an opinion as much as you are entitled to yours. I have not formed this opinion based on childish impulses, and it might be different than how you think of what I described, and that is fine. But you won't change my mind by posting a paragraph telling me an alternate way to think of this situation that happens to be in your line of thinking.

  I started off in /r/Borderlands2, and I thought it was cool to have a sub dedicated to a game I was currently playing. Over the course of time, I became disillusioned with the sub based on that subs overall response to certain attitudes, and a high majority of that subs content just didn't amount to much. There were times when I would get heavily downvoted for saying something on topic, trying to offer advice, simply because it wasn't funny, wasn't immature, or they were jealous that I knew of something or had something they didn't. So I decided to unsub.

I found this sub by chance the following day, and noticed a markedly different atmosphere. *YES* there are similar posts because the subs are mostly about the same thing. I understand that. I just feel that the overall quality of this sub *in my own opinion* is better for me to get the information that I am looking for. I felt like giving a shout out of positive acknowledgement to most of the people who contribute to something I enjoy, and I compared it to something I dislike that could possibly be exactly the same but isn't. This is all.

Image macro's are fine if they aren't constant screenshots of red text on a weapon, or something everyone sees in the game and knows about.

1352177177.0,224,self.Borderlands,12po4w,A new Class idea- Dex: The Nano Engineer,Fearless_Idiot,329,105,77,http://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/12po4w/a_new_class_idea_dex_the_nano_engineer/,"I was wondering what the next class might be, and I realized that all the classes are really just futuristic versions of generic fantasy classes.

Axton the fighter, Maya the cleric, Salvador the barbarian, Zero the rogue and Gaige the necromancer. 

So I figured, what is this party missing? ...a Bard...

Now, Dex is a more support class than any of the others. he control the battle field with a range of buffs and debuffs that he can deliver using his action skill, Nano Burst 

Action skill- Nano Burst

Dex fires a cloud of nano bots in front of him in a wide area, Enemies take damage over time if they are in the cloud and for a few seconds after (this is non-elemental damage)

Each of the three trees has several skills that effect how Nano-burst works, but each in a different way.

Skill tree- ""Look Left and Cough""-
This is the Enemy debuff tree, the skills here have a more direct impact, altering the Nano-burst to effect your enemies in various and entertaining ways

- Adds corrosive damage to Nano-Burst
- The Nano bots will jam enemy guns occastionally if they are effected.
- Enemies who come into close proximity to an enemy effected by nano burst has a chance to have the swarm spread to him
- Each enemy killed will increase the size and the duration of the Nano swarm up to a size cap
- The Nano bot clouds explodes once it begins to dissipate. the bigger the cloud, the bigger the boom
- Nano bots take control over enemies they kill turning them into temporary allies and even more entertaining, suicide bombers

The Nano bot cloud also can be useful for you directly, these are smart little guys and with some tweaking they might keep you alive in a pinch,

**EDIT**

Skill Tree- ""Just a Little Prick"": This is the more defense buff oriented tree. here there are skills for health, shields, but also for buffing allies and keeping everyone in the fight

- Increased health regen while nano burst is on cooldown
- Deals spike damage to melee enemies 
- The cloud will increase the amount of time you or an ally can be in FFYL
- Heal allies who walk through the nano bot cloud
- If Nanoburst in ready and you enter FFYL the nano bots create a cloud shaped like yourself and allow you to continue fighting like normal. if you get a kill you get up just like before, but the nano bots aren't nearly as tough as you are so they only have half the shields and 1/4 the health but all of your abilities. 

Now the best part about these nano bots is that they can work together to accomplish impressive things, and to be honest some of them can be pretty offensive.

Skill tree ""Non-Biological Warfare"": now this one is for the gun runners out there. this is all about offense, skills that make you and your friends into killing machines... with tiny little killing machines by your side.

- The Nano Burst swarm will slag enemies
- The Nano Burst will regen ammo while they are not on cool down
- The Nano bots will coat your bullets in themselves turning them into explosive rounds 
- If you walk through the nano cloud you gain increased accuracy and recoil reduction 
- Activating nano burst a second time while active will cause the swarm to attach to your weapon drastically improving it's stats and giving an enemy you kill with it to have a chance to drop a mirv grenade, whose effects differ depending on the type of gun your using.

So there you have it, a large area support class based (loosely) on the bard. Personally I think that he could be pretty fun. 

Let me know what you guys think, any constructive criticism would be appreciated.

So since as long as Zer0's skill trees have been known, I've wanted to play his Sniper spec. So I did. All the way to a thoroughly underwhelming level 20, and then felt completely non-viable for pretty much all forms of combat. The problem with the sniping spec, is the higher you level, the greater the difference between a standard hit and a critical hit becomes. So at level 10 when you body shot an enemy with a sniper, it almost kills them as fast as a headshot would. By the time you reach level 20, it takes three body shots to equal the insta-gib damage of a critical hit. I understand there is intended to be a fair amount of skill involved in making any sniper spec effective in pretty well any FPS game. However, when you're dealing with a vast range of enemies, some who will take really heavy damage and march slowly towards you, and others who will sprint at you from off screen and blow you to smithereens before you realize their presence, and everything in between, it's pretty hard to line up consistent headshots, and sometimes you just have to settle for a body shot. I also tried sniping again at level 50 while trying out a few different class mods, and it still didn't feel very viable. Also, sniper class mods are a total crap-chute because you either sacrifice survivability for damage output, or damage output for survivability, whereas other mods don't tend to nerf certain abilities much at all.

So at level 20, I made the switch to Bloodshed. Coupling the spec with the Law pistol, it was great fun to play and I had decent survivability, which made the game overall less ridiculously stressful. However as mob health pools grew exponentially faster than my melee damage, and enemies got more and more badass, it stopped feeling useful by about level 28. Once again, I've tried the spec again at 50, with a few different melee weapon/shield combinations, and I still couldn't put enough damage to make that final skill in the tree useful, unless I was fighting some Varkid Larvae.

Finally I decided to switch to Cunning, seeing it as a viable damage spec that made pretty well all weapon types accessible. It certainly did the job. I had a lot of fun finishing PT1 with it, and using SMGs became a big highlight of the game for me. Cunning also has decent survivability, mixed with good gun damage, which made Eridium Blight onwards a total breeze. I decided to wait until 40 to step into TVHM, and I'm glad I did. I don't know how it would have worked out at 36 when I finished PT1, because even at 40, I got torn apart. I experience death after death, no matter how much I geared up, and I honestly hated the game and class fully and completely for a good while. But I persisted, painfully, and still do, because it's the only spec that I can get by on.

Playing with friends, when someone else is around to take some of the enemy attention is helpful, and can make sniping a little easier, but even then, Cunning just outshines both Sniping and Bloodshed. I know this isn't some PvP MMO that needs to be super balanced or anything, but I feel ripped off that a class made strictly for damage output, has equal (or less) potential damage output than other classes who have a much more dynamic set of skill trees that are based on more than just short, medium and long range fighting styles, especially when he has absolutely no crowd control abilities.

I'm not demanding a fix, or some fancy new skill. If I cared that much, I'd play a different class (which I have been), but I'm just really disappointed over a character I was looking forward to play for a long while and thought I'd share my sadness in this fact.

I've seen countless threads in which people seeking help with playing Zer0 are constantly being told to go Cunning spec, so I can't be the only one who's had these findings.

TL;DR: Zer0 has disappointed me in his lack of damage output for a strictly damage oriented class.

EDIT: Really appreciate the discussion. Obviously there are people on a varying spectrum of feelings about Zer0 as a character. I just wanted to say, I'm not indignant about Gearbox and how they've made Zer0. Obviously he suits some people. Ultimately I'm just upset with how he stacks up to my expectations I suppose.

EDIT 2: Something I meant to mention in my original post was that I love Zer0 on boss encounters. With his ridiculous reload speed and quick elemental damage application, you can rack up massive damage (see 6 second solo Hyperius kill). Single target fights really play well into Rising Sh0t as well.

FINAL EDIT: Thanks to everyone who contributed to conversation and expressed their thoughts. It was good to share my feels and see other peoples' views and strategies.

-----------------------

Ok, enough with the silly in character sales pitch.  It's a save for each character, legitimately* built, at level 6 starting in Sanctuary.  I was shooting for a Level 5 character, but it turns out that's actually impossible.  There's more details in the enclosed readme.txt, but these were all made by playing them through to that point in-game, doing only the story missions required to get into sanctuary, only killing what needs to be killed to move the story along to there, and still leaving everything else in the game for the player to do.

*: The only thing I did was use Cheat Engine to lock my shields and HP at max for effective God Mode.  This didn't affect stats or leveling in any way, did not modify the savegame in any way, and it was the only illegitimate thing I used.  I basically had to do it, though.  Using that it took me 45 minutes to an hour for each run, and a lot of that was standing around getting shot.  Without godmode running, it would have simply been impossible to get to Sanctuary with no sidequests even acknowledged and at such a low level.  Other than that though, the saves are completely natural.  There was no hex editing involved, and they're all just like they would be if you started a character up yourself and managed to luck yourself to Sanctuary at level 6.

Hopefully someone will get some use out of these.  I haven't seen a starter pack or anything posted here before.  I know after starting brand new five times in a row I sure as Hell never want to be forced through the intro again, and now hopefully nobody has to.

Also, I tested this with a friend, and it worked fine for him.  If there's any sort of issues with this though, let me know and I'll see what I can do.

**Unique Quest Pistols**

***Dahl Dahlminator***

    Quest: The Lost Treasure (Sawtooth Cauldron/ Caustic Caverns)
    Quest Level: ???
    Quest Reward Level: ???
    Playthrough 2 Usefulness: High
    Playthrough 2.5 Usefulness: Low

*I feel that the Dahlminator is quite worth using, and maybe even worth farming. It does great damage, is always corrosive, and usually has good other stats. It's great for second winds in hyperion areas since you barely have to aim, and also good for taking out troublesome constructors and SB Loaders since you can still hit by firing it around cover and letting it home in. I guess it depends on playstyle and such but I for one love the thing.*

***Hyperion Fibber***

    Quest: A Real Boy: Human (Eridium Blight)
    Quest Level: ???
    Quest Reward Level: ???
    Playthrough 2 Usefulness: Low
    Playthrough 2.5 Usefulness: Medium/High, Depending on which variant of the fibber you want.

*It's entirely worth waiting til' 2.5 to farm this gun, depending on the parts/variant of the gun (ricochet-type or multi-projectile) it can do decent damage for a very cheap bullet cost. During playthrough 2, it's still a powerhouse, but since you're already in the eridium blight, endgame scaling is right around the corner.*

***Hyperion Lady Fist***

    Quest: Uncle Teddy (Arid Nexus - Badlands) (Turn in the mission to Una Baha)
    Quest Level: ???
    Quest Reward Level: ???
    Playthrough 2 Usefulness: Low/Medium
    Playthrough 2.5 Usefulness: Medium/High

*Decent Hyperion pistol, everything you expect. MASSIVE critical bonus, however. Can work very well with crit-based builds, It doesn't shine very well at the point you get it in the game (loaders are odd..) And i haven't seen it ever have an element. But a Redundant prefix (Double fire) can make this gun sing, when it connects with a sweet spot, that is. However, it's still not worth farming unless you have endgame crits in mind.*

***Jakobs Law***

    Quest: Won't Get Fooled Again (Sanctuary)
    Quest Level: ???
    Quest Reward Level: ???
    Playthrough 2 Usefulness: High
    Playthrough 2.5 Usefullness: High/Ultra-High

*When Paired with the Order Shield, It heals for 100% of your melee damage, this is one of the setups that absolutely MAKES melee characters (one of). The law is great even in the middle of playthrough 2, but for that endgame smack n' heal, you're going to want to hold off til jack is good and dead.*

***Moxxi's Rubi (Maliwan)***

    Quest: Rakkaholics Anonymous (Sanctuary/ The Dust) (Turn in to moxxi)
    Quest Level: ???
    Quest Reward Level: ???
    Playthrough 2 Usefulness: Medium
    Playthrough 2.5 Usefulness: High

*There are threads in both Gaige and Zero forums that suggest high to perhaps very high value for both the Rubi pistol and Hail assault rifle. A Rubi, evisceration to be more exact, heals for the most amount of damage out of all of Moxxi's guns (25%) and effects all damage when wielded (counting grenades and melee). Thus combined with a Love Thumper and slag element, you've got a cross between the Law + Order builds and Slag Rapier + Love Thumper builds.*

***Dahl Teapot***

    Quest: You Are Cordially Invited: Tea Party (Tundra Express)
    Quest Level: ???
    Quest Reward Level: ???
    Playthrough 2 Usefulness: Medium
    Playthrough 2.5 Usefulness: Medium

*A gun i've never really payed attention to, it feels just like another corrosive Dahl to me. I've read that it's stats make it somewhat of a Hornet Jr. when obtained in 2.5. During playthrough 2, it makes for a fantastic armor melter, and can really put the hurt on those loaders later on in the story.*

***Vladof Veritas***

    Quest: Clan War: Wakey Wakey (The Highlands) (One of 2 possible Unique Rewards)
    Quest Level: ???
    Quest Reward Level: ???
    Playthrough 2 Usefulness: Low
    Playthrough 2.5 Usefulness: Low

*A gimmicky gun. To be used with friends all running gimmicky equipment just to have gimmicky stats that can't amount to much when the gun lacks any real punching power (no more than any other vladof machine pistol). Not worth keeping unless you have some sort of gimmicky boss run planned (true friends required)*

**Unique Quest Shotguns**

***Moxxi's Heart Breaker (Hyperion)***

    Quest: Safe And Sound (Sanctuary/ Caustic Caverns) (Turn in to Moxxi)
    Quest Level: ???
    Quest Reward Level: ???
    Playthrough 2 Usefulness: High
    Playthrough 2.5 Usefulness: High

*Openly admitting i'm in love with this gun. Fixed fire pattern that's easy to aim, always incendiary, elemental DOT healing (boosted by amp damage), and it's a hyperion, so added accuracy while you're holding the trigger down. It turns fleshy enemies into goo as long as it's not madly outleveled (scaling is a bitch). Endgame, it's arguably one of the best single-shell shotguns in the game (only other one that comes to mind is the CC, and that's a Hyperion too). Worth grabbing during the story for it's sheer usefulness, and worth farming if you are planning to build around it.*

***Torgue Landscaper***

    Quest: Clan War: Hodunks vs. Zafords (The Dust) (If you side with the Hodunks)
    Quest Level: ???
    Quest Reward Level: ???
    Playthrough 2 Usefulness: Low
    Playthrough 2.5 Usefulness: Low

*It... just doesn't fire enough projectiles to be of any use.. Not to mention the odd firing angle, odd fire pattern, and odd everything else.. Not worth keeping, but siding with the hodunks gives you the ability to farm the Zafords for a Jakobs Maggie. You can only win for losing, i guess.*

***Tediore Octo***

    Quest: Slap Happy (Sanctuary/ The Highlands - Outwash)
    Quest Level: ???
    Quest Reward Level: ???
    Playthrough 2 Usefulness: Low/Medium
    Playthrough 2.5 Usefulness: Low

*Slow-firing projectiles that are easy to aim but hard to hit with. Poor endgame damage with no significant bonuses. A decent shotgun during the storyline only if it does more damage than your current.*

***Bandit RokSalt***

    Quest: Splinter Group (Sanctuary/ Bloodshot Stronghold)
    Quest Level: ???
    Quest Reward Level: ???
    Playthrough 2 Usefulness: Medium
    Playthrough 2.5 Usefulness: Low

*Your average bandit shotgun, Decent stats.. and it has a reload speed like you wouldn't believe. With a good prefix/parts, this gun can be very forgiving to your storyline progress (Bonus to critical, accuracy, or general boost). Endgame... it's just another bandit shotgun. Worth doing this quest as it comes up, don't bother saving it for later.*

***Hyperion Shotgun 1340***

    Quest: Out Of Body Experience (Bloodshot Stronghold/ Sanctuary) (Turn in to Marcus)
    Quest Level: ???
    Quest Reward Level: ???
    Playthrough 2 Usefulness: Medium/High
    Playthrough 2.5 Usefulness: Low

*The ""Bro-gun"" as i like to call it. Solid shotgun all around, and he talks. Period. Great guy. Likes to kill and crit and doesn't afraid of anything. Completely outshined endgame. Take this quest as it comes, he don't get no better.*

***Jakobs Tidal Wave***

    Quest: Uncle Teddy (Arid Nexus - Badlands) (Turn in to Hyperion)
    Quest Level: ???
    Quest Reward Level: ???
    Playthrough 2 Usefulness: Low
    Playthrough 2.5 Usefulness: Low

*I don't have much to say about this gun. Mediocre damage, odd bullet pattern that has no useful place in the game, just blame hyperion for letting jakobs manufacture it.*

***Jakobs Triquetra***
    Quest: Clan War: End of the Rainbow (The Highlands - Outlook)

    Playthrough 2 Usefulness: Low/Medium

**Unique Quest Combat Rifles**

***Torgue Evil Smasher***

    Quest: The Chosen One (Sanctuary/ Sawtooth Cauldron)
    Quest Level: ???
    Quest Reward Level: ???
    Playthrough 2 Usefulness: Ultra-Low* (*See: Ultra-High)
    Playthrough 2.5 Usefulness: Ultra-Low* (*See: Ultra-High)

*If you don't know why this gun is of ultra-high usefulness.. I won't be the one to tell you.. To the rest of you who keep an Evil Smasher in your 4th slot.. Walk softly and smash strongly. I simply advise that no one ever toss this gun. Ever.*

***Vladof Hail***

    Quest: Bandit Slaughter Dome: Round 3 (The Fridge)
    Quest Level: ???
    Quest Reward Level: ???
    Playthrough 2 Usefulness: Low
    Playthrough 2.5 Usefulness: Medium/High

*I don't want to misspeak but from what I understand, a Hail does twice as much damage from what its card says and the projectiles bounce on the ground. Combine this with electric element, a catalyst mod, and Close Enough and you've got chaos if you're able to aim correctly (learning curve.)*

***Dahl Scorpio***

    Quest: Bearer of Bad News (Sanctuary)
    Quest Level: ???
    Quest Reward Level: ???
    Playthrough 2 Usefulness: High
    Playthrough 2.5 Usefulness: Medium

*Amidst all the bad news, this is a fantastic rifle. Decent in every aspect, and it's entirely possible to get one with an element (haven't scored a double-tap variant yet, if it exists). Great gun to get you through the last bit of the game. Also worth saving til endgame to acquire.*

***Jakobs Stomper***

    Quest: Hungry Like the Skag (Arid Nexus - Badlands)
    Quest Level: ???
    Quest Reward Level: ???
    Playthrough 2 Usefulness: Medium
    Playthrough 2.5 Usefulness: Medium?

*Along with openly admitting i love the Heart Breaker, i'll openly admit i hate Jakob's combat rifles. But from what i've seen, this gun has very solid damage, and with a massive bonus to critical, i'd assume it's actually decent. Probably wouldn't hurt to pick this up endgame.*

**Unique Reward Sniper Rifles**

***Jakobs Buffalo***

    Quest: Demon Hunter (Lynchwood)
    Quest Level: ???
    Quest Reward Level: ???
    Playthrough 2 Usefulness: High
    Playthrough 2.5 Usefulness: High

*Awesome sniper rifle, reminds me very much of the Elephant gun from the first game, with fantastic damage and a big critical bonus. Not much else to say, if you like snipers, get this one at some point.*

***Maliwan Chère-amie***

    Quest: Hyperion Slaughter Dome: Round 5 (Ore Chasm)
    Quest Level: ???
    Quest Reward Level: ???
    Playthrough 2 Usefulness: Medium
    Playthrough 2.5 Usefulness: Medium

*Kind of hard to use the transfusion effect, because at close range.. You don't really need a sniper, and at long range, the transfusion effect seems to fire off at a random direction that happens to be AWAY from you. Other than that, average maliwan sniper.*

***Hyperion Morningstar***

    Quest: Hyperion Contract 873 (The Highlands - Outlook)
    Quest Level: ???
    Quest Reward Level: ???
    Playthrough 2 Usefulness: Low/Medium
    Playthrough 2.5 Usefulness: Low/Medium

*Admittedly a decent sniper rifle... if you mute the sound. It also looks pretty, but again, it nags the **** out of you. Not worth bothering about unless you have an odd fixation with sniper rifles.*

***Dahl Sloth***

    Quest: Rakkaholics Anonymous (Sanctuary/ The Dust) (Turn in to Mordecai)
    Quest Level: ???
    Quest Reward Level: ???
    Playthrough 2 Usefulness: Low
    Playthrough 2.5 Usefulness: Medium/High

*Odd gun to use.. Very odd. But endgame stats are something to be proud of. This sniper rifle outdamages near everything when level 50 (short of maybe a jakobs) But you'll probably only ever hit the first enemy in a camp, before everything start running around like headless chickens and you can no longer land a shot. If you're gonna farm it, wait til jack be dead.*

***Jakobs Tresspasser***

    Quest: Animal Rights (Wildlife Exploitation Preserve)
    Quest Level: ???
    Quest Reward Level: ???
    Playthrough 2 Usefulness: Medium
    Playthrough 2.5 Usefulness: Low/Medium

*Great sniper, even for the reduced (comparitive) damage numbers. It ignores shields. This is good. If you're playing your vault hunter as a sniper, get this gun. by endgame there are far better outright damaging sniper rifles, however.*

**Unique Quest Reward Rocket Launchers**

***Torgue Creamer***

    Quest: Creature Slaughter Dome: Round 5 (Natural Selection Annex)
    Quest Level: ???
    Quest Reward Level: ???
    Playthrough 2 Usefulness: High
    Playthrough 2.5 Usefulness: Medium/High

*A fantastic damage rocket launcher, especially in a game where, during your playthrough, rocket launchers are about as rare as legendary weapons (okay, maybe not THAT rare... lol drop rates). A great second-wind generator handed to you by the game itself. If you've been having a hard time, pick this up asap. But a level 50 version has wild and deadly potential.*

***Bandit Roaster***

    Quest: Note for Self-Person (The Fridge)
    Quest Level: ???
    Quest Reward Level: ???
    Playthrough 2 Usefulness: Medium
    Playthrough 2.5 Usefulness: Medium

*I actually haven't used this rocket launcher endgame, so i'm not totally sure of it's damage potential. It's overall decent, just another rocket launcher that the game gives you, which is always good. You may not be going out of your way to farm this quest reward, however.*

    Quest Level: ???
    Quest Reward Level: ???
    Playthrough 2 Usefulness: Low/High
    Playthrough 2.5 Usefulness: Low/High

*You either love it or you hate it. An amazing SMG in the stats, with incredibly high damage, clip size, and fire rate. But it may drive you completely insane.... Hell, that is the ""curse"" afterall. If you can deal with the madness it brings, by all means take it. Especially at level 50.*

*Sporting a more fitting curse than the bane or even anything that Captain Blade can whip up. Increasing damage done to you while proc'ing slag and shock all at the same time (which makes it fantastic for bringing enemies down). It doesn't really stand out much during PT2, and feels kinda gimmicky. But at level 50 it's a good choice to shred shields, especially when you have skills that increase your durability and increase your elemental damage.*

It's actually sought after, being a legendary and all, too many people just take the quest for granted and settle for their underlevel version.

I hope Rev. Burch can work in some story to reveal some of the specifics as to the apparent plot holes when it's time to kill off an NPC, or NOT permanently kill off the player.

I've thought about this, and I think there are some good explanations for why this may be. Here is my theory

New-U is sold as a written contract, the terms of which are that Hyperion will enable New-U service for you for a period of time (for example, 6 months). The reason that Hyperion will not break the contract in order to kill off the player is because, from a business perspective, it wouldn't make sense: nobody would risk their life signing a contract with them knowing that it could be revoked. In fact, it could be that some component of digistruct technology actually makes revocation impossible during the contract period.

The Borderlands universe was once a place where New-U was dirt cheap, which is what created the propensity for violence. Don't like someone? Kill them -- no big deal. But something happened (unclear what) that caused the cost to skyrocket, so it's now very rare to have a contract. Shield technology boomed when this happened, followed shortly by gun technology, and the arms race to 87 bazillion was on.

Hyperion provides a free contract to vault hunters as compensation for their services. This is why vault hunters are the world's heroes: no one else on Pandora can afford a contract. Other people don't go out in the dangerous world, if they can avoid it.

So, the important plot points are these: [Jack's attempt to kill the vault hunter on the train was a ruse to get at Sanctuary's shields. When Roland is killed, he was already off of contract. On the other hand, Jack's death is the result of leveraging ALL of his digistruct data at once -- multiple body doubles -- in his mad lust for power. It's possible that Angel has a backup somewhere and is laying low. I still don't trust her.](http://www.reddit.com/spoiler)

Does anyone else have a theory as to what might explain the ""died in a cutscene"" phenomenon?

*edit:* A few people are talking about some of Burch's comments that sound like he regrets adding a voice to the New-U. The quote is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13gsxi/iama_mister_torgue_and_will_answer/c73w94h). My take on this comment is that he **agrees** that it's a story problem (albeit a minor one) now that it's been written in.

TERRAMORPHOUS' VARIOUS ATTACKS:
---
---
**1. Terramorphous' Iconic ""HULK SMASH"":** Terra gets mad and smashes the floor in front of him with his two front tentacles dealing a large area of affect to anyone caught in the attack's sphere of influence. It's important to note that this attack is designed to only bring you down to near death (regardless of level). Though rarely, Terra will throw a bitch-fit and hulk smash the floor multiple times or alternate between his his other ""bitch-slap fling you off the edge"" attack and slaps.

**2. Terramorphous' detested ""BITCH SLAP/S"":** Probably the most infuriating thing Terramorphous can do to any player is slap them out of the ring. In his most infuriating iteration of his slap attack,         Terramorphous will spring out of the floor and whip his two tentacles forward in your direction and hit you out (more often than not out of the ring, (resulting in your death). It is important to note that this attack though having a very long reach, also has a very narrow area of effect. His other slap attacks are not quite as note worthy, but consist of an upper-cut like slap which seems to only have a localized area of effect, and single tentacle slaps which for the most part only induce panic but are easily avoidable.

**3. Terramorphous' Spike Tentacle:** (see below under ""TENTACLES AND THEIR VARIOUS ATTACKS"" For more information on the mechanics of this attack.) This is the same attack that his stand-alone Spike Tentacles will dish out except Terramorphous himself will shoot off several spikes in your direction.

---
TERRAMORPHOUS' TENTACLES AND THEIR VARIOUS ATTACKS:
---
---
Along with Hulk Smashing and Bitch Slapping any unprepared Vault Hunters who wander into his lair and blow on his bone horn, Terramorphous likes to spawn various tentacles around his main shaft that will rape you whenever they get the chance. 

**1. Terramorphous' Spike Tentacle:** One of the first tentacles you are most likely to come in contact with, the Teramorphous Spike Tentacle will track your movements and shoot a spike missile at you dealing respectable damage. At medium to long range, these projectiles are easily seen and avoided as they do not home in on their targets (they merely fly along their projected paths).

**2. Terramorphous' Rock Tentacle:** More often than not, the second set of tentacles that Terra will spawn, The Rock Tentacle has similar mechanics to the Spike Tentacle, except the projectile thrown in this case is a large boulder that has a small area of affect upon impact. These boulders move quite slowly and are easily avoided as long as you are aware of your surroundings and do not corner yourself against any walls.

**3. Terramorphous' Beam Tentacle:** Most likely the third tentacle you will encounter, the Terramorphous Beam Tentacle will track your movements and emit a laser beam that does quite a lot of damage. This tentacle's attacks are harder to avoid than most, especially when there are multiple beams crossing your path. Strafing and shooting the tentacles to avoid the beams is your best bet at staying alive. Sometimes if the angle is not appropriate, you may want to avoid shooting and just focus on sprinting perpendicular to the beam's trajectory (once the beam tentacles have locked on to you and fired, they are slow to move and can be avoided in this fashion).

**4. Terramorphous' Masher Tentacle:** One of the last tentacles to spawn, Terramorphous' Masher tentacle will perform a smash attack akin to Terra's iconic ""HULK SMASH."" But unlike Terramorphous, these tentacles are always relentlessly smashing for the duration that they are above ground. There is also no large area of affect like the regular Hulk Smash attack and these tentacles will only damage you if they physically hit your character. Since these tentacles have a limited range and do not throw projectiles at you, sprinting out of their circle of influence, or strafing around each smash are your best chances at overcoming this tentacle. 

**5. Terramorphous' Fire Tentacle:** These are the last tentacles that you will see when fighting Terramorphous. More often than not they will spawn in conjunction with Terramorphous when he uses his special ability to become a Fyre Thresher (see ""BEAST MODE""). These particular tentacles have the same firing mechanics as the Spike Tentacles but instead of firing a physical spike projectile, they lob a fireball at you. The fireball does respectable damage and will impart a burn effect on your character when hit or if you walk into the fireball's smoldering remains. Unlike the high DoT (damage over time) of Terramorphous' Fire Nova HULK SMASH (see: ""BEAST MODE""), the DoT on these fireballs is relatively low.

---
TERRAMORPHOUS' UNIQUE ABILITY AND ATTACK:
---
---
**1. BEAST MODE (Fire Thresher):** Terramorphous will eventually activate his unique ability by lighting himself on fire. While on fire his durability against any attacks goes up and he becomes fire resistent/immune (depending on your level differences). While in Beast Mode, Terramorphous HULK SMASH attack will also generate a Fire Nova. Being hit by this nova is nearly a guaranteed death. The only way you will be able to survive is by generating enough health to counter-act the Fire Nova's extremely high DoT. The likely hood of being able to do that is slim, especially when considering that your character will have taken the base AoE damage from Terra's HULK SMASH in addition to the damage now imparted from the Fire Nova's DoT. 

**2. BLACK HOLE OF (NEAR) GUARANTEED DEATH:** Terramorphous will at times randomly generate a black hole which will suck every player in the ring towards the center, sealing their fates. If not prepared, this will more often than not spell the end to a Raid Team's efforts at defeating Terramorphous (you need at least one person alive in the ring at all times or Terramorphous will reset his health back to max). It is important to note that ~~Terra will only spawn his black hole when AT LEAST ONE PERSON IS OUTSIDE OF THE RING~~ THIS SHIT IS COMPLETELY RANDOM AND TERRA CAN CHOOSE TO FUCK YOU AT ANY TIME IN ANY CONTEXT. It comes down to pure luck that you have at least one person outside the ring to come in once his/her team mates have been killed by the black hole. It is this person/s job to make sure that the fight will continue and Terra will not reset his health once all other party members have died. Timing is crucial. Jump too soon and you too shall die at the black hole's hand. Jump too late and Terramorphous' health will have reset and your team will have to start over once again. It may be advantageous for your Raid Squad to consider the addition of at least one Commando on the team that has skills invested in the Sabre Turret's Phalanx Shield (as this shield is able to negate the effects of the black hole for anyone residing inside of it).

VARIOUS STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESS!!:
---
---
I find that the best defense is the best offense when fighting Terramorphous. And though that may be the case, defeating Terramorphous is really all about your team's survival. As long as one person is the ring to keep Terramorphous aroused, the fight will continue. He who lasts longest is strongest.

Here are some basic tips on guaranteeing your prolonged survival against Terramorphous. 

**1. Never stay in once place too long, always keep moving:** This is the number one rule because this rule also happens to be number one killer of Vault Hunters if not followed. Most players become intimidated when fighting Terramorphous and fear getting smashed or flung off the edge. It's this fear that drives them to hug walls or to hide behind one of the two rocks near the center of the map. This is not a very good strategy, and will in fact lead these players to be hit off the map or smashed more often than had they moved around to avoid Terramorphous' attacks.

**Why is this the case?**
Terramorphous will pop his head out of the ground and single out one player to either smash or slap. If you happen to be hiding behind one of the two rocks, this means that you are already closer to the edge. Therefore, when Terramorphous finally does attack you (his smash and slap attacks go through the rocks), you will go FLYING off the edge of the map. This is even worse if you try to ""jump"" to evade his attacks (you won't evade them). Being in the air while hit by Terramorphous' slap will nearly guarantee your death by flying out of the ring. Resist the urge to jump. 

For those that prefer to hug the back wall closely, Terramorphous will oftentimes pop out right in front of you and relentlessly smash the shit out of your character as you are cornered and bleeding at his mercy. 

**What should i do then?** Your goal should be to persuade Terramorphous to pop out from the very center of the ring as often as possible. When popping out from the center, Terramorphous' slap attacks will not hit you off the edge. You will merely be hit towards the edge. Terramorphous' smash attack will only fling you into the air, giving you enough distance to land safely back into the ring. 

You can use certain Terramorphous mechanics to your advantage. Instead of hugging walls and hiding behind rocks like a little bitch, try rushing the center of the map every chance you get. Look at the ground and notice the little mount of dirt moving around, this will tell you where Terramorphous will pop up next. Stand right where this mound is and wait for him to pop up. Once Terramorphous pops up, he will fling you up vertically into the air (but you will not take any damage from this, which is great for those with Bee Shields). Take this opportunity to lay down some fire on Terra and try to reposition your descent BEHIND where Terramorphous is currently facing. More often than not, Terramorphous will have already done his smash attack/slap while you are in the air (which you will have handily avoided). But if not, when you land, Terra might decide to do a 180 degree turn and smash/slap you. Just take the damage. The smash will not kill you in one hit, and the slap will not fling you off the edge. Go collect some health from his tentacles or bathe in some transfusion grenade plus signs. 

In regards to the two rocks near the center of the ring. Their utility as cover should only apply to beams and projectiles being launched at your player. In terms of using them as protection against Terramorphous' smashes and slaps, standing in front of the rocks will actually be more beneficial for you as instead of possibly flying off the edge of the ring, you will just fly into the rock instead.

**2. Always go for his tentacles first!:** More often than not, it's actually Terramorphous' tentacles that will kill you. If you follow the tips i laid out in rule one, you are already minimizing the amount of damage Terramorphous can dish out and increasing your survival rate. Killing Terramorphous' tentacles will drop loads of healing hypo's, ammo, and grenades. These are all things that are necessary to keep the fight going. Also, these drops are another incentive for you to NOT camp, as you will be unable to pick up these goodies unless you move around the map. More grenades means more transfusions giving you health at a given time. More hypo's on the ground means that your chances of counteracting Terramorphous' Fire Nova DoT are increased as you can run over the hypo's to stay above zero health. Ammo is important, how else are you going to keep that amped Conference Call of yours loaded throughout the match? (joke). Also, aim for the tentacles' critical point (the yellow/orange eye in the center of the tentacle).

**3. Use Fire Elemental Weapons Where Applicable!:**Terramorphous is a ""flesh"" based enemy as designated by his red health bar. This means that on True Vault Hunter Mode, he will take an increase in 1.75x damage when hit with Fire elemental weapons. However, using fire against Terramorphous is only applicable when he is not in BEAST MODE (see: BEAST MODE). You are otherwise still able to attack all of Terra's tentacles (including Fire Tentacles), and receive the multiplier bonus. When he does become a fire thresher, it's best to swap out your fire weapon for something non elemental, or shock based (as shock does not have any weaknesses) when attacking his main shaft.

**4. Save Yourself:** Know how you can be a hero? Not by saving your friend's ass and possibly getting killed in the process. It's by staying alive. When in doubt, don't bother saving your friends. Focus on staying alive first and foremost. Only revive others when it's absolutely clear that you will not die in the process.

HOW TO BE A TEAM PLAYER:
---
---
**1. Follow all the rules listed above in the section labeled as ""Various Strategies for Success"".**

**2. Play your character.** As in, contribute your class' unique ability as often as possible. 

**Gunzerkers (Salvador) [Gunzerking]** should focus on what they do best, killing things quickly and staying alive (tentacle point man). Using their action skill combined with skills for faster movement speed and increased aggro (come at me bro) to kite attacks away from teammates. Being able to throw two grenades at the price of one means double the amount of transfusions in the air at a given time.

**Assassins (Zer0) [Deception]** Should death mark as often as possible. All assassins in a team based setting should invest in the Cunning tree to be able to deathmark at range. (and to also inflict status effects on lvl 52 Terramorphous).

**Sirens (Maya) [Phaselock]** You are the healers of the party. Your job is to res someone when they are down. Most Sirens may also be the team's ""designated slagger,"" With your elemental bonus' you will be able to readily slag a lvl 52 Terramorphous. On the topic of reviving someone when they are in Fight For Your Life, it's sometimes best to revive them as late as possible as this will give them ample time to possibly get a kill revive and for you to not waste your action skill. 

**Commandos (Axton) [Sabre Turret(Girlfriend)]** ~~are sadly not as useful against Terramorphous as other classes may be (Just my observation).~~ As a soldier, you can have the option of placing turrets on the ground to possibly attract fire from Terra's various attacks (though turret's do not last long in TVHM). Or you can place turrets on the ceiling (need longbow turret skill) where the Vault Symbol is so they are not as readily destroyed by smashes and slaps. Soldiers can also use their turrets to slag lvl 52 Terramorphous. It has been confirmed via the comments that you can indeed use the Commando's Sabre turret when equipped with the phalanx shield ability to negate the vortex effect generated by Terramorphous' black hole. 

**Mechromancers (Gaige) [Death Trap]** Mechromancers do not have the same utility as other characters in team based play. Deathtrap is readily killed by higher level Terramorphii and can only contribute to the team by replenishing shields (Buck Up skill) (which can be handy when Bee shield's need topping off).

THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND WHEN FIGHTING A HIGHER LEVEL TERRAMORPHOUS (Level 65+)
---
---

Assuming you are at the current level cap (50), and are looking for a challenge, you may take a look at this thread, [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/12zo6t/how_to_make_your_game_more_challenging_andor/), for information on how to alter the level that Terramorphous spawns at. 

1. He cannot take on any status effects. That means, burned, corroded, shocked, or slagged. His level is just far too high relative to yours.

2. Unless you have a very cohesive team that follows all the rules i outlined above, you will want at least 1, or 2 Sirens in your squad. I have found that a mix of sirens and gunzerkers works best (one assassin for deathmark may also be favorable).

3. DPS is King and will improve your survival rate. A bee shield is necessary at this level. A bee shield with tediore shield parts (you can use a save editor to check what parts your bee shield has) will enable you to have a base recharge time of 3.13 seconds. Faster recharge trumps higher amp damage as you will be amped far more often (no point in having high amp damage if you can't use it). Conference calls are the weapon of choice when fighting a large boss such as Terramorphous. The gun's unique ability to spawn perpendicular bullets along the original blast's trajectory will do massive (lol not really) damage against Terramorphous. Norfleets (or any other high base damage weapon) may get you a kill revive in fight for your life.

4. Gunzerker should be the host whenever possible. Gunzerker's can dual wield two weapons (most likely conference calls) at a time. When not hosting, you will typically see a lot of delay in recoil calculation (it will take quite a while for your recoil to subside), also your shots will for whatever reason not shoot straight and will first hit the ground until the recoil and lag sync up. Things can also get quite laggy when you fire two amped conference calls as the game will attempt to generate all the particle affects for every single amped pellet that you fire.

Everything before level 5 is a snooze fest, with no skill building and no decent loot besides the occasional green rarity pistol.  Even levels 6 and 7 only present you with 2 skill points which barely allows any noticeable advancement of your character's build at all.  You can't even really begin forming your play style and strategy until level 5-7 anyway, as getting your action skill and starting down one of the 3 skill tree paths completely shapes your strategy.

I really don't think we would be losing anything to unlock the ability to FF to Sanctuary / Level 8 (with 3 skill points waiting to be spent) after the player reaches Sanctuary normally on one character.

I'd really like to try all the characters, but it's annoying to play through the first 3 hours of the game with no skills or powers and crappy pistols... 4 different times.

Just added another 654 spins of my own and over 500 from you guys. I can't see the +5% rare loot artifact having any appreciable effect on the numbers, nor the difference in character levels. [Here's 2782 spins](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/2126504/keeps/pandoran-slot-machines-day-3.JPG)  

**EDIT 23/09/2012:**  
I went and ground another 1038 spins and added those into a new pie chart, the numbers are very similar showing that to get an orange weapon or the megabucks money payout you're looking at less than 0.06% chance.  
[New pie chart](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/2126504/keeps/pandoran-slot-machines-day-2.JPG)  
  
**Original post 23/09/2012:**
Decided to start logging my slot machine results. I went and spent all the money I have on all of my characters, [here is the result of 572 spins](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/2126504/keeps/pandoran-slot-machines-day-1.JPG)
Results of the spins, machine locations etc can be [found here](http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Slot_Machine).  
  
26.6% of spins result in absolutely zero yield, almost all the 48% of 2/3 matches result in a net loss of money (taking into account weapon sale price). So as stated by Gearbox, if you're looking to make money on the slots you're going to be bitterly disappointed. To hammer that home: over 68% of spins will result in a net loss.  
15% of the time you'll get a green weapon and barely break even.  
3% of spins result in Eridium haul, I honestly thought it was higher than this before I started counting. The graphic shows triple Eridium as 0% but it was 0.17%  
  
**If you want to help count:**  
Send me your totals for each category along with screenshots of your excel tally or a photo of your paper tally (if you're doing it with a pen then transferring to excel like I am). This is so I can verify you're not pulling numbers out of your ass/naturally poor memory.  
If you get a triple bell, record how much money you got (*as well as the cost of that spin*), record your orange loot too if you get triple vaults. This is for everyone else to see what what slots can give you rather than my record keeping.

My method was slag them and get them down to less than 30% health (for killing blow). Then go into deception, go behind them (for backstab &amp; ambush), aim for the head, and execute at the last second with the rapier.  

However, the damage could have been a lot higher. I couldn't apply kuni without killing them so that could have been another +80% (kuni deathmarks will glitch and stack if you throw them fast enough). I didn't have like the wind, which would've been +15%. I didn't have rising shot active either, which would've been +45%. And I can't remember if counter strike was active, which is +250%.

**Playstation Network Store** usually updates *around* 6pm EDT, 3pm PDT.

**Update:** Due to Tuesday's scheduled maintenance to the Playstation Network, the **PSN store will update ""at an unspecified time tonight""**.

These are just rough times when the stores usually update, and can vary by a few hours. From what I read the Playstation store in particular is bad at keeping to a consistent update time, so that update could range a few hours earlier or later. ~~(So, you PS3 players, don't take Tuesday off from work because the update might not even be live by the time you get off.)~~

Those times above are for US and Canada. If the stores update worldwide, the times in **BST** should be 8am for XBox, 6pm for Steam, and 11pm for PS3.

Greetings, fellow Vault Hunters. Welcome to the academy for aspiring ninjas such as yourself. This is supposed to be a guide for all of you, and you may contribute in the comments by giving me certain topics to go over. If you want to know something about a certain item or similar, leave it in the comments!

**Melee Formula: How Melee Damage is calculated**
The general formula for melee on Zer0 looks like this: (Base+Roid) x Ambush x Backstab x Execute x Killing Blow x [Weapon Bonus x (%Deception + %Iron Hand + %Counter Strike + %Rising Shot + %Be Like Water + %Followtrough + %Like The Wind + %Class Mod + %BadAssRank) + 0. Relic Percentage] x Slag x Crit x Death Mark

A Level 61 characters Base Melee Damage is equal to 34580. Roid damage is the bonus damage added from your Roid Shield, if it is depleted.

Weapon Bonus is for Bayonet Accesories. 200% on the Rapier, 100% on the Law Revolver, 50% for anything else with a blade on it (Example: Evisceration Rubi)

Critical Hits double your Damage, as usual. Backstab gets up to 88% percent maximum at 11 points (boosted by a Ninja class mod). For better damage output, go for Crits. If possible, use Deception to get behind the enemy and hit them in their Critical Spot(s).

A 'perfect' set up can get you a 60.48 Multiplier on your Melee Damage (this includes Counter Strike proccing and Killing Blow activating). The highest Multiplier possible is 155.52, using a Lethal Ninja Class Mod.

**Equipment: The Ninja's Arsenal**

Weapons:

*Rapier: Unique Quest Reward obtained from 'Message in a Bottle' quest, located in Hayters Folly. Always spawn with a Blade accessory, boosting the weapons Melee Damage to 200%. This is the highest possible Blade attachment damage. A Slag version is preferred and can be obtained by dashboarding/Alt+F4ing/quitting without saving to turn the quest in over and over. Drawback(s): Low Damage, Low chance to apple DoTs (8%), User takes increased Melee Damage while weapon is in their hands,

*Law: Unique Quest Reward obtained from 'Won't Get Fooled Again' quest or as a rare drop from the Sheriff of Lynchwood. The Quest can be done after completing 'Wildlife Preservation'. Always spawns with a Blade accessory, boosting the weapons Melee Damage to 100%. Can not spawn with an Element (manufactured by Jakobs). For maximum efficiency, use in conjunction with the 'Order' Roid shield.

*Slag Evisceration Rubi: Unique Quest Reward obtained from 'Rakkaholics Anonymous' quest, and turning the mission in to Moxxi.No Accessories guaranteed. It will take a while to aquire the correct version (Slag + Blade accessory).  This gun sports a ~23% percent chance to inflict elemantal DoTs/Status Effects. Also, 12.5% percent of damage done with the weapon in hand heals the wielder. With a decent Roid Shield, one Melee Strike can fully heal the Player!

*Evisceration Little Evie: Unique Drop obtained from Mr. Bubbles in Magnys Lighthouse. You will not gain the reward if you hurt Lil' Sis during the fight, so watch out! Mr. Bubbles is nto a guaranteed spawn. This gun is always Shock Elemental, and has a high chance to shock nad a big firerate for a Maliwan Pistol. Holding the weapon while inflicting damage increases the Action Skill Cooldown Rate by 12%. This pistol isn't required, but I enjoy using it for fast cooldowns.

Shields:

*Love Thumper: Unique Quest Reward obtained from 'Best Mother's Day Ever' quest located in The Highlands. This quest randomly drops from Stalkers after completing 'Stalker of Stalkers'. This shield always spawns witha huge Recharge Delay and causes an explosive Nova every time a melee strike hits an enemy. It also hurts teammates, so don't get too close to them while using this shield. The Max Roid damage for this shield is 150765 at Level 61. This requires two parts of the shield to be made by Maliwan and the Shield having an immunity to Fire/Corrosion/Shock damage. This is generally accepted as the best shield for fighting normal enemies.

*Hide of Terramorphuos: Legendary Drop obtained from Terramorpheus the Invincible. The Maximum Roid damage for this shield hits at 211625, so basically like a truck. It fires a Fire Nova when depleted, and deals Fire Spike damage to Melee attackers. This is generally the best Shield for fighting Raid Bosses, since it has the highest damage output.

*Order: Unique Quest Reward obtained from the mission 'BFFs' located in Sanctuary. This quest will show up after 'Won't get fooled again' and 'Where Angels Fear To Thread' are completed. When used together with the earlier mentioned Law Revolver, all Melee damage heals the Wielder. With perfect parts (Max Roid damage) the shield deals 147999 Roid damage. This is lowest out of all Uniqe Roid shield choices. Unless used with the LAw, I advise against the use of this shield, since you can get more damage done with a Hide or a Love Thumper.

*Pun-Chee: Unique Seraph item obtained from trading with the Seraph Vendor in the Badass Crater of Badassitude. With the best parts, the shield hits with 152494 Roid damage. I generally dislike this shield thanks to it's decreased recharge delay and increased capacity. 

Grenades:

*Stormfront: Legendary Grenade Mod dropped from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Rats located in Bloodshot Stronghold. Always Shock Element, therefore great for breaking your shield. Lobbed/Longbow with a 0.0 Fuse is best.

*Chain Lightning/Lightning Bolt: Legendary/Unique Grenade Mod dropped from Sorcerers in the 4th DLC. Always Shock Element. Great alternative to the STormfront, also regenerates ammo over time. Always spawn with a 0.0 Fuse, so you should be good to go.

**Skill Tree  Setups: How to make the most of your character**

Generally, most Melee Zer0 players use a build like this (Level 61): http://imgur.com/hhmSmXM

At Level 50, two builds are used for Raid Bosses/General Play: http://imgur.com/IEfrGl7,SwnvyfG

You may switch up skill points as you see fit, if you enjoy shooting and meleeing, drop points in Be Like Water etc. There is no 'ultimate' setup, as it comes down to user preference. 

Some Notes about certain Skills:

Ambush is active while in deception. Therefore, I'd rather put points into this than Fearless (plus, we don't need Fire Rate since we aren't shooting). Also provides good Co-Op Synergy.

Grim is no good when using a Roid Shield. If you get one kill, your shield is replenished, getting rid of your Roid damage. That being said, it is useful for gun-based Zer0 builds.

Unforeseen works with every Decoy you put out, so using it with Many Must Fall is good for getting rid of Psychos and the like.

Rising Shot works with Melee attacks. Spam your Melee Button at an enemy and you'll be at 5 stacks quite quickly. Plus, you build up stacks while chaining kills together. 

Two Fang is a good skill, but useless for our purposes since we aren't shooting that much.

**Techniques: Things to use to increase your efficiency in combat**

*Stripping your shield: This is useful when playing with (for example) a Hide of Terramorphus. This shield doesn't stay down for ages like the Love Thumper does, but you need it's damage boost to deal with badasses. The answer is easy: Throw a Shock grenade with 0.0 Fuse at your feet and your shield should be gone, therefore giving you the Roid damage bonus.

The intro had the music ""The Heavy - Short Change Hero"" playing, and there was no way for me to obtain a copy of the intro without it...

* Tiny Tina Torgue is too much of a coincidence.

However, because I entered the speedway without entering through the gate, even though I was piddling around on foot, when I hit the end of the bridge my timer still would have been at 00:00 ... so, completion!

(Petty complaint),DomenicoChavez,240,68,98,http://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1cawkv/sometimes_vault_hunters_can_be_real_assholes/,"I was trying UVHM for the first time today (I know, it took me a real long time), and I realized that I just couldn't solo it, because I'm not that good of a player.

Anyway, since none of my PS3 friends own Borderlands, I've always played solo, and I actually love it, but I thought I'd give multiplayer a shot. I make my session public and in a couple of minutes 3 random vault hunters join in. 

We run to the first group of enemies and I'm having a really really hard time staying alive, because I never found the time to farm hours upon hours for good weapons, but I'm doing my best not to suck and hold the group back.

After we FINALLY defeat the group, one fo the vault hunters come up to me and set a trade; he's offering me a Conference Call. I think ""Awesome"", and figure out maybe he's got a bunch of them and he's offering me one to help me get by and make the group experience much better.
 I offer 4 of my best purple weapons (because I don't have any oranges) and the trade countdown begins. When it's at 1, the guy cancels the trade, leaving me confused. He then proceed to add 3 more legendaries, and starts the trade. Once again, when it's at 1, he cancels, and then he changes the 4 legendaries for another 4 legendaries.

This goes on another 2 times, because I don't know if this is normal or what to think. Finally, I realize he's just trying to show off his cool toys to remind me that everything I own sucks.
He gets out of the trade screen, throws an acid grenade at me and kills me. When I'm in FFYL, he logs out.

Dissapointed and kind of angry, I log out too, thinking that maybe I was better off soloing the game, 'cause some people can be real assholes...

Guess that's what I get for not farming the bosses hours upon hours and just trying to have some fun.

The patch seems to have fixed ""Keep it Piping Hot"".  Previously, it was bugged and had no effect if you had any sort of cooldown reduction active.

Now, however, it pairs *PERFECTLY* with ""Get Some"".  As soon as you trigger ""Get Some"" and begin reducing the Gunzerking cooldown, ""Keep It Piping Hot"" now activates, so if you invest a full 5/5 points into it, Sal can maintain a near-permanent +25% buff to gun damage, and +25% buff to grenade damage.  *Even while Gunzerking!*

Now, this only works while you have the ""Get Some"" buff active, but if you've ever used it you know that as long as you have rounds going downrange, ""Get Some"" is active.

**TL;DR: ECHOs auto play after long enough of sitting around**

So I just got the Mechromancer and I was doing a playthrough with her (she's badASS btw), and I got to the mission Assassinate the assassins. When I got to Assassin Oney, I deployed DT and he proceeded to kill Oney up on the unreachable ledge, making the ECHO recorder impossible to reach. I looked everywhere for a way to get up to there, and just as I was about to quit, the ECHO played itself. It was going to be impossible for me to complete this mission, but since Gearbox has awesome foresight, I was able to carry on. Thanks, Gearbox.

Start UVHM (or reset if you're already playing it) and do Hammerlock's first two quests. (Clear the camp and then kill the bullymongs) Reset UVHM and do it again. Rinse and repeat for really easy and fast experience. I want from 58 to 61 tonight in less than two hours, got a bunch of eridium (it seems to spawn more at the start of UVHM) and even got a few decent items.

I think GBX designed those first quests to give out more exp than others to help level the players fast at the start of the game in order to obtain their action skill, and for whatever reason, they haven't stopped that higher exp from applying to subsequent playthroughs. Then they added the ability to reset UVHM and all of a sudden you have a really easy way to repeat an easy and quick quest with over double the usual XP you'd get. I'm pretty sure it's an oversight.

 * The first enemy they started work on was the Stalker, because they didn't include a model or animations when they first put it in the game. It was always invisible.  
  
 * The last character they finished before shipping the game was Zer0, because they weren't sure of his play style. The lunging melee attacks were worrying Pitchford, thinking it would cause all sorts of collision problems but his staff ignored him and put them in anyway.  
  
 * **The third DLC may come before the end of the year. Pitchford ""wouldn't be surprised"" if it did.**  
  
 * Randy used to be a magician, and performs 2 little card tricks at about 7:45 in the video.  
  
 * Randy also won XPlay's ""The XPlay Challenge"", where he speedran World 1-1 of the original Super Mario Bros. in 21.1 seconds.  
  
**EDIT**: I didn't think these were particularly important but I'll post them here anyway. Thanks to Ph0x:  
  
 * They track the progress of players playing borderlands 2, and while 80% of them are still active, only 16.75% have reached the level cap (I think these are Xbox numbers only)

1369699967.0,160,self.Borderlands,1f6281,Let's talk Threequels,Draithian,204,44,233,http://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1f6281/lets_talk_threequels/,"I'm actually interested to know the general consensus in the community, on whether or not there should be a Borderlands 3, so, if everyone could, in their comments, just indicate yes or no, that would be cool.


My general opinion is yes; there could be a Borderlands 3 that is a fun, engaging, and fresh game. I also think there are several key things that need to be included in this third installment for it to match up to the first two, let alone exceed it:

* Anthony Burch
* Unique dialogue sequences for each of the vault hunters
* Better accommodations for those who enjoy hoarding and collecting weapons
* A small overhaul of the gun generation system


Anthony Burch is an amazing writer, and I think there was a near unanimous approval of where he took the game story wise and character wise. Anything less than that would be disappointing for many people.


A unscratchable itch for lots of people is the indifference of the NPCs concerning who you play as. I was hoping Lilith would freak out when she saw another siren, but nope, I get the same exact reaction as when she met my zer0. And why is no one terrified of Krieg, who to the casual observer is just as deranged and psychotic as all of the other psychos. This could have been a good way to make other character playthroughs even more game changing and refreshing and I think Gearbox missed out.


33 inventory spaces is clearly not enough space to hold a bazillion guns, and lots of us were and still are quite frustrated with having to use mules, or just ignore loot (for the lazier ones). Understandably so, the Gearbox wanted to improve the UI from the previous game, as well as stress the ""constant"" progression of loot and of finding better things. Once guns stop becoming obsolete as the player gains levels however, these design decisions become impediments to late game enjoyment. Obviously there is no simple solution to this, but perhaps a secondary bank such as a library that would look more like the inventory of the first game, which a player could pay a fee to store and withdraw guns from.


Finally, I have to admit I am ever so slightly disappointed with the gun generation in the second game. I think mechanics and characteristics that were overly gimmicky were shoehorned into place, and an unfortunate side effect was that certain weapons for some brands became incredibly impractical or unusable, and guns became a little monotonous. For example, every SMG felt the same as all the others from that manufacturer, and I ended up with only 5 SMGs to choose from.

These are the things that were just not at all good for me:

* Bandit pistols, ARs, SMGs, Shotguns.
* Hyperion sniper rifles, pistols.
* Dahl sniper rifles.
* Tediore shotguns.
* Maliwan pistols.
* Any AR with a Torgue barrel.
* ARs in general, really gearbox they sucked.

5 of 7 manufacturers had at least one weapon type that did not work (with the exception of some uniques) with their brand characteristics. I think there are a few ways of improving the gun diversity. For starters, bring back different materials, but this time have 2 or 3 different materials for each rarity level. Its little things like this that make for unique game play. More variation of stats would be nice, and please for the love of god Gearbox, let every manufacturer produce every weapon type! Even if you do get some that just don't work, or don't make sense, that adds to the diverse feel of the game! A Dahl shotgun for example, or a Torgue sniper rifle, offer fresh combinations of weapon and characteristics. There may be more duds, but with them there will be more things to enjoy and experiment with.


**TL;DR:** We need good writing, NPCs with working eyes, a bazillion inventory slots, and MOAR guns for there to be a good BL3.


**EDIT:** There are a few ideas brought up that I missed entirely or did not include, I'll list them here.


* Reactive dialogue, as in it knows your class, and when there's more than one player.
* Fully fleshed out vehicle options/customization.
* More RPG elements, possibly even MMORPG elements.
* An even larger more intensive overhaul of the gun system.",,False,self,t5_2r8cd,1369767281.0,,krieg2,True,t3_1f6281,http://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1f6281/lets_talk_threequels/,

I'd say the vast majority of 360 players I encounter don't use voice chat (not sure if PS3 players are any different) and it gets quite difficult to coordinate with other players when the only form of contact you can make with them is trying to interpret their pattern of jumping into actually saying something intelligible. 

My suggestion would be a sort of radial voice chat menu such as that used in games like Left 4 Dead 1/2 or Battlefield 2 (in subsequent Battlefield games, the menu seems to have been removed)

Stuff that should be included in the menu:

 * Look at this gun! (Or a ""look"" that uses context of what you're aiming at like L4D)
 * Help me!
 * Use your ability!
 * Look out, badass!
 * Follow me.
 * You take point.
 * Wait a moment.
 * Hurry up!
 * Yes/No

This menu would also be a good opportunity to hear the Vault Hunters talk a little bit more in the awesome dialogue writing that we've all come to expect from Gearbox.

Next Tuesday we have Gears coming out, and Bioshock Infinite the week after that. So today makes the most sense for adding a level cap.

How best to get the attention of vault hunters everywhere? First, what two things do these gamers love most of all? Loot and breaking the game...to get more loot.

So several hours before the level cap release, create a ""glitch"", an apparent gamebreaker that sprays players with delicious golden showers of wonderful orange loot.

Don't analyze that last sentence too much. 

And don't announce the glitch publicly. If the loot is seen as a gift, it will be seen as deserved, and less valuable...stolen loot is so much sweeter. If the loot seems to be the result of a mistake, the news will be a word-of-mouth wildfire, gamers rushing to capitalize on the gushing geysers of gunny goodness.

Then, after the fun faucet has been switched off, release the level cap. People will swarm back to the game, eager to try out their new weapons, as the level increases silently drag the new guns down into level 50 irrelevance.

Gamers are happy about their ill-gotten loot, and Gearbox gets people playing Borderlands again. Everyone wins.

So I rearranged the file, and made it nicer:

		Moxxi               Jack destroyed my underdome when he thought I was cheating on him, and now he wants to build his own arena just to rub it in my face. We're not gonna let that happen, sugar. Get out to Opportunity and kill the construction foreman who's running the project.
		Moxxi               Ooh -- he dropped a  key. Do a lady a favor and grab it.
		Moxxi               Every key fits in a lock, sugar -- check the containers, see if that key opens one of 'em.
		Jack                Ol' balloon-tits is still holdin' a grudge against me, huh? Don't get me wrong, I understand it -- once you've eaten prime rib for free, it's hard to go back to suckin' down hamburgers for cash. If you know what I'm talking about.
		Jack                I'm talkin' about dicks.
		Moxxi               Sounds like that key was just the right size. See if there's anything useful in there.
		Moxxi               If I know my explosives -- and I'd like to think I do -- you could use those charges to flood the construction site. If you'd blow up the nearby retaining wall and flood those pits, I'd be awful grateful.
		Jack                My construction site! Moxxi, you BITCH!
		Moxxi               Ha! Haven't heard Jack that angry since I kicked his plastic surgeried-ass to the curb. Come on back, sugar.
		Moxxi               Nothin' like a little vengeance to round out the day.
		Moxxi               Get away from the explosives, sugar -- they're gonna make a big boom.
		Moxxi               There's the foreman -- drop him for me, will ya?

I also sorted it by character, such as:

		This is Deputy Winger. Please don't be caught outside after hours – The Sheriff's just looking for excuses!  &lt;DepWinger - Lynchwood - Speaker&gt;
		Deputy Winger reminding you that you could always run. The Sheriff won't follow you outta Lynchwood, and I certainly won't. Please – just leave! Save yourself!  &lt;DepWinger - Lynchwood - Speaker&gt;
		The Sheriff has asked me, Deputy Winger, to remind you all of the individual punishments for breaking her two hundred and eighty-three laws. I'd read the whole list, but I'm just gonna go ahead and save us all some time: death. The punishment for everything is death. So please, keep your head down, and be cool.  &lt;DepWinger - Lynchwood - Speaker&gt;
		The Sheriff will be conducting a sweep of the city sometime in the next few weeks. And, no – I don't know what her real name is. All I know's she deputized me at gunpoint, she scares the crap outta me, and I really hope she's not listenin' to this.  &lt;DepWinger - Lynchwood - Speaker&gt;
		Dammit, everybody, stop raiding the mines! Eridium is Hyperion's number one priority, so if you attack the miners or steal their equipment, the Sheriff WILL come down on you! Don't give her a reason!  &lt;DepWinger - Lynchwood - Speaker&gt;
		Deputy Winger again. If you know anyone with information regarding the whereabouts of a Vault Hunter, please – tell them to come in of their own volition! Otherwise, the Sheriff will torture the information out of them. I'm trying to help you here, people!  &lt;DepWinger - Lynchwood - Speaker&gt;

However, the order of the lines are not always correct, due to how Gearbox has formatted the file.
For example, in Episode 16, Jack says that he can stab Lilith over and over again and Mordercai replies we are coming, hold out. In the text file, however, it's separated. So it's a reference to what is actually said, and not the order it's said in.

So, enjoy:

1351924275.0,159,self.Borderlands,12k0es,Borderlands freezing for small percentage of people who purchased the game.  Help bring this to mainstream attention. ,sknity,234,75,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/12k0es/borderlands_freezing_for_small_percentage_of/,"Hello, hopefully people who read this know a little bit about what is going on if not let me explain.  Since the launch day of Borderlands 2, there has been a glitch where the game freezes frequently and randomly only affecting about 5% of  the people who bought the game.  Some of these people have been able to get though the game and play it to completion.  Others like myself, have not been as lucky. I purchased the game at launch and I am stuck at level 12 because of this glitch.

What happens is the game will freeze often after an auto save, or a fast travel, but it has been proven that this would happen at all other random times during playing.  The freeze locks up the console (xbox in my case) where nothing works not even the home button, or ejecting the disc, its a hard freeze that looks like it might be damaging to the system itself.  The glitch happens if you are online, offline, playing on another xbox with a recovered account.  There was a flash drive work around for this problem, that worked for some but seems to not work anymore due to recent patches.  Gearbox has been pretty quiet on this subject, and when enough of a fuss was made on their forums they released a patch.  

Now this patch they released has made the freezing more constant and worse.  Players like myself can no longer get past the 2k screen when the game is loading.  Where this post comes in is; what can we the people affected by this glitch do?  Asking Gearbox about it has brought back nothing but silence, and the retailers we purchased the game from will not return the game because nothing on their end is ""wrong.""

If there isn't anything we can do, is it possible though people like yourselves that we can promote this glitch so it can get main stream media coverage? (ign, kotaku, etc) 

On the Gearbox forums there is a thread that is (at time of posting) 175 pages thick with complaints about this, with very minimal response.  
http://forums.gearboxsoftware.com/showthread.php?t=150907&amp;page=174

I just come to you guys asking for help to spread the word about what is going on with this, if there isn't anything we can do so be it, but at least let others know about the lack of attention this has gotten from Gearbox who released the game over 2 months ago and have yet to attend to this problem.  Thank you.

**TL;DR. Game keeps freezing, gearbox has been silent on issue, help spread the word to others about the issue so it might get fixed.**


edit - to clarify some of the solutions myself and others have tried. got a new copy of the game, Installing the game, clearing the cache, different games on the same Xbox(i finished dishorned and RE6 with no problems). I would try starting over but i cannot even make it past the 2k screen.

1372519280.0,159,self.Borderlands,1hba5y,[x-post /r/borderlands2] For those interested in the Rock Golems...,Chrispy52x2006,191,32,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1hba5y/xpost_rborderlands2_for_those_interested_in_the/,"I was fascinated with the Rock Golems and liked watching them attack other enemies and leveling up. I kept track of one and decided to share it for you all.

----

The one I found, started at level 60; with each kill it gets, it levels up. 

**Rock Golem** (60) --&gt; remove Core, it becomes --&gt; 

**Unbound Golem** (61) --&gt; it gets 1 kill, it becomes --&gt;

**Reckless Golem** (62-63) --&gt; it gets 2 kills, it becomes --&gt;

**Nasty Golem** (64-67) --&gt; it gets 4 kills, it becomes --&gt; 

**Imposing Rock Golem** (68-71) --&gt; it gets 4 kills, it becomes --&gt;

**Rock GOD** (72)

----

It's just like the Goliaths in that it just takes kills to get it to the final form. Unlike the Goliaths though, each kill does increase its level by one (I think the Goliaths skip levels with each name change). I would imagine you have a better chance of getting better loot, but I didn't get anything ""wow"" (bunch of money, bunch of eridium, a green, and a purple). 

They are quite difficult to take down as the Rock GOD. I dropped my dual nuke turrets 3 times and nearly put 1000 rounds of my Slagga with a bee shield (with nearly all rounds getting the bonus damage) into him before he went down. They are non-slag-able though.

I checked around and found that this information wasn't really anywhere yet. Orcz.com only has up to Reckless and doesn't say anything about how to evolve them. So I hope this is useful for people.

----

EDIT: Couple things I thought of to also add. 

**[1]** Once they are at Rock GOD, they will not level up again (I.E. once it reached level 72, I allowed it to kill another enemy and it did NOT go to level 73). 

**[2]** ~~I don't know what happens if you allow a plain Rock Golem to kill an enemy. This wouldn't take much work to find out and I'll edit when I get around to finding out.~~ If a Rock Golem kills an enemy, it does NOT level up nor evolve in any sort of way. 

**[3]** I would be willing to bet that if there were a minimum of 4 other enemies attacking it, a Rock Golem would be killed without it evolving.

**[4]** I don't know anything about the experience gained from killing any of the levels (considering I'm level 61). If I had to guess, I would think it's like the Goliaths in that the killed enemies XP is tripled and added to the Golem.

----

EDIT 2:

**[1]** I did some testing on the Rock Golem near the entrance to Flame Rock (in Unassuming Docks) to figure out this 72/73 thing. When I got all the information above, the initial Rock Golem was level 60. Upon destroying the Core, it went to level 61. It then increased one level with each kill after that. Upon reaching 72 (and evolving to Rock GOD) it stopped leveling up. I let it kill 1 more enemy at that point; a skeleton (I don't recall which type). Neither time did it level up again. Please note, I **did NOT** say that higher levels weren't possible. I just said once it reaches Rock God, it doesn't level anymore. 

Now, when I just tested it twice, both times the starting Rock Golem was level 61. When I destroyed the core, it did become a Unbound Rock Golem but it did not level up. For the second try I also got him the Rock GOD at level 71 (there was one time he killed two enemies at once so that might have had something to do with it.) But he killed me before I could try and get him to kill some more and when i revived he was cone but was replaced by a new 61 Rock Golem. Upon core destruction on this one, he did not level up.

**[2]** Just got that last Golem to Rock God at level 71. I then let it kill 4 more enemies and it **DID NOT LEVEL AGAIN**.

----

EDIT 3:

**[1]** It would appear that the core destruction doesn't level up the Golem if he is already at 61. Also, every time he's started at 61, he Rock GOD'd by level 71 (needing only 3 kills as Imposing Golem; all the other levels and evolved names match with my original chart).

**[2]** It's too bad that in Masterkizz's video we didn't see any of the lead up to Iron GOD. For starters, I'd like to know what level it started. Based on the new finding that the Core doesn't always lead to a level up, it's possible that he was level 62. We do see many 62 skeletons; the Iron Golem is probably basely more powerful so a higher level makes sense; and he's also further into the DLC, location-wise, so a higher level enemy would make sense.

(spoiler warning!),lendrick,180,25,434,http://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1056ur/borderlands_2_tips_thread_post_handy_things_youve/,"Here are some of mine.  I'm only level 13, which clearly isn't as far as a lot of people have gotten, but for people just getting started:

(I've marked spoilers, but they're really not all that spoiler-y.)

* Do the sidequests.  The gear you get from them tends to be really awesome.  Specifically, [the gun you get from the doctor and the shield you get from Maya are amazing.](/spoiler ""quest loot"")
* [When you're doing the cult quest, there's a boss called Scorch.  If you have a rocket launcher (level 12+, I believe) he's pretty easy to kill.  He's also pretty easy to get to and he drops nice stuff, so he's good farming fodder.  He's there every time you restart, even after you've done the quest (this seems to hold true with a lot of bosses).](/spoiler ""minor cult quest"")
* Tediore rocket launchers are awesome, particularly ones that don't hold very many rockets.  When you reload them, they act as a (less accurate) rocket.  If your launcher only holds 2 rockets, that's essentially 50% more ammo.
* [When you go to rescue Roland, make sure to take caustic weapons (I didn't, and it was painful).  Also, save your rockets for the final boss of that quest.  You'll need them.](/spoiler ""minor quest"")
* Explosive ammo goes right through the huge metal shields those big dudes carry.
* The lockers and stuff in Sanctuary seem to hold better than average stuff (Eridium comes up frequently, for instance).  I check them without fail whenever I start the game.
* The default game settings allow you to drop in on your Steam friends at any time, without them even having to approve you.  I did it while a friend of mine was AFK, and he was like, 'how did you get in here?'. :)
* By the travel point in the area outside the sanctuary, there's a set of those monsters that throw things at you.  Lead one over near the travel point.  Continuously shoot their projectiles out of the sky, then buy more ammo when you run out.  It's a very easy way to get all the way up to rank 5 on that challenge in a few minutes, which nets you over 150 points (I think).

1352327827.0,155,self.Borderlands,12tn5b,garofalo's Awesome Guide to Extracting Audio from Borderlands 2 (plus some goodies),garofalo,185,30,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/12tn5b/garofalos_awesome_guide_to_extracting_audio_from/,"**PART UN**

The Borderlands 2 files are located (if you bought it on Steam) in

    steam\steamapps\common\Borderlands 2\WillowGame\CookedPCConsole

If you didn't buy it on steam, look for the Borderlands 2 folder in Program Files or Program Files (x86).

The files you're looking for are:

    Audio_Streaming.pck
    Audio_Banks.pck
    English(US)\Audio_Streaming.pck
    English(US)\Audio_Banks.pck

Everything I pull comes out of English Audio Streaming, but I know there are other assets in the other three. There are also plenty of assets in *CookedPCConsole* (lots of music and sound effects), so if you want to peruse those you should be able to follow these instructions to do so.

**Download the [extractor](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/6241970/extractor.zip), [ww2ogg](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/6241970/ww2ogg019.zip), and [revorb](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/6241970/revorb.exe).**

Create a folder somewhere called BL2Audio. Copy the .zip files and the .pck files listed above to it and extract the .zips (they'll create folders). Rename the two English(US) .pck files to ""English_Audio_Streaming"" and ""English_Audio_Banks"", then create folders for each of the .pck files using their names. In the extractor folder (*BL2Audio\extr25*), open Extractor.exe. Select English_Audio_Banks.pck (it's the smallest, so it's a good one to test on) to scan and select *BL2Audio\English_Audio_Banks* as your extraction location. Click Start.

The extractor will scan and show you a window with a bunch of files. Click the small + at the bottom left and click Ok when the mask dialog comes up with *.* as the default. That should select all the files the extractor found. Click Ok again and click Extract. Verify your output folder and click Ok. That should extract all the .wav files to the specified folder. However, you won't be able to play them yet.

**EDIT: semi_modular_mind [found an easier way to do this next part](http://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/12tn5b/garofalos_awesome_guide_to_extracting_audio_from/c6ybw3s). After the extraction, use [BL2Soundtools](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/6241970/BL2Soundtools.rar) (rehosted because the forum link is to a long-wait filelocker) to convert, revorb, and rename the files. I'm testing it now, and will update when I find out whether this works excellently or just well.**

**EDIT 2: Well, it works really well. Extract the files and run BL2Soundtools to convert each of the 4 folders. Don't bother trying to rename Audio_Banks or Audio_Streaming; they both make the tool crash. But it runs *great* on English_Audio_Streaming. After you rename, search the main folder for the non-bracketed name of whatever you find in the .int file subtitle-wise. Many thanks to the folks over at the Gearbox fora, and kudos to semi_modular_mind for finding this.**

Now here's the annoying part. Because of how the files are connected, you need to make a copy of the *English_Audio_Banks* folder and rename the .wav files to .txt. That allows windows to index them so you can search the strings we'll talk about shortly. To rename them, I recommend [ReNamer](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/6241970/renamer.zip).

Now that you have one folder of .txt files and one of .wav, copy ww2ogg.exe, packed_codebooks_aoTuV_603.bin (from the *ww2ogg019* folder you extracted earlier), and revorb.exe into *English_Audio_Streaming* (the one with the .wav files). Open Command Prompt, navigate to the folder, and run the following command (copy it, right click in Command Prompt, and select Paste):

    FOR /F ""tokens=*"" %G IN ('DIR /B *.wav') DO ww2ogg.exe ""%G"" --pcb packed_codebooks_aoTuV_603.bin

That will give you .ogg files for every .wav file. Don't worry about the truncation error. Still won't be able to play the files, though. You have to revorb them. Or apply revorb. I don't know the terminology, but run this command in the window you hopefully didn't close:

    for /r %f in (*.ogg) do @revorb ""%f""

Now you should have a folder full of .ogg files that you can play with VLC or WinAmp or whatever player you use. You can enter ""wav"" into the search box and delete all the .wav files now.

Repeat this with all the .pck files you want to extract from. I recommend prefixing the extracted files (ReNamer can do this too) with the .pck name (e.g. ""English_Audio_Streaming"" or ""Audio_Banks"") and placing all the .txt files into the same folder - I call mine ""All TXT Files"" (brilliant convention, I know, but you'll see why this works later) - and all the .ogg files into the appropriate folders you created earlier, named after the .pck file they came from.

**PART DEUX**

If you navigate to *Borderlands 2\WillowGame\Localization\INT* you'll find a bunch of .int files. (There are other localization folders for other languages, but INT has the English ones and I speak English.) Ake_VO_Episode_01.int, for example, is the subtitles for all of Chapter 1. Marcus's intro line, ""So, you want to hear another story, eh? One where the very fate of Pandora hangs in the balance? If not, too bad -- I'm telling you anyway."", is the first subtitle of the chapter.

The bracketed name, ""[vo_ep1_pt1_01_live_marcus]"", is - surprise, surprise - also encoded into the wav file of Marcus's voice. That way the subtitles can display at the same time as the file is playing out of the compressed .pck file. Copy the name, with or without the brackets, and use Windows search in the folder of .txt files you created earlier.

The VO Episode assets are all (for me) in *English_Audio_Streaming*. Of course, that file is huge. (It has 14,702 files after extraction. The other massive one is Audio_Banks.pck, with 18,568 files after extraction.)

Anyway, search the folder of .txt files for the name and the first result should be something like ""English_Audio_Streaming 13325.wav.txt"". Go to the English_Streaming folder of .ogg files, find 13325.ogg, open it in your favorite media player, and voila. You hear Marcus's husky baritone introducing the new and ""improved"" Pandora.

**PART TROIS**

I don't know how to locate specific music or sound effect assets. Which sucks, because I'd love, for example, the non-subtitled rantings of the Pinocchio Loader. If anybody else comes up with a way, I'd love to hear it.

**EDIT 3: Found the Pinocchio Loader lines. They were subtitled. They start with ""vosq_boy"". Sweet.**

**PART QUATRE**

You've all been waiting for this. Here's my list of requested voiceover files (in a comment because of text post character limits). Links lead to my public Dropbox folder. Randy Pitchford (Gearbox President) hasn't replied to my tweet asking if this was okay, and the mod Daemmerung [commented](http://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/12qi72/oh_my_god_shut_up_dave/c6xkxch) that there's a fair-use argument for a few single soundbites, but not for extraction/distribution *en masse*. Therefore, only thirty or so (I think that's a reasonable interpretation of ""few"" given that the number of subtitled sound assets is nearly 7,000) of the files in the comment below are active links.

First off, I do not intend any of this to be libel towards this great game. I honor and value this wondrous masterpiece as highly as the rest of you. But even I take out this disc/click on something else every now and then. Hell, I went back to ""Rayman Origins.""

Every game has a replay value; some have higher values than others. But in the end, that value IS finite meaning it'll only be so much fun for only so long. If you have thoroughly beaten the game, including DLC, as I mentioned at the start, well of course you're going to get bored. It's alright; there is no crime. Sure, future DLC will come and add to the replay value but you can only kill the same raid bosses for so long before it feels like a chore.

Also I think crafting totally takes the spirit out of the randomly generated loot system that keeps you going back and farming that same boss for that perfect drop.  It'd really kill replayability as you could easily whip together the uber-gun you wanted and then basically have nothing left to strive for.

 In the first game the cap wasn't raised until the third DLC. From memory that was about 2 years after release. This is one month after release. There are a large number of people who either havent finished the game yet, or like myself got corrupted save files and had to start again. It makes no sense to raise the cap when so many people aren't there in the first place.

Secondly, whether from here or the gearbox forums it's quite apparent how many people do like grinding/farming legendary weapons. A level increase now effectively makes those obsolete. Even if you are a 50 and have spent hours grinding whichever boss for the drop, raising the cap for the sake of it ruins this and means everyone has to get to level 55 and start again. 

Next DLC is intended to add content, however unless you are some sort of demigod I'm willing to guess there are characters you haven't played fully. With the original game, Gaige and this DLC there's so much content there for you. Why not save the cap increase for when there's less for people to complete. 

And probably my favorite thing is that having less skill points make you use them wisely! Getting enough skill points now so you can get that second game changer just seems kind of over the top and would take away some of the diversity of the play styles. Yes it's probably going to happen in the future, but it's not needed now.

Its been a long time since taking on a mob has felt really worth something. Its great to feel like a little bit of strategy has been brought back. I learned this during the bad hair day mission when you have to melee the bullymongs. The health regen went up as fast as my melee brought it down so I had to figure out different weapon combos that would allow me to get them low enough to finish off. It added new fun to a mission that is generally pretty monotonous in later playthroughs. I've never really used slag but it has been fun to mess around with the new multipliers as well.

1349642616.0,152,self.Borderlands,113pip,PSA: I think I'm the luckiest guy posts...,vexstream,201,49,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/113pip/psa_i_think_im_the_luckiest_guy_posts/,"Over the past week, we've been seeing a lot of triple-vault slot machines, and after a quick bit of testing, I was able to do this: 
http://imgur.com/a/XCpMo
Yeah. Four double slots, all in a row. 

This is incredibly easily accomplished, using cheat engine, and I just thought I'd give everyone a heads up that all those posts might be faked.

Also, if you want to know more about the script I'm using, PM me.

Edit: since I keep getting PMs about how it works, and how to use it, here goes: 


The bl2 slot machines use a random number generator that makes a variable between 1 and somereallybignumber. It then compares that to a table of ranges, and if it is in a particular range, it pops the reward attached to that range.
All this is doing is making the random generator only output a certain value.
Full table here: 

0 - 6711 = White Weapon X-X-Head

6712 - 11745 = Green Weapon 3 x Cherries

11746 - 12249 = Blue Weapon 3 x Legs

12250 - 12299 = Purple/Pink Weapon 3 x Marcus

12300 - 12305 = Orange Weapon 3 x Vault (Jackpot)

12306 - 13143 = 3 x Eridium

13144 - 13395 = 3 x Double Eridium

13396 - 13470 = 3 x Triple Eridium (Jackpot)

13471 - 21860 = Money (Random amount)

21861 - 24377 = Boom 3 x Head

26056 - 32767 = Nothing

32768 - XXXXX = Break (Reload area to fix)

You use this by downloading cheat engine (cheatengine.org)(yes, the big virus-looking button) and install.

Then, take that script and paste it into a new .txt, take the txt, rename it ""borderlands2.ct"" (no quotes) Save it to my documents/my cheat tables

Then, boot up cheat engine, boot up borderlands. Alt tab to cheat engine, click the glowy process button, select borderlands.

If done correctly, it should say ""load the default table?"" or some similar text.
If not, hit the load button (next to process button) and load the script manually.

Then, hit the little checkbox in the bottom box, all three of them.

And finally, go play slots


Anyway, there you have it.


Edit2: TIL everyone is really interested in getting this script. Getting a pm every other minute. So, in order to save my fingers, here's a direct link to the script.

It includes:  

* Golden Key 
* Gearbox gun pack
* Vault hunter relic
* Gaige/Mechromancer class

**NOTE 2.0:** **Check if you're number has been taken before posting, just press ctrl+f** and look, it saves me having to check for you! I wouldn't want to randomise it and find that ~~two people can't win  because they have the same number.~~ (whoever posted the number first would win)

Just don't expect me post on the dot after the cut off, I'll need time to sort the numbers as well as organise the winner getting their code especially if they are in a different time zone.

I've compiled a short list of current issues that I have with Eridium, from my perspective as a player. I'd love to discuss possible solutions with you, and generally raise support towards bringing this matter to a higher level of attention :)
    
**User Interface:**

* As you've probably noticed, **Eridium is the same color as epic-quality loot**. This adds up to quite a bit of lost time to those of you who repeatedly farm bosses that happen to drop large piles of loot.
 * An easy solution from a development viewpoint would be to simply **change Eridium to a slighly different shade of purple**. It would not require any changes to the actual item models, and will allow players to distinguish more easily between Eridium and epic-quality loot. It may be confusing at first, but after a while it'll be just like telling apart ammunition and common-quality loot.
* **Eridium is a currency, like money, and as such it should be collected automatically when walked over**. This is another huge QoL buff for the above-mentioned group of players, and there are no negative implications  to it that I can think of.
* **A player can only hold a maximum of 99 Eridium at a time.** This one may not be as important at the moment, simply because there aren't many uses for it. Which leads me to the next section!

**Gameplay:**

* As of now, **there isn't any real use for Eridium at the later parts of the game**. It's used mainly throughout Playthrough 1 to purchase ammunition and storage upgrades, and usually you're capped out before you hit level 35. It's also required for entering Terramorphous Peak, but the cost is a mere 4 pieces. Other than that, everyone is just sitting around with 99 Eridium in their inventory with no actual purpose.
 * I'm a bit hesitant about solutions to this one, as most of them require the addition of new content, which, while isn't bad, might be less attractive to the developers. That being said, here are some of them:
     * **Raise the value of Eridium** by either making everything more expensive, or making Eridium significantly rarer. I find myself frowning a bit at this solution because it seems somewhat lazy and doesn't really solve the underlying problem - at a certain point, you'd still cap out and have nothing to do with any future Eridium that you get. But I'm putting it on the table for good measures.
     * **Invent new uses for Eridium**. This one was covered quite a bit by the folks over here in previous Eridium-related discussions, so I'll just mention a few that I happen to remember: Eridium-imbued gear, Eridium-based slot machines, Eridium-based vending machines, more content that requires Eridium to access... This list goes on and on, and has some suggestions that I personally really like.

I'd like to thank you if you stuck with me thus far, it was enjoyable writing out my thoughts and I hope they provoke some discussion! Apologies for my English, it's my second language.

2. When you sell something, the game says 'are you sure?' I like having this second level of security so i dont sell my best loot (i've accidentally sold my infinity, kerblaster, torgue shotgun and many more because of this)
3. Enemies move much less erratically in the second game.
4. I had a 31 round clip on my shotgun. What happened to massive shotgun magazines?
5. I had a masher :(  
6. I wasn't using any legendaries, because most purple guns were notably better. I cannot say the same for BL2
7. The menu is much more concise in the first game, it only displays text and doesn't fuck about when I use both my mouse and scroll wheel. (this is the most noticeable change IMO)
8. My scorpio turret didn't have a very long duration, but it killed notably more enemies than my scorpio 2.0 would have.

Click it and fill it out while you farm, no more need for individual submissions / boss forms. PLEASE NOTE that I only want ACCURATE and CURRENT data. Unless you KNOW for a fact how many runs you have done, do NOT submit. No guessing or estimating past runs. I already transfered the data from the old form, so do not submit those runs either. Please submit data as you farm and tally how many runs you have done so as not to skew results. I will update as results come in! The new form is at the top of this thread. 

* PLEASE NOTE for Warrior kills, do not submit your first (quest) kill, as the odds of a legendary are much higher. Only submit warrior data if you are actually FARMING him. 

* Also for Terra, don't count the class mod. Only say if he dropped one of his other legendaries, and say which it is

I looked online which resulted in a lot of combinations that summoned Flinter, but nothing about how the puzzle works. Eventually I just decided to figure it out for myself. I won't bore everyone with the tedious tests I performed, but I believe I have a solid explanation. I apologize if this has already been solved, but so far I have not found anything like this.  

**NOTE:** This DOES NOT reveal the sequence needed to summon Flinter, only the process used to determine how the devices interact with the lights to solve the puzzle. You'll still have to figure that out for yourself ;)

There's a lot of information here, so I've tried to break it down into different sections. I'm not sure if it flows well, but I hope it helps.  
*****
##Intro
*****
The puzzle is based on the use of binary bit-masking using the XOR gate. If you're not familiar with bit-masking or bitwise operations, you can read up on it [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation), but I'll be going over how to use an XOR gate later on. To begin with, we need think of the light as binary numbers instead of colors where:

* Red = 0 
* Green = 1

So when you first enter the room and all 5 lights are red, think of it as 00000. The actual binary number is irrelevant, we're just using the 5 digits to represent the colors for use in our XOR bit-masking operations.  

*****
##Devices &amp; Masks
*****

The room contains 4 devices: Valve, Lever, Switch and T.V. Each device has 2 5-digit binary masks associated with it. A mask is simply a predetermined binary number that is used to perform a bitwise operation with. Each time you activate a device, it alternates applying the two masks to the current state of the lights. 

Before going any further, I think it will help to see the mask table.

Device|Position|Mask  
:---|:--:|:---
Valve|1|11000
 |2|10101
T.V.|1|10110
 |2|10000
Switch|1|01101
 |2|00001
Lever|1|10100
 |2|00011

Initially, all devices are set to position 1. Activating the Valve, for example, would apply the mask '11000' and put the valve in position 2. Activating the Valve a second time would apply the mask '10101' and put the valve back in position 1. This rule applies even if other devices are activated in between. So if you activate the valve, switch and then the valve again, the valve will be back in position 1 and the switch in position 2.

**Note:** I read online that an activation sequence that works for one person may not work for another. This could mean that initial position might be random for each person. I've only been able to test this on my account, so if anyone would like to test this and report their results, I'd greatly appreciate it!

*****
##Bit Masking using the XOR gate (skip if you already know how)
*****
So what does this all mean? If you don't know how to do bit masking, then this might be a little confusing; however, here's gist of using an XOR(⊕) operation. Essentially, if you XOR a 0 &amp; 0 or 1 &amp; 1 the result is a 0, and if you XOR a 1 &amp; 0 or 0 &amp; 1, the result is a 1. 

A|B|X| |A|B|X
-|-|-|-|-|-|-
0|0|**0**| |R|R|**R**
0|1|**1**| |R|G|**G**
1|0|**1**| |G|R|**G**
1|1|**0**| |G|G|**R**

This is called a truth table, where A &amp; B are your inputs and X is the result. If it helps, you can just think of it as R and G instead of 0 and 1. To bitmask a 5-digit number, just write it out like you would a 5 digit math problem:

     Initial State: 11000  GGRRR
              Mask: 10101  GRGRG
                    -----  -----
            Result: 01101  RGGRG

I represented this as both binary and R/G. You can start with any column and simply apply the rule from top to bottom for that column. So to solve this, I'll go from left to right.

1. 1 ⊕ 1 = 0 | G ⊕ G = R 
2. 1 ⊕ 0 = 1 | G ⊕ R = G 
3. 0 ⊕ 1 = 1 | R ⊕ G = G 
4. 0 ⊕ 0 = 0 | R ⊕ R = R 
5. 0 ⊕ 1 = 1 | R ⊕ G = G

Since we went from left to right, transpose the results from top to bottom with the top result being the leftmost digit, so the result is 01101 or RGGRG.

*****
##Summoning Flinter
*****

As I said, when you first enter the room and all the lights are red, we should think of this current state as 00000 (RRRRR). By activating a device, you then apply the mask, associated to its position, to the current state of the lights. Let's use the valve again an example. 

Device|Position|Current State|Mask|Resulting State
:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
Valve|1|00000|11000|11000

Activating the valve again would then result in:

Device|Position|Current State|Mask|Resulting State
:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
Valve|1|00000|11000|11000
Valve|2|11000|10101|01101

Cycling through a single device 4 times will return it to the state in which you started from. 

Device|Position|Current State|Mask|Resulting State
:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
Valve|1|00000|11000|11000
Valve|2|11000|10101|01101
Valve|1|01101|11000|10101
Valve|2|10101|10101|00000

The same process can be applied to any of the devices then until you get a result of 11111 or GGGGG.

*****
##Conclusion
*****

I'm sure you're thinking by now, ""Wow...this is a little bit obsessive for just a small side mission."", and you're probably right. But I'm sure there's a lot of you out there who like to do this kind of thing because...well, because it's there! Though I personally think this was a lot of fun and very much enjoyed tackling this problem.

For anyone that's interested, I've also created a ""simulator"" in Excel 2007 that you can download [here](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B_uJZZ1yX4MCYkpfbE9jMTU4R1k/edit?usp=sharing). I had to make it a macro enabled workbook in order to do the XOR calculations, but I promise you there's no viruses. Enjoy :)

**[EDIT 1]** FYI - To use the simulator, just click in the leftmost column and choose the device you want to activate, the spreadsheet does the rest. To reset it or backup a step, just delete the value in the device column. I only added coding for a limited number of attempts, so if you can't solve it by the end...well, start over :) It doesn't take that many steps to solve.

**[EDIT 2]** First I just thought I'd clarify since it seems I'm getting a lot of responses about it, I do know the sequence (well a sequence) that summoned him, I just didn't post it so as not to spoil it for anyone. Second, although it started because I didn't know a set sequence before figuring this out, it really had nothing to do with wanting to get one. I just love to see puzzles like this and figure them out. Sure I could have looked it up, yes it would have been easier, but why? Where's the fun in that! :) I realize not everyone has that compulsion, but I guess I'm one of the few that does.  It's all about the trip, not the destination!

**[EDIT 3]** I think I understand the confusion.

I just took a look at the table and we got a *lot* of submissions yesterday! I'm hoping that I'll be able to update this around ~twice a month (placing the second update I've done around the beginning of March), so keep submitting like mad.

**Introduction**:

Hey fellow vault hunters! It's been a while since we've seen an update to the Crowd Sourcing Project, and so I asked /u/Mononoko if I could take the reigns. He was kind enough to let me do it, so here we are with an update! This information should be accurate as of **February 17th, 2013**. Some of the 18th's data may be included, as I had to reorganize the sheets for VHR/without VHR into something easier for me to work with. I'm also looking into making an automated system that we can use to constantly have up-to-date drop rates without any additional effort, so that will be CSP V4 most likely. So, if you're a web developer with some experience with databased, feel free to message me if you'd like to help.

You may notice that formatting may be a little different, mainly because I find having to keep track of all possible drops for bosses to be extremely difficult once you're dealing with the amount of 

submissions we have. Hopefully, V4 will also be able to track that as well, so bear with me until then.

Some notes:

* Don't submit your first (quest) kill for the Warrior. The odds of a Legendary drop are much, much higher. Please only submit data on the Warrior if you're farming him.

* For Terramorphous, do not include the Slayer of Terramorphous class mod. Only submit if he dropped one of his other Legendaries.

* If a boss drops multiple Legendaries, or drops one that isn't in their usual pool (I.E. the Warrior drops a Bee), you **do not** need to clarify which Legendary they dropped.

* You may include Seraph items in your runs if they were dropped by a Seraph Guardian.

* **Remember, solo runs only!** Do not include runs if you're using the player slider tool.

**FUN FACT TIME!**

* Did you know? Bone Head 2.0 *doesn't* drop a legendary item. However, a couple adventurous vault hunters still ran him a total of **410** times.

* According to one sly fellow, he ran Jesus a total of 42 times and resulting in the dropping of 3046 legendary items. That's a drop rate of **7,252 percent**! 

* The Borderlands wiki lists Doc Mercy's [drop rate](http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Doc_Mercy) for the Infinity being at 0.07%. However, if you average out the runs provided above, the average drop rate is 0.17%. We must be very lucky!

I'm not sure what his action would be, but looking at him, he has the following characteristics of a playable character:

1. An easily interchangeable head. I mean, look at it, you could give him many and varied hats, facial hair, and glasses, among other things.

2. A penchant to want to shoot things.  No other NPC (except the original four Vault Hunters) is actually much of a combatant. Tina blows stuff up, and both Moxxi and Scooter have been known to kill, but only Hammerlock seems to be someone who would do so on a regular basis as a hunter (despite the fact that he defers to you most of the time, because he is an NPC and that's how the game works)

3. His mechanical arm and leg could easily have translated into an action skill of sorts (though Gaige's didn't, which is sort of sad).

4. My big clue, just noticed after I met him for the first time as Krieg today. http://imgur.com/cz4mbiG Look at the two ""books"" on his pants. they look suspiciously like something that could easily become a class mod, don't you think? I don't see anything like this on any other NPC, either, making me really think Hammerlock was supposed to be the Hunter playable class.

**Artemis** as the Courier

Action Skill: **Fleetfoot**:  Grants a 100% movement speed boost and a 50% chance to dodge bullets for 30 seconds.
____
The Courier's shtick is his speed.  His abilities grant him speed bonuses to just about everything he does, from reloading his gun, to decreasing fuse time on grenades, to reviving his fellow Vault Hunters.  Depending on the tree you run down--that's a pun, you see--you can increase his survivability or decrease the amount of time it takes to kill somebody.

I've only got one tree so far, but take a look and tell me what you think: 

**Tree one: Run 'n Gun**

Swift Hands:  Increases reload speed (5 levels, up to 50%)

Steady As She Goes:  Increases movement speed while aiming (5 levels, up to 35%)

Swiftness: *Kill Skill.* Killing an enemy grants a bonus to movement speed and fire rate for a few seconds (5 levels, up to 35% movement speed, up to 50% fire rate)

Moving On:  Increases weapon swap speed while moving (5 levels, up to 75%)

Hard and Fast:  Increases melee damage (5 levels, up to 35%)

Never Slow Me Down:  Minor Gamechanger.  Firing a weapon and using melee attacks no longer interrupt your sprint.

From the Hip:  Increases hip fire accuracy (5 levels, up to 35%)

Ratatat-Tat:  Increases the fire rate of all automatic weapons while moving (5 levels, up to 50%)

Catch a Bullet:  While sprinting, you now have a 5% chance to ignore all damage from a bullet.  Said bullet is added to your ammunition.  Does not catch rockets.

Running Throw:  Sprinting increases the distance you can lob grenades (5 levels, up to 100%)

Defensive Line:  Major gamechanger.  *Melee Override.*  While Fleetfoot is active, running and pressing the melee button will perform a running tackle.  This attack does massive damage and knockback, and has a 20% chance to stun an enemy for 5 seconds.  If this attack is performed while your shield is depleted, it costs 5% of your current health, but the damage is increased even further.

----
So that's Artemis so far.  I know a few of the skills on the other trees, but not enough to give them their own huge sections like this one.  One of the trees will be focused on survivability, including the ability to regenerate health whilst sprinting.  The other tree is more along the lines of support--one skill will give him a movement boost if one of his allies are down, and another will cut the time it takes to revive a fallen ally in half.

So what do you guys think so far?  Too strong?  Need more info?  Complete crap?

1362604948.0,133,self.Borderlands,19ssub,A User-Friendliness Audit of Borderlands 2 (X-post from r/Borderlands2),arsefacey,153,20,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/19ssub/a_userfriendliness_audit_of_borderlands_2_xpost/,"**TL;DR: I'm a web UX strategist and I've got some ideas to address user-friendliness problems in this game, and/or the next in the series**

For starters: I love BL1 and 2. LOOOOVE them.  But there are aspects of the interface that are clunky, unintuitive, or just downright unfriendly, and a lot of them create very harsh or ""unforgiving"" feel to what's otherwise a light, fun game.  Many are easily fixed.  For example (using 360 controls for reference):


###Sorting/Dropping Hotkey

A big rule of any interface is to *not* change the purpose of a key between similar interfaces.  Some screens (Quest log) use Y; others (Inventory) use LT/RT.  From one screen to the next, Y means either ""harmlessly sort these things"" or ""potentially drop a valuable item off a cliff."" Losing a lvl 50 legendary to a giant hole because I got my screen-centric controls confused is a potentially heartbreaking mistake that the interface should make almost impossible. 

Using the triggers to scroll left/right through sorting mechanisms is a luxury not a need, and triggers are needed to scroll text on the quest log screen, so just use Y as the ""sort selector"" everywhere.  Use a trigger button or analog stick-click to drop an item from the inventory screen; as a potentially disastrous action, dropping an item SHOULD use a non-standard, non-face button — I should need to think for a millisecond.


###Skill Tree

Let me add/remove points with A and B until I like what I've got (just like the calcs on the Borderlands site), and simply add a Save/Confirm button at the end.  I shouldn't be out $10k in respec fees if I accidentally double tap the A button on the wrong skill.


###Inventory Scrolling

Don't auto-scroll the inventory list when I'm selling/transferring items. It's disorienting to see the selection jump down to the bottom, and makes users second-guess what they've got selected (or that they just sold the right thing).


###Using the Stash/Safe

The slots mean nothing and they have no inherent order, so why do we have to choose a bank slot to transfer to? This should be a single click action - I'm basically ""selling"" the item to my safe, so the same control model as vending machines should be used: I click to receive, or I click to send away.  I can keep clicking things to send them over until the receiving container is full, at which point, I see the usual ~~full~~ cursor.  


###SHIFT Codes

All on-screen console keyboards suck. Not your fault, but please understand and adapt the interface to make using them as painless as possible. SHIFT codes require home console users to keep hopping in and out of 5 separate text fields.  Make them one big field, and it'll feel a lot faster/easier (if you can, auto-enter hyphens every 5 digits to break the number up for easier reading/verification).


*The following two items are less about the interface and more about gameplay mechanics that I feel break from the ""kill stuff, get loot"" spirit of the game.*


###Lootsplosions (you kill a boss and loot explodes everywhere, e.g. The Warrior)

These are too random and uncontrolled.  I understand the visceral/entertainment value of a flying pile of loot, but seeing a purple item floating somewhere I can't reach due to level design or player movement mechanics is just broken (and downright mean). If there's a ton of white trash on the ground and the one purple that drops is sitting on a pillar that I can't climb, or floating in lava, I'm made to feel like killing the boss was a waste.  Whenever possible, use the chest/container/loot room approach for large scale looting (for regular mobs, dropping where they die is fine - part of the strategy is to *not* kill a dude on a roof if you want his drops).

If lootsplosions are considered too integral to the ""Borderlands Style,"" give us a means of summoning nearby loot in a set radius to my location (a mechanic commonly used in action games for health orbs, etc.). That way, I can ""attract' that purple down off the giant pillar, and actually use or sell it.  And speaking of which...


###My pockets are full...(The Jackenstein Conundrum)

My theory is this: I killed a boss, spent expensive ammo, probably paid multiple reconstruction fees when I died...I deserve to use or sell every single piece of loot that's part of my reward.  I've got 28 Inventory slots, and you've given me a room with 50 items in it. Jerk.  


Easy fix? Put a vending machine in loot rooms, or at least somewhere I can get to *from* the loot room without being locked out.


Lore-friendly fix that still takes thought/strategy? I propose ECHO-Scan:


* I can scan any item in my inventory, removing the physical item, and adding its value to a counter/debit-doohickey in my Echo device. This value is not usable as cash until... 


* Next time I'm at a vending machine, I can ""upload"" my ECHO-scanned items to the machine, and receive my payment in exchange for the weapon data (which would allow for construction and sale...or something lore-friendly like that).


In this scenario, I can pick up things until my inventory is full, scan vendor trash out of my inventory without losing the sell value, and I still need to pick and choose what's permanently ""destroyed"" via scanning, and what's kept as a physical, usable item.  Maybe I can pay Eridium or something to ""un-scan"" an item? Mehh... nice-to-have, not necessary.

1367984811.0,136,self.Borderlands,1dwtd2,I love UVHM - here's why,pgkelly,205,69,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1dwtd2/i_love_uvhm_heres_why/,"In normal and TVHM, you could more or less get through the game without putting too much thought into weapon selection, gear, or skill points. Farm a couple legendaries and go to town. Now that baddies have 4x the hp though, and do a bit more damage, things aren't so easy. 

UVHM forces you to be conservative with your skill points, thoughtful with your gear, and intelligent with your weapons. 

With 56 skill points you can capstone two skills. So long as you ignore the third tree and don't mind putting points into a couple skills you don't use. In actual gameplay, it's still better to pick the one capstone you absolutely must have and go for the first two levels of the others. After all, why put points into something you won't use? For example, thoughtlock is kinda useless. Why bother speccing into that tree when you could build up maya's middle tree for scorn and snag the health regen skills on the way? Why spec out for a slag turret when you could go for an explosives axton and all you really need are the rockets? Bottom line, if you aren't using a skill put the points elsewhere. 

If you are like me, you spent most of TVHM stockpiling class mods, shields, grenades, and relics. That's really all you should have in the bank, plus 2-3 of each in your backpack. Switching class mods or relics can be the difference between FFYL and winning, especially if you re-spec. Have a health relic on hand for when you gotta tank, and have a damage or allegiance relic on hand for when you gotta do damage. Have a couple shields on hand and switch out depending on the situation. Sham, neogenator, maybe a bee. Grenades, especially transfusion or leech grenades can be key. 

As for weapons, the legendaries we all farmed for are of limited usefulness. Moxxi's guns are what get you through UVHM. A slag rubi and you are pretty much set, it turns every grenade into a transfusion grenade. I found many blues to be very useful, as well as some purples. 

You will need to use slag, and every other element. It's best to have a slag, fire, corrosive, and shock weapon on hand. Yes, every character has a way to slag using skill points, but using a slag weapon is faster, does more damage, and doesn't have a cooldown.

UVHM forces you to optimize your character, respec frequently, and focus on particular playstyles. 

tl;dr I like UVHM because it makes you think about how you play the game. ",,False,self,t5_2r8cd,False,,,True,t3_1dwtd2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1dwtd2/i_love_uvhm_heres_why/,

Let me know what you guys think and if you have anything to add!

-----

-----

**UI Controls** (PC)

Controls should be consistent between gameplay and menus:

- A menu button should ALWAYS toggle that menu
- Drop should always drop
- Use should compare in menu
- Reload should inspect in menu
- Movement keys should  select menu
- Right click should cancel a multi-step interaction (maybe)

(I have Q bound to Inventory, along with having rebound almost every other key due to using ESDF, and it causes all sorts of interface issues)

- Mouse cursor should use a custom graphic; the default Windows cursor gets lost in the screen easily

- Mouse cursor should always default to the center of the screen when transitioning from gameplay to menu (but never when moving from one menu to another)

**Surround/Eyefinity** (PC)

- Text elements and pop-ups in cutscene videos appear off-screen
- Menu for Network Options and other submenus appear too large and run off-screen
- Popups for network status and friends joining/leaving appear too large and run off-screen
- Subtitles run by full screen width and span screen bezels; for readability, please limit to width of center screen
- Mouse cursor should default to center of the screen when opening the menu

**UI Activity**

- Challenge completions should list what has been completed as per challenge progress updates (e.g. ""Completed Challenge X part 1 *&lt;marquee effect&gt;* Killed 10 Skags by looking at them sternly""

- Challenge completion notifications should persist on-screen for about 50% longer than before

- Badass Rank updates should also indicate when a Badass Token has been awarded, along with the total number of Badass Tokens available to spend

- Ammo reserves for each ammo type should temporarily appear on-screen when ammo is looted or otherwise gained (e.g. through shield absorption)

- Minimap should be toggle-able and should have an option to scale independently of other UI/HUD elements

- Subtitles should appear in a sentence-by-sentence manner, rather than simply filling the screen left-to-right in series

- Story voiceovers and subtitles should have priority over all others

**Menus**

- Catch-A-Ride should save your previously used paint job for each vehicle across game sessions, and allow you to mark paint jobs as favourites with the red/gold star (and save individually for each vehicle type)

- New-U Station should let you mark skins and heads as favourites

- Starred inventory items should not be able to be sold until the star is removed, or should initiate a confirm dialog when attempting to sell them

- Ammo Dump should have a button to ""buy all"" and fill your ammo reserves (rockets excluded)

- Shops for unique-slot items (e.g. grenades and shields) should always show the item card for the item of that type which you have equipped

- ""Inspect"" screens should have an option to also list various DMG/DPS statistics (e.g. DMG*ROF, DMG*Crit)

- Story and mission voice logs should be re-listen-able

**Item Cards**

- Item cards for equipped items should ALWAYS show the text/effect frame, i.e. when comparing with items in the world, and when you draw your weapon

- Manufacturer effects should be listed as a bullet point beside the logo (or underneath the manufacturer and weapon-class icons), for clarity's sake

- Torgue effect should read ""Fires gyrojets instead of bullets"", for clarity's sake

- Elemental effects for grenade mods should be listed in the upper stats frame of the item card, as they are with weapons

- Zoom level should be communicated in the stats frame, especially for scoped weapons

**Gameplay**

- When joining a game session, new players should spawn at the latest SAVE point, rather than the latest New U station

- Ammo and money should be auto-looted regardless if they are in the world or in an opened container

- Auto-loot radius should be increased slightly to reach items that have fallen into objects or terrain

- Reviving should be triggerable through an additional command, as ""missing"" a revive can trigger a reload which then locks you out of being able to revive another player

- Badass Tokens should probably be able to be re-spec'd (personal opinion shared with a few other people)

- There should be a game option to toggle between ""weaponised"" and standard melee attacks when using weapons with bonus melee animations and damage

- Zer0's Decepti0n should highlight enemy crit locations with a red texture rather than a superimposed hexagon, and the transparency of enemies during Decepti0n should be reduced

**Splitscreen**

- (PS3/360) Menu/inventory screens cause noticeable slowdown

- (PS3/360) Splitscreen play should allow the second player to use their own PSN/XBL/local profile

-----

**BUGS**

- **Showstopping bug**: Players can be locked out of Tannis' intro scene and mission branch through some conjuction with Zed's mission ""Do No Harm""

- **Showstopping bug**: Some AMD processors present significant technical hurdles to getting the game to launch

- Some weapons that fire multiple bullets per shot also consume multiple bullets per shot without listing that effect in the item card's text frame

- Leaving iron sights while firing a Dahl burstfire stops the burstfire early

- Trade screens allow negative amounts of money to be traded, even when one or both players has $0

- Enemies can sometimes move, see, and/or shoot through objects

- Axton's second Gemini turret doesn't deploy if you try to deploy it too quickly after his first turret, but the combat-interrupting arm animation still plays

- Maya's Acid Cloud prevents critical hits from registering critical damage

- Moxxi sometimes does not successfully award items for the tipping challenge

- ""Trash"" marks on inventory items sometimes temporarily disappear when scrolling if they were marked during that menu session

- Panting during sprinting does not halt or disappear if a menu is entered while sprinting

- Inventory sometimes re-orders itself when items are sold

- Salvador sometimes does not automatically reload empty weapons while Gunzerking

- Item cards of in-world items do not consistently align themselves to be on-screen

- Enemies sometimes get ""stuck"" and will not move or react to enemies

- Various objects in the world have oversized, misaligned, or otherwise problematic collision bounds; a few terrain objects that appear walkable will block movement and must be jumped over

- Loot Goliaths will sometimes cause players to be stuck in terrain or objects if the player is underneath the Goliath when it dies

- Exiting a flipped vehicle will sometimes cause players to unrecoverably fall through terrain

- (PC) Menus sometimes do not ""complete"" actions such as equipping a new weapon from your backpack or switching from one skill tree to another (even using the on-screen arrows)

- Kill skill icons sometimes do not appear along the XP bar

- (PS3/360) Sniper rifle impact points sometimes do not line up correctly with their crosshair aim points

- (PC) LAN games drop when Steam drops its connection to the Community

- (PC) General intermittent problems with multiplayer connectivity and match session persistence

- Arena matches sometimes fail to spawn a wave of enemies, whereupon the round cannot be completed (may be related to Maya's Acid Cloud bug)

I main Zer0 with a sniper build, and anyone who has played that on UVHM knows that elemental sniper rifles are a necessity, and the best elemental sniper rifles are E-Tech (which seem to be coming out of the walls with the drop rat increase). Anyone who has used them knows that, with the amount of health enemies have on UVHM, feeding these sniper rifles (or any snoopr riffles, for that matter) requires ammunition I simply don't have. Between a stockpile relic and max'd SDUs, I can carry close to 200 rounds, and that gets completely eaten about midway through a firefight. Given Zer0's pathetically low health in this build, running around between ammo boxes is suicide.

In the first Borderlands, the high-tier COMs added ammo regeneration for the classes respective ammo types, as did certain weapons. This was great, because sniper rifles vacuum the ammo supply faster than a Shredifier. In Borderlands 2, Midgeasaurus McDualwield is the only class with ammo regeneration.

* His melee attacks cannot be dodged, even if you are far enough away from him

* After I shot off the poles on the top of his back, I could not for the life of me shoot his actual hitbox. I know it's in his chest, but it's just so small and he moves so quickly that I barely have time to hit it.


Basically, I do not really feel like even going after this jerk anymore. After dying countless times, and spending millions of dollars in New-U Respawns, it's just not worth it anymore.

Now, I just want to start by saying that borderlands 2 is, in my opinion, undeniably the superior game. The controls feel tighter, the writing is better, the game plays better overall, etc. however, in terms of plot and atmosphere, the first borderlands definitely wins. The first borderlands actually, to me, felt like an adventure. You were dropped into this unfamiliar planet and sent to follow your dream of opening the vault. You met a whole host of people, good and bad, before finally getting to the vault. BL2, to me, felt a lot more like a simple battle of good vs evil, with you merely a soldier for the raiders. In BL1, it felt like everyone was even, with a sense of 'you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours' and only a vague sense of who's morally in the right. In BL2, the moral roles felt a lot more black and white. The vault hunters were clearly the good guys and Jack clearly the bad guy. BL1 even felt better gameplay wise. more emphasis was put on the bits in between areas, like the Dahl Headland and the Arid Hills. it felt like you were actuslly searching for the vault, travelling across a vast expanse of land in search of the ultimate treausre, in BL2, areas like 3 horns jjst felt like filler in between massive bandit camps and hyperion strongholds. In my opinion, the approach BL1 took made for a greater adventure which felt more satisfying, but that's not to say it's a better game than bl2.

I don't claim to be correct about everything, and never did most of the dlc/side missions concerning Atlas' full involvement in BL1, so feel free to point anything about that out.

I put together a map showing the locations of Michael Mamaril in Sanctuary.

On the Xbox he has a ~95% spawn rate (it is glitched as most of you already know) unless I've missed a location.

I've got blues and purples from him, roughly 120 total 5-6 being purple quality. I've only been able to check this at the level 9 and level 13 range. The loot he gives seems to scale based on your progress in the story.

Thought this would be helpful to anyone having trouble finding him for the achievement or wanted to check for him to get the extra gun when they where in Sanctuary.

Edit: Though I would add text descriptions of where he is exactly to make it clearer, save you some time.

* Inside the Crimson Raiders HQ next to the stairs up to the bank.
* Next to the newspaper stand in the big courtyard
* Up the stairs next to the Secret Stash
* Inside Dr. Zed's
* Under the stairs in Scooter's
* By a white box in a small alley off the path between Moxxi's and Scooters on the south side of the map
* In Moxxi's by the bar next to the Slots
* In Moxxi's across from Sir Hammerlock, next to a green piano. (He hides behind a box with speakers on it so you may miss him if you are rushing around.)
* To the right of Crazy Earl's

Incredibly powerful,ericdjobs,149,19,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/10mmjq/tediore_weapon_throw_amp_shields_is_this_a_bug_is/,"So.. I was playing around doing some testing... and I've discovered something that's either flat out broken or simply amazing.

We all know that with Tediore weapons, the damage you do when thrown is equal to every round in the clip.. (So, 50 rounds clip, each round does 1,000 damage on said target... 50,000 weapon throw.. or whatever)  This can make equal some amazing damage if used properly...

Here's the interesting part.. if you equip an amp shield, it appears as if the amp damage amount is added to every single round in the clip during the throw (if you throw while amp is up).. without even draining your shield!  So, if you have a 10k Amp shield, and a Tediore weapon with a clipsize of 50 remaining... and each round does 1,000.. instead of a 50,000 weapon throw, it will be 550,000 damage.

I can't even imagine what kind of damage this would do with The Bee... 

Here's a short video showing you exactly how this works.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiqT6inu8zc

I have SMGs that do upwards of 18,000 a hit (because of Siren SMG damage increase mods, plus elemental against flesh).. so if it was Tediore with a 32 clip, it would do 576K damage normally.  With a 10k amp shield, that becomes 896K.  Now, let's say we have ""The Bee""... that becomes a staggering 2,016,000 damage for a weapon throw.

1. Go to [Hayter's Folly](http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Hayter%27s_Folly) and walk up to the door where [Master Gee the Invincible](http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Master_Gee_the_Invincible) is hiding. 

2. A side effect of touching that door is you are now set to ""4 player"" mode, as if you had 3 friends with you. You can confirm this by picking up ammo for a gun type that you are already maxed out on. 

3. Head to [Tundra Express](http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Tundra_Express) and find ""Old Man Johnson's Farm"". Inside his barn is a switch which disables the electricity to the nearby eaten house. Disable that electricity!

4. Head on down into that house to find a great save point.

Now we need some damage. The only REAL requirement is an [Evil Smasher](http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Evil_Smasher) + a good weapon, I use a caustic [Infinity Pistol](http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Infinity) or my [Unkempt Harold](http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Unkempt_Harold). 

1. Fire one shot, then reload the [Evil Smasher](http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Evil_Smasher). Before the gun finishes reloading, quickly swap away and back. This will cause the black cloud glitch to occur, after which all other guns will ALSO have the black cloud special ability (Reloading will occasionally drastically raise all stats of the gun, the more capacity the stronger the gun). 

2. Repeat step 1 quickly, if the gun explodes 2+ times in a row while quickly swapping the boost will stack MORE, making more explosions likely and the amount of boost higher. 

3. Stop mashing the reload buttons and swapping the gun. Go slower, and when the [Evil Smasher](http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Evil_Smasher) has very low bullets left (So 11 shots out of 200 or something instead of 11/12), stop and swap to your good gun. 

I managed to get my infinity to 239 bullets after 10 - 20 minutes, each pellet fired did around 1.3 million or so non-critical (And of course, fire rate ALSO went up). 

FINALLY, lets get [Vermivorous the Invincible](http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Vermivorous_the_Invincible)!

1. Get into the loft of ""[Old Man Johnson's Farm](http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Tundra_Express)"" and shoot towards the bugs. Sometimes I run jumping through them (I have a 72k turtle shield) just to get them riled up, but ALWAYS retreat to the loft. 

2. Keep the bugs interested. You don't have to hit them, or hurt them. Just shoot the ground, or kill any small ones that annoy you. 

3. There is no required number of bugs needed, there is no items that help/hurt your chances, but we already tricked the game into set us into 4 player mode, so WOO! Better odds. 

4. If he shows up, kill him. If it takes a LONG time and NO one is evolving, kill them all and go get more bugs. There are some straight downhill from the farm and some to the right in a valley... just jump around them until they get to adult or badass stage, then RUN back to base (Shooting around them if they lose interest). 


I wish I had known that this special ""MORE CHANCE"" + ""Norquest"" thing was going on, it took away my special feeling for getting 6 norquests... ah well. Got one of each type. 

Heads up, sometimes the thing gets hurled FAR away... like almost into another area far.

So, you've been trying to kill the new raid boss(es).  Having trouble?

Allow me to offer some insight.

Before we get started, let me start by saying that this is ***NOT*** a method of how to solo, do this quickly, etc.  This is merely for how to *kill* the damn things.

Let's begin;

****

###Who are they?

****

First off, the new boss(es) are the Ancient Dragons of Destruction.  They're four Dragons in total, and they each represent one of the elements.  Not only that, but they each have a specific bonus that compliments the other Dragons.

You'll have to forgive me, but I can't remember the names right now (if someone has the names, I'd be happy to go back and edit).  So I will refer to the Dragons by their Element.

**SLAG**:  This guy has the slag element, and also boosts the damage of the other Dragons (His name is Boost something the invincible).  This guy is your first target.  More on this later.  As far as his attacks, they seem to be bites, and Slag beams, akin to The Warrior.

**SHOCK**: This is your next target.  His name is Healthiamamallamadingdong.  Basically, he boosts the health of all the Dragons.  He'll be a pain to kill, because he has so much health himself, but he will make your fight with the other Dragons easier, provided you can take him down.  His attacks range from bites, to shock waves, and shock balls.  This guy also heals his friends when he lands.  If he does a shock aura, but doesn't actually do damage to you, he's healing.

**CORROSIVE**: His name is Brood-something-or-other.  This guy spawns little dragons (handy for second winds), BUT he also grows in power for every Invincible Dragon you kill.  This is why I would recommend killing him after Shock.  He spews corrosive goop on you, and spawns little dragons who drop stuff for you (ammo, sometimes green weapons).

**FIRE**: This guy is a sumabitch.  I can't/haven't been able to tell *what* he offers to the rest of the Dragons, but I think he's strictly damage.  I don't remember the name, but his attacks are a pain in the assholes.  He'll light the arena on fire, in a circular pattern, coming up through the floor.  Breathes fire ***A LOT***, and will also put his wings in front of himself. When he folds his wings up like that, and listen/read closely...

###STOP. SHOOTING. ANYTHING.

Those wings now *reflect* damage back to you.  Any damage. Bullets, rockets, grenades, Turrets.  Just stop.

EDIT: I used a Shock-O-Negative on this asshole last night, and I didn't get any damage reflected back to me.  Will require some more testing, but I think grenades are safe to use.

Now that we have the baddies listed, what do we do next?

****

###The Gear

****

So the first thing you wanna do, is get shields that have a ***huge*** capacity.  You're gonna be taking a lot of damage throughout this fight.  If you have someone in your group who can heal/regen the group, great (looking at you, Sirens).  My group of four decided after the 20th try, ""Hey... Let's try the *Hoplite*.""

Worked like a charm.  All four of us rarely went down, and it seemed to do the trick as far as tanking damage.

The Hoplite drops from Pyro Pete (the Invincible) from the Campaign of Carnage DLC, in the bar at The Beatdown (for those who don't know).

The next thing we did, was bring along some Explosives.  We found that this did the most damage for us.  We couldn't tell if other elements actually had an effect on the other Dragons (elements and what not), so that still needs to be determined.  I'd imagine slag helps, but there's no noticeable 'slag' marking.  We had Turrets that were slagging for us, so... I dunno. 

Now, for the actual fight.

****

###HERE, THERE BE DRAGONS

****

First thing that happens after starting the fight, is the four baddies pop up.  Now, in regards to this fight, whatever one you shoot at/hit first, will be the one who *lands*.  So ***DON'T*** drop any robots/turrets at the start of this fight.

First one up that you wanna bring down is Shock.  He heals his buddies, and has the most health, along with boosting the health of his comrades.  

Next one after this should be Fire.  He does the most damage to you, and is the most annoying.  Watch for the wings.  When he folds up his wings, he lights the floor on fire. So watch the floor instead of him when he's shielding him self.

After that, go Corrosive.  He levels up with each Dragon killed, and you'll want to take him out before Slag.  Granted, he'll already be a 67/68, so it'll take some time.  But he'll spawn little dragons, allowing you to get some kill skills to help take this guy down.

Finally, mop up with Slag.  He'll slag you quite a bit, but stay out of his attack range, and you should be fine.

****

### Conclusion

****

Is this the best set of strategy/info for this? No, not at all.  I'm just a filthy, casual console peasant.  But this *did* work for us.

Your reward for killing this Monstrosities is a fuck-ton of D20 chests, and Eridium from the dragons.

Have fun!

Mainly because he's one of the quickest/easiest bosses to farm, so it made for some easy stats. First, my build:

* Level 50 Gunzerker

* Level 48 Lyuda @ ~13k damage

* Level 50 Bee

* Vault Hunter's Relic

And, the spoils of my labor:

**Amount of loot**

* Number of single-item loot drops: 462

* Number of double-item loot drops: 25

* Number of multi-item (3+) drops: 2

* Number of no-loot (cash/eridium ONLY) drops: 11

**Loot quality**

* Number of white items: 42

* Number of green items: 475

* Number of blue items: 1

* Number of purple items: 0

* Number of orange items: 0

So, even with my trusty Vault Hunter's relic equipped, looks like I got the short end of the stick in terms of loot. I was seriously more likely to see an Infinity on the loading screen (twice, actually) than dropped from the good doctor. And, even if my very next kill nets me an orange, we're looking at a 0.19% drop rate on oranges, at least from Doc Mercy (*after* accounting for the Vault Hunter's relic). On that note, does anybody know if specific bosses have different rates?

Is your game getting stale because your character is at max level with a lot of great loot? Do enemies seem to just die at your feet from a few shots from your amped conference call? 

If any of those rhetorical questions applied to you, or if you're just looking for a more challenging experience, then this guide is for you!

THINGS YOU WILL NEED:
---

1. [Gibbed's Borderlands 2 Save Editor](http://www.se7ensins.com/forums/threads/borderlands-2-save-editor-revision-125.798767/)

2. Borderlands 2 Save File

HOW TO MAKE THE GAME HARDER:
---
[1. Extract and Open Gibbed's Borderlands 2 Save Editor]

[2. Open the borderlands save (.sav) file you wish to edit]

[3. Head on over to the ""raw"" tab in the save editor]

[4. Scroll Down the page until you reach the value listed as ""RegionGameStages"" and click on ""(collections)"" to its right.]

[5. Once clicked, a new window will pop up labled as ""Collection Editor""]

[6. Take notice of the left pane, you will see a list of entries all labeled as ""RegionGameStageData."" Each of these entries contains values that tell the game what region should be affected, and what level a particular region should be.]

[7. Click on a RegionGameStageData entry and alter its ""GameStage"" value to something greater than 50. The enemies in that region will then spawn at the listed level. (Missions for that region will also scale accordingly)]

EXAMPLES OF FUN STAGES TO EDIT:
---
""GD_GameStages.Zone3.ThresherRaid""

This region controls what level Terramorphous the Invincible spawns at. When setting his level remember that the game will automatically spawn him 2 levels higher than the region stage (setting him to 50 will have him spawn at 52 etc). Try setting this to 65 (This is the highest i've tried, it takes a fully decked out level 50 character with some buddies to take him down)

""GD_GameStages.Zone3.FinalBoss""

This region controls what level The Warrior spawns at. 

HOW TO RE-ACCEPT PREVIOUSLY COMPLETED MISSIONS:
---
[1. Extract and Open Gibbed's Borderlands 2 Save Editor]

[2. Open the borderlands save (.sav) file you wish to edit]

[3. Head on over to the ""raw"" tab in the save editor]

[4. Scroll Down the page until you reach the value listed as ""MissionPlaythroughs"" and click on ""(collections)"" to its right.]

[5. Once clicked, a new window will pop up labled as ""Collection Editor""]

[6. Take notice of the left pane, you will see a list of entries all labeled as ""MissionPlaythroughData"" Each of these entries contain all accepted/completed missions from each of your playthroughs. (Playthrough's are noted on the right pane through the value ""PlayThroughNumber"" and have a value of (0-x) With zero being your initial first playthrough, and x being whatever else followed (tvhm).]

[7. Click on the middle MissionPLaythroughData entry (it should be listed with a PlayThroughNumber value of ""1"" (tvhm playthrough)]

[8. Once the appropriate MissionPlaythroughData is selected, look at the right pane and click on ""(Collection)"" next to ""MissionData"".]

[9. Another Collection Editor Window will open up listing on the left pane all the Missions you have completed. Simply click on the ""MissionData"" entry you want to replay and delete the entry from the list using the red "" X "" button/icon in the collection editor.]

[10. Mission titles are listed in the ""MissionData"" entries as ""Mission"" followed by the appropriate string (example: GD_Z3_RobotSlaughter.M_RobotSlaughter_1) ]

Your bro want to play skyrim while you borderlands it up? No problem! Girlfriend want to play portal while you play TF2? No worries! I won't go through the exact procedures on how to get each game to play nice, but PM me if you can't figure it out. 

I got it working last night using Sandboxie and IndieVolume.   
 


Startup one version of borderlands using a shortcut, and make sure you start it in sandboxie. You will need to add a couple settings to the end of the ""Target"" in the properties of the shortcut. I know one of them is -AlwaysFocus, but you will need the tweak that lets you set the X position, Y position, and the controller offset (a.k.a. use player 1 controller or player 2 controller {referring to Xbox controllers}). 


What I use for Player 1 (-AlwaysFocus -ControllerOffset=1)

What I use for Player 2 (-AlwaysFocus -SaveDataId=2 -WindowPosX=0 -WindowPosY=0)

Then start another version of borderlands outside of sandboxie. You can also add the -AlwaysFocus, x and y positions as well as the controller offset, but with my setup, I didn't actually need these on this version. I also settled on one person gets the controller, the other uses mouse and keyboard.  

 One of your steam sessions will go into offline mode. This is ok. You will be playing LAN anyway. 

Also, IndieVolume allows you to tell one of your versions of borderlands to go to a different audio output. This lets player 1 use this headset and player 2 use a different one. Again, I settled on one person gets the headset, the other gets the speakers, but I finished this at midnight last night. 

Any questions? Comments? Concerns?

[Here](http://forums.gearboxsoftware.com/showthread.php?t=151336) is a thread from the gearbox forums with a bunch of useful launch options.

This way you can very easily play with a Kb+M and 360 controller combo.

Deleting / renaming component folders is not usually a good idea.**

**-- .NET Fix --**

When you first start Borderlands 2 through Steam you will have a .NET repairer or installer. When it is finished it will say you need to restart your computer. Just click ""RESTART LATER"" and the BL2 splash screen will come up.

To prevent it from doing this on every start up through Steam you will want to go to your Steam Library, Right click on Borderlands 2, Click on the Local Files tab, Select Verify Integrity of Game Cache... It should find 1 file missing and fix that file...

You will not need to restart your computer through this entire process.... Hopefully this will stay near the top or get stickied for the wave of people having issues as they get home from work/school later today...


**-- Alternative .NET Fix --**

u/epsiblivion has posted a folder permissions issue that may very well help everyone... 

&gt;I HAVE FOUND A FASTER WAY TO FIX THE .NET PROBLEM

&gt;on gearbox forum the guy says to go the your install folder and make it not read-only. do this by

&gt; - going to C:\program files\steam\steamapps\common and right click on borderlands 2.
&gt; - click on properties
&gt; - uncheck read-only under attributes
&gt; - click ok
&gt; - now relaunch the game
&gt; - .net should update one more time
&gt; - game launches after without asking for restart.
&gt; - quit game. relaunch. no .net update.
&gt; - play BL2

[[Link]](http://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/10301f/psa_net_install_issue_fix_for_steam_other_launch/c69zc4e)

u/Daily_concern has added this solution to [PC Gaming Wiki](http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Borderlands_2#Microsoft_.NET_Framework_Client_Profile_Restarting_Install) as well.

**-- SKIP LAUNCHER, STRAIGHT TO BL2 --**

&gt;If you wish to run the game without the Launcher, you can right-click on the ""Borderland 2"" game in the Steam client, select 'Properties' and click on the ""Set Launch Options"" and add ""-NoLauncher"" and when you click on Borderlands 2 in Steam, it will run the game immediately instead of always displaying the launcher.

**-- TROUBLE CONNECTING TO FRIENDS --**

This is an existing problem from Borderlands 1. You can try changing who is the ""host"" or look into port forwarding. Also, user sp00t came up with the clever idea of using [Hamachi](https://secure.logmein.com/products/hamachi/download.aspx) as a temporary workaround. I have never used Hamachi so I cannot provide a guide on that but I believe you'll want to pursue the Unmanaged route.

**-- GEARBOX SHIFT --**

After you sign up for Gearbox Shift, You will only recieve an email to confirm your email account. You will not receive a code in a seperate email to enable Golden Keys, they will be rewarded automatically after connecting your account. You will receive anywhere between 1-3 keys.

**-- OTHER ISSUES / COMMON QUESTIONS --**

~~GreenManGaming (and maybe GameStop) pre orders are currently not receiving the pre-order keys. It is a well known issue at this time. Be patient and wait.~~ Edit - It appears Pre Order bonuses are starting to appear for Steam players now.

Golden Keys appear to be 1 time use per account (not per character). When a player uses a key in a Co-op/Multiplayer game it appears to use other players keys as well should those players have a Golden Key.

Still worth noting to be careful.*

If you have a Borderlands 1 save file on your computer you can get Loyalty Perks. These are additional customizations for the characters. No additional perks are known at this time. [[Pic]](http://gameshotpedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/4489_BorderlandsII.jpg)

You have to post in this specific thread to qualify.  Before I gift you, I will need and imgur link proof that you are subbed to this subreddit.  I don't want someone who is not apart of this community to get this treat.  This is a great community and it needs to build IMO.

Contest:
Basically make me happy, convince me I need to give you the copy.  Do whatever you can, just be nice and fun about it.  Tell a joke or a good story, draw something, show me your (man)boobs, I don't care.  If it makes me laugh or inspires me or what have you, if I like it, I'll give you the copy.  The only thing I ask is please leave this for people who are not fortunate enough to buy the game on their own.  I don't want to give this copy away because someone wanted to save 50$, I want to give someone this copy because I want to help someone who's YEARNING for this game but can't play and is in agony waiting.  That's who I want to help.

I'm just wanting to do a fun thing, I've been a dick lately, trying to pay it forward.  I'll PM you if I'm considering you to be a winner.

Edit:  Hey guys, just wanted to let you know I'm still looking at the thread, I haven't had much time to read because of work.  I want to say that the reason why I'm doing this, isn't just to feel good, it's three-fold.

I'm doing this because of Karma, not Reddit Karma, but RL Karma.  i want to be a good person and I don't feel like I have been for a very long time.  Been going through a lot of depression lately.  I'm also doing this because yes, it feels good to give.  Lastly, and the main reason why I'm doing this, is because of *Randy Fuckin Pitchford.*  He is a glorious human being, he's doing everything right.  Gearbox is making this generation's Diablo 2.  Not to mention just the Borderlands series, but they are making a CANONICAL SEQUEL to Aliens!!  Plus with the eulogy and the wedding announcement, Gearbox *really* cares about the community.  I can see that, and it's not just a marketing ploy, you can see they are genuine.  I feel safe that ACM is going to be an absolute blockbuster of a game, and everyone knows BL2 is going to be our Diablo 2.  I played D2 when I was a kid for a long time but it's time for BL2 to become the new staple of fun.

Update 2: I'm reviewing the submissions now, I'll be done within the hour, Raw is coming on soon. AND ZOMG IF YOU ARENT WATCHING WRESTLING NOW YOU'RE MISSING GOOD STUFFS.   Anywho, reviewing stuff and all that.

Update 3:  I'm reading everything, regardless of upvotes, if you got downvoted by some unsavory dirtbags illegitimately, fear not.  Just wanted to clear that up for some

Update 4:  Still Reading... 5:01 PM

Update 5: I have chosen three winners instead of one, I couldn't help myself.  Congrats to those who won, and thanks for the awesome stories.  I'd love to give everyone a copy but this is bursting the wallet as is.  I just wanted to show love for this community and celebrate a fucking fantastic game coming out.  I love you Gearbox.

P.S.S Are you guys wanting proof that I delivered?

**Destroy tough enemies**, I was able to snuff out badasses, goliaths, bosses, and anything with a pulse very quickly. Groups are a touch harder to deal with but unloading 2 guns into an enemy's face will take them down very very fast. I never worried about bosses, not a one even gave me a challenge with the gunzerker. 

**Combos!** Using a slag SMG &amp; Corrosive shotgun was one of my most devastating combos, i could melt robots and regular enemies alike. The ability to unload with 2 elemental effects at once should not be overlooked. The gunzerker can be surpsingly tactical if you want him to be

**Shield, Life &amp; Ammo regen**, In a pinch you can gunzerk to regenerate just about everything, and this is super handy when running low on ammo. Just duck behind some cover while gunzerking and come back out ready to fight. This is also a good trick if you need to pick a teammate up who is surrounded by enemies. 

**Never think about ammo**, I played the rampage tree, and my favorite skill was the first. With 5 points i had a 50% chance of not spending ammo per shot, thus a 2 round shotgun could dish out 3, 4, even as high as 10 rapid fire shots before i actually had to reload.

The average psycho is imbued with an above average metabolism, a below average IQ, and an insatiable thirst for meat... Of any kind. Upon discovering this, I began to form a hypothesis on the origins of their psychosis. My idea is that a combination of their singular diet and the New-U system has caused a modified version of Kuru to evolve on this planet, specifically within the brain of the psycho. As we all know Kuru is a prion based condition, a form of Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, similar to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). All variations of these types of conditions cause massive neurological and psychological changes to occur within the patient (Kuru being anecdotally referred to as the laughing sickness). 

All forms of Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, however, cause massive physical deteriorations as well. My theory is that originally the psychos were average pandorans, who consumed human brain tissue. Upon contracting Kuru they expired, and were brought back using New- U technology, allowing variations of the prions to incubate within a host for unprecedented amounts of time. Essentially, the prions were regenerated, along with the individual, eventually allowing the prions to mutate into a “Human-stable” form. At this point, all that is required for transmission to a new host would be the consumption of brain tissue from patient zero by any other unfortunate cannibal, an unfortunately familiar site to any who have been here before.

However, after such an expansive journey, I just expected so much more out of the final boss.  I literally hid behind a pillar and unloaded eight full magazines from my Bulldog into the damn thing, and it never even drove my health into the red zone.

1375633971.0,113,self.Borderlands,1jop4i,So just how hard will enemies be at level 72? Bahroo explains.,NOTHESPIKEYAVENGER,138,25,149,http://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1jop4i/so_just_how_hard_will_enemies_be_at_level_72/,"I was going through the gearbox forums, and found this thread from Bahroo http://forums.gearboxsoftware.com/showthread.php?t=308232 

He has found out, if scaling stays the same, how much harder the enemies at level 72 will be. He quotes...

Later experimentation showed that the blue line for player health in the cool but scary graph heycarnut made was based on an inaccurate constant from the wiki. Based on the scaling values of 1.13/1.141 which appear to be empirically correct based on testing by Bahroo, we get:

1.13^(72-61) = 3.84
1.141^(72-61) = 4.27

So, For current scaling, to determine gear, damage and HP values at L72, multiply the L61 values by the following constants:

Things related to player damage or health: 3.84
Things related to enemy damage or health: 4.27

Normalizing the mob power increase to player power increase tells us how much ""harder"" it should be, mathematically. Enemy health/damage increase normalized to player increase: 1.112, or between 11% and 12% ""harder"". Let's just say 12% to be reasonably safe.

tl;dr, at L72: 
it will seem about 12% more difficult to kill a given enemy than at L61.
you will be hit about 12% harder than you were at 61.

This is all assuming everything stays like it is now for scaling, and that the numbers are accurate.

To see the graphs they talk about, just click the link.  12% Doesn't sound like a lot, but the weapon power scales much slower than enemy health, and your health and shields barely scale at all. Terra will have 11 BILLION HEALTH.  Master Gee will have 40 BILLION HEALTH.  This is getting pretty ludicrous, huh?  

In my opinion, it will be as hard as the jump from TVHM to UVHM.  People will complain for good reason, but they will get over it.  

So If UVHM was hard for you, prepare for a similar experience.

Tl;Dr  Prepare for some tough enemies at 72.

EDIT: I'll keep my eyes on the forums when the scaling method is confirmed, and I'll probably make a followup post then.

People joke when in the Zelda games, Link goes around running into other people's homes, smashing their pots, looting their chests for rupees, he's a criminal.  We're no better.  Someone spent the time and effort to lug a giant chest with guns and relics onto the top of a building's roof or into a locked jail cell, but we go in loot them.  We go around killing everyone that looks at us just because we're convinced they would try to kill us.  We're thieves and murderers.  

So the challenge is this: do not open any chests or boxes (that's stealing) and do not kill anyone unless they aggro you first (IE self defense).  You can take items given to you (like quest rewards or Claptrap's first gun) and you can buy stuff from vending machines with earned money.  I'm a little unsure on collecting stuff off dead bodies if you had to kill them in self defense... would that be looting?  You can't help picking up ammo and cash since that's automatic.

I was just wondering if it would be possible, just like playing Grand Theft Auto while obeying all the traffic laws and not killing anyone. Thoughts?",,False,self,t5_2r8cd,False,,,True,t3_11weob,http://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/11weob/challenge_is_jack_right/,

1347887950.0,112,self.Borderlands,100r72,Do you live in Europe? Here's how to unlock the Steam version early using a VPN.,falousco,153,41,254,http://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/100r72/do_you_live_in_europe_heres_how_to_unlock_the/,"This guide will allow you to play the game early for your time-zone, you will gain access to the game at the same time Americans do, which is in roughly 14 hours after this post.

Now, before I get into the guide I want to say the following: Steam will not ban for using a VPN. The only reason they will ban for you using a VPN is if you use it to get the game cheaper from another region or sometimes if you constantly switch your VPN location, Steam can lock your account since to Steam it appears like it has been accessed from a number of different countries in a short time span.

Now, to the guide.

**BEFORE USING THE VPN AT ALL, NOTE THAT YOU CAN ONLY CONNECT TO A TRIAL ACCOUNT 3 TIMES A DAY, SO MAKE SURE YOU DON'T USE THEM UP BEFORE YOU CAN UNLOCK BORDERLANDS!!**

1. Pre-load Borderlands 2, you can do this already regardless of your country.

2. Go to the [FlyVPN (VPN software) download page](http://www.flyvpn.com/download) and grab their client, I recommend the 'Lite' download as you don't need any special features.

3. Go to the [FlyVPN trial page](http://www.flyvpn.com/freetrial) and note down the free trial account username/password (NB: The trial account changes every 20 minutes, so if the log-in details don't work, the account has probably changed - go to the trial page again for the new password).

4. Exit Steam.

5. Put the trial username/password into the FlyVPN program client and hit connect.

6. Connect to a US node, this causes your connection to appear to Steam like you are in the US, allowing you to unlock the game at the same time they do.

7. Open Steam again, log in and run Borderlands 2 in your game library whilst still connected to the trial VPN.

8. The game will unlock, exit it once it has done so, set Steam to offline mode and then restart Steam.

9. Enjoy the game! It will have unlocked now and you can close FlyVPN.

**(Note: If you go online in Steam after unlocking it, the game can sometimes relock, so the decision is up to you.)**

Any questions, just post them here.

In the bit where you get into place to glitch into the wall (immediately before he goes up) you only have to push forward and jump.

It takes a little practice to get the hang of but once you master it you can get to 14 or so chests in 5 minutes. Feel free to ask any questions if you're having trouble.
