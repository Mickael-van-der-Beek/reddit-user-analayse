In my private discussions on the subject up to this point I have repeatedly heard this defended by claims that real science isn't funny enough for shittyaskscience. I vehemently beg to differ.

It was always my goal as a shitty scientist to apply good scientific principles to completely absurd concepts, however when both the concept and the science are nonsense then all you have is nonsense, and we are reduced to a collection of bad puns and pantomime quackery. 

Gentlemen and ladies of the scientific academy, this will not do.

I thoroughly hope I am not wrong, and that this community will continue to cherish science in all its shitty glory. Please, discuss.
