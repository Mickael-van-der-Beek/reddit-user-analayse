I started commuting in January to school (10 mi Round Trip) and since riding to school, biking has become a bit of a thing now, (~2,500 miles since I picked up my bike in January/710 miles since I picked up an odometer in August) and I absolutely love it. 

I'm not going to lie, I used to look down on biking, and now, I can't imagine why I did. It's so awesome to have the wind blowing in my face, getting to school and knowing I have helped do my part in lowering gas prices for everyone else (my car is a 4.7L Jeep, last time I went to a gas station must have been in July), as well as helping free up parking for everyone else who HAS to commute by car. 

It really hit me today as my young, able-bodied neighbor and I both pulled out (she was in her new Civic/me in my now beat up road bike), and I basically beat her to the grocery store. I carry a rucksack to the grocery store for the days when I really need to stock up on food and beer, and to me, it is absolutely senseless to actually start up a car, drive the quarter mile to the grocery store to pick up something that could very easily be carried in a backpack. 

But to all of you, commuting by bike is good for the heart, soul, and the environment. Not to mention, there is some sort of camaraderie in commuting by bike that I have come to notice. 

Stay safe, and keep on keeping on!  ",,False,self,t5_2tbmq,False,,,True,t3_10uw4i,http://www.reddit.com/r/bikecommuting/comments/10uw4i/to_all_you_commuters/,

He blasted through the intersection and past the cross-traffic to a reaction that quickly escalated from alarm to confusion to anger. Once he had shot through and cars were able to go through at their normal paces, I could see a few disgusted glances in my direction like I was a shepherd that simply looked on passively as his lambs were slaughtered by a solitary wolf.


And to top it off, this is the second time this week I've stopped at a light while the cyclist behind me ignores it.

-Lighten your load. I drive to work Mondays and take all the stuff I will need for the week.

-Leave early:  ride slow, sweat less, more time to cool down

-Helmet Helmet Helmet: I almost got hit today from some girl on her phone trying to California Stop a right turn on a red light.

I only found this sub reddit a few days ago, but if any one has a few more tips (other than on the sidebar). it would be appreciated.

Something that I notice happening all the time is drivers yield unnecessarily.

 For instance, I'll be approaching a four way stop, with a car that's reached the intersection before me. Normally I go through stop signs if there aren't any cars, but in this situation I stop, of course. As soon as I come to a stop, the driver will give me the wave. I appreciate the act of kindness, but it's really confusing if you're not looking at the driver and just waiting for them to go. The same thing happens at two way stops, where I have to stop and they don't. That's when it becomes frustrating, because I'm trying to figure out what the hell they're doing. Again, I appreciate the kindness, but it's confusing. 

Finally, I'll sometimes approach a large intersection with left turn lanes. I'll have a green light, but I'm plenty far from the intersection, maybe ten seconds. People will appear to go, but pull out into the intersection. Sometimes I'll give them the wave, since they have more than enough time, but usually they just keep waiting. 

Not sure why this happens to me so much. Do you guys experience the same sort of thing?

When I tell you I'm the laziest person in the world, and don't exercise (except for when I dance) even though I know I should, I kid you not. I haven't consistently exercised in years.
  
Well, this summer for the past 6 weeks I got an internship in a new location. And, since I don't have a car nor a license yet, I had to figure out how to get to and from work. Well, my landlord let me borrow his bike and when he doesn't drive me, I would ride to and fro work.

The transition was terrible. My work is about 3.5 miles away with alot of hills and the first day that I had to ride to work I stopped to walk so many times it was embarrassing. Yeah, my body was so not ready for this. That first day, it took me about 50 minutes to get to work (yeah 3.5 miles) and I was simply exhausted and sweaty. Well these past 6 weeks, I slowly noticed as my endurance went up and my legs strengthened and quit yelling at me to stop. It went from me stopping at random moments, to me stopping only at hills, then this week, me riding the whole way through in 20-25 minutes. I'm sure I can do it under that time but the lights, traffic, and sidewalks all seem to be conspiring against me. 

I'm just amazed at all you people riding 10+ miles commutes in record times and that's pure commitment in my eyes. Cycling is definitely a big deal and its so rewarding when you feel your body getting stronger throughout the weeks. When I get back to school, I will make sure to go to that gym, and hit the bike, so I won't lose all my progress.

So from a previously thin yet unhealthy, to a now semi-healthy girl who's eating right to sustain my cycling, I SALUTE YOU ALL and wish you long, tiring, but worthwhile bike rides and commutes.",,False,self,t5_2tbmq,False,,,True,t3_1kgajl,http://www.reddit.com/r/bikecommuting/comments/1kgajl/i_gotta_say_i_admire_each_and_every_one_of_you/,

Saving a few dollars in gas will be nice as well.

I put some specialized road tires on it Friday night.  I did a test run on Saturday morning and it went pretty good.  I live 13 miles from the office and drove to the midway point and cycled in from there.  My calves were sore as well as my back but I ought to get used to that.

I did the same 6 mile ride in this morning only to pop a tire about 4 blocks short.  At least that is where I realized it was flat.  I plan to drive to the halfway point for a couple weeks while I get used to riding the bike in. There is a cool mini bike shop [BTC](http://bicycletransitcenter.com/) that I was headed to that has showers and lockers for $12 a month.  My office is only 2 blocks from the shop so its really convenient.

I have to head back over at lunch to fix my tire so it will be ready for the ride home.  I know the bike isn't much but I wanted to ride in for a while before I spend $$$ on a bike to make sure I will do it. The bike needs some work and a general tune up pretty bad but it manages until I can get that done.

EDIT:  Today (6/20) I did the whole ride in from my house to the office.  Per the strava app it ended up being 12.3 miles, average speed 16.5 mph, and took me 47 minutes.

Behind me there is a long line of cars and I'm trying to figure out what is going to be the safest way for me to get past this blockage. So the light turns green and I start pedaling, and looking back. I reach the blocked off section and look back when I realize the first car is holding back traffic in my lane and waves at me so I can get in the lane and avoid the section.

But I thought I'd share an experience I had on my commute today that helped me realize that not all drivers are assholes. Just like, not all cyclists are assholes. 

I needed to get into the left hand turn lane at the light just ahead, but there was a line of cars starting to pass me. I let one pass and saw that there was enough space between that car and the one behind it to get though. I quickly merged into the turn lane and stopped at the light, but I forgot to signal. Then I heard a woman's voice, slightly annoyed, say ""Next time you do that, please signal."" I turned around, ready to give her some smart ass response because I had plenty of time to get though. She didn't have to stop short, and she wasn't close to hitting me. I looked her in the eyes and realize that she has a right to be annoyed. She didn't know I needed to turn, and I basically cut her off. So I stopped myself and said the only thing that I thought was appropriate. ""I apologize."" She looked a bit surprised that a college aged student on a fixie would have that response, and said ""It just surprised me, I would hate to have hit you!"" Now I was surprised. I expected to be lectured on how I should ride on the sidewalk, but nope. So I said ""Well I appreciate your concern. I'll try to be more predictable from now on."" The light turned green, and she smiled and said ""Ride safe"" as she drove off and that was the end of it. 

Like just about everyone on this sub, I think that cyclists deserve just as much of the road as cars do. I take the lane, and I ride like I'm just another vehicle, but today I made a mistake.

Advice?,skelly421,30,4,60,http://www.reddit.com/r/bikecommuting/comments/1ihtg1/thinking_about_selling_my_car_to_become_a/,"I recently became a bike commuter. Before I bought a commuter bike a few months ago, I took the bus everywhere: to work, back home, etc. I barely drive my car (3 times per month max). I can manage to get everything I need without ever using a car. I don't mind driving, I just prefer not to spend money on gas and I have no qualms with public transportation. I think I also have to add that I live in one of the most bike-friendly cities in the nation.

After biking regularly for awhile, the idea of getting rid of my car started inching its way into my head. Pretty soon it consumed my every thought. My roommate doesn't have a car, and she's still alive - so that's mean everything will be ok, right?

I decided I would start looking into how to get rid of/sell my car. I paid my sister 5 years ago for her car. We never transferred the title, mostly because our family has too much other bull shit going on (or we're just lazy). I think I also need to mention how different my sister and I are. Black and white. Night and day. 32 (her)  and 25 (me). Accountant (her) and advertising agency copywriter (me).

As I started asking my sister to help me transfer the title, she asked questions about why I wanted to get rid of the car, why I would ever want to bike everywhere, and how I would ever be able to get to family events. After much back and forth and absolutely no understanding on her end, here is a snippet from a very long email that I now refer to as the ""Pontius pilate"" response:

""Long story short - I'm willing to transfer the title to you, even though I don't think you really own it outright. I think you're making a huge mistake, but I wash my hands of what you're going to move forward with.  It's your life, and you have to suffer with the consequences.  Not me.  Absolutely 100% do not count on me when you can't reserve your ""car-ride share"" to get you somewhere that your bike can't.""

My mother also thinks that I'm doing this as a way to distance myself from the family. The thing is, I'm absolutely not. I love my family, and even though they can get on my nerves, I would never miss a birthday, anniversary, wedding, or reunion. I even got a Zip car membership so I can drive 45 minutes back home if I ever needed to, just to appease my family. I even did this before they began voicing their disapproval/concerns.

I feel like I've tried telling them everything and they still don't understand or approve. Does anyone have anything I could say that would make them understand?

P.S. I just wiped out on gravel last week on a group ride. My arm and leg are pretty torn up, so for the moment I'm hiding from my family until I heal. I have a feeling that wouldn't help my case.",,False,self,t5_2tbmq,False,,,True,t3_1ihtg1,http://www.reddit.com/r/bikecommuting/comments/1ihtg1/thinking_about_selling_my_car_to_become_a/,

The original reason for buying the bike was that it would pay itself off by removing the cost of public transportation - now instead I find myself further in the hole.

Should I buy another bike of the same model since I know I like it and am used to it, or is that setting myself up for another disappointment?

My commute is only 5 miles.  I got my first roadbike in early 2010 and still hadn't gotten a flat (is that unusual? I've probably only put 2-3k miles on it) so I was probably due.  I've changed dozens of mountain bike tires in my life so I didn't really think it would be any different than a road bike.  I kept making stupid mistakes though.

It happened about a mile away from work.  I could have walked the rest of the way in about the same time it took me to fix it and ride the rest of the way.  But I decided to go ahead and put my spare on.

When I bought my bike I knew nothing about road bikes.  So I just told the guy at the bike store my budget and had them set me up.  Fortunately he knew what he was doing and got me a spare tube, two tire tools, and a compressed air cartridge.  I had read on here a few weeks ago that compressed air wasn't the way to go and I should carry a small pump instead.  It worked great, but I may get an air pump instead of replacing the cartridge.

My other tube might be fine, but I couldn't afford to try to air it up with the compressed air and be wrong so I went ahead and put on my spare.

It took me about 20 minutes to do it.  Kept changing how I was trying to get the tire back on.  When I finally figured out the 'smart' way it only took 3 or so minutes to finish up.

Keeping your shoes dry.,rockincooldude,26,2,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/bikecommuting/comments/1aouk6/a_quick_and_easy_tip_on_poor_weather_cycling/,"Hey everyone!  I did a quick search and didn't find anything like this posted here, so I figured it might help some of our budget-minded bike commuters.  I have been bike commuting for the better part of 6 years now starting out in Boston and now in central Maine.  Needless to say snow and especially snow/rain/mud/salt are all part of the game when mercury begins to rise.

I hear people ask rain gear questions all of the time and bike-specific gear is great at what it does, but for those that are on a budget or would like less gear to look after here is a simple solution to keeping your feet dry in crappy conditions. 

All it requires is:

-Step 1: [2 plastic grocery bags and 2 velcro straps](http://i.imgur.com/g5XtxDh.jpg)


-Step 2: Put each foot in each bag. 

-Step 3: [Once feet are in the bags ""roll"" the top over your foot, creating a foot-shaped barrier.](http://i.imgur.com/ngYYSmG.jpg)

-Step 4: [Hold a finger to the top of the bag on your foot and secure the velcro around your arch.  Done!](http://i.imgur.com/vUG9l6A.jpg)

If you have full cover fenders this works gloriously.  I currently run race-blade fenders which really don't protect the feet and have yet to have a soaked foot with this method in snow conditions.  In most rain conditions they have worked perfectly well, and have only somewhat failed (top of shoe wet) in torrential driving rain. 

There you go.  Easy, basically free, and one more use for those stupid plastic bags.  Rubber bands do also work in place of velcro, but they do not tend to last many rides and when they do fail the whole thing comes apart (not fun in the middle of a ride).  The velcro is much more reliable.

Keep riding!

I'm hoping you can give me some wisdom and help here. 

I ride to work, I work retail and our parking lot is a mess most of the time, but believe it or not, its become harder for me to find a parking spot than a place to park my bike. 

There are no racks, only some disabled parking signs (2, maybe 3 if I remember right). According to my boss we're not allowed to park our bikes on those because the facilities manager would ticket us since it obstructs acces (which it really doesn't, but whatever). I had been parking my bike on a railing by a garden, I would lift my bike over the plants to avoid damaging them. This railing is on the side of a bank in the lot, I've made friends with their parking enforcer and she had been keeping an eye on my bike. Recently I noticed the sprinkler was gushing water out (at 4am when I arrive), so I reported it to the manager at the bank. Next thing I know the manager has informed the parking enforcer that I can no longer park my bike by the railing because I probably broke the sprinkler. So now, I have nowhere to park my bike. My manager keeps suggesting some dinky  trees, but I live in LA where several trees have been cut down to steal bikes. According to my manager the facilites manager cannot install a bike rack anywhere, they've done the measurements. Today my manager ""jokingly"" said I couldn't work on a certain date because someone important was coming and my bike couldn't be parked just anywhere. I straight up told her that it was unfair that my hours would be cut solely based on the fact that I rode my bike to work. She said she was ""joking."" I was still very upset. So you see, this situation is escalating to ridiculous levels and I just want a damn pole to park my bike safely!

Are there any laws on my side? Do you have any suggestions? 

My current plan is to contact the facilities manager and kindly explain that I was the one that reported the sprinkler and I'm positive it was not me who broke it.

There are a lot of posts about different types of bikes, which bike to buy, etc., but they always seem to be about racers or hybrids. When I decided to use a cycling as my main method of getting around, it seemed natural to me to get a city bike - the type everybody uses in Amsterdam and Copenhagen.

This is my bike: http://www.bobbinbicycles.co.uk/bicycles/daytripper.html It's not perfect, but I love it.  Most importantly, I feel very secure because I sit quite high and have a good vantage point to observe the traffic around me. My only problem with it is that on the steepest of hills it would be good to have a lower gear (my home city of Reykjavík is quite hilly). Admittedly, my daily ride to work isn't a commute (it's 2km) but I use this as my primary means of transportation, wherever I need to go and whatever the weather, and it serves this purpose very well.

So I have two questions: 

1) Does anybody else on here use a city bike? 

2) And if not, why do you think that's the case? The only explanations I've been able to think of is that this sub is very US-focused and maybe there isn't a city bike culture there (I should note that that's the case in Iceland, these bikes are very new here) or that people think they don't work for longer distances.

I've been commuting ~20km round trip to work the past 2 months and am really enjoying it. It's something I plan on continuing (except for the winter -- snow and -30 C in Canada is no bueno for me) so I feel like I should get a decent bike.

I've just been using a $200 mountain bike I bought new about 4 years ago. It's nothing special, but gets me from point A to point B. The tires are rather fat and the handlebar keeps loosening every few days where I have to tighten them, but other than that, it does the trick.

While I would be willing to drop some cash for a good bike, I'm not sure I'm well-off enough to justify spending the cash without noticing a significant improvement. My max budget would likely be around $800. Based on that, do you think I would notice a significant performance difference between the bikes or should I keep rockin' my current setup? Thanks.

**EDIT:** Thank you all so much for the replies!! It was a tough decision to make, but I decided to retire my bike last night and went and bought a GT Traffic 2.0 Road Bike. It wasn't my first choice, but it was 25% off and a family member who is a regular at the bike shop gave me a 50% off certificate so I only ended up paying $320 CDN. Tried it out this morning and loved it. I have a 10km commute to work and I shaved about 2-3 minutes off my time. More importantly, I felt much more safe in the back of my mind...I didn't have to worry about my chain getting stuck once a day or my handlebars becoming unsafely loose. Overall, I am happy with my decision and I hope this bike holds up for a few years.

1372352489.0,26,self.bikecommuting,1h6svp,"For those who wear street shoes for cycling, the flip-pedal and half-clip may be a great alternative to clipless pedals.",Askii,29,3,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/bikecommuting/comments/1h6svp/for_those_who_wear_street_shoes_for_cycling_the/,"I wear street shoes for cycling in the city, since I'll be wearing them at my destinations. I'm quite happy with the pedals and half-clips I've added to my old '70s road bike, which allow me to wear anything from runners to dress shoes to boots and still get some security on the pedal and make use of the full pedaling circle.

The [MKS Urban Platform](http://www.discountcyclesdirect.co.uk/images/mks_urban_platform_pedals.jpg) pedal has a tab that flips the pedal into position when you step on it. With a clip attached, the pedal hangs in ideal position for the tab to work. It has greatly reduced fumbling around at intersections; about 90-95% of the time I can ""clip in"" instantaneously. The other 5-10% of searching for the pedal platform happens when the pedal is swinging about so my foot can't immediately find the tab. I'm hoping that practice, and remembering to still the pedal when I stop at an intersection, will raise the positive clip-in to 100%.

The [MKS Deep Half-Clip](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41EsZTKOU6L.jpg) is fantastic! I never used toe clip straps anyway, but the greater clearance compared to a full clip allows my feet to sink into the pedal and clip right away. It offers all the security and leverage I could want, short of a clipless pedal. Other versions are the [Velo Orange Deep Half-Clip](http://www.bmtbonline.com/WebRoot/Store10/Shops/61513316/4D32/9785/334C/BC80/A5A6/C0A8/28B9/F104/Half_clips_web.jpg) and old-school [tubular strapless clips](http://brucegordoncycles.bigcartel.com/product/stainless-strapless-clips). (I seem to recall reading that the Velo Orange clips butted up flush with the edge of the pedal, if that's important to you.) White Industries also makes a [tabbed platform pedal,](http://bikereviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/white-industries-urban-platform-pedals.jpeg) which is a replica of a much more expensive French piece that has been around for many decades.

Some half-clips, including the MKS, come in a [leather-covered option](http://www.wigglestatic.com/images/Half-clip-brown-leather-zoom.jpg) to protect the toes of your shoes. I've shied away from the leather because my crank arms are long enough to cause my clips to occasionally scrape the ground when I've dismounted; but now I'm thinking of [adding the leather](http://store.velo-orange.com/index.php/toe-clip-leathers.html): better to scrape the leather [on my clips](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cCykr8VNBJc/UH87lcrzROI/AAAAAAAAIok/IIp97qzKauo/s640/urban+pedal+002.JPG) than scrape the toes of my expensive dress shoes.

One disadvantage to the toe clips: I have to remove them when I clean my chain, because they prevent me from turning the pedals freely if my bike is just standing on the ground.

I have been bike commuting to work for 4 years now.  My bike of choice is a Cannondale F7 MTB with road wheels on it (I have 2 sets of wheels and I swap in the MTB wheels when I take it off road).  Right now my commute is only 4 miles each way.

Well I just bought a new place, but it is much farther away.  Just doing an initial google maps biking directions, it looks like the ride would be 27 miles.  I would be willing to buy a new road bike to be more efficient if I were to take this commute up.

My question is:  Are there many people commuting this long of a distance?  How is it on your body?  How long does it take you?  What are your eating habits like because of it?

I am going to do an experimental ride next weekend to just see how long it takes, but I am looking to see if there are any people around that have experience with that type of commute.

I was in the process of changing my stock Cross Check, which I've had for about 3 years now, into a city bike when the ""[City bikes, anyone?](http://www.reddit.com/r/bikecommuting/comments/11b2fb/city_bikes_anyone/)"" thread popped up. Since then I've mostly finished the CC and have been using it on my daily commute. 


 

**Drive Train**

The biggest change was changing the drive train to an IGH 8 speed Shimano Alfine hub. I really like it--it's incredibly smooth. Those of you who have ridden a fixed gear or single speed would find this pretty similar, except you get gears! 

**Bar Setup**

The next major change in the bike was the handlebar setup. Switching to [Civia Dupont](http://www.civiacycles.com/components/dupont_handlebar/) bars took this from a cross/road bike to a real townie feel. So far I love the upright riding position and I don't feel slower on this bike for normal riding. I can't do an all-out sprint and get into the drops like I could before, but I don't miss that.

**Grips and Shifter**

I wanted this bike to look good as well as be functional, so I went with the [City Grips from Walnut Studiolo](http://walnutstudiolo.com/products/city-grips). I of course had to complicate things since I'm running a [Jtek bar-end shifter](http://jtekengineering.com/barendshifter.php) (I think this is the only bar-end shifter that works with IGHs), so Walnut made me a custom right grip 1/4"" wider than the left so I could run my cable/housing under the grip. He charged me $6 more, but it's definitely worth it. 

*Note about the shifter:* Jtek only has black listed on their site, but they actually have sliver available if you email to ask about it. I didn't realize this until after I already had the black one, but they were nice about swapping it out. 

**Fenders and Rack**

[Velo Orange Steel Fenders](http://store.velo-orange.com/index.php/accessories/fenders/fender-sets/vo-45mm-stainless-fenders-700c.html) - $55 for steel fenders is very reasonable, and these things wrap way around the wheels so there is minimal spray. Plus shiny. 

[Dajia Steel Rack](http://store.velo-orange.com/index.php/dajia-stainless-steel-rear-expedition-rack.html) - Awesome rack and really good price for a good looking steel rack. I looked at Tubus and Nitto but couldn't justify their prices. 

**Misc**

I also put a [chain guard](http://store.velo-orange.com/index.php/accessories/chainguards-stay-protectors-kickstands/vo-alloy-chainguard.html) (also VO) on there partially for looks, but it's actually really nice not having to worry about pants getting caught in the chain, or just rubbing on it and getting dirty. 

I'm running [All City 612 Cranks](http://allcitycycles.com/products/612_track_cranks) with [Crank Brothers Mallet2 Pedals](http://www.crankbrothers.com/pedals_mallet2.php).

**Thoughts**

I love it! I'll probably put a front basket style rack on this bike pretty soon, and wire it up with a dyno hub and lights eventually. Oh and I want to put a black Brooks saddle on there, but I ran through my bike spending budget for the time being.

* First time sub-freezing (30 degrees this morning).
* First time on my singlespeed [*].
* First time to our other office, through heavy traffic (and no bike rack at that office, grrr).
* First time to an office with no shower.

I know this stuff is no big deal to the ""real"" commuters, but I'm pretty excited. I feel like I'm at that tipping point where riding to work is the default unless I have to drive, rather than just something I do some of the time.

I've been surprised that the cold isn't nearly as uncomfortable as I feared it would be. 30 is really not a big deal at all. When it gets to 20 I'll probably have to get a warmer pair of gloves.

I just got a trek 7.4 fx and its been great. 

Have fenders, rack and pannier and I decided to upgrade my shoes and pedals. I bought pedals that clip in on one side, while the other side remains normal. You can still wear shoes. And bought some bike shoes. 

Played around with it for a while. Rode around the block a couple of times and thought i felt comfortable with the unclipping motion. So i buy them and bike home. I decide to wear the shoes home. Two blocks later a bus hit me while it was turning. Classic mistake.  Bus was making a right turn into me. 

It sends me off balance and in my panic I couldn't unclip! I fell over on the ground and the bus just continued to run over my bike.  I was still clipped in! It ran over the back of my bike and crushed my rear fender and rack. It never stopped. Just kept going. 

I'm not scared of riding or anything. Though it was scary.  I feel like i just need some advice about bike shoes and pedals. 

I went back to store and had the bike checked out. Its ok. 

I'm not even sure what i need from you guys. I just thought this story would be interesting. Also I've been lurking for too long.

**White cars** 

* +1pt for expensive white cars,

**4x4s**

Therefore an old Clio with body kit and a dint in the bumper would be 2pts (Not an immediate wanker hazard but something to keep my eye on).  A white Bentley with a custom number plate would be 3pts, but if said vehicle is an Audi, that would multiply to 6pts (Immediate wanker hazard).

I don't think I realized how much I would have to do to prepare for this.

In the last two days...

-Researched the heck out of bikes and gear.

-Went with my parents to buy said bike and gear (birthday present for me). Took a good 4 hours or so, not including my hour drive back home to the LBS they wanted to buy the bike from. They had to get the fenders and rack on the bike which took a while.

-Had to take the wheels off my bike to fit it in my tiny car for the ride back.

-Puzzled for a significant amount of time (like, hours of fiddling and research) how to get the wheels back on, the chain on the gears, and the brakes back in place. Cried a little.

And I thought I was done and all set to commute in late May. And then I took her out for a spin... Just a mile out and a mile back.

My butt is so sore, and I am not entirely certain that my legs have not actually turned into Jelly. I think I need to practice a lot over the next month.

I am also trying to find a way of covering my butt during my ride. I thought wearing a belt would be enough. But judging from the amount of breeze I was feeling, I believe I was mistaken.

TL;DR Getting my bike bought and set up took way longer than expected, plus I need lots of practice before I actually start commuting every day.

The question is, if you can't bring your bike up in your flat everyday. How do you keep it safe from ~~dickheads~~ people with ill intentions who just like to break other people's stuff?!

I've got a Dutch city bike (a classic Gazelle opafiets) and live in a 4th floor appartment with no lift and really no space for a bike. 

The bike itself is sturdy but things like cables to drumbrakes or in-hub gears are easily damaged with some bad intentions.

Now for that beer...

EDIT: Thank you everyone for your answers. We are definitely considering making space for the bikes and keeping them indoors now. I guess after about a week or two of bringing it up and down it will become a lot easier to navigate the stairs... hopefully!

I currently drive to work most days, but the cost of the car/gas is hard for me to accept. I also miss feeling connected to the outside world the way I did when I walked/bused my way around.

So now I'm seriously considering biking my commute. It's 11 miles, most of it on a dedicated bike path so I don't have to deal too much with cars. I also have a very flexible work schedule and my employer will reimburse most of the cost of a bike and pay for annual tune-ups. There are also showers and lockers available. It seems too perfect not to try, even though I worry that it's too far for me to bike regularly.

I do own a bike now, but tried bicycling my commute once last summer and it nearly did me in! I was so exhausted and sore afterwards and felt like I spent most of my ride fighting with my bike to shift correctly. It's a 20+ year old freebie that I think is probably too small for me. I grew up biking around my neighborhood, but I don't really know anything about serious bike commuting and I'm not sure what bike is the right one for me.

So, here's my info:
-Female, 5'9"" with a 33-34"" inseam
-Chronic shoulder/neck pain and wrist issues tells me a should probably get a hybrid or something with a more upright posture
-I live in Seattle, so rain is constant (fenders and disk brakes?)
-The commute has some pretty long climbs

What else can you tell me? I would like to put a rack on it because I don't want to carry my work clothes and laptop on my back. I don't want to spend too much, but enough that I'll get a quality bike that will serve me well.

Also, do you have any tips for working my way up to biking every day?

I've ridden to work every day since October and I love being outdoors (even in craptastic weather), I love the exercise, it saves me time, I wouldn't trade it for anything.

That said, my original motivation for commuting by bike was to save money - if I wasn't biking, I'd be buying an $80 monthly public transportation pass.

I had a road bike already but didn't want to lock it on the sidewalk and leave it all day, so I bought a $60 rust bucket cruiser. I needed a helmet, a lock, all that beginner stuff. I've had a couple flat tires that punched right through the tire, so over the months I've needed to buy new tires (finally invested in some Hard Cases, so hopefully that will stop). And of course, once I started biking I wanted better gear... I got an Osprey Momentum backpack for Christmas (which was great because that would've cost me quite a bit on my own) and bought fenders for the road bike.

Anyway, I just added up my expenses and **so far I've spent $470 on my bike**, bike gear, etc. **I would've spent $560 on public transportation passes** in that same time period. The thing is, though, that I still have to ride public transport sometimes, which I pay for per ride, so I'm probably just barely breaking even. I thought it was interesting and a little surprising to calculate what I've actually spent on this little hobby so far.

A couple caveats: As I said above, I love commuting by bike and it's worth it for the enjoyment I get alone. Also, it could certainly be done cheaper - I buy gear that is nice to have but that I don't really need, and sometimes if I'm bringing my wheel in to get a new tire, I'll just pay to have the bike shop guys install it rather than doing it myself. And a lot of the stuff I've bought - U-lock, fenders for the road bike, etc. - is a one-time purchase that I can hopefully use for years, so my future costs will hopefully go down.

I'm just curious what the experience of other bike commuters has been. Does biking to work save you money? Was that even your motivation in the first place?

**Edit: To clarify, I know that most of my expenses so far are one-time costs and that over time, I will save more and more money. I shared my own spending to provide an explanation of the types of things I'm spending on, not because I'm worried about it.**

**I thought it was interesting, though, that the initial costs are so high. Since in my case the alternative, public transportation, is relatively cheap, it will take a while to really start saving money. I'm curious about whether others have had the same experience and whether anyone else has kept track of how much they've spent on bike commuting.**",,False,self,t5_2tbmq,1367595197.0,,,True,t3_1dma4s,http://www.reddit.com/r/bikecommuting/comments/1dma4s/do_you_think_commuting_by_bike_is_saving_you_money/,

OK, so then I went on Ebay and as the stars seem to align for me, I found someone that had a matching bag that was listed as a backpack without straps. OK, these bags retail for nearly $300 and I snapped up the black one for $5 because it was mis-listed. Then I scrounged around for the fenders, the bar ends and the lights out of my pile of bike stuff. I paid retail for the Ergon grips, which were a very nice upgrade, I highly recommend them. I had to buy a rear rack, but instead of plunking down the $100 for the Jannd one, I took some solid measurements and found that this Topeak one is perfect.

So, I've just been hired for a new job and moved to a biker friendly city. I spent the last 2 weeks stalking craiglist and local bike shops for a nice, used road bike. I finally found a [2012 Lexa Trek](http://www.trekbikes.com/us/en/bikes/road/sport/lexa/lexa_compact/) that has only been used as a demo at the local Trek dealer! (: I'm very excited. I'm picking it up tomorrow afternoon. I'm also looking to put [these Shimano SPDs](http://www.merlincycles.com/bike-shop/mtb-parts/transmission-gears/pedals-mtb/shimano-pedals/shimano-m520-spd-pedals.html?utm_campaign=googlebase-US&amp;utm_source=googlebase&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_term=Shimano+Pedals) on... What do you guys think?

I've been doing my 10-12 miles (depending on which side streets I take) commute on my old mountain bike from when I was 15... Yikes! I'm very excited to get on my nice new road bike.

I'm a girl (if you couldn't tell from the Lexa), and my question for the gals who commute is this - how do you fix your hair and then wear a helmet? How is it wearable after 5.5 miles of biking? I'm a big fan of curling my hair, but I've just been wearing it straight and long lately. ): Sad day.

So, advice for a new commuter appreciated, hair tips from those of you with flowing locks, and a general hello from me!

edit: Oh, one more question I had that I wanted to ask - I don't have shower access at my work quite yet... Any tips/tricks so that I don't smell all day? I sweat like a man.

---

Also, I figured out how to bike my 5 miles with previously curled hair! I thought I'd post for any future searchers.

My hair is so so fine-stranded that the pin curling crimps and dents my hair. I've tried other no heat methods which run into various sorts of problems due to the fineness of my hair. But, I can curl my hair with [these](http://www.sallybeauty.com/flexible-rods/HAIRAR4,default,pd.html) the night before. I take them out the next morning and without unraveling each rod's section, twist and pin the curled sections together to hold their shape under a helmet. I free them when I get to work; I've had mild success with this method! It's not long enough to crimp and since I can free the larger chunks of curl into waves at work, the style has some wind forgiveness.

Rain proof is desirable, rain resistance is mandatory as it's rained at least once a week since bike season began. I'll be carrying lunch, general purse items and my bike gear (tool, spare tube, lock etc). I've successfully avoided the need to carry a laptop so far and don't see that as a consideration. I do like to stop and pick up a few things on the way home.


I'm a girl in a professional role. Our dress code is on the formal side of office casual and I typically wear a dress. I don't have gym, shower or private washroom facilities available, my commute is relatively short and typically just wear leggings under my dress to work.

I'm passed regularly by people commuting on road bikes (some are wearing backpacks, some have racks). Basically, I think that for the type of riding that I do, a heavily built commuter is the wrong choice. 

Would I gain much speed with a road bike (or perhaps a steel bike like a Surly LHT) that's also laden down with fenders and a rack? Thoughts on prioritizing speed over disks, racks and IGHs?

It all happened really fast, so I'm not sure how long the cab had been there or what. This was in Manhattan, going south on 2nd Ave, which has a bicycle lane to the far left. The cab pulled over right next to the bike lane. Luckily he was wearing his helmet as usual and didn't break anything, just some pretty bad bruises, a broken brake lever, and a bent front wheel. The passenger was very apologetic (strangely, she kept offering a drink, of all things), but I wasn't thinking so I didn't ask to exchange information. By the time I looked up, the cab driver was gone. My friend waited 2 hours for the police to arrive, only to be told that it was not the cab's fault at all and, if anyone is to blame, it's either the passenger or my friend's fault. The cops ended up interrogating him, asking if he ran lights, etc, making him feel like the guilty one. In the end they didn't do the report. They seemed to think it was too much trouble for nothing. My friend then chatted with another cop on the train, who told him to report it at a precinct. He went to the nearest one, and they did not take any information from him and instead gave him a civilian incident report to fill out. It seems like bikers here have almost no rights, even when riding in the bike lane.  

My thinking is that the cab should either pull over all the way onto the bike lane or pull over so that when the passenger opens the door, it doesn't open into the bike lane. But at the same time, we should always watch out for parked cars.  

I don't know, what do you think? Any thoughts, info, resources would be great. Sadly, it's this kind of crap is what makes people not want to bike ever again. 

Edit: Thanks for all your suggestions! I also found this very useful: http://www.transalt.org/files/newsroom/magazine/981JanFeb/doored.html

If anyone has any other favorites, sound off.

Paul Dorn's Bike Commuting 101 - Still the best single resource I've seen for what you need to know going in.

http://www.runmuki.com/commute/

FAQ: Why Do You Ride Like That - Includes a nice semi-interactive animation showing why you should insist on taking the lane, an often counter-intuitive safety measure for beginners.

http://cyclingsavvy.org/hows-my-driving/

Commute Orlando - Pretty much everything on this site is a great read for any American bike user, and from what I've seen a lot of it is applicable to other countries as well. Good thoughts on how to view use of the road, sharrows, being a courteous road citizen, and more.

http://commuteorlando.com/wordpress/on-the-road/

And, the ever prevalent tire inflation question. I've seen several studies showing that optimum tire inflation for road use is a lot more complex than the ""high PSI"" often answered on r/bicycling, and requires knowing your tire width and weight load and distribution to answer honestly. This site provides a link to the article on why, and a spreadsheet that makes calculating your own ideal PSIs easy-peasy.

I have been commuting regularly since last September and have really loved it. I use an el cheapo department store bike so that in the event it gets stolen or wrecked, I won't be out much cash. 

Recently we opened a second store in my community so now I have two different commutes and at different hours depending on scheduling. One store is about 2mi from the house and the other is about 5mi away, so they are booth short commutes.

Our new store is open until 9:00pm so I am often leaving there around 9:30 on the bike, when it is dark out and am wondering what other who commute at night Re finding works best for visibility.

I have a small headlight, which I found out isn't quite bright enough for me and can easily be over-ridden. I'm happy with my tail light that has 5LEDs and 5 different modes of operation.

I'd really like some eyewear for night riding though as I wear contacts and they seem to ""glaze over"" sometimes in windy conditions.

I also plan to get some new tires soon with reflective sidewalls.

Are there any other suggestions to help make my night time commuting safer for myself as well as other traffic?

No major injuries except for some banged up and bloody knees and hands (and some very bruised pride). And once I'd put my chain back on and straightened my derailleur my bike was good to ride home.

It was heavy as hell, empty it probably weighed 5 pounds. It was also a huge pain in the ass to get into the main compartment.  You have to un-velcro a flap, unroll it like 10 inches then un-velcro the main compartment.  Then any clothes you pull out will be sticking on the velcro, then you have to reverse all that stuff to close it back up.  


I commute on a full suspension mountain bike with semi-slick tires.  I enjoy jumping over curbs and medians like a lunatic. When I ride trails on the weekends I switch the tires out for knobby ones (or just ride the slicks hah).

So here's my wishlist in order of importance:

-Waterproof top and bottom.  I liked the looks of the timbuk 2 swig but I do not believe the bottom is waterproof only the flap that goes over the top.

-Durable

-Lightweight

-Good Ventilation

-No hip belt or at least removable / hide-able hip belt  Yes I'm sure they are amazingly useful but they really bother me.  Sometimes I wear a motocross chest protector when I ride and having that thing getting pushed up by a hip belt is a real pain.  Maybe I can just tie the hip straps up with wire ties or something.

-Water reservoir? I never had one of these but I guess it could be handy. 

I'm thinking about the deuter race exp air with the rain cover. Any comments?  Does this come with the bladder or is that separate?

Here are some considerations I'm looking at for this venture, because honestly I have no idea what pannier I should select.

I have to change at work into anywhere from one additional to three additional outfits per day. The outfits are shorts/t-shirt/running shoes, boots/trousers/coat, and maybe an additional set of gym clothes. I also bring a towel, flip flops, and hygeine equipment to shower with. I'd also like space to store both breakfast and lunch. All of my clothes would weigh in at approximately 12 pounds. My boots are the largest of the items I have, but my uniforms are not small either. 

Presently, I can fit all of my essential items in [this](https://www.oakleysi.com/Product_Detail.cfm?id=676&amp;sid=52&amp;pid=6) bag. 

I would like my panniers to be waterproof, in the event of inclement weather.

The way there is downhill, the way back is uphill. I ride in most weather conditions, except for cold weather rain/icy roads. I will ride in snow within reason. Commuting to/from work is main use of my bike. I'd say about once a season I'll just ride for funsies. I bring my bike into my office building, since that's the safest place to keep it.

The following is a list of what I bought/use. I realize not everything is still sold on Amazon, but at least you can get an idea of what to look our for.

**[EDIT]** This is a list of things I've acquired over the last 4 years, for two different bikes. They're not all ""necessary"" for my commute, but damn it I want to be comfortable when I ride all year round!  Haha, also, some of them are just kind of cool. If you find that any of these items are not necessary, cool, then don't buy them. I only created this list as to be a guide for others when choosing accessories to help with one's commute. Additionally, I do not carry all of these things at the same time, or any of the time. **[/EDIT]**


[**Chain Lube**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015FI8AS/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) - Just spray it on while rotating gears backwards (or forwards if you have it upside or on a stand w/e).  This is the single most effective DIY maintenance product I have bought. I can't hear my bike at all when I ride. It's definitely worth it!


[**Silk Glove Liners**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V5DB1E/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) - When your gloves won't cut it, or the weather is too hot for winter, but too cold for fingerless-only. They cheap enough that I buy a new pair every year since they get holes pretty easily.

[**Steel Cable; no lock**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BD8IQ4/ref=oh_details_o05_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) - If you already have a lock, this is a good cheap solution. 


[**This is some heavy duty chain/lock**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XTPO2M/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)  I don't use this often but it's a solid lock. 

[**Kickstand**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001NDYOK/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) - I got this since my bike didn't come with one. It was a little annoying to put on, it's not the best out there, but for that price I couldn't resist. It does the job, that's all that I care about.

[**Blinking red-light thingy**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RYAKHC/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) - Batteries last long. I have it clipped to my backpack.

[**All-in-one toolkit for roadside maintenance**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001B1638/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) - Has the basics. I used it a few times to adjust my brakes after I got a crappy tune-up.

[**U-Lock and cable**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004C94T84/ref=oh_details_o05_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) - A bit more expensive, I know, but it is the perfect combo. Every time I ask a cycling nerd what the best lock is, they'll say U-Locks. They restrict leverage, and usually have an anti-drill mechanism built-in the keyhole.

[**Padded under-shorts**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QYXAVE/ref=oh_details_o06_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) - Protect that grundle! Although, I don't use it much since my bike seat is pretty good and my body is used to the constant friction now. But those first couple of months, these were life savers.

[**One of those entire-head thingies**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012TWSSA/ref=oh_details_o01_s01_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) - Because fuck the cold!

[**Battery heated jacket!!!**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048EJXJS/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) - If you have the dough, this is totally worth it. Best damn jacket I have ever worn, even without the battery-heat. Like today, I ride in below-freezing weather, and this baby keeps me feeling warm. Totally worth it.

[**Rain boot covers**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00171KGEG/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) - For those summer days of 90 degrees and rain, but you hate driving to work.

[**Velcro Reflectors**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q6D5XW/ref=oh_details_o05_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) - Be seen at night and keep pants from getting gear/chain crap on them.

[**Padded Under wear**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012HN55M/ref=oh_details_o06_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) - Dudes - keep 'em safe, keep 'em warm.

[**Side Mirror**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009R96YK/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) - Save my life so many times.

[**Blinking light**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HU11ZG/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i02?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) - Batteries last long, does the job.

[**Winter Half-mask**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018BJSQC/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i01?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) - Light but effective.  Not as good as the full head thing.

[**Light jacket**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G0N8RK/ref=oh_details_o05_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) - Perfect for spring/fall. It was a bit pricey, but worth it.

[**Bike bag**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FIAU2U/ref=oh_details_o06_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) - Holds quite a bit. Nalgene + tools.

[**Lock cable**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00165P50S/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) - I use this the most since it's convenient.

When my bike is loaded (such as today when I had 121 exams in my milk crate) I find the kickstand very unreliable, as my bike shifts and threatens to topple over if I leave it (even for a second to open the garage).  I use one like [this](http://www.rei.com/product/612109/greenfield-kickstand), just your old traditional kickstand that was on your bike as a kid.

I've already lost weight and feel more energetic, plus I'm saving money.  The bike I'm using is one I bought a few years ago from a national bike chain (Performance Bikes?) for around $280.  I don't even know the brand and I ride it everyday (I think it is a new style Schwin (not the classic style)).

When my rear tire failed (spokes broke), probably due to my fat ass, I took it to a different, local bike shop and had the wheel replaced.  The guy there said my bike was okay for occasional fun, but was also recommending I upgrade to something better for more regular riding.  I'm sure he wants to sell bikes, but he wasn't pushy, let me browse and think about things for awhile, and even test ride them when I come back.

I have zero brand loyalty and truth be told, I don't even know why bikes cost thousands of dollars.  How complicated can 2 wheels and a frame be?  Obviously, I'm missing something in my knowledge.  I'm sure professional riders get extra performance out of them, just like professional swimmers shave their body hair for fractional gains, but would a fat guy like me even notice a difference between an $800 bike and a $4000 bike?  Granted, I'm definitely not spending that kind of money, so don't worry.  I really don't want to spend more than $5-800 and even less if I can get away with it, but I want something reliable (especially the wheels and tires), quality made (which I understand usually costs more) and I don't want to bend over with the curly handles.  I have full, bright, safety gear, and lights and drive like a car, following all car rules (sometimes the stop light doesn't change, though).  Here are some models I've been looking at:

Giant Rapid 3  http://www.giant-bicycles.com/en-us/bikes/model/rapid.3/11499/55825/  $680 at local shop

Breezer Downtown 8  http://www.breezerbikes.com/bikes/details/downtown_8_us  $699

I know the drop bars are there to steady and steer the bike, but since the first day I got on a bike with drop bars, I've used the hoods (and the flat area towards the center when relaxing on long flat roads). I try to go as fast as I can most of the time to keep up with cars, and I know your cycling posture has to do with not only ergonomics but also speed. So I've been trying to use the lower parts of the bars, but they don't feel comfortable. I feel like my hands are slipping downwards off them. The top of my bars are level, with my brake/shifter hoods on a slight up angle, so I don't think the bars are rotated up in the front. It just feels like they ought to be longer, or something. I try not to support myself with the bars, ever, but leaning over that far I feel like I've got to be.

1345106522.0,15,self.bikecommuting,yb8g1,Polite motorists sometimes causing trouble. (X-post /r/bicycling),ZanzaraEE,19,4,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/bikecommuting/comments/yb8g1/polite_motorists_sometimes_causing_trouble_xpost/,"I'd would like to speak out against motorists wrongfully yielding right-of-way to cyclists when the cyclists are proceeding straight across a busy road. [IMAGE](http://i.imgur.com/HyiqE.jpg). This often leads to an ""annoying situation"" that I have described below. I also have described two ""dangerous situations"" that I have been a part of as a result of this wrongful yielding.

**Annoying situation**

Again, the situation is best described by referring to the ""IMAGE"" above. I'll refer to this image for the rest of this post. (Sorry to all the ""Drives on the left"" people.)

Anyway. Sometimes when the cyclist is waiting for a safe time to proceed, a courteous motorist (we'll say a motorist in lane 2) will stop to allow the cyclist to proceed. Sometimes this can lead to a lot of time wasting for motorists. 

Why? As a cyclist, I still have to yield to motorists in lanes 3 and 4 (and 1). I'm not going to proceed until I'm sure they will stop. So, I will wait until any cars in lanes 3 and 4 have stopped. **Most of the time** these motorists will stop (even though they don't have to); then I will proceed. This usually takes 10 or so seconds. All the while the motorist in lane 2 is sitting there and more cars are piling behind them. So, the motorist in lane 2 causes a long delay for themselves, the cars behind them, and the cars in lanes 3 and 4. It always seems like less of a delay would have occurred for everyone (on average) had no one wrongfully yielded to me.

**Dangerous situation 1**

Once I was in a situation as follows: a car stopped for me in lane 1. I saw a car coming from behind it in lane 2, and I waited to see ensure it would stop. The car in lane 1 started honking for me to proceed. As they were doing this, the car in lane 2 flew past at full speed. I'm not sure if the driver of car 2 knew why car 1 was stopped, but had I proceeded, I would be in danger of being hit. (Side note, it is heavily emphasized in drivers' ed courses to never pass a car stopped at a crosswalk until you know why they are stopped.)

**Dangerous situation 2**

A car in lane 2 wrongfully yielded; this car was going straight. Also, a car was in lane 3 turning left. Neither would proceed because I was there (note, the car in lane 3 had to yield to the car in lane 2 anyway, making the situation even more awkward). I started proceeding across the intersection. Along the way I had to stop as a bus was heading through the intersection in lane 4. I'm not sure if the bus driver saw me over top of the car in lane 3 (it was a pickup truck), so had I not stopped, I would have been in danger of being struck by that bus. I think the bus driver could see only that the person in lane 3 was turning left, not that they were (wrongly) yielding to a cyclist.

**In conclusion,** has anyone experienced a similar situation? Am I right in saying that motorists shouldn't do this? I'd rather not be a douche and force people to take the right-of-way by refusing to proceed and waving them though, but there often seems to be ugly situations when I proceed. Any advice or thoughts?

* **My hints for cyclists:** Be very careful when a car wrongfully yields to you.

* **My hints for motorists:** Do not wrongfully yield to a cyclist to be polite, unless they are waiting at a crosswalk (which they shouldn't be). Be very cautious when passing a stopped car at an intersection/crosswalk until you know why they are stopped.

PS: To the motorists who do stop wrongfully: Thanks for watching out for cyclists and being polite, just be aware that you may inadvertently put cyclists in a dangerous situation.

The horn blast was pretty threatening, and made me doubt my decision to take the lane.

Since I neither want to be passed unsafely nor be threatened by impatient drivers from behind, I'm wondering if a [side flag](http://www.nordicgroup.us/s78/images/img_0277.jpg) would be a good alternative.

First-time poster with a rather extensive question (sorry!). I live in the Washington, DC area and am about to start a new job next week. I'd like to bike to work, as this is the first time I'll be able to, but am unsure how to go about making sure I've got the right gear (namely- my bike).

My commute 17 miles each way but completely on bike trails, minus a jaunt across a bridge. I'll be doing this route 3x/week (Tues/Wed/Thurs) as it's a part-time job. It's a mostly flat ride, but the last 6 miles to work are uphill at a constant 3% grade.

I currently have two bikes: my dad's rather old Trek Mountain bike which I haven't ridden in close to 3 years- mostly because it weighs a ton and I have a better bike to ride. I also have a Trek Madone 2.1 road bike that I ride on weekends.

I know there are bike locks in the garage at work, however my company said I could keep the bike in one of their many conference rooms (which I plan on doing). Therefore I'm less concerned about bike safety and more concerned about having a good, sturdy, reliable bike for commuting (and probably some grocery shopping too). I also want the bike to withstand rain and snow so I can bike in all-seasons. I once got caught on an unmelted snowy path on my road bike and it didn't end well.

As my commute is long, and I know I'll need fenders and probably a rack for panniers to carry work clothes and my lunch (plus spare tubes, tool kit, etc) I'm not sure the road bike would suffice (can you even fit a rack and fenders on a road bike?), and I have a feeling the mountain bike would be unbearable on a ride that long with the weight on the back-end. I once had a rack and panniers on my bike and it was borderline un-liftable.

Any suggestions on bikes? Should I try out the mountain or the road bike for a while? If so- what should I do to make them commutable? I don't want to spend $1,000 on a new bike (500-600 would probably be okay), but I worry spending $200 on a shitty bike with 7 speeds wouldn't be adequate for a long commute, and I definitely want clipless pedals for the ride. 

I've never commuted to work before so I've basically got no idea what I'm doing- please help!

If my age/gender are of any importance to answering the question- 27, female. Plus- if there are any DC commuters here- I'll be using Four Mile Run, the Mt Vernon Trail, Rock Creek Park trail and the Capital Crescent Trail to get to work and back

I've decided that I would like to commute by bike for my last year at school. I start in 11 days so I've got until then to prepare. I need some tips on clothing, storage, bike locks, etc.

I've got two routes - one is six miles and takes me along dual carriageways (which I'm completely fine with). The other is seven miles  but it takes me along a cycle path which is completely seperated from the road.

I've found that cycling in the clothes that I'll be wearing for the rest of the day isn't an option because I get hot quickly and then I end up sweaty. Lycra is also out of the equation cause, you know, I'm not going to turn up to school in it. I was thinking that a [loose fit jersey](http://www.tredz.co.uk/.Outeredge-Kobe-Short-Sleeve-Loose-Fit-Road---MTB-Mountain-Bike---Cycling-Jersey_27196.htm) and [padded MTB shorts](http://www.tredz.co.uk/.Endura-Hummvee-Baggy-Cycling-Shorts_15178.htm?utm_source=Google&amp;utm_medium=AdwordsProductAds&amp;utm_campaign=Adwords&amp;gclid=CPG326b0r7cCFUzHtAodHHcATA) are the way forward.

This raises another question, what do I carry my clothes in? Along with my books, my backpack gets pretty heavy and uncomfortable. Is there another option except going for full on panniers?

And finally, what is a decent u-lock and flex cable combo? I've got a cheap cable lock right now which is decent for locking my bike up for five minutes, I certainly won't be using it to lock my bike up for six hours though!

In preparation, I was going over my route so I wouldn't be surprised by anything, and I noticed a situation that I'm unsure about the proper way to handle.

In San Diego, there is only really one practical north and southbound bike route between the areas I need to traverse.  This causes me to have to use [Kearny Villa Rd](https://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;ll=32.854927,-117.119027&amp;spn=0.00607,0.009715&amp;t=h&amp;z=18), which has freeway style on/off ramps where it intersects with Hwy 163.  So you have to negotiate traffic on the current road that's going anywhere between 50-65mph and traffic coming off the freeway itself at the same speeds.  Actually the whole road seems ridiculously dangerous as you basically only have a few feet and a white line separating you and traffic rumbling along at near 70mph... but that's not the point of this post.

Am I suppose to signal into and control/share the right through lane prior to the off/on ramps like I normally would here until it's practical to get back into the bike lane?  That seems fairly dangerous with traffic moving at this speed.

I'm most interested in:

-How long your commute is

-What the terrain's like

-What traffic conditions are like

-Any other uses you have for the bike in question



Your setup:

-Type of handle bars

-Type of pedals

-Kind of gearing 



The bicycling population on here seems pretty diverse in terms of their location throughout the US (and the world). I think it'd be interesting to see how this relates to the type of bike they ride.












EDIT: Thanks for the input guys, very interesting. The stats I collected before I got tired:

*Distance*

30 miles: 1

25 miles: 1

20 miles: 4

15 miles: 4

10 miles: 3

5 miles: 3


*Handlebar Position*

Dropped: 8

Upright: 9

On my road biking over the last few years, I've generally stuck to lower traffic roads away from population on 30-50 mile rides.  On my bike commuting over the last few months, however, I haven't had that option, since I actually have a destination.  Between reading about proper behavior and common sense, I've become pretty comfortable and predictable in traffic and usually don't have a problem.

One situation, however, that I still don't quite understand what to do is the right turn lane - especially when traffic in the straight lane, and right turn lane are at different speeds (as does tend to occur during rush hour when I'm commuting - where one of the lanes is stuck in slow moving traffic and the other is filled with drivers speeding through).

I will be coming up, in the right lane pretty comfortably... and then the right lane turns into right turn ONLY lane, and the lane over to the left is the only one going straight - or worse, the left lane is both straight AND right.  

Am I supposed to try to squeeze into the left lane and take the lane with traffic going significantly faster than me? - this seems pretty dangerous to me.

Am I supposed to ride between the two lanes, and risk getting hit from either side? - also seems pretty dangerous...

 Am I supposed to keep going straight from the right turn lane, as if the right turn doesn't apply to me? - this doesn't seem correct to me either.

Am I supposed to take the right lane, and then merge into the left lane through the intersection? - this seems to be the easiest thing to do, but still doesn't seem right..

Anyway, since I know some people were interested in having only our commutes listed, and getting a total tally of our daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly commutes on Strava, I contacted the support desk and ask them what our options are.

&gt;Sorry for the trouble! Unfortunately neither of those are possible with the current features we offer - admittedly at this point the 'commute' checkbox does essentially nothing. While we definitely do have plans to improve this functionality, in ways that could address some of your concerns, it's not exactly likely that this is going to happen in the near-term.

&gt;What might be a better solution could be to reach out to your Redditors and see if any of them are handy with scripting, and could write you a tool to take advantage of our API - that way you could get exactly the information you want, and nothing more. I hope that makes sense... And sorry I don't have a better answer!

&gt;Thanks very much,

So, there we have it.  We need someone to cobble something together for us using Strava's API.  I'm going to have a poke around but I've never done anything like this, so... help? \^_\^'

I guess it isn't necessary to be too picky but If I ride this thing regularly I don't want to feel like I am riding a big disappointment that I regret every ride. The commute is something like 24 mi roundtrip. So I probably want something fairly light and quick, but I also wouldn't mind having something that can be a little fun too (bunny-hopping curbs, manuals, nose manuals, stairs, offroad). Obviously you can't have everything, but I wonder if I could get the right frame from the start, maybe it is possible for my commuter to be that chimera without having to switch more than the wheels and maybe handlebars when I want to switch it up. I'm only 5'7"". I haven't figured out this whole 26"" vs 29"" debate yet either.

Things I am looking for in a commuter bike:

* Pannier Rack compatible (I have no idea if you really need the frame mounts or not)
* Disc brake compatible. (I really, really, prefer disc brakes)
* fender compatible
* frame geometry suited for either straight or drop bars.
* maybe suitable for a short travel suspension fork (maybe not necessary but I do like to know I could throw one on if I wanted too)
* I'm not tall so I can't have a nut-cracking TT (and if I ever want to hop anything in it I have to be able to drop a little in the cockpit)
* I kinda prefer a shorter chainstay since that makes manuals easier (part of why I'm tempted to stick with 26"" wheels)

So far I'm considering these frames:

* Just getting an old XC frame and building it up like a cyclocross
* Surly Troll (Apparently it is designed for 26"" but will easily fit 700c with slicks)
* Salsa Fargo
* Salsa El Mariachi
* Surly Disc Trucker (26"" version)
* Niner SIR

Let me know if any of you experienced commuters have any input for me.

On my ride I go through an area with no street lights at all, it's about a 1/2 mile. I have a strong front light for seeing hazards in the road as well as a smaller blinky light for visability. Anyway, a few days ago I'm going downhill in this area. It's 5:30 in the morning, there's light traffic, and suddenly a wild person appears about 25-30 feet in front of me in the bike lane. There's a car behind me so I can't move over and dodge, so I move over a bit hoping the person will move into the grass (no sidewalk, but more on that later) but they don't. So, I end up hitting this persons arm/mostly lunchbox (big Coleman thing) with my handlebar. He starts cussing at me but I'm shaken (plus he still has that big Coleman lunchbox) so I'm not turning around. Left me worried about my safety taking that route again so I start taking a slightly longer route to work.


Now, about that 'missing' sidewalk: the other side of the road has a very nice and perfectly serviceable sidewalk. To me, the guy should have been over there instead of in my way. Am I wrong in assuming this? 


So about the other events: I've gone by him twice now in the past week (I got tired of the longer route, plus it goes by a chemical plant) and he's made overt gestures towards me in a threatening manner, and this morning he was again in the bike lane, but I at least had room to move out of the way as there were no cars. 

[Bike laws in WA State](http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/bike/Laws.htm)

Also, forgot to mention that he was talking towards me so he saw me before I saw him.

So what do I do? Should I call the police and say he's harassing me? Should I talk to him about it? Because of the darkness + my light, there's no way he knows it's me each time so is he threatening every bicycle that goes by him? Do I just run into him at full speed and let God sort it out?

Please help me out.,Fox_in_a_BlueBox,16,2,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/bikecommuting/comments/11wjvd/california_bicycle_laws_are_a_bit_contradicting/,"Hey guys! I'm new to bike commuting and I just moved to LA. I ran into a driver that insisted that I had no right to take the lane as a bike commuter. I insisted that I did. So for future reference I decided to look up the law and be able to present it more confidently. 

This is what I found; 

http://www.dmv.ca.gov/pubs/hdbk/shr_slow_veh.htm#bike

There are at least 4 laws that apply to the actual taking of the lane;

1. Are entitled to share the road with motor vehicles.
2. Have the same rights and responsibilities as vehicle and motorcycle drivers.
3. Shall ride as near to the right curb or edge of the roadway as practical– not on the sidewalk.
4. Are legally allowed to ride in the center of the lane when moving at the same speed as other traffic.

If I understand correctly we are entitled to be on the road with motor vehicles AND we have the same “rights and responsibilities as vehicles and motorcycle drivers.” By this I understand that I have the right to take my position in the lane and ride comfortably and safely. 

The second two are the ones that are confusing and contradicting to me. If I have to ride as close to the right curb or on the edge then I effectively lose my same “rights” as a vehicle. It does mention “as practical” but that seems to be a subjective perspective to me. Also the according to last law, we are only legally allowed to ride in the center of the lane when moving at the same speed of traffic, which is not usually possible (except for traffic, or slower marked roads). 

So what is it? Are we legally allowed to take the lane or aren’t’ we? Do we have the same rights and responsibilities as a vehicle or don’t we?

--

Personally, I DO NOT feel safe to ride as close to right as “practical.” Drivers are not respectful and speed by me all the time when I do this. I get pushed closer and closer to parked cars or the curb to the point where I might get hit by a door or lose control of my bike onto a curb. 

I do my best to stay out of the way when riding on a very busy street. I take the far right lane and allow cars to pass me on the left lane. If I’m on a one-lane street and cars are behind me I try to move over and give them space to pass. As much as I expect them to share the road with me and make me feel safe, I also don’t want to be holding up a line of 20 cars for no good reason. 

Anyway, if you guys can help me figure this out, I’d like to feel a little more confident when commuting and encountering people who are not respectful on the road. It would help me to really know my rights as a bike commuter.

Thanks!

Cars were being respectful and giving me plenty of space.

My question is the following. I found that I was stopping at almost every light (which of course is the safest), and also being stuck in somewhat of a traffic jam. Now I know that one of the perks of biking to work is not being stuck in a jam. Plus it is incredibly tiresome to stop and start all the time. 

My problem was the following; there was no bike lane. I didn't necessarily want to ride to on the right side and risk being hit by someone opening a door of a parked car (as I've been warned before). I did not want to swerve between traffic either or get on the sidewalk.

I've been using my bike to commute to work for just over 3 weeks now. I've really enjoyed my trips to and from my new-ish Lexa Trek, and just this week put clipless pedals (how did I live without them again?) on it.

I've really enjoyed riding in and out from work, but my commute is about 10 or 11 miles round trip. This is fine when I'm just biking in for work and leaving around 6 or 7 to get home... but whenever I end up hanging out with people after work, they always insist on giving me a ride home because ""it's so dark out"" or ""it's almost midnight!"" or ""you live 5.5 miles away!""

* Now, reading some of the other posts in this sub have indicated to me that a 5 mile commute isn't *really* that long... 

* Also, I have a white light on the front of my bike and a flashing red light on the back. This at least combats the dark, right?

* I wear a helmet and am very conscious of the traffic around me; I try not to ride late in the evening on big 'drinking nights' in my town. I also have a fluorescent yellow/green shirt that I leave in my biking bag to wear at night, because it's extremely visible.

Full disclosure, and I am small, 22 year old female. Is it dangerous for me to bike alone at home in the dark? Am I wrong to think that my friends should just let me be? I know they care about me, and I'm not trying to be ungrateful. I also feel really bad for inconveniencing my friends.

TL;DR - Are there any ways a petite female can keep safer while biking alone at night? And, my true first world problem - how do I keep my friends from giving me a ride home in their cars when I just want to ride my bicycle?

(Edit: if I'm an ungrateful bitch, I can definitely revise my opinions; I do appreciate what my friends are willing to do for me.

Quick question. My u-lock mounting bracket broke last week and I am looking for a good way to keep my lock on my bike while riding without buying a new lock/bracket and without looping it over my handlebars.
I rode in to work today and realized when I got here I didnt have my lock with me. I need a quick/cheap way to make sure this never happens again. I know I could keep it in my backpack...but chances are I will not always have a backpack with me. I dont use a bike rack so that wont work. 
I was thinking of putting together some kind of velcro-rig or something. Advice/ideas/pictures would be awesome. Or if you have a spare bracket hanging around your house that looks like [this](http://store.todson.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/o/n/onguard_clamp_for_u-locks_2011_-_present_.jpg) I will dance at your wedding.

I've got about $150 to burn, and I think she could use a pair of windproof gloves, maybe a large pack of those 18-hour HotHands, and I'm also thinking a nice windproof outer shell (with a thermal interior?)

Back padding, external water bottle pockets, carry handle, etc. I sent it back to timbuk2 because the padding on the back was coming off, but I'm kicking myself now, because that model was long discontinued. I bought an Especial Tres rolltop bag as a replacement, but now I'm really missing my messenger bag. I would not necessarily mind getting another timbuk2 messenger, but I wanted to lay out my options first...so here they are. But first, a small bit about my requirements.

1. Not super big. I'm 6 foot 4, but I only need this bag for daily commuting to school

2. Not too many extraneous straps. When not on my back, it will be strapped to my cetma rack.

3. Back padding would be nice, as would a laptop pocket and u-lock holster. None of them are gamechangers, but they would be nice.

With those criteria in mind, I have arrived at (quite a) few choices. I would love to hear feedback, or to get any other options that I may have missed. After using a timbuk2 messenger for a decade, I expect to get the same amount of time out of this new one, so I want to make the right choice and I don't mind spending up to around $200 to get it.

This morning, as I was nearing my office, I was coming to a red stoplight. I needed to turn left, and there were cars facing me on the opposite side of the intersection, so I tried to hold my left arm out to signal. Unfortunately, the light sat at the base of a slight downhill slope, so I needed to hit my brakes at the same moment I needed to signal.

Thankfully, nobody really saw the disastrous maneuver I pulled, which involved me nearly falling to the ground and having to skid to the side of the road. 

So, I guess my question is, what is the solution to this? Is this a common problem, having to brake and signal at the same time?

My commute is about 3.5 miles each way, which takes me around 20 minutes with lights and hills. I took the advice here and got a panniers rack/bag and some fenders for my Trek FX 7.2, but after a few commutes, I'm starting to think that there are more practical options for my commute. 

The panniers rack/bag are pretty convenient, but the limited space becomes a real problem. I pack jeans (casual work attire), socks, undershirt, dress shirt, and some lunch. It's not too bad with those items, but I'd like to bring some emergency tools also (extra tube, hand pump, ~~tool kit~~ multitool). I also bring my lock home during the weekends (I leave them at work during the week), and it gets pretty tough to fit them all. A backpack just seems more practical.

The fenders *seem* unnecessary, given I stick to relatively well-kept roads. I live in Southern California, where the weather is hot and dry 90% of the year. I'm just afraid it's one of those things that I don't notice them only because they're doing their job.

In the end, I'm looking to take some weight off my bike, but just was curious if people think this would be a bad idea given how highly these things are praised. Are there any other short-distance urban commuters that could give me some advice on their bike setup?

I want something with a little more feel to it so a higher tpi is definitely a possibility. I also really like the reflective stripe on my sidewall.

Also, there is no public transport to my job, so that is out of the picture. Does anyone have a similar situation to this one and have some advice for an aspiring bike commuter?

Edit:
Thanks for the advice, I think that I would be happier working closer to home, so I am going to look around and see what I can find within a 10 mile or so radius. For now, I found a park about seven miles from work where I can park my and ride my bike the rest of the way.

Things are great for two weeks, but the last couple days I've noticed things have been moved around - so I figure it's either housekeeping or someone else is using the shower....  nbd, right?  


Today I get in and my towel and a bathmat someone else had left in there are gone.  When I ask housekeeping the woman says that it looked as if ""someone had brought in a dog"" this morning.  It smelled terrible and my towel and bathmat were soaked/smelly so she just bundled it up and threw them out.

Over that time I've replaced a number of components that have proven to suck (the adjustable stem that wouldn't stay adjusted, the saddle, the rear gears that stripped out, etc.). But last week when climbing a steep hill that I climb every morning on the way to work, I heard a strange noise as I was cranking away and then the back wheel fell out of the frame. It turned out I'd sheared the axel. Crazy, and annoying. But perhaps not that uncommon for a crappy bike (it's got a freewheel rear hub which seems to put more strain on the axel)? I can probably fix it, but I'm honestly tired of putting money and effort into a bike I'm not overall happy with.

I'm 6'5"", weigh about 225 lbs, and ride 6 miles round trip to work (primarily on asphalt roads that are in bad shape - lots of pot holes and the like). I also occasionally have to hop off or on to a curb. So I think I need something beefier than a road bike. I also have a rear rack on my current bike, but I've only used it sparingly.

I've checked out a few LBS and while they are all happy to order something for me, none of them seem to stock bikes big enough for me, and they are also expensive (surly, raleigh, etc). I also have searched craigslist and ebay but have had the same problem with finding large enough frames. Bikesdirect has three options with 64cm frames that look appealing to me for various reasons, and I was hoping the knowledgable folk here might have good insights that I'm lacking. I was hoping to spend around $500, but that might not be possible (and all 3 options are $6-700).

1. Motobecane Cafe Noir: http://www.bikesdirect.com/products/motobecane/cafe_noir.htm
It's got a steel frame and 105 components (which I understand are good). It also has an adjustable stem, which sucked on my current bike. My current bike has straight bars, so I'd be used to that, but I'm somewhat curious what riding with a more agressive stance would be like. Can't find any reviews.


2. Motorbecane Fantom CX: http://www.bikesdirect.com/products/motobecane/fantom_cross_cx3.htm
It's got an aluminum frame and steel fork. I think I might need to replace the tires for road riding? Seems to have decent reviews.


3. Windsor Tourist: http://www.bikesdirect.com/products/windsor/tourist.htm
It's steel, comes with a rack, and seems to have decent reviews.


So are all of these viable options? Do they suck? Anything else I should consider?

I'm new to commuting and cycling (with any seriousness) in general.  Not too long ago, I purchased a single-speed road bike and have been riding it quite a bit.  A few days of commuting/week (10 miles round trip), an occasional longer ride in the evening, and a &gt;=20 miles ride on the weekend usually (longer each week as I've gotten more comfortable).

Through the past month or so, I've realized I want to upgrade from the single speed.  So I'm looking at doing so in the next few weeks.  I want to stick with a road bike.  My commute isn't long, but I enjoy longer rides on the weekends, and I see myself getting involved with group rides and charity rides and what not moving forward.

I have my list of bikes narrowed down to about 3 (5 on the list, but it will be one of the top 3 pending a test ride).  A couple have rack mounts, but most of them do not.  My top 2 choices do not have rack mounts.  My third choice would, but there is a reason it's my third choice (price point with respect to components).  For the same price, my number 1 choice would have better components almost all around.  The difference in cost of those components purchased separately would be hundreds of dollars.  So I'd be sacrificing that upside for the sake of having rack mounts pretty much and no cost savings.

Being new to using a bike to commute, I'm not even quite sure how people utilize racks all that much.  I leave clothes/shoes at work (we have lockers and showers), I have a small frame bag for tools. I don't transport a laptop back and forth.  I could see myself possibly taking a ride to pick up a handful of groceries here and there, but I've just used a back pack for that so far.  It's not ideal, but it's worked out fine.

Is there anything I'm not thinking about?

**tl:dr** --  *Getting a new bike.  Top 2 choices don't have rack mounts.  My current bike doesn't either, but I'm pretty new to riding.*   **Should I care?  What kind of stuff do you use your racks for?**



**Edit (if anybody is interested):** Ended up getting last year's version of the bike I had my eye set on... last year's model had rack mounts.  So win win.  It only has the bottom rack mounts, so I'll have to use a clamp or post adapter, but I think it will be fine for anything I may ever use it for.",,False,self,t5_2tbmq,1368503975.0,,,True,t3_1e69y4,http://www.reddit.com/r/bikecommuting/comments/1e69y4/how_important_are_rack_mountshow_do_you_make_use/,

I'm currently commuting with some Alexrims DM18, and they're starting to wear off (after thousands of KMs). Don't get me wrong, but they did quite a good job with all the holes and stuff they went through.

Apart from the aesthetic (where I would definitely prefer a completely blank with no huge bulky graphics on them), and the price (where I'd spend no more than 200£ for a pair) I don't have much else I can base my judgement on them.

I'm only 5'7 with a 30"" inseam (75cm)

The smallest frame they have for the 700c model is the 56cm and according to their website, it has a 32"" standover height (81.2cm). Does this mean I need to forget about this bike. I've always been a mountain biker of the DH sort and having a standover height greater than my inseam was always a no-go, is it different for road bikes?

I commute on a road bike with no rack mounts or anything like that (it's a carbon  roadie) so I take all my crap to work on my back.

My Targus laptop backpack is getting a bit sad so I need to replace it. I want something that has a laptop pouch and is intended for cycling.

The main things I want is a bit of water resistance, which my Targus back is good for, and a hard bit flexible piece of plastic covering the back of the bag. My hydration pack that I take mountain biking has this plastic bit and it's sewn to it only down the middle so when you pack the bag full and it goes round the plastic is still flat and prevents any pointy things in my back.

I drew a [crappy picture](http://imgur.com/D0QQM) in case my explanation isn't good enough.

Basically I just want something to prevent the pointy bits 

I someone able to recommend a bag that might fit my needs? I do live in New Zealand so unfortunately my market is quite small, so finding some brands might be difficult.

Thanks!

Edit: I bought a Macpac ""Commuter 28 VTD"". It has a pretty good looking frame to keep it rigid and will keep the pack off my back so hopefully much less sweaty back. Includes pouch for bladder and loops to run the hose so it should be good for the longer mountain bike rides too. Haven't used it yet but I'm going to be walking around Indonesia for 5 days with it next week.

I commute an 18 mile round-trip through central London 5 times a week. I currently have a [Dahon Matrix](http://www.dahon.com/bikes/2011/matrix) full-size folder which I never need to fold. So now I want to get a non-folding commuter as I never fold my bike and it is creaky and it is heavy.

I want to support my awesome little LBS, they are an Orbea dealer and they have these beautiful bikes in, which I have been researching for some time and I think are just the bike for me on my budget (plus the blue and red colour is beautiful).
http://www.orbea.com/gb-en/bicis/modelos/carpe_h30/#presentacion

They are aluminium frame.

My question is, they offer a carbon fork rather than the rigid aluminium fork for £95 extra. I have no carbon experience but have been trying to read up on them. I currently ride with entry level Suntour suspension forks on my Dahon and some roads on my London commute are badly maintained. The suspension helps with this and I am worried I will miss it (but certainly not the weight!). Some are potholey but others are just a real rough surface. I know a carbon fork won't do anything over potholes (I can steer round those), but I'm hoping that it will make the rougher surfaces a bit more bearable, or at least dampen some road vibration at good speeds. 

The weight of the carbon fork over the alu fork has some appeal but I will be adding fenders and a pannier rack to the bike. I'm not interested in making my bike as light as possible, but I figure that I can offset the weight of the  rack a little that can be a good thing, right?

In short - should I get the carbon fork or stick with the alu rigid fork? The extra expense isn't a big deal as I will be getting the bike via a salary sacrifice scheme so I will barely notice it.

Anyone commute on an alu frame with carbon fork? Does it make a difference? I want my new Orbea to be as awesome as possible :-)

To make it worse, I didn't have a solid route down and ended up riding on a grassy frontage for about a quarter mile, which was the one place where I almost tipped over.  I hit a soft patch of grass and came to a near stop and while trying to balance, accidentally clipped back in as I started to topple.  I managed to pop out again before I overbalanced.

All in all, I like it.  I need to adjust the tightness, one side of one of the pedals is way too lose--- I can early hear it click in and it releases if I breathe too hard.   

I also need to figure out a process for adjusting the position of the cleats.  My left foot needs to have the heel moved out a half inch and the right foot is too far forward a bit.  I've done the 'clip in, clip out, adjust, clip in' several times and it just seems like I keep missing the mark one way or another.  

TL;DR - installed clipless, didn't topple, liked it, need to figure out how to adjust the cleats.  Brats are good.  Free ones are better.

Don’t really know in which of all these bicycle-related subreddits I should post this (I’ve been lurking around here for a while and I’m still not quite sure), but I’ll give it a try here first.

After my beautiful (used) retro-style burgundy Releigh Courier got stolen a week ago ([picture](http://i.imgur.com/zIyhKWy.jpg)), I have now decided to buy a new bicycle – not used – and get it insured.

Generally I really enjoyed sitting fairly upright, 3 gears are just about right but 7 probably won’t do me any harm, but finding a bicycle that has even a remotely similar vintage look or feeling to it seems impossible.

I am currently looking at a Schwinn Coffee 1 and a 2013 Giant Cypress, but neither of them look quite right to me, but if I can’t find anything better I will probably go for the Coffee 1. I was also looking at the Gazelle Tour Populair RT 2013 (what a beauty) but I’m afraid it might be a bit heavy? 20kg, is that a lot? I’m such an amateur.

I guess I should also mention that my commute to university is only 3-4 miles long and involves a slight ascent easily manageable with 3 gears, but a fairly light bicycle would be nice. Also I live in the UK and sometimes cycle along the beach, no big mountains here - but a few steep roads around town.

Price… Anything under £600 really. Fairly flexible.

I've been doing some research and am currently putting together an agenda - but thought I'd check in with y'all and see if anyone has any trainings, resources, or tips they'd like to share.  

Has anyone ever been to a Bicycle Commuter Training? I'd love to hear your experiences - things you enjoyed/found really informative or things you would've liked to be included.  

Background info: I already have a space to host the workshop (our newly opened Community Bike Shop).  We don't really have a lot of money to hire someone to come talk - I know the League of American Bicyclists has training you can get them to come put on.  Also, Jackson has a growing, but still very small bike culture.  Our streets are pretty bad, so it's gonna take a bit to get people out - but I know we can do it!  Hopefully though trainings and encouragement, we can get more people using bike for transportation in Jackson!


EDIT: Proposed Agenda: DRAFT - feedback welcome!

Intros (5min) - who you are why you bike

Bikes as Traffic (5 min)
      - put safety first
      - be courteous
      - be legal

Where to Ride (15min)

How to Ride (15 min)
   - don't salmon
   - hold your line
   - dealing with rough streets/potholes
   - holding your line
   - signaling

Your Bike/Gear (15min)
   - types of bikes (hint - it doesn't matter what you ride)
   - helmet/lights/bells
   - basket vs. panniers vs. backpack/messenger bag
   - Clothing (you don't need a kit)

Riding in Weather (10 min)
   - riding in rain (fenders, rain pants, rain cape)
   - riding in heat (drink water, bring extra clothes)
   - riding in cold (layer up - we don't really have snow here)

 At Work (10 min)
   - locking up your bike (hands on)
   - cleansing yourself/looking professional (showers, baby wipes, change of clothes, extra set of make up)

Biking Buddies (30 min)
   - make SMART goals to ride weekly
   - pair up people at workshop to be ""accountabil-a buddies""
   - help each other plan routes to work (we will have maps available)

So: riding in the rain effing sucks. And the snow. Even moreso at night. What I want, what I crave, are yellow/amber-tinted sunglasses. Not just the kind that are colored-on-the-outside-but-still-black because those are useless when it rains at night -- think ski goggles.

My mom used to have a pair of yellowy-tinted Oakleys that were lovely for this sort of thing.

I was also thinking [these](http://www.oakley.com/products/1239/2582) Oakleys might not be so awful, and are considerably cheaper. Their chick sunglasses (I am, in fact, of the female variety) all kinda suck, and I've had their ""men's"" sunglasses before with no issues.

In the meantime: does anyone else ride in sunglasses? I want high quality, *comfy* sunglasses that I can wear the hell out of.

If it comes to forking over $200 for a *good* pair of sunglasses that will last me many thousands of miles (100+ miles/week, training for a century this summer...so even if they only last a year, it's still thousands of miles), well, that ain't bad at all.",,False,self,t5_2tbmq,False,,,True,t3_15j15r,http://www.reddit.com/r/bikecommuting/comments/15j15r/sunglasses_what_should_i_invest_in/,

It took me three hours to finally get it done (and find a way to get air at 9 o'clock at night).  Mind you I took frustration breaks, but still.  Three hours.

I am thrilled.  I gleefully tell my friend that I fixed it and I won't need a ride home, and I hop on my bike.

Things seem to be going great until I'm about halfway home (fortunately it's only a four mile commute).  I notice that my front tire is giving me more resistance.  No, I cry to myself as it starts to rain.  Yes, despite seeming to be full of air when I left campus this evening, it was now completely deflated.

And so I ran/walked home for two miles in the rain.  After dark.  And I live in the country so we only have periodic street lights.

Tomorrow I am driving to campus and will ask the friendly bike shop people to teach me a more efficient way to fix a flat and will order TWO spare tubes, levers, a small pump, and a bike bag so I will never be stuck walking home again.

I don't know how much it weighs, but it feels pretty hefty when I put it in the shed.  This may very well be due to the rack and panniers though.  Anyway, I'm thinking of upgrading to something lighter, that I could possibly take for a road ride or two on the weekends.  So, primarily I'm looking for something to commute on, but I'd like to go for a recreational (read: not serious road race trials) ride on some weekends (when I'm not bombing down the mountain on my [29er](http://i.imgur.com/Pqcetel.jpg))

**Commute details:**
* 8.7 km (5.4 mi) with about 100 m (330 ft.) of climb, 70 m (230 ft.) of which happens over about 1.5 km (0.9 mi.)
* No real heavy traffic.  The climb is up a bypass road that only has light traffic, most of which is heading the other direction, across the median and then on the highway.  95% of it is in a bike lane.

I'm looking at one of these two:

* [Giant Defy 3](http://www.giant-bicycles.com/en-ca/bikes/model/defy.3/12294/58203/)

* [Specialized Secteur Compact](http://www.specialized.com/ca/en/bikes/road/secteur/secteurcompact)

The two bike shops in town (and within a 1500 km radius) carry:

* Giant

* Kona

* Specialized

* Rocky Mountain


I'd be open to an entry/intro road bike with rack mounts from any of those brands.  I know that the shops carry the Defy and the Secteur so I can get on them and try them out.  I'm kind of weird shaped, (5'11"", 30"" inseam, currently 210 lbs).  I don't know what that means, geometry wise, but I'm sure it will come into play somewhere in whole fitting process.

I've never ridden a road bike, only mountain bikes.

I'm not sure what the difference is (if any) between those two bikes.  I might be willing to bump up one ""trim"" level (pardon my ignorance) to get the ""zerts"" in the specialized frame (and if its worth it, frame/fork wise to go up one in the Giant as well).  Anyway, I imagine there's some difference in components, but honestly I don't know what they are.  Are there any glaring differences between the two?  One thing I noticed is that the Giant comes with brake levers on both the drop and the horizontal part of the handlebar, while the Specialized only has levers on the drop part of the bar.  I like the idea of levers on the horizontal part of the bar, as it offers another riding position.  

Internet reviews are good for both, the ones I've read anyway.  I'd love to hear from anyone that has these bikes (or models in the lineup) with pros/cons/likes/dislikes.

Obviously I'm going to try them out as best I can before dropping $1,000+ on a bike.  

I've looked at pure commuters, but I've decided that they aren't for me.  They aren't different enough from my current bike to justify the cost, and I feel like a road bike opens more doors to explore more biking for me.

tl;dr please give me some advice about entry level road bikes to be used as a commuter.

**EDIT**
Thanks for all the help!  I'm leaning towards the Giant but I want to ride both of them to see.  I may even be able to squirrel away enough money to go up one level in either (the Defy 2 or the Secteur Compact Sport) but I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.

We compensate car travel at a rate of $0.36/km and travel time is counted as working hours.

I (along with a few others in my organization) have to regularly travel ~50km, ~100km, and ~200km trips, and I've recently started cycling instead of driving. I'm trying to get a formal policy in place for compensation.

Since clocking hours for it would simply be too much, I am thinking of proposing that the rider is allowed to only count the hours it would take to drive as working hours. Anything more than that is on personal time. However, the rider can claim the $0.36/km for themselves. With car travel, this generally just goes toward fuel, maintenance, insurance, etc. My proposal is that instead of that money going toward fossil fuel industries, it goes straight to the rider to compensate for their time (and the wear and tear). Meals can be compensated separately, and that is no problem.

This gives a flat incentive to each employee (why should the ED be paid more than me to cycle?) and also incentivizes general fitness. For example, one route I cycled was 110km and took me 5 hours. To drive this, I could claim ~$40. Cycling, that works out to about $8/hour. If I improve my fitness, I could likely soon do it in 4 hours, working out to $10/hour, and so on.

And I'm talking about low-volume, residential streets; not main arteries.

To what extent is it acceptable to ""blow through"" these stop signs?  If there is good visibility, I'll typically go through them full speed.  If visibility is limited, I'll slow down to the extent necessary to make sure the way is clear.

The *real* potential issue for me is when cars are present or approaching.  In my experience (and that may be extremely limited to my specific location), *most* of the motorists and cyclists have an ""unspoken agreement"" that the cars will give the cyclists the right of way.  And keep in mind, that since these are residential streets, 90% (or more) of the people driving on them live in the neighborhoods and drive those roads - and cross that trail - every day.

So if a car is at the stop sign and sees a bike approaching, they pretty much always let the cycle blow through the stop sign.  Basically, if the cyclist tries to stop, it gets into a ""courtesy battle"" with both the car and the cyclist waving the other one through.  Certainly not a huge problem, but a minor annoyance.

I'm always *very prepared* to stop just in case the guy sitting at the stop sign is part of the 10% who is unfamiliar with this ""unspoken agreement"".  But in 18 months of riding 2-3 times per week on these trails, that has happened only once.... and honestly, it was no big deal (I was slowing down and prepared to stop, but expecting to blow through the stop sign.  The car started to go through, so I hit the brakes and stopped with plenty of time).

Honestly, these crossings are probably the most dangerous part of my ride.  While death is unlikely, a low-speed t-bone is more likely at these intersections than any other potential crash anywhere on my route.  Certainly it would be safer to come to a complete stop every time, but I honestly think motorists would be more confused by that than the current ""unspoken rule"" that we all seem to be abiding by right now.",,False,self,t5_2tbmq,False,,,True,t3_1flrtl,http://www.reddit.com/r/bikecommuting/comments/1flrtl/lets_talk_about_trails_crossing_residential/,

I am here in Alaska, Anchorage. To give an example of the weather I'm dealing with, it is forecast to SNOW tomorrow. In May. Today, I rode a very short distance for Bike to Work day, stopped at a food stand and everything else was fine (I waterproof myself and my gear like NO ONE'S BUSINESS) but my hands quickly became cold as the miserable rain increased.

My question to you, especially you who have cycled in the Pacific Northwest region:

What are your suggestions for fairly rain proof or rain friendly gloves?

I still need dexterity since, even though Alaskan drivers are apparently leagues better than **some** down-south, they can still be VERY unobservant of the cycling banana (yellow high visibility jacket) and I need to stop quickly.

I'm okay with neoprene IF someone with bad circulation issues (can't seem to stay warm when other normal humans are fine) can manage to not have icicle hands after riding 20 miles (max distance I'll be using them for in the foreseeable future).

I'd prefer something that isn't quiet as bulky as WINTER riding gloves. I already have a pair anyway.

Google is being little help to me.

I told her about 40 bucks per tire, but I could go up to 50 I think, if you can convince me it's worth it. Also might consider spending more on just a back tire for now as that's where the flats usually occur, and getting another tire later for the front, but I really am not too keen on that idea. On the other hand, I really hate getting flats, so I would definitely consider sucking it up and biting the bullet.

So 40 - 50 bucks, which tire and best place to get them?

Oh ya, some extra info.

Mostly pavement in Norfolk, VA. Lot's of glass. I do go off road some though, usually hard dirt but sometimes gravely hard surface and through grass. We have a lot of that sticker grass crap what ever its called here.  With the little balls of thorn, pretty short thorns for the most part.

I am also planning on riding about 5-7 miles to work. So about 10 - 14 to and from work. I also practice yoga a couple days a week which the place is about 3 miles away and want to keep exercising without my back stiffening up.

Or should I just wait until I get medical clearance?

**N**ew commuter here as of this week.  With winter on its way here soon, I thought I would come to this subreddit with a few questions for you fellow winter commuters.

**Why I'm Commuting:**
**R**ecently landed a job a couple towns over (Approx. 12mi.) and have been happily commuting.  However, with the cost of insurance, the economy and price of gas these days,  I would much rather suffer a bit for a few minutes every day in the cold, than be separated from my hard earned money (I'd be sacrificing approx. 38 hours of work pay a month just to arrive to work with a vehicle.)


**About My Commute**

**My** current route is 12 miles one way.  There are five long, rolling hills along the commute.  Almost all of the roads to my work are narrow, very busy and have a 40-50+mph speed limit.  With this in mind, I am basically forced on the sidewalks the whole way to work.  During the winter, people rarely plow snow away on the sidewalks around here, so I would be riding through fresh powder, uphill and downhill over the course of 12 miles.

**Questions**

* **1.)**  What are your recommendations and advice as far as riding hills on minimally maintained winter sidewalks?

* **2.)**  What are the few most important bits of advice you would give to someone considering winter commuting?

* **3.)**  Considering the purchase of a Surly fatbike for the very purpose of Winter commuting.  Thoughts, input?

First I'd just like to say how much I enjoy this subreddit. When I first started riding into work, seeing a bunch of other people here doing it as well was good inspiration to keep me going.

I was legally taking the lane on a busy street. This particular street connects to a major highway and it just so happens that you  have to turn right to get onto it. The far lane I was in is quite wide, or according to some drivers wide enough to whizz buy me on the right, FREAKING ME OUT! To get onto the highway. This happened too  many times, so now I usually try to stay in the middle of the lane so that drivers don't have a chance to pass me on the right, because I find it particularly scary when they do that. Anyway one driver starts honking at me. I reach a red light by the onramp and stop. The driver proceeds to roll down his window and insult me loudly. My Latin/Italian/German mix kicks in and I slur some loud quite rude insults right back at him. He gives  up and continues his way onto the highway. The driver behind him pulls down his window and just shakes his head at me disapprovingly. I of course, all riled up insult him as well. 

As I drove away, I felt shamed. Though I had good reason to be absolutely incredibly mad I could have handled it a lot better and safer for me. I could have pulled my phone out to call the cops. I could have just ignored him. 

I'm fairly new at biking and I know I'm going to encounter drivers like this a lot and I need to learn to handle it in a less stressful way for me. I don't want biking/commuting to become an absolutely unpleasant thing to do for me.

The end. 

UPDATE: 

So after much debate I decided to take a different route. I was uneasy about it at first because I'm new to town and I don't know my way around very well. So I had to take an extra 30 minutes to stop and go while checking directions. But it was so worth it! I've only taken the alternate route a couple of times but it is much more enjoyable. I mostly drive through a quiet neighborhood. I had one drive shake is hands at me, but in the end he is the stressed on and I'm just riding along. The only stress is this one specific stretch that I have right before I get home on Vineland, I have no way to avoid it and people insist on passing me on the right. Its not long but definitely my least favorite section.

New York City, and my previous home of San Francisco, are nothing like this. Bike parking is missing everywhere, motorists hate cyclists, cyclists hate motorists, etc.

In relation to park biking. Is there something that can be done about this? I've thought about it and wondered why we don't see community supported bike parking. Fine, motorists don't want to give up there precious parking spaces, but what building were to give up storage space for public use?

For example, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, the Bedford stop is litered with bikes, which take up the side walk and have a habit og being stolen. What if there was a bike storage place near by?

Switched bikes.,clausy,6,0,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/bikecommuting/comments/1duokb/random_notes_from_todays_commute_switched_bikes/,"I think I blew out my second bottom bracket. Shimano, 1st after 2500, second after another 2500 miles. It's started making a metallic grinding noise which I think means the bearings are rusted out. Last one fell to pieces after I removed the crank to see what the hell was making that noise. I ride fixed, in London and it has been raining for about a year (with the exception of the last couple of weeks). I think the wear and tear kills them quickly. Does anyone else have life expectancy issues with bottom brackets?

Anyway, so I switched bikes this morning. Took the Planet X Pro Carbon, packed an extra lock and set off. Unfortunately there was a lot of traffic but I still managed 5 PRs out of about 20 on the 10 mile route. In general when you get the space it looks like the road bike is about 10-15% faster than the fixed gear on a 48/16 ratio, in a regular city commute scenario. I guess I'm not really surprised, probably accelerating faster, braking later, and actually topping out a bit faster: over the whole commute it's actually barely quicker due to traffic, lights etc. Yes I stop.


A couple of other things that I noted today:

Pedestrians who press the Walk button, then look up to see if anything's coming, nothing is, except me, so they cross and by the time I get there, they're gone, and the light is red. I hate you.

Cyclists (and there are a lot at the moment, sun's out for a change) who ride in the outside of the cycle or bus lane. Move over please, someone might want to get by without pulling into traffic. These are the same people that swear at you if you overtake on the inside. In fact I saw a couple of cyclists arguing this morning about who swerved in front of who. Smile please.

I need a new backpack... I now commute from home, to the gym (1.5 mile), to work (another 7 miles).

Do you think this bike will suit my needs?

It's a brand new Cannondale Quick Cross from 2012, but I'm not sure exactly which model. They guy selling it is working in the bicycle industry and says he bought it on auction in Holland, I've checked him up and he seems legit, but doesn't have a reciept. Could this be a problem if I need to get it repaired or something?

The bike fits me and he's selling it to me for 620 euro. Is the price right?

I'd only had one other puncture in 18 months until I put in a couple of Specialized tubes (700x18-23). They were losing 40psi a week compared to the old Contis. 3 for £10. Now I know why, I guess. One pinch and they pop. And I'd pumped them up that morning to 100psi so they weren't underinflated.

Current crankset is 42/52.

I've been commuting for about a month now, starting from an absolute beginner. I have a hill on my commute that I have yet to be able to conquer. The hardest part is about a half mile with a 6% grade. I've been making decent progress as I get in better shape, but am starting to think I'd like a lower gear. I get between 1/2 - 3/4 up the hill and have to get off, catch my breath, and walk the bike a bit. 

I'm not interested in going particularly fast. I've stayed on the 42T sprocket the entire time so far.

I was thinking of something like this: http://www.sram.com/sram/road/products/sram-apex-crankset#/path/term-id/254

So should I

* Stop being a wimp, punch myself in the face a few times, and keep after it
* Lose some weight (the body fat kind, i'm 6'4'' 230lb)
* Go to the LBS and look into getting a smaller crankset
* Look into clipless pedals

Will my bike support a change like this?
When I get in better shape will I be flying up this hill without breaking a sweat on my current gearing.
Am I speaking reasonable bike-speak yet or is my wording a little off?

I want to ride to college - 13mi each way but the issue is my route:
Right at the start it has a 1.5mi hill with the first part at 18%. The rest is gradual climbs and descents. On the way back after a gradual rise the whole way I'd descend that hill and have a 2mi climb that isn't quite as steep but still very uncomfortable when tired - even when I was fit.

The only other reasonable route (perhaps for off days?) is 3mi to a train that'll get me the rest of the way, it has steeper hills but in an interval fashion so easier than the start of the main route.

* Slow way down
* Stand on your pedals
* Shift your body backwards so your center of gravity (your navel, more or less) is behind your saddle.
* Get ready to pedal, and feel loose.

Here's the finesse part:

* Apply the brakes until the wheels stop rotating
* Don't let your center of gravity stop moving; let your body momentum shift forward.
* Release the brakes and start pedaling after your navel has traveled forward a bit.
* You will still have retained some of your forward momentum -- just not as much as if you blew through the stop sign with only a token squeeze of the brake.

I do this because it's fun. And when I slow down enough to pull this off, I know I've really done my diligence; I'm not just rationalizing that I ""saw that it was clear before passing through.""

I want a messenger bag that will tolerate me biking in not-so-great weather, and will look fine when I go to conferences and present.

There are a few things I know I want in the bag:
* Easily adjustable strap (someone told me that what I'm looking for is called a cam buckle), like the one pictured [here](http://i.imgur.com/RzLwcYR.jpg) on the right, although not necessarily attached to the body of the bag, and I don't need the quick release.
* Padded laptop compartment, preferably attached to the bag rather than an area to put a laptop in a sleeve.
* No velcro, or velcro that can be covered. I brought a bag that used velcro to close to a conference a month ago, and found that when I walked into a talk late, it caused a huge disturbance when I opened my bag.

These three are the things I can't live without. I'm also hoping to find a bad that has the following:
* Some kind of cross-chest stabilizer strap.
* A variety of small pockets (the bag I bought to play with this week has a couple large pockets, which makes organizing things like USB drives, erasers, etc. difficult.
* Laptop in a separate pocket from the main pocket, so that I don't lose too much space when I'm carrying a laptop.

I'm looking at putting together a real commuter bike, as I live in Florida and can do it year-round without worrying about the weather (other than the occasional hurricane), and am looking for advice. My work commute is perhaps 10mi each way, backroads the whole time. This doesn't have a set price point, though I tend to be sensitive to cost/performance ratios without sacrificing quality to obtain something marginally cheaper.

With that in mind, my current list is:

SomaFab Double Cross DC with the mounts for disc brakes

RevoLights for always-on awareness lights

Adamo Road saddle, as I have them on my ""serious"" bikes and love them.

105 pedals - I'm too deep in SPD-SL to switch to something else just for my commuter, plus I have a pair of Shimano R190s I got at a warehouse sale to use.


Other than that... I'm open. I'm particularly interested in the setup for mechanical disc brakes (complete wheels, custom-build components, the calipers, etc) as I know next to squat about them. This will be a drop bar, probably 105 groupset bike, as I detest flat-bar setups. I can do all the wrenching myself - I maintain my race bikes already.

On my way home from work this evening I was doored, and thankfully I came away mostly unscathed. A young valet driver wasn't paying attention, opened his door into the bike lane, and I did the best I could to dodge him but nonetheless he clipped me.

On the upside, he really only made contact with my right foot. It probably wouldn't have been too bad, except it was a section of the road where you can really pick up a decent amount of speed, so I was trucking along at a pretty good clip. Anyways, my foot is all banged up but seems to be intact other than a few cuts. The door of the car was bent up a bit apparently, but it's no worse for wear (as if I care all that much right now). 

As for my bike, other than the pedal on the right side being pretty banged up, I *think* it's okay. The question I have is if there is anything I should check on the bike that I may not have noticed at first glance. I rode it home well enough, so I imagine everything's fine, but I'm not much of a bike mechanic. Should I be worried about any of the gears or anything being out of sorts? I didn't notice any weird noises or anything, so I'm hopeful all is well.

Also, I got the phone number of the valet company, but I didn't call the cops or anything crazy. Was that bad on my part? If anything on my bike is screwed up, am I more than likely on my own at this point? It seemed like all was well, and the driver was incredibly apologetic and obviously felt terrible about the situation. I was just thrilled that I didn't flip over my bars or get thrown into traffic. At that point I was more than happy to get my ass home and assess the damage to my foot.

Anyways, appreciate any insight and advice you all can provide. ",,False,self,t5_2tbmq,False,,,True,t3_1kghct,http://www.reddit.com/r/bikecommuting/comments/1kghct/got_slightly_doored_today_have_a_couple_of/,

Currently, I have a Mongoose Spark MTB with dual suspension that I got at Walmart (Haha, I know) about 3 years ago for 100 bucks. I also have a Topeak rack and basket on the back. I've probably put close 1,000 miles on it these past 3 years, doing the GAP and C&amp;O twice and just biking around for fun. I've been having some problems recently with the rear wheel and constant punctures, and just got some new rim cloth on. 

I'm planning on starting my daily commute to classes in about 2 weeks. I'll be taking a rails to trails path for 95% of the way (which is mostly smooth gravel, really packed down) then obviously macadam road on campus. It's about 7.5 miles to campus from where I live. 

Should I just invest in a better bike now to save me the hassle of continuous repairs on my Mongoose? On the same note, at my LBS, they recommended that if I would get a new bike it be the Globe Work 01. Do you guys have any other suggestions for what to get?

Hello, everyone. Just got out of the hospital a few days ago from a biking related injury and I just figured I'd share my story and just remind everyone to be careful out there!

I'm a casual commuter who just moved to Pittsburgh, PA for a job/job training. I don't currently own a car, so I bought myself a monthly bus pass and was taking a roughly 50 minute bus and subway commute each way every day for a 4 hour class. I have a lot of friends in the area and was sleeping on couches and floors for the first few weeks of this 10 week job training, so I never moved move my bike to the city with me. 

On Tuesday of last week, I finally got myself into a sublet and was excited to finally move my bike in with me. On Wednesday night after class, I wanted to go for a ride to get to know the neighborhood a bit better and consider some commuting options. I changed and got my bag all ready, then realized that both my headlight and tail light had fallen/broken off during the journey to Pittsburgh. So Thursday after class, I bussed it to REI, purchased some new lights, dealt with a bunch of other unrelated BS before I got back to the place I was subletting. I got in, sat down for 20 minutes, changed, got my bag ready, installed my new lights, threw my bike over my shoulder and at about 11:30 PM, headed down the 9 steps that separate the porch from the sidewalk. 

As this was only my 4th or 5th time descending these steps, it didn't occur to me that the last step is nearly twice as deep as other the 8 (and anyone who knows Pittsburgh knows that almost every street is a hill, and this was no exception - making the last step even more awkward). I came down full force with my right foot expecting a step, and when one wasn't there, I landed very strangely and rolled my ankle outwards. I tried to catch myself with my left leg and rolled that one, as well. I knew I heard a ""pop"" as I went down and was shaking with anticipation of feeling a bone sticking out. Thankfully, there was none. But, I felt that my right leg had dislocated forward off of my ankle. In that moment of fear/adrenaline/shock, I just squeezed and felt it move back into place. I felt somewhat relieved, thinking that it was simply dislocated. When I tried to lift myself off of the sidewalk and up onto the steps, I pushed up with my arms to try to scoot myself backwards up on to the steps. When I started lifting my leg, I immediately felt it fall back out of place. It was then that I got my phone out and called my new housemate to tell him that I need to go to the hospital. 

After many hours of sitting and waiting, and waiting, and waiting...I find out that my right leg is fractured and dislocated and my left ankle is badly sprained. I first had to undergo a conscious sedation to set the right leg back in place (which didn't set correctly and had to be redone immediately upon me coming out of the sedation). After a few hours, Friday morning by this point, I was taken to the OR and had a plate and screws put in to stabilize the fracture and some work done to my tendons as well, apparently. I was out of it almost all the rest of Friday, spent all of Saturday and half of Sunday recovering at the hospital. 

All this over one step. *One. Single. Step.* Now, I didn't write all this out expecting to have a big pity party for myself. I just wanted to point out how easily and randomly anyone can get hurt and urge everyone to enjoy every moment they have riding, because it can be taken away just like that. I was lucky enough to (hopefully) not have any permanent or lasting complications, but it could have just as easily been that much worse.



***TLDR: Carrying my bike down unfamiliar steps, fell and broke my right leg and sprained the left ankle. Spent 3 days in the hospital, underwent 2 conscious sedations and one surgery to put a plate and screws in my leg.***

I'm in the market for a big bag.

This is all well and good, but I have a kitty who will need to get to the vet. I won't be living within walking distance of a PetsMart (where I have to take him, or at least it makes the most sense to because I signed him up for their health insurance stuff...he's needed some otherwise-expensive surgeries lately, the poor little guy), which means I'll need a way to transport the cat from home to vet.

&gt;Hey cool customer service person reading this, 

&gt;can you find out for me if your company has any plans to ever release a bicycle commuter line of clothing? Or just to market to commuters? It's probably a silly idea (though Levi has done it as you know) but as someone who bikes and who prefers to dress for the destination rather than the ride it would be really meaningful to have a company like Gap Inc. recognizing the potential of this. As it stands now there's so much money to be made in the lycra and gortex trade that I can't believe for a second that you not thought about usurping these sport companies and try to put everyday riders in your jeans and khakis, dress shirts and sweaters. And in case you're not aware, wool is the it material for bicycling these days and I'm pretty sure you're familiar with it. 


&gt;Also, I notice that three of your headquarters are in cities with a Bixi public bike sharing system. That's probably just a coincidence but it's something.


&gt;More people on bikes, and more stores in my mall carrying bike commuting gear. That's my dream.


&gt;Be the change, and peace and bike grease (oh, that's something you're going to have to be aware of btw).

Alright, r/bikecommuters, I totally understand why lycra and goretex are popular (because it's damn hot where some of us live) but for those of us commuting 5 miles or less, dressing for the destination is a real option and it'd be nice to have some companies more ""out there"" with their bike commuting love (and love is what it's all about) :) 

Let me know what you think, and if you agree then take the time to email some companies you think should get on board with your favorite form of transportation.

I need some advice on urban style (hybrid) bikes. The main two bikes I'm interested in are: Cannondale BadBoy 5 or 9 and Scott Sub 10 or 20. I name them for those of you that have ridden or own the bikes. 


My current bike is a CAAD10 that I bought last year and I absolutely love. However, when commuting I don't want to worry about wearing my cleats for clipless pedals, clipping in and out at all the red lights and stops through Indianapolis etc. I also don't want to load my CAAD up with lights and platform pedals that I would have to swap for my evening rides  of 20-30 miles. Big cushier tireds would also be a huge plus!
The questions I have are:


1. Will I really notice the weight increase on a very flat 7mile commute (one-way)?


2. Other than road/paved trails what type of terrain can these bikes handle stock setup? For instance the GF and I love to camp, most of the areas we go have hard packed dirt/gravel. Bumps don't bother me but will the tires suffer, flats, derailer issues, poor traction etc?


3. Lastly, internal gear hub options. This is probably my greatest concern. Does having an IGH really pigeon-hole me into have a strictly city commuter? Will I adapt to the wide cassette spacing? I've learned to spin my road bike at a higher cadence as per recommendations from reddit :) My GF has an older Sub30 (27 speed maybe) will I have pacing troubles if she has many more gears - we like to go out to eat via bike on the weekends ~10 miles, flat, Indy to BroadRipple area for those familiar.
