1363768084.0,41,self.Reprap,1aniuy,PSA: Avoid Terawatt Industries - lousy part quality and legal threats against buyers who report them,mitchese,47,6,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/Reprap/comments/1aniuy/psa_avoid_terawatt_industries_lousy_part_quality/,"Trouble is happening on the MendelMax mailing list.  A user purchased parts from Terawatt Industries, which were [very poor quality](http://imgur.com/a/LzWli).  The first post didn't even mention the seller, but based on responses from the community, eventually the seller was made public.

Ok, mistakes can happen, someone fails to check a part on the way out the door, no big deal.  The next message from the user is quite troubling though: 

&gt; I received an email in which the owner said he was going to speak 
&gt; with a lawyer about a ""a potential defamation case"".  As a 
&gt; reasonable person, I can sympathize over possible loss of business,
&gt; but I honestly don't feel I said or did anything slanderous or 
&gt; contrary to the truth.  I simply posted pictures of the parts I 
&gt; received.  I even mentioned positives such as the universal y-axis 
&gt; table quality. The thread was simply started to ask whether or not
&gt; I received printed parts that were, in the eyes of more seasoned 
&gt; DIY 3D printer enthusiasts, acceptable.  I don't think anyone here 
&gt; would disagree with that.   I'm just a newbie trying to build my first 
&gt; 3D printer.  That said, the threat was quite concerning so I 
&gt; removed all images in haste.  In the age of review websites such 
&gt; as Yelp and Amazon, not to mention Youtube, I'd be surprised that 
&gt; a suit case like this would even get filed, but I'm not a lawyer.
&gt;
&gt;That said, I'd like to kindly ask the moderator to delete the entire 
&gt; thread as to avoid any potential legal actions taken against me.

There is a post on the [Terawatt Blog](http://blog.terawattindustries.com/2013/03/19/mendelmax-1-5-parts-quality/) which tries to explain that the quality of reprap parts is hard to obtain using cheap repraps. Somehow the parts I bought from a commercial seller were of excellent quality (nothing warped, every hole was to spec), and parts I produce are much better than what Terawatt produced in the attached pictures.

The complete thread is [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/mendelmax/Yrox64RHdSQ).  Unfortunately some of the posts have been removed because of the scare tactics from Terawatt.

I can build basic electronics and can follow schematics for building stuff that is beyond my current EE designing skill set.  I've also got a lot of experience with programming Arduino's as that's what first got me interested in EE.  I've been teaching myself Blender 3D for the past couple of years and understand the basics of building 3D models.  I was looking at the Makerbot for a while, but the repraps cost barrier is so much more reasonable and I like the fact that the hardware and software seem so hackable.  I'm really leaning toward the prussa air 2, but I'll probably spend the next month or two researching the hell out of the current state of Reprap designs.  

I was hoping I could get some advice about the pitfalls to avoid and any insights about the build process from people who have already built their own reprap.

**EDIT:** *Holy crap on a cracker, you guys are awesome...and very detailed in your responses.  Thank you so much for all the info.  I'm on my lunch break right now and was going to try and respond to each of the comments.  If I don't get through them all I'll be back on Saturday morning to go over it all.*

**EDIT2:** *I probably should have grabbed something to eat for lunch, but I was able to get through most of the posts.  Thanks again for all the info I've got a lot of stuff to look into now.  I'll be sure to return here as you guys have all been super helpful.  Thanks for making this subreddit so kick ass*

So one of the big hurdles in getting stereolithography printers up and going in the RepRap community has been the cost of resin to print with. Most places sell for $75+/liter, which is way over the price of PLA/ABS.

I just started www.MakerJuice.com to produce awesome resin at a more affordable price. Right now I am selling on my site for $45/Liter for my first resin. That's a 40% savings over the next closest guys, and my resin is as good or better than anything else out there. I'm also partnering with several stores and people in the RepRap community to develop the resin printing community even more, so I can lower the price in the future.

My hope is with lower cost resin, and better Laser/DLP printers, we can take DIY 3D printing to the next step. So come check out www.MakerJuice.com. I'll be adding more stock as needed, and you can find me in #reprap if you want to talk!

We'd like to announce our contribution to the 3d printing community: We've started a new site for sharing your 3d print models (physibles) with the world. It is user moderated which helps the best physibles bubble up to the top. We have a very large list of features currently in the works, but for now it's a very simple. It's currently in beta, but we wanted to introduce it sooner rather than later. We are currently looking for a few community members to start posting their models and provide feedback, and we wanted to announce here to generate interest. Let us know what you think. Thanks!

I had a play around using Dichloromethane to smooth out the PLA post print.

The print was OK to begin with - took a while to clean up as it was covered in support and my retract settings were not perfect - which lead me to have a play with dipping the model in Dichlo.

Hopefully the results speak for themselves! He has lost his brightness, and gone a more pastel and matte finish.

Bear in mind that the Dichlo is crazy bad for you and everyone around you - and all H&amp;S precautions should be taken if using the chemical! :)

Anyone had any experience with the 1x2?  
  
also i was going to say if anyone's planning on making a gen7 board and needs the components then i could package together all the bits which farnell sell on this http://reprap.org/wiki/Generation_7_Electronics#Parts_Lists for you, it just cost me £50 for a little over x5 so i'd expect it'll work about about £10ish including uk postage and a few quid more to reach the US.  You'd still need all the Connectors &amp; Miscellaneous plus the bread board, etc obviously but it might be easier than finding the components in small numbers.

First, we implemented what we call Stash. This is a favoriting feature. You can find the My Stash link on the left where you can view all of the things you have stashed. On the physible page, clicking on the star icon next to the title will stash it.

The second thing is that we tweaked the popularity algorithm. Previously, it was weighted way too heavily on date.

We've also tweaked the physible model rendering a bit and added the ability to render any model you uploaded (not just the first one). As well as some minor UI tweaks.

We will continue to add features as fast as possible. Thanks for looking.

After shopping around a little bit for a Prusa kit, I decided to source the majority of parts from Mixshop. I placed my order, the card was charged, and the status was displayed as ""processing"".

That was late one Friday night. So late most would consider it a Saturday.

Monday rolled around, and I was anxiously awaiting a shipment notification. The store page had listed 15 kits in stock, so I didn't expect any delays.

Then Tuesday rolled around, and Wednesday, and Thursday. Friday morning I sent them a message using their site's built-in Contact Us form with an estimated 24 hour turnaround, even on weekends.

Hearing nothing but static, I sent a hard email Saturday afternoon.

Finally, on Tuesday, I received a reply from MixShop stating that they were waiting on their RAMPS supplier. I guess that ""15 in stock"" means ""15 in stock, but missing parts so we can't ship them.""

Today, I bit the bullet and sent an email requesting that they cancel my order. Just over 15 minutes later, I get a human reply back acknowledging my cancellation request and stating that they will refund the charge to my card. At least they can get something right and prompt.

A minute later, I get an automated notification saying that my order has shipped. Checking on their site, I see that my order's status is ""shipped"" with the comment ""Awaiting customer refund"".

Mixed messages. Great.

As soon as I'm confident that my order is *actually* cancelled, I will be ordering from MakerFarm.

I've also been PMing /u/InTheBay, who is going through a similar ordeal. They apparently told him that they will be able to ship ""everything, sans electronics... next week.""

Anyway, I'm a student looking something to do other than gaming and eating my life away.

I discovered the reprap project after a TIL was posted by another redditor.

It seemed like a good idea as a start to 3D printing (I always had a thing for plastic shapes, if you know what I mean), and thought that a self-replicating 3D printer would be a good hobby.

I know how expensive it would be to make a reprap, but again, it would be something that I would like to do for fun.

I have read the reprap blog and many tutorials on it and would like to build the Iteration 2 prusa mendel printer.

I'm looking into eventually buying printed parts.

I recently decided to tackle building my own machine and started browsing the various RepRap versions. I was watching a video of a 3D printer in action when this moment of inspiration hit me!

See - I work for a copier dealer. We sell big commercial equipment that runs at high speed with heavy paper stock and is designed to run for well over a million pages. It occured to me that the system that moves the light bar in our copiers is VERY similar to the parts needed for the X/Y axis on a 3D printer like the cartesio. These light bars have to move with the same kind of accuracy as a 3D print head in order to scan at high resolution. I feel like there's a possibility to build a pretty large machine as some of our scanning beds are as large as 12""x18"". And that's just the axis drive! These machines are packed with stepper motors, auger drives, motor driver boards, thermistors, timing controllers, miles of wiring, lots of fancy little connectors, bearings/rollers and of course a big touch screen display wouldn't be a bad thing right?

My boss gave me the ok to pull a couple of our old machines off to a corner in the warehouse and use them for scavenging purposes so I'm starting to work on figuring out what will actually be usable and planning my build. I'm curious if anyone has any experience with this type of scenario. Have you ever pulled parts from a copier? Any recommendations on firmware/controller hardware?

1. There's a ton of 3d printers out there.
2. There's a ton of technologies out there.

So, consider this market research.  Everyone in this forum has, likes, or wants a 3d printer.  And I want to know:
1. Why?
2. Who are you?

Why -- I guess this is, ""What drives you to buy a 3d printer.  What elements motivate you the most about it?"" ( some examples of what I might mean: Technology -- e.g. 'I really like SLS in polymaide-12!'; Design -- e.g. 'I really like the ease of use in the makerbot replicator 2'; Business -- e.g. 'I want to sell printed art objects'; Misc factors -- e.g. 'i'm really interested in a cheap robot', or, ' I really want something made in America'; Other factors -- e.g. 'You haven't thought of X.  I want X.')

Who are you -- Age, Sex, education, interests -- my blog stats and make faire experience shows me some of this.  Male, either near college aged or middle aged, with above average intelligence and a strong desire to be on the cutting edge of tech seems to be the norm of who I meet.  I'd love to hear from people who don't normally talk to me.  When I worked a booth at Maker Faire, I noticed that few women stopped by, but lots of machinists and engineering students.  MakerBot had a larger demographic -- so I'm really interested in understanding why.

I guess other questions I have are, ""Where, how, when, how often"".  For example, where -- 'I run my printer in the Garage, since the Wife thinks it's too big for the house.'

How/when-'I use it on a Mac overnight, unattended.'

How often -- 'I print every day!'.

I could use a survey monkey and provide radio button options -- but I really want to hear, in detail, what you all want.  If someone else says exactly what you wanted to say, please upvote them.  This gives me some sense of how many people feel the same way.

Thanks!

I am considering getting a 3d printer for making small prototype parts at work.  I have been digging around the reprap wiki and talking to some folks on the irc channel and they recommend that a Kit is best for the first foray into the field.

I am currently looking at:

Makerbot Replicator
Ultimaker
RapMan Ultimate 
3d Touch Ultimate 

I am planning on going with something that has a double head for now.  My main concerns are the resolution of the final product, speed it can make the print, ease of maintenance,  and usability in case other people besides myself need to use it.

I am planning on using this to make a reprap for myself later on so I hope that I am not too far out of bounds by posting this here.  Does anyone have feedback on which kit is the best?

Thanks in advance!

Its the first step in mechanising an Equatorial Mount that I am working on. I have lots of other things to do, but this was a discrete part that I could model and build without needing other parts first. 

I was completely blown away by how easy the Sketchup process was. I'm running Ubuntu, and I have to say, finding a working walkthrough of a wine based install, and finding / install the STL converter took longer than the modelling itself. 

I'm very pleased to finally have used the printer for the purpose I wanted it - to make parts for various electro / software projects I'm working on. It really feels like I've turned a corner this weekend. I've pulled various models off thingverse to augment my printer / make ""something"". But this is a step change for me. Its not beautiful, its probably of no use to anyone else, but it is exactly what I intended to make. So its perfect. 

My endless thanks to all of you who have helped me get this far, really, I'd still be staring at piles of ooze feeling sad where it not for many of great posters in here. Thank you. 

I'm still pretty buzzing that I had an idea this morning, and 5 hours later (including 2 x 1.5 hour print times), I have a functional piece in my hand. Its both mindblowing, and exactly what these things are made for.

So here is the question, has anyone had experience sourcing the parts cheaper than this? How much cheaper were you abel to get your Prusa kit for? 

I am trying to decide if it's worth sourcing, which feels a bit like a hassle for me, though for a few hundred dollars I would be willing to do it. If it's less than a hundred dollars saved, probably not worth it to me. Ill pay for the connivance of the kit. 

If you did source your printer, where did you end up finding the best deals on each of the parts?

I am also not really keen on making the electronics board, so that will need to be pre-assembled for me, at least to start. If I can get the printer working to my standards, then I might branch off to make my own boards in the future, since I was able to find some pretty cheap board kits as well.

It seems like a lot of people are using cheap chinese LM8UU bearings that they aren't happy with, and I'm just wondering if these would be at least as good if not better than those.  Given the reprap inclination to prefer printed parts wherever possible, I'm suspicious because I don't see more of them.

Also I'm curious if teflon lubricants would work well on a printed bearing (PLA).

But of course, we've run into the all-too-stated dilemma: which printer to start with? We are currently considering derivatives of the Mendel, Prusa, and Rostock. We are looking for a printer with a lot of support, upgrade able, state-of-the art, and of course relatively cheap and easy to make. We do have a hackerspace nearby, so machining some aluminum parts might be possible, but I've never done anything like that before..

Here are the models we are considering:

Mendel: We're looking at the MendelMax or Mendel90. The later model seems to be recommended most as a first build at the moment.

Prusa: I hear everyone complaining about the threaded rods.. but they certainly are popular. We're looking at the i3.

Rostock: sexy delta printing!! Seriously though, the reduced weight of the moving parts must make a difference. I dont think they have quite the support that Prusa or Mendel has, but Reprap wiki has a good write up and I dont hear about flaws too often (might just be because a lack of information though). Looking at the Kossel, Rostock, or Rostock Max.

Did I miss any? Also, my friend and I will be building two identical printers, so hopefully that will make troubleshooting with each other much easier.

Is it possible to build the RepRap parts from paper parts (Sketchup + Pepakura) which are then hardened with some strong resin?

I know this sounds a bit like overkill, but I am trying to build my first 3d printer on a budget (as low as I can get) and with it to build proper components for a real one :)

I also have some spare steppers, two Arduino Uno's and (soon to come) two Raspberry Pi boards. So I will try to make it work with those.

I've been experimenting a bit with large heated print beds.  So far, I've found heating them is easy with some ATV hand warmers from Amazon.  I'm using Aluminum plate from onlinemetals as my print bed.  I'm looking for something flatter, yet still cheap, and around 12""x12"" in size.  This stuff is probably about .3mm in flatness, +-.

I've looked at Borosilicate glass -- it's about $50 for a 1/8"" thick 12""x12"" plate.  It's also got an error of +- 0.2mm ( so 0.4mm from peak to valley ).  

+-0.2mm is too much error -- I use a really thin nozzle, and the bed flatness from peak to valley shouldn't exceed 0.1 mm.

It makes keeping good bonds a pain in the ass right now.

I'm looking for a good way to get a good printing bond for less than $50.  I've also thought about creating electronics -- a proximity sonar sensor, for example, to compensate in software.  But so far, I haven't solved the problem.  A touch probe is out -- too expensive as far as I can tell.

Anyone got any thoughts on how to solve this problem?  I'd really like ""fire and forget"" prints working.  Maybe something that's not too hard to remove when done?

Thanks!

I've loaded the [RAMPS1.4 test firmware](http://reprap.org/wiki/File:RAMPS14_test.zip)

I've set the currents, and all steppers are working perfect in all directions. So that means electrically I'm good.

Now. I've loaded Sprinter into the Arduino, and I started up Pronterface. Connection is good.

Here's the problem. I hit +10X and it moves. I hit +10Y and it moves. I hit -10X. Nothing. And every X command either forwards or backwards doesn't work after it bugs out like this. Until I reset the Arduino.

Z works fine up and down.

Here's the other problem. It's not consistent. I had all 3 axis working fine one night. Power down for the night. Load it up in the morning, and it's doing it again.

Sometimes it's X, sometimes it's Y. It's usually the negative command that causes it to bug out. Sometimes it's the positive command.

I think the issue is either Pronterface or Sprinter, and something related to the missing end-stops.

Does anyone know how to make them ignore endstops for testing purposes?

**PROBLEM FIXED : Thanks ScribbleJ**

&gt; In the firmware config, set the endstops to inverting and set the end stop pullups to true. You'll be fine.
Without endstop pullups, the signal will float and can trigger or not, randomly.

What happened is when I couldn't get the axis to move at all in one direction, I changed the pullups to false, and that got them working 'intermittently'. 

Now that I put them back to true AND inverted the endstop inputs as suggested by ScribbleJ, it works perfect.

I was going to make a derivative of the MendelMax 1.5, then I saw the 2.0, and finally I figured instead of ""cloning"" somebody else's idea (even though it is open source), I figured I would get much more appreciation of my machine by designing it myself. 

So I decided to model my own RepStrap. I will be using extruded aluminum, and make the other frame components out of aluminum mostly. 

I started figuring out a proper design, and the first things I started to consider were how to move the extruder or heated bed. There are 3 axis (obviously), and two components that must move relative to each other, the extruder and build platform (again, obviously). How to move these is up to the designer. 

I came to the conclusion I would like the build platform to move in only the Z direction. What is the reason the more popular RepRaps such as the Prusa Mendel and the Mendel Max have the extruder move on the x and z axis, while having the build platform move on the y axis?

I've not been able to calibrate the hot end no thermometer... - it gets hot and melts, I'm just not sure if the temp it says its getting to is the temp it is. 

I've read loads of great tips and tricks - I'm running the bed 60 degrees (uncalibrated, as above), and painting the glass overlay with a PLA/Acetone mix. 

My prints are coming up wispy - in that the first layer is fine, but the next few get finer and loose any decent form, I've tried different layer heights, temps, and I've not got much further than this rough layering after the bottom. 

I'm also using a Wades extruder, and I suspect that the hobbed bolt is not great. A few times the extruder has blocked halfway through a print. I'm not sure if its a general thermal issue that I need to address, or a result of incorrect extrusion feed speeds...

My plan with this is to use my raspberry pi as the computer, which can be mounted on the RR itself. then use the GPIO on the Pi to control a small LCD screen and a couple of buttons.

I have a few things I need help with though:

a) I need a program or app with which I can use PHP to talk to the RAMPS controller. I know quite a bit of PHP so this is the easiest for me.

also, python resembles PHP a bit (I've only looked at it a little) so that is also a possibility.


b) what controls should I add to the interface, after the LCD screen I only have 4 pins left, so 4 buttons are possible.

however i did think of something else: this might be better suited for an RP programmer but I might use somthing like the following:

pin 1 = A

pin 2 = B

pin 3 = C

pin 4 = D

pin 1&amp;2 = E

pin 1&amp;3 = F

pin 1&amp;4 = G

pin 2&amp;3 = H .. etcetera.

Im thinking of having at least 5 buttons: +, -, next, back and reset.

The headless part of this would be programmed like this: Every setting is diplayed on the top line with the value on the bottom line so:

    Extruder *C
    230 *C

pressing + or - will set the higher or lower temp and pressing next or back will change which settings are changed.

the different options I want to be able to be changed are:

X speed (+ makes the axis move gradually faster to the right, - slows down until stopped and then moves backwards) Displaying position possibly?

Y speed

Z speed

Extruder speed

Extruder temp

bed temp

gcode file select (+ changes, - selects)

Home (+ &amp; - do home)

Power (+ = reset, - = turn off)


any suggestions for other functions?

The main thing I want to know is if there is a REALLY simple console program just to connect to the reprap and send/receive gcode.

I will keep you guys posted with more info about my progress.
Eventually some gcode interpreter will pop up here ( http://piotography.zapto.org/ ) as well

I'd like to get the best quality prints possible so I'm going to skip the Prusa, even though the Makergear kit does produce some very high quality prints. My primary goal is print quality, but desk space (I live in an apartment, so it has to be as small as possible) and price are also a consideration.   

I've narrowed it down to 3 repraps that I'm interested in:     

**Mendel90:** This is a good option in terms of a strong rigid frame that is easy enough to build. Not bad looking. I'd expect to produce some good quality prints with such a rigid frame.     

**Rostock Delta:** I just love the way this thing looks. Delta geometry is simply a whole new world of Cartesian location that I'm very interested in seeing developed. However I have some serious concerns about print quality. It's going to be very hard to eliminate backlash on those long spindly arms. This design is also too new for there to be enough first hand usage data for me. I'm not seriously considering building this reprap, but I'm keeping it in the front of my mind for now.    

**Tantillus:** I'm seriously considering going with a Tantillus. The guy who designed it and is producing kits lives about 10 minutes from my house, so that is a huge advantage in that I can just show up at the local reprap users group meet up and get help with any problems I'm having. The desk space is the smallest of all the options I'm considering, a huge bonus. The print quality and Z resolution they are getting is simply amazing. I have 2 concerns. The drive system is really, really brilliant, however I'm concerned that the monofilament  drive ""belt"" that he uses is going to eat itself apart being wrapped 5 times around the shaft like that. Replacing those monofilament lines is going to be a pain in the ass. I am also concerned about slippage since the grip on the shaft is ""friction"" and not a toothed belt. This is what gives them such high resolution and low back-lash, but I'm concerned it could also be problematic as the belt wears. Secondly the design is so new there is not a lot of real-world usage. People have gotten their kits in the mail by this point and are building away, but it's going to be some time before we see printers that have printed a few pounds of plastic and users who can give it a fair assessment.     

So I don't know if I should go with the tried and tested Mendel90, or jump on the Tantillus train, or wait a bit longer to see how these new printers shake down before spending a lot of time, effort and money on building a printer.

I think the way to do it would be to copy [this](http://urobotics.urology.jhu.edu/projects/PneuStep/) pneumatic stepper motor design or come up with something similar not under their patent. A pump that you can add a single motor to should be easily printable, or I suppose you could even design a crappy little steam engine to power it and print it out of polycarbonate or something else with a high enough glass transition temperature if you wanted to go really crazy. Control would probably have to be tiny little solenoids attached to printed valves, since the commercial equivalent is too expensive. DIYing the solenoids and going with the ridiculous steam power option would replace every motor in the printer with magnet wire, small springs, a little iron or steel (perhaps in the form of nails?), a heating element and plastic tubing and a bunch of printed parts.

I'm a game designer and artist, and something like this would be incredibly useful to me, so much that I am putting a little money aside so that I may be able to purchase the parts in the near future (~3 months). Before I make any final decisions, I have a batch of questions to ask. I understand there's plenty of links, but as of right now, there's a lot of technical aspects that I haven't read up on, so if they could be answered in plain English while I catch up on the learning curve between now and the time I get the printer, I'd be very agreeable with that.

* What file format does the printer accept? Is there any special setup required to modify a file so that the reprap can use it?
* Is the lower bound of printing size limited by the print head or by the software? What is this lower bound typically found to be?
* With a novice level of understanding electronics but a high level of understanding of software and programming, how difficult would it be to set the device up once the parts are acquired?
* How fragile are the constructed pieces? Is it directly related to the stock material used or is it weakened by the means of creation?
* Say you were printing a 1 inch solid cube, how long would that take to print for the cheapest model reprap? The most expensive?
* How easy is it to repair if the device malfunctions or breaks?
* And what are the minimum specifications to have for the computer that the device is hooked up to? Could an old desktop be used to run the software, or does it need more modern specs?
* Are any of you using the device to make any money? Is it ethical to use this device to make money?

Sorry if most of this can be answered in the faq, I just like reading answers that are less technical, more casual. I'll be reading up, and trying to make a decision on which model of reprap that I would like to use for my projects.

I am a fairly young (and broke) college student who has been following 3D printing for quite a while now.  I would LOVE to have a really nice 3D printer, but I don't have tens of thousands of dollars...

Anyways, my question: I really want to get a 3D Printer, but I don't have a lot of money to spare.  I haven't done a ton of research yet, but from what I saw complete RepRap kits (whatever the newer model was, I can't remember) were going for close to $800.

I have absolutely 0 issues with building one myself, but obviously my concern is money. I also have experience soldering circuit boards and such. Basically I have all the tools listed on the wiki page and am confident in building it.

Is there a way I can build a RepRap myself for less than $300?  It's entirely possible I would have $500-600 leftover this summer I can spend, but I would prefer to do this with as low a cost as possible.

Doesn't need to be super fancy or big, but I would love the project and would really love being able to print stuff.

Anyone have any ideas/tips/advice on how to do this (if it's possible)?  I saw the Print It Forward subreddit (fantastic idea btw), but it wasn't very active and I need more advice than that.

For those of you have have a RepRap, what did it cost?  If you built it yourself, how hard was it to build and acquire parts, and how much did that cost?

Also, I didn't really look for it and it just occured to me, but how much does it cost to use and how long does it take to print? (These are minor concerns unless it costs like $10 to print a fork)

I realize this post isn't super well written, sorry.

By asking in the IRC channel, they said it's my power supply the problem. But this power supply is already working with another RepRap ( a orginal H-1 Seemecnc with the CNC board)

By asking the forums (Reprap/Seemecnc), they said it's the wiring of the motors. So I wired like they said, but it's not working.

1340102643.0,10,self.Reprap,v9rh4,My (bad) experience with mendel-parts.com Pruso v0.3,packadal,10,0,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Reprap/comments/v9rh4/my_bad_experience_with_mendelpartscom_pruso_v03/,"Rant warning : I have been struggling with my orca the whole morning, and finally understood what was wrong, and I'll need to buy a new belt.

Mendel-parts.com seduced me because they advertised an ikea-like 3D printer. While I understood it was not yet finished, and would still be quite a bit of work, I ordered my orca 0.3. This was august 10 2011.
The website advertised a shipping time of at least 3 to 5 weeks, so I only began to worry about what was happenning to my printer about two months after I ordered (there was no communication from them, and the payment had been processed).
I called, and was told my printer would ship by the end of the week. Yay !
I was retty happy because I was planning to move at that time, and would have loved to have my printer before, as I would be too busy after. I did not receive my printer until one more month had passed (it shipped december 30th), and when the printer shipped I saw an annoucement on the website about version 0.4.

I had followed the news a bit before ordering, and saw that people who had ordered v0.2 just before v0.3 was release had an option to switch to the newest version. 
I was pretty angry that I did not have such an option, and at no point before release was the fact that a new version was under development advertised.
But what pisses me off even more is that while he was supposed to work on shipping my printer, he was developping a new model. This would have been ok if my printer had been a couple of weeks late, but it was over four months after I ordered that it was shipped instead of 3 to 5 weeks.

Anyways, when I received my printer, I was working on the house I bought, and only recently had I time to start working on the printer.

The beginning of the build went pretty well, except there was no download link on the orca 0.3 page for the manual, and I did not receive a printed copy as was advertised.

Up until page 22  everything was fine, then the instructions manual is clearly not finished. There are empty pages, drawing half outside the page and such. [http://www.mendel-parts.com/downloads/manuals/Manual-Orca-v030-PDF/0_FULL_Orca-030-assembly-manual-v01.pdf](see for yourself).

So I misunderstood how the X-axis belt should be placed and cut it too short. This was after quite a bit of time trying to stick the belt between two washers, which is pretty fucking hard as the damn belt always moves away when tightening.

So far, after talking to a lot of my friends both online and in town, it's dawned on me that a lot of people would love to have custom made physical items. So much so, that people were willing to hand me money right then an there. I told them not to, until I got a cost breakdown.

I've been looking at the Prusa Mendel, and liking both the size, the support and the relative simplicity it actually has. I've got a computer that I can dedicate already, and I've noticed that after looking at the Bill of Materials on the wiki, it seems to me that a few places that offer complete kits tend to be around $600. Is it foolish to want to acquire a complete kit, or is it advised for a person's first reprap to farm out their own parts?

Basically, from what I'm looking at, it seems that farming out the pieces could cut costs, but would it be better to buy a kit just so I don't have to worry about my own stupidity and shipping costs from multiple different places?

I've walked myself through the assembly page twice now, and think I have a pretty good understanding of that, so I'm not worried I'll break parts, I'm not much of a stranger to programming either, and I've been vastly improving my 3D design skills to actually make my own schemas, I've been reading up everywhere, learning everything I can, and I think I'm confident enough to actually start this.

So, the TL;DR version is summed up with these two questions:

* Does $600 sound about right for the total costs of a Prusa Mendel Bill of Material?
* Is it better to buy a kit and have everything I need, or is it better to try to buy the pieces separately?",,False,self,t5_2qq91,False,,,True,t3_r606o,http://www.reddit.com/r/Reprap/comments/r606o/startup_costs_and_getting_started/,

Also, should I be wary of buying a completed model off of ebay if I could snag it for cheapish ($200~$300). My experience with electronics is poor, but I'm very versed in software knowledge.

That said, I want to thank everybody who helped me out in my topic last month, it was very helpful to get that sort of information. Now that I've got some funds I don't want to just make a fool out of myself by getting too excited and buying before I understand fully what's all going on.

So I'm looking for cheap, and I don't need a very big build area for the projects I have in mind. Where would I find a breakdown of all the model's parts costs, and where would I be able to then find said parts. I know the reprapping community is very fond of 'print it forward', something I think is a fantastic idea and I'll definitely be doing that myself when the time comes, so I keep hearing that the costs for the various printable parts are quite low.

Never printed, so not sure whether Kapton tape comes off easily, is supposed to come off at all, or if it's scraped off, or otherwise.

We also now have an official PhysibleExchange logo: an abstract representation of a physible being exchanged. There were some smaller changes as well. For example, some complained about the horizontal scrollbar appearing too early. That's been fixed.

I can print stuff, but sometime generally around the 5th or 6th layer the corners start to curl up.  This causes the next few layers to get kinda smooshed over the curl, and eventually the curl gets high enough that the extruder just whacks the whole object out of where it's supposed to be.  This basically means that I can only make objects that are less than a few millimeters high, which kinda defeats the whole purpose.

I'm currently using [this PCB heatbed](http://www.lulzbot.com/en/14-heated-print-bed.html) and printing with PLA through a .5mm nozzle.  I've tried the bed at 5 degree increments between about 25C and 60C, I can't seem to make it get any hotter than that.  Pretty much nothing seems to help, if I try to print anything of a reasonably height it just seems to get screwed up.

I'm wondering if anyone else has had this problem, and if so, how did you resolve it?  How do I make my prints stick to the surface?

Edit on my results in case anyone with a similar problem finds this thread in the future.  Here's what I tried:
 
1) Mouse ears - This mostly worked, though the ears themselves would peal off.  Overall kinda a frustrating solution, as I had to go back into all my models and add ears, it took slightly longer to print, and I'd have to cut the ears off at the end.  Still, usually kept the stuff down.

2) Flipping the bed so that the warning text is facing down - Seemed to make a slight difference in that things stuck a little longer, but still didn't give me enough heat to keep anything down for a significant amount of time.

3) Blue painter's tape - This was the solution for me.  As noted by peepsalot this completely changed my problem so that now my issue is getting things off the bed, which isn't too tough with a razor, and frankly after having every damned thing peel for a week feels kinda great.  Awesome suggestion, also dirt cheap to implement.

4) Checking the actual voltage that my bed is getting - turns out it's actually 12v, or close enough.  Kinda feeling like either the heatbed design is sucky, or mine is just bad.

Anyways, thanks for the  tips, everyone.

I work in the networking industry and it struck me that cat5 cable might make a pretty interesting option. It is really easy to come by as scrap and really easy to make/terminate with the right tools. 
For those not totally familiar: This is the generic ethernet cable seen everywhere. The cable is 8 copper wires (stranded or solid) with 4 pairs that are twisted together, impedance is 50 ohm. Power over ethernet specs require max 57V or .6A on each wire.  
My idea would be to put each stepper conductor wire on each pair (4 each). To do this I would make a small PCB with a screw terminal on one end (for stepper wires) and a cable jack on the other. For the electronics ends I would think to make a small board with a jack and 4 male headers to interface with the controller board. 
I gave a single strand 2.5A at work without any sign of heating up and only .4V. I think it could be really cool and clean and wanted to share the idea and see if anyone had done something similar.

Easy to connect/disconnect
Single cable for each axis (organization)

I am currently trying to decide between printrbot+, prusa interation 2, and mendelmax as my very first 3d printer (links above). Unfortunately, I do not currently have a 3d printer, otherwise I would likely print out the mendelmax parts which are currently unavailable to buy from what I gather. I previously decided against the original printrbot because of the smaller build area. I don't think I would have any trouble putting any of these machines together. For me, it's more a matter of having to source all of the parts, making sure they're all compatible / I don't get the wrong thing, etc. The floating y-axis on the printrbot+ sort of scares me a bit. Will that contribute to lower quality prints? Quality is of high priority for me. After I'm not a n00b anymore, I plan to get into smaller nozzle sizes (0.25-0.35) and [microlayering](http://vimeo.com/32689671).

I also have a NEMA23 (13kg-cm, 0.25"" shaft) that needs a 20:1 or greater reduction.

What about the ooze? is that less of an issue these days? What about the slicer settings, Vids i've looked at seem to have a massive retraction and high speed?...

I've been up (and down) printing for about a week now and I figured I would post some of my issues and see if you know any fixes or what I need to do it up right.

A little bit about my machine:
Prusa i2 with ABS parts
Ramps 1.4
Marlin Firmware
SAE
3 mm PLA Filament
.35 mm J head hot end
printing onto an 8*10 picture frame I had lol

And my slic3r settings:
Temp: 200 with 210 first layer
Print speed of 30 with +- 10 for small perimeters and infill
Layer height: .2 mm and a .5 ratio for first layer height


Problems:

* Tools - I'm not a handy man... and calling my tool selection thin is generous.  I had to buy calipers, metric hex wrenches (despite ordering SAE), and a soldering iron.  I improvised here and there, using a wrench for crimpers... which I then had to go back and just solder after it broke.

* Building -  Cracked a linear bearing holder but it managed to stay so far, the wood pieces for keeping the heated bed off the screws were laser cut and broke weird when I pulled them out so they are slightly different heights, the nut holders were too small in a few cases which as a true noob proved more confusing than I'd like to admit.

* Calibration.  I'm using a mechanical end stops and I swear it never is in the exact same place twice for the z axis.  I have to scrap about 2 out of 3 of my first prints because that all important first layer doesn't get put down correctly. When I finally do get it situated right, something happens where I have to tweak something so I have to re calibrate. 

* Smooth Rods - my smooth rods are already developing some gouges in them where I guess the linear bearings are tearing into them.  I think I'm gonna have to replace both the rods and the linear bearings with some higher quality ones.

* ~~Y endstop~~ **Fixed**-  all my other endstops work fine, but not Y. Y appears as though it is always pressed. It was working temporarily then spontaneously went down again.

* The top layers would kind of drift off the base of my print, on good prints it was like the leaning tower and on bad prints it would be a ball of yarn. Since, I've fixed with more clips holding my glass stationary.

* The small Gear  -**4/11 biggest problem, still unfixed** My small gear broke a tooth, rendering it completely useless. I had (luckily) printed off one before; however, due to before mentioned calibration issues, it turned out deformed. The nut inside this deformed gear just spun instead of tightening on the stepper motor shaft, so I tried turning the large gear by hand trying to print a new one with predictable results. Desperate, I took a lighter and essentially melted the bolt in place. This worked just long enough to print a very good looking small gear. However, now the stepper motor shaft just spins inside the new gear once it gets hot... (The grub screw is in place... had that problem before already too :-P) I'm thinking about taking off this gear and squirting some glue in it. Any reason not to do that?

It's been really interesting to work on, but I'm ready to print consistently! Any advice, tips, or encouragement are more than appreciated!

Edit: **Today's Problem (4/12)** MINTEMP error, trying to find the problem led me to the thermistor. I noticed a wire wasn't attached correctly.  Trying to get the plastic sleeves right against the glass and pop... I broke it. And since I ordered a kit I have no idea which one I need or how to find it. Sigh...

Original Post:


Hello everyone. I have been building for a couple of months now, but I have run into a few problems. All and any help would be much appreciated. (This is my last resort, I have been scouring interwebs for a month or so :()

Firstly, I'm pretty sure I shorted my stepper motor drivers. They aren't brown or anything, but they just don't work, where a few of them did work a couple of days ago. I ordered new ones, and that brings me to my first question. 
Is there any way, using a DMM or any other equipment/indicators to test if they're operational? I have a feeling a few of them might be.

The second question is regarding the Molex pins and connectors that socket the wires into ramps. Seeing as I bought an electronics kit at once, I do not know the name of the individual parts. Does anyone happen to know where I can order the crimp pins and terminals that slot into ramps. (Is [this](http://www.hobbytronics.co.uk/crimp-conn-housing-2) and [this](https://www.google.ca/search?q=crimp+pin&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:unofficial&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;channel=fflb&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=GfECUZyYJuaNyAGdl4DoDg&amp;biw=1846&amp;bih=966&amp;sei=HvECUf7GKebLyAHM4YDYBA#imgrc=gyVUD6mYef4GTM%3A%3B_iDMdTQVf7F48M%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.alpha-crucis.com%252F3993-7211-thickbox%252Fcrimp-pins-for-female-housing-pins-ph254.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.alpha-crucis.com%252Fen%252Fconnectors-en%252F3993-crimp-pins-for-female-housing-pins-ph254-3700386609107.html%3B600%3B600) the right stuff??)
That being said, I don't know the right sizing or  diameter or anything! A direct link to a store in the US or Canada would be most beneficial!

Thirdly, due to the fact that I connected everything without much confidence, I have no idea whether my ramps 1.4 board is working. Is there anyway that I can test the board itself so I don't have to fry more drivers? 

aannd finally, does anyone know of a really good build guide that goes over all the electronics in detail?

Sorry for the long post, and thank you for reading.

All help is very much appreciated!

Thanks

Pics of the first two cubes here, printed with 3mm filament, 0.5 nozzle at 30mm/s using slic3r and marlin firmware.  The bottom 5mm looks great, then things seem to get a little squirrelly.  I was having issues with my z-axis not sliding great because of warped x-ends so I'm wondering if it might be slightly sticking after about 5mm above the bed. I'm going to keep digging through the forums but I'm open to advice.

EDIT: also I was printing white ultimaker PLA at 190º

UPDATE: after the helpful comments and some more internet reading it looks like I'm just having a problem with heat because the layers don't have time to cool and the thin walls can be finicky too.  I did the same cube with infill as the next test in the calibration and it came out great.  Maybe just a tiny bit of wobble in my z axis which is strange since I'm using the metal couplings and precision lead screws, though I do find the aluminum clamp couplings don't hold the leadscrew dead straight.

Still going to tune my extruder steps and make sure my filament size is correct to see if that gets me even better prints.

http://www.mixshop.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=24&amp;products_id=94

And this plastics kit:
https://nwreprap.com/prusa/

After getting everything(extremely quick turnaround on plastics from NW Reprap), and extremely slow and painful turnaround from Mixshop(I'll put my rant about them at the bottom for anyone interested), I realized that neither kit came with pulleys or z-axis couplers.  I found the couplers in the US and hopefully those will be in by the end of the week, but I am having trouble finding pulleys in the US.  The only reason I want US, is that I don't want to wait another month just for 2 parts.

So, does anyone know where I can order the pulleys from in the US? I am assuming that I need the standard 16 tooth.  Any help is much appreciated.


Anywho, here is my rant against mixshop.  After ordering because the parts said in stock, I wait a week with no movement on the order, finally after contacting them directly, they decided to ship out my order.  Good, ""Guaranteed delivered by July 2nd""............ya, not even close. After sitting in customs or something for an entire week, I call UPS, and then Mixshop, and then mixshop does whatever was needed to get it through to the US. Ok, a week later again, and finally the parts show up last night. (woohoo!)  Box looks like it had been a soccerball while it was in limbo.  And of course, electronics damaged.  Oh, and to top it all off, when UPS finally showed up last night with it, they charged me $68 just to get the package.... I had already paid shipping to mixshop, but apparently that didn't include fee's to get it to the US or something.  The whole process from them was a giant pain in my ............  &lt;/rant&gt;


**tl;dr: Where can I get pulleys in the US??**


**UPDATE**
Well, after searching for a while, and pricing it all out at sdp-si.com (thanks /u/ScribbleJ), I ended up just sending an email to NWReprap.com to see if they would just sell the belts and pulleys as a kit to me.  I got an email back within a few minutes, and have the parts ordered now, for quite a bit cheaper than if I were to order them directly(naturally).

Is it OK to leave a printer of this sort to print unsupervised between meetings?
Would we have any trouble building collaboratively, or is the build process easy to split up among club members?

I've noticed the number of folks just about to start building Prusa's, or considering their first printers.  I'd like to introduce EasyRap!  It's my own design on a 3d printer. It's still a work in progress, and Alpha-1 ( the first protoptype bot )is not yet complete.

http://ipeerbhai.wordpress.com/

I designed this after getting frustrated with the complexity of my Prusa.    All axes of motion have been built at this time, and they all work as designed.  The Cantelever is strong enough to hold a few pounds -- more than enough for a couple of extruders.  

Here are some of the features that I think people will like:

Tool head changes are super easy -- just change a screw ow two, which I may make into a wing-nuts ( so no tools required ).  It'll be the fastest tool-head change of all the bots, and can support any number of extruders.  

It's very flexible a design -- you can add Z stages, even turn it into an assembly line.

It's also a very fast build.  Alpha-1 build started @ 3:00 on Saturday, finished to this point @ 8:00.  And that's with printing/laser-cutting/dremelling some parts.  I think if you have all the parts, it's probably a 2 hour build. 

Current print area matches a Prusa, about 200MM cubed.  It can scale to much larger -- I just used Prusa as a size reference, so people can use RAMPS/Marlin with no changes.

I currently believe Alpha-1 of the bot will be complete soon -- probably in a week or two, depending on when my life allows time to work on it next.  If you're about to start a build, may I suggest waiting until EasyRap is complete?  I'll throw it up on KickStarter and sell kits when the design is fully working, and I'd love to get backers a that time.

Thanks for Reading,
Imran",,False,self,t5_2qq91,False,,,True,t3_p3fu9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Reprap/comments/p3fu9/introducing_easyrap/,

Below I have things that I've tried so far to try and fix this. I can't think what else would cause the extra large droplets consistently on the start of each layer. When printing a cube it happens consistently on all four corners. 

Things I've tried so far: 

* Nozzle temp: I've gone from 225-240 C with no noticeable change. 

* Leveling: I have leveled my bed well and a leveling print seems to come out well, so I don't think it's this.

* E calibration: I've marked the filament, extruded a certain amount and then measured once again and compared and my E steps seem to be within a few percent. The measuring process I have used is less accurate then I'd like but it seems to be consistent. 

* Retraction/Z lift: I've tried from 0-1.5 mm retraction and 0-1.5 mm lift and neither have a huge difference. 

If I print a solid layer I get little fringes at the edge of each line of plastic.

When I start a print, after it homes, it spins up a few mm very fast before the print actually starts and I can see the Z axis miss steps and the motors make a funny noise. I think the nozzle being too close to the bed is what's causing the extruder to jam and the uneven rising in the Z axis is why I have a such a hard time leveling my bed. I don't get skipped steps normally, as far as I can tell it's only when I start a print, and then only in the Z axis. 

I feel like my pots are well adjusted, the motors sound good, run well, and don't overheat, so I'm not sure if the voltage is too low. Is there a setting I can adjust when I slice a model to print?

The printed toothed pulley that fixes to the motor shaft doesn't mesh properly with the belt, causing it to occasionally 'pop' as the teeth pop back into place.  

The belt pitch (5mm) seems to be a little too long for the gear, causing it to ride up on the next tooth of the gear rather than mesh with it... then it jumps back into place as the pulley turns further.

Is the solution to replace/modify the pulley, or is there adjustments to be made?  The belt isn't overly tensioned (no tensioner installed yet), but from what I can tell, tensioning the belt further would only stretch the belt and make the meshing problem worse, but maybe that's my problem?

This is a part bloggy thing, part questions - I'll stick the questions at the end so you don't have to read the rest! 

I've been getting OK results in PLA testing (cubes and couple of simple shapes), so I thought I'd see what it made of some ABS I have. 

Having completely messed up the filament change (resulting in a small blob snapping off the thread, and resulting in me having to take the thing apart again to clear it). I decided to strip it down and see how the extruder faired without the hot end attached. I could get some forced extrusion if I manually forced the filament down into the hot end, but it was not extruding freely under its own power. 

Stripped down, it gave me a chance to clean up a few things that had been annoying me. 

* Hex head bolts, and wingnuts on the bolts that connect the x-carriage to the extruder - justification - to get the extruder mech off, I had to remove the extruder motor to get down to the holding bolt. There is no captive slot in the floor, so now I can just hold the hex head bolt with needle nose pliers and spin the wingnut off. When she's fully up and running (ha!) I'll super glue the threads to fix the wings nuts in place. 

* remove the excess main bolt in the extruder. Its fixed on with a nyloc nut, so there is lots of extraneous forceful turning to tighten/remove. I took off about a cm. 

* Address the 2 retaining screws between the hotend and the extruder. This is a really weak link in my build, and the M3 bolts are a huge pain. Cheap soft bolts that are stripping, and in a very annoying place to get too. You have to take off the main extruder cog to get to them, so every time there is a block / issue, the whole gear has to come off. I've re-cut the driver slot for now, and flatten off a couple of sides. The idea is that I can grip the heads behind the main cog and get the off without having to remove the extruder main bolt. I drove all over town looking for M3 35mm hex head bolts with no joy. I have another store I can try tomorrow, but essentially I hit every hardware store in a 40km radius from me, and found nothing suitable. This design should have a captive hole for the retaining bolts. There is plenty of plastic here, and it would make removal of the hotead much much easier. 

* Still on the hotend/extruder coupling. I filed out the holes in the extruder and filed off the groove in the hotend, so the bolts at least slide in without having to be screwed on. This was a huge pain, and something of a limitation. Now they slot together properly, the bolts slide in place, and rely on the bolt pinching to hold in place, not the pseudo thread being tapped by the snug-fit bolt.  

OK - on the main question. 

I assembled the extruder off the printer and wanted to observe the extrusion of any filament. Having hooked the idler back up to the main body, I wanted to check how far the hobbed bolt protudes into the feed channel. Answer - not a great deal. In fact, using ~1.75mm filament I can hand feed without the hobbed bolt touching the filament. This might explain the reason its not extruding cleanly.... 

I have tried to make a hobbed bolt - but I can see its not ideal. I basically cut out slots in the smooth shaft of the bolt - I don't access to a proper shop, and so I can't make a properly hobbed bolt. This it have to do for now unless I can come up with something better. 

As you can see form the pictures, the idler bearing does not make an appearance in the feed channel. I suspect this is part of the problem - if its not in the channel, its not going to be forcing the filament onto the hobbed bolt...      

So my main question is. what should i do about this? I'm very reluctant to start filing off the idler block - without it, I'm really not going to get very far, and I think that filing it down might reduce the structural integrity of the block as it will cut into the perimeter/shell and expose the infill as the main surface. 

Pictures (apols for cellphone quality):

Any suggestions or other experiences? I know I could just get some 3mm filament, but that would mean the 1kg of 1.75mm I currently have is wasted... And I can't be sure that will solve the problem.

I started building my own 3D printer about 2 weeks ago. Well, I guess designing is a more appropriate word for it actually..... But I digress.

The first thing I noticed is that there is a general lack of really concise information out there in regards to designing and building your own printer. Maybe this is just because it is not that common? I don't know really.

I currently own a whole f-ton of domains, so was thinking about turning one into a build blog type of deal. The problem is, I know very little about CSS/HTML/Java etc. I have avoided learning any of that with a passion. I'm not looking to create anything fancy here, just somewhere for me to get information on a page and not have it look like a piece of garbage.

That basically brings me here,
What I'm wondering is if anyone on here would be willing to trade some of the expertise I have, or printed parts, etc. for some of their expertise/work.


Things I'm looking for:

Someone who has a thorough (See: better than my) understanding of electronic circuit design.

Someone who has web-dev experience.


Things I can offer:

CAD work. I use Solidworks.

Mechanical design/engineering.

Non-stamped fabrication drawings.

Printed parts at cost. (Either 16 micron polyjet parts, or parts from my printer once it is up and running.)

Manufactured parts. (Lathed, CNC cut/drilled)



What got me going down this road was I recently had a fellow redditor offer up some electronics help with a SLS laser setup in exchange for help with his mechanical design. 
I would post this in classified or something similar, but I'd like it to remain in the 3dPrinting community as much as possible.

Last night when I was testing my extruder (first build), my nichrome wire caught fire somehow and broke. 

Everything is still fine, except when I connect the thermistor to the T0 port, it reads 2 Celsius. When I heat it up with my hand, it goes up to about 5.

If I short the connection with a screwdriver, T0 reads max temp (~350)

The thermistor still works, because I can connect it to T2, and it reads 23 Celsius fine.

I hope I don't have to get a new Ramps board :(

Do I need to print these? 

Also of concern ~~are~~ is the fact that I am lacking 2x belt clamp nut holders. Are all 4 required? I feel like I have some older Prusa Mendel parts here and just want to make sure I have all the printed parts I need...

I'm hoping to push my luck and try again.

I currently have everything mostly working, in that I can print things and they mostly kinda look like what they're supposed to, but they're far from perfect.  I'm almost positive that this is because I really don't know wtf I'm doing, and I'm hoping to get some help.  What I'd really like is a step by step guide for how to dial in the slic3r's settings and diagnose any mechanical issues I might have, but I haven't been able to find that with Google.

If anyone's feeling especially helpful, here's the problems that I'm having:

1) There are visible gaps in my fill.  After tightening my belts the fill layer goes to the edges, but there are still gaps in it that are large enough that I can see the second layer through them.  I've tried screwing with the nozzle diameter and extrusion multiplier, but all this seems to do is deform the rest of the print.

2) I can't create bridges longer than about 5mm before they start to sag.  For example, when I try to print the ends of the X bar for a Prusa Mendel (which are about 20mm long) I get these saggy lines of crap that pretty much make the whole thing look horrible.  I've tried to lower the speed for bridging, but this doesn't seem to help at all.  I've also screwed with my temperature settings, though I have no idea what I'm doing.  My plastic seems to melt around 170 and doesn't jam up until 230, but I don't know where I want to be between those numbers.

3) When I'm printing something where something pokes out to the side so that there's no direct line of plastic between it and the bed, it curls up.  For example, when I print the extruder block for a Wade's geared extruder, the edge that's on the left always curls up and deforms.  I honestly have no idea how to fix this.

4) My layers seem to go down mostly even and in the same place, but when I print something with a straight edge there always seems to be a couple of layers that stick out, as if they missed by a tiny fraction of a millimeter.  I'm not sure if this is normal or not (I can always fix it after the fact with sandpaper, I guess), but I'm wondering if there's something I can do to reduce or remove the issue.

5) When I print something with a vertical hole that is relatively small (5mm or so), it seems there's always a few layers where the edge goes down lopsided.  I've tried reducing speed, but it seems to just print imperfect circles slower.",,False,self,t5_2qq91,False,,,True,t3_rw1p6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Reprap/comments/rw1p6/looking_for_calibration_tips/,

I'm pretty set on building the Wallace for now (since it's the simplest, and I'm new at these things). I've tried reading the official wiki/building manual, but I got lost pretty fast with all the different definitions and parts; and the building manual was just an imageless list- so I had nothing to grab on when trying to understand.

I have a pretty basic knowledge of electrical circuits (robotics project in high school), but I think it should be enough; English is not my native language, though, and I'm struggling with some of the English names of some of the parts.

Is there a simple guide that even a newbie like me could understand? Something that covers everything with images and sketches that are easy to comprehend? I want to know how these machines work by heart.

Aside from that, what is the best source for the parts needed (motors/rods/bearings I could get from eBay, I guess)? Could you recommend of a trusted source for parts (mainly printed) to be shipped internationally for a fair price?

Compared to the documentation on the Mendel Prusa, the documentation on the Mendel is somewhat brief and doesn’t go into detail. This makes the build a lot harder because the Mendel is more difficult to put together than the Prusa.

I am listing my experiences as I build the Mendel and I will make them available on this website. I’ve already done the Assembly Notes for the X, Y and Z-axis. I hope people will be able to learn from my mistakes and experiences so that their Mendel comes together faster and without any problems.

It seems to need less retraction than the makergear, and oozes less as well.

I recently built a MendelMax printer, Arduino-based, lead screw/linear bearing z-axis, bushing + rod x/y-axis, with a budaschnozzle hot end, glass heated bed with Kapton liner.  Running pronterface with Marlin firmware and an assortment of slicer programs.

I am having quite a bit of trouble getting prints to turn out correctly.  My issue is that I start a print and my layers appear to be going down correctly, however as I move upwards in the z-direction (i.e. as my layers stack) my layers get smaller and smaller until my nozzle is basically dragging through my print instead of laying down new filament.  It's as if the z-axis is not lifting enough or is off by a factor that multiples with the distance traveled??

I thought this might be an issue with my z-axis steppers being in series instead of parallel, but I have tried both configurations and ended up with the same effect.  I also tried swapping my M8 threaded rods with lead screws but has had no effect.  I have also played with settings in my firmware (i.e. steps per MM) w.r.t. the z-axis and haven't been able to solve the issue.  

When I test my x/y/z axes to see if a 10mm move command with pronterface results in a 10-mm movement of the z-axis it is precisely on.  My only thought is that I might be doing using my slicing software incorrectly?? 

Has anyone here had this same issue?  Am I missing the boat on some setting or just going about things in the wrong way?

Thanks...

I have never successfully printed on this printer. As you can see in the pictures below, the printer will print a few layers but will then lose its place and start a layer a few cm to the left of the layer before it. 

It is my best guess that this problem is connected to the fact that I have never ""homed"" the axes. That is, they are calibrated to move the right distance, but the printer does not know where the ends and center of the axes are. How would you suggest I proceed?

I followed a calibration guide and got it printing very nicely for a newb IMO.

I am having an issue now when trying to print a larger print (an arduino mega mount).  Twice now it has missed steps on the X axis and shifted over about 35mm when it was 25% of the way through.  Axis feels smooth/no binding. Just for fun on the 3rd try I rotated the part 90 degrees in slic3r and interestingly after it made it to 75% it then shifted on the Y axis.  

I was thinking it was a heat issue... My motors seem to be fairly hot (I can hold my hand on them for about 3 seconds before I remove it), but the pololu drivers on the ramps stay cool.  The trimpots are only barely turned (maybe 1/8th of a turn)  I would turn them up to send more power to the motors but am concerned about the motor heat.  

When I get home I am going to recheck everything and try again.  Could it be a slicing problem since the shift switched axis when I rotated the part?  The graph display in pronterface doesn't show any shifted layers though.  Let me know if you guys have any ideas.

I have so many questions and thanks to the good people here I found many of the answers I were looking for. Still have a few questions:
im planning to build a rather huge machine, with a printable area of around 900mmx600mmx175mm(3 feet x 2 feet x 0.6 feet). The machine will have a custom made frame of aluminium and be quite heavy(for stability etc).

Since im planning the printer head to be the only moving part, Is it possible to scale up the motors from Nema 14 to Nema 17 or even 23? I understand that they need more power - can that be accomplished by just switching out the power supply or do I need to change the controller aswell?

I want the printer to produce extremely fine prints, so I would like to set it in a way where it would be able to produce layers that are 0.07mm, 0.11mm, 0.2mm and 0.3mm. Can I configure that via the controller myself or should i request that from the controller people?

ABS, PLA and PC are usual materials, but why isint PE(or rather HDPE) preferred? It was a similar melting point to ABS? I'm asking because where I live, there are companies that use HDPE and they have a lot of waste left over - why not extrude that myself and keep my machine running longer :)


Thats it for now, If you could fill me in on these questions, I would be a very happy camper !

I will ofcourse share my machine design here and also post technical details and/or youtube videos

For a while now i've wanted to get into the reprap community, build a reprap and start printing stuff.  My first time experience with one was at Fubar Labs back when they were in the basement of a comic shop in New Brunswick as I watched them print things on a MakerBot that they had built.  Ever since I had wanted to build my own 3d-printer, but have not had the know-how or money to do so.  Sadly, 4 years later, I still don't **fully** understand how to build one, I mean the concept seems ""simple enough"", and now that they can be driven from Arduino MEGA boards + RAMPS, it makes it much more affordable.  the problem is, I don't even know how to get started... i'm on a VERY tight budget, I know alot of a reprap can be printed using a reprap thereby lowering the cost quite substantially, but even then, I can't find good instructions on where to get the files to print those parts.  I have a friend who has a commercial 3D-Printer at his job, and he mentioned he might be able to print me some parts if I could get him Solidworks files, but even then i'm not sure if he'll be able to, even if I *CAN* find those files.

Before I start spending money (that I don't have) I want to make sure everything I buy is correct, can be used, and I don't end up with extra stuff that I can't use (waste of money)

My question is...  To someone who is new to building a reprap, where do I begin?  How much can I expect to spend?  Is it possible to build one ""on the cheap"" with whatever parts I can find?

You're mainly looking at the bottom of the print (you can see some blue marks from the painters tape). 

The software is the latest repatier-host, using its inbuilt sli3er engine. 

As you can see, the bottom 10ish layers were OK, then it seemed to shift an equal amount in both x and why, where it was OK for the rest of the print. 

I wondered if anyone had any ideas what caused it? I didn't notice anything odd happening to the printer, or in software, but clearly the model is off. 

Is it more likely to H/W or S/W? what can I do to try an pin down the cause? 

My printer is out for a couple more weeks anyway while I wait for a new hotend and install a new extruder, given that I know I need to pull it apart some, I'm not sure I want to try and dial in the error if its going to re-manifest its self when I replace some of the parts.

My setup:

1) RepRap Prusa Mendal from makerfarm
2) Printrboard revD
3) PronterFace
4) Slic3r 0.9.9

The problem seems to have started happening when I switched to another PLA filament because I ran out of my first roll of PLA. They were both bought from http://www.onlinefilament.com/, however, the spools were changed. This might mean that the filament has also changed. 

I noticed one thing, the filament tends to stick better on glass now, while the previous one didn't stick as well. 

So the issue here is that, frequently, my reprap would jam with the new filament. In what I can observe, the heat seems to be travelling too fast up the filament and causing the rigidity of the filament to fall, therefore when it gets pushed, the filament just bends and jams. 

So I set my solid infill speeds higher, and checked it feeding the filament faster would make the problem go away, but instead of jamming now, my stream of filament turns into dribbles intermittently after a couple layers, or after a couple dozen layers. So here are the things I've tried:

1) I thought maybe the retraction was too fast therefore causing the extruder to lose grip of the filament, but I turned it off completely, and the problem was still there. 
2) Change the layer heights from 0.15 to 0.2, but that didn't change anything.
3) I thought maybe the tightness of the screws that push the filament on the hobbed bolt was the issue, so I tried loosening it a little and then tried to tighten it further, but it seems like the problem is still there. Will have to investigate further though... 

I've used quite a bit of the filament trying to print out one part, but instead of brute forcing this myself, I'm wondering if anybody else experienced this problem.

One of the reasons I backed the project was because it was based on the RepRap and designed to be easily extensible. I fear the ACME rod/setup will make that less easily accomplished, but I'm not sure. I'm also not sure the difference is that major to warrant the extra money up front.

    cd ~/.local/share
    wget https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/downloads/pypy-2.0-beta1-linux64-libc2.15.tar.bz2
    tar xvf pypy-2.0-beta1-linux64-libc2.15.tar.bz2

Walk me through it?,alanpost,2,0,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Reprap/comments/xxwqj/i_need_to_print_botanical_id_signs_for_my_garden/,"I've been watching the 3d printing space with interest, but haven't really run into my 'killer app.'  So I haven't involved myself over much.

I think I've figured out exactly which of my problems could best be solved by 3d printing, and I'd like a temperature check to see if I'm thinking clearly.

I have a 4 acre farm that has a) a lot of different species of plants b) a lot of different kinds of people coming through it.  The inside of my house is covered top-to-bottom with labels, talking about where stuff goes in the kitchen, what category you're looking at on the bookshelf, how to operate the shower, &amp;c.

I have the same problem outside, but that environment is more demanding.  I print signs, laminate them, and tape/wire them to whatever object is their topic.  This is working all right, but I have places with no convenient mount and these signs wear out fast.

I would love to completely cover my property in labels, which is a problem of a scale I haven't managed to succeed at yet.  Can I print readable, durable signs using a 3d printer?

To the best I can understand, here are my constraints:

* I'm not in love with this technology for it's own sake.  I love it for it's ability to solve my problems.  I have neither the time nor inclination to fiddle.  I do have the time and inclination to learn my material and have a relationship with my machine, but I need to be seriously eased into it.
* Almost all of my printing needs are one-off jobs, but using one of a set of common templates.  The faster I can go from inspiration to finished product, the better.  See above about fiddling.  How are we doing with the time it takes to go from idea to product?  What about ""mass producing"" 100+ one-off products?  How much do I have to interact with the for each print job?
* Can I print text that can be read?  Do I have different ink choices?  Bonus: can I print a QR code that can be read by an iPhone?  What is the prior art here?  I am not the only person in the world that needs 1000+ outdoor signs.
* I work nearly 100% on the command-line, and honestly don't handle GUI programs really well.  I realize that CAD-ish stuff will require my getting over myself, but I am much more comfortable with programming languages than I am with... whatever it is that people do to get 3d objects represented on their computer.

Can you help?  What route will likely be most successful for me and why?  What parts of my self-imposed problem space will cause me the most problem and how should I think myself out of it?  I've barely seen 3d printers working, and would love a navigator from my problem to a solution.

I've been designing a new robot for a bit.  I have it printing at this point reasonably well, but have a few issues left to figure out.

1. Using ethernet cables to drive the stepper motors.
2. Underestanding print quality variances.

For 1:
I used these these ethernet breakout boards from simplehomenet.com and wired up some connectors for RAMPS to these breakout boards.  I'm testing a hypothesis that Ethernet will work just fine for motors.
It worked!  But after 2 minutes, the arduino crashed.  Consistently.  I would work for a few minutes, then crash.  If I removed the Ethernet cable, everything just worked -- no crashes.  What could be causing this?  I did this only on the Extruder, not the other motors.  So, I left the Hot end wired into the ethernet cable, and wired the stepper motor separately.  This worked fine.  How can I fix this -- and why does the stepper motor cause a failure after running a few minutes?

For 2:
I print using a J-Head hot end, Wade's extruder, and 3mm Ultimachine  PLA filament -- whatever the cheapest spool is.  I get great results for a while.  But over time, the results change.  I think my filament is absorbing water.  The prints become cloudy, and these strange, ""hard peaks"" appear on the surface of whatever I've printed.  I Live in Seattle, and our humidity is 100% every day, pretty much.  It really does rain every day here.  But I don't expect this much change in print quality from water.  Is this really just water, or is there something else that can cause this?  Also -- How does ABS print quality hold up over time vs PLA?  I use PLA only right now, and am thinking of switching to ABS.

The region was built on manufacturing and mining, but the industry is very clearly dying with many job losses at the local steelworks and flow-on sectors in the past decade.

The local university is conducting a lot of research into 3D printing, from intelligent materials to medical applications. But typical of most universities, they're centralizing all of this research. So rather than encouraging local manufacturing companies and the public to buy and tinker on their own 3D printers, they want everyone to come to them.

Hardcore scientific research into 3D printing is very important, but I want to bring about the emergent innovation from having a 3D printer in every home in the area.

I was thinking an ideal initiative would be something along the structure of a viral or pyramid scheme (without the scam or money exchange).

Anyone could signup to be in the queue/tree/pyramid to receive a ""free"" 3D printer. But in return, they have to print at least another printer to pass on to the next person.

I thought the concept of the RepRap being able to print a copy of itself could be harnessed, but even then it's still pretty expensive to buy parts.

~~Let me know what you guys think!~~
The purpose for me doing this initially was to create a place where I could go in depth into what exactly is required to build your own printer. I've found the RepRap wiki difficult to navigate and hard get a basic understanding of what is going on. Since I was going to building a machine myself, I figured I might as well add the build blog.

My plan is to have an ABCs of 3d printer building if you will. I feel as though that a lot of people could benefit from this. I'd also like to start maintaining a comparability list of sorts. (Firmwares for chipset boards, Slicer/firmware combos, etc.) Thoughts on this?

Also, once I have the machine built and running off of currently available firmware/software I plan to start writing my own. once I start this process I'll get into the actual engineering of a custom machine build (calculating moments, accelerating forces, motor forces, jerk, etc.) Does the RepRap community think that there would be many people out there that would truly like to design/build their own machine as I am doing?

I know I read somewhere not to post personal blogs, but I can't find that in this sub-reddit anymore. So I'm posting this, If I'm wrong about this mods, just let me know.

So, r/reprap, I would like to know what you think. I'm not the *most* technical person, but I have experience with woodwork and such, so I am fairly handy. From what I've seen, the board assembly is just a few snaps and pushes. Also, keep in mind that the extruder comes fully assembled in the kit (not sure if that's standard or not).

I'm getting OK prints now, so am planinng on heating my build platform.

I have a 'custom' machine, and the build area is 200 x 300 mm.

I have a 4mm ali plate and I plan to use toughend glass as the build platform. I have 16 of the wirewound resistors, 25W 330 hms.

Did I buy the right thing? I'm concerned about the dissipation of heat on the build bed, my power supply is 30amps and 270Watts or around that! I've been forewarned that my sanguinilolu wont be up to scratch, and also that I may require an additional power supply.

I did buy some PCB how easy is it to make a custom engraved heated bed? Where would I look ro research this further?

Thanks for your time! :)

Any thoughts on this Reprap derived printer? I'm considering getting a 3D printer for a hobby/toy. Main uses would be the ""obvious"" little replacement parts (first project: volume knob on my car stereo!), knickknack gifts, etc. I also have 2 and 4.5 year old kids who I would like to both make games/toys for but more importantly (for the 4.5 year old) get excited about technology and inventing things. 

So, all that in mind, I'm looking for something in the $400-600 range. Currently, my main focus had been on the Printrbot (Jr. and LC), Solidoodle 2, and the Eventorbot has caught my eye. 

They're all in my budget but the Eventorbot has some things going for it: huge (relatively) print area, very solid/simple design, claimed delivery time, it's a complete kit, looks upgradable. Cons I can see: untested product, heated print bed is extra (same for all of them though)... Anything else?

I'd prefer a kit so I can really understand how it works, so I can upgrade and repair easily. 

So, any thoughts on this particular unit? There's two weeks left on the kickstarter so I have to act kinda quickly if I want in...",,False,self,t5_2qq91,False,,,True,t3_11bxb1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Reprap/comments/11bxb1/thoughts_on_eventorbot_xpost_from_r3dprinting/,

So far I have looked at Ultimaker, Printrbot+, Up!, Tangibot, Replicator, and various other reprap iterations and closed-source printers. 

Please keep in mind, all my knowledge comes from reading things on the net, and have no practical knowledge to base my decisions on. After much reading, Mendel seems to win the People's Choice Award. It also fits my budget. Being a student, I have a very low budget. I've worked all summer and willing to spend some of the money to fund this project.

MendelMax: A very rigid mendel, and mendel seems to be the favorite kid of the block. Based on the pictures, it looks like a mendel that is (or can be) built to last.

Mendel i3: The new kid of the block that will revolutionize mendel. Less parts count means easier building and less maintenance. Probably cheaper too.

Any advice/help would be much appreciated. Thanks.",,False,self,t5_2qq91,False,,,True,t3_1dnj6z,http://www.reddit.com/r/Reprap/comments/1dnj6z/electronicssoftware_help/,
