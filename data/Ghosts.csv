He was wheelchair bound for the majority of his life and had numerous health problems. But he was my best friend. 

Fast forward to 5 years past his death. I happen to move into his home. I'm ecstatic yet sad. Good memories clouded by the sadness of missing my uncle. Everything seemed normal. I wasnt a believer of ghosts or spirits so I never expected anything to happen. Second night after I moved in his bedroom door opened. I immediately thought it wasn't latched properly. Next day the tv swiveled on its own. I thought that was a bit weird. 

My uncle was always a jokester. Loved bugging people. I noticed that items would be out of place a lot. Or I'd lose something then after frantically looking it would be in its original spot after some time had passed. 

My daughter will often stare into a random area and start to smile and babble happily (she's 10 months). When she was a new born I could SWEAR I heard a male voice coming from her room as she would suddenly stop crying but, of course no one was ever in there. 

What has inspired me to share my experiences tonight is that I now know for sure it is my uncle haunting my house.

One day, I was about to walk across a street and a friend pulled me back, saying 'she told me to pull your backpack'. I would have died.

I honestly didn't think much of it until I got married. I got home this one day and my husband said 'did you see her?'. I had no idea what he was talking about, but he explained that after I went to work he had seen a long haired woman standing in the mirror looking at him with an accepting look.

I had just finished up MOS school (training for your military job I was an Electrical Equipment Repair Specialist.) I was placed into a room with 2 guys from my MOS school, one of which was in boot camp with me his name is Tucker, the other guys name is Millburn . 

Allow me to layout the room for you with this crude drawing.
http://imgur.com/n38B7 
red = beds

We moved into the room, and a few nights later I woke up in the middle of the night roughly 2:00am (which is unusual for me in the first place.) My eyes adjusted to the dark quickly and I saw a shadow in the middle of the room standing @ Millburns ""secretary"" (the three boxes in between me and Tuckers bed his footlocker was facing his bed.) I could see Millburn asleep in his bed and thought it odd that Tucker was going through his stuff. Being as Tucker is my friend I rolled over and decided to ask him about it in the morning. 

Our alarms went off and we all got up got dressed and went to work. Me and Tucker went to the chow hall that afternoon and while sitting there talking he looked at me and asked why I was going through Millburns ""secretary"" last night. I laughed and told him it wasn't me ... then reality set in, we could both see Millburn, the door was deadbolted and the only window was above Tuckers bed, if someone else got in that room they would have to crawl across Tucker or unlock the heavy metal door without us noticing. We both shrugged it off as something odd and creepy... and of course that alone would be a decent story.

Over the next few weeks we had the wall lockers (3 doors) all be locked @ night and open in the morning, not just unlocked but wide open. Not to mention the strange nightmares I'd been having I thought it was super strange.

I had been having nightmares where I would wake up, look around with my eyes and the room would look normal. I would go to get up and piss, and I couldn't move, couldn't sit up, couldn't speak, nothing. Then I would close my eyes, take a deep breath like I was trying to reset my limbs (same as restarting a computer I suppose) and when I opened my eyes there would be a shadow pinning me down. I would freak out and try to struggle and eventually sit up after the shadow faded away. 

I had had this dream with increasing frequency, and was pretty disturbed by it.

1 Year later. Tucker and I were roommates again, on the second floor on the opposite half of the barracks, we had ordered pizza and were relaxing in our rooms on a Friday, neither of us were big drinkers.

Our conversation was going in the direction of who else we may get as a roommate, we joked about Millburn (he was to put it lightly a psychopath.) That was how we arrived at the meat of the topic though, the old room, I said to him ""I Used to have these freaky dreams in that room, and I haven't had a single one since."" His reply sent cold chills down my back. It was something along the lines of ""You wake up, try to get up, and can't move, that's when you notice the witch pinning you down, you struggle a few minutes and are finally free. I had the same dreams, but there was nothing we could do about them so I didn't mention them, was better to pretend they didn't exist."" A long moment of silence ensued. All I could say was ""I suppose you're right, what would we do, tell them we want to move rooms because we think there is a ghost in our room?"" 

Tucker wasn't some strange stringy kid, and neither was I. Tucker Is/was (haven't seen him in years) 5'8-10"" 240 ish lbs. of pure muscle. He is from the country in Georgia, and had a few stories from when he was a kid, things he knew about ""the paranormal,"" passed down through his family. I was 6' 190 lbs. muscle at the time, both raised in a christian household. I even then spent most of my time reading articles, on anything that would make me more knowledgeable, everything psychology, quantum physics, chemistry, computer sciences. I have found something that would explain the paralysis its apparently something males experience, but to have the same dream kind of stretches the perception, and only when sleeping in the same room....

Thanks for taking the time to read my story /r/Ghosts I hope it was good enough. I apologize for spelling mistakes and grammar mistakes in advance, English was always my weakness.

It was a nice house and had a huge attic playroom with a bedroom in it (it was huge to 4 yr old me). My uncle who was 15 at the time lived in the attic bedroom, but the area outside of his room was my sister's and my playroom.  There was a regular staircase going up to the attic with a door at the bottom.  My room was at the bottom of that staircase.

I never felt very comfortable in that house, but I was always with other people so I was okay.  I never liked to just play alone in the attic since it was a little creepy, though it had a lot of natural light going into it.  The weird thing is that I remember every moment of living in that house for the 2 yrs we lived there.  What happened one night happened after living there about a year.

I always slept with my door open at that age for some reason. I would hear all sorts of sounds in the kitchen at night, like silverware rattling, cabinets opening, etc, but I was convinced that it was someone just up getting a snack, or doing dishes and I just couldn't see the kitchen light based on the angles of the walls, or something equally stupid.  That all changed one night.

I woke up about 1AM one night to the sounds of footsteps coming down the attic stairs, which wasn't all that unusual since my uncle would have to come down the stairs to use the bathroom. I watched the door open, and there was no one.  At this revelation my heartbeat began racing. I tried as hard as I could to peer into the darkness of the hallway outside my door.  It only seemed to get darker, and then it said my name. I can still hear the gravelly whisper ""Hey robbie...we can see you.  hey, robbie, come upstairs and play...""  That was it for me.  I screamed like you see in the movies. My parents came in the room like they were on fire. I told them what happened and they just got mad at me, told me to go back to sleep and that it was just a dream.

They shut off the lights and went back to bed, but there was no way I was going to be sleeping the rest of the night. Shortly after everything settled down, I heard ""we're still here""...that was it, I was done.  I screamed as loud as I could and ended up sleeping in my parents room that night.

The next night something really weird happened.  I went to bed as normal, though terrified, but I closed my door. As I settled in and finally fell asleep I was once again woken up to the sounds of the rattling in the kitchen and movement beyond my closed door. I looked around my room and in the corner of the room there was a black, shadowy...thing.  Not a normal shadow, just really dark, darker than it should have been. It was just sitting there. It made me feel calm and safe. I would have conversations with it, though I never recall it responding.  After that night, I slowly became more confident and secure at night. Most nights the dark mass was there in the corner, I guess protecting me from whatever the hell it was that wanted ""to play with me"".  

I remember every detail so vividly...just writing this sent chills up my spine. It's for this reason that I believe in ghosts. ",,False,self,t5_2r1q4,False,,,True,t3_xlbt7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/xlbt7/i_was_4it_knew_my_name/,

(Also on r/paranormal),TheOregonian,59,14,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/17l9m3/can_ghosts_stop_time_read_my_story_and_it_just/,"The first account of my experiences happened almost 8 years ago, I was 16 at the time.

I have trouble sleeping and always have mostly due to restless legs as well as suffering from anxiety. Most nights I would get up and walk around the house, get some water, use the bathroom, do some leg exercises, and stuff like that to help me sleep better.

On one particular night I had more trouble sleeping than usual. Legs weren't much of the issue this time but my anxiety was flaring up, which was unusual only because I normally get it from stressful days, school, work, etc. As well as the anxiety, I also had this strange feeling of being alone but being watched even though my brother shared a room with me and he was fast asleep, and a little too quiet. He is always shifting or mumbling something. I shake it off to be just a weird random feeling.

I start to walk out into the hallway towards the bathroom and I notice it's very quiet. Like the ringing in your ears kind of quiet but even without the ringing. Now we lived out in the country with very thin walls, always hearing something outside, mostly wind. My dad also snores a lot. Not tonight, it was very still.

I head to the bathroom, finish my business, and walk toward the kitchen when I get that weird feeling again and so bad it's like someone is right behind me, so I turn around, no one is there. I turn back and from the corner of my eye see a small figure dash from the living room towards the kitchen. It was a full moon that night so the room was well lit. No guessing on shadows here.

Starting on my way through the living room after gathering myself from fear and rising anxiety, I hear small footsteps run through the kitchen. Toddler-like but more experienced, agile. We didn't have rats or other rodents. We did have 3 cats but they were all outside cats and not allowed indoors. None of my family has heard rats or any scratching in the walls or floors, I'm the only one to have ever heard the running. So I decided to tuck my tail and jump back into bed under the covers hoping I was dreaming or imagining things. But then I started to get really thirsty and needed that glass of water.

I head back to the kitchen and notice something unusual again, the fridge isn't running. Normally it had this small buzz to it, especially on quiet nights. The power wasn't out because the bathroom lights were working and the microwave display was on. All I could hear was the clock ticking in the front room near my parents bedroom.

I finish my glass of water and head through the dining room but before I get to the living room, the next anxiety flare happened.

I hear whispers from the laundry room then the clock stopped ticking. Dead silence. Only the sound of my breathing. I spent what felt like an hour slowly moving to the front room, almost paralyzed in fear. When I finally got there I checked the clock. No movement. Hands perfectly still. 

I spend a few moments deciding if I should wake my parents or not and decide to try, even if I do upset them by  waking them I have to try, my life may be on the line. I rush over to their door and pound on it a few times. No answer. I open it and ask my mom to wake up. My dad is also a light sleeper so something isn't right, I thought maybe it got to them before I did. I head for the front door. Step out to the porch and even outside everything is perfectly still and soundless. It was freezing and no friends lived close enough. I spent maybe ten minutes outside before the cold wasn't bearable anymore and I had to face what might be living in the house.

I freak out and remember my brothers(the youngest had his own room, lucky bastard, right across from ours with the bathroom in between). I start to head back to the bedrooms and there it is for a few seconds by the fireplace in the dining room, a small shadowed figure, but seemingly solid. It dashes around the side of the fireplace and vanishes. A short and distant sound but very close atmospheric laughter like a child's.

That's it. My body can't take anymore, I can hear the blood pumping in my skull. I try from the bedroom but stumble through the living room and that was it, darkness engulfed me as I passed out in the middle of the floor. 

I woke up about an hour or two later, very uncomfortable with a bad headache and remember what happened. Almost passed out gain but quickly collected myself. I nearly break into my youngest brothers room and turn on the light. He wakes up half asleep and yells at me to turn the lights off. This wakes my dad and he comes to check on things followed by mom. I was too afraid to sound insane to my Christian parents, so I told them I just head footsteps in the house and was checking to make sure everyone was okay and that I had been to their room first. Obviously no recollection of that ever happening to them but they put it off as me being too quiet about it. Everyone returns to sleep but me for a few hours until I was exhausted by fear and what the hell just happened.

Thoroughly the years of living there small variations of this event happened and I still put it off as ghosts. I always had such horrible anxiety living there but it has gotten much better since I moved out. But every time I step foot in that house I feel my anxiety flare up again and the weird feeling of being watched.

All I know about the house's history is that it was an old motorcycle repair shop before it became a residence. No deaths to my knowledge.

""This is cool, they have a backyard so we can get a pet!""

This room is maybe 10x10 feet, nothing in it except for every single inch of wall and CEILING was covered in satanic drawings, pictograms and depictions.  Within 15 minutes that room was painted over, the light bulb taken, the door shut and locked from the outside never to be open again.  That was the start of it.

So, now we have all the creepy things that happened.  I only know what I experenced, my mom to this day refuses to talk about anything in that house, my sister was almost too young to remember anything except one big incident and my dad is like ""FUCK THAT SHIT.""

So a little history, my dad works the I-500 Snowmachine Race in the Sault Ste. Marie MI, so during the month of January he'd be home always after 2a.m. at the earliest.  Well once in a while he would stop home after work, before prepping the I-500.  Numerous times me and my sister would be sitting watching prime time TV and we'd hear the screen outside door open and the oak door deadbolt unlock, the doors open, then both the doors slam shut.  We would both go running to the back door thinking dad was home early to get something.  We'd round the corner and there would be no one there.  Multiple times this would happen.

When we moved in and i got to throw stuff in my room I remember finding a small front-loader childs toy in my closet.  My parents and I thought this was weird since they don't remember that being there when there were shown the house (being completely empty and already moved out of) and there was also a strange symbol drawn on the wall of my closet.  Needless to say I NEVER slept with that closet door open.

Often i would be playing with legos or video game in my room and if you've ever grown up with legos you get to know and recognize the sound they make when you throw a single lego on to a pile of others.  It makes a very distinctive platic hollow 'plink', and would hear random lego sounds from behind me, to the side, always just out of site.  Eventually I just ignored the sounds.

It was my sister's 6th or 7th b-day (sorry no cake day picks to submit for karma) and i had helped her clean her room earlier that day since i'm a awesome older bro (and my mom told me to :P).  So most of the way through her party my mom yells for her and me upstairs, so we go quick thinking maybe it's some big b-day present.  NOPE!  my sisters room was TRASHED.  all her toys out of her boxes, closet, clothes out of draws.  My mom thought she had done this and we both told her no we had cleaned the room and been downstairs the whole time for her party.  We still had to clean it all up.

More stories later as i have to go to work...


EDIT:

Lets see, so far we have multiple backdoor unbolting, opening, closings, sisters room gettin thrashed after we cleaned it up, legos getting thrown in my room and a room of Satanic Evil in the basement.
So upon asking my dad, the only thing he would recount was that often when he was alone he would hear and see the door to my room open and close. Yeah, he didn't mention this at all until i asked him years later.

OK, here's the biggest event to happen to me, and it'll take a little setup to get it all in perspective. On the second floor was 3 rooms and bathroom all connected to the same small landing. My sister's room had another door in it that lead to an attic type room. My mom used this as her closet, there was a pipe that ran the entire length of the room so she hung her clothes on it as well we some cabinets and drawers built into one side it. There was also a door that led to the outside to a tiny ass balcony, like big enough for the door top open on to and that's it. I HATED this room and I didn't know why. As soon as we moved in this room just gave me the creeps. So, if you were standing in this room and looking out into my sisters room you can see the door that leads to the hallway fully. One day, i'm the only one home during the summer and i'm finishing my chores. Laundry is last and I always put my moms stuff away last since i hated being in the room. So I walk in, put clothes in the drawers, hang up her couple blouses and turn to leave and BAM I freeze.

Sitting on the other side of the door frame(leading into the attic room) is this basketball sized, blacker than black, matty haired THING. just sitting...waiting. At this point in my life i've never smoked a cig, drank a beer, done ANYTHING that could possibly change my body chemistry. This was real, it was staring me in the face, and I could feel the fear in the air. Being 13 years old though all I could do was stand there utterly frozen.

Then it moved.

It shot across the door frame(from right to left) and dissapeared on the other side. As soon as it was out of site my brain turned back on and had one thought going through it. RUN...run now...run now fast...fast fast fast. My body soon listened. All this time i kept my eyes glued open on both the doors and I didn't want this thing to be running out in the hall and then me lose where it went. As far as i could tell it was waiting just on the left side of the door outta site. I lept over the door's threshold both hands in the tightest little fists i could make ready to fight for my life. As I scanned the length of the wall between the two doors there was nothing...just nothing. I spent the rest of the day over at my friends.

It was with that incident that it clicked. Why the previous owners had 2 small dogs(found this out after we moved) but we couldn't have any. The room down in the basement, the what seemed like rust color on the cement floor of the room. Yeah, something bad happened in that house to get the previous tennents evicted. And i'd bet my last nickel something bad happened to one of those dogs and that's what i saw that day.
I may not be religious, but that day I learned there are other planes of existance besides this one, and at certain leylines on this globe those energies can pierce through. For I stared down this blacker than black entity for a good 15 seconds and it is now forever burned into my memory.

EDIT2:  here's google's street view.  It's a house that's red on the top half, white on the bottom half.  http://g.co/maps/ggffg

Any other questions i'd be glad to answer!

The kind that would make your skin crawl, maybe even induce a dark anger. But this isn't about them, this is about the only family member that treated me like he actually loved me, that he was glad I existed. My grandfather.

He served in the war, and came back less a leg due to a bomb, with many a war wound and story. He retired in some shithole little town and stayed there for the rest of his life. It was an old mining town and eventually he was literally the last living soul in that town.

When I was turning 5 years old, he came down to the city to see me. His nurses wheeled him in in his wheelchair with a couple machines that were hooked up to him. I remember asking him if he was half robot. Anyways, he stayed the entire day, gave me a helium filled balloon and a teddy bear, both of which I still have 20 years later. Around 5 his nurses said that they needed to bring him back to the hospital and to say our goodbyes. Me and him didn't believe in goodbye, we believed in ""See ya later!"" I gave him a hug and told him I loved him. He held onto me extra long and said he'd see me in a bit.

I watched as he left in the ambulance back to the hospital 4 hours away. I was sad but had a great day. My dad had told me to get ready for bed around 9 and I hopped right into bed exhausted. I fell asleep almost immediately.

I woke up several hours later , about 3 in the morning to someone sitting on my bed. I rubbed the sleep from my eyes and seen my grandad sitting there. He had no doctors or nurses with him, and I remember he looked healthy and happy. He had both his legs and I remember he was smiling just as peaceful as could be. He put his hand on my leg, and spoke.

""Hey kiddo, sorry I woke ya""

""I miss you already grandpa""

""I miss you too Hun. But I have to be quick. Know that No matter what happens in your life you'll be okay. Even when it looks like nothing good will ever happen, you're strong. You'll make it happen. Life is going to deal you some blows but I will always be there, watching over you. I love you. Remember that when it feels like no one else in the world does. I love you. I have to be going now, I have a lot to do this evening.""

I asked ""When will I see you again grampie? Can we play again soon?""

He smiled and told me to go to sleep. Told me he loved me again and I fell asleep almost immediately. I woke up the next morning and ran to my dad, both him and my step mother looked like they had been crying. I told him what happened and that made him openly cry. I asked what was wrong and he told me that there was no way it could have been my grampie or I was dreaming. I asked why. He said,

""Grandad passed away last night around 3 in the morning. He was in the hospital and he just went to sleep and didn't wake up.""

This is a true story, and I still feel him to this day. When I'm down or feel hopeless, I always feel that nudge of positivity. So a little positive for you guys.",,False,self,t5_2r1q4,True,,,True,t3_quj99,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/quj99/a_positive_ghost_story/,

My roommate and I live in a one bedroom dorm at the end of a hall, so we've never had to worry about sounds coming in through the vents and yesterday was our last day of school, all of our neighbors have moved out. Last night my roommate, one of my closest friends, and I were crying, because unfortunately she won't be able to afford to go to my college anymore, so this is our last year together. We were sitting on her bed sobbing our eyes out, (yeah yeah, like sophomores in college do) but eventually I climbed in my own bed, our beds are parallel to each other, and we each fell asleep. At about 4 in the morning I hear her sobbing and I wake up and feel terrible for her. I roll over and she's facing me in her bed, fast asleep. Her face completely relaxed. And I can hear CLEAR AS DAY her crying. Well, somebody crying. Hard. And it is in my room. So I listen for another 30 seconds in a cold sweat and then completely freak out and start to scream and she wakes up and the crying stops completely. Like instantly. We checked the room top to bottom for an explanation and just can't find one. I have NO IDEA how this happened and there's no way I'll be able to sleep in here again.

As I said in the tittle I live in a 120 year old house since I was born. Like every other old house, this one has it weird noises, but something started to happen a few years ago.

My first ""paranormal experience"" happened when i was laying on my dad's bed, with my head where you put your feet. I had a perfect view of the distribution hall of the bedrooms. Suddenly while i was watching TV I SEE a man walking from my sister's bedrom to mine. IT WAS A MAN, not a shade or anything. I was so convinced it was a real person that I stood up and went to his encounter. I walked into in my bedroom and nobody was there. That was the moment that i really got scared. I still dont know what was that but every time i think of that i, get goosebumps.

Fast foward to a few weeks ago, i was cooking, the kitchen has a door connecting to the dinning room. This door was closed all the time i was cooking. One moment, i went to the fridge (you cant see the door from the fridge), and when i come back, the door was slightly open (i was alone in the house), i closed it, no biggie. I kept cooking until i need to go back to the fridge. I come back, and again the door open, but this time...completly open. I reach the door knob to close it, but before i do, it fucking closes! scaring the shit out of me. No wind, no windows open, no other doors open, nobody in the house. Nothing. 

Other things keep happening, like the tv turning on by itself, or footsteps...but nothing out of the normal things that you can hear in an old house made of wood.

Well, those are 2 of my most real experiencies.

It all started when I moved our of the dorms 3 weeks ago... I moved in at an apartment near my college where I live alone... its creepy, old and small... but that's all I can afford. Anyways couple of days after I moved in I started hearing annoying noises... the kind that comes from a washer...  this kept on going through the whole first week, but only at night...I just persumed it was my neighbors staying up late or w/e so I ignored it...as it kept going on I kept getting annoyed, so I went to them to complain but they just said that it wasn't them and shut the door in my face... I complained many times but they just kept telling me to stop annoying them... I couldn't do much more since i was alone and they were a bunch of guys... The tenant would just ask them to stay quite and forget about it later. I tried my best ignoring all these sounds, and eventually I got used to them... however what really was the ""deal breaker"" (I don't know the term sorry english is my 2nd language) was 2 days ago, when while I was lying in my bed browsing youtube i felt a very hot and humid(wet) feeling on my face, I checked the AC and it was off... It kept coming and going and it really bothered me but I didn't think much of it... what really got me was when browsing the laptop I felt this humid air but with it was also some kind of fog which was very visible from the light of the laptop screen... I got freaked out and just tried to blow it out with my hand... it wouldn't go away... I jumped out of bed and tried to take a couple of pictures with my phone since this was really weird/interesting and kind off creepy... I took 6 pictures but only have 2.. the other 4 are very white and only the corners are showing I have no idea why but i just presumed it was the lens or w/e so i deleted them....

I used to live in very rural West Virginia. I mean very, very rural. Two traffic lights in the entire county, 2 hours from the closest Walmart, you get the picture. Anyway, my family and I decide we wanted to take a camping trip up in this hollow (""holler"" as we call it) we took our 4wheelers (see: ATV) to often. We end up rounding up 8-9 family members and 10-11 friends, so around 20 people in all. 

On the evening of our camping trip, we get everything loaded up onto our 4wheelers and head out. The place where we're going is basically one giant valley. I end up riding with my uncle. He's the uncle that likes aggravating, picking on, scaring, etc. his nieces and nephews. On the ride over there, he tells me this story about where we're going. He says that there's a field about 6 miles from our camping spot that had an elementary school on it in the 1800's, and that one day it burned completely to the ground (I actually did know that part was true). He goes on to say that while everyone knows about that, not everyone knows that none of the kids in the school made it out of the fire alive. Then he says ""on full moon nights, at 3am, you can still hear the screams of the little girls and boys as they're dying."" As with every other time he has tried to scare me, I tell him he's stupid and I never give it a second thought. 

We get to our camping spot, set up, and make a trip out to that field (it's referred to by everyone back home as School-House Bottom). I've been there hundreds of times, just because it's a nice ride out there, and it's by a river; very peaceful. We spend some time there and then head back to camp. At this point it's probably 10pm. We get back, roast and eat some hot dogs and marshmallows, talk, laugh, etc. I end up telling everyone else there what my uncle had said and they all laughed it off too. Then, around 1am, my uncle suggests us going on another ride. Half of our party went, half stayed. I went, again with my uncle. As we're riding along, he asks if I want to see where those kids' bodies/ashes were buried. I told him ""sure,"" figuring I was calling his bluff. But no. He goes off the trail, up in the woods, somewhere I had never seen before. At this point I get a little spooked, but not bad. Then we come upon a dozen or more tiny, unmarked headstones. I'm kind of at a loss for words, because I didn't know about them my entire life I had been riding up through there. Still, I didn't believe they were from the school house as he said. 

We head back to camp. Once we were back and settled in, we all sat around looking up at Mars, because this was at a time when Mars was visible from Earth, and we had a good view because the sky was crystal clear and there was that full moon. After fifteen minutes or so of sitting there, I ask my uncle what time it was. He lights up his backlit watch to show me 2:59am. I sit there for another 30 seconds and think ""see, 3am and nothing."" Then, I hear faint screams coming from down the valley, where the school house field and headstones were. They get louder and louder as the screams get closer and closer. I say ""screams"" because they sounded JUST like a group of little girls and boys screams. When the full force of the screams get to us, I swear it seemed like they just stayed there, like the source of the screams wasn't 10 feet from us, for at least 10-15 seconds. During this time I am completely frozen, and no one else is moving either. The screams eventually go on down the valley until we can't hear them any more. No one moves a muscle or says a word for what feels like forever. Then, in a crying-voice, one of the girls say ""what....was....that?"" And at that moment, every single one of us got up, hopped on our 4wheelers, and booked it home. We didn't grab anything, not tents, food, nothing but our keys. 

It was a good 30 minute ride from home, in which we made it in 15 minutes at the most. I got home, went to bed, and had nightmares all night.

It was located in an over 100 year old building with quite a colorful history.


During the third night in the hotel I suddenly woke up. Don't know exactly why, but when I opened my eyes, there was a young, beautiful, blond lady sitting in a chair next to the bed. I immediately got up to a sitting position, rubbed my eyes and looked again. She wore black, lace nightgown or negligee. She had long hair cut in a fringe - almost exactly like [this](http://cdn.blogs.sheknows.com/celebsalon.sheknows.com/2008/08/anna-faris-the-house-bunny-new-york-premiere.jpg).


I was able to observe her for about twenty seconds. Unlike when awoken from a sleep and seeing night terrors, the image wasn't blurry at all nor did it vanish. It was the exact opposite. The more awoke I became the clearer I could see her. She didn't move at all, just staying calmly in the same position, head tilted slightly upwards, like she was looking in the eternity. But her eyes were closed, and she has a gentle smile.


After some moments, I suddenly remembered my wife sleeping next to me and checked on her. When I turned my head back, the lady was gone. At that point my wife woke also up and asked why was I sitting. Still being a bit shocked of the experience, I just said I had to go the the toilet. In the morning I asked about the night to make sure I wasn't sleeping and my wife confirmed that I had sat on the bed and then went to the toilet.

One Saturday, I was in the supply closet when I felt someone/thing grab and squeeze my shoulder.  I walked out of the closet and asked my coworkers if anyone had been in there with me.  They all said no, and when I thought about it, there is no way any of them could have gotten back to their seats in time.

One of my coworkers had been working there for over 20 years.  When I told her what happened, she told me that it reminded her of an old boss she had when she first started working there.  She said he would grab people by the shoulder, and tell them they were doing a good job.

A couple of years later we were moving to a new office.  Before we moved, our station decided to conduct a special about paranormal events that had occurred in the building.  I decided to be there while they were recording.  They brought in some paranormal hunters and a few clairvoyants.  

While investigating one of the most 'active' rooms, one of the clairvoyants was staring at me.  I went over to her and introduced myself.  She proceeded to tell me, that he only wanted to tell me that I was doing a good job.  When I asked her who, she said ""the man that grabbed your shoulder.""

Everyone there promised me that the clairvoyants and paranormal hunters knew nothing about any of the stories.  I didn't know what do think, still don't.

Ok...as promised, here is our ghostly tale...

 

A couple little things happened at first. Objects would be out of place. The TV controller was moved from it’s usual spot. We’d hear what sounds like someone walking around the house at night or coughing coming from downstairs. The TV turned itself on a couple time. Then other things started happening….

Luke and I both left for work at the exact same time on this particular morning. The only one left in the house was our Loki. Luke had to come back to the house a couple hours later to grab something. Upon entering the house, he was shocked to see all the cupboard doors in the kitchen were wide open! We phoned Luke’s Mom to ask if she had gone over to the house at all that morning (she is the only other person with a key to our house). She said neither she nor Luke’s Dad had been there that day.

A few days later, Luke was in the basement working on some music. He heard a loud crash in the hallway outside of the recording studio room. Startled, he went to see what had made all the racket. Looking into the hallway he saw the jug of laundry detergent lying on the hallway floor. Now, the laundry detergent is always sitting on top of the washing machine in the laundry room. This is about 10 feet from where the detergent was in the hallway. The washing machine was not on and even if it had been, the vibration would not be enough to send the detergent flying that far! About a month later we had gone out for the night. When we came home I noticed the laundry detergent was beside the kitchen sink. I asked Luke why he brought it upstairs and he said he hadn’t touched it.

On another night, Luke and I were in bed. I was already asleep, but Luke was just dozing off. He heard a noise that jolted him awake. He didn’t believe what he heard at first because he was so close to being asleep so he just lay in bed for a few minutes waiting to hear it again. And so he did. 2 more times. The noise sounded as though someone was trying to open our bedroom door. Jiggling the doorknob. As soon as he heard it the next 2 times, he shook me awake, jumped out of bed and opened the door to see what was making the noise. No one was there. Our dog was beside our bed sleeping so he didn’t bump into the door to make the noise. We checked the entire house thinking maybe someone broke in. But there was no one.

Luke was in the shower the other day. He heard a noise while he was in the shower, but thought Loki was scratching at the door or something, but when he got out, he saw that the bathroom window had been opened. He was alone in the house.

 Another day, Luke's Mom had come over to help us clean up the house. She was helping with the laundry so she was in and out of the laundry room. She came upstairs for a few minutes and we started talking about the ghost. Again I decided it would be funny if I yelled out 'ghoooooost! We miss you!!'. Afterwards, Luke's Mom went back down to the laundry room and discovered that the lightbulb had shattered. It didn't just burn out, it EXPLODED!

I had gone out with some friends to do some last minute Halloween shopping. Luke called me in a panic… he said he was sitting outside our house because the door to the spare room just slammed shut on it’s own. Now, this door gets stuck on the carpet when you close it so there’s no way a breeze or something could have caused it.

We recently got a new roommate... VICKERS! He was hanging out in the lower level of the house and got up to do something. He walked by his bedroom door and it slammed shut! I was upstairs and I thought he had tripped and fallen because it was such a loud bang.

This next ghostly tale was most likely a dream, but terrifying none the less...

Luke didn't tell me any of this until the next day.

Luke and I were sleeping... I had my arm under his pillow. Luke went to grab my hand and started rubbing it. Then he went to follow my arm back up under the pillow, but as he did, the arm came from the opposite direction... it was coming from under the bed. All I remember is Luke jumping out of bed and saying he was having terrible nightmares and he needed to go watch tv and sleep on the couch.

So Luke went to sleep on the couch... just as he was drifting off, he heard a noise that sounded like something hitting metal. It woke him up and when he opened his eyes he saw one of the stools in our living room had moved closer to him and was turned as if someone was watching him sleep. Creeeeeeeeeepy!

A couple weeks have gone by with no strange happenings...

And that leads us to yesterday's interesting occurence. I was the last to leave, first to come home. When I came home I noticed most of the pillows from our living room couch were removed and placed beside the stool in our living room. There was a bedroom pillow at one end of the couch and the blanket was on the couch (see photo). Confused, I called Luke and asked if he had slept on the couch (even though I know he hadn't that night). Luke said he hadn't slept on the couch and the pillows were on it when he left for work that morning. So I texted Vickers and asked if he slept on the couch... no dice. The pillows were too far from the couch to think that Loki had knocked them off by accident... and why would Loki put a bedroom pillow on the couch? Soooo... either someone put a lot of effort into breaking into our house just to take a nap... or we have a lazy ghost.

We'll keep everyone updated with more ghost stories as they happen! Feel free to comment with a ghost story of your own :)

Jan 10, 2012 update:

So we have a couple ghost updates. 

Back when Vickers was still our room mate, I got a text in the morning from him asking if I had left some stuff in front of his door.  I was still up in my room so I went downstairs to see what he was talking about.  In front of his door there was a key, a lighter and a pair of sunglasses (see pic below).  We'd never seen any of these objects before so we were confused at where they came from, but even more confused about how they got there.  We had all gone to bed at the same time that night so unless one of us sleep walks it's a mystery!

October 2011 - My friend Ryan Collinson came down from Alberta to stay with us for our wedding.  Luke and I were busy running around one day doing wedding stuff so Ryan was at the house alone.  He decided to have a shower and while he was in the washroom he heard whistling coming from downstairs.  He thought maybe Luke had come home, but when he went to check, no one was there.  He thought maybe it was the tv, but when the tv went from the show to a commercial the whistling still continued.  Weird...or what?

November 2011 - Luke an I were watching tv in the living room one night and we were talking about toy pianos and how they sound really cool and creepy.  Then the topic changed to a show I was watching about the real exorcism the movie 'the exorcist' was based on.  While we were talking about it we both heard a really weird creepy tune that seemingly came from nowhere.  It was only a few notes and it sounded like it was being played on a toy piano.  No joke!!  We both looked at each other like wtf...did you just hear that?

March 2012 - Luke was cleaning the house one day...I was at work, dogs were outside.  We have a few stools in our kitchen.  Luke left the room for a minute and when he came back one of the stools was moved over to the kitchen counter and one of the cupboard doors was wide open.  It looked like a little kid pushed the stool over there to try to get something out of the cupboard.  Weird? ...or what!

April 2012 - We now have a new roommate (Mat) and we didn't have a key made for him yet.  He was going to be at work until 130am the one night so he asked us to leave the door open for him since we'd already be in bed.  When Luke and I went up to bed I made sure to check the door.  It was unlocked.  About half an hour later I went down to grab a glass of water and again I made sure the door was unlocked.  At 130am I was woken up to a call from Mat who was locked out of our house!  Luke had to go down and unlock the door to let him in.

April 9, 2012 - Just got a text from Mat.  He woke up from a nap to Loki up in our bedroom, barking his head off.  Somehow our front door opened itself and was wide open when Mat went to check it out.  So...either someone's been breaking in...or the ghost is trying to get out? haha

May 2013 - Shane was sleeping in our basement.  He woke up at 330am and had a weird feeling that he should look over at the lower level door.  As soon as he did it creaked all the way open.  Another night he felt like something jumped over him and landed on the couch behind him.",,False,self,t5_2r1q4,False,,,True,t3_1jlh0l,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/1jlh0l/our_haunted_house_in_kitchener_on/,

First of all, let me tell you I am not a believer or a religious person, but my workers are, which I respect, but they are freaked out. Anyways, among the things that happened just yesterday are: the bathroom ""available/occupied"" lock turned itself to ""occupied"" (please note this can only be done from the inside of the bathroom) locking the bathroom. Nobody was inside, this happened when we were closing the store. When we tried to slide a plastified paper through the side of the door to get the lock to slide back, ""something"" pulled the paper out of my hands, thinking I had just simply put the paper too long inside, I tried with a second piece of plastified paper, and the same thing happened, this occurred when one of my staff was standing by me and the other staff was a few feet away at plain sight. Then we stepped back to think of a better idea to open the bathroom, when one of the other staff said ""the door just unlocked itself"" (there were three of us, all together at all times, no way one of us was messing around) when we all looked, sure enough the door read ""available"". We naturally went inside, nothing was in there, but the two pieces of plastified paper were by the window sill, an approximate distance from the door of 2 1/2 meters, too far to just have accidentally dropped them, I think. At this point we all were kinda anxious to get outta the store, so we were packing our things, again, the three of us together, when the store TV comes on with full volume (we never turn the volume up on the TV since we play music on the stereo) As we were leaving, I was trying to calm the other two staff down, since they both were to the point of tears, but no explanation of my part helped at all, and now none of them two want to close the store ever again. What kind of reasonable explanation can I offer them, so they don't think that they are going to die from an ""invisible"" attacker? If you ask me, I have no idea what happened, the TV might just be static, but the door lock turning and the papers being pulled out of my hands, I fail to explain that to myself.

1369085297.0,27,self.Ghosts,1epxu4,An [OC] Hooded Spector personal experience in my apartment that used to be a hospital...,MissIreneAdler,30,3,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/1epxu4/an_oc_hooded_spector_personal_experience_in_my/,"There was a hooded spectre in my apartment...

When I first moved to New York City my then-boyfriend and I both moved into a very small ground floor studio apartment in a building that had been converted into living quarters from an old hospital.
One night, while he was away, my best friend ""Julie"" had come to visit. She was sleeping on the ground next to my bed on an air mattress. I was having trouble sleeping and was facing the wall, but after a little while I rolled over facing the rest of the room. Julie had gotten up, put on her coat and pulled up the hood. She was standing in the middle of the room, not moving. I thought this was odd since there was really no reason to get up, let alone put on her coat with the hood up.
""Julie, where are you going? Why do you have your coat on?""
""I'm in bed.""
I looked down on the mattress and saw her lying there, but the hooded spectre still remained standing there. Just...standing. It didn't feel negative, or even really aware of us. I wondered if I was dreaming, was strangely calm and decided to just go to sleep. In retrospect I wonder why I didn't go screaming out of the room.
The next morning I told her about the strange dream, and she recalled the conversation exactly. She said that she thought it was strange but was so tired that she really didn't question it.
A few weeks later when I was walking out of my apartment an older woman from the neighborhood approached me. I live in a mostly Caribbean neighborhood and by and large people are mostly friendly, so I'm used to people coming up to say hello, evangelize, chat or what have you.
The woman asked me how long I'd been living in the apartment, was that corner one mine?
Yes, it was.
""How long has it been an apartment instead of a hospital?""
I wasn't sure. I'd only been there less than a year.
""My husband died a few years ago in that hospital.""
I told her that I was very sorry for her loss and offered to say a prayer for her husband.
""Ok honey, I'm going to say a prayer for you too. Because your apartment used to be the morgue.""
I got a cold chill. There had been a few other incidents between the hooded spectre and meeting this woman, but I'd just let them slide as an old building and an active imagination.

I'm not so sure anymore...

1354082617.0,26,self.Ghosts,13x6o5,"Apartment I lived in that everyone agreed was haunted. Of course, my room was the most active...",Numei,38,12,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/13x6o5/apartment_i_lived_in_that_everyone_agreed_was/,"This happened approximately 10 years before the incident I posted [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13tf77/a_brief_encounter_that_has_haunted_me_ever_since/). These are the only strange experiences I've had so, I don't think I'm a sensitive or anything I've just had bad luck I guess. 

The apartment in question was in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, on a street called Bruyere. In respect of the rules I won't mention the exact address but wanted to mention the street in case someone has had some experiences there and would like to pm me. In fact, I met someone in a bar who started telling me about this apartment they lived in that was haunted and it ended up being the one I had lived in. Since I'd tried to rationalize what I saw, I even went as far as theorizing that it might be the effects of infrasound, it didn't bring me comfort to hear similar accounts from other tenants.  

So where to begin. There were the random weekly incidents that my roommates and I all shared such as, lights flickering (one time my roommate was think it was a loose wire until he saw the switch go on and off), thinking someone was there when there wasn't, people thinking the place was covered in cobwebs then turning the lights on and seeing there were none, similarly there was one particular corner of the living room that people swore they saw some kind of cocoon thing clinging to but was gone when the lights went on, and overall just general bad vibes. Then there were my two out-and-out sightings. 

The first one happened as I just laid down for bed and looked up to see a solid green cloud hovering above me. As it got closer my face became increasingly cold and clammy. Then a loud yet distant whisper-shout ""DON'T!"" as the cloud lowered right onto me in a sudden final icy, clammy, chill. I ran to my roommates room gibbering ""A GHOST! I'VE SEEN A FRIGGIN' GHOST!"" My roommate sleepily told me to stop fucking around and let him get back to sleep. Then he heard my shivering, woke thoroughly, saw how pale I was, and took me out for a drink. He took me quite seriously, and it took awhile before we screwed up the courage to head back.   

The second time, although in some ways less alarming, had a clearer form. I had just turned off the lights in my room, and thought someone had hung a shirt on my wall and grabbed for it. My hand went right though it, and as it floated into the ceiling, I could see in more detail that it was a dress with lace frills lightly glowing green like the cloud I'd seen before. Another freak out and outing for drinks. 

The person I'd met later on who said they'd lived there and seen things, confirmed without any suggestion, that most of the activity had taken place where my room was. A wall of the room had been knocked out turning two rooms into a great-room but, the end of the great-room they'd seen things was where my room had been. The person didn't want to get into any details about what they'd seen.

1344330496.0,27,self.Ghosts,xtdhm,While at Waverly Hills...,dante8o,31,4,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/xtdhm/while_at_waverly_hills/,"I'm fortunate enough to live fairly close to Waverly Hills Sanatorium in Louisville, KY. I was about to go on one of their 2 hour tours, and this is what I experienced. A note about the tour before I make my list... We had about 20-25 people in the tour, so it was noisy. The people I went with stayed towards the back of the group to try and separate ourselves from the noise as much as possible. The rear tour guide allowed us to do this up to a point. Anyway... here we go...

* While waiting for our turn to enter the infamous room 502, we walked along a wall that had a room (which was being used for storage of lumber and what-not) and an elevator. As I walked past the storage room, I could hear a groaning/moaning sound coming from inside. It was faint. I stopped and listened. Someone else heard it too and asked me about it. I slowly walked inside the doorway of that room. I could still hear it, but it wasn't any louder or quieter. It wasn't constant, either. I wanted to ask what that room used to be, but by the size of it, I'm guessing it wasn't much more than a storage room. If you watched the live Ghost Hunters Halloween show from Waverly, Jason had the same experience (which was after I had been there). I nearly pissed myself watching him experience the same thing.

* As we were about to enter room 502, my friend (who was standing behind me) freaks out. She started going on and on about hearing someone say ""yes"" into her ear. She said it sounded like a whisper. She was right behind me, and we were at the tail end of the group. I played it off and assured her that it may have been picked up on camera, since I had it running. Well... I'll be damned if it didn't. Right before she freaks out, you can hear the word ""yes"" being whispered. 

* While the group took a smoke break on one of the outside areas of the room... maybe the 5th floor. It's been a long time. Anyway, since I don't smoke, I stood in one spot and focused on one area on the inside. I remember a faint light, probably ambient light, and I remember a ladder (6' folding ladder). After my eyes adjusted I started to see shadows move in front of the light. It was only about 50 ft from me, possibly a little more. No noise (that I could tell), no noticeable shape. Just blocking out the light. The whole time I stood there it may have happened a 10-12 times. Other people caught on to what I was doing, so they began to look and saw it too.

* Ok... here's the biggie. Being a bit of a skeptic at heart, looking back I even question myself, but I know what I saw was there... and here it is... On the 4th floor, down a hallway lined with patient rooms, we had a chance to walk down the hallway alone. We remained in view of the group, but it was abotu 20-30 feet down the hallway. Everyone had to turn off their cameras and lights, so the only light was the ambient light from the moon. Of course I offered myself as sacrifice to the TB ghosts. I make my journey down with nothing to note. I turn and head back. About 2/3 of the way back I can see something. I didn't turn my head (I didn't want to give anything away), but I CLEARLY saw a shadow lean out from one of the patient rooms. Only chest and head, like someone peaking out from a doorway. That shape was there, but no defined lines. No features. I also didn't want to look that way for fear of pissing myself. I stopped and asked the group if they saw anything around me. (Remember, I never turned my head) They confirmed what I saw. They saw it too. Told me where it was, the shape, and everything else that I saw. Now I had to make my move, since I couldn't stand there all night. I took a step and slowly turned my head toward my new friend. When I did, it darted back into the room. I quickly sped up so I was in line with the doorway to see if anything (anyone) was inside the room, but nothing. As I walked past the door, someone claimed that the shadow left the room and started to follow me. I didn't look back, and only one person saw it. 

All through the building, we kept feeling ""cobwebs"" on the back of our necks. We thought this was odd considering all the people that just walked through ahead of us. It could have been cobwebs, though. I do have a video uploaded to youtube of the moan from room (although you can't hear it unless you watch the original), the ""yes"" from outside 502, and something else that I can't remember right now. If anyone is interested in seeing it, I can link to it.

1348162213.0,27,self.Ghosts,1079nl,A poltergeist that follows my friend to every house he goes to.,wiistevenduda1,35,8,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/1079nl/a_poltergeist_that_follows_my_friend_to_every/,"I have been watching ghost shows a lot during my middle school years, wishing that I could experience a ghost for myself. Little did I know that someone I met in High School would allow me to not only experience a ghost but get object hurled at me when ever we stay over each others house. 

This started on April 3, 2011 ( he came over my house to watch a wrestling pay-per-view) when we went to go to sleep. We heard this very LOUD thumping noise repeatably for hours. We at first thought it was the people living in the upstairs apartment making the noise, however it sounded like it was coming from the cellar. It even threw a cd across the room. This bothered us so much that we went to go sleep in the living room. We still heard this thumping noise coming from the cellar. It was doing the thumping repeatably now. It finally stopped at 4 a.m. Keep in mind this 4 a.m. as its important later on in the story. My friend only went over my house one more time after this and nothing else happened. Now I don't think my house is haunted because I never experience anything paranormal in the years I lived there.

Activity picked up when I visited his house over the summer for a week. We where at his mother's boyfriend's house when this happened. He slept in his bed and I slept on the air mattress. As soon as we lay down, we hear the banging and thumping we heard from that night. Then, it started to throw objects from the room at me on the air mattress and at my friend (I was getting hit with most of the stuff though). It threw paintbrushes, magazines, rocks, something for clothes, my laptop, and the alarmclock. It took the fragrant spray for the hamster and was spraying us with that spray. We heard scratching on his bed but couldn't see any claw marks. It sounded like it was flicking my air mattress. All I saw was a black hand go and grab my face. It touched me in the head and poked me with paintbrushes. We thought that just the room was haunted after sleeping in it for 3 nights and the same things were happening. So we went into the living room to sleep and the ghost not only threw things but it moved the covers off me and it tugged on my pants and held them a ways away from me. And it punched me in my back twice.

After that my friend's mom and boyfriend slept in the living room with my friend and objects where hurled at them and the ghost touched the mother on her back. The boyfriend also got hit with objects. They also had a camera set up and it threw it. It also moved the couch.

My friend came over my house last weekend and DVD's, CD's, video game controllers, and my PS2 where all thrown at me. My friend bought a giant jaw breaker a while back and he brought it to my house. It was in a plastic bag and all we hear is 3 loud banging noises. Turns out that it was banging the jawbreaker against my bed post. So we put it in a plastic tote. Next thing we hear is the tote open and the bag of the jawbreaker. I ask my friend if it was in the tote and....it wasn't. This was the scariest moment of my whole life because this jaw breaker is big and heavy, and it will knock you out if it's thrown at you. We hid under our covers (which we do most of the time when this happens so we don't get really hurt) and it was lightly thrown at me. I shoved it into a drawer and it stayed there the whole night.  It also ripped one of my comic books, and used up my whole can of compressed air.

So far this ghost, which we nicknamed ""Thumper"" has haunted at 2 houses, My friend's mother's boyfriend's house and my house. However nothing like I described happens when my friend isn't there. And every time this ghost acts up, it stops at 4 a.m every time (except last weekend when it was tearing up my room it stopped at midnight for some reason).

This is the most I could remember off the top of my head by myself.

I am going over his house next weekend, I wonder what will happen next? I will update when I get back from there. Hopefully a friend of ours will be able to come to and see if anything happens.

[UPDATE:] Well I'm currently at my friends house right now. We are at my friend's house with another friend of ours. We go to sleep, my and our friend is sleeping on two different mattresses in an adjacent room of my friend's room. My friend is in his room and we turned the lights off and guess what.....shit was starting to get thrown at me and my our friend. Two little pumpkins, my friend's old cell phone,  little rocks, a little army guy, my friend's bed post top, a little metal trinket, shells (which were extremely warm), a paper towel roll (thrown 3 times), a little spray bottle with chemicals in it (which it sprayed once, we say it appear and disappear, then it was thrown at my friend), and my friend had a little fish hat which we saw float from the corner of the door frame and back. Then my friend took the hat and threw it at the closet door. He sits next to me and and we hear something move. He turns around and that hat is right behind him. Then we heard voices like growling and well just noises. We though it was the dog but we were feeling her stomach for vibrations and it wasn't her. There is a hole in the ceiling in the adjacent room (which has an unknown VHS in it behind the boards covering the hole) which the dog was growling at. All this activity stopped at around 2:30 A.M. but all of us woke up at around 4 at the same time. Now I have to sleep in this house tonight again, will update if anything else happens.

However during 2006, there was a city wide flood which required us to renovate out basement. It was this time that the experiences started picking up. The feeling of someone watching had grown immensely, especially in the gutted basement (which had always had a slight haunted feeling but nothing unbearable.) but now the upstairs started to come alive too. Most of the time it is like the ghost is just observing me, or maybe even scared of me. It always feels like there is someone standing at the doorway to the room I'm in just looking inside.

My first REAL experience (in this house) was during the renovations, (I was around 14-15 at the time) I heard a couple odd bangs in the house which I was alone in. Scaring me, I was briskly walking to the door (almost running) to play outside until my Mom came home from work. As I was running to the door a face appeared not even 2 inches from my face. I ran through it before I could stop, scaring me so much I fell backwards trying to stop. I gathered my things and didn't re-enter the house for a couple hours.

The next major experience was when my brother and I were sitting downstairs (after reno was complete) watching tv, when a teddy bear came rolling down the first part of the stairs (there is a landing near the top). Startled that someone was in my house we wait a couple min to see if we can hear anyone walking around. Nothing. So we slowly walk up the stairs to see the bear had fallen off a ledge, where to be honest it was peculiarly set. I ruled it out as just a natural thing as it was bound to fall eventually, but then, I looked over and saw my breadbox open, and a loaf of bread laying in the middle of the floor.

My next experiences were some of the scariest I had ever experienced. I was in my room trying to fall asleep as I had school in the morning but my sleep schedule was still set to weekend mode. My room in my house has only one window, and it leads to another room in my house, not outside. The room it leads to is my brothers, who was also trying to sleep. So I am laying in my bed wide awake for at least 30 min, I roll over and face the doorway to my room and I see a shadow that was darker than my dark room. It was shaped like a person just standing watching me in the doorway. I automatically think its my brother and I say, ""Evan, what are you doing?"" I get no response. So I say it again, ""Evan! What are you doing, why are you in my room?!"". Then I hear him from the next room ""I'm not! I'm sleeping, shut up!"" My heart stops, there is definitely a person standing there, with the natural sway a person would have if just standing there. My mind automatically comes to the conclusion someone has broken in the the house, the shadow looked so much like a person. I scramble and turn on the lamp a couple feet in my room,(in the process knocking over the table and breaking the glass cover on my lamp) and by the time I look up the shadow was gone.

My next experience was similar to the last. I was sleeping in my bed when I'm woken up by movement on my bed. I open my eyes and turn over to see the exact same black figure sitting on the side of my bed, a foot away from me. He stands up (which I can feel through my bed)and walks out my door.

These are just some of the more major experiences I have had in my house. I don't really know a lot of people I can tell about my experiences as they are either no believers or I don't want to scare when they stay at my house.

I have done some research on my house and there was a man, the owner of the house before the last, that died here. (We still get some of his mail years later)",,False,self,t5_2r1q4,False,,,True,t3_1fezcq,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/1fezcq/some_things_i_have_experienced_in_my_home/,

The reason why is after one night of especially bad paranormal activity in my house, I decided to make a truce with the ghosts.  I said outloud ""To all of the spirits in this house, I respect your right to be here.  I promise I will not bother you if you don't bother me.  So lets all just live here in peace"".  Since then, NOTHING of a ghostly nature has happened in the house in about a year.  Until last night. 

So last night I go down in the basement to do laundry.  In the basement there are two ceiling lights.  They're both the kind where it's just a lightbulb with a pull cord.  I turn on the one that's next to the washing machine only.  As I'm loading the machine I notice that the room suddenly gets brighter and I look up and see that now the other light is on and it's pull cord is swinging back and forth wildly.  Although I wanted to run out of there badly, I thought that running away in fear would just encourage or embolden the ghost.  So I did the best I could to fake calm as I left.  When I got upstairs I told my husband what happened and told him to make sure there was no one in the basement.  He did a thorough check and said there's no one.

Now, my husband doesn't believe in ghosts at all and is an atheist, but even he said there's no way to explain what happened other than that either it was a ghost or I'm playing a haox.  And my husband knows I wouldn't do this.  So even he is accepting the possibility of it being a ghost and he's never done that before.

I can't help but think that the ghost turned on the light because it wanted to send me some sort of message.  But why after a year long truce would this happen?  Is the message ""the truce is over""?  Another thing is that me and my husband have been talking about moving so maybe it's upset about that.  Or it could have just been trying to be helpful by turning on the other light for me.

1362493655.0,25,self.Ghosts,19pgyp,Experiences of my family and I.,BadIdeaBunny,30,5,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/19pgyp/experiences_of_my_family_and_i/,"This goes back to when my father was growing up. He lived in a house built to fit a family of 12 plus a very large basement. He remembered things going missing, fast running foot steps and giggling from a little girl. Original thought was it could have been one of his seven sisters. But their father, my Grampy, was a very abusive and strict man. If he had caught any one of them messing around he would break their fingers. The items that went missing were usually gifts, trinkets, jewelry etc. But once one of these items was gone, it was never to be seen again, no trace. 
 
Another experience of his was an old gentleman, he would hover over all the children as they were sitting at the dining room table or at the foot of their bed. He was a black mass with a top hat but his face was distinguished, he looked peaceful, almost as though he was watching over them all. They all have told me they felt him touch their shoulder, forehead or rub their back, and every time it would calm them down.
 
While us kids were growing up(and there were a lot of us as well) we would hear the foot steps and sometimes catch a glimpse of long flowing curls wrapping around a doorway. The old man however was only seen by one of my younger cousins, she said he would smile and watch her sleep. She was not scared of him, she only called him ""the man."" I felt presences in the house, but they never gave me anxiety, they only calmed my nerves and made me feel safe.
 
A few years after my grandparents sold the house my brothers and I became friends with the kids that moved in to the same house, they had also encountered these spirits. Their recollection however was different. They heard screaming of a little girl and stomping, almost as though she was having a fit. The old man however would only show his face and his hat, not his body. He would only linger at the doorstep with a depressed somber look on his face, they never saw him inside the house. They even told us he had spoken to them and said they were not welcome there.

Now to speak of the house I grew up in, which was a five minute walk down the road from my grandparents house. I remembered heavy foot steps back and forth on the upper floor or in the attic. Sometimes we would hear someone walk all the way down our long staircase but stop at the very bottom. We would also hear dogs pacing back and forth in our porch room whining and whimpering, also scratching at the door. When we opened the door nothing would be there, and it would drive our dogs crazy. 

Also our ceiling fan light which was a dimmer would randomly turn on and off regardless of whether it was turned on. That could have been easily explained by an electrical problem, but my dad was a very capable handyman and nothing he did worked.One day the fan was speeding up to incredible speed and the light went on and off over and over. My mother got up, stood in the middle of the room, screamed, cursed and hollered at whatever the hell it was that was doing it. It stopped dead, never to this day has happened again(which is strange because the house has more electrical problems now than ever before).

 We did have some visuals in the house, but not many. One day I was coming down the stairs to get breakfast. I was quite young, but I remember exactly what I saw. Passing my brothers room I saw a young blonde boy floating above my brothers bed(matching the description of my brother) He looked right at me and laughed as if he was having the most fun in his life. I bolted down the stairs stomping with every step and screamed at my mother ""How come HE can fly and I CAN'T!!!???"" while pointing at my brother who was sitting on the couch. I didn't clue in that he couldn't have been in both places but I was seriously pissed. A few years later my oldest brother was in our basement practicing karate on his punching bag and decided to take a break and light something on fire for some reason. His eyes darted to the room in the far corner and he turned completely pale. A man was sitting on his bed (it was his room at the time) with long white hair and a long white beard wagging his finger as if to say ""You shouldn't be doing that."" My brother was terrified and ran upstairs, it took him a while to go back down there and he mover his things back up stairs.

 This all felt normal to me for some reason, but one thing freaked me out every time beyond belief. There was an opening under our stairs that looked right in to the basement stairwell and it creeped the fuck out of me, not to see it it just felt creepy. Every night before bed I would grab a glass of water turn off all the lights behind me and begin to walk up the stairs, but I swear I would feel something cold either grab my ankle, grab my shoulders or grab my throat. When this happened I would cry uncontrollably for a couple seconds while I ran as fast as I could up the stairs. When I would go to bed I would watch the walls bleed to black from one corner to the other, so black it looked like a void. It filled me with terrible fear, something wanted me to know it was there.

When I was about eight or nine, something wicked happened. I was pillow fighting with my dog, she loved pillow fights for some reason, and then all of a sudden she stopped, her eyes looked behind me with a glaze over them and all of a sudden something grabbed the back of my head and slammed my face into the exposed wooden chair arm. It chipped a good portion of my tooth off and my dog started whining and licking me. my mom was convinced I fell or that the dog had jumped on my back. But it was very real, in fact about a year ago, what felt like the same force slammed my head in to the corner of a doorway, it gave me a concussion and rattled my brain for about a week.

When I was around eleven or twelve I was very lonesome. my father and oldest brother had moved away, my other brother wanted nothing to do with me and my mother was fully submerged with her new boyfriend. I cried almost every night just wanting someone to care about me and then all of a sudden I began seeing that black  mass form again. But this time, I felt my feet being massaged, a graze on my cheek, a kiss on my forehead. This went on for a few years and when I was about thirteen I felt a kiss on my lips. I could have easily imagined it all, it was a concentrated tingle, almost like static electricity, but it kept me feeling safe, loved and happy, so I am grateful.

Other insignificant things have happened, but this is already too long. Thanks for letting me share.

It is a two story home, to go upstairs you go up seven steps, then there is a small landing, then 7 more steps up to the top floor.

Within days of purchasing the home, I noticed movement on that landing. Nothing was actually there, but something kept catching my eye.  About a year later, I noticed my husband do a quick glance up the landing. I asked him if he thought he saw something and he said yes.  So we both shared our stories about the movement - turns out we both had the exact same feeling.  It was a ghost of some sort, a young girl, and she was completely harmless.  Neither of us are spiritual whatsoever, but neither of us seemed to think it was odd that the other thought the same thing about the ghost, who I'll call The Girl from now on.

Over the years we have noticed company looking suddenly up the landing. Some we've asked if they thought they saw something and when they said yes, we've told them about The Girl.  I can count 7 people who have told us they've seen 'something'.  We still see her, about 5 times a week between us.

There is no other explanation for the movement. It's not light from anywhere, it's not something blowing...we've looked at all the possibilities.  

NOW. This is where things get crazy.  A couple of years ago at my daughter's birthday party (she was turning 10) I overheard a conversation between her and one of her friends.  Her friend said 'did you know you have a sister?'. I have one daughter and two sons...so no, no sister.  The friend went on, 'yeah, you did have a sister. She died before you were born'.  She was saying this like it was just a boring old fact. My daughter got a weird look on her face and just changed the subject.  I was stunned. Absolutely stunned.  Because when my husband was in his early 20's, his girlfriend got pregnant and aborted the pregnancy.  

What do you think?

I worked at the theatre on campus. Every single person who has spent time there has some sort of story of a haunting. 

I was working in the theatre past midnight one night. A few of my friends were with me. I walked past the room that holds the electronics for the building and see a man at the end of the hall. I go back a few steps and no one is there. The room does lead to the maintenance man's office but it is too late at night for him to be in. 

Another time I was alone working in the costume shop reupholstering some chairs. I was kneeling on the floor cutting some fabric when I hear footsteps behind me and someone touch my back. I turn to see if it was someone I knew who came in late to work but no one was there. I immediately left and didn't come back until the next day when I knew people would be in. 

Another night I was working late with one of my friends. We were sitting on the stage painting. We started hearing footsteps in the skywalks above us. The roof settles a lot but this was much different. We hear running around on the walks but no one was up there. We would have had to see someone walk up there from where we were. 

The creepiest by far I did not witness but many of my co workers did. They were working over spring break to finish up the set and suddenly they hear drums coming from the orchestra pit. The drumming has been heard before but never this much or this loudly. The pit is always kept empty of all instruments unless we are doing a musical (which we were not). And the only way to get to the pit is to crawl through a small tunnel in the costume shop. Much too hard to get a drum in there. The drumming continues on and off for the next few days. Finally, my friend has her dad who is a pastor come in and pray over the theatre. The drumming immediately stops and has not been heard since.   

Other than these experiences many others have been working and all the lights went off or blink on and off. Many others have been touched. I have since graduated but I'm sure the experiences have continued since I have left.

My Grandma Helen practically raised me, and when she died in 2009 I felt as if my mother had died. She was 89, and was taking a nap while I cooked dinner for us when she passed, so there was no violent trauma involved or anything.

About a month after she had gone, the kitchen sink started acting up, and my (then) boyfriend Richard and I were working side by side, him plunging one side of the sink and me bailing on the other. After 15 minutes or so of this frustrating activity, I heard my Grandma's voice call ""Sarah?"" from the direction of the house that her room was in (the tone of her voice was questioning, like ""Sarah? Are you there?""). 

Well, it wasn't a shout, and it was just the one word, but even over the fixing of the sink the sound was plain as day. I just froze, and turned to look at Richard. Even as weird as the situation was, I kept silent and remember thinking to myself ""let HIM be the one to mention it - 1. So I know I'm not crazy, and 2. So I won't be implanting suggestions into his head"". So I look over at Richard, and he says, ""did you hear that?"". LOL what an overwhelming relief that was! 

Of course, we went to her old room and walked through the small house, but that was it. I had always teased her that when she died, she'd have to come visit me. I honestly believe now that she did. Richard was a lot more traumatized by it than I was, as his world view doesn't make allowances for anything illogical... I'm so thankful that this experience was shared, because what they say is true: nobody will ever really believe stuff like this, until it happens to them.

I have never sought out anything paranormal, nor gone out of my way to learn much about it.

A lot of the TV shows that are on, I think are full of crap, I don't buy into 'orbs' or shadow people, because there is just too simple an explanation for things like that ( dust floaters in the air for example, or someone walking past a light in the other room throws an odd shadow) and I don't really believe when I see that someone got 'scratched' that a ghost did it--however, there are certain stories and pictures that I have seen and heard that I do not believe can be explained by anything other than the paranormal.

I have had two strange experiences in my life that I feel there is no rational explanation for:


I was house sitting with my then GF, and we were going to bed for the evening. I had literally just closed my eyes...I started to have a very uncomfortable feeling of being watched, like there was a presence in the room, but nothing was there...my eyes popped open...I could feel the presence in the room coming from near the foot of the bed. Before I could say anything, she asked me, 'hey do you feel like we should leave?"" Before she could finish asking the question, I had already answered with an emphatic ""YES"" and was up out of bed, getting dressed. The fact that we both had a very unwelcome, 'being watched' type of feeling at the exact same time would indicate to me that there was something beyond the realm of normal explanation going on. I have never felt that uncomfortable, or unwelcome in any place that I have ever been, before or since--It was so strange, because we both felt it coming from the same spot in the room, and felt it at exactly the same time.

Later on, we looked up the history of the houses' previous owners. No one had lived in the house for more than two years since the 1960's. We plan on contacting whoever we can find, and asking about similar experiences.

A janitor was killed in an accident in the boiler room, a girl fell down the steps in the middle of the building and died, and a boy in the gym (don't know how). Gary (my best friend) and I had some off time because Dean (our neighbor) had to wait for a mold to dry on one of the dummies he made. Dean left to go pick up tools so me and Gary were the only two in the building. We went to the gym to play racquetball and went into the equipment room that had a bunch of stuff neatly stacked in it and grabbed the only two racquets and the only 2 racquetballs and went out and played. As I was hitting my ball I saw something out of the corner of my eye and glanced over only to see nothing, but in the split second that I looked away the ball disappeared. We looked around for a while and then decided to look by the equipment room to see if it rolled by the doors... it didn't. At this point we're really freaked out because we know the history, but I'm still skeptical. We couldn't find it so we opened the door to the equipment room to find EVERYTHING that was neatly on the shelves all over the floor BUT that one racquetball.

My dad passed away in 2009 when I was 16. He'll be the guy in blue.

In October of 2010 my friend and I both saw something very strange in the sky on a ride home one night. It was a bright light that would split up into 3 or 4 lights spontaneously. We followed the light for 30 minutes and eventually pulled over on the side of the road as it flew right over our heads. We both snapped pictures of the strange thing in the sky and flipped shit when we looked at them... We both captured the bright light and what looks like a face that is eerily similar to my dad's. My friend looked at me and said, ""That's your fuckin' dad, holy crap."" Another strange coincidence... This happened on my dad's birthday, October 3rd. 

Here is a picture of my dad and the picture I took on my iPhone of the ufo/ghost thing:

I had been thinking that the ghost was upset because we were planning on moving.  Well, the offer we made on a house was rejected and we've decided to wait until next spring to buy a new house, so we'll be here for a while.  

Something new is that I could hear whistling coming from the basement.  There basically isn't any soundproofing between the basement and the first floor, so I could hear it perfectly.  I looked to see if there was anyone outside that could be causing it but didn't see anyone.  It was dead quiet in the house.  I listened intently to try to see if I could recognize the tune but couldn't.  It was definitely a song, but not a song I had ever heard before.  This went on for probably three minutes then stopped.  This happened a few days ago.

Today I went in the basement to do laundry and heard the whistling down there with me.  It was sort of like a song, but would get cut-off repeatedly.  It stopped as soon as I got to the stairs.  It was definitely a human-sounding whistle.  

With everything that's been happening, I have a really hard time going into the basement now.  Most times I just can't get myself to go down there and have to have my husband do the laundry.  I definitely wont go down at night.  I have no idea why the basement has become such a hot zone of paranormal activity.  I would really like it to stop.

I work for a DPW on Cape Cod, this particular town on Cape is filled with Native American legends and history. I work with Natives from the Mashpee Wampanoag tribe and they are firm believers in spirits and other things paranormal.  
This happened almost two years ago, mid November of 2010. We were clearing an access way for the Fire Department off a road called [Mashpee Neck Rd]( http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=643&amp;q=mashpee+neck+rd.&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=0x89e4d2f03dec375f:0x67cb8310849bfb93,Mashpee+Neck+Rd,+Mashpee,+MA+02649&amp;gl=us&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iwIsUKSHDsid6AG-n4CgAw&amp;ved=0CAcQ8gEwAA) the *A* is actually exactly where the fire lane starts. It was to be a 15 ft wide path for the Fire Department to have access to in case of emergency to the river. 
We cut all the trees down and layed them to each side of the path to be chipped, at the end we made a big circle, probably 100 feet wide to allow any fire trucks to be able to turn around. I was with my foreman and two other laborers one being 100 percent Native American. 
Just as we started chipping I turned to get a branch to throw into the chipper and I saw, clear as day what I would describe as a Native American woman and her child standing in full deer skin cloth staring at me right in the eyes. They were within 100 feet of me down a small hill. 
Just as I turned to tell my foreman to check out these people in the woods, they were gone. I didn't think anything of it, thought I was just seeing things and told my foreman nevermind. 
As we continued I felt this intense heavy feeling of depression come over me. I wanted to cry, and thinking about it to this day makes me sad and I tear up. We stop for our 9:30am coffee break and shut everything down. This feeling is just growing and getting worse. 
I start to tell everyone what I saw. Just as I finish telling them about the woman and child, we all witness an intense ball of light coming from across the river, roughly 100 yards away. This light was HUGE, it was a bright white-yellow in the middle with a blue ring on the outside. It was midway up the trees on the opposite side of the river and it moved left to right up the river and disappeared into the woods. 
Just as soon as the light disappeared we all heard drums beating in the same direction that the light was coming from. These drums were deep and they went off in beats of three for 10 minutes or so. We all sat and listened, no one said a word. 
This area of the woods there is no houses at all. It's all conservation land and has been untouched for a long time. The Native who was working with us told us it was tradition to bury people along the river. 
We continued chipping and I still had this depressed feeling, but the further we got away from the river, it subsided. Just as we were out of sight of the river, this intense rush of heat came over my back. This was hot, like I was standing with my back to a fire. I could feel the heat through my jacket and sweatshirt and it went away. I felt nothing after that. 
Clearly something was not happy with us working near that river. 

I've been there a few times since, had some more things happen, done some research and had tribe members tell me some strange stories as well. I didn't believe much in anything paranormal before this, but now I know beyond any doubt that there are some things that happen in those woods that I cannot explain.

Real life haunting,Ikeytski,31,8,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/wt1mq/my_horror_story_growing_up_real_life_haunting/,"Ok so let me start off by saying i am a christian and im sorry if anything i say comes off as a bit religious. Im just telling the story as is it!

When i was about 4 or 5 i began to see things in the middle of the night. Shadow like figures flying across my bed. Loud noises. I would hear voices talking in the middle of the night whispering. I once saw a shadow like figure pull out a white sword and aim it at me. Needless to say i kept pretty quiet about it and i was scared shitless if i was ever alone. Showers were pretty scary up until i was about 13. This minor activity keep going on until about the age of 7 or 8 when i would feel something invisible poke my forehead in the middle of the night. i would wake up not see anything and i ignored it for a very long time. This got worse and lights began to flicker on and off in the middle of the night and my mom came in one time and saw the lights having issues. We unplugged my lights and i didnt have an issue that night. I was so scared at this point by everything i was seeing i was sleeping in my moms bed until the age of 12. But ill continue.

Around the age of 9 or 10 when i was sleeping with my mom i saw something down the hallway. There was a giant fire in the middle of the hallway!! i woke my mom up immediately and told her the house was burning!! SHE DID NOT SEE A DAMN THING! as i stared at this fire for long amounts of time the fire would start to shift into a man like figure. I kept waking my mom up and she kept saying she didn't see anything. I eventually got to sleep.

I told my grandmother my stories the next day only to find out my grandmother was the local exorcist for our church and she would teach me how to take care of things in the house. She taught me how to bless the house and how to tell the things in the house to leave. She told me stories of things that would grab her in the middle of the night and how she never had anyone to help her because her parents were Lutheran. Me and her did the blessings and everything was gone! i swear by it i have not had many issues since then. The shadows stopped the things stopped poking me the lights havent had any issues.

But every now and then something will get knocked over in them middle of the night or a door will open by itself and i have to stay strong and confident that god will take care of it. (sorry to get religious its how i feel and it works)

My grandmother told me that in the bible they describe spiritual gifts that effect us all. She said they are passed down from generation to generation, and the one i got was called ""Discerning of spirits"". Its where a person can see and sense spirits outside of our world. (I have seen angels and good things as well). But my mother and grandmother would tell me stories of when i was very young and how i would go into a store and stand in front of Aztec or ""bad spirited"" objects and i would say my tummy wouldn't feel good and that i didn't like the object even though i had no knowledge of it.

I just wanted to finally share my story and i hope people have some info to give and i would love to talk about this with other people.

TLDR; I would see things in the night. Saw a fire no one saw in the middle of my house. Grandmother was exorcist. Taken care of.",,False,self,t5_2r1q4,1342681596.0,,,True,t3_wt1mq,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/wt1mq/my_horror_story_growing_up_real_life_haunting/,

Images of death, torture and other terrible things. The nightmares finally ended about a week later, but I'll describe proceeding events...

The dreams consisted of being chased around various hallways, and massive rooms, each with different instruments of torture. Always being followed by the same creature, a large stick like structure, with long jagged fingers that floated more than walked, and to top it off had a mask much like this... 

http://www.masksz.com/images/japanese-mask/japanese-mask-3.jpg

I was seeing various people I've not recalled meeting, all being tortured in different ways in front of me. Everytime I would stop to help the masked creature would catch up and impale me more and more. This was not a dream I could wake up from. Upon running for what felt like forever, I was finally pinned against a wall where I was forced to face the creature. He grabbed me and lifted me, and before I knew it I was awake. I remember looking around the room terrified of what had happened. As I was calming down I could see in the ceiling what appeared to be a mask looking at me, I screamed immediatly recognizing what had followed me. 

My mom heard the scream and rushed to my room, and turned on the lights and asked me what was wrong. I told her about my dream and what I had saw on the ceiling. Afterwords to help my calm down, my Mom told me she would run me a bath as it always calmed me down. After I stripped down there was all kinds of cuts and scrapes on my body, the doctor prescribed it as something caused by night terrors, me scratching myself. As for some small pinholes/bites, he suggested a new bed as he felt they may be bed bugs.

I've recently started working at a store in my hometown rumored to be haunted.
Many people have offered money to stay the night in the store, and a team of ghost hunters
actually made a movie about the store. I'm just going to share a few of my own personal experiences
and a few stories and background of the store.


One of the first things I did when I started working was get the grand tour from one of the other employees. Upstairs there is a room where the previous owner used to live, and supposedly died in. The store actually consists of 2 buildings that were combined from remodeling. One side was a mortuary, where they had planned funerals and prepared the bodies. The location is also the location where an old Indian burial ground used to be (I know that part seems cheesy, but it's what I was told).


My first experience with the ghosts was later one night at around 8:30 pm, the store was about to close and it was only 3 of us employees working. We were all sitting around the front counter watching tv not expecting any customers for the rest of the night. Earlier in the evening someone had taken some flyers out of a cupboard on the opposite side of the room and left the door open right by the stairs to where they previously had kept the coffins (where it's rumored to be haunted). All of a sudden the cupboard door slammed shut with a loud noise that caught all of our attention. No one said anything for about 4 or 5 seconds then we looked at each other wondering if that really did just happen. Nothing else strange happened that night, and I sort of waved it off as possibly just an odd draft (sometimes the wind can come in from the upstairs and blow down the stairs making a very cool current through the store).


The next thing I experienced was upstairs, in the room where we keep our rental equipment. When sizing a couple up for their boots, the skis had been set against the wall on the opposite side of the room. This could have been chance, but both pairs of skis all of a sudden came crashing down on the ground and were spread out on the floor. They didn't slide against the wall because they were leaned against a shelf, they had appeared to been thrown off the wall.


The next and last of my personal stories was again later at night this time at around 8 pm. This happened just a week or so ago. Again we had just 3 people in the store. The scheduled manager couldn't close for whatever reason so we were left in charge for the last hour, and while we were leaving after locking up the store and shutting down the lights, there were definite footsteps heard from upstairs. We have wooden floors, and it was definitely footsteps. The creaks were timed out, you could tell it wasn't a person because you couldn't hear the sound of shoes, just the wood creak. My coworker looked at me and I back at him, and asked if I had heard them and I said yes. We knew no one was here because we had checked the entire store, and so we locked up and left.


This story actually comes from my mom, who had been in the store years ago before I can remember. She was upstairs, where we have the used equipment and where the caskets were held. She had heard someone coming upstairs, an employee checking to see if she needed help and then he went back downstairs. A few minutes later she heard more footsteps coming up the stairs but no one had come up, and no one went down. She blew it off, not quite sure if she had heard something or if it was someone coming up and back down, but then she saw it. She saw a figure, a woman, in a white dress, with dark hair walk across the room from the stairs and open the door to the other room, go right through the doorway and then the door swung shut. She just stared at it as it crossed the room, knowing that the place was rumored to be haunted and never really believing in ghosts before. She never told me that until I started working there.

1346850878.0,18,self.Ghosts,ze3gw,My parents house has ghosts (few different experiences),miggle72,25,7,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/ze3gw/my_parents_house_has_ghosts_few_different/,"So. I don't really know where to start. I'm just going to write what i can remember and hope it makes sense.

My parents house was/is a happy home. It really was. Lived there was my dad, my mum and my three brothers. I was the youngest in the home. It all started from..i can't even remember when but every night, without fail i would wake up at 4am. The room would be deadly silent and cold. I wouldn't feel scared, but just a little odd. I don't know how it got brought into conversation but one day it did. My brothers said they all experienced the same thing, at the same time.
I also used to see a middle aged man. i would never see his face, he would be bald and had a black jacket on and i would occasionally see him out the corner of my eye walking through the hallway, it was weird. But once again i was never scared of him. There never has been any reason for me too.

One time me and my mum had stayed up watching a movie. Realising it was quite late we decided to get ready to go to bed. I went to get a glass of water from the kitchen and heard my mum going up the stairs. I followed shortly after and whilst i was climbing the stairs i saw my mum go into the conservatory which i thought was rather odd. I started shouting ""mum"" to get her attention but nothing, she just carried on walking in there, so i shouted ""mum"" again louder. To which she replies from upstairs...in her bedroom. By this point my eyes watered so bad and i just ran straight to her room and told her what happened. She went down to check but nothing, no one. That scares me every time i think about it because i've never seen a ghost...or whatever it was open a door or touch anything. By the way, this happened at 4am.

Another time me and my mum were up late whist she was cutting and colouring my hair for me, as we were both night owls if you haven't noticed. Sitting on the floor whilst watching tv i had a sudden feeling of silence. Even though the tv was on and my mum was chatting away with me...the room just went silent and cold. I decided to not say anything and just ignore my feelings, i figured if i just ignored it, it would go away. All of a sudden my mum starts giggling to herself. I asked her what was up and she just says without batting an eyelid ""he's here"" My eyes started watering and i felt like running away haha. But we ended up making light of it. Because even though you can sense it, he's never actually done anything to harm any of us. I think whoever it is, hes just stuck. OH and it was at 4am this all happened.

The last experience i will speak of is i went to visit my parents not long ago and i was talking to my mum on her bed, i ended up falling asleep on top of the covers while she watched tv. Actually i don't know if i should say asleep, i was in that state of half asleep half awake. I opened my eyes and all i could see was this black...thing above me. It looked like a whirlpool of black squiggly things getting bigger and closer to my face and i swear to you, i have never felt fear like i have that night. i instantly went from being half asleep on my mums bed to running out of her room screaming for my life and i locked myself in the bathroom. All of while this was happening my three brothers ran to my aid to see what was one. One of my brothers however was shouting ""GET THEE HENCE"" When i had calmed down i sat down with my brother and asked him why he said that. I am telling you guys the truth when i say this. His reply said as soon as he heard my screams he got this feeling of utter and complete dread all over him. Not scared for me, but dread. I asked why he felt dread and he said he knew i had seen something bad. I told him i was half asleep and seen something coming at me from the ceiling and he said he saw the same thing...finding this hard to believe i asked him to draw what he saw and i would draw what i saw and then show them to each other. WE DREW THE SAME FREAKING THING. By the way, this happened at 4am.

A little background: In 2010, i moved in with my now fiance. He has lived in this house since he moved down to our city when he was about 8. His father, whom i have never met, died a few years back from a stroke.

And now for some of my experiences. A few months after i moved in, around Thanksgiving and Christmas, things started happening. One night my fiance and I were having a midnight cigarette and had to lean out of the sliding side doors since it was raining. He went to bed first and I was still finishing. I was facing the front windows of the house and we had a small light on in the kitchen. As i was finishing my smoke, i looked at one of the windows and i swear i was staring at a figure. There were no features, but an outline of a body and what seemed to be a cane. Now here's the weird part. A few days later i asked my fiance if his dad ever used a cane. He told me later in life he did after his first stroke and asked me why i wanted to know. Like i said, i never met this man in life.

Around the same time, closer to Christmas, were going to sleep. I had a bunch of papers from class on my nightstand and computer desk. I had heard shuffling and as i am a light sleeper, i laid there trying to figure it out since we had no animals living with us at the time and there was no vent near the papers. I was exhausted so I shrugged it off and tried to fall asleep. It was extremely hot so i threw the comforter off and had the sheet on me, pulled up to my shoulder. I finally got comfortable and was about to pass out when the sheet was yanked down! We were both not moving so it was not us. Of course, i woke up my fiance and told him and he said yeah it was probably dad. I sleep topless so he made jokes that he was trying to see my breasts.

On Valentines Day last year, i wanted to do something different for my fiance. I bought a cute see through dress and cooked dinner for him when he got home from work. I went up behind him, hugged him, and were talking when all of a sudden the end of the dress(which was barely covering my bottom) was flipped up onto my back. Of course I jumped up and my fiance asked what was wrong so i told him. He laughed and said it was definitely his dad.

That's all my experiences...for now.

Now this is one of the last World War Two era heavy cruisers in existence today. Although it never saw any battle it saw a lot of death. If you look up this stuff you guys can verify this information. It took part in humanitarian efforts in Greece in the 1953 earthquake. They brought men, women, and children aboard for treatment. Usually only bad cases were brought aboard (the Salem had the best doctors and surgeons in the fleet). Many of those people never made it off the ship alive. There have been many other cases of death on board as well. But here is the creepy part. This actually happened last night (Friday 7/27) we had a night tour on the ship and I was helping with security and needed to do a sweep of the ship to make sure all the guests had left. Now the ship has two hallways running from bow to stern both on the starboard and port sides. There are several small hallways that run in-between these hallways. I wanted to see something substantial (the Salem is a known haunted location and has been visited by literally everyone in the paranormal field). So I started provoking things by yelling and I of course was still making sure that no one was left on board. I was towards the back of the ship and going by the last junction between the two hallways and on the other side was a tall, lanky man staring back at me. This man was fucking scary. He had a very sunken face and looked pissed; almost to say that it was indeed his ship and not mine (that's what I was saying). He looked like a middle-aged man and was dressed in what looked like a one-piece jump suit/ flight suit. It was a darkish grey or green in color. This whole incident lasted all of three seconds, but it is burned into my psyche. I was shocked and startled and realized that this man could have been a guest. I ran down the hallway (about 7 feet in length) and looked both ways; he was nowhere to be seen. I continued around the corner the only place he could have gone. There was again nothing. So I decided to conclude my sweep and promptly left the ship, realizing I got exactly what I wished for.

I've lived in this apt for a little more than 6 months and have had a few unusual things happen, but nothing you couldn't explain 'in theory"". Last night was different. I took my dogs out and my son was in the apt alone. it was very quiet and he could hear someone or something in my bedroom jump off the bed and walk towards the bathroom door. it freaked him out enough for him to run out of the apt. Meanwhile I came back in (missing him go out the front door) and when I came in the apt every light was on (which aggravated me because I thought it was my son). I called out to him (not knowing he had fled the building) saying ""seriously why did you leave all the lights on?). I thought I was talking to him in the bathroom because the light was on and the water was running. I looked all over the apt for him saying ""ok, jokes up"" but he wasn't there. When he came back upsatirs he was with my husband who was just getting home from work. I opened the door for both of them and said"" really you turned ALL the lights on, left the water running?"" My son told me what happened and that he got freaked out hearing the noises and footsteps in the bedroom that he left immediately and went outside to wait for my husband. He said he didn't touch a light (most were off when I took the dogs out because I dont believe in spending money wasting energy), he didn't turn on the faucet, didn't throw the shower curtian back. My son took a picture of my bedroom last night after this happened and everything looked normal in the picture with the exception of my night stand. It was completely warped looking. I've heard weird frequency noises come out of my alarm clock that almost sound like sentences in the middle of the night. The alarm clock sits on top of this night stand. The other picture he took the bedroom looked normal except for a weird distortion that looked as if it was from behind the open door looking around it at us. I can't explain any of this except to believe that we might have some paranormal activity going on. It would make sense with some of the other things that have happened in the last 3 months. Even my dogs on occasion will stare at one spot in the apt and either growl or wimper as if they see something. This is my first post to reddit because I really don't know how to get any answers to this. Any advice or comments would be appreciated. I am NOT making any of this up so please refrain from smart a#$ comments. Thanks!

I was studying abroad in Germany with a group of other college students. Five of us were on a train from Amsterdam back to Bielefeld after a weekend trip. The train was packed, so we all ended up having to sit in different cars. I was between two cars, sitting on the floor with my back to the wall. Everyone in my little area was either sleeping or being very quiet. Over the sound of the track below me, I heard a whisper in my ear saying my name, ""Dave."" I didn't know anyone sitting around me and I am sure none of them knew my name. I immediately had a feeling of terror come over me. All I could think at that moment was that I had to get home and fast. After the train stopped, I rushed to grab the closest street car back to my bus route. I didn't even stop to meet back up with my friends before jumping on the car. After I finally got off of the last bus on what seemed to be the longest trip back to my host-parents, I walked into the house. My host family was sitting in the living room looking very sad. My host mother stood up and muttered in German, ""Call your family."" When I got a hold of my dad, he told me that my brother, a Ranger serving in Baghdad at the time, had been killed by a suicide bomber. The news was absolutely crushing. My brother and I had been best friends our entire life. He had died the night before I heard the news. None of us had a cell phone, so my host parents weren't able to contact me. I still believe that before he left, my brother made one last stop to say ""goodbye.""

TL;DR: I heard my name being whispered to me, just before I found out that my brother had been killed in Iraq.

I ask her where on the bed and she shows me, so I place a hand on the spot she showed me and its ice cold, so I place the other hand on a random spot on the bed just to make sure I am not imagining it and of course I am not. 
I walk out of the room and back in it, and I am surprised by the temperature difference of the hallway right outside the door and the room, it was very noticeable. 

But things calm down and I assure my wife there is nothing to be worried about. But I am freaking the fuck out inside, because I have experienced things in the same part of the house also. I did not want to freak my wife out so I didn't tell her anything at that time. 
These events happened so sporadically and with so much time in between that it was easy to convince myself that I have just imagined it. 

My last two events. 
One happened a few months ago, where I have seen someone pass the hallway towards the bedroom from my peripheral vision. It scared the crap out of me, because it was weird and for some reason I had a feeling that it was a woman. I got up turned on all the lights because it felt safer and after a few days of no other happenings I convinced myself that I imagined it. 

About two weeks ago, I my wife and daughter where sleeping in the bedroom and I was on the computer browsing the web, when suddenly i hear 2 female voices talking in the bedroom and I was thinking ""who the fuck is my wife talking to"" I get up walk to the bedroom and nothing is there both my wife and daughter are sleeping peacefully. I think its weird, but decide that my wife must have been talking in her sleep and the baby monitor thru which i heard the voices must have warped the sound somehow for it to seem like there is two voices. What they were saying I don't know, but i was expecting to find my wife standing above the crib showing our baby to someone who thought it was cute. 

AND now just 20 minutes before I started writing this, my wife is in the bedroom when she calls me to tell me that a feemale voice just called her name. which is when i told her about my experiences.

I am freaked out now. WTF? 

The house is new, well 11 years old but we are the only family that ever lived in it. I was even present during the construction. 
We do/did hear stuff banking and other strange noises but never thought anything of it. Like we will lay down for bed and something would crash somewhere in the house, after investigating i could not find what it was but i usually just dismissed it.

I never really got to know my grandfather. Sure, I'd come visit with my family every now and then. But I guess I've never been ""close"" to him. So, first things first. My grandpa was a smoker, a big one at that. I remember everytime we'd visit he'd have a pipe or cigar in his mouth. I didn't think much of it to be honest (Both my parents smoked, although my mother was pregnant at the time with twins) but it wasn't until my grandpa died of cancer that things started happening. From what I can remember it started with the phone calls. Sometimes there would be 3-5 a day. My mom or step-dad would answer them and no one would be on the other line. I remember my parents discussing it and how eerie it was. This continued on for awhile until we decided to get our home phone removed. Then it got even weirder, see the grandfather clock would go off when it wasn't supposed to and lights would start magically turning on and off in the hallway. It was then that it started affecting me. I remember one night I was laying in bed and suddenly heard footsteps in my room. I was petrified, I couldn't move! Then the freaking handle to my dresser would start to jingle. Being nine years old, I was already afraid of the dark so this just made everything worse. Haha, I'd sleep in my parents room for weeks I was so afraid of my room. Now from what I remember. All this didn't happen all at once. It was random and would stretch on for several months (this was during late 2004, early 2005) Some weeks we'd experience activity, some weeks nothing happened. But it wasn't until the beginning of july  that my mother gave birth to my twin sisters prematurely. After that everything stopped and nothing has happened since then. The creepiest part about it?

I lived in this older house that at one point in time was, I believe, a catholic sorority house (there was old, faded paint above the main entryway where a religious emblem had been removed off the house) that was across from Gunter Hall on the UNC campus. I have experienced ghosts all my life but nothing compared to what happened there...
There were three events in particular that I'll never forget. I'll preface these by telling you I lived in the basement, there were pipes for plumbing that you had to duck around that ran most of the ceilings and had to be careful to avoid lest you knock yourself out. The first thing that happened was late at night. I had just finished watching some television in the living room, turned off the tv and started going down the steps to my room in the basement. Halfway down the steps I got chills and felt the hair on my neck stand up, somehow I knew someone was watching me from the top of the steps. As I turned around it was like the ghost, or entity, or whatever it was knew I was aware of it and tried to move into the living room to avoid being seen. However, before it did I saw a grey hand quickly disappear through the doorway (minus the door). I got the vibe it didn't want to be seen...shaken, I went to bed and tried to get some sleep.
  Not long after this first occurrence my good friend and roommate,  another friend, and myself were in the living room sitting at a table playing some cards. Both of them were sitting with their backs to the kitchen, which was separated from the living room by a hallway that ran from the doorway, went right, then to the steps the went to the basement. I felt that sensation again that I was being watched and looked up. This time I saw what I think was a full body apparition. Her hair was floating out away from her head, she wore what I guess would be a night gown and her toes were dangling almost touching the floor and again, she was entirely grey and I couldn't make out any facial features...I remembering my mouth dropping open in shock trying to point...I was trying to focus, taking in more details, but it was like trying to see  something in the pitch dark, where your eyes cant quite make out what your seeing no matter how hard you concentrate. As I moved my hand to point, because at this time my friends were turning around to see what caught my attention, she disappeared. My friends kind of just laughed it off when I tried to explain what I just saw.
  The final thing that I experienced is something that, to this day, has convinced me there are things  in this world we don't understand. I was in my room, and had just finished watching a movie, it was probably around 1:30 in the morning...As I got up off my couch to turn off the the tv when I, once again, got incredibly cold and the hair stood up on my arms and neck. As I clicked the remote and the tv shut off, a ball of light zoomed down and to the right behind my head/shoulders, then cut back to the left across my lower back into the wall. I saw this because it reflected off the black tv screen. Then I got the feeling that something was watching me from the corner of the room farthest from me. I remember slowing sitting back down on my couch, curling up in the fetal position and eventually passing out from exhaustion... 
  All of these experiences had two things in common. First, the hair on my arms and neck stood up. Second, every time something happened I felt an overwhelming sense of sorrow and tears would come to my eyes. One odd thing, after we moved out one of the six people that moved in after us approached one of my roommates and asked if it was haunted- describing how her cat, upon moving in, would get inches away from the wall in her room(her room was on the 3rd floor near the creepy bathroom with attic access) and start meowing for hours on end in a very weird tone/pitch, just staring at the wall.
  I suppose why I posted this was to see if anyone could help me find out if anything had ever happened at this house. That and, in the off chance someone else who happened to live there sees this, possibly experienced similar things.

Recently, this summer, I saw the same ghost, 3 times, but that's another story for another time.

When I was 17 years old, I snapped a picture of my family's miniature schnauzer, Kramer, just days after he died. I tell a lot of people this story, and no one seems to really believe me until I show them the picture.

A few days after Kramer died, we still had his dog bed basket and toys out in the kitchen. He used to sit in his basket, and just watch the kitchen. Back facing outside, him looking around since he could see the kitchen, living room, front door, etc. all from this spot. Anyways, I was standing in the kitchen and for whatever reason, I felt inclined to snap a photo using my Sony Ericsson s710a which was my cell phone at the time. I just looked up, snapped the photo, and went on my way. Didn't think anything of it.

A few weeks later, I was uploading my pictures to my computer and I looked at the picture in the kitchen of Kramer's bed and saw his figure, sitting in his basket. To me, and I understand it's all about interpretation,  I can see him sitting in the corner of the basket, his nose making a darker spot facing forward. Using his nose as your guide point, you can make out his head and body. I've debated what position he is actually laying in but either way, to me, the head is clearly there.

Again, not sure why I took the picture at that moment - I didn't hear anything, or sense anything beyond the urge to take that photo. Everyone I show it to that knew Kramer can clearly see the same thing I do. Also, I've showed this picture to people without the red box and said, what do you see, and I've had 100% success rate of people saying there is a ghost or a shadow in the dog bed.

Here's your photos, 2 different res photos of it (after emailing, saving, sending, for years I am loosing quality because I haven't been good at tracking down the original) and a photo of me and the dog from when I was 14.

I believe firmly in fact, not faith. So, when I had a really weird experience that I think was an encounter with a ghost, it all changed. a bit **TL;DR** but it's a story, goddamnit.

I was 16, hanging out with some friends (a girl and 2 dudes). Not too far from my house was an ""[old abandoned tuberculosis hospital](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Dale_Hospital)"". We got our moxie up and went to check it out. 

We parked across the street of this sprawling, huge area of land that the hospital sits on. It's surrounded by rolling green fields with trees lining odd ways and peppering the front of the main building. To the Right of the building, there's a large, long field, with a water tower at the corner, and across the far right street is the parking lot of a grocery store. We walked across the street and ducked into the darkness of the field. It was cold, and a tad blustery, but not bad for November around here. We 4 walked arm in arm, across this field, past a row of trees. The wind was getting stronger, but as we got up to the building, it seemed to block most of it. We pulled back some plyboard off the front entrance and crept inside.

Once we were in, it was the quiet that freaked us out the most. Even with the wind blowing outside, it was almost humming with an eerie silence. We marveled at the way things had been left on desks and in cabinets, and took turns sitting in chairs long abandoned. At the end of the hall, we took the stairs up. They were wooden, and covered in what looked to be like drywall dust. It was mounding up on the corners with pieces of wall and glass. On the second floor, it was easier to hear the wind. The glass in the window at the end of the hall would shake when the wind blew. At this point we are finding abandoned beds and what looks like drawings on the walls. We reach another staircase and go up again. The third floor, seeming rather identical to the second, was skipped, so we went up to the fourth, and top, floor.

The staircase was in the middleish of the main hallway, next to the nurses station. We headed to the right. About halfway down the hall there were 2-3 very wide, heavy, swinging doors that were at the end of an enclave about 4 feet deep. Each doorway had one door, about 2 feet wide, on hinges to the right, and a small square window at head level. I pushed the door to go in, but it was locked. I peered through the doors window and saw nothing but a large, empty black room with a window directly across from the door on the wall. I could see the field outside. We all stood in the hallway discussing where we wanted to go next. 

It was me, my girl friend and dude1 standing in the hallway facing the door, and dude2 standing in the enclave facing us. My girl friend walked away to the left, investigating something, while the two guys talked. Then, and I'll never forget this, something walked past the window in the room with the locked door. Dude1 stops talking. Dude2 in the doorway notices our faces and backs away from the door. My friend is getting further down the hall to the left, and dude2 says, ""did you guys see something?"". Just as he stops talking, the door fucking flies open INWARDS and swings crazy in and out. We all commence operation FREAK THE FUCK OUT. Dude1 grabs my hand and runs to the right, to the end of the hall. dude2 takes off down the hall for my friend to the left. I remember thinking, great, now we're split up. Dude1 is FLYING down the stairs at the end of the building, and I am barely touching the steps. We get to the second floor when we notice the dust falling from in-between steps a flight above us, puffing rhythmically like someone walking down the steps. Classic old-movie style, I lean against the wall and cover my mouth at the inexplicable horror I'm imagining. Dude1 reminds me we have to leave, so of course I am cool with that idea. We get to the first floor, and head for the door, when we hear my friend and dude2 SHRIEKING. Not ""aaahhh I'm scared hold me bro"" but ""AH! AH! AH! AH! HOLY SHIT"" as if they are seeing something freaky. I'm getting super nervous, I just want to get out of there, I'm hearing shit from all angles, and then my friend and dude2 fall out of a door somewhere and the look on their faces was just like, ""GO!! GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE NOW"". We pried the plyboard again (broke it this time) and each bolted out of there. We ran from the front entrance, past the far right wing. As I'm running, there is shit being thrown out of the windows at us (chunks of wall mostly). Dude1 is still hanging on to my wrist, drags me under a low-branched tree (didn't duck, scratched my face all up) and down a hill. It was windy.

1318209434.0,18,self.Ghosts,l6jqo,I grew up in a 100 plus year old haunted house..CREEPY!,atriley26,19,1,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/l6jqo/i_grew_up_in_a_100_plus_year_old_haunted/," I have so many stories about this house I grew up in since I was a baby. If you don't believe me..that's find by me, but I'm telling the truth here. Here are a couple of stories:
Around when I was about 12, I wasn't all that keen sleeping in my own room since I always get the creeps in that house..so one night I slept next to my mom. My dad was at work as always working a 12-hour shift. So in the middle of the night, I woke up all of sudden since I felt the hairs on my neck rise straight and stiff. I turned over and I was face to face with small boy with his knees up against his chest and holding himself tightly while staring right at me. He had on overalls and a torn white t-shirt. The creepy thing about him that he was completely covered in soot. I wanted to scream but I was too frozen to say anything..I did NOT get anymore sleep that night :(. Later on, I did a little researching of the house and to see if anybody died in that house..well lo and behold there was a massive house fire back in the 1800's a family died a mom, dad (he was a farmer), and a little boy. What is really creepy..they all have the same last name as my family and I! We are not related to them at all.  
  My mom constantly was haunted by the same farmer numerous times. One night I was at a friend's house and my dad was at work like always.. and it was just my mom and my baby brother which was about 4 at the time. She was giving my brother a bath.. he suddenly moved his head and said ""dad?"" and my mom said that she yelled ""steve is that you?"" and she left the bathroom to check..and nobody was there. Another instance of the farmer ghost his name was Eli Riley, anyways mom was sleeping on the couch one night, and she woke up in the middle of the night and saw him staring directly at her. He was so tall, bony, and really skinny as a rail. He had on overalls with no shirt. He just looked away from my mom and walked through a doorway and he turned to go upstairs..by the way that was my room
  Another creepy thing happened upstairs, where my room is. I came home from school one typical day, and I always get home first before anybody does. I was in middle school at the time, so it wasn't a big deal for me to be home by myself for a while. My dad was working since 6 am and hasn't been home yet. My mom was gone since 7ish. I was the only child at the time too. Anyways..I went to get a snack and brought it upstairs to play in my room. I had this old recliner chair in the corner of the room. I always sit in it when i eat my snack and watch or listen to music. I leaned over to the side to flip the foot rest and i felt an empty box of graham bear crackers. There wasn't any plastic inside it to hold the crackers...I was like ""hmm where did the hell did this come from?"" NOBODY in my family including myself doesn't like graham bear crackers in the first place lol. By the way I didn't see it in the morning before I left for school. The house was locked up tight as a safe too! So I asked my mom and dad about it and they said we never even buy that stuff. 
I've seen shadows lurking around in my newly remodeled room on the first floor. An interesting finding, while tearing out the floors/walls in the room upstairs..we found little toys for a boy to play with. And I assume it was that little boy's toys who died in the fire :(. 
Here is the most creepiest thing about the house ever: my parents told me this like a year after we finally moved out of the haunted house. They told that my room on the first floor was a funeral showing room! The house used to be a funeral home..ugh. I know they were telling the truth because my dad reminded me that when we were remodeling the room, we found an old screen door on the right side of the room and another screen door on the left side of the room. It was set up for people to walk in and see the casket and then walk out. That's how they ran things in older style funeral homes back then.

We built the site, he thought he was legit - had several buyers from around the world. 

Weird thing is - he told us he'd been previously employed by UK intelligence, been involved with remote viewing projects, murder findings, and told us that he was being constantly monitored - we used to phone him up and get all these weird sounds on his line too. He brought in lots of photos for us to scan of orbs, that looked like blobs on the lens.

 It happened A few years ago when me and my bro would stay up all night and just play xbox, snack and just hang out. On this particular night though we decided to go to sleep early, and were in bed by 12 at the latest. Now you say what happened weird? Well in my house the game room is big, and has a wodden floor, which makes alot of noise. We had a push firetruck that  a little kid could sit in and push himself around in. So the next morning my dad complains about us pushing it around and 2-3 in the morning but as you already know we were already asleep so that really creeped us out.

After that nothing happened again for about a year until one night i was up playing alone and heard  someone coming down the stairs , now from the room you can't see them, so i though my bro was just getting food now after not seeing anyone come down, the room started getting eerily cold so I decided to get a blanket from up stairs bedroom so running up the stairs into my room my brother was totally passed out and there was no way that he was messing with me so figuring this out  I ran down the stairs turned off the xbox and haven't slept down there since then because there is no way i imagined my ""brothers"" heavy foot steps and it was too cold for an non air-conditioned room in July.

In retrospect the possible ghost or spirit isn't very invasive, only once in a blue moon does it do anything really different than walking around, or making noises like how almost every night you can hear foot steps on the back deck but there never malicious just pacing and wandering. I have yet to hear a voice but i'm trying to record something to prove its more than an active imagination, or woodland animals walking oddly.

1336104388.0,15,self.Ghosts,t6c57,Lived in haunted house in NZ for a few years,waikakaboy,19,4,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/t6c57/lived_in_haunted_house_in_nz_for_a_few_years/,"What follows is a true story, as best as I can recollect after all these years, of the most formative event of my childhood. 

I was born in 1986 and lived in Waikaka, New Zealand (though I was born in the neighboring town of Gore, as Waikaka did not have a hospital). I have an older brother and sister who are 4 and 5 years older than me respectively. My mother was a stay-at-home Mum, and my Dad was a sheep-farmer. The house we lived in was situated on a sheep farm in the tiny rural town of Waikaka in southern New Zealand. The house was actually built by my Dad's father.

The hauntings started when I was approx. 6-7 years old. I am actually unsure exactly how old I was when the haunting started. I know for a fact that we moved off of the farm a week or two after I turned 9 years old.

The first night it happened: My Dad was at the local pub. My Mum, myself, and siblings (brother and sister) were sitting in the lounge watching Married with Children. Somehow, my mother got into an argument with my siblings. I can’t remember the exact impetus for this argument, but nevertheless, my Mum sent my siblings off to bed. Eventually we went to bed too. I shared a room with my brother, our parents room was adjacent to it, and my sister had her own room at the end of the hallway from our rooms. I’m not sure how much time passed from the time my Mum and I went to bed, but at same point, my sister came running down the hallway, ran into our Mum’s room, screaming about some voice at the end of her bed breathing. Things get a little bit fuzzy in my memory here. I was half asleep when this happened, so I don’t think I had heard anything myself immediately (my brother was fast asleep). Our Mum, though, had heard this breathing in her room as well.  I haven’t the foggiest idea of how long it lasted. 

Our Mum rung up the pub that my Dad was still at and told him to get his butt home. He came home and upon hearing out story, thought there was a burglar in the house. I remember he went from room to room holding a golf club, checking to see if there was anyone in the house. By the time he had gotten home, the breathing had stopped. At some point, he rung up the neighbors (who live approx. 1-2 km away from us), and asked them if they had spotted any prowlers on their property that night (he thought it was an actual person, not something spooky). After that, for some reason, my parents thought it would be a good idea to bring the dog inside. I remember they called the dog (JR was his name), and he came to the threshold of the door, but would not come into the house. JR was visibly shaking and had his tail down between his legs. Eventually, my Dad just picked him up and brought him into the house. Not sure what else happened that night. I think we just eventually went back to bed and went to sleep with an uneventful rest of the night.

Every month or two, something similar would happen. There would be deep heavy breathing in some part of the house, usually at night, and it would scare the jeepers out of us all. For some reason, it took quite a while (as in months) until our Dad actually experienced it for himself. He was invariably either (a) working on the farm if it was during the day, or (b) at the local pub if it was night.

Most of my memories of these experiences have faded dramatically over the years. One which I remember quite well is as follows. My Mum was out that night at some sort of church thing (she may have actually been seeking advice that particular night on how to deal with whatever it was in our house). I was alone in my bedroom reading a large book, which I am pretty sure was on King Arthur (I was a huge reader when I was young, and still am). My Dad and siblings were in the lounge (at the near opposite end of the house) watching an All Blacks rugby game (rugby is NZ’s version of American Football, and the All Blacks are out national team). I was in my bed, derping around reading my book, when I hear the deep heavy breathing we had become accustomed to emanating from a corner of my bedroom. It happened once. I froze up terrified. I thought to myself that if I just ignore it, it will go away. No such luck. It breathed again. At this point, I jumped out of bed, ran down the hallway , through the kitchen, to the lounge and told my Dad and siblings. My Dad had been drinking and just yelled at me to get my butt back to bed (I am pretty sure at this point he still hadn’t experienced it for himself and so didn’t really believe us that there was something spooky in the house). I could tell from the looks on my siblings faces that they believed me, but they were too scared to say or do anything. Not wanting to step foot through the hallway, I just hid in the kitchen under the table until my  Mum came home. When she did, and I told her what happened, she ripped my Dad a new a-hole for telling me to go back to bed.

While living on the farm, I myself only experienced the deep heavy breathing of the entity, though my Mum experienced other things. I never found this out until a couple or so years after we moved off of the farm, but during the day, on multiple occasions, my Mum felt cold breezes swirl around her while she would be in the house. These naturally freaked her out and she would just go wait outside until Dad would come in from farming or we would come home from school.

On at least one occasion she heard a distinct voice. My Mum, myself, and my siblings were in the lounge one afternoon when the phone rang. My Mum answered it and took it through to the hallway to speak. Five minutes or so later, she came back through to the lounge, yelling at us, demanding to know who it was who snuck up behind her in the hallway and started whispering “mummy” to her. None of us had left the room for the entire duration of the call. And she was adamant she heard a child whispering behind her while on the phone. 

Anyway, as I said earlier, all of my experiences as far as I can remember, were just the deep heavy breathing kind, so I won’t bother to go into detail on each occurrence that I remember. Though, I will say, that I detected a pattern as to when these manifestations would occur. It seemed to always be after an explosive argument, typically involving my Mum. One humorous incident I remember is that one night my sister came and slept with me in my bed as she was too scared to sleep in her own room. I woke up in the middle of the night sometime and really really had to pee, but was too scared to even think about going to the toilet (which was halfway down the hallway). So I did what anyone would do in such a situation… I pee’d my bed with my sister in it. She understood in the morning when she woke up and I told her what happened.

Eventually, my Dad found another job (paying minimum wage, but in that situation, who gives a crap). We sold the farm and moved to the neighboring town of Gore in June 1995. Thankfully, whatever that thing was, it did not follow us (I think).

Once we moved off of the farm, no one ever talked about it. I am now 25 years old, and I swear I have not once heard my Dad say a peep about what went on out there. I did talk about it a few times with my Mum in the few years immediately after we moved off of the farm. She told me a few interesting stories. The most intriguing was that a month or so before all these haunting started to occur, she said she awoke in the middle of the night and saw an angelic figure at the side of her bed. It touched her and said something like, “Don’t worry, everything will be alright.” At the time she had no idea what it meant, but she now believes (as I do) that it was there to reassure her that no harm would come to us in what was about to occur with the evil entity.

Earlier this year I went to NZ with my wife. I went out with my mum one afternoon and we talked for a long time about all of this stuff. She told me a couple of other things that happened to her that I had never heard before. One night she heard the breathing creep up alongside her bed. Her arm was dangling out on the side of the bed, and all of a sudden she felt a tugging on her arm. She said that to this day, she never, ever, sleeps with her arms or legs dangling off the bed. On another occasion, she said she had an ominous feeling about my sister. So that night, she had my sister sleep in her room, while she slept in my Sister’s room. During the night, my Mum woke up to something strangling her. She prayed in her head and eventually the choking stopped.  She thinks that if my sister had of been sleeping in her own bed that night, that it would of happened to her instead. 

It is hard to do justice to how terrifying these experiences were, and how malevolent the ghost/demon/entity felt. Living in that haunted house was the most formative event of my life. It has had more of an impact on who I am than anything else. I think about it all the time. It is the reason I have been interested in the supernatural and religion for the past 15 years. And is the reason why I am now studying theology and religion in an academic setting.

Feel free to ask any questions but I won’t be able to answer them for a while as I’m going to bed now. Also, I remember posting an account of this on an online forum in about 2005, so I will try and find it tomorrow and see if there is anything interesting in that account that I left out here.

TL;DR – Lived in a haunted house during the age of 6-9. Whole family experienced an evil entity on many occasions. I only remember experiencing regular occurrences of deep heavy breathing. Mum experienced the worst of it. Deeply affected my entire life and still think about it almost every day (I am now 25).

1325112895.0,16,self.Ghosts,nu5fi,My friends and I no longer talk about this subject since my sighting.,Shamyrock,17,1,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/nu5fi/my_friends_and_i_no_longer_talk_about_this/," Two years ago I had my first and only ghost sighting while camping with my friends. We got freaked out and now never talk about, we avoid the subject if it comes up. Recently I got fed up with that and talked to a friend who wasn't there at the time. She confessed that her house had also been haunted with her whole family (all of which are perfectly sane normal people) having seen the ghostly activity. This is inspired me to spread the word of my experience here to finally be open about it and get rid of the fear that's been so much of a hassle. So here it goes I guess.

 I think it was during summer, my friend lives in the country and his house is rather secluded. He invited a few of the lads up to go camping in one of the fields near his house. We had done this a couple of times and we went to the usual spot near a hay stack so we wouldn't be hit by the wind. Usually there would be a good few of us just laughing and joking around, being generally quite loud so we didn't really notice what was going on around us. We were 16-17 and the only drug we used at the time was coffee. This time however there was at most 7 of us so we were quieter so spent most of the time chatting. We live in Ireland so the weather is generally unpredictable, it was quite a cold night so most of the lads were sitting in the tent. Me and my friend however were sitting on top of the hay stack over looking the tent chatting quietly. Suddenly one of the lads in the tent started yelling at us ""Stop sneaking around outside! I can hear you!"". We yelled down a few times saying that we were nowhere near. My friend eventually got down to show him exactly where we were before returning to the top. A few minutes later the same guy started yelling saying that he could hear us again sneaking around and see our shadow on the tent. We were really confused at this stage and just ignored it really, occasionally replying with usual "" we are nowhere near"". Later we went down to join them in the tent. It was already quite full at this stage but it was a big one. We sat in a kind of entrance hall thing were normally I just put my shoes. The outside door was broken so was open. After a bit of chatting I saw something in the corner of my eye, what I saw was a kind of blue aura surrounding a figure wearing what looked like tanned trousers, they reminded me of the old potato sacks. I was taken aback but figured I just imagined it. We continued talking but then I sensed movement beside me and heard a whisper that sounded like my surname with some other stuff I couldn't really hear properly and jumped up out of the tent immediately to see who was trying to freak me out but saw nothing. I then told people what I saw but they looked at me as if I was trying to play a bad joke. Since my friends didn't believe it I figured I must have imagined it but was still kinda iffy. I saw the same thing again a few minutes later, hearing my name again and dived in for the back of the tent yelling that something was there between a crap load of swearing. Not trying to tute my own horn but I don't scare easily but my friends saw that I was scared, they said I looked pale. They also knew I didn't believe in ghosts, I was constantly making fun of my friend because he did. They finally believed me and the fact that I was scared freaked them out. Even the ones that didn't believe me shifted away from the door after peaking out. I can honestly say I have never been as scared as I was  at that point though I'm home alone at he moment while I'm writing this so probably won't sleep tonight...I'll answer any questions and welcome any other possible explanations.",,False,self,t5_2r1q4,True,,,True,t3_nu5fi,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/nu5fi/my_friends_and_i_no_longer_talk_about_this/,

Their house is somewhat old (built in 50's or 60's) and has an odd history.   The man that lived in it before them built the house and lived there with his wife until my boyfriends family moved in in 1997.  Apparently this man's wife died of a heart attack but he didn't call the police or ambulance until three days after she died, fishy right?!!  When my boyfriends family moved in they found a huge painted portrait of the man in the garage with MURDERER written on it in red spray paint! Creepy. Now for my portion of the story.

It was night time and I was having trouble getting to sleep though my boyfriend was passed out next to me.  I am laying staring at the ceiling when I hear footsteps outside my door (they have creaky wood floors).  At first I thought it was his older brother who lived across the hall from us, but he is 6'4"" and you can tell when he walks on that floor because it is quite loud! These were small footsteps, and I didn't hear his door open.  A second later the footsteps end and I hear the bathroom light click on, the light shines in under my door as I am adjacent to the bathroom.  I strain my ears to see if I can hear anything in the bathroom, no movement in there, no sound of running water or someone using the toilet.  The light turns off (it is a switch on the wall that is rather hard to click on and off) and so I wait to hear the footsteps leave the bathroom...I hear nothing. At this point I am petrified and in a cold sweat...nothing more happened that night.

A week or so later my boyfriend and I get in some sort of argument and I can't sleep again.  So I leave our bedroom in the middle of the night and go to the living room on the other side of the house to watch some TV.  I lay on the ground in front of the TV and watch a couple episodes of a show on netflix and now it is just after 3:00am. I feel a strange sensation and then I hear someone sit down in the big reclining chair about 5 feet behind me, the chair creaks and I hear someone settle in it. I was frozen in place not knowing what to do. If I tried to leave the room I would have to pass that chair and I wasn't ready for that!  So I wait for another hour, watching TV with whatever was sitting in that chair. Finally I was brave enough to RUN back to our bedroom and try to sleep.

This last experience in the house was actually by my boyfriends dad from when they first moved in.  All of the bedrooms are located down a hallway which ends into the master bedroom. At the front of this hallway used to be a door (that has since been removed).  In the early mornings when he would get up he would be doing things in the kitchen like making breakfast and whatnot and would hear someone walking very fast in heels down that hallway towards the door and then abruptly stop. The first few times it happened he thought it was his wife, but she had already left for work hours before! Could we be experiencing the spirit of the original house owners wife whose death is surrounded by an odd sequence of events?? 

NOTE: I am about 4 weeks away from moving back into that house for a few months...I wonder if I should try and make any contact or just leave the spirits be?

When I was younger, I woke up early on a Sunday morning to use the bathroom.   I still remember the day and time, it was 0642am on a Sunday morning. I walked down the hallway, the recreation room to the left, the laundry room straight ahead, and the washroom to the right. 

As I passed the entrance to the rec room, I glanced in, to see, who I thought, was my brother. The lights in the room were on, he was sitting cross-legged on the floor, sorting stacks of books that towered over him, a rocking chair stood behind him. 

Immediately I wondered why he was awake so early, so I looked back into the rec room right away. The lights were off, there was no books, and no brother, the rocking chair stood in his place. 

I never saw the apparition again.

when I first moved in back in October, I was the only one living here, and I would hear someone following me up the stairs or it would get really cold in my room when I was here alone. Then when I would go to sleep, i would hear creaking down stairs or doors knocking around in the frame and at first i was sketched out, thinking that there was someone in the house, but after a while I concluded that it was someone in spirit. 

more recently, one of my roommates has told me of drum playing while he was alone in the house, and he also believes that someone is following him up the stairs. he says he has also gotten a chilling vibe as if someone was sitting in the corner of his room watching him. 

my other roommate is super religious, and refuses to believe our stories of ghost encounters, but does say that her room will get quite cold and she gets the chills as if something is touching her arm every now and then. 

My roommate that believes and i have tried to do research to find if anyone has died in the house, or had an untimely death, but we have not had very much luck with coming up with good results.
does anyone here have a suggestion as to where we might be able to find good info on an old house in the city, possibly pertaining to houses that used to be on the lot, as well as the current buildings? any help is much appreciated and i'll compensate any help with upvotes as well.

I have had a few experiences, but this one caught me completely off guard. I can't get it out of my thoughts, and I wanted another opinion.

I stayed home from work two Friday's ago to clean up our house for an insurance inspection, and the weirdest thing happened.

I've drawn you a map in paint so you can get an idea of the layout of the upstairs -&gt; http://imgur.com/EqR1B (i'm sorry about my abysmal drawing skills, the loopy things are doors, the slashes are windows, and yes, my bathroom is bigger than the bedrooms) 

Our house was built sometime between 1886 and 1903. We've been living there for almost ten years, and I've heard voices and footsteps, things get moved around, I've seen ""mist"" a few times... normal ""ghostly"" things like that, but never a full out apparition.

So I'm tidying away, washing the windows, wiping down the doors that sort of thing. I wash the window at the top of the stairs, and go to rinse my cloth out in my bucket which was sitting in the doorway of the front bedroom so I can wipe down the windowsill. I look down the hall for whatever reason and see my reflection (just a silhouette) in the frosted glass in the bathroom window. I think ""man I look like shit, I should fix my hair"" when I notice something kinda moving ""around"" my reflection. When all of a sudden BOOM a silhouette kinda bends around me at hip level (this is all in the window reflection) sticks it's arm and hand out, gives me a jazz hand wave (you could see all the fingers! It was pretty much a perfect silhouette from the waist up), and disappears.  

I just sort of stood there slack jawed, but then I realized that there was no reflection in the window period. Even what I saw as being ""myself"" wasn't there after. 

The blackness is what gets me. I have never seen something so black in my entire life. I didn't feel threatened, in fact I  laughed when I stopped being shocked by what I saw (it was really funny)

I was the only one home. Our house is 2 stories tall, and there's no physical way to be on the ""outside"" of that window. There is a tree outside, but you can't see the branches through the frosting on the window. 

I've been trying, and trying, and trying, and trying to debunk this. I've been trying different combinations of lighting at different times of day to see if i can even get a reflection of ""me"", which I have, but you can see my face, nothing that's all black like what I saw

I just, I just don't know. It seems so far fetched because it was so cartoon like. I have never experienced anything like this before. I have seen three other apparitions in my life but they always had faces or at least distinguishable features. 

It doesn't fit with what I've been reading about shadow people. This thing was intelligent, non-threatening, and it wanted me to know it was there. This wasn't out of the corner of my eye either I was looking directly at it. 

What are your thoughts? Anyone ever experienced something similar?

I tend to take any personal ghost story I read online with a grain of salt, so I totally understand skepticism.  However, I ask you to take my word that this event happened just as I will describe.  

It must have been about three years ago.  My ex-girlfriend and I were riding in my car back to my place at around 2am.  The house is in a rural area in the panhandle of Florida.  The road we were on comes to a Y at which we can continue straight or veer to the left to go towards my house.  Immediately after taking the left, we start a short incline that takes about 5 seconds before leveling out.  Soon after reaching the top of this small climb, I notice something to the left of the road.  In the first split-second, I think I must be seeing a panther.  After all, there are panthers in this area of Florida, and although rare, sightings do occur.  However, as my eyes adjust to this object I notice that it is not a panther at all.  The length, height and color of this object made me think of a panther.  It is about 5 feet long, 3 feet tall, and black.  I then think that it must be a cloud of smoke from an unseen fire in the woods to the left of the road.  I soon dismiss that idea when I realize it is moving across the road from left to right, not leaving anything behind and moving too quickly for wind to be carrying it.  It is, like I said, 5 feet long and 3 feet tall, black, and smokey in composition.  In the center of the cloud it is completely opaque, you cannot see through.  The edges of the cloud possess some translucence and appear to be wispy writhing tentacles of smoke all around.  It moves about as fast as a sprinter as it crosses in front of us from left to right before dissipating on the right side of the road in a ditch in front of a house.  The whole sighting took maybe 3 or 4 seconds.  Needless to say we were both shocked, and we rode in silence for about 10 seconds before I asked her if she had seen it.  She acknowledged that she had but when I tried to start speculating she said she didn't want to talk about it.  I think only once more in our relationship did I ask her about it and she remained unwilling to address it.  It moved with speed, did not break up until completely disappearing at the end of its movement, and was too dark and thick in the center to be smoke from a fire.  

Whats more, the direction it was coming from was a wooded area to the left of the road.  About 10 feet more down the road from where we saw it is a perpendicular street that takes you down behind where it came from into a cemetery.  It is called Crain cemetery and there used to be a church on the grounds that I was told had burned down a couple decades ago.  I rode back there a few days later on a foggy morning just to scope it out.  

I have not told anyone but a few friends about this and felt like sharing it.  If you have any questions or speculations, I'd love to hear them.  ",,False,self,t5_2r1q4,1354553072.0,,,True,t3_144wi4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/144wi4/on_the_road/,
1354305991.0,14,self.Ghosts,142fv7,A Ghost tested and approved,SaxonWitch,20,6,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/142fv7/a_ghost_tested_and_approved/,"This happened in 1981, I was 14 then . My class had gone on a week outing in Gartow am See [Germany]. We stayed in a cottage that was converted for school classes. There were rooms from 2 people to 5 people to stay in. My best friend and I stayed in a 2 bed room, right next to a 5 bedroom. Being 14, we were up to no good and even drank alcohol [even though we were not allowed, but hey!].
We did this every day. On Wednesday however I had overdone it. I had a headache and went to bed early [about 21:00h]. Once in bed, I wet a flannel, which I laid over my forehead and just lay down in bed. The room was narrow with two beds on either side of the slanty roof. In the ioddle was a window, where the Moon shone its light and illuminated most of the room. I was in the bed on the right side. In front of me were the door and on the left was a basin.
As I was lying there, I ""saw"" a figure appear. Sort of similar to the ""Predator£ in the movie of the same name. I could see it but it wasn;t there. Hard to explain. 
However, it got more and more clear. I could see an old woman in a long dress, seemingly taking clothes out of a basket and putting ot somewhere else.
This was strange enough, but she seemed to be doing this half into the wall where the basin was.
I was interested. Even as a young person, I loved ghosts and science. So I tried to test what I was seeing. I decided that I would switch on the bedside light. I thought that if I did that and switched it off again, there would be two possible outcomes. One, the apparition would be gone [evidence of headache induced imagery] or the ghost would still be there [proof of actual ghost?- hey, I was only 14].
So I switched the light  on and obviously everything was gone, Then I switched it off again [keeping my eyes closed, so I would be used to the dark - I was quite good at science already ;)].
So after a few minutes with my eyes closed and light switched off, I opened my eyes...and the old woman was still there...only she had stopped her ""work"". 
She was standing there looking in my direction.
I wasn't scared at all at this point. She seemed ""nice"".
However, I could see all the details. Her dark long dress, the white apron, the grey bun.
After a while staring at each other, she walked towards me.
I still wasn't scared.
However when she reached the bed and literally stood next to my head, she bent down really quickly, with stary eyes!!!!!!!!

What did I do?
I screamed and turned round, making sure that the duvet was covering all my feet and arms and thought: ""I am not going to turn round until my room mate is coming back"".

Fast forward next morning. We were having breakfast and obviously we were sitting within our peer group. When most of us were gone, I overheard a girl that I normally wouldn't have considered a friend talking about a ""ghost"" in her room.
I took the opportunity and took a seat next to her to ask her more questions. 
Now she was in the 5 bedroom right next to ours, where the basin was.
I did not tell her anything but asked what she had seen, And she told me that at about an old lady in a black dress and a grey hair bun.
I did ask her if she was ""working""?
But the girl said that the woman was just standing there. Looking at her.
Now remember that I had not told anyone about this. 

Basically, she must have seen her first. I saw this woman shortly after 21:00. 
We were gobsmacked, to say the least. 
Together we went to the landlady and asked her if there was anything in the history of this old cottage that could pinpoint to an old lady.
But we were fobbed off, sort of like a nuisance. She basically told us to eff off, as she had work to do.

This is all we could find out...I.e nothing.
The landlady and her husband had only ran tho
iis place for a short while and now that I am ""older"" than they were at the time, I see how we must have looked.

I did several searches on Google about the place, have tried to find my school friend but no avail.
However to me it is a sighting with an independent witness and therefore quite unique.
I am someone who always looks for an alternative answer first [especially: ""you were drinking"" but in this case, I have no explanation but that WE saw a ghost. Considering that I didn't ""drink"" on this day [I only had a headache] and that the other girl went to bed early as well and was the only one in the 5 bed room.
If anyone want's more info I am happy to give more details as far as I can. 


Edit 2: I completely forgot the most important bit of the whole story [duh], so here it goes: 
When I sat up in bed, after I switched the light back off and the old lady was still there, I did something very clever [I think anyway ;)].
I swore to myself, literally with hand on heart that what I was seeing was what I was seeing. I said it in a whisper and described what I was seeing to myself in detail [i.e I see an old woman right now and the lot]. I did this so that when the memory would wane the next day or later in life I would still have this action to remind me that it was exactly as I described. I have to say that without having done this, my mind would have probably diluted the whole thing and changed details to fit with a more 'sane' explanation. So pad on the back to my 14 yr old self for that!

The landlord to the place was super anal about making sure they did no remodeling or repairs...he wanted NOTHING changed.  It was odd to say the least. 
After a while my mom and her BF started saying they think the place was haunted by the ghost of a small girl. They said sometimes they would see the shadow of a girl walk from room to room. Or hear playing in the back when nobody was back there.  And sometimes it sounded like a small child was sobbing but couldn't tell where from.
 
Me being an atheist at the time, I kinda blew it off. I was like ""yeah...right...haha""
 
So anyway. This was towards the end of me and Ex's relationship. When we split up, I started living with my mom until I got on my feet.  We shared custody of our daughter, Alexis, 50/50.  So one week she'd stay with me until Friday, and then she'd go to my Ex's until the following Friday, and then she'd come back with me.  She was about 2 going on 3 at the time.
Anyway, It was Saturday night and I was on the computer. It's probably like 2 in the morning. I'm just surfing music.  The computer desk was in the kitchen facing a wall and on that wall was the doorway that led to the bedrooms, so if anyone came out of bed to get something from the kitchen then they would walk right passed me.
Alexis was always getting up in the night and getting into trouble. She'd raid the fridge or knock something over while climbing up on something. She like to get up in the night and raid the kitchen because she knew everyone was asleep and she could get away with it.  This particular night I happened to be up at 2 am on the computer.  I see Alexis sneak into the kitchen with my peripheral vision and she froze when she saw me. And just stood there.  I didn't look at her or pay her attention. I figured she had seen me...she knows she's caught....hopefully she will go back to bed and go to sleep without me having to make a big deal of it.  So she stands there for about 3 minutes, and I can see her the whole time but I make a point not to look at her so she will just go back to bed. She eventually turns and walks back towards the bedroom.  It was dark in the room...but I could still see her turn and leave.
 
Everything was dead silent after that.  So after about 15 minutes, I got that feeling in my gut that I need to check on her because she's probably up to no good...in 15 minutes I should have heard her climb back in bed or rustle through toys.  Hearing absolutely nothing normally meant she was trying to be quiet for a reason. Every parent gets that sick feeling in their stomach when their kid is up to no good, and I got that feeling so I got up to check on her.
 
I stood up and walked into the next room that led to the bedrooms. And it was pitch black...couldn't see a thing.  And that's when it hit me...

1371831599.0,11,self.Ghosts,1gsvce,My Childhood Home,molly_katharine,15,4,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/1gsvce/my_childhood_home/,"As a lover of hearing ghost/paranormal/unexplained stories (although, at the risk of sounding pretentious, an open-minded skeptic), I've been reading this page off and on for a while now and it gave me the motivation to share my own - only - unexplained and potentially paranormal experience.

From the time I was born until I was 16, I lived in a 1960's ranch house in suburban Missouri. For the last three or four years that I lived there, I had developed a pretty much perpetual feeling of unease whenever I was at home, especially alone and especially at night. The development of this feeling I had about the house coincided with my family life having completely crumbled when I was about 12 - my parents were going through a very bitter divorce and my older brother moved out, leaving me alone in the house with my mom, who at the time was struggling with extremely destructive alcoholism, manic depression, and (IMO) more extreme psychological issues. As you can imagine, since I was an adolescent at the time, I also began to struggle with feelings of depression, anger, etc. - typical emotions kids go through when things like that happen. Frankly, my relationship with my mom was terrible and set the tone for our home life from then on.

In any which case, the atmosphere in the house gradually changed from something of comfort to something unpleasant and, right before we moved out, severely unwelcoming. My friends didn't like to visit anymore and preferred their own homes instead for our sleepovers, etc.; they told me my house was creepy and ""felt weird"" even though my house had previously been our main headquarters. Large enough, lots of games to play, acreage, etc. etc. I know my mom being in the state that she was didn't help my preteen social life, but I felt the house's descent of creepiness too.

Quick sidenote: if you'd like to envision the layout of our house, it was a closed floor-plan shaped not unlike a mallet. A very long hardwood hallway connected a string of bedrooms to the kitchen, living room, and dining room. My bedroom branched off the middle of the hallway. The basement isn't especially relevant to this story, apart from the fact that it made me the most uneasy of all and I avoided it at all costs once my brother moved out of it.

Anyway, like I said, my childhood home started giving me the willies pretty much all the time. The pinnacle of these willies was the sound of footsteps that started pattering up and down my hallway late at night. My dog (our only pet) would be in bed with me and my mom would be wiped out in bed, so there was no explanation for them - but they happened. I can recall several different times that I just heard footsteps going up and down the hallway. Very soft footsteps. It was terrifying, and being a 22-year-old now, I still feel the need to sometimes sleep with lights or the television on.

The footsteps went on without change and I dealt with it without telling anyone. However, one afternoon shortly before we moved out of the house for good, I was sitting in our spare room at the very end of the hallway on my computer after school. This was a normal routine for me at this point, considering my mom was a teacher in a district a ways away and wouldn't get home until an hour after me. It was a fall day and no windows were open, no air conditioner running, nothing - just myself and silence. All of a sudden, our kitchen pantry door slammed shut with so much force that a rack of items hanging on the back of it (including a pair of scissors, which I have no clue why we thought was a good idea) fell to the ground. It made such an awful crash that I screamed and bolted out of my seat.

After the briefest of investigations, I snatched my cell phone up and literally sat outside in my yard until my mom came home. After I told her what happened, she seemed a little ill at ease that I was so shaken up, but nothing real came of it.

Needless to say, I was more than ready to leave when we moved out of the house - my mom cited that it ""held too many memories."" It also needed more repairs than we could afford. Regardless, I haven't been back since and dislike even thinking about the house, though I heard it was purchased and renovated.

To this day, when I share this story with friends, I don't say it was a ghost that did it - it's just unexplained. I consider mysef to be level-headed, but there's no rationality I can come up with to reason with the footsteps or the door slamming with that much force. Sometimes I do wonder if it's a possibility the awful dissolution of my family life and all the severe negativity that came with it for several years attracted a bad sort of energy - maybe not a poltergeist, but an otherworldly type of sufferer who fed off our sad household.

Oh well - it makes for a decent story, I guess. I wonder if anyone else has ever experienced a strange influx or change in ""energy"" in their home?

My little sister woke me up crying because she needed a glass of water. She got some water and I couldn't get back to sleep. I noticed that it looked unusually bright outside from what I could see out my window. I decided it would be relaxing to go look out my window and see how peaceful everything was. I was looking to the North, as my room looks out over the roof of our garage, and I noticed out of the corner of my eye that there was two glowing red dots floating above the garage. I turn my head and stare at them for a minute before I realized, to my horror, that they were eyes. I could see now that there was a long, bony, pale face looking at me. The eyes seemed to be too big for the face though. The figure I saw was wearing a long hooded cloak, and I saw that it was holding what appeared to be a shepherd's crook up against my window. I thought I was dreaming so I looked away and blinked a few times. When I looked back, the figure seemed to be closer. I ran to my parent's room, woke up my dad and told him there was something outside my window, so he went in there and we both looked out the window and it was gone. 

I've seen something similar 4 or 5 times since then. The most recent occurence being last Thursday evening. I haven't seen the face since then, but I have seen this floating black mass that appears to be 6 feet tall or so, and has the same glowing red eyes.

I was awaken to someone caressing my hair like it was moving it away from my face, I didn't care at first because I was so tired and didn't rationalize the situation yet. Then I felt someone kiss my lips, I still remember because I felt moist lips which was a little chapped kiss me gently while it put his hand behind my back to an arch. Only then did I realize that something was off. I was too scared to open my eyes because I didn't want it to know I was awake, I taught it was a real person who broke in. When I suddenly had the courage to open my eyes it was a blueish clear figure on top of me. It was broad daylight. I couldn't and didn't want to look at him in the eyes, he just disappeared after ten seconds.

The motorcyclist had unfortunately ended up crashing and died from his injuries. His girlfriend was also at the party and several days after the incident his girlfriend reviewed the video from the night of the crash. She noticed something strange on the video. 

There appears to be a figure of a head near the door which you can see at least a few times. His girlfriend claims that it appears to be her deceased boyfriend's face but the video isn't all that clear so I think it would be hard to tell. Either way it's freaky.

Here is the story that stood out to me...

-Post from SC_Lawman-
Myself and a buddy on my squad responded to an alarm. The incident location was an old office type building that had been converted to doctor's offices. There was a pharmacy attached to it. Our dispatch received a motion signal from an upstairs office. Key holder arrives on scene and we go in to secure the building. The stairs were locked behind a door that, of course, the key holder didn't have keys too, so we took the elevator up to the second floor (not the most tactically sourd option, I know).

Elevator opens to a pitch black hallway... except for one overhead light at the end of the hall. We start checking doors, and so far all are secured. We get to the last office, and sure enough, the door is unlocked. We make entry and observe it to be an unused office. The door opend to a sizable waiting room and reception area. There were about 10 or 12 exam rooms, all cleared with no hiccups.

We exit the office and immediately, something seems off. That is when I realize the overhead light at our end of the hallway that had been on was now off, replaced by another light over by the elevators. I look at my squad mate and he is completely white. I ask him what is wrong and he says, ""Weren't all those doors we just checked closed and locked."" I tell him yay, so. Buddy says, ""Well now they're all standing open."" Sure enough, all the offices down the hallway we had just checked were now standing open. Pucker factor sinks in at this point. 

So we start clearing offices and securing offices. We finish the last office, and on our way out, just before we turn the corner to get into the waiting area, the main door just slams shut. Then, our radios start going nuts with some kind of static feedback. Now I just want to get the hell out of there. 

We get back in the elevator and head down to the first floor to make contact with the key holder again. However, key holder is no where to be found. I contact dispatch and request a call back number for the key holder so I can advise him of what we found. Dispatch states that the key holder was still enroute to us and was advising an eta of 5 minutes. I advise dispatch that we had already been out with the key holder. Dispatch requests I give them a call.

I call dispatch and she tells me that there is no way we were out with a key holder. She states that the alarm company had only just made contact with one. Eventually, the ""real"" keyholder arrives on scene and I ask her about the man that had let us in the building (the first key holder). She asked me to describe him, so I did. She states that that sounds like one of the doctors that used to lease the office on the second floor AT THE END OF THE HALL. She then states that he had committed suicide at his summer home several days ago.

A few days after getting settled into the house, I started hearing footsteps. This was weird to me because my parents were at work and my sister and brother were exploring the neighborhood. I was in the bedroom I shared with my older brother when I heard them. I listened closely and after a minute they stopped. I dismissed it as it being the dog thumping about.

After a few weeks of living in that house and hearing footsteps, I am laying in bed on my laptop, facing the doorway. My brother is nearby at his desk. I look up from the laptop to tell him something and I see a white figure in the doorway. Peeking around from where my sister's room was. This was late, so my sister was asleep. It darts back and vanishes. The weird thing is that on the side the figure was on, there was about an inch of space between where the door frame starts and where the corner is.

Fast forward about a year. At this point I am having sleeping problems, so I stay up pretty late at night. This was around midnight. I am on  the couch in the living room with my dog (a Belgian Shepherd Malinois) laying next to me. Suddenly, there is a loud bang at the door that leads from the garage to the kitchen. Me and the dog both look over and wait. After nothing else happens, I go back to watching tv, but my guard is up. a few minutes later: BAM! The door swings open about ninety degrees, blocking the hall to it. At this point, I grab a shoe (though, I don't know why I didnt grab the iron fire poker) and sneak around to the other entrance to the kitchen and hallway to find nothing in the garage. The car entrance is closed, the entrance to the dog fence is blocked off and the door to the back yard is locked and shut tight.

Another few months later, I am laying in bed. Eventually, I fall into a light sleep where I have a dream of me sitting in a swivel chair in front of a large computer in a panic. I realize that I am dreaming and the chair flies back into the shadows behind me. All around me I hear whispers and see flickers of movement. Then a large, hulking figure with blood red eyes starts moving towards me at an alarming rate. And I wake up with sleep paralysis. I cant move, I can barely breath. and I cant scream when I see the man with the red eyes by my desk moving towards my brother. When I do sit up and yell, he vanishes.

I moved in with them to fulfill a promise that I had made with my uncle. He asked if I would like to live with my aunt if something were to happen to him. Being a child of three or four I didn’t know what death was, so I agreed. One rainy day he was tending to the berries and caught cold. He died of pneumonia that year.

Living there, I always had an uneasy feeling going to lower floor. It was my uncle’s refuge where he spent much of his free time in his recliner watching basketball games on his large Zenith TV. My aunt had the TV moved up to the living room on the upper floor sometime after I moved in.
 
A small jar of Vick's VapoRub One night my aunt and I were watching TV. My grandmother had gone to bed. I remember that the Seattle Super Sonics were playing, my late uncle’s favorite basketball team. Sometime in the middle of the game, the intense smell of Vick’s VapoRub started to come from the stair well. The smell was so strong it was as if someone brought a jar right up to my nose. (When my uncle first became ill, he used Vick’s to ease his congestion.) As the scent lingered, the hairs on the back of my neck stood on end. My aunt had noticed the scent, too, and she started to talk, ”Honey, we are doing well. You can go back and rest. Go now, go back and rest.” As soon as she finished, the scent disappeared. We went to bed shortly afterward like it was any other night; we didn’t finish watching the game.
 
We never talked about it very much. I vaguely remember my aunt telling my grandmother the next day. The incident rarely came up in conversations with friends or relatives. As a child, I didn’t quite understand what had happened. But, after having had a few similar experiences, I have a better understanding.
 
Spirits of the deceased sometimes linger for whatever reason. His last concern was that of the berry farm before he died and might have been why he remained. And, he might have remained in his favorite part of the house: the lower level. But, when his TV was moved and his favorite team was playing, he came upstairs.

Later on, after moving out of that house, I heard other reports of his presence, especially in the lower floor. After my aunt remarried, her new husband found all the lights on in the lower floor when no one had gone down. A cousin, alerted his mom that there was a customer for berries in the house, when he saw the figure of an old, bald man, come down the stairs to the lower floor. It gave his mom the chills; it fit my late uncle’s description. The same cousin, saw a man in overalls and a straw hat walk into the pump house near the pond. During Thanksgiving one year, a relative saw his image sit next to her in a large mirror.

I haven’t heard of any other sightings of him within the past few years. He might be at peace now.",,False,self,t5_2r1q4,False,,,True,t3_12opf2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/12opf2/my_first_encounter/,

Do Spirits Travel Out Of The House?,KaitKindly,19,7,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/zst7c/the_activity_this_week_shifted_to_the_barn_do/,"I have lived in my house for four and a half years now and everyone who has been here has seen, heard, or felt something in the house.  Rarely has it seemed aggressive towards anyone.

In the two years, we've noticed some creepy activity outside (flashing lights, orbs in the woods, screams) but we live on part of the Trail Of Tears, so we just chalked it up to that being the cause.

This week, however, the activity has been *very* noticable at my barn.  (Months ago, blood ran down a stall door and was on one of the horse's fly-mask but none of the horses or the barn cat had cuts and the blood was fresh.  It was the only thing that happened so I brushed it off.)

I have been hearing movement (taps, footsteps, shifting) when no one and no animals are there with me; come back to see weird drag-like marks on the floor almost every day; hear sighs, mumbling, and whispers; and the biggest thing for me -- my best horse, Skeeter, who is never scared of anything around him and has a laid-back personality, flipped shit in the middle of the night.  He ripped apart his hay net and threw it across his stall, splintered a board, dented his stall lock, tore down his water bucket, and pawed a hole into the floor.

He has *never* acted like that for anything and flew out of the barn when I went in to pick up after him and refused to come near the barn for two days, even for food.

**Can activity shift to another part of a property like this?  What should I do at the barn?  I don't want my horses to be scared in their own stalls.**

**TL;DR**  Activity in barn suddenly when there never was before.  It has begun to set off my horses, starting with my best, most experienced horse, which worries me.",,False,self,t5_2r1q4,False,,,True,t3_zst7c,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/zst7c/the_activity_this_week_shifted_to_the_barn_do/,

But I love reading all your stories, so I thought I'd share one of my own which has shaken my beliefs every time I recalled it. 

Anyway, so about 5 years ago I was working at some kind of youth hostel in germany. It was located on a hilltop, built around/in the remains of some medieval castle. The main building had 4 floors and was built into the foundation of a house that was part of the castle.
My job there was to check up on the state of the bedrooms when our guests left, mainly to verify nothing was broken. This typically happened on sundays and my story happened on a sunday. I had a coworker there, who I lived together with in another building on the premises of that hostel. He had collected the keys for the bedrooms in the main building when people left their rooms. After all the keys had been collected I started my walkthrough of the rooms, which usually were left with their door opened. Some people locked up the rooms, but as I had a master key this was no problem. 

However, on that specific day it was. On the third floor there was one room locked up. I took out my key, tried to fit it in the lock but to no avail; the key didn't fit in completely, as if there was another key in the lock from the other side. I noted that, went on with my walkthrough and later came back down to my coworker. I asked him to show me the key to the specific room and it wasn't there; which was odd as the guest had signed our key receipt list. 

I showed him the situation and we couldn't manage to open the door. We tried to open it with the old credit card trick. It didn't work, the door was *locked*. So we called the locksmith to get the door open. He arrived, drilled open the lock and sure enough, there was the key on the inside of the door. We immediately searched the room for a left behind guest but there was noone there. Absolutely nothing out of the ordinary, except a key that magically disappeared from our office and went to lock up a door on its own from the inside.

So we tried to come up with a reasonable explanation for this. We could be pretty sure that you can not lock a door from the outside with the key in the lock on the inside. We can also rule out someone jumping through the windows to accomplish this as the room was on 3rd floor; no balconies in front of the windows. It's a good 15 metres straight down there, the house had pretty tall rooms. 

Having finished this, I'd really like your opinion on this reddit. I can't think of a logical explanation even 5 years later but I don't want to rely on the (possibly existing, there's other weird stories about the building complex) local poltergeist.

tl;dr: Door locked from the inside with noone inside the room, no other entry to it either; did a poltergeist pull a trick on us?

Edit: also, the windows to that room were closed and could only be opened from the inside.

1345687563.0,12,self.Ghosts,yo8n9,My Investigation in the Pensacola Light House and Museum.,JamesLindholm,16,4,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/yo8n9/my_investigation_in_the_pensacola_light_house_and/,"Through out my life, I have lived in preternatural/paranormal environments, one after the other.  But out of all of my experiences, (Just ask, And you shall receive) the one that sticks out the most, almost landed me a job with a Paranormal Research Team in Pensacola.

I had joined The United States Navy late last year. (12DEC11 is the day I left for Basic Training)  After graduation from Basic Training, I was sent to Pensacola for the first part of my technical training.  I was there for a total of 10 weeks.  About 4 or 5 weeks in, I had met a fellow sailor (and for the sake of keeping his Identity safe, We'll call him Chuck.)  He over heard me talking with a few other sailors in the barracks' smoke pit about our past paranormal experiences.  At that moment I had already pulled up information about the Pensacola Lighthouse and Museum, and was reading the contents of the article out loud.  Chuck was jealous because he has never had a paranormal experience before.  So I agreed to take him to the lighthouse that following Saturday.

Fast Forward to Saturday night.  Chuck and I were sitting outside of the Museum, watching the lead investigating team unloading their vans of boxes, and their boxes of equipment.  I watched excitedly, like a child would watch his/her parents bring out the hidden Christmas gifts on Christmas Eve.  I found out from the Team's Equipment Technicians, that they toured with TAPS (The Atlantic Paranormal Society) on their private gigs in Florida.  So I knew we were in for an interesting night.

Upon the start of the Tour, they divided the ""Tourists"" (approx. 15 people including Chuck and I.) into three groups.  Group One went up into the tower to the Light House Keeper's Quarters.  Group Two went into the Master Bedroom.  And Group Three went down into the Basement.  The Total tour was two hours long.  The first hour was just equipment information, and expectations and stories about the rooms we were allowed to investigate.

The Basement has two spirits:  Raymond, and Thomas.  Raymond was a man who was caught by the Authorities outside of the lighthouse, tried and hung for his crimes.  He is not an aggressive spirit.  He is very remorseful.  He is terribly sorry for what he's done, and doesn't want to hurt anyone anymore.
     Thomas was a runaway slave.  The lighthouse was used as a stop along the Underground Train Route.  Unfortunately, before Thomas could get to safety, he was caught in the basement, and killed.  He is also a kind spirit.  He is also shy, and loves Blonde women.

The Master Bedroom on the Second Floor:  Three spirits haunt this room.  Miss Ellie, Little Lizzy, and Lizzy's brother, Joey.  I do not remember who passed first, but the three entities passed at two different moments in history.  Let me start with the Lady of the House.  [Victorian Era] Miss Ellie.  She fell in love with a sailor who was lost out at sea.  She was pregnant with his child, and had hemorrhaged during birth, and died shortly after.  Her daughter grew up to live a long and happy life.
    Lizzy and Joey along with their father, a Lighthouse Keeper, had passed away due to some sort of Fever in the mid to late 1800's.  The Children haunt the children's room which is adjacent to the Master Bedroom, and the Lighthouse Keeper's Quarters in the Tower. 

About 20 high in the Tower, is the Lighthouse Keeper's Quarters.  The Three spirits that haunt this room are Joey, Lizzy and their father, The Lighthouse Keeper.

At 8PM, the Investigations started.  Chuck and I headed to the Master Bedroom.   Upon arrival, I was handed an EMF Detector (A device which measures Electromagnetic Field Disturbances. Depending on the severity of the disruption it can light up from Green, to Yellow, to Red.)  The room had the Bed, a fireplace, a doorway leading to the Children's room, a door to the hallway (I was standing in front of the door leading the hallway, Chuck was to my right), and a dresser. The Investigating Medium/Psychic was standing in between the Fireplace and the bed, the Lead Investigator was on the other side of the fireplace from her.  there were five other tourists to my left, and one more investigator to Chuck's right, between the Dresser and the corner. 
     The Medium closed her eyes and said Joey was beside me, between the wooden railing, and a side table.  I had the EMF Detector, and slowly moved it around the area where she claimed the boy was.  
""There's nothing here,"" I said.  The detector was silent.  All of the sudden, it gets really cold, and I smell Lavender, a sign of Miss Ellie's presence.  All the Men in the room, including Chuck and I, were wearing hats.  I said:  ""Gentlemen, take off your hats, we are in the presence of a Lady.""  as soon as I took my cover off the EMF lit up to the red.
""She appreciates that.  Usually people come in a demand answers.""
""That is no way to treat a lady.""  As soon as I said that, the EMF went back up to the red, and my hand went cold.  All the Cameras were focused on me.  I felt a tugging at my hand, and the EMF went silent. ""Miss Ellie, Will you be so kind as to take me on a small tour of your beautiful home?""  Up to the Red.  She then began to lead around the Master Bedroom and into the Children's Room.  To make it simple, Every time I asked a Yes or No question, she would light up the EMF Detector for Yes.  And if it was No, the Detector remained silent.  When she led me back into the Master Bedroom, I said: ""Thank you ma'am.  It has been a pleasure spending time with you in your beautiful home.  Thank you for having us.""  I gently ""squeezed"" her hand, and gave her hand a kiss,( as was custom for a gentleman to do.)  and she seemed to vanish.  After that, for the rest of the night, the master bedroom was uneventful.  

I left the EMF Detector in the master bedroom, and Chuck and I headed into the basement for 20 minutes.  It was silent. but we still sat there and talked with the investigators there, told them about what happened upstairs.  

For the last portion of the Investigation, we went up into the Keeper's Quarters.  there was a total of 15 people there including Chuck and I.  We walked in on the group watching a bottle rock back and forth on the floor with 4 EMF Detectors surrounding it, all silent, until someone squawked on the Walkie Talkie.  I had noticed that the Swap-Cooler that was above one of the windows, had a current flow that went straight to the bottle.  When word got out to the rest of the tourists, the room was packed, and the bottle had stopped moving. Again, I was being filmed by total strangers, arguing with the Medium/Psychic about my theory of the Bottle's movement.  I was able to prove that with the placement of the audience in the room, they were blocking the air current, preventing the bottle from rocking.

But enough about my arguing with the fraudulent Psychic.  After that tour, the lead investigator caught Chuck and I as we were walking out the door, and asked about my side of tonight's investigation and my thoughts on the Lighthouse.
""Given the events in the Master Bedroom with Miss Ellie, I believe she is at the lighthouse.  The Basement was uneventful, so I will no draw any conclusions until further investigations.  I don't even want to talk about the mockery of investigation that happened in the Keeper's Quarters.""
""How do you think overall of the light house?""
""I think there is some activity here but not enough for me to be satisfied enough to believe there are other entities here besides Miss Ellie.""
He looked me over for a minute and said, ""If you're ever in the area, and we're doing another tour, feel free to stop by.  We could use someone like you on our team.""

Chuck had started tugging on my sleeve as the Taxi Cab pulled up, ending my our night at the Pensacola Lighthouse and Museum.

None of this was exaggerated.  Everything I have stated here actually happened.  I'm pretty sure you might find a video of me or two with an EMF Detector arguing with the Medium.  If you do, I'd love to see it.  I know this is long to read, it was eve longer to type.  Thank you for reading, I greatly appreciate it.  Happy Hunting!

TL;DR Pensacola Lighthouse, freaky shit, kind of haunted.  Argued with a Fraudulent Psychic.  Was offered an Investigation Job for the Lighthouse.

When I was three years old, my father died. Due to suicide. He was depressed and addicted to drugs. His depression was caused by his job, the army. He had seen death so many times, he couldn’t bare life anymore.
I know how he did it – he hung himself. Even though my mother doesn’t like talking about it, she told me. And it’s quite obvious, since the markes are still visible on the stairs. One of the steps is cracked, due to his weight.
Anyhow, I always loved spending time with my father, and vice versa.
I barely know what happened after he died, the only thing that I remember was his pale face and his bleu lips, and I didn’t knew why he was in this cold room.

After a few years  (I was about five years old), I had really bad dreams. The dreams started with this one;
I woke up in the middle of the night, in my fathers clothes. I’m myself, but in his sweater. I walk upstairs, half sleepdrunk. Halfway the stairs I stop. Cry. And jump. Right before I fall down, I start to float. I feel my body getting lighter, and I rise up from my body. I see my body half floating, half hanging. And in a split second I wake up. Not knowing whether I dreamed It, or it just happened.

I never told anyone about this dream though, because it wasn’t relevant, in my eyes. After a few months, and having that dream almost daily, I started to have other dreams. 
One in a pharmacy. I could see my father carrying me through the pharmacy, while he is in his army uniform. I can see him cry, as his friends and his co-workers getting shot. Blood and bodies everywhere, but he’s sticking with me.
About two years after he died, I had the most terrifying dreams. This particular dream was so intense. 
I stood by his grave. I said hi, like usual. ‘Hi daddy, how are you doing? I made you a drawing, so you have something that reminds you of me.’ And as I lay down the drawing, his face slowly comes through the glass gravestone. (It’s hard to explain what it looks like, but the front is made of glass.. Use some imagination.) Anyhow, his face gets more visible, and I see his hands, pressing against the glass. Since it’s his spirit, he raises out, and he stays low, not further than his shoulders. He looks scared, and mumbles something that I can hardly understand. I’m frightened by his apparel. And I just stand there. Looking at him. He’s ‘floating’. And then the glass breaks. In million little pieces. 

At that point I woke up, screaming in agony.  It’s the only dream that my mother knew the existence off, and it creeped her out as well. A five year old child, with dreams like these. I always calmed her down by saying; ‘no worries mommy, dad isn’t angry, he is scared. Why can’t I help him? ‘
Apart from these dreams, I used to talk to him as well. I talked for hours, and never got tired of it. I don’t even remembered how it started – I just did. And I even laughed, like he was telling me stories to. I saw these stories in picture’s. If I made it up, I don’t know. For somehow, I knew things that I wasn’t supposed to know. I asked my mother for the pictures of their wedding. I asked for a particular photo, that I’d never seen before. She pulled out the scrapbook, but the photo  wasn’t there. I knew where it was. ‘mommy, you have to look in the nightstand on dad’s side of the bed, it’s there.’ And there it was. A picture that I’d never seen before. My mom had forgotten about this picture, but somehow I knew where it was.
For several years, no weird stuff happened. Until I was burning a candle in my room.  My mom didn’t allow me, since I was very uncarefull with fire. I lighted a match, and the candle. The candle went out. I tried again. The candle burned. And the fire died. And again, and again. I knew it couldn’t be the wind, since my window was closed, and my house is isolated. It went on, and off. I could hear something, it felt like a warning. And I knew that I had to stop trying. And therefore, I couldn’t try, since it felt like my hand was getting hold by my side.

It kinda creeps me out to write it down like this, I don’t know if I’m just crazy, or if I had contact with my father..

Mini DV cameras with IR amplifiers for the night vision. IR temperature gauges. A slew of audio recorders (My personal one was a digital Olympus connected to a boundary Mic) And of course, Digital Cameras.

Anyway, we ""investigated"" An old shopping center called the Cotton Mill Square in Greensboro, a couple of cemeteries in the area. And an old Abandoned small cottage in the woods off some highway, Can't remember which one. It was all good times, saw some strange stuff and ran from the cops once.

She was in the Barn an hour ago and thought she heard something moving. She turned around to see a big/fat black and white cat (white belly, black head/back) on a shelf.  She is used to seeing stray cats as she feed them.

The cat had deep blue eyes and looked at her quietly. She didn't feel threatened or frightened but it wasn't scared of her either.  It was just looking at her calmly. It did not move. But, just as she was about to talk to it, it faded away right before her eyes. Within seconds she could see the Barn wall behind the cat. 

Mom is in shock as this is completely alien to her. She doesn't believe in ghosts or the paranormal. I do though. Mom has a heart complaint so I'm keeping her calm, She wants to know what this could mean (good and bad). Is it a bad omen? Could she see the cat again? We've not heard of a ghost cat before- it sounds ridiculous- but, for her sake, we need to find an answer. Any ideas please?

 Edit:
Mom just said she burst into tears when it disappeared. she didn't realise she was doing it until she felt her cheeks were wet. She also said that no cat could get to the shelf in the Barn. She has a headache now and is very upset.

She is telling me more info now... she said that the cat was very large and could have hurt her if it had attacked. It was definitely a cat but large and strong. One of the largest/strongest she has seen.

I'd hear a woman singing. One time a woman called my name out. I was home alone at the time. Talk about being creeped out. Objects would move or go missing and later reappear. I'd hear walking around.

One time I finally saw it. I only ever saw it once. I went to my bathroom and when I turned into the doorway there it was in front of me. It had no features. It was a white light in the shape of a human, a male shape bc of broad shoulders. It didn't disappear. I could no longer dismiss what had been happening bc it was right there in front of me. I stood there for quite a while kind of frozen. It didn't disappear. I finally backed up out of the bathroom and left. I never saw it again. 

This stuff happened over the yrs. One summer my 2 best friends came down to visit. I live in the nola area, and they're from pa. One night we were in bed talking when we heard someone walking down the hallway towards my bedroom. We got scared. I was in the middle of the bed laying on my back and they were on either side on their stomachs. It stopped outside my door. We were holding our breaths. Then I knew it was in the room. Door never opened but you could just feel a pressure in the room. Then Kim flew up saying someone tapped their fingers on her back. Right as she's saying this a pain shoots down my left arm like electricity. I flew up into a sitting position and started crying bc it hurt so much. It took a while for the feeling to go away. It turned into tingles and disappeared. The pressure in the room left. Then we heard male voices talking in the attic. I couldn't make out what they were saying but Kim said she heard my name. I don't have a real attic. You can't go up into it and walk around. You can stick your head in it and that's about it.

After that experience I researched ghosts and found you could order them to leave. At this point I was certain there was more than one. So I ordered them to leave.

The activity mostly died down. Nothing really happens but maybe once a yr. Not even. Nothing has happened in I think 3 yrs. The last thing that happened was in my room I was laying in bed reading and something hit the foot of my bed. Like someone slammed their hand down quite forcefully. I never prayed so hard in my life. 

Anyways lately I've been thinking about it. Since the anniversary of the flight that crashed in my neighborhood. I live 2 miles or so from the New Orleans airport. So I've been thinking maybe it's victims from that crash? Lots of people lost their lives that day. On the flight and who lived where it crashed. That makes sense right since there's more than one and the activity comes and goes?  It was pan am flight 759 back in 1982 if you wanted to look it up.",,False,self,t5_2r1q4,1350123034.0,,,True,t3_11eqx5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/11eqx5/haunted_neighborhood/,
1348771749.0,9,self.Ghosts,10kr21,A Couple of stories,apolloRocketoflove69,14,5,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/10kr21/a_couple_of_stories/,"Hello, Reddit just finished reading some stories posted up on here and i'd figure to share some of mine.

CHICAGO

I always believed in ghost, paranormal,witches, etc. I come from a hispanic background so its quite common in my family to hear ghost stories, share experiences. I was about 13 years old i would hear the occasional footsteps when no one was around creeking of the floor. One day i did the most idiotic i could had possibly done i invited the ghost into my house. I was alone in the living room i heard a noise and i remember saying "" Its okay you can come out I'm not afraid of you. Show yourself! (Boy was i wrong) soon after unexplainable events started to happen.

    Following that i had a sleepover with 2 of my friends i was laying down on the floor staring at the doorway of my room while my 2 friends were on the bed. We we're watching Saturday morning cartoons when i look into the doorway during a commercial and i see a black figure, a black mass just peek inside my room slowly but surely. I was in complete shock i did not know what i had just witness. A black mass in shape of a person just peeked inside my room early in the morning. i quickly jumped on my bed of my friends hoping they had seen what i have seen. But they just looked at me like i was just pulling their leg.
  Another night i would be asleep in my room and i had a fan on my window. Late at night the fan kept making noises as if someone kept hitting it with a object. i thought it was a mechanical problem so i had gotten up to turn it off a little ball of fire circled around in the middle of the fan quickly circling around the blade and the hitting the floor i quickly turned it off. I never told my parents about it for fear of being told i was crazy
As a child i would sleep with my toys surrounding me around my bed i would always have my favorite Digimon toy on top of my television next to my bed as a sort of protection in my mind. i would always wake up it on the floor every morning. One night i fell asleep in the living room waking up to the sounds of foot steps. I then start to hear a toy of mine go off in my room. It was a 12 inch Buzz Lightyear the one in which if you touch the 3 buttons on his chest he would say 1 of his 3 catch phrases and also his laser button on his arm. As i was in the living room i can hear the toy go off in my room which was far along across the house. The laser button would keep sounding off and it would repeat his saying of ""Buzz Lightyear to the rescue."" I was in the living room close to crying because i felt helpless. i didn't go to sleep that night i stood up til 4 am hearing that laser and that phrase ""Buzz Lightyear to the rescue"" until my dad woke up to get ready for work. He then turned on the light in the kitchen and i got up and went to my room and grabbed the Buzz LightYear and it stopped going off. Ever since then it had never done that ever again. 
  The last strange event i remember was on the 4th of July. I was watching Thursday Night Smackdown with two of my friends. I remember watching a wrestling match and jumping on the couch. (The rest of my family went to my aunts house for a bbq. ) I remember jumping on the couch and then my computer screen turns on by itself and opens windows media player playing Marlyn Manson's ""Tainted Love"". I had a Compaq Presario at the time. To this day i don't know of any program on a computer that would set a timer to turn on my computer screen and start playing a song from my media player. Me and my friends freaked out and quickly ran out the house. My parents came back to the sight of their youngest soon sitting outside on the porch with his two friends scared to death.
  During these events i was told by my friend that lived in the basement of my house that they found something very strange in the laundry room. They found a picture of the former resident that lived in my basement. My cousin and her baby son also with her  underwear and paper filled with strange writings on it. I then put two and two together couple months prior to my friends moving in my cousin threw a Xmas party in the basement with a whole bunch of family and friends that would of had been the perfect window to plant such a thing. My cousins son had lost some of his skin due to burning he suffered as a baby. My cousin lost her job and nearly got deported. As a kid i remember some of my older cousins believing in witchcraft  and performing strange things with the other kids so i believe it was one of my family members that had planted the picture of my cousin

Rio Rancho New Mexico
 At the age of 15 i then moved to New Mexico with my family. I didn'oot experience anything til after a few months i started living at the new house. 
i woke up at 5:45am to take a shower so i can catch the bus at 6:30am. When i was walking towards the bathroom the bathroom light switched on and the door didn't close. I thought it was my dad perhaps using the bathroom and was too lazy to close the door so i waited next to door for him to finish. But i didn't hear anything coming from the bathroom i look in to see the bathroom being empty
I also would be awaken around in the morning to see in the corner of my eye a old man wearing a baby blue polo walking inside my yard walk past my window. I would only catch a glimpse of him and it would always be the back of his upper body and his blue polo. i always thought it was some old man that dropped something in my front yard. Our front gate would open and close at times we wouldn't think nothing of it though. Til one day i was in my sister's room using her computer with my two pet dogs when in the corner of my eye i clear as day see the old man walk past my sisters window into the yard. My dogs also seen him for they quickly began to bark and run to the front door. i also ran to the front door to see who he was for there is only one way in and one way out of my front yard. I open the front door run outside to my surprise i see no one in my yard. My dogs were more confused than me for they didn't even know what just happened.I moved out of New Mexico and back to Chicago  my sister and mom soon discovered a head stone next to our driveway after i left.
    I'm 23 years old now. I tell people these experiences I've had and i tell them all the same thing. These are things that actually happened to me i remember them so vivid. You don't have to believe me. But i know what happened and what i been through. But i thank you for taking the time out for reading.",,False,self,t5_2r1q4,False,,,True,t3_10kr21,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/10kr21/a_couple_of_stories/,

Seems more appropriate here.,patchy911,16,5,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/103j1q/repost_of_mine_from_rparanormal_seems_more/,"We had moved into this house about 3 months before the incident. Our family consisted of myself, my mother and step father, my brother (age 14), and my sister (7). The house is a single story with 4 bedrooms, 2 on 1 side, the master bedroom and a small room next to it which belonged to me. On the other side of the house were the other 2 rooms and in between was the living room, kitchen, and office area and the laundry room. My room was in the front left side and my little sisters was in the back right. Sorry about the detail just feels needed. Now to the actual story lol.

It was 3:09 one night and everyone was sound asleep when I'm woken up but a little girls voice faintly saying ""Mooooom"". It wasn't a quick 'Mom' like people usually say but the way someone would say it when calling for someone in the distance or one they can't find. I roll over and look at my clock and sit up my bed wondering if I had heard what I thought I heard. Maybe it was just a dream that I was having and surely If I waited I would hear either my sister calling for my Mom or nothing and I would go back to sleep knowing it was a dream. I sat there listening for a few minutes and after hearing nothing I laid back down. Within 30 seconds of me closing my eyes I hear ""MOOOOM are you there?, this time louder sounding as if it was right outside my parents door and mine. I jump out of bed to see what my sister wants or needs and am greeted with darkness. I have an instant feeling of uneasiness and I quickly walk over to my sisters room to see what was going on. When I opened the door to my sisters room I stood in the doorway for a few seconds and said her name. After getting no response I went over to her bed and said her name louder while seeing if she was sleeping. She was sound asleep. I made my way back to my room very confused. As I reached my door my mother opened hers. She walks out to me not wanting to wake my step father, and asks me did ""Lucy"", made up name, just call for me. My jaw dropped! ""You heard it too?"" I asked her. Yea she called for me twice I was getting dressed to go check on her she said. I told my mom that I had just come from her room I had heard the same thing but Lucy is sound asleep! Without saying a word we both knew what we had just heard, we looked at each other and I watched her cautiously, best word I can think of, make her way back to her room looking around. I slowly made my way back to bed and didn't hear anything else.

Two months later we were driving down a back road that we had never drove on because our neighborhood had just connected to it giving it 2 entrances so we thought we see what was back that way. We turned out of our neighborhood and about a mile down the road we see a plaque, a nice one, on the side of the road. We pulled over to see what it said and read something like this, 'In 1702 a massacre of the Apalachee Indians happened on this site. Men, Women and Children were slain without remorse. We hope that they find peace in the after life that was unreachable on this planet.

Supposedly, our family became Christian after my maternal great grandfather converted during an act of blasphamy. The story goes that he and two buddies decided it would be fun to troll the local church on a holiday back in the olden times. The group took the last pew in the church and had a fun time mocking the shouts and singing going on. This kept on as an old, gnarled woman slowly walked to the stove and scooped up her fill of hot coals. The woman eventually found her way to the back pew before she emptied the coals into my great grandfathers lap. He claimed he didn't move because he couldn't believe what he was seeing.

1310163199.0,11,self.Ghosts,ikf7t,"Messed with a Ouija Board, need some advice.",nicksnothome,14,3,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/ikf7t/messed_with_a_ouija_board_need_some_advice/,"The only reason why I am curious about this sort of thing is because my friends and I believe we have tampered into a world where we are not welcome. We truly believe we have upset someone somewhere, when that was not our intention at all. I will start from the very beginning of my story. It’s kind of long so please bare with me, oh and if you only intend to mock or deny any existence of the supernatural, please go away. I just want answers from those who know what they are talking about.  BTW i’m not skipping ANY details, so be patient, the story progresses I promise.

My dear friend Liz, a very strong minded girl decided to get spiritual with me one day. We talked of all the possibilities in the world, which are countless. We even talked of afterlife, that’s when she proceeded to question me about “playing” on the Ouiga board. I told her how I’ve been raised in the roman catholic church my entire life, and playing on a ouiga board was looked down on. I had no intent on even trying it until she told me various experiences she has had on the ouiga board. I was intrigued enough to question the thought of testing the waters..

I asked her how I would go about obtaining a ouiga board, she then told me I could make my own, on a piece of printer paper, lol? What? How does a piece of paper with letters, numbers, yes, no, good &amp; evil connect me to the spiritual world? Well..it did. And I called my old friend who died of cancer, he came, and talked to me and answered questions that only he would know.

Nothing strange or coincidental happened for the next few weeks. But eventually, things started to get weirder when I decided to play on the ouiga board again.

I went out one night with some friends and the next day I woke up to a text from my roommated telling me she had taken an entire bottle of ibuprofein and said bye. I rushed home as soon as I read it, I came home to her in a fetal position passed out on her bed with puke around her..I immediately called poison control and rushed her to the hospital. 

I decided to stay at my friend Nicks house, because he lived right down the street from the hospital and I wanted to be close to her. Nick started talking about how he had parties at his place and how his roommate, Joe, had a super wicked “glow in the dark ouiga board” that they would play with. He told me that there were points that they got a little disrespectful towards the ouiga board, such as talking about calling the devil and whatnot.

Nick and his friend Eric decided to play on the ouiga board while on 2CP (a psychadelic drug mixed with the psychoactive chemicals found in MDMA) and a weird chain of events followed..Nothing to important, just creepy.

Nick noted of “talking to the universe” and asking it questions.  He asked what the devils name was, and it replied “Beelzebub” which is known to be a Semtic deity, or one of the seven princes of hell. He is even described as satan in the New Testament. Just thought that was a strange corresponding event, but anyways back to the story..

The night I came over after the hospital, I was already in an altered state of mind, but was still tempted to play it again. As soon as we started playing, Nick told me he was getting super bad vibes. My friend Katie questioned him if it was coming from upstairs. Nick looked at her surprised and said yes.. they were both having feelings of angst coming from the same place. We put the board away and Nick had our friend Karen walk upstairs…he instructed her to turn the light on and as soon as she did so, the lights blew out.

I came over to Nicks house a few days later, to spend the night. I wasn’t even in the house 5 minutes before angst started to unfold again. I walked in to the kitchen and Nick went to flip the light switch, and as soon as he did so, the kitchen lights blew out. I didnt really think too much of it till I woke up the next  morning in complete shock.

I couldn’t open my eyes, I couldn’t open my mouth. I was laying stomach down and I heard someone faintly speaking, no one was in the room. I still fought to move and I felt immense pressure on my back. I finally was able to move and my friend Joe walked in, I wouldn’t let him leave. I was so scared all day..

Nick, Joe, &amp; I took it upon ourselves to go to a local wiccan/tarot reading shop to seek further help of how to remove and unwanted beings occupying Nick’s home. We told her of everything that had happened in the house, and she told us the best thing to do is burn sage through out the house, starting at the place where the ouiga board first introduced. She told us the proper way to burn sage to condemn unwanted spirits out. We went home, and brought out the ouigi board yet again, just to get some answers. We called any one in the room or house that we couldn’t see and proceeded to ask it questions. It seemed angry at first, so we called other people through the board. The board seemed to keep spelling “sage” and “gahan, or gaha” it was entirely strange.

Ever since then, weird things will happen here and there, and I’m not sure if it’s coincidental or if I really upset someone. I have been experiencing extreme feelings of doubt, late at night especially, like theres nothing to live for. And sometimes I feel even stronger feelings of apathy. And I feel like my will to do bad maybe increased since then. I was in the shower yesterday, when everyone in my house was asleep. Randomly the light turned off, and I figured it just blew out, but when I went to turn it back on, the switch was down, so someone had to have turned it off. No one can really explain that one, but it is making me super uncomfortable and I just want to get rid of any negative energy following me, or atleast make amends with it so it seems less like something is trying to make me feel like I am in danger.

Feedback is very much appreciated.

I am 16 years old. I have been in the same house since i was about 7. When i was younger, i always heard footsteps coming from both my kitchen and my living room which are on opposite sides of the same wall. I did have cats at the time, but these foot steps sounded heavier than a cats, and there was multiple steps, so i know it was the cat jumping on or off of something.

My second experience (and creepiest). I was in my room laying in my bed. My room shares a wall with my bathroom, and my bed was on that wall, and right under my windows. My tv is completely off, its about fall time, so we had neither AC or heat on. There were no storms either. I remember i heard a tapping on my window. There is a tree that doesnt reach the window outside, but i thought an animal loosened a branch, and it hit my window. But then i hear a tap on the wall connected to the bathroom. I got a little scared, but i didnt worry too much. Until... i heard three loud poundings on my door. Its also 2:30 in the morning. So i got scared and hid under my blanket.

The next morning i ask both my mom and brother if they were up last night at that time. Neither of them were, and neither of them heard it.

My last and most recent story. I was with a couple friends in my basement. Me and my two friends loved ghost hunting and paranormal stuff. So my friend did a saying that he said ""opens a demonic portal"". I didnt really believe him. He closed it shortly after. And after he did. We did a recording on a cell phone (dont judge, i was like 13 at the time) and when i played it back, i could faintly hear a girl scream in the background. But it was a shriek. Like she was about to be murdered. My mom and brother werent home, and i only had a third friend over, but he didnt make any noise and none of us heard it before we listened to the recording.

Therefore, I am posting it here.

Before I go any further, I would like to mention that this is not going to be one of those stories where you cant sleep after reading it. I am simply writing down my own personal experiences/observations for you the readers to draw your own conclusions. Also this is my first story to write down, so I apologize in advance for any rambling that may occur. I was always a partial skeptic when it came to anything paranormal. I always tried to rule anything psychological or physical that may be a cause for something ""paranormal"". That is until I spent a month living in Morton Hall at Northern Arizona University. It was June of 2008 and I had just received my acceptance letter from NAU for their STAR program, Student Transition And Readiness. As part of the STAR program you go and live on campus for the month of June before your freshman year begins. You along with 100 other freshmen live in the two traditional dorm halls, Morton and Taylor, while taking two classes. I myself stayed in Morton Hall. Traditionally Morton hall is strictly female while Taylor is strictly male. During STAR they become coed.
I had never heard of these halls before so I hadn't known of any haunting rumors. The program started off fine. We had a hall meeting on the topmost floor of the hall the first night to get acquainted with our RA and the rules of the hall. I didn't pay much attention to the RA speaking because what caught my attention was a door nearby covered with letters written to someone named Kathy. This struck me as odd because the door in question was a janitor closet. At the time I just assumed that Kathy was a janitor for the hall.
Nothing happened that first weekend. But once classes started and we formed our groups of friends things started to change. A bit of ironic humor I feel I must add for any of my friends from there, we named our clique of friends ""the Morticians"" because we lived in Morton Hall. I started hearing my new group of friends talking about Kathy. The rumors are hard to get straight but the general gust is she was a former student living in the hall sometime before 1950 who had hung herself in her bedroom on the top floor. When the renovated the floor they converted half of the room into a bathroom and the other half into a smaller dorm room.
Three members of our group resided on the third floor. One of whom, Hannah, was in the dorm half of Kathy's old room.
Some of the rumors of her haunting include noises in the basement, pulling off people's blankets, etc. Luckily for everyone the laundry room happened to be in the basement.
My first experience happened about four nights into my stay. I had just finished writing up a speech for one of my classes and was now laying down to sleep. I drifted off to sleep with no problem but woke two hours later freezing. My blanket was under my bed and the window was open. At this point I still did not know about the Kathy haunting so I thought nothing of it. That was the only time this happened to me. As I mentioned before, my friend Hannah was staying in the room rumored to be Kathy's old room. When we first met she was the typical bubbly blonde who got along with everyone. Very soon though her mood started to change, she would become increasingly lethargic and would cry for no reason, signs of depression. I truly believe it was her room causing this. When we came back to NAU that August and living in a different dorm she was back to her usual bubbly self, and still is four years later. My most eye opening experiences didn't happen till my last week there. As I mentioned before Kathy likes to take blankets apparently. I didn't really believe that till I saw it happen with my own eyes. I was laying down reading the Silmarillion. Across the room my roommate was already asleep. As I am reading my book I notice a strange noise coming from his side of the room. I look over and I could clearly see his blanket being pulled off of him and under his bed. I quickly turned on the light but could see nothing there. For the rest of my stay I spent as little time as possible in that room. My only other experience came when I was sitting on the couch in the basement doing laundry. The Morton hall laundry room is probably the scariest room in the building. You walk down a thin set of concrete steps into a low ceilinged basement the size of a basketball court. There are six sets of washers and dryers in the left half of the room. And on the other side of the room a steel door is set in the wall. This leads to the set of tunnels that lead under all the buildings and walkways of NAU. Access to these tunnels is forbidden to students and non NAU personnel. The entire room is lit by only the two fluorescent bulbs over the machines. The rest of the room is in varying states of perpetual night time. I'm in here at about two in the morning doing laundry. I am in the process of emptying a washer of its contents when I hear a noise from the far side of the room. A baby rattle, followed closely by a baby laugh. The noises are coming from this metal door. Curiosity gets the better of me and I start walking over to investigate. When I am within ten feet of the door the baby laugh comes again, this time accompanied by the clear voice of a woman. ""hello"" I hear from just inside the door. My whole body freezes. For the first time in my life I felt as if my ears were betraying me. Then I heard the rattle again. I ran back to the washer, finished switching out my laundry then ran up the steps to safety. I refused to get my laundry until a friend agreed to accompany me. Later that summer in the comfort of my own home in Phoenix, I did some research on Kathy. One of the popular stories is that she was the betrothed of a WWII soldier, who became pregnant before he shipped off. When she found out he was killed in combat she felt she could not live without him so she hung herself, thus killing herself and her unborn child. This I believe, based off my own personal experiences with Kathy's spirit, is probably the most accurate legend of her demise. I would love to get some constructive feedback from you guys. Tell me what you think about these experiences, or if you are a NAU student share some of your Kathy experiences.

The other night, something weird happened at 2:30am. Usually I'm not bothered by her commotion, because without fail, every night at 2-3am, my cat will run around the room like she's on kitty crack.
But anyway, I am startled awake by this super loud noise, brutal scratching on the scratching post. I sit up in bed, looking directly at the post, and say, ""HEY! STOP THAT RIGHT NOW!"" and the cat looks up at me, and runs under a small side table, pauses for one last look, then goes behind the futon. Being still half asleep, I turn around and flop back down into bed. I stretch my legs out all the way, and my feet hit something warm and heavy. It's my cat, asleep at the end of the bed, under the covers, and not too happy I woke her. The realization of what transgressed immediately freaks me out. I look for the cat I saw scratching (maybe there's a way a stray is getting in?), and find nothing. All I saw was the little baubles hanging down from the scratching post, swaying.

**TL;DR:** Woke up thinking my cat was scratching the post, shooed it away, then found out my cat was passed out at the end of my bed.

This is a little odd, but does anyone else believe in animal ghosts? My mom has recently moved into a new apartment, and has told me numerous times she has run into the ""ghost cat"". She says that, when she gets up in the middle of the night to use the restroom, this little kitty ghost will trip her up, or run directly across her path.",,False,self,t5_2r1q4,False,,,True,t3_szwk4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/szwk4/ghost_kitty/,

Im a 26 year old man and I have never before believed in ghosts or anything like that. I've never had any experiences with paranormal activities and that's mainly why I don't belive in it, until now.

A couple of weeks back I moved into a room in this old house that my aunt lives in, its an old family house. I had been told that it had ghosts and that weird things have been happening. Mostly noises, like footsteps and opening / closing doors, but a lot of the children that have been here and grew up here has always talked about people that the adults can't see. 

One example is this little girl about 2 years old, standing in the livingroom pointing at the door, telling us there is a man there. Also heard a story where my cousin got hit in the face by a small object that was standing on the tv. She was about 1 meter away and it gave her a bump.

It got to one point where my aunt ( who believes in paranormal things ) got this guy that get rids of ghosts, not sure what you call it in english ( Im european, trying my best! ). He got rid of some bad activity in the house and according to my aunt it's only good ""spirits / ghosts"" left.

I have no reason to think that my aunt or cousin is lying to me, and im open to the thought that maybe some of us are in touch with energies or something like that I can't get in touch with. At the same time I see the human brain as an amazing organ that can trick us into believing anything, your mind is your reality. 

Tonight I went to bed kind of early. My aunt lives over me so I can hear her when she walks around or move something upstairs. I know she went to bed early because I had dinner with her. After about an hour I started hearing footsteps. This went on and on and at first i thought it was my aunt just going to the toilet or something. But the footsteps werent like hers, and they were moving where I know there is furniture. Then I started hearing furniture move and I was sure my aunt was sleeping. 

I get up and I go outside and look up at the windows where she lives, pitch black. I go back in and go to bed and I start hearing the footsteps again. And then the furniture. This went on for about 45 minutes and now it's totally calm.

I know some of you might say I shoulda called to see if my aunt was really sleeping, well yeah, but I wouldnt want to wake her if she isn't, and she has told me that this is gonna happen from time to time :P ...

I will know for sure tomorrow when I talk to her, I've noted all the times I heard noises. Sorry for the long message, I just had to get this out somewhere, and I can't sleep. This is life changing for me, and so far I feel it is in a good way :)

PS! Sorry in advance for typos, im way to lazy to do anything about it right now :)

No one has ever said about my neighborhood being haunted, but I found out that during the Civil War injured soldiers took shelter in the caves and woods literally right behind my house.

Well, my buddy Brian and I used to go up in the woods and chill out and just get away from everything. It was a nice little place, it was a small-cave-like area and there was a waterfall right in front of it, with a nice view of the town. It was about mid-fall and the sun started going down around 5-6 I think. I noticed what sound like someone walking above us, sloshing of water and gravel moving around. So I jumped up, stepped out of the cave and instantly felt cold and kind of scared (goose bumps every where). By this time my buddy is walking right behind me, we both look up to see nothing but a dark silhouette, and I could feel it staring me down. I sat there for 10 seconds, staring back, scared shitless, until my I buddy Brian grabbed me by the arm and told me, ""Run."".
We did, and the whole 3 minutes I could feel this silhouette staring at the back of my head, breathing down my neck..a week later I got incredibly sick, couldn't stand and threw up almost every 3-4 hours.

Shorter story:
Early in the morning, same house as mentioned above, everyone just starting to wake up and getting ready for school/work. I'm outside walking my dog, and for some reason this morning, I felt like walking the back yard. The tree line for the woods is maybe 30 feet away from the back of my house. I'm sitting there, as my dog does his buisness, when I hear a twig snap. My head popped up and saw the same silhouette, staring at me. This time though, I didn't feel threatened, I felt curious. So I took 3 steps forward and my dog started to growl and bark at the figure, I looked down at him to tell him to hush. Looked back up and the silhouette was gone, but I could still feel it in the air. The first time I felt it, it was cold, hostile, fearful. But the second time, stale, empty and wanting. Nothing bad happened afterwards if I remember right.

I'm usually the life of a camp fire, because I have tons of great personal stories. I still get goose bumps just talking about them.",,False,self,t5_2r1q4,False,,,True,t3_1gujbb,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/1gujbb/just_a_few_things/,

My family was all gathered in the living room watching TV when I got up to go use the bathroom. I opened the bathroom door, walked inside, turned toward the bathroom door to flick the light on, and once the lights were turned on (yes, on) I saw dozens of golf ball sized orbs floating and swirling about the room. I could even see their reflection in my bathroom mirror just flying around. The orbs were perfectly spherical and were composed of some sort of white smokey substance. Within the swirling white smokey material were red, green and yellow lights just random flickering and swirling around within the smoke. I just stood there urinating in amazement. I never felt threatened and never tried to touch one or anything. I simply went about my business, washed my hands, and turned off the light. The second I turned the light off, they were all gone.

The house was pretty unremarkable. From the street it looked like a single story but had a basement. The backyard was a decent size, was fenced in and didn't face the any streets.

The basement was unfinished other than a bathroom. My grandpa had his own sort of man cave area down there with an old TV, a huge collection of National Geographics, some crappy section of thin carpet, and various bric-a-brac on what looked like old kitchen cabinets.

The whole family and friends are all together at the reception eating, drinking(as we Irish are wont to do), etc. The bathroom on the main floor was occupied so I think nothing of it and head for the basement door. Being a kid I was up and down those stairs enough to drive my grandparents nuts.

I open the door and step through while turning to close it behind me. I believe the light switch was actually located at the bottom of the stairs and naturally all the lights are off.

I take a few steps down, my view clearing the overhang above the stairs, and I freeze dead in my tracks. Over in my grandfather's area there's a silvery diamond shape that looks like chaotic water floating around in the general area. The shape was probably about a foot off the ground, four feet tall, 2 feet wide, and 2 dimensional.

I stand there frozen for several seconds, knowing that something is there. Breaking my freeze I fly up the stairs, throw the door closed behind me, find my sister, and proceed to hide under a table with a tablecloth. After calming down after a few minutes we go back to check.

Not a thing. Everything is as it should be in the basement.

When writing this I reflect back on a few things. Whenever I tell this story I get goose bumps and chills, as it was that profound of an experience. The spot where I saw the form was pretty much under the room my grandfather died in. There were some small windows(1' x 0.5') that faced the backyard at ground level, but this was not a cast light.

The form itself did not shed any light, but was light. It was not the same effect as staring into a light bulb and then looking away. While my gaze was static it was clearly moving and had a surface motion that I can only best describe as white caps on the ocean.

I've had several other creepy stories that I can get to in the future. I just learned today that I lost an uncle and am going back up to Ohio for the funeral, so this one is currently on my mind.",,False,self,t5_2r1q4,True,,,True,t3_q3xd4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/q3xd4/my_grandfather/,

I am really interested in the idea of ghosts because of my freshman class at college. We are reading all sorts of books. In the most recent book they use the ouija board as an example , often. I know how to start a seance and I know how to end one. I know what questions to ask and not to piss off the spirit. The only thing i am worried about is interrupting a summoning so to speak. Also, what if we say good bye and the ghost does not want to leave and is insistent? I know there are people out there that are as curious as I am. I know that there is the opposite of this too. If anything interesting happens i'll make sure to edit this post. For now, i'll get some candles and get my cross ready for my seance. Lastly, I know NOT to do this alone and I have a friend that will come along and do this with me.

EDIT: Alright the board came on thursday, and we decided to go right ahead and use it. Nothing happened. Later that night we decided to find a dark secluded area to use it again. It worked, but we got alot of misspellings or mumble jumble with the letters. Nothing of significance when asking the spirits questions about themselves. Today we went back to the original area and we got some more feed back. On two different spirits we got the constant spelling AMAMAMAMAMAMAMA...we have no clue as to what that could mean. We, however, did say goodbye too all the moon's.

EDIT: Sorry it has been awhile since I last updated this...well last time we went to a place that was haunted with a big group of people. Nothing really happened and the group called me out for lying or pushing the oracle. Well, we decided to let everyone have a chance...as I recall my first time nothing happened at all. The last group that went had the most odd thing to happen out of everything I have seen. They asked if anyone was there and it went straight to goodbye.

Now, before I get into this, note that I have never been a big person when it comes to the Supernatural. I've never really had an ""expirience"" nor do I claim to have seen this or that. That was until I started working at the Whidbey Playhouse, in Oak Harbor, Washington.

I'm stationed here in Oak Harbor, in the Navy almost out. I started volunteering at the Whidbey Playhouse, because I absolutely love acting, and can't wait to follow my dreams, yadda yadda yadda. So right now I'm working on the lights for a show that's off season. Spent 2 weeks getting all the timing down for the lights, and the music cues. Everything was going great.

But now I'm being haunted from start of the play to finish. The playhouse, which has been hosting shows now for 45 years, was actually an old church until it was converted into a playhouse. Rumors have been around for decades of it being haunted, but since my debut roll as Pete Bogg in Murder in the Magnolias, then improv work, and now lighting, I hadn't had a single encounter, and dismissed it all as rumors and people being a little too afraid of the dark.

It all started for me Yesterday when we were ready to kick off the new show that only lasted 3 days called Talking With, a show with an all woman cast. Every character goes out individually, tells there story, and then the next one goes out. Think: sooo artsy your head might explode. Trust me when I say as a 20-year-old guy, I would not go and see this play unless I was doing the lighting for it. As it turns out I was the only one who was capable, so here I am.

Anyways, I was talking to the photographer about my Navy life coming to an end soon (thankfully) when I saw a bright flash from inside the lightbooth room. I just thought, the laptop had just turned on, or maybe the screen saver I didn't know about had kicked in. Around 3 minutes later, is when I hear a tremendous boom from upstairs. The door next to the lightbooth, where we keep all the lighting supplies, rips open with force. Then the the lightbooth door's handle turns (it has a unique old sound to it) and also gets forced open. As soon as they were opened, they both immediately slammed shut.

The photographer and myself were the only ones inside the theater at the time. Suzanne, the director of the show, was downstairs in the main lobby. (I later found out she had been inside of her car grabbing her purse.) The photo lady started laughing her ass off, and saying, ""There he is again! Looks like he has the opening day jitters too!"" I'm almost pissing myself at this point, but I laugh it off, and think nothing of it, only that I have to be up there for the next 3 days for 3 hours at a time (SHIT).

I got off work today (7/23/2011) at around 3pm, and headed for another day at the playhouse. Before that, I decided to get myself a DVR and bought a Sony at the Navy Exchange. I can't remember what model, but it lasts for 53 hours of recording. Before the show, I took the steps that led up to the steeple and left the DVR recording in the storage room where all the ""activity"" was.

From the start of the show tonight, to the end, the light had been going on and off, and the door had been opening up behind me, and quitely closing. When I got up to leave the room for intermission, I had found the dead bolt on the door had been turned to the locked position, thus locking me inside the room. Thankfully the lock was on the inside, so I flipped it and quickly got downstairs.

After the intermission was over, I came back up to the room and found an audio cable connected to the headphone jack on the sound board that wasn't there before. I dismissed it--maybe somebody had gone upstairs during intermission to mess with me while I was outside catching my breath. There was also a odd smell, almost like beef jerky (??) that filled the light booth and storage room. I had checked to see if the DVR was doing alright right before I left.

2 shows ago, I got to hear the directors encounter story. She had been painting the set with one other person (the producer for the current show). The playhouse was otherwise locked. Suddenly the both heard a voice as clear as day say, ""Speak loudly, otherwise you'll not be heard!"" They both made there exits immediately. I hate to say that I have to go back there tomorrow, but I do :(. I'll take pictures, and after the show. I will faithfully listen to the entire recording, and hopefully if I pick something up, I'll put it on here for you guys. Thanks for listening, and hopefully I survive ;)

I may be a skeptic, but I do like coming here and reading your posts. I was wondering if you had any opinions on what I'm about to write. I've never been quite able to rationally explain it.

Before my younger sister came along (when I was 3) my family and I used to live in a one bedroom flat. I only vaguely remember that my older sister and I stayed in the same bedroom as my parents, only sectioned off by a large curtain for privacy. I apparently used to dream about a big face appearing on the curtain and staring at me, not saying a word. I would wake up screaming and refusing to go back to bed too.

Anyway, we eventually moved when my younger sister came along to a 3 bedroom house. I had a happy childhood, don't get me wrong, but when I was alone upstairs I would sometimes hear something whisper my name from my parents room. I never answered it, and I would always run off downstairs as quick as I could. Whenever it happened I had this overwhelming sense there was something evil near me.

I would also have a regular dream that I was in the car with my family, driving up a hill towards a shelter/bunker like structure. The same thing that whispered my name would be inside, calling me to come to the building.

I had no idea it existed at the time, but my dad later took my sisters and I here; http://youtu.be/E8i5F2-CeyI and it looked exactly like the building in my dreams. I felt an overwhelming sense of fear and insisted we leave as fast as we could.

I've not had a 'paranormal' incident otherwise, despite living in one of the most 'haunted' towns in south-east England (Guildford, which is apparently haunted enough to have a weekly ghost tour and several books written on the subject).

Me and my girlfriend live together and her father lived with us.

Sadly, he passed away in his sleep at the beginning of April.

A few days ago, I was at the apartment waiting for her to come home so I could start dinner. I had Cartoon Network's [adult swim] on in the background as I surfed the internet. At some point, I got up and went into the kitchen to prep dinner. I took some fish filets out of the fridge and laid them out on a baking sheet and seasoned them and put the sheet into the fridge. When I came back into the bedroom, I immediately noticed the TV. I spent a moment wondering what show I was seeing, because it didn't seem like a usual [adult swim] show, then noticed the CBS channel logo. I thought it was a little odd but changed the channel back to Cartoon Network and chalked it up to Comcast being, well, Comcast; maybe the cable box reset in the 5 minutes I was out of the room, totally possible, right?

A few days later, we wake up and her Final Fantasy XI authenticator is not in it's normal spot, a tack above her desk. It's sitting on my desk!

[Picture for reference](http://imgur.com/H9LkmLB)

Now, I don't play FFXI and I have never even touched her authenticator, I have no need to! She hasn't played in a few weeks either!

It's not even possible for it to have fallen, because the tack and the pipe necklace were still in place and even if it HAD fallen off the tack somehow, it would have had to get over the necklace and somehow move about a foot sideways while falling.

We've talked about the odds that maybe one of us moved it (for whatever reason) while half asleep or something but the only ""rational"" explanations we can think of are still pretty unlikely; we don't sleepwalk and we notice when the other gets out of bed at night.

At this point, we're not scared, just confused. Other than those two events, nothing unusual has happened.

After a week of nothing, I decided that it must have been a one time thing and relaxed.  This morning I was about to go down to the basement to go get some laundry and as I'm approaching the front door I see the handle is turning back and forth and jiggling.  My immediate thought is that my husband must have forgot something at home and came back to get it.  As I approach the door, it pushes open, but no one's there!  Now I'm freaked out because apparently ghosts can unlock doors!  This makes me nervous it could lock me out of the house if it wanted to.  I call my atheist husband immediately and explained what happened.  I wanted to keep him on the phone with me in case something happened when I got the laundry.  Nothing more happened, but even he's starting to believe that it must be a ghost because how does a door unlock itself?  

So I know that the prevailing theory on this subreddit is that I'm being haunted by a ""helpful ghost"".  After all, it did open the door for me which could be seen as a helpful gesture.  However, all these ""nice things"" it does freaks me out.  As I mentioned in my last post, I had made a truce with the ghost/s a year ago and I liked living in a house with no activity.  Do you have any suggestions on how I can get the ghost to stop?

I have encountered many casual activity since i was 6, the fist time was when i was sitting on my windowledge looking outside into the night with the lights out when i heard a bang from  behind me, i turned on the lights and saw my teddy on the other side of the room from where it was, i had no brothers or sisters at the time so i cant think of another explaination but the paranormal.
The next incident is at 11 years old, i was moving house from where the first incident was and at a final glimpse, i saw a pale boy looking out of my bedroom window as i was driven away, he seemoed to be frowning, note that this was a very old house so there could have been a shitload of ghosts i hadn't encountered, the next incident is only a year ago, i was 13 and lying in bed (due to what had happened before i sleep with a faint light on and music playing) my music was playing rather quietly and suddenly increased volume dramatically, i went to check it out and turns out it was no malfunction, the volume slider had been turned up and that creeped me right the fuck out, note i still had no siblings and i had moved house again to a fairly old one.
The next incident was in the same night, i felt something poke my back, even though it was facing into the matress, so i sat up and my light started flickering and my Assassin's creed poster got taken down, all pieces of blu-tak at once.
The final incident is in my dad's house, my parents are divorced and i go to my dad's house in weekends, i felt something touch my arm and when i looked there i heard a metallic scream in my right ear, this was last night.

It's tucked into some woods, and if you've never been shown it, you would never know it's there. It's at the end of a dead end road. A majority of the markers belong to children, and mostly of one couple. I'm guessing victims of TB, since it would fall in that era. Late 1800s, early 1900s. The farm house that used to sit on the property burned down years ago. I'm told that some remains of the basement and items that fell into the basement during the fire still remain, but I've not confirmed that since it's grown up with a lot of brush and trees. Anyway, myself and 2 friends checked out the cemetery one night, cameras in hand. As soon as we stepped over the 2' stone wall surrounding it, one of the cameras has a total battery drain. Great! We walked around the small cemetery for a bit with nothing noticeable happening. Since, at that time, we didn't know the location of the house, we decided to go walking through the rest of the woods. Remember, this is at the end of a dead end road, which happens to be in an industrial park at around midnight. Nothing was open when we drove back there. So... into the woods we go. After walking around a bit we heard a ""cat"". Nothing unusual. Then we heard it again, only it was on the other side of us. A little unusual. Heard it again, and it appeared to be circling us. No sounds of running, but making great time getting around us. Heard it a few more times, completing the circle. The other 2 found it easy to push off as being a cat, so I i accepted that as fact. 

Now the good part... Shortly after hearing the ""cat"", we ALL heard what sounded like screaming. Not a single scream from a single person. Several screams from many people... kids! It wasn't close, but it wasn't that far away either. The screams turned in to what sounded like laughing. We heard it a few more times (I even made a joke about it being more cats. lol). It sounded like it was coming from just outside the woods, which aren't very big. We headed back to the car (after it stopped) and drove around a bit to make sure there wasn't a group of kids messing with us. Nothing! Later, I found out that the house that burnt down was in the direction that we heard the screams/laughs come from.

I was able to capture this on camera. I'm thinking the video is a little long, so if anyone is interested in hearing the ""cats"" and the ""kids"", I can note the time and share the video.

My wife and I live alone and it was about 6 am. I don't think it was a dream because I was dreaming about something completely unrelated and it sounded external. And why would I jump up with my heart racing. 

Maybe it was my wife sleep talking in between snores but I really don't think so. It didn't sound like her voice and it seemed like something was intent on waking me up.

What was it that got you interested in this field?,dameggieweggie,7,1,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/hazhy/most_people_who_become_interested_in_ghosts_do_so/,"I'll start.

When I was about 15-16, my best friend and I would have sleepovers at her house about every other week or so. We had all kinds of crazy, unexplainable things happen over the course of about a year to a year and a half.

The most regular/disturbing thing that happened would be this banging against the wall. My best friend had her bed against the wall and on the other side of the wall was the living room with a very large wooden bookcase against the wall. All night, we would hear banging coming from the other side of the wall that sounded as if someone was running head-on at the wall and throwing all their weight against it. When you held your hand against the wall, you could feel the vibrations every time there was an impact. When we went out to the living room to investigate, there was no one there. What's more is that big bookcase was full of figurines and porcelain pieces. None of the pieces had been moved despite the fact that the amount of force we felt in the vibrations should have knocked many of the pieces onto the floor or even broken them.

On one night, we heard noises coming from the backyard. My friend had a large window in her room that opened into the backyard so we pulled the blinds and saw a large black shape that looked like a man hunched over run across the backyard very fast. We screamed and her mom immediately came to see what was wrong. A few seconds later, we were in the backyard looking around and no one was there. What made it creepier was that my friends backyard was surrounded by slick stone walls about 6 feet high so it would have been difficult for anyone to have climbed in or out of the yard.

Another creepy thing happened late at night when I was walking down her hallway. I saw movement out of the corner of my eye and turned to look into the kitchen. I watched as a plate (apparently by itself) slid off the counter and onto the floor without breaking. It looked like someone had picked the plate up and put it on the floor.

As I grew older and we stopped having sleepovers, I dismissed everything that had happened to us as an over-active imagination and pipes settling. I assumed there had to be some reasonable explanation and being a silly teenager, I just didn't know what they were.

A little over a year ago, I was at home with my parents for Christmas. My dad was watching a ghost hunters marathon. I sat down to watch it with him for a few minutes while I ate a bowl of ice cream. I started to get the chills as the show mentioned common experiences such as unexplained bumps/noises and thick black masses. My dad started to enthusiastically tell me more common traits of a ""haunting"" and I started getting more chills as he described many things I had experienced at my friends house although I had never told another person about it.

Even though I don't really consider what I experienced at my friend's house a true experience because it was a long time ago and it was never properly investigated, I do credit these experiences coupled with coincidentally watching the show with my dad for getting me interested in this field. 

tl;dr Creepy experiences at my friends house coupled with seeing a ghost hunters show years later made me want to look for explanations",,False,self,t5_2r1q4,False,,,True,t3_hazhy,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/hazhy/most_people_who_become_interested_in_ghosts_do_so/,

These 3 or 4 little stories are nothing crazy, no demons, or monsters or anything. Instead little subtle things that made the hair on my neck stand up and would genuinely just creep me the fuck out. Everything that happened would happen in my room only and usually when it was just me around.

First one was when I had just moved in the apartment. Still in the process of unpacking cloths and what not. So as Im doing this I decide to smoke a bowl. I take a few hits and start unpacking more. I go back and cant find my lighter. I looked EVERYWHERE, I had it 1 minute earlier and didn't even leave the room. After 5 minutes of looking I see it sitting on top my dresser. I KNOW I checked there 4 or 5 times and I couldn't possibly have missed it. I just froze for a second and couldn't process what happened. I checked the house for people and nobody. I was so spooked i went the the store to get a coffee, didn't want to be there haha.

Another story from when I was home alone. I had a broken bong in the back of my closet for about 3 months. Forgot it was there. I went to the kitchen from my room for not even a minuite. When I return the bong which I completly forgot about was in the middle of the room. I was like wtf??? Since I was a bit more used to things happening like this now.

And I will never forget the time we were having a party at the apartment. Me and 3 of my friends we smoking a blunt in my room in a circle. When all of a sudden I see a bottle cap on my hardwood floor slide about 2 feet into the middle of our circle. I asked if anyone else say that and they all just slowly said yes. They were pretty spooked about that haha. I was too, there was no cats in the room or anything else even near the bottle cap to make it move.

So I got some more similar stories if you guys like these, Nothing bad ever happened but that room always creeped me out. I would wake up in the middle of the night, wide awake with that feeling like someone was watching you. I hated that. Thank goodness I'm out of there.

We walked around for about 30 minutes, following the lazy twists of the path that went through the graveyard.  When we reached the end, we turned around and headed back to leave, laughing that we had the balls to do what we did, and glad we didnt see anything.

About halfway back we saw two , well, lights hovering in front of a bush. IN FRONT.  There was no way that I could think of that these lights could be a reflection, and they seemed to be about eye-width apart.  They ""blinked"" once, and then disappeared.  All four of us made excuses as what they could be, and then continued walking.

Mike and I decided to cut across the graveyard to the exit, while the other two guys decided to respect the dead and walk the path.  As soon as Mike and I stepped off the path, we both saw what I can only describe as a ""shadow on the air"".  Now, I dont need to tell anyone that shadows need a surface to exist, but this thing was in the air about 10 feet from us.

We didnt feel cold, we didnt hear anything.. but we were both scared.. Mike took off to catch up to the other guys, and since Ive always considered myself a non believe in anything, well, I stayed.  It seemed to kinda shift and change shape just a bit, and when I took a step back onto the path (I was scared), it turned whiteish, formed a characture of a face in agony, and just sort of evaporated to the right, like it was fleeing.

I RAN to catch up to my friends, and we left the graveyard.  When we got to the bottom of the hill two cops pulled up and grilled us, and were pretty cool about it... they said they hated going into the graveyard.

Has anyone else heard anything like this? Ive seen a few things in my life that my rational head cant get a grip on.. and every-time Ive been with other people, so I dont think its just my head.",,False,self,t5_2r1q4,False,,,True,t3_cco9e,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/cco9e/my_ghostsighting/,

1324877490.0,3,self.Ghosts,nqvyb,I told my boyfriend about my some of my ghosts experiences but he didn't say anything. Advice about my experiences?,PearlnPip,5,2,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/nqvyb/i_told_my_boyfriend_about_my_some_of_my_ghosts/,"First off, this isn't a post isn't about the interaction between me and him. I'm writing this because at the end of the conversation, I've realized that I don’t know how to change the situation towards a direction in which I feel safe. I feel that I have had random experiences with what I perceive as evil for what is going on 10 years. It is dream based but what happened never seemed to match up with my regular sleep patterns. I’m asking for advice on what I can to do that may prevent any future occurrences. As a background note, I’m not particularly religious and I have a degree in engineering. I try to approach things rationally but I have always had an open mind and interest in all things paranormal. 

Here’s the story:

When I was 13 or so, my family moved one state over. And from there, it seems that everything began. Prior to moving I never had paranormal experiences. The rational part of me wants to say that moving and adolescence played its toll on me but I can’t discount my own perception and reality.  I had a few spooky things happen to me but it didn’t seem like a big deal. One night I passed out in bed and dreamt that I was in a room on fire. As I ran out, a black shadowy figure sprayed me with the hose. At that instant, what felt extremely cold in the dream was sending deep shivers down my spine and I remember shaking in bed. Within a week or so, I had two more dreams featuring this person and the same sensation as before. 

When I was 21, I studied abroad and I lived in a small single efficiency apartment.  I fell asleep next to my laptop. I was watching some game show that I picked up through my TV tuner. From the instant that I closed my eyes, I felt two hands press my shoulders into the bed. I told myself that I needed to wake up but I couldn’t. Something wasn’t clicking. In this dream state, I looked around and my room looked all the same, except a dark shadowy figure was on top of me pining me to the bed. When I looked up at it, I looked for a face but I didn’t anything but darkness. I felt things radiate from it. It truly hated me and took pleasure in my panic. It radiated feelings I can’t even conjure up. A mix of what I imagine is the worst of malice, evil, spite, hatred, malevolence, something in which I never want to feel again. It sickens me that I could picture it smiling at me and laughing without even as a word from its face.

Probably the most embarrassing part of the story that will turn into this being a throwaway account, what I would likely call ghost pr0n:

It tried to rape me. By try, I mean I could feel things. I could FUCKING feel things downstairs and I wanted it to stop. I kept saying that I needed to wake up. All I wanted to do was wake up. It felt like an eternity for that even happened. Finally I was able to snap out of it and I finally woke up. I checked back at the laptop and I was perhaps asleep for a minute or two. I got up and checked the windows and doors but everything was locked. 

What may or may not be related but I often don’t tell this part. Hence, now is a throwaway account:

I woke up the next morning with an extreme pain in my tailbone. It felt similar to when I sprained my tailbone and I thought that somehow I injured it while I was sleeping. After a week or so, it didn’t end up getting better and was actually a cyst. I ended up on antibiotics and eventually healed up. I find this is all embarrassing and such a bizarre coincidence. I wouldn’t like to at all thing they are related because that would frankly be such a disgusting joke about demon stds. I included it as a detail because of the timeline.
 
After that, I feel that evil has the ability to finds us anywhere anytime. I figured that the recurrence of this figure poses as a threat to me spiritually and emotionally and perhaps physically. I’m uncertain that it will happen again but if it does, I am not sure that I would have much of a fight. It scares me that I don’t have a safety blanket. I can’t hide behind religion and beg for the protection of god because I often question his/her existence. I often wonder if this was punishment for that and I should throw myself blindly back into my prior upbringing as a catholic. 

I am 23 now. I have not seen this figure since. However a few weeks ago, I was half asleep and I thought something was talking to me from the corner of my room next to the door. It had a creepy childlike voice and was telling me to do harmful things. I don’t think this was a big deal but it reminded me of prior events and my reinforced fear of unworldly things.

tl/dr; I have had several dream like experiences that include an evil dark shadowy figure trying to frighten me with various tactics.  
 
So Reddit; any advice or comments?

with spirits",TheMentoMan,6,6,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/v0iww/someone_told_me_i_have_the_gift_of_communicating/,"Hello Ghosthunters,

I only just discovered this subreddit and I hope you can help me find some answers. 

Coming from a Greek family I was always raised with the idea of energies and spirits. But I never felt very much connected to those energies or spirits. I am a very emotional and empathetic being and so I do believe I connect to other people on a level that not everybody can, but I never saw or spoke to ghost. I'm not entirely sure yet how I feel about this topic, but I definitely have an open mind.

Anyway, last year I was working as a runner on a film set and a co-worker (who I knew was very spiritual) came up to me and told me that I have the gift of communicating with ghosts and that surely I must have encountered some in my lifetime. I was a bit taken aback, that comment had come completely out of context. He said that he doesn't have the gift himself, his gift was to see the spiritual abilities in other people. He said it was very scary and it's very scary for people like him to meet someone like me. This threw me off even further as I'm a young woman in her early 20s and that guy was this experienced, hardboiled bad-ass in his 60s. Why would a guy like him be afraid of me? Unfortunately, I tend to freeze up when I'm startled, so I didn't get a chance to investigate what he meant further. And I didn't have the ovaries to approach him about it for the rest of the film shoot. 

So now I'm wondering, do I have a gift and simply haven't realised it? I met a woman once who claimed to be able to see other people's auras. She said she had never believed in that stuff and one day she just started seeing auras everywhere. Could it be that I simply haven't found a way yet to channel my gift? Or is that all just in that guys's head? But if not, why would a spiritual person be afraid of someone like me? What exactly would it mean to be able to connect with spirits? My family taught me that only children have this gift, and I saw my brother once, when he was two years old, point up and say 'grandmother' in Greek, even though there was nothing there. She had died two months before his birth. Granted, 'grandmother' in Greek is very easy to say for a toddler and who knows what he really meant. But that image of him pointing up still lingers in the back of my mind and I keep wondering if there's more to it.

I hope someone can give me more insight on this, please feel free to direct me to another subreddit if this one isn't the right place for this post.

**TL;DR: A colleague told me he can see spiritual powers in other people and saw that I have the gift of connecting with spirits. I'm now wondering if this might be true and how I could learn more about this gift.**",,False,self,t5_2r1q4,False,,,True,t3_v0iww,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/v0iww/someone_told_me_i_have_the_gift_of_communicating/,

His house is haunted, and we had proof, but it got deleted. I wont tell you all the experience there, but i'll tell you mine.

Ghost Orbs-
I took my cellphone (yes, cellphone, dont hate) and took some pictures with it. I love the paranormal, so i know what an orb looks like. I took these three pictures that made me feel unwelcome in his house. The first picture, there was an orb, with a tail of mist falling behind it, almost looks like a zoomed in version of an artists rendition of shooting star. The second picture i took, it was headed at me, and the third picture, nothing was there. Before i looked at the pictures, i got a chill on my back. A really cold chill.

EVPs-
There were two EVP recordings we got. I'll tell the less freakier one first. My friend had just gotten a real evp recorder. Knowing his house is haunted, we sat only in his room, which is in his basement, with his door open. After recording, we listened to it and hurt a deep, low, growl that by the sound of it, sounded like it came from the other side of his basememt (the side we believe to be the most haunted part of his house). He has dogs, but small yipping dogs, nothing that could make that noise.

The second evp scared me. I was recording a video on my cellphone in the haunted part of his house, and after not capturing anything i turn it off and play it back to look over it more. Nothing was caught on footage, but i caught what sounded like a conversation. The first part didnt really sound like anything, almost like white noise, but after that i heard a ""No"". And this was a firm deep low. And it actually sounded like it might have replied from something i said earlier, which all i asked was if there were any ghosts, and if there were, they should show themselves. I also feel like ever since i was little i was being followed by a ghost, or a few of them.",,False,self,t5_2r1q4,False,,,True,t3_1gt7gy,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/1gt7gy/i_just_posted_about_my_house_last_night_but_heres/,

They describe him as wearing something like a sailor suit and said that he seemed happy to see them.

It is not him that I am worried about. I get a feeling of dread and the feeling of being watched at random times throught my home. It mostly occurres when I look at my mirrors or am alone in my basement. There have been times when a chair has moved at my dining room table or at my desk when no one was home except for me. Around those times, it seems like I see shadow figures moving around.

I don't know if this is bad or what, but I would just like to know. It seems strange to ask nosleep for help, but people here seem to be very knowledgeable.

Not doing anything myself right now but I did have questions for other ghost searchers/hunters. 

Some people have reported ghosts effecting the electromagnetic field and have influence on electronics. Also often time people mistake electric fields for ghosts. If there is a possibility of electrical interference and correlation with equipment and ghosts, what about the equipment using to document/measure ghosts? Cameras, voice recorders, anything used, is it possible that these can cause interference and possibly prevent a ghost from being observed or cause measurements to be distorted? I imagine to prevent this would possibly having a case around said equipment to reduce the amount of electrical energy being emitted.  

Please note I have little knowledge of physics and could be sprouting complete nonsense, correct me if I am. Just wondered since I've people try to detect ghosts from devices that pick up electric fields (right terms?) and can easily pick up something electronics or wall outlet.


Second, has anyone done a long term research period to detect a ghost? I've really only seen small things on youtube or ghost hunters which of course probably have very little credibility but I've never seen anyone spend more than a couple days at a location to find a reported ghost. Has anyone spent longer? Week? Month? We have no patterns known of how they work and cannot expect to get sufficient evidence from a night or two. We don't know if they are limited on what and when they can do or if its in bursts or anytime they want. Not to mention if these are deceased people you have to factor in psychological variables. Who knows what the ghosts behavior is. It may be shy, it may only appear under certain conditions it deems appropriate which is completely up to it.


Sorry for long wall of text.
**TLDR: Don't seem to see people talk about methods or variables of ghost hunting that could have a big impact.

A group of about 10 of us were investigating the side theater when someone saw some strange shadow movement backstage. So we all went up to look.

Other than some dim lighting coming from underneath a closed door, we were in near pitch darkness. But looking across the stage, you could make out some circuit boxes on the opposite wall once your eyes adjusted to the dark.

After standing there for about 5 minutes, I got all staticky, a sign that something paranormal is about to go down. (You know, when all the hairs on your body stand up...)

Soon after, my field of vision... collapsed upon itself. It's the only way I can describe it. Everything slowly got darker and darker until I couldn't see anything for a brief second.

We try bloody mary and the whole nine of course none of it working. So were sitting in the living room with my friends parents out in the garage drinking with some of their friends. This is where it got wierd.

We were all 3 in plain sight of my friends parents room. We could see inside and everything. Also we could see the door to the garage. (You can pretty much see the whole house from the living room). Anyway we were just sitting talking about what we were gonna do next when we starting hearing a weird vibrating noise. It sounded like somthing rattling on somthing its hard to describe, but its coming from in my friends parents room. 

So after sitting there trying to figure out what the hell it was we go in the room to see. It was coming from his moms side of the bed in her dresser. We open the drawer and its her vibrator, out of the box rattling around in the drawer. Disgusted, a tiny bit scared, and laughing we ran out basically agreeing no one was touching that thing. So we just sit back in the living room and talk about how awkward its honna be when she hears it.

Meanwhile the thing is just rattling away. Finaly we hear his moms voice get closer to the garage door. So were all excited because its going to be funny when she hears it. The EXACT second she opens that door it stops. She gors in the fridge mixes another drink then goes back out. At that point were all like wtf. So we go in her room look in her drawer and the vibrator is SEALED back in the box and no one had been in that room.

Like i said a little scary but really funny and actually completly true. Nothing else past that ever happened but i could never explain it. Hope you guys had a good laugh.",,False,self,t5_2r1q4,False,,,True,t3_11eag6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/11eag6/tiny_bit_scary_but_mostly_funny/,
1350078467.0,0,self.Ghosts,11dxn6,looking for some advice?,bearface93,2,2,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/11dxn6/looking_for_some_advice/,"I'm pretty sure my house is haunted, but I'm not 100% sure yet. Does anyone have any tips for me to prove it?

Some background... I'm 19 now, and the first time I can remember something paranormal happening in my house is when I was about 6 or 7. My great grandma died when I was 5, and starting about a year or so later (I can't remember exactly) I started seeing this white mist drifting near my open door at night. After about a month of seeing this every night, while I was looking at it it took the form of my great grandma. It was only a silhouette but I'm positive it was her. I haven't seen it since. 

I didn't experience anything else paranormal until my freshman year of high school I believe. I have always been interested in the paranormal but hadn't experienced anything (in my house at least) since I saw my great grandma. Anyways, I started staying up after everyone else went to bed and I would hear things coming from the living room (I usually stay in the family room and watch tv at night). It started with what sounded like someone getting out of the rocking chair in the living room (it makes this really loud clunking noise when you get out of it) but after a while it would sound like someone walked into the entertainment center a couple seconds after getting out of the chair. I am always uneasy when I'm in or near that room unless I'm with a bunch of people. My friends are ALWAYS uncomfortable being there, and always leave as fast as they can. My one friend has always been able to sense ghosts, and one of the last times we were in that room alone she said she felt threatened, like whatever was in there didn't want her there. Even my friends who don't believe in ghosts don't like that room. Anyways, I've heard the aforementioned noises in there, I've been touched multiple times in that room and in the family room. One night I was watching tv and my grandma's (I live with my mom and grandparents) sweater was on the arm of the chair I was sitting in. I went into the kitchen to make some food and when I went back in the family room the sweater was behind the chair. One night a couple years ago I went out with some friends and got home before 2am and went right to bed. My mom told me the next day that my grandma had woken up around 4 and heard banging downstairs, like I was throwing stuff around or I had people over and we were being obnoxious. She went downstairs and all the lights were off and nothing had been moved. The stairs are next to the living room, and one night I was going to bed and after I turned off the light at the bottom of the stairs something pushed me up them. That really freaked me out.

I haven't even gotten to the upstairs yet. Recently (in the past year or so) I've been getting activity in my room. It started when I had just laid down to go to sleep and I heard a voice that kind of sounded like my dad's yell my name in my ear. I've been in the bathroom (which is next to my room) on multiple occasions and heard voices and once singing coming from my room, even over the shower. Over the summer I took some pictures of my room to see if I could capture anything and I have a ton of orbs and in one picture it looks like there is a young woman with shoulder-length dark hair and a dark cami standing in front of my window. It might be matrixing though, I'm not completely sure. One of the orbs seemed to have a face in it as well.

Another thing I've noticed is my dog. Starting my senior year of high school, I would sometimes hear my dog's tags jingling in the upstairs hallway. Since I've been in college, whenever I'm home and really stressed or sad or anything like that, I'll either hear his tags or feel him brush up against my leg. He was a little dog (a yorki-poo) and he used to curl up at my feet. I've felt that a couple times recently too. My friend from before has also seen him a couple times, once in my kitchen while we were cooking and later that night when I walked her home (she lives down the street from me) she said she saw him sitting under the tree in my front yard watching us. All of the things I've mentioned, except with my dog, have started happening during the day as well as at night within the last year or so. 
I have captured a couple EVPs too but they're really bad quality. One sounds like a stomach gurgling but if you listen really closely you can faintly hear ""help me."" Another from the same night sounds like footsteps on wood (the dining room and living room have hardwood floors). I caught those in the family room.

**TL;DR** weird shit has been happening at my house and I'm convinced it's haunted.

I want more proof that my house is haunted besides the pictures and EVPs. My friend from before and I have seen shadow people in our neighborhood so maybe they're related? She has had quite a few experiences in her own house, maybe I'll post those later. Our development isn't old, only built in the 1960's, and my grandparents are the 2nd owners of my house. The first ones were only there for a few years. Does anybody have any ideas as to how I can get more evidence of a haunting in my house? I would really appreciate it. Sorry about the length of this by the way. This is my first post and I just kind of rambled. I'll add any more experiences as I remember them.

first most ghost sightings are totally non-violent, its just doors closing sinks turning on pressure on peoples limbs figures in photos basically these "" ghost"" are just living with no idea they are ghost. also electrical disturbances are commonly reported lights turning on or off, emf meters going off, voices on audio recordings. here is were all my science channel comes into play, almost everything we know about wormholes and ripples in space/time is totally theory. technically a wormhole could pop up anywhere and it doesn't technically have to be some huge event. what if ghost sightings and paranormal activity is actually small disturbances in space/time that give us a small glimpse into the past or future. basically time traveling ghost. feel free to tel me why this is totally wrong or not!

She emailed them to me, and is really freaked out about it. She is a very logical woman who is open to paranormal ideas but isn't obsessed over them. If anything I never thought this sort of thing would effect her in such a dramatic way.

Just to let everyone know, she was driving from one state to another, and GPS took her down a dead end path. While driving down the path (thinking it was the scenic route) she realized it was verging on private property based on the way the road was looking. All the while she was taking pictures, basically because it was a odd occurrence for her GPS to do this. Once it resembled a private road, she started to freak out, and stopped taking pictures.

Pictures resumed once she came upon the dead end and farm houses. She did resume pictures at that point. From both of those points, this is what she sent me. She doesn't ""get into"" things like this, and she has actually lost sleep off of it. Some of the pictures she already cropped/added contrast, because she was so freaked out, and wanted to see more. I know they are distorted, but some of them are too much for me to dismiss.

Many interesting and bizarre experiences.  This story I am about to tell you is not a personal experience of mine, but is a collection of stories that have been passed down from Father to Son, Grandfather to Grandchildren.  All of the Elders in my family who have lived in the area have all experienced her presence.  I am ashamed to say I haven't experienced what they have all those many years ago.

There are two different stories as to how the The Woman of the Nipomo Mesa came to be.  Here's the first:

Many years ago, when the Nipomo Mesa was an Oil Field, there was a small settlement which had a few houses.  One day, a young woman was walking along the mesa to a meeting place to elope with a young man.  They place they decided to meet up at was by an old rope bridge.  When she got there, she was greeted by a group of men who tried to rape her.  She broke free from their grasp, and tried to run across the bridge, by fell over when a board had snapped and She fell into the slew (Parts of the Mesa were bogs).  She broke her neck and drowned. 

The Bridge had actually existed until a few years before I was born (1988).  The county tore it down to build  homes and roads in the area.  My dad use to walk that bridge everyday when he was a child living on the Mesa, so I know it had existed at one time.

The other story of how she came to be, was she was a passenger on a Train that had taken a turn too fast, and tipped over into the slew.  In the county records, there was indeed a train that had tipped over at the slew, and a few had died.  (I don't know where I could get copies of the county records from my current location in Norfolk, VA to use as verification).

Now on to the Experiences.  I'll start with my Grandfather (My Mom's Dad).

There is a road called Umbrella Road, which was a quarter of a mile away from the Slew where the train had fallen off the tracks. My grandfather had turned off the road and was about to hit the Dip in the road where the slew was, when he was surrounded by ""Saint Elmo's Fire"".  His truck died at the top of the hill, and costed lifeless until it got to the bottom of the dip.  Knowing the stories, and being a skeptic, he hopped out of the truck and started to inspect the engine, when he heard a woman's voice.  I don't remember what he had heard the voice say, but it scared him enough to get back into his truck.  ""The damned thing wouldn't start!""  I remember him telling me when I was a child. ""I heard a tapping sound coming from my window, so I turned and looked, to find The Woman's hand being pressed against the glass and I stopped trying to turn the ignition.""  He paused to light his cigarette and shook his head, ""The engine started itself up.  And without hesitation, I drove like a madman all the way home.""

Here's one from my Grandmother (My Dad's Mom)

At one point in time my grandmother had lived on Umbrella Road, when my father was 12.  She thought she saw something out of her window.  She described it as a woman wearing a white dress from within a glowing fog.  She called my father out from his bedroom to track the woman to find out why she was on the property.  My father got dressed quickly and headed out side, and followed the glowing fog past a tool shed where he saw the Woman disappear into the night, as the fog lifted.

That's all I have for now.  I know I'm forgetting a story.  When I remember it, I'll post it somewhere. Thanks for reading.

We're in the process of replacing our carpet with hardwood which is when everything started. 

First my bedroom's fan turned on by itself. I wasn't there for it but my mom swears she turned both my light and my fan off and when she went back in my room, the fan was on. 

After that I experienced a light in the living room turning on in the middle of the night. I figured my dad just left it on so I turned it off; however my dad told me the light was back on when he got up in the morning for work (this was about a week ago). The light turned on again last night. I couldn't sleep and when I got up at 3 to go to the bathroom it wasn't on but at 5 o'clock it was. The light isn't a dimmer but we have it on a remote control with two other lights--none of the others turn on. We do have a cat but I find it hard to believe he jumps up on the table, steps on only the second button and doesn't move the remote.

So besides all that my mom also said she heard footsteps coming from our dining room but that it may be ""the floor settling.""

The first week I was down here in Arkansas we (my cousin, Alex and I) didn't hear or see anything in his house. We had captured some strange and interesting audio, which some of it is corrupt as I am still trying to fix it, when we went down to the cemetery, I will post it on an audio hosting site if anyone wants, and refers me to a good site to do so. We hadn't seen anything for the first week, it was actually only three or four nights out of that week that we went down there. After that week Alex came back to Oklahoma with me. There aren't any cemeteries within walking distance out where I live, so we just took pictures around and outside my house. We only captured a few orbs. I will post pictures if anyone is interested. After that week I came back to Arkansas again. We had gone back to the cemetery on the 24th of July. That night at the cemetery was one of the craziest nights I have ever had. I should mention that we tried a homemade Ouija board in Alex's room, but nothing happened. When we first got to that cemetery that night it just felt really uneasy and it was as if we were being watched. We heard voices and some whispering, although that gave us chills, that wasn't anything compared to what else happened that night. We decided to walk over to the side of the cemetery we had not been to yet. There are some street lights inside there along the little roads there. We were walking over to one so we could get to the side we hadn't been to. As we came near the road something, that was on the ground, came towards us. It was kind of like a shadow, but it was changing shape and there was absolutely nothing near the light, not bugs at all. We thought that was really odd and scary. After a couple minutes of being over there we had heard something run behind us. We didn't see anything, so we just continued on with the investigation. A few minutes later we had sat down for a while and were taunting them. Calling them a coward. We had decided to head back to where we had done the previous investigations. When we were walking over that way, I had heard something run up behind me so I looked, I saw this big black figure running at us. I told my cousin to run and we both ran away from whatever was chasing us. After a few minutes we were going to try the Ouija again. Nothing happened on the board itself, but he heard talking and saw lights in the trees, we also heard something running around us. I wanted to go back to where something had chased us away, by myself. Alex decided to stay by the board and do it by himself. We decided to be in a call with each other, while recording, and leave our phones on speaker. It worked when we tested it. We hung up so that we could set some candles and in-scents up, like we always did. After everything was setup we called each other again. For some reason that call was really weird. He could hear me perfectly fine, but what I heard through my phone, was something really deep and demonic sounding. Sometimes it would play at the same time as when he was talking and sometimes it would not. Most of the time it would just be at random times and whilst neither of were speaking. We tried it while standing close and while being very far apart. We eventually gave up on me trying to hear him on the call, and instead used it as a one-way for me to communicate to him. I had started going back to where we were chased, I had said, ""Shine the light towards me if you can hear me."" I didn't see him shine the light, so I repeated it a few more times. I saw that he was frantically waving the light around. I wondered what was going on until I saw him coming running towards me. He said that he had seen something moving and then shined the light towards it and saw some eyes, he wasn't sticking around to see what it was. We ended up both going over to the spot where we were previously chased. After about ten minutes before we were inevitably chases off again. I asked Alex if he wanted to go over to where he had seen those eyes, but he didn't want to go back over there so I asked if I could go over there by myself and he stayed by a tree. I was walking over there and I had my phone recording audio and a flashlight. I also had my knife in case it was a opossum or something tried to attack me. I saw something running along the fence. It was one of those metal chain link fences. I shined the light on it to see what it was, but its' eyes were shining too bright to see it. I got spooked when it jumped off so I started running towards Alex and yelled, ""RUN RUN RUN!"" He picked up the bag of stuff and started running too. I had to jump a tombstone that was about four and a half feet tall. The Ouija board had fallen out of the bag. We were forced to start to head back to where we were chased, not once, but twice. As we were heading over there we were chased completely out of the cemetery. Alex was able to get the Ouija board and we just bolted out of there. As soon as we get out we were stopped by a cop, I can't talk about what was really said, but long story short, he had banned us from going back to the cemetery.

Stereotypical, I know.
They were drunk and forced me to let them use my Ouija board. I always thought they were interesting. I had only used it twice with my Aunt, but she's been using them for years, and we only used it in a safe place. A place where many people used Ouija boards. Anyway, back to the story.
I tried to stop them but they insisted and wouldn't let down until I gave it to them. Which was stupid of me. I didn't go into the house with them the second time they went in, I sat out side and waited. The house didn't feel right. When I first walked in the doorway I instantly felt cold. Like the whole house was a freezer. I walked forwards and I felt a spiderweb like texture on my face, only there were no spiderwebs. I decided to get the hell out of there. I tried to convince them to leave but they wouldn't listen, they were too drunk and stupid to listen to my advice. After that I went outside and waited. They were in there for half an hour before I heard a scream. I ran inside. What I saw next horrified me. I have nightmares about it still. Sarah had deep gashes up her legs, arms and her hands and feet were covered in blood. Her body was pale and still and when I looked at her face, she was expressionless. Her eyes a different colour, her lips so very, very light pink. I soon figured out that they had used a cup instead of the eye. I saw the cup between Sarah's legs. It was broken up into four large slivers. Three between her legs, and one still in one of the gashes on her legs. The glass was covered in thick, red blood. Jack told me that Sarah asked stupid and offensive questions and the poltergeist got angry. Well, I'm guessing that it was a poltergeist, due to violent the behavior. It split the cup into pieces and they pieces stabbed Sarah. Then there was claw like marks down her forearms. More hints towards the poltergeist theory. I took the Ouija board outside and burned it straight away. While I was burning it I noticed a glow from the board. It wasn't the fire, it was something else. It was white. I stared at it for a while, before I noticed scratches in the board spelling something. I tried to make it out but I only got a couple of letters. The letters were ""G-T-U-T-N-O-W-R-E-S-E."" I put the pieces together and I soon realized it said "" GET OUT NOW OR ELSE"". I finished watching the board burn with a blank face. I haven't bought a board since that. Jack, Chloe and I dragged Sarah to my aunts house where she stitched her up whilst I told her what happened. Jack told us what happened while I wasn't in the house and my aunt went paler than Sarah had done. Sarah doesn't remember any of it, it's like it never happened for her. She thought she fell out of a tree whilst drunk, which she thought the gashes were. Chloe, Jack and I tried to convince her what happened, but she didn't believe it. My aunt told me to let it go, and she gets all quiet when I talk about it. Sarah didn't actually act like herself after that. She was...different.
She used to go to parties every Friday night, but her mother told me that she had been keeping to herself since then. She stayed in her room for most of the time, apparently talking to herself. I went over to her house three weeks later, and I got the same feeling as I did when I walked into the abandoned house. The cobwebs, the freezing cold wind only this time, I felt something brush past me and stop right in front of my face. I heard breathing, and I felt sick. Sarah didn't notice me walk in, only It did. I backed out slowly and closed the door. I told her mother she was asleep and that I didn't want to disturb her. I went home and burst out in tears. Had I lost one of my best friends? Was I able to ever see her again without It near her? Would It hurt her mother? Her sister or brother? I haven't seen her since. I'e talked to Jack and Chloe about it, and they felt the same thing as I did. They hadn't seen her since they last went over her house. She doesn't come to school anymore, she does home schooling.

Haunted or not?,vodkasasquatch,1,1,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/v6bg3/the_hydro_majestic_haunted_or_not/,"So i went crawling through the internet... Okay i lie. I google searched for information on whatever haunting it was that goes on in the Hydro Majestic. For those who don't know its a hotel that has closed down and been abandoned multiple times only to be reopened again in the Blue Mountains Australia. I couldn't find any information and the information i did find was very brief and uninformative and could hardly be classed as any information at all. So is it really haunted? Does anyone know the story about how it became haunted? Its going to sound silly me asking this because i don't actually believe this stuff happens unless you believe it happens and that in itself causes a piece of your mind on conjure up its own idea and image of a ""ghost"". The irony is (if it can be called irony) that i am a christian. In the bible it says all this stuff exists and not to mess with it at all. This has led me to believe that it only exists if you mess with it. Besides. I like learning about it. Anyway back to my original question, now that you know about the Hydro Majestic Haunting.

1336848345.0,0,self.Ghosts,tjxx8,Ghosts are everywhere I move too. Sucks,,3,3,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/tjxx8/ghosts_are_everywhere_i_move_too_sucks/,"I can start this paranormal journey from being small and laying in my crib as a baby. All the way to now. I'm fifteen and I know what's real and what's not. I as a baby. I'd be in my crib, and i'd feel my crib start rocking by itself. My room had no windows so there was no wind. Being little, it felt normal. Looking back on it now, it had to be something else.

Now it was the summer i turned six years old. I moved to my grandma's house. I now live there again due to money problems. (it's getting better for us). I have always felt something there with me while staying there. I was walking down the through the game room. We had a Fooseball table and the bar spun out of control. My uncle lived with us. He always messed with us and i thought he was being a jerk or something. I checked around he was not there. I nearly shit my pants. I backed away slowly and them took off. I told my parents but they didn't believe me. I don't think they believe me now because of all the other experiences i have now. A few months of living there. My dad went to las vegas. We lived in the upstairs room. My brother and i shared a bed and mom was alone in the other. We then woke up to screaming. We turned on the lamp and my mom was crying. She told us to fall asleep. She didn't tell me what had happened that night til now. I asked her and she said she was dreaming of a women walking through the hall of our house. She walked in the room and and sat down on her side of the bed. She woke up for a brief moment and saw a spot on the bed with an indention. It was as if someone was sitting there. She believes that. But doesn't think i am telling the truth. The rest of the time we lived there was just some voices, and rustling in the walls. Nothing major. I was going into the fifth grade and just moved to a new house. I felt nothing there. No presence or the feeling of eyes on you at all times. It was great. The events that took place were very weird and scary as hell. I was walking up the stairs. Half way up there is a turn on the stairs and then goes the rest of the way. I walk up half way and onto the first step. I see a person standing there for a brief moment. His face was a blur but his whit shirt was dirty with brown splotches of dirt. I stepped back and fell. My eyes teared up for no reason. I wasn't sad I was just surprised and shocked. I told my parents. But no comfort. I then had a similar experience. I saw some one walk into the room to the left of the stairs. On a cold, sad, rainy, day. My brother and parents were gone. I was home alone. I keep my gun on me at all times when home alone. It's an airsoft gun with the orange tip broken off. It looks real. It's really shiny so it looks real. I almost forgot about the events of the other two experiences before. This spawned the memory. I was about 13 at the time. I was sitting on the couch watching a movie. I suddenly hear rustling and footsteps upstairs. I know it wasn't my dogs because both were next to me wimpering. I got up with as much courage as i had. Grabbed the biggest kitchen knife. Put it in my belt line. I slowly walked up stairs. I started yelling random insults. I saw that there were foot prints in the carpet. Those were the only experiences. 
We were in financial trouble going into my freshmen year of highschool. So we move back to my grandmas house. We slept in my uncle's old room. We would wake up with the lights on, our xbox turned on. The TV is static. Anyway, i moved to a different room so i could be more free. I sleep all the way down the hall in the furthest corner of the house. The room across from mine has bad vibes. No one likes that room. No one goes in. The door is always open even after i close it. When ever i wake up to go to the bathroom i see a figure. When i shower now. Steam coats the mirror and i see hand prints bigger than mine..... My family is downstairs making dinner. My mom is down there laughing. They call me down. I walk out and i see my mom turn into the bathroom. I run down the hall and check and there's no one. Vanished. Me in shock i fall sit against the wall. I go and eat my dinner in silence. My family is obviously worried. My mom asked me about it before i went to sleep. She got worried. It happened again. I saw her on the couch. But my real mom was upstairs. My brother is having experiences. He sees a black figure in the corner of his room. Nothing happens. But he just gets frightened stays awake the whole night with his lamp on. I have my uncle's old room and he tells me about his experiences. He says he saw a lady in the closet. He is a fire fighter. He deals with mutilated people, crack heads, and shootings all the time. But he said that that really scared him. When i sleep at night. I see shadows that crawl on the ceiling. Black figures stand next to me while i sleep. I can't move when they are there. I came home one day to find no one home. A note on the table said my parents were at fiesta. ( I live in san antonio. It's a celebration downtown). So the night slowly falls and my fight begins. My brother is at his friends house. I hear voices in the dining room. I am in the kitchen and grab a knife. I run in there ready to kill. But nothing. Nothing but a chair pulled to the middle of the room. I pushed it in and left. I am not scared. I am angry about these things. So i provoke this thing. I run through the house and start yelling at it. I don't think in yelled ""fuck you"" more in my life. I run upstairs to see my room light is turned on and the tv, xbox, lamp, bass amp, and playstation 2 is on. I yelled leave at the top of my lungs. And the suddenly. The feeling of eyes left my spine. The sensation was gone.... For a while. It was about 3 weeks later. I am asleep in the morning and feel tugging on my blankets. I feel it but don't acknowledge it. I plan on waking up swinging my fist at it. But i can't. I am frozen. My eyes won't open. I see myself in my head. There is a big hideous monster next to me. It had my face but it was completely deformed and bloody. Big teeth and drool. That was the only time i felt an evil presence. This was about 3 in the morning. I didn't sleep the rest of the night. I just left my lamp on and played pokemon. I haven't felt anything major lately. My fence opens by itself. The hinges are rusted so it's hard to open. Wind is not able open it. My brother and i just got done playing baseball and the fence swung open fast.

I get use to this stuff and have to pretend it's not real. I don't wanna make my little brother worry. I just try and comfort him. Choose to believe this or not. It's very real.

1329730765.0,0,self.Ghosts,pxmec,Something in my room?,sknewx,3,3,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/pxmec/something_in_my_room/,"Okay so I'm 18 yo (female) and this is a throwaway I just made. I've always been a believer; since I was a child I remember believing in ghosts. Anyways, I tend to scare easily when it comes to things of the paranormal, mainly ghosts, but it's never really been a huge problem. Usually after watching a scary movie I'll be terrified for a few days before I eventually snap out of it and get back to normal. 

Anyways, the part that matters. About April (2011) my grandmother passed away at the age of 93 (almost 94). Anywho, after a couple of months things got settled and I moved into her room. Since I've been in here though, I feel quite uneasy. At first I thought it was just the fact that this was the room of my now dead grandmother, but lately that has nothing to do with it at all. After about 5/6 months I started to feel as if someone/something was in the room with me when I was trying to sleep, just watching me. Of course this terrified me so I began to sleep facing the wall, away from the area that I felt this presence. I also began sleeping with my headphones in my ear, to block out any noises this thing/person might make. Anyways, this obviously made me uneasy and very scared. I told my boyfriend who understands but isn't to much help.

So anyways, one night I was laying in my bed and just thinking/daydreaming, and listening to music. I was very deep in thought to the point where I barely even noticed my music playing. In fact, I couldn't hear a thing. (The song I was listening to was very soft, and my ipod was on repeat.) After about 10/15 minutes, I heard a male voice yell, and I literally mean yell, at me to ""STOP IT"". Nobody else was awake at this hour, and it sounded as if it was right into my ear. Right after this, my music began to play again and I was very aware of everything around me. Again, I was terrified. 

I've never actually done anything (EVPS, EMFS, etc.) but I feel very certain that there is something in this household. I'm quite scared and I would appreciate any help/opinions you could give me.

Also, just a few other details: My sister, who is about 22, has a room downstairs. One night when she was sleeping, she heard a huge bang that awoke her. She brushed it off as something from outside and got up to go to the bathroom. When she came back she flicked on her light to see that all of her stuffed animals that were on top of her headboard, were now sitting neatly and in order on the ground. And I do not necessarily believe that this is relevant, but when I was younger (~8) I had a dream that terrified me even to this day. In the dream my grandmother asked me to run downstairs to grab a carton of milk from the fridge, so I did. I came back upstairs with it but I had accidentally grabbed the wrong one, so she sent me back. For some reason when I got to the bottom of the stairs, instead of going into the kitchen I turned into the living room (which connects to my sisters room, which back then was used for weights). I felt something drawing me towards the room. As I peaked over, I saw a ""ghost"" sitting in the room staring right at me. I felt nothing but utter fear as I knew he wanted to harm me. For some reason instead of running I dropped to the ground and curled up, crying. The man began to walk towards me, and I woke up crying. To this day it still leaves me scared -.-

1329193901.0,0,self.Ghosts,pomo4,The Maxwell House,janepaul,1,1,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/pomo4/the_maxwell_house/,"I have always experienced “supernatural” things and have encountered many different spirits throughout my life. I wanted to share a somewhat recent story from a house I lived in that was built in 1901. 

My parents bought the “Maxwell” house several years ago and it has since been remodeled and restored. I helped with most of the construction and found news papers from the early 20th century, old pots, jewelry boxes etc.... I am unsure of the history of the house, but it has always given me an uncomfortable feeling - like something bad happened there. After moving back to Spokane, WA from London, England, I rented the house from my parents for the last year 2011. My husband lived with me (obviously) and  he also experienced a handful of things, including an unnatural fear of my walk-in closet. This specific story happened around August 2011 when my husband and I had a friend living with us for a couple months.

And now for the classic visual house layout. My husband and I lived in the upstairs of our 2 story 4 bedroom house (including a basement). The upstairs consisted of my office directly to the left of the top of the stairs, continued with our library(which had the walk-in closet my husband fears in it) to the left at the end of the hallway, bathroom in the middle, and our bedroom on the right side of the hallway directly across the library. Our friend’s room was downstairs directly under the library which is the reason the library is the library due to being able to hear EVERYTHING happening upstairs when in our friend’s bedroom. Now let me begin....

It was a long day and I said goodnight to my friend and headed upstairs to sleep. When I was transitioning into dream mode, I heard my phone vibrate receiving a text, but ignored it as not to disrupt my slumber. A couple minutes later (as I would later find out) I woke up to my picture frame falling off the wall by my bedroom door. I figured it was odd considering there was no apparent reason for it to do so, but I just ignored it and checked my text message since I was now wide awake. 

“What are you doing up there? Are you moving boxes?” was what I read from my friend downstairs. I was instantly spooked and called her to clarify. Unfortunately she told me that she heard distinct walking and what sounded like boxes moving, things being picked up and set down again etc... right above her in the library. Apparently she texted me after about 5 minutes to see what I was doing and about 2 minutes after her text the movement stopped. A couple seconds later is when I called her - right after the picture fell. 

There was nothing that could have made the noises my friend heard. I don’t have any animals and we were the only ones in the house at the time. My friend and I went over what happened and tried to come up with an explanation - but all efforts were futile. Before my dad and I added the walk-in closet into the library - the closet was just empty open attic-like space. We found some spice tins and toys in there - but nothing especially odd. But during my year living in that house, it seemed as if most of the activity was centered around that area.

Upon getting it, he gave it to a friend to keep in her purse.  They both forgot about it, but soon after, a mirror in her bathroom broke while on the wall, hearing foot steps, and she reported smelling cigar/fire smoke on multiple occasions.  She gave the lighter to my friend, and he took it home, but also reported smelling smoke, and began having dreams about being injured in a fire(he's a firefighter, so smelling smoke doesn't usually stand out to him).  He knows I collect Zippos, so he wants to give it to me with the warnings.  

So my question is, based on what I observed in movies like *Thirteen Ghosts*, there appear to be written spells that can contain spirits.  I have a glass domed display case, so I was wondering if I could write something on there to contain any evil that may be attached to it?  I plan on giving him one of my vintage lighters in return(I have one with an olde time fire engine on it, and one that has his initial engraved on it), and hope the good will of doing that will help cancel out whatever evil may be attached to the lighter.  But it can't help to protect myself once I get it home.

**Edit:** I am really serious about this.  I have seen/heard people cast protection spells around participants of ghost hunting trips, and was wondering if there was a written version of it.  You can hear for yourself the person who is offering me(by name) the lighter explain what has happened since he got it here starting at around 26:45 in: http://hw.libsyn.com/p/0/3/8/0389fbd9ef66335a/stevedave-87.mp3 ",,False,self,t5_2r1q4,True,,,True,t3_m9vpq,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/m9vpq/are_there_written_spells_to_contain_a_possible/,

I couldn't escape it and it killed me. I don't remember how, but I clearly remember the transition of being alive to being dead. I was a spirit in a blue mist form and the sensation was much more intense than my dreams normally are. I know my sleeping patterns very well as I have been to a neurologist and have been checked over to ensure all is well. They found nothing wrong with me. Ever since, for weeks at a time I feel this being from my dream following me. Its presence is heavy and filled with anticipation. I feel it watching me and I scour rooms before I settle down to make sure there's nothing there or nothing that could be mistaken for this thing. The figure was part human and part what I can only describe as mole or rodent like and super emaciated in a black robe. This has been driving me up a wall for over a year and I've been through all the proper medical channels (neurologist, psychiatrist, psychologist) and all they can find is that I have mild OCD and some anxiety, but nothing to cause me to see or feel these things. Last night was the final straw as I heard something calling my name. I was awake and tried to respond, but it seemed to disappear down the hall outside my bedroom. I was woken up several times like this. I used to dabble in Ouija and similar practices and do believe that most of these cases have a scientific evidence, but I wanted another opinion. I'm starting to get really worried because my typical behaviors have been changing and sometimes I go into a weird state and come out of it doing something I never planned to do. Other related information is that my house is on grounds where Native Americans used to reside and my neighbors have unmarked human graves right beside my property line from when the house was built. Any advice or opinions would be super appreciated. I'm tempted to go back to doctors because I feel so crazy, but would like to know if there's anything I can do to help myself.",,False,self,t5_2r1q4,False,,,True,t3_jl0gu,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/jl0gu/need_help_could_this_be_a_spiritual_presence/,

Our location was based out of hockey rink in our home town, which had a few banquet halls. On my very first day of work, when we were cleaning up after a christmas party, I was told to  load up a cart with ustensils and plates to bring them down the freigh elevator, to the storage room everything was kept in. This particular elevator, could only be opened by a special key, in which there was only one of. as I approached it, it opened, seamingly on its own. Rationalizing, I figured someone was downstairs and had sent it up. The door closed before I had gotten in, and had gone back down. Using my key, I sent it back up to me, and pushed the cart in. Being the first time in an elevator like this, I was already creeped out. It was cold, drafty and had padded sheet like things on each wall. As the door opened, and I started pushing my cart out. Two forks from the top of my cart, flung and hit the stone wall, about 12 feet in front of me. Terrified, I immeadiately pushed the cart out, and pressed the button to go back up to the kitchen. My sister noticed the distress on my face, and asked what had happened. Blurting out that some magnetic force had thrown forks, she simply said  ""oh, you met Joe"". ""Joe"" was apparently a worker in the rink, back when It had only been a rink. His wife had cheated on him, and he eventually hung himself from the rafters above the ice. His presence can only be felt in the older parts on the building.

From that point on, workers in the building would come to me telling me their own stories of joe. A zambonie driver was once on foot on the ice, cleaning up, when he felt a push, sliding him a few feet accross the ice, only for a flood light from above to come crashing down behind him, where he was just standing. A mural of a lion had been painted by the locker rooms in the rink,they had to pain over it, people were complaining that the eyes were moving, and photographic evidence of this could be seen in the trophy case located in the rink when unintentional photos of kids with their medals and banners had been taken by the mural. sometimes the eyes were lookin left, looking forward or looking right. The venetian blinds in our main banquet hall, looked onto the mezanine of the indoor pool, and one particular window, no matter how many times you closed them, the second you turned around, they were open again, I experienced this many times, frustrating when you're hosting a wedding, and wet kids are peering into the window. The blinds were eventually replaced with a pull down shade, that was fastened with screws to never open up, it had to be refastened every few days. We also had a canteen in the bingo hall, and I can't tell you how many times, it seemed as if something was blocking the door to get in, even though the door was unlocked. The knob, door and entire door frame were replaced multiple times in the few years I worked there. It's now a physio clinic, where a friend of mine works. The old canteen is now a storage closet, where they still have to replace the door, because they cannot explain why It always seems as if something, or someone is blocking the door.

What do you actually plan to do when you catch a ghost?  Would you be morally OK with the ghost being entrapped, and perhaps experimented upon?  Is that even possible?

Some people are morally against hunting animals.  Is there any moral ambiguity around hunting ghosts, which could arguably have more free will than an animal?

What if it turned out you could communicate with the ghost?  What would you want to ask it?

NB: I made a somewhat snarky comment along these lines to one of your members (in another subreddit).  But then I realized I'm actually interested in these questions in a sincere way.

Transparent 4ft tall floating off floor 2ft. The shape, look like a person with a sheet over head. Except the transparent part, a slight white glow and floating off the floor. I was sleeping upstairs with my brother. I'm at on end of the room in my bed. My brother at the other end of the room in his bed. The ghost was near my brothers bed. I just open my eyes, and there it was facing me. I mean it look like it was looking right at me. I stood still, didn't move or said a word. I just stare at it. Then it seem to move, turning to its side. Moving across the room paralleled from my brothers bed, away from me. As soon it reach the stair rail. It kneel down, at this point I can't see the ghost. Because the stair rail is solid with wooded paneling. At this time, I heard like someone was crawling on the floor. It sound like knees crawling on the wooded floor. I can see at the end of the stair rail casing. Waiting for ghost to appear on the other side. Well the sound fainted away like crawling away from a distance. Never seen the ghost appear at the end of stair rail casing. The sound of knees knocking on the wooding floor quit. I couldn't sleep after that. So I waited for the sun to come up. And ran down stairs to my parents bedroom. And told them I saw a real ghost upstairs, last night. Of course they didn't believe me. But, I know what I saw. I never saw the ghost or seen any ghost activate to this day. But, my whole family has experience ghost activate at the house, after my experience with one. They never seen the ghost like I did. But, here's what happen as time past. The first time with the ghost again was with my Mom. She was in the attic upstairs, cleaning/organizing the attic. Well she was bented over to pick up a box. When a pebble(small rock), hit her on the back of the head. At that time, she thought it was one of the kids. Even though this was a school day and dad is a work. After she yelled, about getting hit in the head with a small rock. Look around no one was there. She step out of the attic no one was around. She yell, downstairs no response from no one. She then went downstairs, thinking one of us was home. At this time, she realize she was home alone. At that time she was scared. Knowing someone hit her in the head with a pebble(small rock) and there weren't anybody at the house. She didn't went back up stairs. She waited for someone to get home. Told us what happen, that's when I said the ghost must of done it. Well that day just blew over, like any other day. Like that day I really seen the ghost. One day we did some remodeling around the house. Tearing down some walls. Found a little girl shoe, a small tea cup, and old newspapers. The weird part, some of the 2x4's was scotch/charcoaled. Indicating was a fire at one time. Even some of the rafters upstairs had signs of a fire at one time. At that time my curiosity rises. I went to the library looking at some microfilm of old newspapers. Using the date of the old newspapers I found inside the wall. I might of look at 7 dated newspapers. When I came across a headline about a fire in the 1600 block of the street I lived on. It was a fire that a little girl at the age of 10 died upstairs at the home. Chills went down my back, after I read that. I told my parents and my brothers this. A few years past. My dad and my 3 brothers and a friend of one of my brothers were in the kitchen. Just talking/yakking at each other, at the kitchen table. Then all of the sudden, every cereal box(9). That was on top of the refrigerator. Flew across the room, hitting against the kitchen cabinets. And fell to the floor. No one was hit by the cereal boxes. No one was even near the refrigerator and everybody was sitting down. So some of them jump out of there chairs then stared at each other. Wondering what just happen. That's when my dad said, it must been the ghost. The friend that was in the kitchen. Just got up and ran out of the house and went home. So my whole family has experience with this ghost. My parents still live in the same house. And the ghost, which we know is that little girl that die upstairs, is still around.",,False,self,t5_2r1q4,False,,,True,t3_169qtp,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/169qtp/believing_is_seeing/,

I'd like to, but I don't. I'm not even entirely convinced you're real. I'm an uncompromising skeptic and, as such, I don't believe my girlfriend (now wife) and I saw a ghost while lost in the dark in Venice in January 1999. I enjoy the story though, so I thought I'd share it.

I was 20. We were in Venice in the winter (not recommended). If you've been to Venice you'll have seen how labyrinthine it is. Now imagine that out of season with NO people around, in the dark, with no street lighting. We got lost and were mildy worried. Every damn turn ended being a dead end. After about half an hour of this, it wasn't clear how long it was going to take to get out of there.

Suddenly we rounded a corner, and there was a lone streetlamp. I don't want to exaggerate, it wasn't in the middle of nowhere. There was some light nearby so we could have been finding our way out anyway. It did seem out of place though.

Beneath the streetlamp was a young teenage girl, dressed in what looked to us like some kind of red school uniform. Relieved, we went to speak to her. My wife speaks Spanish, and was able to understand enough Italian to get directions out of the maze and back to the train station area. She was a really sweet, helpful young girl. We thanked her and soon found our way out.

It wasn't until a little later on that it hit us how odd the meeting was. How out of place she was. To us it looked like she could have been the only person in a 500m radius or more. Waiting for something under a streetlamp. There was nothing to wait for. It just didn't really add up and still doesn't. At the very least she seemed very vulnerable, but did not appear at all scared.

Far from conclusive of anything but a girl wearing red, but we've joked ever since that she was a helpful ghost.",,False,self,t5_2r1q4,False,,,True,t3_vbtvk,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/vbtvk/total_skeptic_but_this_happened_in_venice_in_1999/,

I thought it was my brother so I told him to get the fuck out of my room. Thinking it was my brother I went to swat at his leg. I end up putting a decent amount of force in the hit and falling right through. I look up to see who it is and it's a sort of white silhouette with almost a sort of hoodie shaped outline with no visible face. Shocked I sat there, then the figure started drifting back. I had a curtain over my doorway because I had no real door, the figure then phased out through the curtain without creating even a ripple or any movement in the curtain.

We got there ate played xbox. We had a fun time, but then it started to turn dark. Of course my friend said, ""Lets ghost hunt."" My friend house was proven haunted but he decided we mess with the ghosts. We turned off every light and started recording. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTkcSAoMPWI&amp;feature=BFa&amp;list=UL8sbNGLKci2M first video

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sbNGLKci2M&amp;feature=BFa&amp;list=ULyTkcSAoMPWI second video.



We got those two and got freaked out because the steps started to rumble (right after video). Not as in a loud rumble ,like if someone was running up and down the stairs. We look up and of course nothings there. At around 3 A.M. we decide to walk around doing EVP scans. (Electronic Voice Phenomenon) We started to hear the ghost speak and where so terrified we went to sleep only to find all my friends xbox games 
on the floor. I left soon after. This is the story of what happened that night.

Now, a little background. I am a skeptic of any kind of ghost/paranormal happenings.Yet, My grandparents are very in tune with their “6th sense”, ever since I can remember. They always try to get my cousins and I got go talk to sprits with them, they say it runs in our blood being able to see sprits, but I've never seen one. Their house is right next to a cemetery built in the 1790’s, and burials still take place today. The cemetery surrounds the back of the house and more isolated graves are toward the garden. 
	So last summer I arrived, greeted as usual by my grandpa but my grandma was no where to be seen. I wandered up to her room and heard her yelling, “You’ll leave her alone! You are not welcome here!” It was weird to me, but she’s always talking to spirits.  My grandma and I always take walks, and she tells me about the deceased people she talks to, but lately she said a new entity has been contacting her, scaring her and grandpa. (Really, I love my grandparents to death, but I can’t believe any of this stuff, or so I thought...) At this point I play along and ask my grandma what the scary entity looks like. She describes a tall dark man in a black hat, she says he never lingers for long. 
	Fast forward to my last day with them, I was in the kitchen helping grandma with lunch when she starts to get nervous, I can tell she’s trying to hide something from me but I can’t tell what it is. I shrugged it off, and continued peeling potatoes. I get this cold feeling, like ice pressed on my teeth and back and it spreads to the rest of my body. I look up, from the kitchen you can see out to the garden.

I believe that I have been targeted by at least one sex demon. Over the past year I have felt as if I have been watched outside my house while on my late night smoke breaks and the feeling is the worse after midnight. I have been hearing shit walk near me, and have felt at least one, if not multiple entities. A few times I have felt invisible tendrils trailing away from my body, which I know is a sign of psychic vampirism. Over the past few months I have started to hear several voices calling my name over and over again. Last night I was physically contacted. I was smoking a cigarette around 1am when I started hearing the voices again and could hear and feel things walking around me. This time they were far more distinct and then I actually heard something tell me  ""[They] were sex demons and would give me a wild ride"".  I convinced myself I was just hearing shit, as it was quite windy, but within a minute I felt as if a presence had entered my body and something was pleasuring me from the inside. All my motor functions seem to cease and this continued. Suddenly I snapped out of my ""revery"" and felt completely normal but then realized that at least 30 minutes had passed, and I could no longer feel any presence near me.
I have never felt their presence inside my house before, we have 3 cats and that may be scaring them off. I live with my parents and my brother and sister. Only my sister and I have heard any indication of paranormal activity and my brother just tells me I'm hearing shit.
The entities don't seem to wish me any harm, but I am not sure what course of action I should take, if any. I do want to protect my family and my concern is that they may be using me to develop their powers for a further purpose. Is it safe to investigate further or should I contact a professional? I don't have any money and I can't be open about this with my parents as they will probably think I'm becoming a schizophrenic.
