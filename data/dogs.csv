okay i just spoke with one of the volunteers, she said the dogs were  beyond filthy, horrible. it was some person's idea of a puppy mill. This animal shelter can only handle 35 dogs, they have 350. so all the help that comes to them is needed. Bless all of you for getting the  word out. Keep it up, they still need help, donations, and a lot of dogs need to be adopted...thank you for posting so many of the donation sites..

Chained to the same dilapidated barn he'd been chained to for the last year. He was skinny, he was filthy, he was covered in ticks and fleas and flies and sores. He was blind in one eye. The obvious victim of neglect and abuse. He was five years old and looked fifteen. He was terrified. I crept to him slowly, he wouldn't even look at me. He started to drool from fear. I hated to push him, but I had to do something. So I left. 

I came back with supplies. Large tweezers, flea shampoo, flea drops, towels, ointment, a brush, a giant bone and a bag of treats. He stood so scared, but so patient, while I plucked, scrubbed, rinsed, brushed, and treated his wounds. I talked to him softly and fed him treats. I was never afraid. Some dogs will bite from fear, but not this one, I just knew it. Once I finally finished, he still looked like hell. 

The next day, I brought my dog to meet him. Just over a year old and jumpy as a cricket, I didn't know if he could handle her. He did. Not only did he handle her, I saw a glimmer of light in his one good eye. So he came home. 

I had no idea what I was going to to with this dog. He was broken. He didn't know his name, I could barely touch him, and he flinched at the slightest movement. A larger movement would send him skittering away with his tailed tucked. 

People thought I was crazy. ""No one wants a broken dog"", they said, ""put the poor guy out of his misery"". They couldn't see what I saw though. There was a tiny, sad, soul in this great big dog that wanted so desperately to love and be loved, to trust and be trusted. 

So I set about training him. Can you sit? Nope. Down? Nuh uh. Come when called? No way in hell. Ok then, we'll start from the beginning. Eleventy million treats later, he learned his name. Then he learned how to come when called and a few other things. It took hours and hours, months and months. 

Somewhere during that, he learned I could be trusted. If the jumpy girl dog(who he was now a constant shadow to)loved me, I probably wasn't so bad. I spent countless hours, sitting near him on the floor, tossing treats, just being there. Occasionally I could scratch his head without him flinching. The first time he voluntarily jumped on a couch to lay near me, I cried. I think he took one last chance to love again, and he spent it on me. 

Today, to the average person, he is still a broken dog. He's not that old, but looks older. The sores healed, but they left scars. His damaged eye has been removed. He has warts. He farts a lot. He's gone from skinny, to quite round. It was discovered he has a blood clotting disorder. He doesn't greet people at the door with a smile. He doesn't greet them at all. He doesn't like to be the center of attention. He doesn't play fetch or tug or anything at all. He always thinks its thirty degrees warmer than it really is, so he pants the loudest pant I have ever heard and drools like crazy if the temp gets above sixty. He still can't sit on command(we're still working on it. One day…)He isn't afraid of strangers anymore, but he is still shy.  

But he's beautiful and perfect to me. He greets me by bouncing a mere inch and a half up on his front legs. He gets to wagging his crooked tail too hard and turns himself in a shaky circle when he knows we're going for a walk. His one eye nearly bugs right out of his head when he's presented with a treat. When you give him a good neck, back, or butt scratch, he sticks his neck out and kicks his back foot. He asks for my attention by coming up to me and leaning on my leg. Never pushy, never a whine, never a stare, just a weighty reminder that he is right there, and I could pet him if I wanted to. He snores like a damn grizzly and barks in his sleep. When he wants the jumpy girl dog to play, he flops on his back and squirms around, inviting her to bite his belly and wrestle. 

He is broken, but he is mine. I promised him that he will never know another day of pain. He will always have enough food. He will always have a cozy place to rest his weary bones. I will always have enough time to talk to him, cuddle with him, give him plenty of scratches. If he lives two more years or ten more years, those years will be spent with me as blissfully as I can manage. I don't care if he never learns to sit. I don't care about his farts, his medical needs, or if he ever chases a ball. He is free to be whatever he wants to be. If he remains broken in some ways, that's ok. I love my broken dog.

I feel I should address this specifically.,ktbird7,600,91,135,http://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1bx5l4/re_no_kill_shelters_i_feel_i_should_address_this/,"This comment has been upvoted quite a bit in another thread, and as someone who is intricately involved in this, I feel the need to address it specifically and point out where it is incorrect.

&gt;No-kill shelters simply turn away animals, kill shelters at least give them a chance because it's a simple fact that there are far more homeless animals than there are homes available. And as for ""adoption organizations"" many of them simply browse the spca and dog kennel shelters and scoop up the cutest and most adoptable dogs for around $50-70 then resell them as a ""rehoming fee"" for 200-300 and write up some bs story of how the dog was moments from being put down. It's a scam.

Breaking apart by pieces:
&gt;No-kill shelters simply turn away animals, kill shelters at least give them a chance

Wrong. There are two types of no kill shelters, open admission and closed admission. Closed admission do turn away animals, and while each is different in terms of care and selection criteria, often times animals do get impeccable care at these facilities. I volunteered at one regularly for three years and adopted an animal from one. I witnessed them do a double hip replacement surgery on a dog that needed it. Many, not all, take very excellent care of their animals, better than what many shelters can do.

Secondly, not all kill shelters give animals ""a chance"". At the kill shelter I work with most frequently, about 1/2 of the animals are never sent to the adoption floor. They are killed as soon as the stray waiting period is over and never even seen by anyone but the shelter staff.

&gt;because it's a simple fact that there are far more homeless animals than there are homes available

Wrong again. There are more homes looking to add an animal each year than there are animals being killed each year. It is a marketing and public perception problem, not a numbers problem.

&gt;And as for ""adoption organizations"" many of them simply browse the spca and dog kennel shelters and scoop up the cutest and most adoptable dogs for around $50-70 then resell them as a ""rehoming fee"" for 200-300 and write up some bs story of how the dog was moments from being put down.

Wrong again. I am a leader and board member for a rescue. We pull dogs from the kill list, sometimes as soon as 8 minutes before they are put down. We pull dogs that are hard cases. Many have behavior problems, and we send them to a trainer to work through them before putting them up for adoption. We have many dogs that are dog aggressive and work to adopt them out only dog homes, or to homes with dogs that they do get along with.

Further, the average cost to treat an animal after pulling them is around $250. Our $150 adoption fee often loses us money, and considering around half of our animals will be adopted out at a discounted rate, we are losing even more. Donations and grants make up where we lack.

&gt;It's a scam.

No, it's saving lives, and continuing to write it off as a scam is the reason people are hesitant to support our organizations and more likely to go to a breeder.

You cannot group all shelters and rescues as one. We are all different.

Most importantly, and I cannot stress this enough...
**There are open admission no kill shelters. I live 10 minutes from one in Rockwall, Texas. Do your research before spreading these lies.**

It is time that we, as animal lovers, stop being complacent with our governments killing adoptable animals. It's deplorable, and please ask yourself why you shouldn't be angry about this. Get out there, volunteer, foster, and network the animals at risk in your community.

We can be a no kill nation but everyone needs to pitch in and do your part.

Thanks for reading this far, dog lovers.

This is a picture of Buster. My family's 10 month old bulldog. He was the funniest, best dog anyone could ever hope for.

On Sunday, August 26th, 2012 at about 11 am Buster was brought to PetCo in Algonquin, IL for grooming. He was a stinky farm dog so he needed a bath and nail trim. We didn't think anything of the event as it was routine. In prior appts he had left a happy, clean pup with no problems at all. 

Shortly after putting Buster in PetCo's care, they called with awful news. Buster was dead. The story from PetCo - the groomer walked away to get him some water, came back, and he was dead. Totally natural, happens all the time, right? No further explanations have been given. PetCo has also refused to even speak on the matter as advised by their corporate office. 

Devastated and searching for answers, we had an autopsy performed. The results show that Buster died from lack of oxygen due to strangulation. Our beloved dog now dead because of PetCo's negligence.

My main intention of this post is to educate as many people as possible on this tragedy. What better way to accomplish that than Reddit. It's not the first time something like this has happened. There are dozens of cases of animals dying in the care of groomers. Not just PetCo, but most big corporations.

In medical emergencies, dogs should be taken to the veterinarian as soon as possible - Reddit cannot help, and home remedies aren't going to work. So in the interest of education, I've compiled a list of symptoms of medical emergencies in dogs. Please read and remember these symptoms. If your dog is exhibiting any of them, **TAKE HIM TO A VET IMMEDIATELY.** Do NOT take the time to ask about it on Reddit, because minutes can make the difference between life and death.

**CANINE MEDICAL EMERGENCIES:**

-Respiratory difficulty (heavy panting, inability to breathe, etc.)

-Swelling around the face or neck

-Excessive vomiting

-Seizures

-Any type of head injury or loss of consciousness

-Pale or blue gums (for dogs with pigmented gums, check under the eyelid)

-Hives on the face or all over the body

-Medication overdose, chocolate or chewing gum ingestion, or accidental toxin/medication exposure

-Collapse, inability to walk, or non-weight-bearing limbs

-Actively bleeding wounds (apply pressure if possible)

-Different sized pupils, or abnormal pupil behavior

-Any type of eye injury

-Inability to urinate

-Body temperature outside the range of 99-104F

-Bloated abdomen or dry heaving

-Birthing difficulties or retained placenta

-Heat stroke

-Vaginal discharge or excessive licking in unspayed females


**CANINE NON-CRITICAL SYMPTOMS THAT NEED TO BE EVALUATED BY A VETERINARIAN:**

-Diarrhea

-Blood in the urine, or difficult/painful urination (try to collect a fresh urine sample for your veterinarian)

-Abnormal gait or balance problems (critical in case of trauma, seizures, or head injury)

-Vomiting

-Lethargy

-Abnormal increase or decrease in appetite, thirst, or urination

-Scratching, scooting or hair loss

-Bites and fight wounds (potentially critical if large, grossly contaminated or actively bleeding)

-Worms in stool or vomit

-Abnormal behavior

-Growths and lumps

-Coughing, excessive sneezing, or discharge from the eyes or nose

-Rapid changes in weight or body condition

-This is not an exhaustive list; call your veterinarian if you are in doubt of anything abnormal.

Let me know if I've left anything important out. Remember, if in doubt, it is safest to call a veterinarian, even if you have to call a 24-hour veterinarian in a different state. They are more knowledgeable and more reliable than the internet, and calling is free. You know your pet the best, and if you feel like something is wrong, it probably is. Most major cities will have at least one 24-hour veterinary hospital. They are easy to find on Google. Also, to Redditors responding to posts asking for medical advice: remember, it is ILLEGAL to give specific medical advice outside of a doctor-client relationship.

Please upvote this so people can learn this stuff. It would be nice if this information made its way onto the sidebar or submission guidelines too. Hopefully this will convince a few more people to bring their dogs to the vet instead of seeking advice here when it may be too late.",,False,,t5_2qhhk,1344196437.0,,,True,t3_xllbp,http://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/xllbp/how_to_recognize_a_dog_emergency/,

[Let me tell you about this fucking dog.](http://i.imgur.com/0AMHShd.jpg)

His name is Tuco. He’s a purebred Brittany. He’s five months old.

And he’s going to have to live to thirty to make up for all the shit he put us through in his youth.

When he was three months old, he was left with a dogsitter for a few days. There he developed a sudden case of much-bigger-dog-to-the-face. He was blinded in his right eye and may eventually need to have it removed.

It was upsetting, but ultimately turned out fine. He has no idea it ever happened and is a perfectly normal, obnoxious puppy.

And then last night, he was bitten by a rattlesnake.

My dad and I were walking him along a trail just outside our neighborhood that we have often traversed. Dad was telling me about how he had seen a rattlesnake the day before, for the first time in thirteen years of living in this hellhole some people call Las Vegas.

We let Tuco off leash, because he’s well-trained and we were trying to tire him out before bed.

Like an asshole, I said, “Go find some rattlesnakes, Tuco.”

And ten seconds later, that little fuckface *did*.

I saw a flash of movement and heard him yelp. In ten more seconds, I was checking him for bites while my dad swore at a snake. If you look at the picture above (and I won’t blame you if you don’t scroll back up, it’s not pretty) you’ll see two gaping holes where Tuco was presumably shanked in the face. At the time, they were neat little punctures, which were considerably less disgusting but infinitely more horrifying in the moment.

We rushed home (although not before my dad murdered the shit out of that snake). I tried fruitlessly to entice him to drink while my dad located the nearest emergency vet. He started to shake and drool, and I told him what a good boy he was, because when you think your dog’s dead meat, *you fucking tell him he’s a good boy.*

Finally my dad emerged with a phone number and address, and we rushed to the vet. It couldn’t have taken more than twenty minutes, but I’m not sure how my dad found the willpower to stop at red lights. I thought I was going to go insane when he made a wrong turn that cost us about two minutes.

When we got in, his face had puffed up some, but to nowhere near the extent depicted above, and he actually seemed to have improved. The vet techs shuffled in and out of our room with paperwork and repetitive questions. I was finally starting to feel a little better as my dad read statistics from his phone about pets bitten by rattlesnakes. Apparently, about 95% survived. Tuco was young and strong; his odds were good.

Then the vet told us he had a 40% chance of survival.

Of course, they made us wait for “thirty minutes” (read: over an hour) first. I spent that time cracking weak jokes, pointing out the nearby Mexican restaurant that I’d heard was good, being unimpressed with *Time* magazine, contemplating whether or not I should just start opening doors until I found my dog, trying not to sob hysterically, sobbing hysterically, and using up the vets’ supply of tissues. (They didn’t stand a chance against my dual-pronged attack of grief and allergies. Trees know me as “the Slayer.”)

Having spent over an hour alternating between being sure my dog would live and making plans for the funeral, I don’t think I have to tell you how I felt. The vets kept him overnight, assuring us that they would do all they could, although “the prognosis [was] guarded.” We drove home in silence.

It would have been my turn to take him for the night. I stared at the crate that sat empty in my room, thinking I would do anything to be stumbling out the backdoor to watch him piss.

The next morning, my dad took him to our regular vet as directed. That vet said Tuco would have a gross face for a while and then be totally fine.

Well. With that news, I rolled over in bed and did my damnedest to induce a coma. (I failed, crashed in the middle of the day, and am now high on sleepiness.) I saw him today and he was acting like a puppy with a weird face. That was more excitement than I needed, ever. But he lived, so I’ll take it.

I guess the moral of the story is that there are rattlesnakes sometimes and you should avoid them. Also, apparently they have a rattlesnake venom vaccine now. Why did nobody think to mention this until it was useless to me?

We got her from the pound when she was around a year old and she immediately was attached to us at the hip. At times she was obnoxious and incredibly needy but she never lacked loyalty. When she died yesterday we'd had her for almost 4 years, so I was surprised to hear about it. 

When I got home things went from bad to worse. I went downstairs to take care of her body only to find drops of blood all over, leading from the outside through the doggie door to where she died. After finding the blood I checked her body and found a small puncture wound in her side. I did some more checking around outside and found blood drops in the street in front of our house and in our driveway. 

At this point we decided to take her body to the vet to find out what happened because she clearly didn't die from natural causes. After an x-ray we were told she'd been shot with a pellet gun that had punctured her lung and ultimately killed her. 

This morning I picked her body up from the vet and buried her. It was one of the hardest things I've ever done. She was honestly the sweetest dog in the world. We also have a chihuahua and they were the best of friends, which makes losing her even worse. He seems incredibly sad and unresponsive. 

Just wanted to vent about this whole process. I'm a fucking mess. I've cried at least every hour since I got home yesterday at 2:30. I miss her immensely and can't imagine why anyone would do such an awful thing. 

[This is a fairly recent picture of her.](http://i.imgur.com/Z47Sbyz.jpg?1)  


EDIT: Wow, thank you all so much for your encouragement, advice and kind words.

I've seen several comments about how this could have just been a freak accident and I want to think that's what happened. That it was some punk ass kid trying to be funny or something and that one in however many hundreds chance of that pellet hitting the perfect (or I guess the opposite of perfect) spot happened for whatever reason. Either way, fuck that kid. 

I've knocked on countless doors and spoke to countless neighbors. No one has seen anything. 

Also, several people have mentioned if she was consistently roaming the neighborhood. She was not. We have a fenced backyard that she dug out of on Wednesday. ",,False,,t5_2qhhk,1370619104.0,,,True,t3_1ft7ae,http://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1ft7ae/im_at_a_loss/,

It turns out she has an inflamed salivary gland. The medicine needed was only $10 and she should be fine within a week.

Just giving her 1 dose completely changed her. She has so much life now! 

Me and my girlfriend were close to discussing what we would have to do if she had cancer. I told her I would do everything I could.

So happy I don't have to worry about that anymore.

I tried my best to fix up the gate and put both my bins in front of it, thinking I have the weekend off to fix it, it should hold.

Today, Im at work. I get a call. Your dog got out again. (first thought, Son of a bitch dog). I thank the old man for his help, as he says he has locked up the gate and put the dog back.

I get home ready to fix the gate and find the old man has fixed it for me. He replaced the broken board and nailed it shut as you would your window, avoiding a zombie attack, problem solved. Note, he did a better job than I could have imagined.

I know the old guy doesn't frequent Reddit but none the less I sincerely appreciate his efforts and wanted to share his kindness with you.

This website was very useful when I looked up [chocolate toxicity in dogs.](http://netpet.batw.net/articles/choc.tox.html)



Next I called the vet. She said he needed to vomit, and told me how to induce it.  **Step 1.**  5 mL of hydrogen peroxide (1 mL per 5lbs) syringed down his throat.  **Step 2.** Crackers (i had peanut butter ritz, that's what he got) **Step 3** Exercise. 


We went on a walk and it didn't take him too long to start throwing up.  There was a lot of chocolate there.  Now he is napping and he is fine.  Watching his temperature and heart-rate, if either increase, I think we will still need to go to the vet.  I hope this information is never of any use to you, (because who wants their dog to be poisoned?); but if you need it, I hope it helps.

When I got out of the car to see what was the matter she stood up and I saw that she had a terrible, open wound on her right hip and that her right rear leg hung lifelessly as she dragged it behind her. I couldn't tell the exact extent of her injuries, but it looked pretty bad. She was also extremely skinny.

I already had one dog sick with congestive heart failure, and really wasn't thinking about getting another dog, nor were we really prepared for more vet bills, but I just couldn't *not* help her, so we got her to the vet and I told them to do whatever was necessary and that we would assume all financial responsibility.

When the vet called the next day they told us that she had been shot. They also told us that her right rear leg, which had atrophied to the point that it looked like a leather flap with bones in it, would probably need to be amputated and said she had about a five percent chance of ever being able to use it again at all.

Well, a little over a year later Penny still has all four legs. She has a little pain with it from time to time, but other than that, she is fine, both physically and psychologically. She is a very happy dog, intelligent, playful, affectionate and always eager to learn new things. In short, she is probably the best dog that has ever owned me. 
Oh, she also gets to go to work with me every day and will be starting agility training this Winter. We've already been doing some informal agility training.

We wouldn't have even seen her except that she peeked out of the bushes with her little copper-colored head. She will also carry the bullet fragments in her butt for the rest of her days, so we decided to name her [(Lucky) Penny Leadbottom.](http://imgur.com/a/bZfYC)",,False,,t5_2qhhk,1352640895.0,,,True,t3_12zvxm,http://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/12zvxm/for_my_cake_day_i_present_my_rescued_border/,

Ridiculous!",ThrowawayGSD,436,91,550,http://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/16nr55/no_fencedin_yard_no_dog_ridiculous/,"I've had a dog for 38 of the 41 years of my life and decided to get another to replace my mutt that passed last year.  I spent the entire fall trying to rescue a dog and was rejected at every point, so I ended up getting a pup from Craigslist in December.  Why?  No, it had nothing to do with the outrageous costs - I can afford them (though I doubt most people want to spend $375-$500 on a mutt), it was another policy.
  
  
It was because I didn't have a fenced-in yard.  I attempted to contact 11 different rescues over the course of three months and here were my results:  
  
  
Three of them refused to answer any questions by email or phone until I filled out the adoption application for the dog I was interested in.  Even questions like ""how old is the dog listed?"" considering the age wasn't on the listing, just ""adult"".  Is that 3 or 8?  Even questions like ""is the dog crate trained?"" or ""is the dog housebroken?"" which weren't on the listing.  This is a completely asinine policy.  Either put the damned information on the listing, or answer questions.  I'm not going to fill out an 8! page adoption form to find out how old a dog is!
  
  
The other 8 rescues rejected my application immediately because I answered that I did not have a fenced-in yard.  
  
  
None of the rescues asked about the situation.  None of them followed up beyond ""we do not rescue dogs for people unless they have fences"".  
  
  
None of them asked about my yard, a 120-acre piece of property with no neighbors, 85 acres of woods, three streams, two enormous meadows, and a small pond - clearly a horrible environment for a dog.  Even when I entered the above information on the application next to the fence question, did it help?  Nope, instead, I was flatly rejected and ended up going to Craigslist to get a dog who may or may not have been from a puppy mill, backyard breeder or whatever other scourge the breeders hypocritcally rail against, while driving people to them at the same time.
  
  
There is a real issue with dog rescues in this country, and I'm not the only person to notice.  Fees, 8 page applications, home visits, 4 day interview processes, 6 week application processes, and asinine, inflexible policies like the fence policy are going to send people elsewhere, like all of the places the rescues so desperately hate.  
  
  
EDIT:  For all of the rescue people blaming me, below is an actual e-mail I sent to a rescue that told me they answer no questions about dogs prior to me filling out an application.

  About a week ago I brought out the space heater because my family room is pretty cold but I don't feel it's cold enough to warrant turning on the heat to the entire house. When I brought it out Sonny sniffed it cautiously and accepted it without a problem. It's been on and off for at least a week with him paying any attention to it, which is why his behavior last night was so strange. 

   So, last night I was curled up on the couch alternating between watching TV, surfing Reddit (obviously, right), and playing with Sonny. We were cuddling on the couch when he got up and started pacing the room, whining every couple of steps. He started circling the space heater. ""Leave it alone, Sonny. It's just the heater."" He sat down and stared at me. ""Sonny, come back to the couch."" He stands up and circles the heater once more before he begins barking at it. Obviously annoyed, I get up to show him that the heater isn't going to eat him. That's when the smell hits me: THE SPACE HEATER IS OVER HEATING! I quickly pick it up and realize that the heater is turned up to the max, something I never do because its a very old space heater and can't handle being cranked all the way up. I turn the heat down and unplug it, just to be safe. I turn to Sonny, who is just standing there wagging his tail, and give him the biggest hug ever, accompanied by a bunch of treats! I can't believe I didn't realize I was in danger of burning the house down, I was in my own little world. The smell was even strong enough to reach to my parent's room; my dad actually told me to go check on the furnace.

  I felt like sharing this because my family doesn't seem to understand the significance, they think I'm biased by my love for Sonny. But I know better. :) I didn't think I could love him anymore, but he definitely proved me wrong!!

Also un-neutered males and un-spayed females can play TOGETHER sometimes WITHOUT SUPERVISION. 

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE when you go to take your dog to a daycare/boarding facility always take a tour first and ask them these main questions:

* Do you require vaccines? Which ones? (Should be AT LEAST a bordetella, distemper, and rabies)
* Do you let un-neutered/spayed dogs to participate in group play?
* Are there any breed restrictions?
* What is your policy if your dog is injured or injured another dog?
* How far away is the closest vet?
* How late does the staff stay? Is there 24/7 supervision?
* How do you mix dogs? Do large dogs and small dogs play together?
* How much playtime do they get?
* Do you temperament test all dogs and mix compatible temperaments?

In the album it also has pictures with detailed captions. Please PM or comment if you have any more questions about reputable doggy daycares. Don't get scammed!

1372341779.0,332,self.dogs,1h6fik,Just watched the FedEx delivery guy kick my dog in the face. Is there anything I can do?,bbeatz1,410,78,182,http://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1h6fik/just_watched_the_fedex_delivery_guy_kick_my_dog/,"I watched the whole thing from my kitchen window. My dog got up from his nap to trot out into my driveway and start barking. I saw Clyde, a 2 year old Golden Retriever, sitting out in the middle of my yard barking as the Fedex guy was walking back to his truck. Clyde wasn't making any movements towards the delivery guy or anything, just barking at the stranger in his yard. FedEx guy stops, turns around once getting back to his truck and moves towards Clyde which prompts him to start wagging his tail only to be met with a boot to the mouth. I was appalled. I understand that dogs can sometimes be a threat to a delivery guy, but he was already back at his truck and Clyde wasn't; advancing towards him at all or showing any aggressive behavior except barking periodically. **CLARIFICATION** I called Clyde back inside, which he obeyed, when I first heard him barking. I do so in a manner that the delivery man could hear and he acknowledged by turning his head towards me. When the delivery man was back in his truck, I let go of Clyde because I thought he was going to leave, but instead when he saw Clyde sitting in the yard he left the safety of his truck to come back INTO my yard to harm my dog. 

Is there anything I can do about this? I don't imagine there is but it really stunned and disgusted me. I went out and yelled at him and he threw some bad language my way. I'm sure I'm not the first person to experience this but I would really like to file a complaint even though I know it wouldn't do much good

UPDATE: I've made a post to their facebook page and have been making several calls to the FedEx offices and am waiting to hear back on any progress. On a sidenote, I'd like everyone on here to respect my privacy in regards to my facebook post. Please do not try to contact me or anybody I am linked to on there. I've already had people contact my employer by piecing together my description in comments and my post history. To me, thats a huge violation of my privacy and made me feel rather uncomfortable. I will post any updates to come. Thanks for your support and compliance to my requests. And to everyone saying that they'd be in jail, I was too preoccupied giving my dog a lookover to make sure his jaw/teeth weren't broken as he wimpered and cowered his way back to me. I could barely yell some choice words back at him before he was on his way down the street. Easier said than done, but I'd rather ensure the health of my dog than get petty revenge when I know that I could get this guy fired instead. Go give her dogs a treat, some love, and a nice long walk. They sure deserve it.

**UPDATE2**: Made more calls to the FedEx chain of command, my report has been filed and they're acting on it. They know who it was and are going to consider their options and decide on the appropriate punishment. Their Facebook team has contacted me and that helped with getting my report seriously considered, so Curtis, thank you for your help and cooperation. That being said, I saw the same delivery man deliver a package to my neighbor this morning. My father was home today, as I have a follow up appointment from a recent surgery scheduled this afternoon that he is going to go with me too, and we had another chat with this guy. Voices were raised, choice words were thrown, but in the end I think we settled it the best we could. His side of the story was different than mine, which was what I expected. He said he never came back into my yard and he did it in self-defense which is what I'm sure he told his superiors after they contacted him about the incident. It's his word against mine, but I hope the publicity that this has gained has made them at least think about changing their policies. Anyways, I brought Clyde out to meet him and gave the delivery man a treat to give him and urged him to give him some pets. In typical Clyde fashion, he trotted up to him tail a-wagging and immediately rolled over for some belly rubs and gave the delivery man's hand a few licks. Hopefully settling the matter in this manner changed his thought process a bit, seeing as the ""vicious"" dog that he was so terrified of yesterday was now on his back giving affection like only Clyde knows how. His voice was full of remorse and I could tell that he knew he offended my family, so I'm just hoping that this was an unfortunate one-time occurrence and that his views on dogs have changed.

My wife &amp; I were hanging out on the couch of our small apartment watching TV when he went into 'hunting mode'.  It's not uncommon, and always entertaining, but it's also usually reserved for mice and crickets. 

However, tonight he was under my desk and rather determined to get at something.  As his hunting buddy I was clearing crap way to see what he was getting at, and thought it strange that he was pointing at the outlet my computer's plugged into.  Upon further inspection I noticed that the outlet was very hot and was turning those fun shades of brown! 

When I pulled the first plug, sparks started shooting and I very quickly trying to remember how to put out an electrical fire.  Luckily, they died down on their own, albeit at the cost of permanently melting the extension cord in the other socket. After that little adventure I stopped fucking with it and flipped the breaker for that room and called the landlord. Electrician's due anytime now. 

We started having strange electrical issues about a month ago, but were never able to pin it down. There's no telling how long it would have gone if the Dog wouldn't have found it for us.  Judging by the degree of cooking around the outlet, it wouldn't have been long before a fire broke out.  

Moral of the story: Dogs are awesome, and were bred for something sometime, and you should listen to them when they're trying to tell you something.

He was left by his previous owner on the side of I-95. Murphy came into my life and left his paw prints on my heart. He was such a loving and caring dog. He followed me all around and never left my side. As someone who is self employed, I sometimes work from home quite often. Murphy was always there next to me helping me throughout each and every day. 

Murphy has had heart condition since I got him, a slight murmur but was on medication and has done quite well. Over the years, Murphy has led dog walks and has always loved to go for car rides.

On Saturday night, Murphy was having trouble breathing so I took him to the emergency vet. He had water in his lungs and was given a shot and diuretic to clear it up. Around 1:55 AM on Sunday morning, Murphy's fight ended with him dying in my arms. He was a great friend, and a very loving dog. I am devastated knowing that he's gone. 

I love you and I miss you Murphy, thank you for 8 wonderful years.

EDIT 9:30 PM:

I posted this before I left for work today. I just got back in and I'm overwhelmed with the responses. Thank you so much to everyone. I am so distraught over this as Murphy was my rock. He was my best friend. I really miss him and can't go a minute without thinking about him.

I wanted to share another story...

We picked Murphy up from the emergency vet clinic on Monday morning because we just weren't happy with them. They were all about money, showed barely any sympathy and even though they said they wouldn't charge for the cremation after they first said we'd need to ""square up our bill"" before they ""send it off"" for cremation. I decided I didn't want him there the whole week until they ""sent him off"" so I brought him to my local vet, who has a contract with a local funeral home and he would be picked up immediately.

Anyway, when we picked him up he was in a cardboard casket. One of the most heart wrenching things I have seen. We picked him up and brought him to his vet and got to see him one last time. The staff at my vet was amazing - they allowed us to see him one more time and I got to pet his head once more.

While sitting in the room, my girlfriend and I noticed a picture on the wall that I had seen there every time I came but always forgot to ask about. We asked if we could buy it and our vet gave it to us. It was a painting that was purchased in a store, but looked exactly like Murphy.

Here it is: http://i.imgur.com/dPGW4wwl.jpg

I have it hung up and stare at it every day. I miss this little guy so incredibly much. This is painful and sometimes I just cry uncontrollably.

I also have a stuffed dog that has hung around with me for many years that my girlfriend put Murphy's sweater on. The sweater smells like Murphy and having this by my side while I watch TV or I'm working in my office is very nice for me.

Here it is: http://i.imgur.com/MkUHHB7l.jpg

I know this may seem silly to some, but it's very soothing to me.

Going back in time, I nearly begged my parents for him when I was in high school. He was our first indoor dog, a miniature pinscher. He became part of our family soon enough and we loved him. My mother decided to move after my father passed away though. So, he rode with my brother for 10 hours into Southern Missouri while I was stuck driving the uhaul with our devil of a cat.

We finally arrived at a hotel in the city we were moving to. My brother,  I, and Milo chilled out for a day or two waiting for my mother to arrive.  Playing with him, doing nothing, followed by taking Milo for a piss. This was the routine for a day or two.

Well, we decided to check out the new house while my mother was away. We started looking around and moving our belongings from the uhaul into the house while letting Milo play in the fenced in backyard. We decided to grab some lunch and we had two options. Either leave him in the dark garage(no electricity yet) or leave him in the fenced in backyard(suburbs). Well, I thought it'd be cruel to leave him in the dark garage considering he is wimpy. So, I let him chill out in the backyard. We went for lunch and when we came back, he was gone. It turned out when we drove away, he panicked, being in a new place, and dug under the fence to find us. We were pretty devastated.

We put up fliers, got a lashing from my mother, and the usual routine. We were in a city of 9,000 people. It was October. There was traffic and the cold at night to worry about. A tiny black short haired dog makes for an easy target for death.

It put a downer on moving into the new house. We just changed our home of 24 years and started off by losing our dog of 6 years.

It went on this way for about 2 weeks until I gave up hope and started talking about buying another dog. I hated not having his companionship. I started telling my mother about different breeds but her and my brother were resistant. My ignorant brother was still putting faith into finding our dog. But, to me, he was either long gone, hit by a car, or got sick from the cold and died by that point. But, my mother and my brother continued to search everywhere including the hotel. No such luck.

No hope and 3 weeks in.

It was October 31st. We got a call about them spotting a dog similiar to ours in the flier near a liqour store. We went there, and he said the dog was very timid so he couldn't catch him. We showed him a picture of Milo, and sure enough, it was him. We called him out and as soon as he heard my mothers voice his skinny body ran for her. He peed himself with joy all the way back to our home in my mothers SUV.

The liqour store was about 100 yards across some railroad tracks from that hotel. He waited for us there for 3 weeks.

tl;dr: Our dog traveled 2 miles in a new city trying to find us at a hotel we stayed at when we first arrived. Traveled across a 4 lane high way and many busy streets in October. The cold rain and wind persisted. And yet, he waited for us there for 3 weeks.

Damn do I hate myself for it.

Two days ago was just another day. Yesterday morning he began having seizures. Turns out he had cancer in his brain. Just hours later I had to make the decision to put him to sleep. I'll miss that little guy. I keep wishing I had known something was wrong so I could have dedicated more time to him in his last days. Make the most of your time. Never know when things might change. I'll always love this guy.

[One of the first pictures of me and Sam](http://i.imgur.com/Qg9VnbV)

[Last of us, moments before he passed](http://i.imgur.com/B3Vbl6P)


If you don't mind, I'll share a few of my favorite stories of him. Probably more for my benefit than anyone else's.

1) Sammy was the most affectionate attention-whore I've ever known. Absolutely loved people. If he wasn't being touched or petted, he'd force his head into your hand, or rest it on your knee, or grumble until you noticed him. If I was gaming or watching a movie, he [had to at least have a paw on me](http://imgur.com/yZ1qs7h) if not be [sprawled across my lap](http://imgur.com/ddKqX). My favorite is that he would curl up under my arm every night or even fall asleep lying on me while I napped on the couch. 

2) Sammy fancied himself to be a great hunter and did catch the occasional squirrel or bird. One summer night there was a rabbit hanging out in the front yard of my apartment building. Sam spotted him, but couldn't catch it as he was on a leash. Every night for the rest of the summer when we went outside, he would crouch into a slow hunting stalk as we approached the yard in the hopes of sneaking up on the rabbit, who usually wasn't there anymore. It was hilarious.

3) One time I had an idea to increase Sam's exercise he got from walks. I'd put one of those weighted doggy vests on him so he'd have to haul a few extra pounds around with him. Maybe it would slow him down, too, since he never quite got the hang of walking at the same pace as me. I put it on him, unweighted at first to accustom him to the feel, and started moving to the door. We didn't make it 5 feet. He hated the feel and wouldn't walk. The next morning I decided to put it on him before I went to work so he'd have all day to grow used to the feel and we could progress from there. I put it on him and he sat down, clearly disliking his situation. I returned from work 8-9 hours later and that dog hadn't moved all day. Still sitting in the same spot. We never tried that again. You won that one, buddy.

Thanks for reading if you do. Just need to get some of this out for therapeutic reasons. I still wish I had more time with him. He was a great dog.",,False,,t5_2qhhk,1365379940.0,,,True,t3_1asvgc,http://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1asvgc/farewell_sam/,

The girl's parents took her to be examined at a hospital. Her skin wasn't even broken but the hospital staff are mandatory reporters and were forced to call animal control. 

The animal welfare society has argued that Phineas is NOT a threat. The Lexus Project, a legal group determined to save dogs wrongfully labeled as vicious, is helping but we need to bring more attention to the situation. 

Please take a moment to visit the site below. Examine the facts that are put forth and make your own conclusion. If you see that Phineas doesn't deserve to die please sign the petition on the site.


From the site:
On June 22, 2012, a Golden Lab named Phineas was seized from his home and family in Salem MO following a report that he had bitten an eight year old neighbor who had entered his yard. A photo of the bite indicates that it was hardly a nip and did not even break the skin.
The family of Phineas retained an attorney and brought action against the City of Salem to have Phineas returned to them. From the time of his seizure and for nine months, Phineas was confined in doggie jail. Written testimony from the boarding facility caring for him and submitted to the City states that he was anything but vicious.
On March 22, 2013, Phineas was removed by Animal Control to an undisclosed location following issuance of an order by Judge Scott Bernstein of the Dent County Circuit Court. In that order, he stated: ""The Court finds that Phineas, the Labrador Retriever owned by the Plaintiffs is in fact a vicious dog as defined by Defendant's City Code under Section 5-15 in that Phineas without provocation on June 22nd, 2012 bit (minor child - name withheld.) The dog shall be humanely euthanized.""

No shock there. The shock was he didn't come home that night as he usually does. We called Animal Control and gave a description of the dog and warned them not to try and catch, just call us and we'll get him. He won't bite, but cannot be caught. ""yea, right. Whatever..."" was the reply.

3 days later we go to the pound as we had been every day to check, and a dog catcher hears us describe him.
""THAT dog?? I chased him all day. What kind of dog can run over 30mph AND jump an 8 foot fence??? I was just about to go try again as we got a call that he's trapped in a high school football field.""

So I follow the dog catcher out and look in the closed gate of the field. 12 foot high chain link- he has truly pinned himself in, the groundskeeper closed the gate before calling the pound.

I can see him relaxing in some hedges on the far side. Yup, that's my dog. NOTE: He is a boxer-lab mix with brindle coat. He looks like an oversized pit bull and people fear him based on the false stereotype of pits.

I open the gate and enter. The groundskeeper is nervous. ""he looks vicious. What if that's not your dog?""

Dog is understandably skittish, being chased for days. He bristles and growls as he circles to stay away. Calling to him gets a curious tilt, but not enough to identify me in this fairly noisy and echoing place across a football field.

So I circle the other way to leave a scent trail, then sit down in the middle of the field to wait.

he finally circles to my scent trail, sniffs, then lays his ears back and STREAKS toward me barking like a madman. The gardener starts screaming ""OMG OMG OMG!"" and then he hits me, bowls me over into a tangle of dog and man.... where he begins attempting to remove my skin by licking and whining pitifully. Scaredy dog finally found his safe place.

I loaded him in the car, and the dog catcher came over to meet this escape artist. As he was with me this time, old Houdini sat and enjoyed the petting from the man that had chased him all over the city.",,False,,t5_2qhhk,False,,,True,t3_1brb3j,http://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1brb3j/a_dog_story_someone_suggested_i_show_you_guys/,

A very good friend of mine has been deployed in Afghanistan for the past year with a team of 12 people. They befriended a stray dog named Sheba who sought them out as companions. She even went out on missions and guarded the camp. She had 7 puppies in March and 5 of the soldiers would like to adopt the pups and the mom. It'll cost $4,000 per dog to ship back from their camp to JFK as it's quite the journey and will not be covered by the Army. They're currently working with Nowzad dogs in Kabul and Save-A-Pet Animal Rescue on Long Island to help give the dogs a home. You can read about the pups' story here and donate: https://fundrazr.com/campaigns/8ZNLd


If you would like to donate, that would be amazing! Every little bit really does help. If not, sharing and spreading the word elsewhere can do a lot of good to help get these dogs a home here in the States. Once the dogs make it back to New York, I'll be posting an update with pictures! :) Much thanks Reddit!

What I didn't know was that the door was open to the room and the room is full of people.  Max sees all the people in the seminar and takes off into the room.  He's running around from person to person, up on his hind legs looking for attention. 

The lead speaker stops talking and there I am at the door of this giant conference room calling him to come back....which he doesn't.  So there I am in my PJ's running around the conference room chasing Max. Max by now thinks this is a fun game so he books it every time I come near him.....i am apologizing the whole time for interrupting their seminar. 

Everyone starts laughing and the lead speaker says that this was a first.  I finally talk him into coming to the front door by coaxing him with treats.  I think he made their day.

Edit2: It is legal to shoot a dog on your own property if you advice the owner in advance that you intend to do  so. He didn´t and when i picked him up he just said that he was sorry and that he really had thought it was a fox. He knew the dog himself, my dog has said hello to him numerous times.

It wasn't a picture. It was a two foot by three foot high-res POSTER of her saying. ""Adopt me! 2 yrs old, let me melt your heart.""

It wasn't just her, it was at least 15+ pets all kinds from the shelter lining the walls. 

This is a RESTAURANT. These people are taking money out of their pockets and business so they can help save animals and give them wonderful homes. They also have a donation box where they collect money for the shelter. It really touched my heart and I want to spread the word about this business.

Please read this.,bmlbytes,422,147,236,http://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/10nrjp/cant_afford_your_vet_fees_please_read_this/,"Every day I come on here, and there is always someone requesting medical help for their dog. They explain that they can not afford the vet visits, and so they need advice from Reddit. Something about this makes my blood boil. If you truly can not afford the vet, why are you taking care of a dog?

So here's the deal. There is no excuse for not taking your dog to the vet when it is sick, injured, or infested with bugs. You took on the responsibility of caring for that animal, and you likely even signed a legal contract with the adoption center/breeder/etc stating that you would take care of all medical needs. You have an obligation to that dog to take care of it.

Now I understand financial issues happen. I am recently unemployed and am running a bit thin on money myself. However, I know that whatever happens, I can take care of my dog. I have prepared myself in case of an emergency. 

So what can you do to help with the medical costs?

* 1. Put some money in a separate bank account. Use this money ONLY in the case of medical emergency.
* 2. Have a credit card on hand. You don't have to use it, you just need it nearby in case you need to pay for medical costs. 
* 3. Get pet insurance. It is really not that expensive, and could help a lot in case of a medical emergency.
* 4. Get a pet line of credit. Companies like [CareCredit](http://www.carecredit.com/vetmed/) will give you a credit card to use only at the vet. They wont even work anywhere other than your vet.
* 5. Ask friends and family for help. If you can't afford it yourself, borrow money from your family and friends. 
* 6. Find someone else who can take proper care of your dog. If you can't afford treatment, you are not being fair to your dog.

Your dog deserves to be healthy. Please take your dog to the vet when needed. Reddit is not a veterinary clinic.

Thank you for taking care of your pets.

EDIT: Some good advice on wellness plans, an alternative to pet insurance.
&gt;An alternative to pet insurance is a monthly wellness plan with a vet. If you're in the US near a PetSmart, check to see if there's a Banfield Animal Hospital inside--Banfield and PetSmart teamed up and share facilities in a lot of newer PetSmarts. I have a wellness plan with Banfield for my dog, and it's saved me over a thousand dollars in the past year. You pay a monthly fee of about $30, and in return, you get free vet visits, free vaccines, discounts on a lot of other services...a week after I rescued my dog, I discovered she had giardia and a stomach parasite, needed a tumor removed and had to have a few teeth pulled because her mouth was in such bad shape. With the wellness plan, all of that was about half the cost of what it would have been otherwise.

EDIT: More good advice from another comment.
&gt;And ask your vet about a repayment plan! Not every vet is going to do this, but it's always worth a try, especially if you're a long-time client.

I feel like the worst doggie parent EVER.

Saturday evening, I was munching on some trail mix.  I dislike raisins so was picking around them.  Normally I save them for bunny/chinchilla treats, but [Diesel](http://i.imgur.com/FL6SX.jpg) was begging as he normally does when people food is involved so I started tossing the raisins for him.  He loves to catch stuff midair so I was tossing them way up.  My husband chuckled, and for whatever reason decided to google whether or not it was OK for dogs to have raisins.  It is NOT.  I called doggie poisen control who advised me that a 50 lb dog was probably ok with the 10 raisins, but to induce vomiting, so we poured a few tablespoons of hydrogen peroxide down his throat and within 1/2 hour he'd vomited up the raisins.  I slept downstairs with him and he never displayed any signs of illness, but I was mortified with myself and scared for him.  I'm so grateful my husband googled it.  

I did initially call the emergency vet, but they refused to let me bring him in unless we contacted the doggie poison control first and got a case number.  Not happy with that requirement but I guess $40 for the call is cheaper then a trip to the emergency vet.

Much research later, I did find out that 10 raisins is well below the threshold for danger for a dog Diesels size, but the fact remains that grapes and raisins are a huge unknown with dogs.  Some get very ill on a small amount, and some don't seem effected by them.  Always better to err on the side of caution.  Raisin will be strictly for the bunny and chinny going foward!",,False,,t5_2qhhk,False,,,True,t3_1cv06a,http://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1cv06a/warning_raisins_and_dogs_are_a_bad_combo_ie_i/,

",HundRetter,319,52,117,http://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/189v2u/inside_account_of_what_goes_on_at_a_bad_no_kill/,"Once upon a time (last week) I worked at the SPCA of Southwest Michigan. I was ""head of staff"" and there for a little over a year and a half. And during my time there I got to see all sorts of appalling things, but mostly some really cool dogs were euthanized that didn't deserve it, and the operations manager was more than happy to impede any option for a happy ending for them so she could euthanize them. There is plenty of neglect, illegal activities, and just plain icky things I could talk about, and will at a later date, but there is a really cool dog on the line again so it's time to speak out.

http://imgur.com/ItnRB0x 

That dude is Buddy. He is an unruly gleeful fellow with no manners. Anyhow, since the SPCA does no adoption process other than if you have the cash you get the dog, Buddy was adopted out once for a short time, returned, and then adopted out THE SAME DAY he returned to another family, and then returned again a few days later. The adoption counselors spend little to absolutely no time in the kennel, so they know nothing about the dogs they adopt out. One would think if the first family who returned him had a complaint about Buddy, he would not be flipped over to the next family as fast as possible without exploring that issue, but the next family had $300 and that's how the SPCA rolls.

After Buddy's return, he has been sitting in the quarantine kennel for about 3 weeks now. There is no paper work on his kennel, nothing to speak of. The red euth flag went up when manager Katie asked me if I had any trouble with him, like taking him outside, because ""other people"" were. She always asks this before a dog dies. Buddy is a puppy in a barely year old dog's body. He is very mouthy, but no malice in that dog. He also spends at least 23 hours inside his kennel with no attention and nothing to do, put out into a tiny concrete yard for 5 minutes here and there. Recently staff was issued a note regarding how we are not behaviorists and therefore cannot assess dogs. Since no on does assess the dogs, and as someone who spends an incredible amount of time involved in dogs (and now work for a facility where I DO assess and work with dogs) I can tell you that there is nothing aggressive about Buddy, nor is he a dog that is any sort of liability. Put that guy in a place where people ACTUALLY care about him, get him his exercise, and teach him impulse control and you've got a fine dog. I started working on Choice games and impulse control with Buddy in the small amount of time I was there in my last week and he stopped putting his mouth on me in games AND stopped mouthing his leash. This is the only training that was done with him. I texted my coworker and asked that she let me know if she hears any thing about Buddy, since I already had a nagging feeling. She asked Katie at the staff meeting what was going on with Buddy and Katie said he was going to be euthanized next week. When she asked if she could take him, she was told no, and I am familiar with that as well. After having painfully tried to negotiate the release of other dogs (after finding them facilities and offering to pay out of pocket) and seeing them die anyway, I knew I had to act bigger and harder this time.

Buddy's REAL issue is that he ended up at the SPCA. Buddy is definitely not the first dog to die without just cause, and unless I can bring attention to the bullshit that goes on there he won't be the last. I put out a plea on FB on Friday and it was subsequently shared over 50 times and MANY people e-mailed/called the facility. The operations manager Katie only returned the initial e-mails upon the break and has since stopped replying to others. Now the story she gives is that a behaviorist (we don't have one) assesses all dogs before these decisions are made (not true) and that Buddy was NEVER going to be euthanized and no one would ever say that. She can either admit she lied for whatever sick reason you would lie and say you were going to euthanize a dog, or she can admit that assessments and training there are all an elaborate charade and she was going to euthanize Buddy without any word to any one.. Just like I had to discover most of the dogs that died were dead. Sending them to animal controls is the most common, so that there are not more euth statistics on the ""no kill"" shelter's record.

Now I'm asking people to stay on this and not let the attention die or Buddy will die quietly with no one to dispute their bullshit. If you are interested in joining his fight, help us continue calling and e-mailing asking for the name and credentials of this so called behaviorist AND video evidence of this supposed assessment that is going to happen. There is no reason not to give either with a dog's life on the line.


Phone: 269.344.1474

Board of directors email, they supposedly ""don't make euth decisions"" or know about them: board@spcaswmich.org

The sorry excuse of an operations manager that makes these mindless decisions: operations@spcaswmich.org


Thanks for reading. Any ideas are welcome and I am more than willing to talk about every thing I know. I have been given contacts for local media outlets and have been emailing them as well. I have photos and videos of the neglectful conditions the dogs are left in by employees, photos and accounts of the other dogs that were euthanized, emails reporting concerns to the board that were dismissed, and text messages from Katie I would be willing to share. There is nothing good about this organization, other than most of the volunteers that try to make it better. That's why I stayed for so long, but I cannot continue losing dogs from inside the system and fighting in their bubble where it doesn't work. They are scared of the media and they are scared of people speaking out. They will be motivated by not looking bad, when they should be motivated by helping animals.

1346859775.0,250,self.dogs,zeb8a,Big dog? Small dog? Medium dog? Dog at all? PLEASE TRAIN IT PROPERLY. ,doryfishie,364,114,157,http://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/zeb8a/big_dog_small_dog_medium_dog_dog_at_all_please/,"Coming from someone who has a 73lb lab mix, and a 9lb dachshund pup, and fostered dogs of virtually every size--it does not matter the breed of your dog.  

-Proper socialization  
-Training of basic commands  
-Walking on leash when appropriate  
-unless you show/breed, neutering/spaying your dog 

These are ALL things EVERY dog owner should do regardless of the breed you own. It never is the dog, it usually is the owner. I've seen angelic Chihuahuas and demonic Golden Retrievers, terrible Mastiffs and Heinz57 mutts who were absolutely perfect. Any dog can be great, any dog can be terrible. Don't assume anything about someone else's dog other than the behavior you are seeing. One bad dog of one breed does not condemn that entire breed. Just because one dachshund bit you doesn't mean they're all terrible. Just because pit bulls have a bad rap doesn't mean you freak out and pick up your tiny dog. Just because YOU think YOUR big dog is a 'good dog' does not mean you let him run off leash and annoy other people and their dogs who are on leash.
If you're like me and you have a big AND small dog you get the worst of both sides. People run from my lab mix because they think she's scary (I have seen grown men do this and she was just sitting next to me, trying to snag my ice cream cone). People yell at my dachshund because they think all small dogs are bad and small dog owners don't train. When a Mastiff who was off leash decided to charge my dachshund, and she barked once at him to tell him to stop, the Mastiff owner yelled at ME. Excuse me but your big off leash dog charging my little on leash one? She's going to be scared. Think about what you would feel like if something 4 times your height ran at you suddenly. 
Both my girls, big and small, have been in obedience school constantly. My lab is a therapy dog and we are training the dachshund to be one as well when she is old enough. Sorry for the rant but I am so tired of this 'big dog/little dog' nonsense. Every breed has its lovers and haters, that's the wonderful thing about dogs.  

TL;DR: Doesn't matter what breed you own. Train it right, socialize it and use the freaking leash when you're supposed to. Your 'oh bichons/dachshunds/chihuahuas/insert small breed here aren't real dogs' machismo or your 'big dogs are scary ahhh' nonsense is quite frankly silly. Dogs are dogs are dogs, do right by them no matter what.

The dogs appear to have been poisoned but our local law enforcement doesn't seem to think it's important enough to investigate. We need to get this sick individual off the streets. Bastrop County Sheriff tends to look the other way when it comes to animal cruelty. The animal shelter director was accused of neglecting shelter animals and making them live in filth and the Sheriff did nothing about the complaints received from over 40 shelter volunteers. The director was only removed after she was arrested for a DUI. http://www.kxan.com/dpp/news/local/bastrop/volunteers-allowed-back-at-bastrop-animal-shelter

Here is more info from the owner of Chazak, one of the murdered dogs. She's asking people to call the sheriff and demand something be done.

(PSA on how to catch a bolting dog),,297,51,78,http://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/15r9mu/special_thanks_to_an_anonymous_redditor_psa_on/,"I can't find the post to thank you personally, but you have my gratitude!  The timing of this was incredible.

I saw a post yesterday about bolting dogs; the user recommended that rather than following the dog, letting it think you're playing chase, you run the opposite direction so the dogs follows.

Earlier today, my brand new foster--a Great Dane/Pit, the most vigorous puller I've ever met--had her leash detach from her collar while she was trying to find a barking dog.  She took off running down the sidewalk in the opposite direction.  I quickly ran the other direction, while calling her, and she instantly turned around and ran back towards me.  I was able to secure her leash again and my heart stop pounding.

So, thank you anonymous redditor!  I've had this happen before with a dog bolting out of the front door, twice, and both times I chased him halfway around the neighborhood in my pajamas before carrying his delinquent ass home.  This little trick works like a charm--everyone who has a dog that can outrun them should know this!

We were walking out to the parking lot when I heard a dog alternately whimpering and barking.


I didn't see any dog around (it was in an area where there are lots of different shops and restaurants, some of which have patios. We got out to our car and when I looked over I saw a little Jack Russell Terrier-looking dog looking out the window.


He was making a lot of noise, scratching at the window, and panting heavily. It was about 83 degrees outside, and I don't even want to know the temperature inside of the car.

I went inside and told the maitre d' there was a dog locked in a car.


His response?

&gt; So?


I told him that I would appreciate if they would find the owners, there were only maybe 12 people in the restaurant, including those on the *dog friendly patio*


He told me he wasn't going to do that.


I asked him if he had a better idea, and he said I should mind my own business. I asked to see the manager.


The restaurant manager was much more sympathetic and they went and found the owners: an older couple mid-50's I'd guess. They were pissy because they'd been eating lunch on the patio and saw me go up to their car.


They asked me what was wrong and I told them their dog shouldn't be in their car with all the windows rolled up on a hot day. Why not just leave the dog at home? Or, I don't know, take it on the dog friendly patio?


They said the dog always begged for food and it annoyed them. They also said ""He wanted to go for a ride and if we left the windows down while we ate he could get out.""


After a few minutes of back and forth I told them I had no problems with calling animal control and letting them sort out the issue. 

They said they'd take the dog and tie him to the fencing by the patio but he was NOT eating lunch with them. The manager said he'd bring out a bowl of water for him, and the couple refused.


At that point I left. The dog was being let out of the car and that was the important thing. 


My mom and brother told me I was overreacting and I should have minded my business. I wasn't rude to them, I was definitely curt to them, but that's just my personality. 


I handled the situation as best as I knew how. People just frustrate me.",,False,,t5_2qhhk,False,,,True,t3_1jrzs9,http://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1jrzs9/dogs_in_cars_rant/,

I have two dogs, a black lab that's one year old and a pitbull puppy that's six months. My dogs sleep outside in the doghouse but last night I woke up to them barking really loud and I was about to check on them when they suddenly stopped. I thought nothing of it and I went back to sleep. That's the most horrible decision I've ever made in my life. When I woke up this morning to go feed them I couldn't find my black lab. I thought he was hiding at first because the pit was there but after searching the whole yard he was nowhere to be found.

I think somebody stole him or let him loose somehow. I walked all over the neighborhood but can't find a trace of him. There's no way he gout out by himself, the fence is too high and the gates where closed. The only conclusion I can come to is that they stole him.

I don't know what to do. Please help me. I live in the city in a cul-de-sac so we never get any traffic. That makes me think it could've been a neighbor and that's a horrible thing to think.

How do I get him back? I dont know what to do and I'm so scared of letting the puppy out of my sight. He only has a collar and isnt registered so Im scared he might end up getting murdered in a pound.

EDIT: I'm in the Los Angeles area and yes I have been checking CL but nothing's up so far. I'm in the process of looking up all the animal shelters within a ten mile radius of me on google so we'lll see how that goes. I hope I can find him before anything bad happens.

EDIT 2: I found my dog. I was driving around my neighborhood this afternoon and found him in a random street not too far from me. Some asshole ran him over and dragged him to the side of the road. He was dead. I don't know how that happened or why someone would do that instead of getting help. I can't stop freaking out about it and keep alternating between crying and getting really pissed off.

In my first week I encountered a gal in the quarantine kennel: http://imgur.com/OhM3bvo

I can remember the very first time I approached her she let out a scream and tried desperately to climb the kennel walls to get away from me. She was completely shut down otherwise, but would try to get away in fear if any one approached her. Over the next five months nothing was done with her. She was heartworm positive, unaltered, and had given birth to a litter of puppies that had since been sold. I heard various things, like she was supposedly going to a sanctuary, but there she sat. Towards the end of her stay there she was approaching the bars and allowing staff to scratch her through the kennel door and let her in and out willingly. Needless to say, I was shocked when I was told she was going to be euthanized November 17th, 2011. 

November 17th, 2011 she came home with me instead. I was required to sign a ""waiver"" and adopt her despite my offer to foster her to be adopted. They would not be putting any money into her and it was either go or be euthanized. I was told ""She's feral. She'll never be adoptable."" 

For the first two weeks or so she sat far away and looked at me like this:http://imgur.com/PGv7noS 

She was afraid of dog beds, afraid of toys, afraid of me. Her health was imperative so she was treated for heartworm (and declared negative last July), spayed, and vaccinated. Feral, she was not, and it was quickly evident whatever had happened to her wasn't going to leave a lasting impression. This are some moments from our last year and a half together: http://imgur.com/zMO50Yk,4eVoW4d,wfeCisp,G4LgS9h,Qedyz0N,lLbDzn3,5sdb4OX,FPqw4LT,4ofkf9F,XUn85qG,ndtivtX,hirVcSw

Now, two weeks from today, Elsa goes to her forever home. I have never been so happy or sad in my life. I'm thankful to Elsa because now I can share her story. I am not Pamela Dennison. I'm no Patricia McConnell, either. Dogs are beautiful, resilient creatures. Elsa was written off and to be euthanized when she just needed the time and patience to find her way. Now she's your average dog and someone wanted her. I have met opposition to this. The same questions, why the time and money on this dog? You could have saved dozens. I've always personally believed every dog deserves a shot and if the resource is available, why not? If you met her, you might come around to understanding. I am immeasurably happy and sad to see her go.

1352476132.0,236,self.dogs,12x0m3,My Aussie rescue's first trip to a school to meet some kids,phorkor,284,48,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/12x0m3/my_aussie_rescues_first_trip_to_a_school_to_meet/,"I adopted my aussie from a local group in Houston called Barrio Dogs where we continue to work with them as a therapy dog of sorts (not certified yet but we're working towards it) and part of their educational and outreach program. Our main focus is educating young children in low income areas on the proper treatment and caring for animals. 

This past Wednesday was our first time to make a trip to a school together where I told his story about how he was dumped on the streets and literally sat on a corner for 2 weeks with no food or water ( aside from scraps people would throw at him), waiting for someone to pick him up then answered the children's questions and they were read a book called ""Henry, the Dog with no Tail"" which is about self acceptance of who you are and accepting others even though they may be different. Funny thing is, the dog in the book's names in Henry and is an aussie. [This](http://i.imgur.com/LCzgv.jpg) is my aussie Henry, who has no tail. 

Just wanted to share our first trip and brag of sorts about how wonderful he was with the kids and how much fun we had doing this. The pic above was when we first arrived and had to sign in. We met with some of the administration of the school and introduced them to Henry. [Here's a pic of me](http://i.imgur.com/mcF9a.jpg), quite nervous even though it's a bunch of 4th graders, telling Henry's story and how he came to me. After his story, I [walked him around](http://i.imgur.com/0clev.jpg) and let the kids meet him, say hi and answered questions. While the other person with me read the book he [sat there quite calm](http://i.imgur.com/bylTg.jpg) and just relaxed. After the book the kids got to come up one by one and say hi to Henry and [take a picture with him](http://i.imgur.com/ecXUw.jpg). I think he really liked the [teacher](http://i.imgur.com/xwcp8.jpg)

This being my first trip with him to a school I was a good bit nervous. He's always been wonderful around kids and never had any issues but usually at the other events we've done we were outside rather than in a confined classroom. As soon as we walked in he did his normal thing and I knew he was going to do great.

It was quite fun and amazing.

We do not know which dogs we will groom until we begin and the dogs were selected by drawing numbers from a hat. I received Brailie the 7 year old Yorkshire Terrier. She was in a matted condition and smelled of urine. I did not place in the contest but in the end she had a whole list of people interested in adopting her.

After doing this, I went a bit crazy and groomed our couches, and then the entire living room floor, followed by a quick vacuum. It took a while, but not terribly long, and have never seen the floors so clean since the day we moved in.

(Pictures included),CJDreadd,265,38,60,http://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/nb7mi/my_neighbor_neglected_his_puppy_until_she_was/,"I moved down from Connecticut to northern Louisiana to be with my boyfriend, who is in the Air Force. We found a nice little house in a modest suburb, surrounded by quaint residences all of which seemed to have pets.

Because the weather is so warm here, many dog owners give their animals free range in a fenced in yard. Some put their dogs on long leashes so they can roam their territory freely if the home does not have a puppy-proof fence.

The neighbor on my right was a single man that I'd estimate was in his thirties. From what I observed throughout my months as his neighbor, he was divorced with children who did not live with him. He ""cared"" for several cats, most of which were not neutered or spayed, but were friendly, and appeared to be fed on a regular basis.

--- ABOUT THE PUPPY ---

In early spring of 2011, a little puppy appeared in my neighbor's back yard. She was sweet, yipping nervously at me as I'd walk from my car to the house. At this point in time my neighbor had her on a long plastic covered wire staked close to the house, where she could escape from the hot sun. (Many houses in Louisiana do not have basements and are raised about a foot off of the ground.)

I eventually introduced myself to my neighbor and admitted how much I adored his puppy. I asked if I could walk and play with her, and he obliged. He told me her name was Honey.

As the weeks went by and the weather got hot, my neighbor did not bring Honey indoors. Not ever. Not in rain nor heat. She'd weathered more than a few storms in a flooded dirt yard. 

She often had old food in her dish, and a large plastic bin for a waterbowl since she tended to tip other bowls over. Once I leaned over the fence to see her and saw her owner had given her a large, dark looking piece of meat. It was the only thing in her food bowl. Definitely not fit for a puppy.

Soon he moved her to a spot behind his shed, further from the house because she'd been digging holes in the grassy parts of the yard near the house. I think she was trying to stay cool. There were no trees around the house, so this was her only option. The below pictures are from this time. It was early June when I took these.

http://i.imgur.com/UgIJa.jpg
http://i.imgur.com/XHKOF.jpg
http://i.imgur.com/lUwm7.jpg

I expressed to my boyfriend, an adamant dog lover, my concern of Honey's wellbeing. The below pictures are of her in her yard, a few feet from where she was tethered behind a shed. He took it upon himself to suggest to the owner (in a very strong way) that he should get her to a vet. She wasn't looking very healthy, and was acting sick. Her lethargy only abated in the first minutes I'd visit her each day.

http://i.imgur.com/s2JZm.jpg
http://i.imgur.com/LC7Uo.jpg

From there it only seemed to get worse. The below picture was taken at the end of June.

http://i.imgur.com/UH2ZY.jpg

He never took her to see a vet, despite saying that he would. Her neck was worn from her collar. Her water was opaque and green with algae, and her food covered in flies after she'd thrown up in it. I purchased a large bag of puppy food and started cleaning out her bowls daily. She was not interested in eating.

I called animal control. 

They said they had someone check on the puppy, but the puppy was not there. I called again and told them that the puppy was there, and I was there, and I could bring them into my yard and show them. Behind our street is a public dirt road, and she was easily visible. I called for a week straight, and each time they gave me another excuse.

""The dog wasn't there.""
""We couldn't locate the residence.""
""We found the location, but there was no sign of any dog.""

I continued to give her food and water. I bathed the fleas off of her. I tweezed plant spikes out from the pads of her feet. But I couldn't bring her to the vet to get proper care, or give her to someone who would appreciate her. She wasn't mine.

On July nineteenth, just as I was about to go to sleep, I went outside for something or other and found her wandering in my driveway. She'd snapped out of her collar, walked around the fence and her yard and into mine, and from there she didn't know what to do.

She was having difficulty breathing, she couldn't open her eyes and her nose was flaking. She shook and cried.

http://i.imgur.com/mfCvq.jpg
http://i.imgur.com/XuHGM.jpg

Animal control dismissed my reports. The police directed me back to animal control. 


--- HAPPY ENDING! ---


That night I brought her back to her yard, gave her food and water, and went to bed. The next day, my previous neighbor's wife (she now lived a few blocks away. We'll call her Pam) came to see me.

Pam was concerned about the dog too.

I told her that he wouldn't even notice if the dog was gone. He didn't care about her, and it was obvious. She said she'd love to take her, but how could we get her owner to just give her away?

""We see that you don't care about your animal, so we'd like to take her and give her a proper home."" I didn't see that going over well.

I jumped the fence, removed her collar and carried her to Pam's car in broad daylight, and she drove home.

She brought Honey to the vet. Honey had worms, pustules on her stomach from laying in the dirt, severe dehydration and was not as large as she should have been at that age.


It's been about five months and today Honey (renamed Basha) is happy, healthy and plump. She cuddles at every opportunity and is an incredibly loving, happy dog. 


The kicker? The neglectful neighbor never asked about the dog. The food and water bowls are still in his yard.

I am a volunteer for Midwest Shiba Inu Rescue. Recently, we got a call about a dog that was found as a stray in Oklahoma city. Based on the picture the woman sent us, all I could tell was that he was very, very dirty. We had no idea how bad it would be!

We drove for 5 hours to go get him and bring him to our home so he can be our foster dog and adjust to a normal life. When we got there, it became apparent that he had badly matted fur and ticks. We bathed him when we got home and found loads of ticks, blood, mats, plant matter, grease, dirt clumps, and he became 2-3 shades lighter. The water from his first bath was mud colored.

We set up an appointment with both a vet and a groomer(he still wasn't entirely clean and needs professional help).

* **Vet Check**

The vet says he fractured all 4 of his canine teeth chewing on metal or a rock type surface for a prolonged period of time. All four of his teeth had received zero medical care &amp; were broken at separate times.

He appeared to have difficulty getting up the stairs, so we had the vet check his knees. He has grade 3 and 4 luxating patellas in his right and left back legs. His right leg is also badly arthritic. He will need corrective surgery on both legs to have a normal life.

He has intestinal parasites! We noticed that he seemed to be whining a lot for no determinable reason, and that he had trouble going poop. Well, his parasites cause stomach and intestinal pains and make going the bathroom uncomfortable. He's now on parasite meds. 

We are still waiting for the results from his heartworm test.

* **The Vet's conclusion**

Extreme neglect. This dog has obviously not been kept indoors or cared for for a very long time. It takes many months for a collar to become stuck to a dog's fur with sticky, matted grease. 

Shibas are well known for having knee problems and he appears to be a well bred male-an expensive puppy indeed. Yet, no microchip, no medical care for obvious problems, and no owners are looking for him. 

His teeth must have been like this for over a year! You HAD to have noticed his limping on three legs or having trouble walking! 

Amazingly, he has a **wonderful** personality. He is sweet and friendly towards everyone, and I have introduced him to several aggressive dogs(in a controlled setting) to gauge his response and he didn't care that they were barking and lunging at him. He ignored it.

* **The Rescue**

MSIR is an amazing rescue that is truly willing to do anything for a dog. He will be receiving extremely expensive surgeries(the vet quoted us at 2k per knee surgery) and every thing else he could possibly need because they are committed to helping him. They are even holding a fundraiser on his behalf later this year. 

* **To his last home**

If you come looking for him,you won't be getting him back. He is finally going to get all the love and care he deserves.

UPDATE!!!

Bo got checked out by our local vet this morning. Good news is he doesn't have any heart or lung problems!! His ears are very bacteria and yeast infested from the previous owners neglect, but we got two types of medication to help with that. As for his hypothyroidism, we received pills and gave him one. Just an hour later he barked for the first time! He will be going back to the vet in two weeks for a recheck of his ears.

if you cant drop a piece of food on the ground without the dog making a mad dash for it despite saying ""no!"" you need work in this area, you own whatever food you hold or drop unless you say its ok.

the trash is the same deal, as soon as you arent looking the dog shouldnt be going to get into the trash or counter surf, if this is happening there are ways to resolve that as well. google the many methods and work on it until something works, if you want to ask for advice on a certain issue then just ask here for others to offer what worked for them.

Immediately upon hopping out of the truck, my friend's dog zoned in on her and ran at her barking. Not aggressively, but enough to startle our sensitive girl. She backed out of her flat collar and ran into the middle of the road. I called her desperately, thinking that she would get hit by a car. As I started advancing toward her, she bolted. Being a black dog on a rainy/misty night, she was lost almost immediately.

**Many people say it takes days or weeks for a lost dog to slip into ""survival mode"" - that is, they revert totally back to their instincts and pretty much become wild. They don't recognize anyone or anything that they know, even their own family. However, I think the combination of Bella's sensitive personality and the fact that she was startled in an unfamiliar place made her revert almost immediately.**

This happened at approximately **9:30 PM on a Saturday night**. Right away, many people at the party grabbed flashlights and started calling her. Already disoriented and scared, this probably freaked her out even more than she already was. 

**11:00 PM Saturday:** A neighbor spotted her in the road about 100 yards from where she got loose. He tried calling her and she bolted - again. 

**2:30 AM Sunday:** Luke and I were just about to give up and go to bed after searching for 5 hours. About 4.5 of those hours were on foot, the other half hour was circling the area in his truck. JUST as we were about to make the turn to go home, we spotted her IN MY FRIEND’S DRIVEWAY. I was so relieved! I opened the truck door and called to her. She bolted - again. Luke and I spent the next four hours in his truck waiting and watching for another sighting of her. 

**6:30 AM Sunday:** As soon as the sun rose, we were out walking.

**10:00 AM Sunday:** We got a phone call that Bella had been spotted 3 miles from where she had gotten loose. Hopped in the truck and patrolled that area for about an hour until we got another call that it was a false alarm - the dog spotted was black, but much smaller than Bella. We stopped to get some food and caffeinated drinks and we patrolled the rest of the day in the original area.

**6:00 PM Sunday:** Luke needed to get some sleep, because at this point he still thought that he was going to have to be at work on Monday morning. The plan was to sleep until dark, then he was going to drive home and I was going to stay behind to keep searching. Except just as we were laying down, we got a call that she had been spotted in a hay field across the street from my friend’s house. 

**7:30 PM Sunday:** We tracked her down in a hedgerow along the edge of the field. She tried to make herself invisible and allowed us to get within 20 ft of her because I think she thought we couldn’t see her. The second I said her name she was up and gone. At this point Luke realizes he cannot go back without Bella and calls out of work for Monday.

**8:00 PM Sunday:** We realized we needed to change our game plan. A guy who lives nearest the field she was spotted in graciously allowed us use of his garage. We scrounged up every pair of our dirty clothes that we could, and made a nest of them in the garage along with lots of tasty/smelly food and a bowl of water. Then, we waited. And spent yet another night in Luke’s truck. No sign of her all night.

**7:00 AM Monday:** We went back to Luke’s house to regroup. We knew we were running out of time and chances to catch Bella. We even discussed traps and drugging. Once we ate breakfast, it was decided that we would just hike around the area she was last seen. If we did get lucky enough to spot her, we would wait for her to approach us.

**8:30 AM Monday:** I thought it might help if we had another dog that Bella knows, so I left to pick Radley (my parents' dog) up from the kennel. On my way to the kennel, we got a call that Bella was spotted in the same field she had been spotted around throughout the weekend. Hauled ass up there. 

**9:30 AM Monday:** Radley and I took a hike through the fields and waited for a sighting.

**10:30 AM Monday:** It seems that possibly Radley’s scent stirred Bella up and Luke spotted her headed our direction, presumably to get a better idea of what she was smelling.

So I took the food, got as close as I possibly could without driving her away, and sat on the soaking wet, freezing cold ground with a bowl of tasty, smelly food next to me. I didn’t move, talk to her, or look at her. I just sat and waited for over an hour and a half. [This was my view.](http://i.imgur.com/5Yk7d.jpg)

**12:00 PM Monday:** Bella finally got brave (hungry?) enough to cautiously make her way toward me. She stopped about 10 feet away from me and started barking. Not a friendly bark either. I think she was trying to scare me off of the food. At this point I started to softly and calmly talk to her and slowly held out a piece of steak. I was so nervous - this was my ONLY chance to catch her. What if my frozen fingers didn’t react quickly enough to grab her? What if she freaked and bit me?

As she reached out to smell the steak in my hand, the most amazing thing happened. I watched as, within a split second, the realization came over her that this stranger was her MOMMY! I have never seen an animal so clearly have a moment of total relief and utter happiness. And in one second, it was all over. She was jumping and licking and whining and crying (oh wait, the crying was me!). 

**TL;DR...This was seriously the most harrowing experience I have ever had. I learned some very valuable information those few days and I'd like to pass it along.**

* If you have a sensitive dog who gets scared easily, do not EVER take them outside in a collar that they can slip out of. My dogs do not go anywhere without their martingale collars now. 

* If your dog is startled and is in a situation that could be dangerous (like standing in the middle of the road) DON'T freak out. They can tell and it makes them even MORE nervous. 

* If you suspect your dog has gone into ""survival mode"" but know their general location, don't call for them. Don't advance toward them. Sit and wait for them to approach you. A dog's nose is its best sense. Get another animal that they know, your dirty clothes, smelly food, anything to help ""wake up"" the part of their brain that recognizes it.  They'll at least be close enough to grab if they still don't recognize you.

* If all else fails, set up a trap or hire a team of tracking dogs. Never give up - this animal is a part of your family. They're scared and alone. I know someone who's still actively looking for a dog who ran away over a year ago. 

* Get your dog microchipped! It didn't help in my scenario, but it was good to know that her information was out there and if someone picked her up they'd know she was ours.

* Make sure to get your dog's info out there: facebook, texts, craigslist, phone calls...etc. etc. I had total strangers out patrolling for her and by Sunday morning almost everyone in our township knew to drive slowly and carefully in the area where she was lost.

He tried to be a really manly dog, bouncing through woods, racing across fields. And when he was home, he was this brooding, deep creature. Sleeping, eating, or palling around with my dad. He always hated when the lil hyperactive child of the family came and gave him epic scratches or tickled behind his ears. Got all up in his space and stroked his fur repeatedly. I was the annoyance in his otherwise masculine lifestyle. But every now and then, I’d catch him. 

I remember being in the kitchen on a hot summer day and looking at him out the window. This dog, who’d usually just lounge about in the sun, was rolling around in the grass, tongue out and everything. He looked so silly, but it felt like he was smiling. Mid-roll he noticed me gazing at him and immediately got up. I could feel his darting eyes telling me “You saw NOTHING” before he walked out of my view. So a few minutes later, I go into the dining room. Sure enough, there’s Rex rolling around in the grass. I love to think there was that side to him. That the lavish amount of adoring attention I poured on him seeped out when he thought I wasn’t looking. He may have hated me a bit, but he was my brother. And I loved him.

He was put to sleep last night, after unfortunately being in tremendous pain. Rest in peace you pretentious bastard.",,False,,t5_2qhhk,False,,,True,t3_q8go0,http://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/q8go0/my_dogs_selfimage/,

They would drop her at the shelter if nobody took her. I spend a couple hours yesterday emailing and calling around to find a rescue group to take her and found [Little Paws Rescue](http://littlepawsrescue.net/) Turns out Julia does papillon rescue and is willing to take the dog. I went this morning to talk to the owner again and managed to convince her to give me the dog. So little Phoebe came home with me and will go home with the dog rescue later today. I cant believe the owner had this dog 13 years and not even a tear when I took her away. Interesting that there was a note from the neighbor on her door stating ""just to let you know, your dog barks all day."" I took Phoebe for a short walk, and she must have peed 100 times, some is marking, but I think there might be a bladder infection as well. Anyway, she will be checked a vet later and will have a good home for the rest of her life. Thanks for all the supporting comments yesterday.

We have one child together, a 3 year old girl. Our neighbors are a late 20's married couple whom we didn't meet before we moved in. We had a dog, a yorkie, who was out on her tie out stake in the yard. We hear her barking and I look outside and see this massive pit bull jump the owner's fence and attacked and killed our dog. Cops were called, owner was cited, etc. I invited the owners over to discuss what the next step was and surprise, surprise! They started blaming US! ""Your dog was barking way too much"" is what they told us and that's what triggered their dog, to jump the fence and attack our dog. It was one big argument fest that went nowhere. 

It killed us to not to be able to let my daughter go outside and play. We tried to be civil with out neighbors. One Saturday, my daughter, wife and I were outside just goofing off and here comes the dog again. Thankfully, I saw it in time and my wife rushed our daughter in. I was so furious! The next week, I went purchase my first handgun. I'm not a big gun guy, but I knew something had to be done. I saw my neighbor outside and brought him my receipt of purchase and calmly told him. ""I bought this. If your dog enters into my yard again and comes at any one of my family members or visitors, I'm shooting it. No questions asked."" He handed back the receipt and didn't say anything and walked back into his house. 

A few days later, someone he knows( a relative maybe) came get the dog. Hopefully, I never see it again.

Normally when we've had a stray come up to the house and bother our cat or get in the trash, we shew them away and they're gone. This guy doesn't want to leave at all. He's very content on my porch. My wife put some flyers up locally and I went and grabbed some food, toys and other things for him in the meantime. 

My wife and I have never had a dog. We have been toying around with the idea of getting one recently for 2 year old son. This guy seems to be really friendly and playful but because he's so big, my son can't run around in our yard because the dog wants to play and just knocks him down, scaring him. So, if no one comes to retrieve him and we decide to keep him, what can I do about this behavior? Can't I train him to allow my son to run around without knocking him over and biting? He does a lot of snipping too. When you're trying to walk, he's also intertwining in your legs, nearly tripping you or even snipping at your legs. Are these behaviors that can be trained away? What do I need to do if we keep him? Vet? Medicine? Food?

We go at least 4 or 5 times a week.  I know all the regulars and we've never had a single problem with any other dogs or owners.   I know park etiquette and how dogs play.  And we've been complimented many times on how well behaved our dog is.

So Saturdays usually bring out new people, or those that don't come to the park regularly.  There was a new couple with a Shihtzu I noticed, because they were quite hovering.  They just stood in the middle of the park and would constantly call their dog to come, when their dog was just running around playing.  

My pup is only 7 months and very inquisitive, especially of new dogs.  So he was following this Shihtzu around and kept smelling his butt.  He was not aggressive or humping the Shihtzu at all.  Well the owners didn't like this, and during a sniffing episode, came up and jabbed my dog on the back.  WTF?!!  I immediately went up to them and asked them what the fuck they were thinking.  My dog was doing nothing wrong and if they didn't like my dog sniffing their dog, it's ok to push him off, but don't fucking hit him.  Her response?  ""I didn't hit your dog.  If you watch Cesar Milan, you would know it's just a training technique.""  I went off.

Training technique?  Like how your dog's been ignoring you for 15 minutes while you stand here calling his name?  I asked if they've ever been to the dog park before because this is how dog's interact with each other.  I asked if they even have a dog park pass and if not, they better leave.  Don't come to the dog park and instill your stupid training techniques on other people's dogs, especially when they're just being dogs.  They left a couple minutes later.

I was at the Bear Creek (Bill Archer) Dog Park (Houston, TX) last night when this happened. The poor sweet dog had been with this family for 4 weeks and still did not have a name.
This dog came home with us and, for now, I'm calling her Rosie the Dog (as in Rosie the Riveter.)

She is just under 25 pounds and is still a puppy but I'm not sure how old. My guess is that she's 6 months old but the vet will give us a better estimate tomorrow. She will be getting her shots/heart-worm test, etc tomorrow.

She's definitely a mixed breed. I see Basenji (point ears, tail curls up when she's relaxed) and Pit (broad forehead) and perhaps a bit of Lab (color). She is crate trained but doesn't seem to be (well) potty trained or know any commands. (Update: She has learned how to use the doggy door and has been outside several times on her own.)

She is a lover and eager to please. Her previous family had small children and she likes kids. She is obedient, she just doesn't know what is expected from her yet. She is a sweet girl who thinks she's a lap dog. Based on our past 20 hours together, I think she's very trainable. (If she wasn't, she wouldn't still be with me.)

It's not possible for her to stay with us and I may have to take her to a shelter. I don't want to do that. So...you know the drill, folks. Post Rosie on Facebook, suggest that your in-laws need a dog, spam (carefully) your friends.

Any help is appreciated.

Edit #1: We are in Houston, TX. 

Edit #2: She does appear potty trained but she needs some work. There have been no accidents in the house (or crate) for about 20 hours. When we go outside, she goes potty on command. ""Go Potty!"" and she does. :-)

Edit #3: I am willing to transport her within a day's drive from Houston.

Edit #4: The vet visit went very well. She is 28.5 lb. and is HEARTWORM NEGATIVE!! (This is very unusual for rescue dogs in Houston.) She is about 1 year old and has now had all of her shots. She'll get a canine influenza booster next week and will be spayed on November 10. She was a trooper and the vet thought she was wonderful.

The shelter manager's letter:

""I am posting this (and it is long) because I think our society needs a huge wake-up call.

As a shelter manager, I am going to share a little insight with you all - a view from the inside, if you will.

Maybe if you saw the life drain from a few sad, lost, confused eyes, you would change your mind about breeding and selling to people you don't even know - that puppy you just sold will most likely end up in my shelter when it's not a cute little puppy anymore.

How would you feel if you knew that there's about a 90% chance that dog will never walk out of the shelter it is going to be dumped at - purebred or not! About 50% of all of the dogs that are ""owner surrenders"" or ""strays"" that come into my shelter are purebred dogs.

No shortage of excuses
The most common excuses I hear are:

We are moving and we can't take our dog (or cat).
Really? Where are you moving to that doesn't allow pets?

The dog got bigger than we thought it would.
How big did you think a German Shepherd would get?

We don't have time for her.
Really? I work a 10-12 hour day and still have time for my 6 dogs!

She's tearing up our yard.
How about bringing her inside, making her a part of your family?

They always tell me:
We just don't want to have to stress about finding a place for her. We know she'll get adopted - she's a good dog. Odds are your pet won't get adopted, and how stressful do you think being in a shelter is?

Well, let me tell you. Dead pet walking!

Your pet has 72 hours to find a new family from the moment you drop it off, sometimes a little longer if the shelter isn't full and your dog manages to stay completely healthy.
If it sniffles, it dies.

Your pet will be confined to a small run / kennel in a room with about 25 other barking or crying animals. It will have to relieve itself where it eats and sleeps. It will be depressed and it will cry constantly for the family that abandoned it.
If your pet is lucky, I will have enough volunteers that day to take him / her for a walk. If I don't, your pet won't get any attention besides having a bowl of food slid under the kennel door and the waste sprayed out of its pen with a high-powered hose.
If your dog is big, black or any of the ""bully"" breeds (pit bull, rottweiler, mastiff, etc) it was pretty much dead when you walked it through the front door. Those dogs just don't get adopted.
If your dog doesn't get adopted within its 72 hours and the shelter is full, it will be destroyed.

If the shelter isn't full and your dog is good enough, and of a desirable enough breed, it may get a stay of execution, though not for long. Most pets get very kennel protective after about a week and are destroyed for showing aggression. Even the sweetest dogs will turn in this environment.
If your pet makes it over all of those hurdles, chances are it will get kennel cough or an upper respiratory infection and will be destroyed because shelters just don't have the funds to pay for even a $100 treatment.

The grim reaper
Here's a little euthanasia 101 for those of you that have never witnessed a perfectly healthy, scared animal being ""put-down"".
First, your pet will be taken from its kennel on a leash. They always look like they think they are going for a walk - happy, wagging their tails. That is, until they get to ""The Room"".

Every one of them freaks out and puts on the breaks when we get to the door. It must smell like death, or they can feel the sad souls that are left in there. It's strange, but it happens with every one of them. Your dog or cat will be restrained, held down by 1 or 2 vet techs (depending on their size and how freaked out they are). A euthanasia tech or a vet will start the process. They find a vein in the front leg and inject a lethal dose of the ""pink stuff"". Hopefully your pet doesn't panic from being restrained and jerk it's leg. I've seen the needles tear out of a leg and been covered with the resulting blood, and been deafened by the yelps and screams.

They all don't just ""go to sleep"" - sometimes they spasm for a while, gasp for air and defecate on themselves.
When it all ends, your pet's corpse will be stacked like firewood in a large freezer in the back, with all of the other animals that were killed, waiting to be picked up like garbage.

What happens next? Cremated? Taken to the dump? Rendered into pet food? You'll never know, and it probably won't even cross your mind. It was just an animal, and you can always buy another one, right?

Liberty, freedom and justice for all
I hope that those of you that have read this are bawling your eyes out and can't get the pictures out of your head. I do everyday on the way home from work. I hate my job, I hate that it exists and I hate that it will always be there unless people make some changes and realize that the lives you are affecting go much farther than the pets you dump at a shelter.

Between 9 and 11 MILLION animals die every year in shelters and only you can stop it. I do my best to save every life I can but rescues are always full, and there are more animals coming in everyday than there are homes.
My point to all of this is DON'T BREED OR BUY WHILE SHELTER PETS DIE!

Hate me if you want to - the truth hurts and reality is what it is.
I just hope I maybe changed one person's mind about breeding their dog, taking their loving pet to a shelter, or buying a dog. I hope that someone will walk into my shelter and say ""I saw this thing on Facebook and it made me want to adopt"".
That would make it all worth it.""

He is still at the shelter but now has an upper respiratory infection so is in isolation for the time being. He will be fine, but it makes us sad that he got sick from being at the shelter.

My wife walks dogs at the local animal shelter in The Woodlands, TX and a special dog has caught her eye name Samson.  He is a great dog but looks timid in his pictures and in his kennel.  She tries to walk him daily because he won't go in his doggy run and just holds it all day. 

Our dog is undergoing chemo next week, so adding to our family would be impossible at this time.

If you know anyone in the area that needs a good dog, we would be willing to pay half the adoption cost and throw in a big bag of food.

I was a victim to a seemly random and violent attack in my own home. Think generic SVU episode. But unlike SVU, they don't always catch the bad guy.

After months of refusing to leave the house out of growing fear, panic attacks and night terrors my clinical social worker brought up the idea of a PTSD service dog.  And after lots and lots of training and money, I am the proud owner of service dog trained for my specific needs. The bigger dogs frightened me so we agreed on a smaller breed. Because of that he doesn't always read as a service dog despite his identification. 

[obligitory photo of my rat terrier/PTSD super hero](http://imgur.com/j7N4WqY)

Now to the point.
It is getting harder and harder to take him out in public without people's interest in him causing me panic attacks and paralyzing fear.  I understand a lot of people don't know what a PTSD dog is, so as frequently as possible I try to use peoples inappropriate questions as a teaching/awareness moment. 

But honestly, as cute as any service dog is, it is not appropriate to ask probing questions- to any stranger really. I don't mind when people ask to pet him; I usually say yes. But more and more i get people asking:
""So what is PTSD?""
""Do you have PTSD?""
""Were you in the war?""
""How do i get one of those? I get nervous sometimes too.""
This kind of probing is triggering, and can cause me panic.

Yesterday I had this conversation with a random girl, probably about 25. She started petting the dog without asking. She asked what PTSD was. I explained it to her. To which she exclaimed loudly. ""Oh my God! Were you in the war?!"" I told her no, and explained that there are a multitude of reasons someone would get a PTSD dog. Her next question was the kicker. ""I bet your husband beat you. He beat you didn't he?""


Again, I really don't mind anyone acknowledging he is there, that he is cute. I don't mind people asking to pet him.
Most times I don't even mind explaining other types of service dogs beyond the token seeing eye dog as well as what a PTSD dog can do to help their person.

[happy ending],Byeka,228,41,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/117h6j/my_dog_fell_into_the_pool_with_the_winter_cover/,"I'm inside yesterday and I hear my dad suddenly shout 'HELP!' in a clearly panicked manner. I rush outside to see my 70 pound Collie-Shepherd sitting on top of the winter pool cover which we just put in! Just to give some background - he's about 13 years old and we've had him for over two years and he's never ONCE fallen in. He's also starting to have trouble with the stairs so I knew it might be tough to get him out.

I rush into the scene, moving my dad out of the way so I could get a better grip and we start trying to pull out my dog (Murray) from behind. The whole time Murray is sitting there with a clearly stunned ""WHAT JUST HAPPENED?"" sort of look. 

Slowly but surely we manage to pull him out closer... closer... until he's out of the pool and onto the concrete with us. There wasn't much water on the cover but there was enough to get him fairly wet so of course he thanks us by shaking off all over us. The next part is amazing - he starts bouncing around, jumping all over the place in an EXTREMELY playful mood! One I haven't seen him in for a long while due to his low energy in his old age.

He was so happy, I don't know if it was the fact that he had a bit of an adventure or he just saw that we cared about him so much that we pulled him out of the water. Either way, it was hilarious.

That's it! Just felt like sharing this entertaining story!",,False,,t5_2qhhk,False,,,True,t3_117h6j,http://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/117h6j/my_dog_fell_into_the_pool_with_the_winter_cover/,

Symptoms now being: fluid in abdominal cavity, vomiting, lethargy, black diarrhea, dark yellow and abnormally little urine, and two seizures. I'm now calling vets within 2-4 hours from my location but Chinese language barriers and lack of education among vets is hindering the process.

**Old Original Post**Any tips on how to get him through the night? He's got a swollen stomach, lethargic, vomits anything he eats, has a blackish jellylike excrement, and I seriously regret not taking him this afternoon to get it checked out. He was bad the previous night but in the morning seemed rejuvenated so I thought whatever it was might have passed. Tonight it suddenly took a turn for the worse when he got hit by a sudden 30 second seizure and was foaming at the mouth. I know I should be asking a vet, but due to living in China that option isn't available for another 8.5 hours. Any ideas or tips would mean a lot.

Edit: 3 hours later he suffered a second seizure, this one closer to two minutes. After ten minutes he was able to weakly walk around, and has since laid down to sleep. He has sought out the coldest, darkest part of my house, which happens to be the bathroom. Still got another 6 hours before we can get him in to the vet.

Edit 2: no more seizures, just some minor shaking and vomiting. I'm at the vets now. I've managed to explain the situation in chinese, and it's becoming evident that surgery is going to be necessary. Really appreciate the concern and suggestions from everyone, it's been a long 12 hours.

My parents moved from a house into an apartment so My boyfriend's parents were looking after her. I think she missed my parents too much and is maybe trying to find them. She is not a dog that goes wandering so it's so strange that she would disappear like this. Homeward Bound could happen in real life right?

Anyway, I need your help, please email your friends, post on twitter, FB and blogs. Show your nan, your best friend, that random dude on the street. I really need to find my dog. I am offering a reward for her return but am offering free hugs and good vibes to anyone and everyone who helps by sending an email/ posting about it.

I had told the vet that the shelter had my information because they didn't want to facilitate the meeting for some reason. They verified the dog identity with the family, and that the dog was lost.

I temporarily moved back home with my parents to save a bit before graduating. I've had my boxer, Ginger, since she was 8 weeks. Technically, she's registered to my stepmother, but I was the sole caretaker. I took her to the vet, paid for her food, and did everything in my power to make sure she was well-loved and well-cared for. I was hesitant to move back home because my dad has always strongly disliked animals-especially dogs. I had very few options at the time, so I did my best to keep Ginger away from him while at home. I was sure to crate her when I wasn't there so that she couldn't cause any issues-and she didn't. She's well-trained, and super friendly...even to my dad who hates her. On Friday May 17th, I came home from work to find Ginger and her crate gone. I asked my parents where my dog was, and they said they ""got rid of her"". I asked repeatedly where my dog was, but the wouldn't tell me anything. The only information I was able to get was from eavesdropping on their conversations. I overheard that ""some guy adopted her"", and that they had taken her to be spayed that same day. 

I've checked the shelters, I've put ads on Craigslist, I've contacted my neighbors. I can't find anything. I've even snooped in my parent's offices to see if I could find anything written down...but nothing. What can I do? I'm completely heartbroken. I've since moved out, have cut all ties with my father and stepmother, and plan on searching until I find her. I keep hoping that I'll miraculously see her new owner walking her on the street, but I know those chances are slim. Any suggestions are appreciated.



EDIT: I MAY HAVE FOUND HER! I posted to ""Lost and Found Dogs"" on Facebook, and this guy contacted me claiming that he has her. I'm looking into it to verify that it's her. I'll let you guys know! Thank you so much for your kind words and suggestions. I can't even describe the emotion I feel right now!

When i was up walking around sometimes he would come lay down in front of me and chew on his working collar.  wherever i walked he'd move to be in front of me.  well tonight he started doing it and i sat down to study what he was doing. i was leaned forward on the couch when he stood up and walked to me and headbutted my stomach and kept pushing against me.  finally he had enough and put his paws on my shoulders and pushed me back against the back of the couch and kissed my ears and neck (like you might do a puppy).

this confused me as i had no idea what he was doing and he knows better than to get on people without being called. so i took him outside thinking maybe it was an emergency, he had no interest in anything outside and when i threw his tennis balls he hid all of them in the sunflowers (his sign of saying he didn't want to play).  He got really tense and tried to push me into the patio furniture.  That's when i figured it out.

I was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis January of this year.  as a result i am sometimes stricken with sudden total muscle exhaustion. We originally got magnus to train him to be a service dog.  as a result whenever i have these attacks i've given him the shirt i was wearing when it happened (about twice a week). i didn't think he'd pick it up this fast.  

So i sat down, as that was all I could do and he laid at my feet watching the door in an alert guarding position since my wife and daughter are out of town and i'm by myself.  While i sat there, effectively paralyzed i thought back and noticed that every time he chewed on his working collar in the last two weeks had corresponded with an ""attack.""  i just wasn't smart enough to put it together until now.

this is good, as the condition progresses it will lead to grand mal seizures that he will eventually be able to detect.

TL;DR magnus detected an MS attack that left me effectively paralyzed and i noticed he did it several times in the past few weeks corresponding with other attacks.  fucking awesome.",,False,,t5_2qhhk,False,,,True,t3_ile1o,http://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ile1o/my_rescuecompanion_dogs_new_trick_will_save_my/,

Recently I spoke with a k-9 officer John and met his dog Amanda. He said that a dog usually servers 8-10 years and when they retire their officer has the first pick to adopt the animal. He also said that no one from his department has ever turned down adopting their dog. This is because the dog not only serves with the officer, s/he lives with him/her also. The animal becomes part of the family. When John is away, Amanda stays at his home with his wife or with another trainer if the whole family is away. Amanda is from Holland and she is a fresh recruit, just over 1 year 3 months. She is trained in everything except cadaver search. She loves to lick your hands and John said that she will probably serve about 8 years and after that he will definitely elect to keep her. They've been together less than 6 months and they're both new to our K-9 unit. :) Mandy likes her commands in Dutch, not English. She was raised and imprinted by a company that specializes in training police, security and military dogs. At 9 months she joined the force and was assigned to John.

I have been in rescue as a foster for several years now, and my partner's family has been in rescue for over two decades. I also grew up with large-breed dogs, so I'm no stranger to the dog mindset. We bought his childhood house from his parents, so the neighbors know us pretty well, especially as the ""house with lots of dogs."" We even get knocks on our door to help round up stray dogs, when that happens, because we've got the best resources to both house a dog in an emergency (we're used to taking in rescues with little to no notice), and to help find its owner. Even though I weighed less than the last dog I was helping round up, I apparently had the better hand in that, because I'm not afraid to approach a horse-sized dog. If done properly, it's not scary.

I had read about ""zombie dog owners"" recently, but had yet to experience it for myself. As someone who takes in abused dogs, and as someone with a generally good sense of etiquette, I always ask ANYONE, EVERY TIME whether I may pet his or her dog. In the course of training and rehabilitating dogs, I have been bitten many times, but, you know, I'd rather not be bitten. 

My dogs (and the ones we foster) are also all of a breed bred (in the beginning) solely to hunt. They have a strong prey instinct, major pack loyalty and are not known to get along with dogs they don't know. Most will acclimate to people we show them are nice, but a few will never, ever trust strangers, and must be kept out of sight during parties. When folks out on the street ask to pet my dogs, I tell them, very politely, ""No, this is a vicious breed."" Four of my dogs can take off fingers without a thought, and it's sort of a joke within the community that, if you still have 10 fingers after a tooth-related encounter, you weren't bitten, just warned.

TL;DR: So, company's coming over. My smallest dog (10 lbs) was going to be allowed to run around during their visit, because they also have a small dog. My 35-lb dogs (all the rest, standard Dachshunds) were going to be kept away from the party, because my friend was bringing her 10-year-old daughter, and my Dachs could EASILY have knocked her over. 

I decide to take my min pin for a walk before they arrive, since, if she gets too excited, she'll make a poopie in the house. And new people are exciting. Though small, most min pins are pretty vicious little brats, and tend to write checks their butts can't cash. Look 'em up on YouTube. They're very loving, but VERY protective. This one had been left virtually untrained for the first 3 years of her life. 

My neighbor comes out of her house with her big dog. I think it was a goldie mix of some kind. It was on a leash at first. Then she lets the dog OFF the leash, without asking if this was okay. The big yellow dog goes into KILL mode and starts rushing us. I never took mine off the leash (I never do). But that doesn't mean they won't react to the approaching dog very negatively. I immediately pick mine up (I've had to do the dog protection thing before) and she shouts, ""Don't worry! He's friendly!"" I yell back, ""THAT'S GREAT! MINE ISN'T!"" 

The neighbor lady is otherwise very nice and I like her a lot, but I had yet to experience the ""zombie dog owner"" phenomenon until that moment. 

At the end of the day, I have to beg the public: please, just because you think YOUR dog is nice and wouldn't hurt other dogs, doesn't mean that the other dogs won't enter fight-mode on seeing it, and on being rushed at by it. I have to check the neighborhood before even walking my dogs, to make sure that people who repeatedly try to pet them, or think it's okay to walk their dogs without leashes, aren't there, because a dog fight is NOT something you want to experience. Not all dogs walk away from them without injury. YOUR dog may be a nice and friendly dog around other nice dogs and people, but you have NO way of predicting whether the other dogs you're approaching are the same way. While my dog, in this case, was about 1/10th the size of the other dog, I promise you, size doesn't mean much to them, and she very well had NO problem starting a fight she couldn't win.

Please, please, ask first, before just letting your dog off the leash to ""play"" with mine. I won't call the authorities if I get bitten in the course of breaking up a dog fight, but I'd rather never have to break up a fight, and I'd like to walk away with all 10 fingers and toes, and a dog I don't have to take to the ER.",,False,,t5_2qhhk,False,,,True,t3_1033kz,http://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1033kz/zombie_dog_owners_just_because_your_dog_is/,

I was 8 years old and me and my Ma went up to visit my uncle which was a huge treat for me. You were whimpering with all your brothers and sisters and climbing over your mum, it broke my heart then to hear you seemingly upset. We put you in the car and I sat in the back middle seat with you to my left. I even put the seatbelt around you. You lifted your head up and placed it in the small of my back and went to sleep. I fell asleep too. When we woke up we had arrived at my house and I took you inside. Made your bed, got you the toys I’d bought for you and then got swiftly sent to bed myself. Waking up that morning was amazing. I climbed into your bed next to you and just laid there playing with you for hours. It was the start of something special, something I now appreciate as the best friendship of my life. 

You were so funny, watching your tiny form trying to climb onto the couch was just about the cutest thing I had ever seen! On those hot summer days I’d take you out with me at 8am til 8pm just loving the fact that I was with my best friend. I suffered with migraines, but they hurt so much less when you climbed up next to me, guarding me, caring for me, loving me. 

Through puberty I wasn’t as good as I could have been. I was a little inattentive, sometimes brisk, I didn’t have enough patience for you. That’s something I hold to this day, and I will never forgive myself for. I was having councelling sessions at school because I was being bullied. I didn’t tell anyone in the family, and I didn’t have any friends to tell except one. And you were there for all of that. The only one I had to talk to. The one who was always there no matter what. I was so proud of you, every day I was so proud of the girl you were. Walking around with you was so incredible, everyone loved you, and I would have fought to the death anyone who said you weren’t the best thing to ever have existed. 

We grew a bit distant after I moved out. I didn’t see you so often, but when I visited I gave you all the attention I could, and I loved you so dearly. I missed you every day I didn’t see you, even after I moved to another town you were still where I left you when I came back, still loved me even though my life had gone on. I had two long term failed relationships under my belt and I was 21 years old. I was in bed with the third one when I got the call. 
My heart broke. 

It couldn’t be happening. 

I got dressed and drove home to see you. And I’ve never rode my bike that fast in my life and never will again. 

You looked sad. You hadn’t drunk any water or eaten, and I tried so hard to get you to drink. You looked so uncomfortable laying on your front with no strength to do anything. You moved your head to look at me and I thought, for one moment, I saw the tiniest smile on your face. I laid down next to you like I did that first morning and told you how much I loved you. How you made everything that was terrible about school better, how you were my best and only friend. 

And then I told you that if it hurts too much that you should go, because I didn’t want to watch you suffer. I laid you on your side, you’d been on your front for so long. And then you went. 

It’s been a year now, and I still remember going outside, tears streaming down my cheeks. You weren’t just a dog to me Mollie, you truly were mans best friend, you were my guardian angel. I remember how exhausting it was lifting those heavy shovels of earth to make your grave. I remember how light you were when I carried you outside. I remember placing you in that cold ground. I remember the moment I placed that blanket over you. I remember when I had to say goodbye. 

Its been a year now, and I still think of you. I still think of my best friend. I still think of the one who made everything better. I still think of you every day.

I hope wherever you are, you think of me too. And I hope you still have that silly puppy smile you always did. I hope you get to look over me. 

I hope I’ll see you one day.

After playing with the dogs in the house, the coworker let his dogs out in the backyard to go to the bathroom.  After a couple minutes only one dog returns with bite marks all over its face.  Coworker goes outside to check on the other dog and finds it in the neighbor's backyard being thrashed by the neighbor's dogs.

Turns out the neighbor's 3 dogs (I won't mention the breed) broke through the fence and attacked our coworkers dogs, dragging one of them back to their yard.

The police/animal control have taken the neighbor's dogs and will likely put them down last I heard.  The saddest part of all of this was the coworker bringing the poor dogs body back for the other dog to see that he is gone so that it understands what happened.  The two were brothers.

The doors open, and our neighbour from down the hall with his enormous american bulldog is standing there. Farley, being a baby, is super excited to see a person AND a dog, and starts jumping and pulling, wanting to get onto the elevator and say hello. I hold him back, smile politely, and the guy suddenly jumps back in the lift and shouts ""WHOA!"" as dramatically as possible. He then takes extra great pains to get out of the elevator and stay as far away from Farley as possible. He turns as he's going down the hall, scowls at me, and snaps ""Your dog is aggressive!"".   
It was so bizarre. Am I right in thinking that was an extreme overreaction, or is it really that terrible that my puppy is getting excited by new experiences? He does like to jump up on new dogs and play with them, so I hold him back or try to distract him with one of the tricks he's learned in puppy class. But this guy acted like my 13lb puppy was trying to maul his 120lb bulldog (and the dog himself didn't even seem remotely bothered). Whacky neighbour?   
**Edit:** Not 180lbs, but definitely very very big.   
**Edit 2:** Some photos of Farley, as requested: [Farley loves cat toys](http://imgur.com/SLC5h7C) - [Farley in the snow](http://imgur.com/gnvw4Ed) - [Farley being a ladies man](http://imgur.com/rgMuThP) - [Farley giving me THE LOOK](http://imgur.com/Nuowich)   
**Edit 3:** One more for the road... I thought it best to mention that Farley *is* in training, and I work very hard with him for hours each day. I had him under control, and while I do admit I don't know this guy or the history of his dog, I'm not the sort of person who lets my puppy *anywhere* near strange dogs without their owner's permission. That's just a recipe for disaster.

Bull crap.   This dog knows her commands, is remarkably intelligent, knows how to behave while we go hunting and absolutely loves being around people.


The two parties that gave her up before were so very unfortunate to see a dog mature into a magnificent beast and good four legged friend.

The Dog's 10 Wishes
---

1. Everytime we part is painful to me – even if it's only for a short while . Please consider this before taking me in to live with you.

2. Do not be harsh if I have to be punished. You have your job, your hobbies, you have friends and goals – but I only have You.

3. Please allow me to take my time trying to understand what it is that you wish from me.

4. Before you would hit me please remember that I could easily crush your hand in my jaws, yet I would never do a thing like that.

5. Please do talk to me sometimes. I may not understand every word you say, but I know the shades and tone of your voice very well.

6. Don't forget that I was a wild creature once. Let me run around and enjoy moving in the green fields or the forest once in a while – which will be good for you as well.

7. I ask you to be generous with tasty snacks. They always taste the best when received from You – and so I do my best to earn them.

8. You are my Master – not anyone else. So please don't ask me to heed to others' commands or that I humiliate or shame myself in front of them. 

9. Do remember that in time I too develop a personality, behavior and feelings of my own. Please recognize and accept that these are as important to me as are your own to You.

10. Take care of me if I become sick or old – after all, You will grow old with age one day...

Found this little guy in my garage last night. He was pretty hungry and looks like he's been on the street for a while. I'm working on making some posters but have no idea what breed he is. He could either be a puppy or be a a miniature breed of some kind. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks guys!

UPDATE: Wow! Thanks for all of the great response. I'm sorry I couldn't reply to everyone but I have been reading most of the comments throughout the day. There was a lot of good advice here. I will be taking him to get scanned for a microchip maybe tomorrow. I had to go to work for a little while and then have been spending time with the little guy. He's so much more comfortable and is letting me pet him. He doesn't shake anymore and isn't hiding. It seems like he has some fleas. I sprayed him with my dog's flea spray and I'm going to try to give him a bath tonight with some oatmeal flea shampoo. He's a lot happier so I think I can get him into my car to go to the humane society to get checked out. I called but they didn't have any lost dogs that matched his description. I'll keep trying and I've completed the found dog poster. I'll ask around my neighborhood as well. Thanks everyone and I will try to respond to as many of you as I can. Also, as requested, I will update the story as I know more. Thanks a bunch! 

UPDATE 2: Here's my new post updated. There's some pictures in there after I gave him a bath and fed him. He's following me around everywhere now like... well... a lost puppy. He's so loving, I feel like someone probably misses him.

I love dogs - always have, always will. I have grown up with a few dogs and adopted one of my own about 2 years ago. But respecting dogs as the canines they are is an important point that some people forget in their adoration of dogs (me included).

A few years ago I was at the home of a fellow I was dating at the time who had a gorgeous and sweet bull mastiff. I'd gotten to know the dog, spent a good amount of time playing and petting him, and felt very comfortable around him, so assumed he was also very comfortable around me.

One day we were heading out somewhere to grab a bite to eat and I went to go ""give kisses"" to the dog when suddenly I heard a loud growl/bark and felt teeth in my face. Yup, like an idiot I'd stuck my face near the dog's face and that agitated him, so he bit me straight in my face. Almost took out an eye and I still have some minimal scarring (amazing how the face/body can heal!), but it was a hard lesson learned.

I know most know this and don't need a reminder, but hearing/watching her story and watching the video reminded me of my experience. I don't blame the dogs - people tend to forget dogs ***aren't people*** and our way of interacting is not like theirs. So just remember that before getting too close + cuddly with an adorable dog - especially if it isn't yours.",,False,,t5_2qhhk,False,,,True,t3_phwbd,http://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/phwbd/just_a_friendly_reminder_dogs_are_cute_but_they/,

My dog is about 1.5 years old and has a lot of energy. I've been practicing biking with him for a while under very controlled circumstances - we'd go to an empty school parking lot and ride around the building. Today, I really needed to wear him out before I go to work, so I decided we were ready to go on a trail.

We. Had. a **BLAST!!** We rode for about an hour. I was worried he might get too tired, but not even close. I let him set the pace the whole way; he sprinted at the beginning and then sprinted AGAIN for like half a mile at the end!

This is a Samoyed who rarely gets to be off leash outside the dog park (he's a roamer... only trustworthy in open spaces when he has a dog friend to play with). He was so, so happy to be able to let loose and run as much as he wanted. 

Oh - and he's usually reactive to other dogs, but while we were biking he was too focused to do anything more than glance their way. Awesome.

Another minute or two and it could have been pretty ugly.

So they seemed fine last night, I spoke to the vet and brought them in first thing this morning. The vet had to shave some of my male's face and clean out his wounds. They also gave him a rabies booster, antibiotics and an anti-inflammatory. So far so good. 

Then he takes a look at my little female, who appeared pretty much unharmed: turns out she had a [bad bite that punctured her throat,](http://i.imgur.com/gsNBa6L)only her thick fur saved her. She got her rabies and antibiotics and he gave me an antibiotic cream that I need to inject into the wound twice a day after applying a warm compress for 5 minutes.

In the end, the total bill was $875 but I am so glad I took them both in. My female's wound could have gotten really infected. Definitely looking into pet insurance now. My dogs have never gone to the vet for anything but shots and check-ups but this could have been a disaster.

EDIT: thanks everyone! Here's a [photo of the two of them recovering](http://i.imgur.com/N83sE6W) in the living room. I think they'll be ok although my wife isn't going to be too thrilled when she gets home and finds out I put almost $900 on the credit card!!

We went to Zagreb and they made new blood test which was even worse than last so he immediatly got blood transfusion from a dog wrom Dog shelter. Blood was little better tomorrow. They also gave him infusion and took his lymph nodes sample. They sent us to do the x-ray and ultra sound. On x-ray they found some liquid in his chest which is later confirmed on ultra sound that is lymph node. It is 7 cm big and it presses his vein. They took a sample from it, too. That is why he is swollen. Node samples showed that he's dealing with lymphoma. That is lymph nodes cancer. And I read later that this is stage 4 out of 5. They could perform operation and take that big node out, and than each week he should take chemoterapy. The other option is euthanasia. He is already so weak, didn't eat in three days, won't move and including his blood it is very likely he wouldn't survive surgery, which is btw very expensive. If he would survive that, they don't give him much chances to survive recovery. It would be torchure for him.

We are now home, after two days in hospital, and we finaly have right diagnose, but I'm so sad. I know what is right thing to do, because this is not quality life for him anymore, and it is only getting worse for all of us. But I'm so selfish and didn't decide yet 100%.

I can only say that I'm happy that Tango lived happy life and he was truly loved. Also, his cancer started making him problems only 2 weeks ago so he didn't suffer long.

It is very agressive cancer and you don't know that your dog has it until it is this bad. It is often found on some routine vet visit or while you are curing something else. 

I really love my dog and don't want him to suffer anymore. This is everything so fast :(

And yes, bite from those dogs is just a pure coincidence. Sadly, if we found all this earlier, his diagnose and prognose would be pretty much the same only he would maybe be stronger to survive operation and that would make his life little bit longer.

He is a good boy, you should see him how he went through all those exams and everything...

So so so sad :( **

**EDIT 2

Tomorrow I'm taking him to the best clinic in country, in Zagreb. I hope they will help him and/or find out what is going on. I did everything that I could here in Osijek, and yesterday I had to ask for advice here on reddit because I was desperate. Please keep in mind that we took my dog to vet 15 times and he was little bit better and we were expecting him to be ok. But, I can't wait anymore not knowing what is it. Thank you everyone for your advise and if anyone is interested I will update tomorrow.

**

First of all, sorry for my bad english.

I have a golden retriever, 8 years old, named Tango.

It all started one month ago when he was attacked and bitten by two dogs for no reason (my dog was on the leash, I was walking with him, and they just came out of nowhere). We cleaned his wound on the leg, but we didn't see bite on his body (it was covered by hair). He was acting sick, refused to eat and to walk... but we couldn't find any other bite so we thought he was just shocked.

A week later hair started to fall out and another wound showed up. It was full of pus (i think it's the right word). So, he was immediately taken to the vet where his wound was cut and cleaned and he got antibiotics and everything. Few days later he was getting better, wound was clean (I was cleaning it twice or three times a day), he started to eat normally and we thought he is fine (or soon he will be). His wound is now fine, new skin grew and hair is starting to grow.

Then, his right eye (precisely his third eyelid) became swollen and he was again taken to the vet. Long story short, four vets examined him, we tried three different types of drops and unguents (Tobrex, Maxitrol and now Chloramphenicol). All vets said they never saw anything like this. After ten days his whole head was swollen and he couldn't breathe normally, he started to snore really loud, and his left eyelid started to swell, and, I almost forgot, some white balloons are around, I forgot the name of it but it is also a part of the eye as they said to me). Fourth vet took his blood and results were very bad. Really high leukocytes and lymphocytes, and hemoglobin so low that vet said he wonders that my dog is still on his feet. Than he gave him antibiotics, iron... that helped him a lot (his lymph nodes became smaller (on his neck and under front legs because his rare legs nodes weren't big at all), he started to breathe normally again and snoring stopped...) but his eyes are the same or maybe even worse. We still don't know if his blood is better. I have to say that he eats a lot and is hungry (which is good, i guess) and he is very happy, walks normally... In my country is very hot (like 35-40 degrees) and my dog almost lost conscience twice (which is not so weird due to his anemia).

Did anyone have similar situation? I don't understand how is this all connected (bite-eyes-very bad blood results)? They think maybe he had chigoe that we didn't see (I don't believe this because I comb his hair daily and I would notice it) or it is some kind of bacteria/virus that he got from his wound when he was licking it or I don't know...) or worst case scenario that is leukemia (also how is that possible and what coincidence? and how is that connected to eyes?).

I'm so confused and under a lot of stress and I'm freaking out a lot because I don't see any improvements. It all together lasts one month (from the bite) and his eyes are swollen for two and a half weeks. I know that it can take a while to heal, but this seems to long.

I'm sorry for a long post, but I wanted to tell everything I could remember so anyone who knows anything about it can get a good picture about what's happening.

Please, give me your advice or opinion, I went to vet 14 or 15 times this month and I feel so helpless and I would do anything for my dog.

Here is the gallery (picture of the wound is from when it looked very bad, now it is ok): http://imgur.com/a/1OgsH

**EDIT:

Thank you everyone who are trying to help.

I'm from Croatia for those who are wondering.

Here is the picture of his wound today, I think it looks ok: http://imgur.com/mYlAK,JqaxE#1 And here are blood results (is that even a right word? I'm using it all the time, but not sure): http://imgur.com/mYlAK,JqaxE#0

About changing a vet; this last one was on his vacation and returned on Aug 20th. He seems like very good improvement because he (the vet) is actually doing something, dog is feeling little better and we know a little bit better what is wrong (blood results)... I think my vet is very good, but we don't have equipment for some better tests so he can only guess what could help him. Everywhere else in my town (it's a small town, 7 vet stations) they have same or worse equipment and you should see their attitude. Blah, I wish I went to vet school.

About medications; when he suffered from bite he was given amoxicillin (injections and pills). When his eye startet to swell they only gave him tobrex drops, and soon after that maxitrol (not sure if you know those meds?), and of course some vitamins and blahblah.... When we switched to this last vet, he changed his antibiotics to doxycyclinium (3+3 pills a day), and he gave my dog some pills against allergies (I'm not sure if they helped or not, but his face is not swollen anymore, except eyes). And he gave him iron (or something like that for his anemia) and I continued to give my dog some pills with the same purpose. Like I already said in comments, I don't know exact names of medications because they don't come in original packing and bills are hand written and very hard to read. The vet tells me what he gives him but I can't remember everything. 

And yes, we will take his blood again maybe even today...

In a few hours we are going to the vet again, I will write and bring your ideas and opinions and I hope we will find some solution. 

Thank you all and please post more if you have any idea!

Here is Tango when he is healthy and funny as he normally is: http://imgur.com/mQiYW

I tried to walk away calmly but he just got more excited and continued to scratch and bite.  It was hurting worse and worse and I couldn't get away or get him to stop.  I turned around and smacked him across the face.

I. Feel. TERRIBLE.  I've been doing clicker training with him and have been trying to be nothing but positive.  But I wasn't thinking clearly and just snapped I guess.  Sometimes when he is doing something he shouldn't my first reaction will be to say ""NO!"" or make an ""Eh Eh"" noise, which is also goes against positive training.

But if it doesn't come out of her by the time my parents come back, I have to tell them ""Hey, just so you know... she's going to crap out a condom. And if she doesn't, you'll have to take her to the vet.""

There wasn't anything in the /r/dogs search about condoms, so I'm just helping flush out the subreddit's content. You're welcome.",,False,,t5_2qhhk,False,,,True,t3_18pld3,http://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/18pld3/my_parents_dog_just_ate_a_used_condom_sigh/,

He's so smart and has the best personality. He had a tumor on his lip which my vet said was probably benign.  Well, we had it biopsied and it came back as a malignant locally invasive Acanthomatous Epulis.  I dropped him off this morning for surgery to remove both the tumor and the front part of his jaw.  It's the only way to cure it, or the tumor will just grow back.  (they will connect the two halves of the mandible with a metal pin)  Yeah..he's gonna be ugly and a messy eater...but I think he's worth it.  :)

I have 2 chihuahuas, and as I always do, I allowed them to stay out with us and see what was going on. They did as they normally do: sniff, watch, whine, bark a couple of times, investigate, etc. I made sure to keep them by me, although a couple of times they got a bit close before I called them back. 

The service guy then proceeded to tell me how just last week (or maybe it was month), the company had 7 biting incidents. In each case, ""they had them put down the dog"". I immediately took my dogs into the other room. Then realizing they hated this, I decided just to put their leashes on and keep them right next to me, taking no chances.

The technician told me how each time, the dog owners assured them that their dogs ""did not bite"". I could say the same for mine, however I didn't wish to take any chances should they become startled or have something happen that they didn't like and might cause them to bite. 

I just wanted to post this as a warning to those who allow their dogs to roam around when a stranger comes over. The technician let a good half an hour go by before telling me this, which I don't understand why he didn't give me the option of protecting us all sooner. So please, I will tell you all now...why take a chance? Lock up your dogs!

EDIT: No need to tell me now what I have already learned, and no need to berate me for not knowing/thinking about this. I'm sure I'm not the only one who doesn't lock their dogs up. Now I know, and I will do it. This post is intended for those who may not know/be oblivious/realize etc. about the dangers/inconsiderateness etc. of not locking their dogs up!

A couple hours ago, I spotted him sitting right outside the front door. I sit down, and he eventually lets his guard down enough for me to pet him. Now he's sleeping next to my desk, as you can see in the pic below.

I already checked him for a tag and called the local animal control. He's not a threat to anyone, so they told me to call back at 8 A.M. I've been thinking about getting a dog for myself for Christmas, and the timing seems just right for him to walk in.

He could be microchipped, but if not, do you think it's plausible to keep him? Any pet not claimed for 3 days on base goes up for adaption, and they'll take care of the vetrinary services as part of the adoption fee. I didn't really have a breed in mind as it is, and he seems like what I would want in a dog (not to big/small, gentle temperment).

TL;DR: Stray walked into my job, and is cool. I was thinking about getting a dog anyways, but should I take him in after he gets checked out?

PIC: http://www.imgur.com/5n7fD.jpeg

EDIT: Bonus points for whoever can tell me the breed.

UPDATE: The dog is in the shelter on base for now. His holding period is up on Friday, and I'll be able to take him in as a foster after that. He's a known stray, and has wandered a large chunk of the base, so other than Craigslist, there's no real way to pinpoint which neighborhood to canvas with fliers. There was no microchip, so he's probably not from the housing here, even though he seems to be in great condition. I'll get to visit him tomorrow, and will probably update again once I talk to the shelter.

Other than CL, is there anywhere I can post up that he's found? Somehow, I don't think covering half the base in fliers is gonna work if he's from the other side of base.",,False,,t5_2qhhk,1355253525.0,,,True,t3_14ncil,http://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/14ncil/stray_dog_literally_waked_into_work_not_sure_if_i/,

Followup.",,160,18,85,http://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/kd861/found_a_stray_the_owner_contacted_me_sounded/,"Original post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/k3urh/found_a_stray_the_owner_contacted_me_sounded/).

In a nutshell, I wanted to do the right thing and return a stray to her rightful owner, but something about the guy was fishy.

In case anyone wonders, here's what happened next.

The following day, I phoned the owner again and asked more questions, including those Redditors suggested. He repeated that the dog was vaccinated, but when I asked for the license number, he said he lost it. He couldn't remember the vet station's name or address, either.

""Sir, she hasn't been vaccinated, has she"", I asked.
""It's a dog, not a child"", he said. ""Can I have her back or what?""

Next I asked if he'd chip in for the veterinary bills. The dog came to me with piroplasmosis and her treatment was costly, but I didn't really want money - I wanted to hear his reaction.

He said he'd give me ""what he could"", but he didn't want to see the bills - if the dog was so expensive to get treated, he said, I was stupid to have paid for it. I should have just let her die, he argued, because ""it's not the only dog in the world.""

I asked him why he wanted her back in the first place.
""Huh? To watch my property.""
""Always chained?""
""You know what, sir? Enjoy the dog. Goodbye"", he said and hung up.

It was a week ago and I haven't heard from him since, so I take it this means I keep her.

In the end, my feelings are mixed. I'm glad I helped her, but I won't be able to do anything for the next dog this guy gets. Or guys like him.

/r/dogs, thank you for your help and support in this. I'll post her aaaaaaaw-inducing pictures to repay you :)

Well tempered and socializes well-ish with other dogs so long as it's only one or two, after that she gets a bit overwhelmed and tries to hide. oddly though she is kind of a dominant with other dogs and prefers males to females. With humans though she is relatively submissive.

She has a high prey drive so maybe not the best with cats. she knows sit and is working on heel, down, being well mannered (not jumping or barking) and walking on a lead. I haven't named her yet but will need to soon if someone doesn't take her. 7/8ths house broken, she does fine inside but needs to be let out every 4-5 hours and once she needs to go she NEEDS TO GO, but she knows to alert her humans when she's ready. She is seriously the most beautiful dog I have ever seen, even the picture falls a bit flat. She needs a good home and I very much am falling in love with her but I already have one little guy and she is a bit big for my apartment (44lbs at this point will probably add a few more before she stops growing).

He sleeps in bed with me ever night and he is a super snuggler, during the cold months he actually sleeps completely under the blanket with his nose snuggled into my back, during the warmer months he just sleeps with his head on my chest. 

Well my boyfriend sleeps over fairly regularly now which has become quite miserable as he likes to snuggle too, so every night I just get squished in between them and it is the worst and I refuse to kick my dog out of my bed. 

So the other night I was so sleepy and I had a big day at work the next day so I took a pillow and a blanket and went and slept on the couch. About five minutes later when my dalmatian realized I wasn't in bed he came out saw me on the couch jumped right up and snuggled with me, even though only about half of his body was being supported. Just made me feel so loved by my big guy. 


**tl;dr left bed because I was being squished between dog and boyfriend, dog came and snuggled with me even though he was more comfortable in my bed.**

This is a list of all the resources I wish I had in one place when I got a dog. Hope it's helpful.

As far as finding a dog: try http://www.petfinder.com/ Pet Expos are also great. The one in Orange County is the largest (I think) http://petexpooc.org/ but there are Expos in most major cities. The nice thing about Pet Expos is you're adopting (yay!), it's way cheaper, they usually micro chip your dog for free, and they usually give you a gift certificate for vaccinations. My dog, Lola only cost $200 to adopt (my dad paid over $1500 for his dog from a breeder). The expo gave us a gift certificate for $250 to a vet, so her vaccinations and spay only cost us like $500 instead of $750. And expos usually have a TON of dogs, so you can get the breed you want. You can go to a ghetto vet for vaccinations but choose a NICE, reputable vet for spaying or nuetering. If the vet fucks that up the dog can be incontinent for the rest of its life.

Also, look into positive reward training. No shock collars, no choke chains, no hitting, etc. Seriously for realz, don't hurt pupz.

I really like these dog trainers: http://www.youtube.com/user/zakgeorge21/videos?flow=grid&amp;view=0 and http://www.youtube.com/user/kikopup/videos?flow=grid&amp;view=0

I used a combination of these two videos to teach Lola to walk on a loose leash: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIdeT5S9u4Y&amp;list=UUZzFRKsgVMhGTxffpzgTJlQ&amp;index=119&amp;feature=plcp and http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8cPkTh7Y3k It for realz takes like 1-2 months to get your dog to walk reliably loose leash...be prepared and don't get frustrated. Also, if you get a pup, they're not supposed to go outside until they get their last round of parvo vaccinations. Make sure to walk them around the house regularly (like in the second video) even if you can't walk them outside of the house.

This is the best harness for walking: http://www.premier.com/View.aspx?page=dogs/products/collars/easywalk/description IF they do pull, the strain is on their chest, not their throats. Dogs can actually collapse their tracheas if they pull too hard on a collar.

This is the best video for teaching your dog ""leave it"" (the most helpful command when they're a puppy and want to chew on everything): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8i-L3-gqWic

If they simply won't stop chewing on something, buy this: http://www.amazon.com/Grannicks-Bitter-Apple-Bottle-Ounces/dp/B00028ZMEO (you can buy it at petsmart or petco). It's non-toxic, but it tastes really terrible so they won't chew on anything it's sprayed on (table legs, text books, shoes).

I would highly recommend getting your pup around other dogs as much and as soon as possible. Dog parks are the best for this. It's good if you have a friend with another dog, but it's best if your pup interacts with a lot of different dogs. You know those dogs that bark when other dogs pass them? Or even bark at dogs down the street? Or the dogs that attack other dogs instead of play? Those are dogs that weren't socialized. They don't know how to hang with the other pupz.

Oh, also, try to touch your puppy a TON. Touch their head, nose, ears, tail, paws constantly. Get the dog used to being touched wherever. This will make them generally chill and also make things like brushing and grooming and baths WAY easier.

This is the video I first found on crate training for potty training: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vj6oYjcOPuA. This video has additional tips to make the process easier: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvPiFcG7ROI&amp;feature=plcp. Potty training takes a couple of months. And there will probably be a month or so when your pup won't be able to hold it for the entire night. That means you'll have to get up around 4am every night to let them out. For a month. Be prepared. And there will be accidents (lots). This is by far the best product to clean them: http://www.ilovenaturesmiracle.com/home/index.php (you can get it at Petsmart or Petco). I figured out that I needed to reserve the best treats for potty training. Lola responded real quick to that. Every time she went to the bathroom, as soon as she'd start we'd say the command ""go pee"" and when she was done give her the tastiest fucking treat ever (she got roast beef). She learned pretty quick after that.

As far as toys: try to buy rubber or rope toys. Puppy teeth will shred anything soft. Also, I've heard if you get dogs plush toys, they gets used to chewing on soft things like clothes, shoes, and pillows. If they only ever get rubber or rope toys, they're less likely to think pillows are toys. My favorite brand is Kong: http://www.kongcompany.com/. Their toys are pretty much indestructible. I always have a chew toy, and a ""thinking"" toy out for Lola. The more toys you leave out, the less they'll chew on your stuff. BUT, dogs get bored. Buy like 10 good toys and keep them on rotation. Only 2 or 3 out at a time, and they change every few days. That keeps them interested. You'll notice if you leave a toy out for too long they'll stop playing with it. 

As far as playing, lay down some rules or the dog will be ape shit. I didn't realize this with Lola and she was a little she-devil for a while before I laid down the law. Don't let the pup bite your hands. You should be able to reach for/at your dog at any point without them biting you. They can ""mouth"" or gnaw, but if they bite your hands (or other body parts or clothing), even accidentally, stop playing and say no. They should only be biting toys.  If your dog does bite you and it bites too hard (means it didn't learn bite inhibition as a puppy) make sure you ""yelp"" and ignore. Basically, dogs learn bite inhibition (aka ""I can only bite so hard before it hurts them"") when they're puppies. Sometimes they don't learn it though (usually when they're taken away too young). So you have to act like its siblings or mother would to teach it. The pup's siblings would yelp and stop playing with the pup if it bit too hard. So if your pup bites you hard make a high pitched ""yeeep"" and then turn away for a minute or so. Dogs don't generally remember what they're being punished for after a minute, so don't extend it beyond that. Also, if the dog gets super hyper, stop playing. I thought it was cute when Lola got crazy excited. But excitement slowly turned into anxiety/aggression. Let your dog get all into it, but if it starts getting too excited and they look out of control, stop.

Oh, also, you'll want something you can freeze for your teething puppy. When the pup's teeth start falling out, it will want to chew on EVERYTHING. If you give it a cold frozen toy, the pup will chew on that because it will make their gums feel better. Also, don't leave the tug-of-war or tennis ball out. The dog will be far more interested in playing with these toys if they are reserved specifically for tug and fetch. Oh, and never ever ever buy your dog raw hide. Dogs can't digest raw hide. They just bite off pieces and those pieces pass through their system undigested. If your dog chews off too big of a piece, it can choke or cause intestinal blockage (which can kill it, worst case, or best case is REALLY FUCKING expensive). People have different opinions about this, but why risk it? Your dog don't care if it gets rawhide or a pb&amp;j stuffed Kong toy. Just for realz stay away from raw hide.

These things aren't necessary, but they will make your life MUCH easier down the road. Buy a tooth brush (finger brushes are easiest: http://www.petco.com/product/109252/Petco-Soft-Finger-Dog-Toothbrushes.aspx)  and a hair brush early on. It's really good to get them used to these things. They'll be MUCH easier to groom later on. If you buy a dog that sheds, Furminator brushes are magic (http://www.furminator.com/).

This is the list of things I bought for the pup when I fist adopted her: a crate (must be the right size for it to work for potty training), a clicker for training (http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2751377), Natures Miracle clean up spray, small treats for training, delicious treats for potty training (REAL meat or cheese), dog food, 2 dog bowls (buy this kind if your puppy eats way too fast: http://www.petsmart.com/search/index.jsp?kwCatId=&amp;kw=slow%20feed%20dog%20bowl&amp;origkw=slow+feed+dog+bowl&amp;sr=1&amp;f=PAD/psNotAvailInUS/No), poo bags, dog shampoo and wet wipes (for when it sits/walks in its own puppy diarrhea...WILL happen), finger toothbrush, foaming toothpaste (I like http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.jsp?productId=11888862&amp;f=PAD%2FpsNotAvailInUS%2FNo), furminator hair brush, 10 *puppy* toys (including one you can freeze), the Easy Walk dog harness, a collar (don't spend too much on the collar; you'll have to buy a bigger one in 6 months), a dog tag, and a sturdy 4 or 6 foot leash. Don't get too long of a leash. Also never ever ever get one of those extending leashes. It teaches the dog to be comfortable with tension on the leash. Once your dog is used to this, it's pretty damn difficult to get it to walk loose-leash.

About 6 months later I bought Lola: a collapsable water bowl for when we go on long walks or hikes, a dog bed for when she was fully potty trained, a tug-of-war, tennis balls, a frisbee, and a christmas sweater.

As far as feeding: don't buy off-brand kibble. That stuff is shit and your dog would never, ever encounter shit like that in the wild. If you feed it kibble, find the stuff that's as close to real food as possible. It may be more expensive, but you generally feed less of the nice kibble because it has more nutrients:mass. I cook for my dog now, but when I fed kibble I really liked Wellness and Blue Buffalo Wilderness. They're easy to find and not totally crap. This website rates dry dog food http://www.dogfoodadvisor.com/dog-food-reviews/dry/5-star/ and wet dog food: http://www.dogfoodadvisor.com/dog-food-reviews/dry/5-star/. Some people are all into raw food. My thought on this: your pup eats raw chicken. Then it kisses you in the mouth (you don't ask for this, but pup will deliver). That gives me the eebies. But, whatever you're into (salmonella). If anyone out there wants to cook for their pup, let me know and I'll send you my recipe. Whatever you do, don't feed your dog Science Diet. That stuff gave Lola the NASTIEST gas of all time. It was relentless.

She's spent more than the last week with terrible diarrhea and vomiting - we were able to diagnose that she has giardia but the meds she's on aren't doing much to help her. When I came home to a vomit covered house tonight and she refused to even go near her food (normally she's jumping for JOY at the smell/sight of food), I called our vet. They urged me to bring her in.

Now we're not sure what's wrong with her. They're keeping her over night to get her re-hydrated and to do a couple more tests to get a more definitive answer about what's going on. I am very scared, because things seem to be getting worse, not better. I have literally spent the last 3 hours in tears and devastation because I have no idea what's going to happen to her. She's only 1 and a half.  

I have very little money and I am more than willing to go broke to make sure she's okay but after that, there isn't much more that I can do. She's my best friend and everything to me - it breaks my heart right now to have such a quiet house. So please go hug your 4 legged friends and keep mine in your thoughts tonight.

He has a red nosed pitt/rhodesian ridgeback mix, and I have a boxer/plott hound mix. We live in an area highly populated with people from the middle east and every time we walk down to the park we pass many middle eastern people out walking. More often than not they jump out of the way of either dog in fear, more than a few of which will then shoot dirty looks. Both dogs are super sweet and want nothing more than a quick pat on the head and sniff before they'll move on.

Yesterday while walking the dogs down to the park my friend finally got fed up with the dirty looks, stopped a couple who jumped out of the dogs way and asked 

Friend - ""Why did you jump out of the dogs way?""

Guy - ""He looks dangerous. Pittbulls are known to be dangerous.""

Friend - ""All he did was turn his head to sniff in your direction, he showed no signs of aggression, both of them are super sweet dogs.""

Woman - ""Dogs of that breed are mean and attack unprovoked. How are we to know he's not trained to attack?""

Friend - ""Let me get this straight, you're profiling my dog because of his breed and appearance? Seriously?! How do you two feel at the airport when your treated the same way?""

Guy - ""I apologize. What are the dogs names?""

At which point they both approached the dogs and let them sniff and lick their hands before moving on. She even gave a little wave to them.

We got a few sightings of him about a week after he disappeared. Always near busy intersections, which made me sad and scared.  But today, while I was luckily on break, I got a phone call from a little kid.

Me: Hello?
Kid: do you have a dog?
Me: YES!

So my roommate picked him up from a house about two miles from us.  He's a little dehydrated, a little skinny, and has a superficial wound/rash on his leg, but he's home, and he's alive, and my future son will get to meet him!

I'm an illustrator by trade and occasionally find myself with a little free time and have been known to do dog caricatures in this time on a commissioned basis.

The images cost £6.50 (roughly $9.88) for a black and white sketch (slightly more for a coloured one) - [full info available here](http://kovahs.blogspot.co.uk/p/pet-caricatures_15.html) including a donation to a dog charity.

Colour are £8 (Roughly $12.17)

They are digitally done and I will email you a A5 sized print ready copy and a smaller internet friendly one.

I only take paypal for these.

If you are interested please drop me an email - katy@kovah.co.uk 

I will need several photos of your dog for reference and a little paragraph about your dog so I can get a sense of their personality.

Here are a couple of examples there are more on the link above:

[Jack](http://i.imgur.com/jPyaTjx)

[Tyson](http://i.imgur.com/7iPk5B2)

If this isn't allowed on /r/dogs I apologise but I couldn't find anything that said otherwise as they are not photos of my dog.


**EDIT:**

Thankyou to all those who have sent me an email I will get back to you asap!

For anyone yet to send me one, please include whether you want black and white or colour, pictures of your dog (preferably front and side at least) and a small paragraph about their personality and that I require payment via paypal before work is started and that prices listed are per dog/animal not per image.

**EDIT 2:**

Wow I had a lot more interest than I had anticipated, thank you all. I will get back to you all but please be aware it might be a day or two before I reply to your email but I will!

**EDIT 3:**

Just as there has been a little confusion with a few people Euros (EUR) are not the same as English Pounds £ (GBP), the prices are in **pounds** not Euros.
