Greetings!
Please call the Maine House today in support of LD 1229, ""An Act to Tax &amp; Regulate Marijuana"". The vote is imminent and we are very close to passing the minority report on the bill. In fact, two members of the Criminal Justice Committee have switched their votes and will be voting with us.
Maine House: (207) 287-1400
The minority report JUST sends the question to Maine voters this fall. If voters decide they want marijuana legal, the Legislature will develop the regulatory structure next session in an open, transparent and public process.
Thanks for all you do - we are very, VERY close right now!
Regards,

From what I gather, while she doesn't like privacy being invaded, she supports the NSA and says Snowden caused the most harm.  She also claims that the NSA/PRISM have stopped terrorist attacks, according to what Obama's team told her.

I normally get downvoted to hell in this sub, and I hate scandals like this, but this is for people to read that haven't read her viewpoint on the topic.  

(I know for a fact it's a generic automated response from the broken script that appeared instead of her signature.  In the real email the ""A"" is 3 times bigger than the font size from the rest of the message, and the .MERGE error is in red.)

_________________________

Thank you for contacting me about the National Security Agency's (NSA) information collection programs.  I appreciate your taking the time to do so.

I have noted your concern that the NSA programs recently divulged by Edward Snowden may have violated the privacy and civil liberties of la w-abiding American citizens.  I am a strong supporter of privacy and civil liberties, which  we  Americans value so greatly.  I also have long held the belief that it is a false choice that our nation must decide between security and liberty.   Working within the system of checks and balances envisioned by our Founding Fathers, I believe both goals can be accomplished with constant vigilance by Congress, by the courts, and by the people.

 

It is important to note that many of Mr. Snowden's assertions about NSA's information collection activities are  simply  false .     During a recent Senate Appropriations Committee hearing on  cybersecurity , I questioned General Keith Alexander, Director of the NSA and Commander of U.S. Cyber Command, about Mr. Snowden's claims that he could tap into virtually any Americ an's phone calls or e-mails.  General Alexander testified that those  claims were absolutely false.  

 

Throughout the world , there are terrorist networks and radicalized in dividuals that have no  goal  other  than to harm and kill Americans.   After the attacks of September 11, 2001, Congress recognized that our laws had not kept pace with the advances of technology, and that terrorists were able to use our laws against us.  To address these crucial issues, changes were made in  our laws.  These changes require con stant review and oversight.  A t my insistence , and that of many of my colleagues,  these laws   also include sunset provision s so that Congress must periodically reexamine them .

 

When former Senator Joe Lieberman and I drafted the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, we also included a Civil Liberties and Privacy Board to ensure that the robust authorities needed to protect Americans do not interfere with the f ree exercise of our liberties.     In the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), Congress created a special court to ensure  that intelligence activities conducted by the federal government comply with the Constitution and laws and appropriately protect privacy and civil liberties.

 

Judicial scrutiny, like that provided by the  FISA court , is a critical part of the oversight process and protection of privacy and civil liberties.   In fact, no federal agency can listen in on the content of a domestic phone call without a  court-issued  warrant based upon probable cause.  In addition, federal law prevents the NSA – or any other agency – from indiscriminately sifting through phone records.   With th e approval of the FISA court ,   t he database for the NSA program  consists of a collection of telephone numbers, times, and the duration of calls , but  not the content of the calls .  The collection of this  database is approved by the FISA court , and access to this database requires a so-called ""dirty number,"" which is a telephone number associated with a suspected foreign terrorist.

 

The other NSA program, which has been referred to as PRISM, is authorized under Section 702 of FISA to collect foreign intelligence information from electronic communication service providers.  Importantly, the program cannot be used to target an individual reasonably believed to be an American or someone who is located in the United States.  

 
According to  the Obama administration and  General Alexander, these programs have been effective.  They have been responsible for the detection and thwarting of at least 50 terrorist plots both in our country and abroad.   As Congress and the American public learn more about these programs, however, there remain ques tions and issues we must address.  I have strongly encouraged the Administration to reveal more information about these programs, including identifying actual plots that have been prevented because of th e existence of these programs.

 
As a Member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I have now been fully briefed on the NSA collection programs that were revealed by Edward Snowden.  Through my briefings, I have concluded that his disclosures have done tremendous harm to our  ability to detect and disrupt terrorist plots.  

 
Please be assured that I will continue  vigorous  oversight of the intelligence community's activities, and that I will continue to press the Administration to reveal as many facts about the NSA's programs as it can, without further compromising our national security.

 

Thank you again for contacting me about this important issue. EMAIL.BEGINHIDE.MERGE

 

Sincerely,

A 

Susan M. Collins

United States Senator

Just learned of it this evening. For years and years I've had this ""thing"" about your ""state"". I can't in good faith believe it exists. 

I'm open to it existing, truly, but every indicator points to its fairy tale-ness. 
#1 (anecdotal evidence): I've never met anyone from Maine. Everyone I've met that says they've been to Maine was either a) a child with an unreliable memory or b) a heavy substance abuser with an unreliable memory. 
#2 (case study): Many cultural exports from ""Maine"", including T-shirts and lobsters and shot glasses, are sold all over the New England area. Whose to say the fabrication of this ""state"" isn't an elaborate marketing ploy to move product? Sure, doesn't pass Occam's Razor, but just the same, there's not enough evidence one way or the other. 
#3 (qualitative survey): I've spent years touring all over the United States, in fact playing all 47 contiguous states multiple time. In all of those travels we have only had 1 SHOW booked in Maine and days before... It was cancelled by the promoter. Most of our tour mates have never been there either and the ones that ""have"" generally have no idea where they are on any given day. This relates back to point #1. 
#4: (the strongest point): Maine is the magical fairy tale land of excellent writers such as Stephen King and John Irving. The land of the Mist. The land of Pennywise. The land of Twisted River and Garp. A story land fabrication that has taken its place permanently among the collective conscience. 

And so I rest my case. I offer the floor to my awaiting opposition, ""You princes of Maine, kings of New England.""",,False,self,t5_2qts0,False,,,True,t3_1ahedc,http://www.reddit.com/r/Maine/comments/1ahedc/dont_believe_in_maine/,

**When is this awesome event happening?** Saturday July 21st!

**Who can attend?** This is an 18+ event. Under 21 will not be permitted to drink. This is on NinjaSupplyCompanys personal property so I am making rules to protect him from any repercussions and because it's the law. 

**What will we be doing??** Depending on how many people confirm - we can discuss having a cookout and a keg. If you're willing to bring something post here and let me know so I can make sure we have enough food and drinks for everyone.

**Where?** Off route 1 in Waldoboro (will post a reminder the week before and will pm people who want to attend the address)

**Why come to this event?** *Obligatory* Because fuck you that's why!  But really, why not? What better thing to do on a Saturday in July then chill out at a BBQ with a bunch of strangers?


We look forward to meeting some new people and having a kick ass weekend. 

~Ms_Muffette &amp;amp; NinjaSupplyCompany. Your friendly hosts of the first statewide r/maine meetup!

This summer I'm doing a Camp America-style programme, and I've been placed in Maine (near a town called Leeds, which happens to be where I'm from in the UK!). This consists of 8 weeks working at a summer camp, before being let loose to travel in mid August. Never been to the US before, so really looking forward to it!

Since I'll be starting in Maine, I was wondering if I could get any advice from you guys about what I absolutely cannot miss in your State? Anything local to you that's off the beaten track? Also, I was wondering if anyone could recommend anywhere cheap to stay, since I'm a 21 year old student so will be doing this on an extremely tight budget! Even something like a nod in the direction of your favourite place to eat would be appreciated.

So yeah, I'd be grateful for any tips or adice you have to offer.

I can't even begin to tell you how very much her thoughtfulness meant to me at the Newport Shop'n Save--but let me try.

If you live in the RSU 19 district, you probably know that we have a new superintendent. He arrived on July 1 to find that our previous superintendent had left us with a significant financial problem. Because district towns had been improperly billed for two consecutive years, we were in debt. Voters have twice turned down a request for a loan that would resolve the immediate problem. (The third vote is March 8.) Therefore, there has been a hold on ALL spending. That means no classroom supplies, no books, no field trips, no extracurricular activities, no afterschool support programs--unless funded by an outside donor. During the informational meetings to discuss the reasons for the financial issues as well as possible resolutions, teachers have taken a verbal beating. When this is coupled with the attacks from our Governor on the profession, it takes its toll.

The day before vacation began, I stood in line at Hannaford's, purchasing a cartful of snacks for students to take home with them over vacation. Behind me was a young mother, with a little girl who was quite struck with all that I was purchasing. ""That woman has a lot of applesauce, Momma!"" she commented. I heard the mom explain to her little girl that some children didn't have enough to eat.

As I unloaded my purchases in the parking lot, the young mother stopped by my car to tell me I had left something inside the store when I checked out. When I went back inside, I found that I hadn't left anything; rather, this woman had purchased a gift card and left it there for me. On the envelope, she had written, ""Thanks for all you do!"" 

I work with high school students, and there are so many who come to my room for snacks to supplement their meals at school. Many will leave our building at 3:00 and not have anything to eat until the next morning when they return to us. The budget issue has been difficult for our students, too. When the communities that they live in do not support the education of their children, we are all demoralized.

The day this mother stood behind me in line at Hannaford's, we had provided a school assembly to recognize the academic achievements of many of our students. Near the end of the assembly, our principal spoke candidly and commended our student body for rallying together in these difficult times, for remaining proud to be Nokomis Warriors. She told them how much she appreciated the teachers in the building, who continued to shield them from as much of the problem as possible in order to provide them with the opportunities that only an education can bring. Immediately, there was a smattering of applause, which swelled across the gym as our students stood and clapped for nearly five minutes in appreciation for their teachers. There were many of us--and many students--whose eyes were far from dry. I will never forget those moments.

And for this stranger to recognize and value the contributions that teachers make to the lives of our students was the ""cherry on top."" When I walked back into the store, a former student and a current student proudly gave me the gift certificate you purchased for me. They hugged me tightly and told me that people DO appreciate what we teachers do, and I drove home feeling the happiest I have felt in a very long time.

I told the story of the young mother's gift in the teachers' room the next morning, where my friends and colleagues listened with tears in their eyes and joy in their hearts.

---------------------------------------------------------------

My friend Jeremy is a fantastic, bright, clever, driven, funny guy. He works helping other people with spinal cord injuries and other mobility issues. I drive for him and help in other small ways. He's a quadriplegic, paralyzed since age 15, and he depends on an accessible environment. He recently met the love of his life, and in March, a home builder finished their new house. They moved in in April. This was life-changing for Jeremy--a flat floor that lets him get everywhere, unimpeded. Counters, appliances, and fixtures are mounted where he can reach them, and there's a shower that he can roll into. I cannot overstate how hugely needed these things are.

Now the problem: The builder *royally* screwed up in a few critical ways. (I can explain how, if you must know.) The immediate problem is that the house is DRENCHED. The concrete slab is saturated, vents, ceilings, and insulation are pouring wet. The heating was also installed improperly, and they're facing the possibility that the house may be uninhabitable come winter.

Yes, there are many concerns here, but right now we need to get the place as dry as possible.

 * They need to borrow dehumidifiers. Preferably big ones with a drain hose, but we're not picky. I've come up with a couple, but the right thing for the job is a high capacity industrial dehumidifier, which none of us can afford. I can schedule pick-ups Jeremy's van, and will return units when you need them back.

 * They need a *really* good lawyer who specializes in homeowner/builder contract disputes. They need to avoid some truly terrible potential outcomes, like being penniless and homeless.

If you want to determine that this isn't some ridiculous, elaborate scam, shoot me a note and I'll be happy to provide whatever ID/supporting documentation I can, as long as it can't interfere with forthcoming legal undertakings.

Thanks for reading.

If I had just rolled through that it would have been oh silly me I don't have the pass in the car. 

Nope I try to do the right thing, ACCIDENTALLY give incorrect change and get berated by the state trooper. He asks me in the most condescending tone, ""You know how to count, right? How old are you? You went to elementary school?"" I answer, ""Yup.""

""Middle school?"" He asks. 

""Yup."" I answer. 

Tone gets even more sarcastic. 

He asks me, ""High school?""

I say, ""Yes. Sir."" Being sure to enunciate each word loud and clear. 

He goes on with, ""Some college?!"" 

""That's correct officer, finished even."" I answer more quickly and coldly. 

He then let's me know he has no reason to believe that I made a mistake and was actively trying to rip the state off. I show him the multiple quarters, dimes and nickels at my disposal that can make this situation go away. He huffs and goes back to his car. For 15 MINUTES!

I knew there was no more discussion to be had with this man. He handed me my summons for ""theft by deception"" had me sign and asked if I had any questions. I asked what class crime this was and he told me it was a misdemeanor. He then told me I should be careful since toll took a pic of my license plate they could suspend my registration. 

TL;DR I made a mistake. My question I guess is do I call and file a complaint? He was super sarcastic, condescending and rude. Not interested in a dialogue and had mind made up before reaching my car. What would you do reddit?

* Print out pamphlets at the library and hand them out. The library charges just a few cents per page - hell, I'll even donate some cash to help pay for them. Put the pamphlets on the bulletin boards downtown and hand them out to pedestrians.

1372142389.0,26,self.Maine,1h0vet,So I got pulled over at 2am this morning in Brewer....On a bicycle.,bangorlol,32,6,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/Maine/comments/1h0vet/so_i_got_pulled_over_at_2am_this_morning_in/,"So there I was a mere 50 minutes prior to this posting in the middle of a programming session, adding the finishing touches to my latest site, when I thought ""Golly-gee, I sure could go for an iced coffee right about now!"".

**The problem:** It was ~1:50am, so I couldn't take the motorcycle without waking up everybody in the neighborhood and I don't have a car.


**The solution:** Take one of my bicycles, get a bit of a workout, and really *earn* that sweet, sweet iced coffee from Tim Hortons.


So I pedal my white ass the good mile or so to Tim Hortons, order my beverage, and leave the establishment with my order. As I'm pulling out of the parking lot I notice a Brewer PD SUV pulling up behind me with his turn signal on, so I do the ""good guy bicyclist"" thing and turn up on the sidewalk to let him by (which, according to the [Maine DOT site](http://www.maine.gov/mdot/bikeped/safety/laws.shtml) is legal, and Brewer's City Ordinance has no mention of it being illegal from what I read).


So naturally the guy turns on his lights, pulls me over, and asks for my ID. After a good 5-10 minutes of him bitching at me while I stand there (and running my info which came up with nothing), sipping on my delicious coffee, he lets me go.

* * *

**TL;DR;**: Got pulled over on my bicycle, cop wanted to run my info because I look like a sketchball (ask /u/neuromonkey/ ), told me riding a bike on a sidewalk is illegal. 


Normally I'm not one to make a big stink about stuff like this, but for future reference can anybody tell me if the city of Brewer's ordinances actually disallow sidewalk riding (especially at 2am when there is no foot traffic)?

I have a lovely lady, justchristen, who is offering some private property up near Sugarloaf for the next meetup. This will be a weekend event. 

OR- This is what we are thinking is the better bet. There is a place that we can rent in Rangeley, it may be like $20 a person but you have a bunk, running water and it's totally chill. The thing is with this, is we may have to pay in advance so I would be collecting $$ from people who want to go to reserve a spot and I will be keeping a ""Guest List"" of all who have paid. (I don't want to get screwed out of $$ if I throw down for 30+ ppl and 15 show) The $$ you pay will go toward your bunk. We are allowed to BYOB and Food. 

We are thinking August 24-26  OR August 31-September 2 (Labor Day Weekend)

If any of you have any other options (I don't want to abuse NinjaSupplyCompanys kindness) or ideas on what we should do, let me know!

If anyone could go there, scope out the scene and possibly take some photos I would really appreciate it. I live in Portland, OR at the moment and I don't know anyone in Augusta which is why I'm throwing the feelers out here on Reddit. This would save me and my housemate a lot of time and money, if someone is more interested feel free to send me a PM. Reddit Gold? A pizza? :-)

We had a LAN in town with 4 pc gamers, 2 360 gamers and a bunch of fun, but it wasnt very big. I joined the local colleges gaming club but they did nothing, no emails at all. 

So to get to the point... I'm from the UK and would love to get a big LAN going. I miss Multiplay :P

All those in favor ?

Edit: I just wanted to update this original post by thanking everyone for the comments and show of interest, It's clear we could get an event up and running and have a pretty good turnout if it's located in either Portland or Augusta areas. I'm leaning towards Portland given its size and venue choices.
I'd like to mention our facebook page https://www.facebook.com/Ground.Zero.Party
If you have an interest, please god like the page so we can let everyone know whats going on and we can ask questions to everyone who matters.
These events are all about the people. I could invest thousands in kit, gear and venue but without people it'd blow. Hard.

I look in my rear view and see some guy on his bike and notice 2 of his friends next to him. His friends were laughing and he just rode off like a butt head.. Had I not been stuck in traffic I would have pulled over when I saw him and his friends outside of MECA.

Well, I don't use the trunk much but I was putting groceries away yesterday and noticed yellow paint on the right corner of the bumper and it is skuffed where he hit it. (Yes I know it was from that because no other yellow bike or object has hit the car) I tried to rub the paint but it wouldn't come off :\  

If it were car that hit another car they would have to stop. Just because you're on a bike doesn't mean you shouldn't at least apologies and let ME check for damages.

The circumstances would have to be pretty extreme for me to throw any kind of fit in public, yet I've seen these performances on a regular basis in the five years I've lived in Bangor. As I write this, right outside there's a young woman crying and yelling at a hapless, guilty-looking oaf. She's sobbing more than most, and sounds more sincerely hurt than usual, but it's been going on for ~15 minutes.

I guess my question is this: WHAT THE FUCK, MAINERS? WHAT THE FUCKING ACTUAL FUCK? I am truley sorry for your lots and all that, but this has long ago transcended ""broken record,"" and is now, unfortunately, what I've come to consider fairly normal behavior for early-20-something Bangor couples.

I have never, ever before in my life felt like a superior, elitist douche. Am I being a callous shit? I grew up on subsidized school lunches, living in basement apartments--no silver spoons at my house--but since living in Bangor, I am realizing that I came from a very different cultural environment.

At any rate, please take your tedious screaming fit home, with all the doors closed, or I swear to fucking god I'm going to totally lose my shit all over you. Well. No, I'm not. But I am getting tired of this routine.

*EDIT:* Since posting, 4 days ago, I've seen/heard two more of these screaming matches on my street. The most recent just passed (blissfully,) out of earshot. Not that I have anything against the word, ""fuck,"" but--every third word? It dilutes its potency, and spoils ""fuck"" for everyone. How about ""shitcock,"" ""cuntface,"" ""dribbletits,"" or ""fanny?""

While I don't think Portland could support a huge number of food trucks, I still think this foodie town could do with a few.

I already told him I'm not playing ""Psycho Roommate Roulette"" and I'm not living in the Drug Den Arms Slum Apartments, admittedly I know little about the area, but I'm from northern maine and a major recluse so everything south of Bangor scares the hell out of me.

Basicly I need to know what the cost of living is for a single male aged 28 in Auburn, costs include:

Rent  ---   The place I'll be working at is just off Hotel road he said.
Phone  ---  Never had a cell phone before but will need one for work, landline will be optional unless needed for reliable internet.
Internet  --- gonna need it, part of my job is going to be logging into a site everyday to check on things
Power  ---  I'm probably going to be running at least 1 computer 16+ hours a day, some of the work I'll be doing I will be doing from home.
Heat  ---  Most big apartment buildings (I'm told) have shared heat so this may not be an issue.
TV  ---  I can live without it, barely anything worth watching on it anyway
Food  ---  This probably wouldn't change much though

I only ask because my ability to run a google search has apparently died lately I can't find anything more recent then 2010, and even then I can't get the same answer from more then 1 source.

Any help people can give would be much appreciated.  ",,False,self,t5_2qts0,False,,,True,t3_16jud9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Maine/comments/16jud9/moving_to_auburn_need_some_information_first/,

Want to learn software hacking?,k0ss_sec,20,5,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Maine/comments/x3a9x/near_bangor_want_to_learn_software_hacking/,"There is currently a meetup called the ""Hacker Club"" that meets bi-weekly in Bangor at the BAM bookstore.  It's primarily made up of web programmers and gadget enthusiasts who want to collaborate and make cool apps, but I'll either steer it in the direction of teaching security and making security applications, which most of the members seem ok with, or more likely start another meetup for this which meets on-campus and includes more students.

The [need for computer security experts](http://security.blogs.cnn.com/2012/04/21/feds-need-more-computer-defense-experts-napolitano-says/) is only [becoming more obvious](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/13/us-media-tech-summit-symantec-idUSBRE85B1E220120613).  If you're already a programmer either for websites or writing your own software, knowing how to program securely will be an asset to your company.  Furthermore, developing the mindset of ""how would someone abuse this code?"" will lead you to naturally create more secure programs, which is what I will mostly focus on.

**Today** 

We will go over the basic blunders of insecure software, such as stack overflows.  I'll explain how the stack works, what sorts of functions are typically used insecurely in C, and how an attacker can turn an application crash into total control over a computer, as well as basics on mitigating this threat, if we have time.

So. are there any Maine redditors who want to dip their feet into basic software hacking?

First I checked for all the posts on reddit that are linking to exceptionmag.com. I honestly didn't expect to see much - I was wrong. There are TONS of posts, posted by obviously fake accounts (usernames: rkjf02ja and the like). Don't believe me? [Check it out for yourself](http://www.reddit.com/domain/exceptionmag.com/).

The next thing I did was checked the domains alexa rank - and was kind of shocked at what I found.

The owner of exceptionmag.com - R. Stefan Deeran - has either carried out or paid someone to spam backlinks EVERYWHERE to boost his page rank for SEO (search engine optimization) - obviously looking for profit.

Again, if you don't believe me, [look here](http://www.alexa.com/site/linksin/exceptionmag.com).



Normally I'd let this kind of thing slide since I myself am a marketer, however spamming on *our* subreddit (and blasting backlinks on tons of blogs and forums with spam software) for pagerank and eventually making a decent profit by taking advantage of **local** people who are just trying to be informed isn't my cup of tea.

I'm not trying to launch a smear campaign against them, I just figured I'd like you guys know what was happening. I understand the articles are relevant to this subreddit, however I don't like the methods being used for their SEO.

Right now, the plan is to head into Maine at Fort Kent, and take Route 161 south to New Sweden/Stockholm, to see the Swedish Colony.  Then we'll head back out along Route 1, and cross the river back to New Brunswick at Van Buren.  (A friend has recommended a stop at Loring AFB to check out the runway there; is this still good advice?  Can cars access the runway?)

Has anyone ever taken this route?  Are the Swedish historical sites worth seeing, and what else is there?  Would I be better to take Route 1 along the river, and, if so, what's to do there?

I'm also considering the possibility of coming into Maine at Pohénégamook/Estcourt Station/Big 20 instead, and following the private road network south into Fort Kent.  Does anyone have any experience with these roads?  Is this worth doing?

On top of all that, there's a bit of flexibility in terms of other detours around far northern Maine; is there anything else you'd recommend?

Overall, I'm interested in unusual or kitschy roadside attractions, good food, and great views.
