I wanted to put together a starting guide for men who are in-confident, or don't know where to start.

For men, I believe in the three F's:

**1. Fashion**

**2. Fitness**

**3. Flirting**

I think if a man can get these bases covered, that he'll feel great, look great, and be appreciated by women (and men) around him. Just a caveat: this guide is not for men who are especially strong in either one of these areas; it's for beginners who might not have considered the following:

---------


**1. Fashion**

* **Subscribe to /r/malefashionadvice. Check out the side bar for basics, or [click here](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/12gfbv/the_basic_wardobe_40/)**

Fashion might make some men feel uncomfortable or indifferent, but a real man dresses like a real man. We all know how important first impressions are and dressing well and appropriate to the context will improve your interactions with everyone, and people will take you seriously. 

In business, fashion lends to you being a serious candidate.

In dating, fashion will improve your first impressions with women. Also remember, just like you want a beautiful lady on your arm, your lady will want to be proud of her man; make her proud.

Some pointers: (*These are general pointers. Obviously if everyone followed them to the T, we'd all look exactly the same. The point is to get a good foundation for fashion, then express yourself. Also, dress age-conciously. If you are a 18 year-old drummer in a band, or a 35 year-old tech start-up CEO, you can dress accordingly. Check out /r/malefashionadvice for more information.*)

* **Glasses**: Something like [wayfarer style](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l3nqqnrUhv1qb7unno1_500.jpg) are timeless and quite in fashion right now. If you're wearing something [like these](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_JBV6BhHmdZA/TYhPZIV8EXI/AAAAAAAAAFg/P8ujv6rZ3Z4/photo.JPG), then I'd suggest getting new frames (unless it *really* works for you [it probably doesn't]). Long rectangle frames, and especially thin-framed glasses are *really* hard to pull off without looking like a teenager from 1998.

* **Basics**: Get some solid color and [plaid button up long sleeve shirts](http://www.gap.com/products/res/mainimg/flannel-plaid-shirt-comet-blue.jpg). Get some straight leg, well fitting (slimmer) dark jeans or chinos (aka khakis). Get some Converse chuck taylor all-stars / leather boots, and you have an outfit. Undershirts worn with a button-up should be v-neck (unless like in the picture the undershirt is consciously part of the outfit); unbutton the top two buttons and show your neck / top of your chest. **This section is called basics because it's basic; you won't turn necks as soon as you walk in the door, but it's a safe, clean start; just make sure everything *fits* (probably relatively thin compared to what you might normally wear if you're new to fashion).** Hang your jeans for a day after wearing them to keep them fresh. Generally, you can wear jeans quite a while between washes if you air them out each time (given that you're not sweating excessively or getting sauce / dirt on them).

* **Fit**: Fit is king. All of the fabric should more-or-less be touching your body. [Look at the difference a nice (probably would you'd consider ""tight"") fit does.](http://finestitch.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/what-a-difference-a-tailored-suit-makes.jpg).

* **Accessorize**: Watch, belt, tattoo, facial hair, piercing, hat (*no fedoras*), etc. Once you get the basics down, start personalizing and expressing yourself

* **Haircut**: In general, a great place to start with hair is short on the sides (half an inch) and longer on the top (~2 inches). You can do different styles with this haircut depending on your personality, mood, or event context. Get some *good* gel or wax. You can style it [spikey](http://www.hairstylesforguys.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/2012-2013-Hairstyles-For-Guys-Mens-31.jpg) although this is admittedly going a bit out of style these days, or like the previous glasses picture: swept up and back (a more classic look; especially recommended for men over 25).

* **Acne**: This is personal preference, but I've found [Clean &amp; Clear facial foaming cleanser](http://www.westfield.com.au/au/retailers/pharmacy-online/products/clean-clear-foaming-facial-cleanser-150ml~495921) to be best. I used to have acne quite bad but swear by this product now. If you're embarassed to purchase it at the store, have a friend buy it for you or order it online and have it shipped to you. Some people say moisturize / toner / exfoliate, but I personally don't really do those things daily (only when really necessary). I just use this clean &amp; clear and have been fine.

* **Grooming**^4: Finger &amp; toe nails should be short (not much white showing). Scrub under them when you shower / wash your hands. Avoid athelete's foot by using products. Let shoes air out at least a day after wearing them (you should cycle in a few pairs of shoes, ideally). 

* **Socks &amp; Underpants**: One day for one pair of socks; no more. I personally recommend [No-show socks](http://www.target.com/p/hanes-premium-white-men-s-socks-10p-no-show-6-12/-/A-14126683#prodSlot=large_1_8). If you're wearing long tube socks, consider changing, soon. Get long thin black socks for dark / more formal outfits. Underpants: I'd suggest boxers or boxer-briefs (unless you need functional underwear for certain activities). Don't get them *too large*.

-----------

**2. Fitness**

* **Subscribe to /r/weightroom. Check out the side bar or [click here to get started.](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/weightroom#StarterPrograms)**

Start lifting. No matter what your goals are (fat loss, muscle bulk, marathon running), lifting will help dramatically. 

I personally suggest starting with this:

* [Stronglifts 5x5](http://stronglifts.com/) - It's a free program, it's an easy program, it's fast, and you track your success every day you lift.

I'd actually suggest purchasing **Starting Strength (Read Starting Strength, Practical Programming, and do the fucking program)**^3, but just for ease of access, I'd recommend signing up at stronglifts, downloading the PDF and getting started tomorrow.

The idea is simple. You do compound lifts that work many muscles at once. If you can do **5 sets of 5 reps** with a weight (*always start with the empty bar to get your form down*), **add a tiny bit more next time** (5lbs / 2.5kg). If you can do 5x5 of that weight, add more next time. If you can't do 5x5, do the same weight next time. If you fail 2 more times (so, a total of 3 days on the same weight), drop the weight by 10lbs / 5kg next time.

You only end up doing 3 lifts a session, so you're in and out in 30 minutes if you focus. Simple. Get ""Lift-big"" on Android, or ""Stronglifts (official)"" for iPhone. Log your reps and weight in the gym with you.

Keep your calorie intake lower ~~unless you're quite low fat % and want to start bulking~~ **if you are overweight or are skinny-fat and want to get rid of flab before bulking up. If you want to get muscularly bigger, you need to eat over your daily caloric requirement. Either way you need to eat enough to recover.**^3  This basically means find your daily caloric requirement (roughly 15 * your lbs.) and:

* Lots of meat - If you don't / can't, I'd suggest supplementing with WPH / whey protein powder

* Lots of veggies - Also I suggest supplementing with One-A-Day men's health formula vitamins if necessary

* Fatty foods are ay-okay - just make sure your total calories aren't too high (if you're trying to slim down)

* **If you want to lose weight**^3 Avoid carbs except on lift days. Consider carbs (pasta, bread, rice, sugary drinks) as simply sugar. They are very calorie dense and don't add much nutritional value. You don't need to [eliminate all carbs (although this is a good way to lose weight, aka Ketosis / ""Atkins"" diet)](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto), but simply consciously limiting them is a great way to lose fat. **Otherwise eat yer carbs to keep your calories up, especially on lift days .**^3

--------

**3. Flirting**

* **Purchase [""Models: Attract women through honesty""](http://www.amazon.com/Models-Attract-Women-Through-Honesty/dp/1463750358) via Amazon Kindle app for your smartphone/computer right now. Start reading.** (or buy a physical copy. I suggest digital so you don't stall or forget; get it now)

If you're a 25, 35, or 45 year old virgin, help is on the way! 

First off, like I said, get that book. Don't get a ""pick-up"" book. Get this one, it'll open your eyes and help you genuinely improve; it's honest and genuine. ""Pick-up"" books are, in my opinion, band-aid short-term solutions that are complicated and a bit unnecessary. Here are some of the bigger points from *Models*:

* **Be non-needy** - Don't be needy. Don't be so invested in what a girl thinks of you. I'm *not* saying to be a douche or ""alpha male."" But if you approach a girl totally invested in her opinion and holding your breath hoping for a good answer: you're being needy (and probably creepy). Instead approach a girl with the idea of ""*I wonder if she's interesting*"" instead of ""*I wonder if she'll like me*"".

* **Be vulnerable** - Don't take the safe, non-controversial route. Show your vulnerability and embrace it. Understand that you won't always succeed when you're vulnerable; that's actually the *definition* of being vulnerable. Girls pick up on this; girls can sense intent in a way most men can't. Be true to your intentions, show that you're okay with being vulnerable, and she'll be impressed (and relieved) by you. **Be genuine. Take risks you might not have before, but don't just do it for sake of doing it; do it if you like her and are connecting with her. Don't do it just to ""go out and game tonight"" or something.**^2

What do we mean by being vulnerable? Here are some examples:

1. Walking up to a girl to introduce yourself. - You risk rejection. By simply going up and saying ""Hi! My name's billy. I saw you chilling out and just *had* to introduce myself"", you are true to your intentions (she knows why you're here; don't pretend like you want a female opinion on blah blah blah), and you are happily revealing your vulnerability, and conquering it.

2. Grabbing a girl by the hand and bringing her to the bar - You risk rejection or coming on too strong. **You'd only do this after getting to know her a bit and knowing that she's interested in you as well as you genuinely being interested in her.**^1

3. Jumping on the stage to dance with your silly buddies - You risk looking stupid or losing social standing

4. Teasing her about her cute little nose - You risk her being offended or not liking you anymore. This also shows non-neediness

5. Standing your ground and disagreeing with her about something you genuinely disagree about - You risk her not liking you. Don't be a dick about it, but being 100% agreeable isn't that great either (and it's not genuine)

6. Playfully smacking her butt / twirling her / lifting her up - You risk coming on too strong, too physical, too much. But it shows that you're comfortable with yourself, you're not needy, and you embrace your sexuality (and it's just plain fun) **You'd only do these after getting to know her a bit and knowing that she's interested in you as well as you genuinely being interested in her.**^1

Make an emotional connection; learn how to converse. If you find you have awkward silences in your conversation, learn to thread your conversation. (e.g. Her: ""I lived in France for a year at cooking school."" You can talk about travel, language, independance, cuisine, school, learning). Connect emotionally, be physical.

Again, read that book, you won't regret it.

1373723772.0,392,self.amiugly,1i7txz,Why teenagers should not be posting on this subreddit.,archaicmosaic,506,114,88,http://www.reddit.com/r/amiugly/comments/1i7txz/why_teenagers_should_not_be_posting_on_this/,"I have two big concerns about teenagers posting on this subreddit. 

Concern #1

When you go through puberty as a teenager, your body changes very rapidly from one thing (a child) to another (an adult). At exactly the same time this happens, your brain is also changing from being a child to an adult. As a teenager, you are stuck in the weird limbo of being physically and mentally in a state of constant flux. This is why being a teenager is so painful. You are in the midst of an identity crisis. As your body and mind are both changing, your perception of yourself is also changing. As you start getting more interested in what your peers and members of the opposite sex think of you, you start getting way more obsessed with your own appearance. 

Take me for example.

When I was a teenager, I won the trifecta of awkward. I had pimples, I had braces, and I was chubby. Yay. Now apart from taking care of my skin and going on the pill, waiting, and growing a bit more while going to the gym and eating healthily, there just wasn't a whole lot I could do about my appearance at the time. Also, as a teenager, I had little to no control over my financial situation, and therefore little to no say over what I wore (which is probably for the best, because I had NO taste). Being a teenager was very difficult. It's difficult for everybody. Every comment anyone made about me and my appearance resonated in my mind for hours, days and even weeks after it was said. Even after I'd grown up and slimmed down, I still felt like I was really fat. Even after my skin started to clear up, I still felt like I was hideous. 

However!

I look back at photos of myself now, and I really didn't look that bad. A bit awkward and ungainly, but hey! What teenager doesn't?

Here are some before/after pics of me so you can see what I mean:

Me circa age 16, dodgy skin, braces so awkward smile: http://imgur.com/TFJpTjJ

Me age 22, minimal makeup: http://imgur.com/bX3Sm3W

Me, also aged 22, at a model shoot: http://imgur.com/jNHFlP7

Anyway, my point is that when I was 16 I actually had no idea of what I really looked like. The person I saw in the mirror was distorted, and I could only see my flaws, and the person I saw in my mind's eye was even more so. This is the same for all teenagers! Your body is going through so many physical and mental changes right now that you really are not in any good position to know what you look like. So, you shouldn't worry about it so much! Also, be comforted that everyone comes out the other end of puberty as an adult, and eventually you will settle into your new body and feel comfortable in it, and find your own style and way of self expression. So you really shouldn't be asking people on reddit ""Am I ugly?"" because your face and body are still changing and reddit will not know what the end result will be!

So don't worry so much about it!

Concern #2 will not be so long. 

My second concern goes out to all the redditors giving criticism (constructive or otherwise) to teenagers. These kids are at a very delicate age, and are very fixated on their own appearances. Telling them that they are ugly, or that they should change things about themselves, is reinforcing a message that their appearance is the most important thing about them (even if that is not the poster's intention). My grandfather once made an offhand remark to my older sister about her ""puppy fat"" when she was about 12. She's 30 now, she still struggles to manage her eating disorder. 

Kids at this age should be encouraged to spend more time focusing on their futures, and EVERYONE should know that unless you're Heidi Klum, your appearance is NOT your future. Your qualifications, your skills, your experience, your education: THAT is your future. 

TL;DR

1. You never look as bad as a teenager as you think you do.
2. Everyone grows up and finds their own style, so be patient, you'll get there. 
3. Don't give teenagers feedback about their appearance. It's reinforcing messages that their looks are the most important thing about them, when everyone knows good looks fade and don't make a living.

Anyway, please read this stuff about the subreddit so that it doesn't become a terrible place:

**Commenters:**

1. This isn't a rateme sub. That would be /r/rateme. Here it's encouraged to give advice and details along with your opinions, and single numbers like ""3/10"" will be removed, as will ""would hit it"", and ""yes, ugly"". You gotta write something.

2. We don't question peoples' motives here as long as they're not posting excessively (more than once a month without any major changes). Please don't accuse people of using the sub as a hugbox just because they're attractive.

3. Anything that looks like personal information digging gets you a ban and reported to the admins.

4. Be honest but have some tact. Don't be a dick. Stay classy. (Telling people about how you're touching yourself isn't classy.)

**Submitters:**

1. No nudes. Keep it SFW.

2. Don't post pictures that aren't of you. That means none of your girlfriend, because protecting folks' privacy is important. She needs to post her own pictures. And, if posting your own, try to keep other people out of them, again because of privacy but also because it can get confusing for commenters.

7. Better photos get better feedback. Try to take them at arms' length away, not in a mirror, and not with your face obscured by an object or stupid grimace.

6. Don't use Facebook or photobucket as a photo host. They're insecure and can be used to stalk you. Posts using them get removed for your safety.

4. Don't use this place as a hugbox. There's no way for us to tell, so, if you're gonna you're gonna, but please, if you just want someone to make you feel better, try [/r/mmfb](/r/mmfb) which is designed for exactly that purpose (and would love to have you)!

8. [Edit your thread to remove the photos afterwards.](http://www.reddit.com/r/amiugly/comments/ptvuc/how_to_delete_your_postphotos_from_ramiugly/) Don't delete the post, because that will leave the photos up.

3. Don't post more than like, once a month, unless you've seriously done something different. Don't repost at all unless you've changed or got very little feedback the first time.

5. If you want to talk about the subreddit, message the mods, because odds are everyone's heard it before, and we're the only ones who are going to change anything anyway. **OR** post it in one of the **new** weekly meta megathreads! Unconstructive meta-posts like ""everyone here is pretty what the fuck"" and ""you're all attention whores"" just get removed.


That's it. If you need a reminder about anything, or want to know about other related subreddits, check our obscenely long sidebar.

Given that I've been commenting on a lot of posts here, I figured it's only fair to put myself on the chopping block. 

As a self critique, I would say that I have an average face on an above average body, but it isn't for me to judge now. ^_^

Feel free to be brutally honest. 

I'm 6'2ish. In the picture next to Jim Morrison's grave, I was around 260 pounds. Took me about 6 months to get down to 170ish, and then another few months to bounce up to 200 (Which is where I'm at now). 


Changing so much has really changed what I want to do in life. I'm a CS student, but it'd be really cool to be a personal trainer.

I'd always had long hair and never bothered to wear my glasses because they were ugly, or nice clothes because nothing fit me. So once I lost the weight I decided to do a total body makeover.

First, please don't hate me for this, if you think my idea sucks, be nice about it lol.  
Anyways, i think it would be great it people who are rating also put up a picture of themselves (if they feel comfortable of course). I think this will really help the person asking see who finds them attractive or not attractive. We know everyone has their opinions, and certain types of people find certain looks attractive and others not. Also, it might be good to know how attractive you think the person rating you is. For example, if someone who i thought was attractive and out of my league said i was attractive, i would know that I'm not necessarily out of their league.  
So what do you think of this idea. Not saying every reply has to put their picture, just those that feel comfortable/ want to. Is it stupid or somewhat a good idea?

When you post, remember to save the Imgur deletion urls (addresses) of the photos you uploaded (or make an Imgur account before you upload those photos so that you don't have to), and then use them to delete your photos when you're done. If you forgot to do that, then copy the photo urls and include those addresses in an [Imgur removal request](http://imgur.com/removalrequest) (or the equivalent if your photos are not imgur-hosted). 

2. Then edit your post to remove the links. 

3. Then delete your post, and your comments on that post.

Don't just remove the photos and leave the post up, it annoys some people enough that they freak out and spam mod mail. Don't hit delete on the post without editing out the urls because it'll look to you like people can still view them, and you'll freak out and spam mod mail. And don't edit out the urls without getting them unhosted because people might still link to them in the comments, and again you'll freak out and spam mod mail.

Even if you do all this right, your photos still may be somewhere else on the internet or on someone else's computer forever.

Good morning! We were raided by /b/ last night. If you received nasty criticism or harassment or saw some things you can't unsee, that was the raid, so don't sweat it. The reddit was set to private twice, the second time for about two hours, apologies for that interruption in your regularly scheduled programming. I banned 190 accounts, and there might have been a few friendly-fire bans, so if you think you were banned in error please message the mods. 

While we're no longer being raided, we could be again whenever. We've got a lot of insecure people in one place so we're a ripe target. If all the comments suddenly seem to be the shittiest, laziest ""trolling"" you've ever seen, don't take them seriously, but do message the mods and let us know what's up. That said, we might have also picked up some better trolls that have a more long-term strategy, so keep an eye out.

You can skip this next part if you want, it's just a recap of last night's fun:

----------------------------

I didn't come online until 12AM pacific time, about an hour into the raid, and it was pretty bad. At the top of the subreddit was a post made by some /b/tard blaming 9gag for the raid. This was not true, we were actually raided by /b/. I set /r/amiugly and /r/amisexy to private, and enlisted my friend Alexor as a moderator to clear the reports queue, which was filled with gore and vitriol. Thanks for hitting the report button on those nasty posts, folks, it does help. 

I was watching the [/b/ thread](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6036313/athreadofourown.zip)[NSFW, download] and saw that the raiders were moving on to /r/suicidewatch, and I felt they could cause more harm there than here, so I reopened /r/amiugly to divert them. Sorry about that, I was just trying to minimize harm to everyone, after messaging the /r/suicidewatch mods and the reddit admins to no response. We successfully drew their attention from /r/suicidewatch, which they never raided to any large degree. 

Having had most of their accounts banned from /r/amiugly, they aimed at /r/aww. At this point I set /r/amiugly to private again and started combing the comments removing and banning the stragglers. They went at /r/srswomen, and /r/subredditdrama before losing interest. The /b/ thread died. Alexor cleaned the entire report queue (thanks Alexor!), I spent an hour removing and banning from the comments queue and cleaned it all up. At 4am, everything was as it had been and I reopened the subreddit.

-----------------------------

As with all meta-megathreads, if you have anything to say about the subreddit in general please post it here, even if it's completely unrelated to what I said above.  For me, I'm wondering whether the quality of comments has declined and what approach would be appropriate to bring it back up again, and I also have been wondering about continuing the megathread series with some little essays from you folks, and from guest writers, on attractiveness and related topics and stuff.

**[Last time on /r/amiugly...](http://www.reddit.com/r/amiugly/comments/qmd8d/meta_megathread_1_lets_talk_about_ugliness/)** we tried to talk about definitions of attractiveness and ugliness, and got some good responses. People talked about physical measures, like facial symmetry and proportions (the [golden ratio](http://plus.maths.org/content/os/issue22/features/golden/index)), body weight, hygiene, genetics, [similarity to the average](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koinophilia), and hair length. Also proposed were more subjective properties like one's attitude, aesthetic, confidence, self-awareness, world-knowledge, and personality. However, we didn't get very far on that topic because another more pressing issue came up: age.

**Many of our submitters are underage,** as was pointed out astutely by a lot of you. I don't have a statistics bot set up yet, but it's safe to say there are a lot of 16-year-olds and even some 14-year-olds. This makes many of us feel uncomfortable, including me. Folks said we should have a referendum on whether to restrict the subreddit to users 18 or older. We may yet do that. 

But first, I think it is important that we think about why we are bothered by it, and what arguments there are for prohibiting minors. A short list of reasons already proposed:

* teenagers are fragile and this experience may harm them
* teens are not done growing so any judgement is bound to be inaccurate
* teens are vain/shallow as it is and this will only exacerbate that
* teens may have serious psychological disorders (anorexia, suicidal ideation) and this will only exacerbate them
* teens are idiotic and they shit up the place
* teens are many and have a lot of free time and clog up the place
* teens are generally just looking for attention
* teen insecurity will pass naturally (and thus doesn't need /r/amiugly's help)
* it's creepy for any adults to talk about teens being attractive in any context including this one
* this forum could attract pedophiles and aid them in doing bad things
* teens should be doing their homework anyway

Pretty damning. 

[I made some arguments against prohibition.](http://www.reddit.com/r/amiugly/comments/qmd8d/meta_megathread_1_lets_talk_about_ugliness/c3z828y) Summarized:

* teens are already anxious about their looks. we can help quell that anxiety so that they can worry about other actually important things
* we can't practically enforce an age restriction
* if this place becomes age-restricted, teens will only go elsewhere for the same product and everywhere else is worse
* while they are here we can challenge their concern with looks and engage them about it

And that's where we left off. This is the main topic of this thread, so discuss away. Mods read all of your feedback and use it to make decisions about the subreddit.

-----------------------------------

Other minor business:

The sidebar is hella long and unwieldy, and while I think all the rules it contains are essential, the current method of presentation leaves a lot to be desired. So I'm proposing two things: that we add in one of Blackstar9000's [CSS vote faders](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/r5clp/vote_fader_ver_4/), and that instead of the rules inline we have an eye-catching advertisement-like image that hotlinks to another image which is an illustrated version of the rules. (If any of you have talent and want to make either of these it'd be much appreciated.) While usually I like to have rules right there on every page, in this case there's so many that I think a lot of folks' brains just shut off, and it'd be cool to experiment with the whole rule infographic kind of thing anyway. We're also going to get megathreads stickied to the top of the page with CSS, hopefully.

We're thinking about adding a new moderator: [RichardBachman](http://www.reddit.com/user/richardbachman). If any of you have any reasons why he and [/r/amiugly](/r/amiugly) shouldn't be joined in holy moderatory speak now or forever hold your peace.

Also if you have any suggestions for a subject for the next thread, I'm all ears. And if you come to this megathread from some other subreddit please say so, so that it's clear what input is coming from within and what from without.

Every month we get a couple of meta posts talking about how everyone here is pretty, or everyone here is ugly, or everyone here should be less shallow, or everyone here is really bad at judging what everyone here is. And we mods have been removing them because they're crap. They aren't interesting, they lead to no interesting discussion, and generally they're made by people who have been here all of fifteen minutes. And they take up space.

But at the same time, there are issues with this subreddit that deserve discussion, if not change. Moral issues. Every day some hundred people come in and post threads here, many of them underaged, and are sent out the door having been judged by a small group of people based solely on their looks. Is that right?

I think that, for us to better feel that this subreddit is doing good, and not just exacerbating our already image-obsessed culture, we do need to at least discuss some things, together. But, so that it doesn't get out of hand, it's going to be in one weekly megathread, so it's easily ignored if it's not what your interested in.

Now, I have some ideas about things I'd like to see discussed, but I'm sure you do too. So let's try to answer three things with this thread:

1. What is ugliness? What do you look for as far as attractiveness? Is it all looks?

2. What should the next megathread be about? 

3. Any other questions or concerns about this whole megathread thing.

Ok go.

Oh and one rule, if you came to this thread from some other subreddit, could you please say where you came from, so that it's easier to keep track of what's coming from inside the subreddit and what's from without.

Ok now go.

The most common explanation is that you are so used to seeing the mirror image of your face that when you see yourself in a picture, your face appears distorted because asymmetricalities are amplified. There is however another big factor, and this one is not just in your head: [perspective distortion](http://i.imgur.com/c0wXVaX.jpg). All of those pictures are of the same woman, but taken from different distances (and in this case different focal lengths) As you noticed, her face looks vastly different in the last (closest) picture compared to the first. With this in mind, make sure you keep a reasonable distance in your selfies so that people get an accurate idea of your face. Generally speaking with computer and cellphone cameras, most of the distortion happens when you get closer than 2 feet. And while we're at it, make sure you have adequate lighting, because all too often I see pictures here that look like they were taken underwater with your mom's 2001 webcam.

Well, in my last thread a few people asked that I give another update in the future.  The future is now!  As of today I have lost 83lbs from my heaviest weight of 306lbs.  Obviously I still have a long way to go, but I continue to lose weight every day.  

I gave up my gym membership for the summer because it's nice outside and that shit's hella expensive!  I'll be taking it up again once the weather turns, which sadly shouldn't be too far in the future.  

Today I decided to play with some heavy makeup and practice my ""out on the town in the evening"" look.  Once I did that, of course, my PJs really didn't look quite right so I threw on a nicer shirt.  
   [Tell me what you think?](http://i.imgur.com/uDkdg.png) **Warning: webcam pic**  

Do I look like a doofus?  Should I just stick to light makeup all the time, even when I'm going out?  Or should I use heavy makeup more often?  I think I look worse than in the picture from 6 months ago.  I think I look larger now, even though I'm about 40lbs lighter.  Uncool, man.

I have been told I look like a light skinned Jay Z. As you can imagine, being told you look like ""The Camel"" doesn't do much for a then teenage girl's self-esteem. It really hit home, as I'd been wanting a nosejob for years prior. It just confirmed my insecurities, that everyone else noticed my snozz too.

I cut off my relaxed hair about a year and a half ago because I figured I was ugly whether I had straight or natural hair. Had my cousin mock me for looking like a guy back when it was still short.

I feel my features are too large for my face. My nose is big and my lips are big and it just makes me look ridiculously disproportionate. I'm incredibly jealous of white and black girls who look gorgeous, rather than I, who looks like an ugly mix of both.

It doesn't help that the other times I've posted my face, people have literally laughed at how ugly I was (some kid just pasted a picture of a pretty blonde white girl over a my face and told me that was the only way I'd be close to attractive. Another said he was feeling generous and would give me a 6/10). I also had a woman think I was almost 30 when I was 19. I need to lose weight.

We saw a huge impact in visitors today after the two front-page posts over there.

[Graph Porn!](http://i.imgur.com/pjgkq.png) &lt;- Updated (8/28)

So welcome all of you to AIU. 

I just want to state a few things.

 * This subreddit was started so that people may ask others how they look, but we don't question their motives, and why should we? We don't care if you're a pretty girl looking for an ego-boost or somebody who truly has low self-esteem.  
 * We want to foster a good atmosphere. It's unfortunate that the moderators do not have time to read every comment, and so we leave it to our readership to report inappropriate posts. We appreciate everybody who does this. (If you are a long-time redditor [and even better, long time AIU'er and want to mod, PM me])
 * That said, there are very few types of posts which are ""inappropriate."" The simple rule (see the right-bar) is ""Don't be a dick."" That doesn't mean ""don't be honest."" Are they ugly? Sure, let them know. But how can they improve their looks? I find myself approving more comments than removing them in the report queue because somebody was upset that somebody got called fat. Tough, sorry.
 * The only comments I remove without scrutiny are those that encourage suicide (a surprising number of people love to recommend this) and those that are purposefully hateful (whether it be on the basis of race, orientation, or anything else.)
 * The fastest way to have your submission removed is for it to be NSFW / obviously not you. Sure, people can submit pictures which aren't obviously not them, but I don't see that being a problem.  
 * Lastly, please, please, please read the guidelines above new post. It gives you pointers on how to take a photo that is going to be better for you in the long run. Posting dishonest angles (myspace angles) or otherwise obscuring something about yourself is simply doing yourself a disservice (if you want the truth, anyway.)

Seriously, just have a good time here. As I have said in the sidebar here  ""I just want everybody to have fun and indulge in feeling a little vain, too, if you wish. :)""

People *do* get feedback, improve their looks, change their fashion, get haircuts, adjust their attitude, and leave feeling more confident. 

If, after reading this, you think this subreddit is still a huge circlejerk and you're bitter and angry about it, head on over to [/r/circlejerk](/r/circlejerk) or [/r/spacedicks](/r/spacedicks) or [/r/cats](/r/cats) or [/r/aww](/r/aww) and get it out of your system. And after that, if you *still* think this subreddit is dumb, please unsubscribe and don't downvote just because you think someone should already know they're pretty.

It's unfortunately really easy to post photos of someone you're not, act like an ass in the comments, and get a hundred comments telling a girl how much of an ugly, stuck-up bitch she is (especially if someone links the thread in /r/bestof for being [oh so honest](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/1et5ih/a_post_to_ramiguly_where_a_redditor_actually/)). So we're going to make it harder.

It has always been our rule that the photos you are posting must be of you, but now it seems that the honor system is not enough. Here is our proposed new rule for submitters, that we have agreed is necessary: you must post a picture of you that has your username and a timestamp in it. If you don't do this, the post will be removed if reported. And if you commenters see anything that looks fishy, report it.

I would really rather not bend the subreddit over backwards in order to deal with a few who are abusing it, but in this case I'm not sure what else we can do. One of the fakeposts this week was part of a campaign involving harassment on Facebook, Instagram, and death threats. As much as we're unable to stop all of that, we'd like to prevent the part that happens here.

TL;DR: we're going to require proof that you're the person in the pictures, in the form of a photo with their username and a timestamp in it.

Please stop posting on AmIUgly! I leave the same comment every time, because it is true every time: No, you are not ugly. You have great X and Y, which look awkward now because *you are still a kid*. Please allow yourself some time to grow into your features and develop as a person.

The fact that you have not dated in X amount of time or haven't had a serious relationship is not indicative of any exterior ugliness, nor any interior ugliness. You are still a kid and so are the girls/boys your age! You are not out on your own, paying your own bills, making your own decisions and supporting yourself. This means that, while some lucky (or unlucky, as I prefer to look at it, since it never ends well) few will find some teenage romance, for the most part you are not ready for any form of serious relationship. If you seriously disagree with that point, please assume that most of the girls/boys your age might be dealing with such an issue.

Give yourself some time. Join clubs, spend time with friends, watch porn, do whatever you need to do, but do not fall victim to the ridiculous Twilight fantasy that you need to find the one you love before your senior year or your life sucks.

Also understand that finding a girlfriend/boyfriend will not actually make you happier. It's true! If you struggle with loneliness, believe it or not, studies (and common sense) have shown that a significant other will not make any improvement on this aspect of your life.

Learn to be in the company of friends and form fulfilling non-romantic relationships. That's what the teen years are for! (That and getting caught jerking it by your mom.)

My point is, teens, there is nothing wrong with you. You will survive high school, if by nothing else than your own brute will, and if you can learn to be a happy and healthy individual, there is no doubt that you will someday find another happy and healthy individual to share experiences with.

Until then, best of luck through the shitty years,

Love,

Since some of you are probably going to make weight comments trust me it's a work in progress, down 140lbs in 1yr and a half.

Being morbidly obese for most of my life I still have a lot of issues now with self image. I have guys who think I'm attractive but with them being friends or nerds I tend to think they're just saying that or how low standards. 

As to the title I hate how I look in photos if I don't take them. Photos taken by me are fine and when I look in the mirror I don't think I look bad. However most photos my friends take I look like a different hideous person. I'm wondering if I'm just not photogenic or maybe I'm really that ugly.

Being overweight and a tom boy my whole life means fashion and make up are not my forte. I think I'm starting to develop a sense of style but I feel uncomfortable in a lot of the popular current fashion trends which I don't think helps my confidence much. I also hold myself to way too high of a standard sometimes, it's hard not to get depressed the my bone structure isn't built like a models.

5'8 / 175lbs / US Clothing size 8/10 / 40-30-40 / 36D

Perceived flaws: Aysmetrical wide face, ugly nose, wider than acceptable shoulders and big rib cage, big calves, and waist isn't small enough to pull off the hour glass.

Also hair advice would be helpful I'm growing it out but not sure where to go from there. I'm very aware I need to get new glasses. Frame suggestions would be appreciated.

TL;DR Am I not photogenic or just ugly? Hair and glasses advice is good too. Also do I really look young? I get told I look anywhere from 16 to 19.

**Edit** Sorry for the bad formatting I follow the directions for lists on the help page but it never seems to work.

**Edit 2** Thanks for the comments so far everyone. I am reading them and will probably get the time to properly respond after work :)

**Edit 3** I knew the smile would come up... I don't know how to smile naturally. When I smile for pictures my face actually hurts and anything beiyond a neutral/slight smirk brings out horrible lines in my cheeks that just look bad. Got any smiling tips? 

Thanks for the glasses suggestions. I may consider contacts it's just I'm so used to wearing glasses I do not know if that would look good.

I'll do a follow up post next week with comparison pics of glasses smiling vs no glasses. I'd do it today but a very angry bee ran into my lip while biking yesterday. I look like a botched botox job right now.

**Edit 4**

Gonna save myself some time here I usually get my eyebrows done so trust me I know that one helps alot. I do appreciate the make up tips tho.

I'm obese, I'm aware of that, no question about it. This is not about how fat I am, it's about how ugly I am. For sure, there might be a link for some folks, but in my case, I don't feel as if the fact that I'm fat is what's making my face ugly. It might be part of the problem, but I'm probably both, independantly. 

I just need honesty. I'm sick and tired of people wanting me to ""feel better"", and thinking that sugarcoating/lying will make me feel better. I don't need to feel better. I also know that people can become very different in one's mind when they know them. And I'm a somewhat decent person, so I might not be able to trust the folks around me on this. 

I do not have a self-esteem issue, so no worries there... I'd rather know my strengths and my weaknesses. For real. And looks can be a weakness. 

Feel free to rate me, insult me, whatever. I just need to figure that one out. 

EDIT: I'm married. It's not about getting men. It's about acceptance of myself, as I am. I want to get passed this for it to stop being relevant to me. 
Also, it can't be just about the fat... I wasn't always like this, in terms of body type, but I've always had this awkward, ugly face... 

EDIT 2: Wow, I don't know what to say... I was ready to be completely destroyed on teh Interwebs and yet, most feedback has been very kind, or at least, not even close to how I think I look.  The weight thing will work itself out (no pun intended), I've been working at it with my doctors/meds/diet/exercize. But in terms of my face, I'm truly puzzled.

1. Anything overtly sexual, positive or negative. 
1. Anything written which is considered overtly harsh on the OP. This does not mean we handle submissions with cotton gloves, but we commenters should be aware that there are people behind these submissions.
1. Anything accusing the submitters as ""attention whores""; although you may feel personally that the OP is confident and assured in his/her good looks, it is not for either the mods or the commenters to decide this. We work on the basis that everyone here is sincere in asking for advice from r/amiugly. 
4. Anything threatening, sexist or racist to the OP

Here is a small list of the comments we've recently banned to give you an example of what NOT to write:

""no, you just fail at argueing. you say she carries her weight well which is exactly what every obese dipshit tells other chubbies to make himself feel better.""

""what is this? a frog crossed with justin bieber?""

""shut up bitch I'm trying to watch.""

""Shut up faggot.""

""You're soul must be gay as shit.""

""Yes, you ugly faggot.""

Although the majority of comments on this subreddit provide great content and feedback for our submitters, there's a loud minority who feel like causing trouble with their immature, badly-written comments. So if you see anything that fits the criteria and examples above, please report it.

Thanks for reading,

/r/amiugly has a problem: On the front page right now, we have 20/F with 59 comments, 20/F with 77 comments, 19/F with 69 comments…and an older 23/M post has 10 comments. Hot girls get a lot of comments, and most guys get few. We welcome *anyone* of *any* level of attractiveness here, but it's a waste to have the most attractive people get the most comments, when they don't need the help. 

In fact, after about 30 comments at the most, they tend to get real repetitive and not add much in the way of new ideas.

For this reason, the mod team of /r/amiugly is proposing to create a comment limit, tentatively proposed at 30, at which point the entire post would be automatically deleted and visible only to the poster and people who kept the link. (20 was originally proposed, but we feel 30 gives a bit more wiggle room.)

Take a moment, look at some posts that would be culled under this policy, see what our front page looks like now, and decide what you think. We'd like to hear community feedback before we move ahead with a policy change of this nature so…speak to us! Thanks!

**EDIT** – FAQs

*Why not just lock the post at 30 comments but leave it up?*  
This is not an option Reddit offers. Deleting the post allows the OP to still see it, but it won't be listed in /r/amiugly any more…not that different from a lock, really.

*Why does it matter if a few popular posts are at the top? There's lots of unpopular ones just a little further down.*  
Because most of /r/amiugly's 30K subscribers only see the top 1 or 2 posts mixed in on their frontpage, rather than visiting /r/amiugly itself to see all of them. If the top post has 70 comments, that's all they see and click and comment on. Having the top post be one that doesn't need compliments damages odds of other people getting comments. 

*Won't people just game this system?*  
Well, maybe, but this policy will not be written anywhere, so the majority of users won't know about it. It'll also be silently enforced – people aren't notified when their post is deleted. We have several such ""silent policies"" already in place to avoid gaming systems. (No, they aren't exciting…it's stuff like auto-removing links to certain websites that we find often normally lead to bad things, etc.)",,False,self,t5_2rgjh,1368336591.0,,,True,t3_1e5x9v,http://www.reddit.com/r/amiugly/comments/1e5x9v/modpost_subscriber_feedback_wanted_for_possible/,moderator

I started dieting again in hopes of raising a lil self confidence. I'm down 45lbs and weigh as much as i did at like 14. I'm happier with who i see now but still the same person on the inside. I don't feel like any girl (that i am remotely attracted to) would even consider me. I was always friend-zoned by the girls i liked.

However I feel as though I am being lied to. Or I am lying to myself. Sometimes I stare at myself in the mirror for very long periods of time, and each time I loathe my appearance a little more.

I have a weird sort of obsession with the male body and its strength and I would also like to be very strong but I always seem to be quite weak. I try to work out often but my arms do not morph into the shape I want them to and my legs remain curvy. At these times I truly do wish I were male and I feel very very ugly.

I have very low self esteem because of these conflicting messages I send to myself. I am always telling myself that I should remain feminine and flirty and that I should wear dresses and that I should open my eyes wide and be cute, and make men attracted to me. At the same time I am also telling myself not to be weak ever, that I shouldn't cry EVER, that I should be able to fight a man and win, that I should be able to run two miles and not get tired, that I should be able to feel only muscle on my body. So then when I see a mirror I see curves and feminine features and I feel softness around my thighs and stomach and I hate that. Then when I am telling myself to be feminine I see more tendons in my neck and muscles on my body than I would like and I hate that. This also translates to my face. I have a hard time recognizing my face, or, I mean.. I have a hard time seeing the same person twice, so that each time I look in the mirror I look like someone different, but each of those people are very ugly to me.

I don't know what to do. Do I look weak? Is my face very masculine (ugly for a female)? Is it very feminine (not ugly for a female)? What do I look like to you? 

1. This is when I was feeling feminine. http://i.imgur.com/6yzOvfX.jpg

2. This is when I was feeling masculine. http://i.imgur.com/OkmRTdO.jpg 

I think there is a large difference in the two. Does my nose not look more masculine in the second photo? 


3. Here is my arm. Is it weak (ugly) or strong (not ugly)? http://i.imgur.com/QtxD2Bw.jpg

4. This is my torso and most of my legs. http://i.imgur.com/DXZMbYk.jpg  I neither look feminine nor masculine in this photo and that bothers me.

I'm going to try and show my appreciation and share my story without this being way too long, I hope that's alright (edit - just finished writing this and yeah it's way too long. oops.).

I posted here several months ago, I was horribly insecure, knowing I was no model and knowing there was something ""off"" about my appearance. I hated my nose, forehead, skin tone, everything. I was doing everything I could to look my best, I wore makeup, was trying out new hairstyles, and smiled with my mouth closed as I hated my teeth and the way I looked when I smiled. I am 19, live in a small town, and had never received any (non-intoxicated) male attention, people seemed rather put off by me in fact. Not just boys but girls my age and older people just seemed to dismiss me right away. I was never involved in any group events and had (well I still do have, but that's changing) few friends.

So I took a few pictures in my bathroom and posted them on here. I got mostly nice responses, at least if I got any rude ones I don't remember. I remember several people posting, and upvoting the post that said my closed-mouth smile made them uncomfortable, that they thought it looked ""judgmental"", ""cold"", and ""off-putting"". Out of all the criticisms I was expecting to get that one just really threw me offguard. But I trusted the community and started practicing my ""terrible"" open mouthed smile I hadn't used since before puberty. It felt really awkward at first but after tons of persistence and awkward moments in front of the mirror it started feeling more natural. All of a sudden I learned what my best smile looked like (and I also learned how I should absolutely not smile). I posted on here again with my open mouthed smile, not having tried it out in public, and got drastically different responses.

That's when I started being a lot less self-conscious about who I was and what I looked like. I don't think it was JUST my smile, just these tiny little social cues that I had repressed to seem more ""proper"". Anyway, about two weeks after I posted I was at a party and my friends had just gone off for a little bit when a guy saw I was alone and started talking to me. He was much more drunk than I was (and a little bit obnoxious) but I just talked to him and laughed with him, not expecting anything from him though he kept saying he was going to take me out on a date the following day. I just thought it was the alcohol, that he'd be telling his friends about the ugly chick he'd been with the night before. So imagine my surprise when he actually did message me the next day asking if I wanted to go to the movies with him. Well, I was even more shocked when he turned out to be the absolute sweetest (and hottest) guy ever and how well we got along.

What drew him to me in the first place? My smile, apparently. He says he fell in love with my smile the first time he saw me, that it was the reason he felt compelled to sit with me when we first met. Now I already know that I am by no means a Megan Fox type girl or Sofia Vergara or well any supermodel, actress or singer. But he makes me feel beautiful and I can honestly say that if I had not posted on here that I would not be in the position I am in now. It wasn't just about the smile, it was about the confidence that comes with it and I think it just gave me a little bit of a confidence boost to put myself out there. At work I've been smiling with my new smile and my coworkers have started accepting me more, they actually chat with me now, and my classmates have started greeting me in the halls. Customers are also much nicer. I didn't realize my smile was scaring people off and no one but the people on here were even willing to tell me that. And for that, people of amiugly, I will be forever thankful. :]

I know some people may be rolling their eyes at this post, thinking it's horribly vain, but as many of the posters here have realized, appearance does matter. Presentation does matter. And a lot of the time people are too nice to say anything. Just being able to connect with somebody and not feeling like you're scum, actually feeling beautiful for the first time in your post-adolescent life, it's empowering. I can't even describe it. This is getting to be way too long but thank you, thank you, thank you again amiugly. This community may have its flaws but you guys really are making a difference.

I was overweight for most of my life, and last November I decided to do something about it. I lost 50 lbs by June. I was pretty proud of myself. I'm not super confident in my body, but meh. It's a lot better now than it was. I just am always super self conscious about my face, and it's actually gotten worse since I've lost weight. 

I really would like some tips on hair that would be flattering, or how I should do my makeup or whatever. I just want to look better, ok?

(I removed the links. Thanks for being so kind, everyone) the first three photos are just of me derping around (so you know what I look like when I'm not all... posed and stuff), and the black and white one is from around april, when I was still a little heavier than I am now (and my hair was shorter and darker). The last is from like 15 minutes ago (my hair is super long and in my face now so I wear it up like 24/7).

edit number 2: wow guys, when I went to bed there were close to 20 comments, and I wake up to this! A lot of people were saying that my septum ring was unattractive, and they might be pleased to know that I removed it a few months ago (it became painful to keep it in, not sure why). You guys have all been incredibly nice to me. I still would feel totally weird saying ""I think I'm attractive/pretty/etc"", but posting here has helped me feel a little less hideous.

Even right now, I want to just close the tab and not put myself out here.

Since I was ~13, I've always been scared of what others think of me, personality wise and by my looks. I had a huge gap in my teeth (two of my teeth never formed, so my other teeth had all this space to just free roam), which started my fear of what people think. In the past year, I've finally gained to confidence to actually smile and show all my teeth, and not think it's absolutely ugly. I'm probably going to always have an issue with my teeth though, until I get a permanent solution for the fake canine teeth. (I wear a partial.)

I just want to know the honest truth about how I look. I'm trying to go on dates and actually try and date (never really dated before, aha), but it seems like no guy is interested, no matter how hard (or little) I try.  So...help?

I've been on r/amiugly for a while now, commenting on various people, and I gotta say most of you look great. The problem, here, is that we can't always tell if you people look good or bad. So here's a few tricks you can base yourself on to get a maximum of feedback.

**Have a full body picture**

I know some of you like taking headshot photos, but let's be honest here, there isn't much for us to hint if we only see your face. The easiest way with this is a bathroom mirror shot. Simple as that.

**Wear your everyday clothes**

Yes, that suit/dress looks fabulous on you, but that cutie sitting next to you in the bus might think otherwise when you wear your favourite hoodie. I know there are other subreddits such as [r/fashion](http://www.reddit.com/r/fashion/) and [r/malefashionadvice](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/) for this, but it doesn't hurt to try here also.

**Point out what part of you you want feedback**

This usually makes it easier to judge upon since people are often obsessed over this one part of their body. Do take notice that this **does not** imply that you should go for plastic surgery, but then again, it's your life. So you do what you want with it.

**Use an Imgur album instead of multiple links**

I may just be difficult on this, but too often am I seeing things like http://imgur.com/3IKPrhttp://imgur.com/l0wuhhttp://i.imgur.com/RGsf9.jpghttp://img.fae.ro/528d52.jpeg and this is just silly. Try using an album on Imgur, or at least just press the spacebar once in a while.

[19F],stupidestthrowaway,83,25,90,http://www.reddit.com/r/amiugly/comments/lz3q9/am_i_truly_ugly_19f/,"Aight, so basically I've been on and off depressed because of stupid things like my big jaws, narrow temples, a big nose and small eyes. It used not to bother me but suddenly it has had a great impact on my life, complete with a suicide attempt because I thought I was disgusting. Now, being a hairless ape, I'm quite concerned about my looks. I have a vain, sadly hilarious need to be as pretty as the girls around me, which is, I find, very hard. I'm not overweight, I don't have any medical disfigurement, I just think I'm plain outright ugly. I've started inspecting and measuring my face, my jaws are too big compared to my temples and my eyes are  freaking tiny compared to my nose. Suddenly all of those things matter a tremendous lot and I've started thinking some really dumb things, crying and feeling like a disgusting lump of crap. I realize this can't be normal, I've never really seen anyone that's actually this ugly other than me. I'm afraid this is something in my head, some kind of a medical condition that makes me think I'm the ugliest duckling around. And it also makes me think it actually matters a lot.

So I humbly ask you, Reddit, am I truly ugly? What can I do, other than plastic surgery, to stop it and feel better about myself?

It's just hard to believe I am attractive ALL of the time, or even sometimes. I am trying hard to be more confident though!

Besides weight, my biggest worries are that I feel like I can look masculine in the face sometimes, and that my lips are too small, and my nose is slightly crooked, my chin a little too big for my lips, and my hips are huge. This all exaggerates as I gain weight.

But I keep wanting to give you all the same tips, so here are my big ones for everyone posting here.",Purple_Antwerp,60,4,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/amiugly/comments/fjauw/i_love_you_guys_but_i_keep_wanting_to_give_you/,"Hey all, **none** of you are fucking ugly.  I love you all regardless, though.

I look at some of the guys here and I'm fucking jealous of how you look, and I certainly do alright with ladies.  I look at the women here, and I would totally chat you all up at parties.  And I don't mean creepily - like, the good kind of chatting up. Er, usually.

However, I think that a lot of you are making some elementary mistakes posting here.  Regardless of your looks or confidence level or bizarre third arms growing out of your lower back, here's some tips to getting more out of this Subreddit and to help yourself in general for your quest for hotness:

**SMILE!**
You all look like someone just insulted your puppy.  The majority of looking good is confidence - give us a smile like you just fucked the hottest person in the word, were just offered a seven figure salary, and recently inherited a small tropical island - and also like you don't want to show off too much.

This goes the same for real life.  People want to fuck people that are smiling - if you are smiling, something must be going well for you.  If something is going well for you, well then, I want to know what it is and probably will sleep with you/date you/be your friend/whatever to find out.  Because chances are, that person you think is too hot to talk to is NOT smiling.  Make them happy.  You want to make them happy, right?  Yes, yes you do.


**GIVE US BETTER PICTURES.**

* Lighting is vital.  Don't. Put. Dark. Pictures. Here.  You'll look awful!
* No cell phone pictures - EVERYONE looks ugly in cell phone pictures!
* Get a good bit away from the camera.  Surely you're not ugly enough you can't figure out how to set the delay on your phone, or have someone else take it.  If your face is really close to the camera, it distorts how you actually look.  5' is good!
* A couple of face shots are great, if that's all you are concerned about.  But if you want body advice, let us see you from the front and side and *please don't do it holding the camera in front of a mirror.*

**HAIRCUT!**
This mainly goes for the guys here.  Try and give us a picture that doesn't make it look like a weed-whacker just tried to make love to your 'do - unless that is a good ""look"" on you.  And it likely isn't.  You will look better with a decent haircut.

**CONFIDENCE!**
Okay, this is actually the big one.  This subreddit should really be called: ""immiddlin'togreatlookin',butmistakelackofconfidenceforphyiscalunattractiveness.""  Of course, that's too long.  But you get my point - virtually everyone here is good enough looking to not be ""forever alone,"" or fuck, even ""alone through the end of the week.""  

Y'all can head to [/r/fitness](www.reddit.com/r/fitness) or [/r/loseit](www.reddit.com/r/loseit) if you think you need more muscle/less fat.  Those two subreddits really shaped my butt up (both my real but, and in terms of my confidence).

But seriously - put on some awesome, well-fitted clothing, get a haircut, do your makeup (if that's your thing), listen to your favorite ""get amped"" song and go to the nearest bar with people your age.  Smile.  Make eye contact.  Talk to attractive people at the bar.  If it doesn't make you feel better after trying to talk to 5 people in a night, come back here and I'll personally give you a goddamned makeover, fitness program, and whatever else it takes to get that strategy to work for you.

You're all beautiful.

we debated whether young people should be allowed to post here. Most people understood that any strict rules would be counter-productive and difficult to enforce, but also felt it was important that we not harm kids by exposing them to harsh criticism before it's even useful, playing into their insecurity, and providing an audience for pedophiles.

You have spoken, and the mods have listened. **Threads by users under the age of 16 are now disallowed, and will be removed by mods when we see them.** You can help bring them to our attention by reporting them. And you can also help, as you did before, by telling the submitter why they shouldn't be worried about such things.

------------------------------

###Today's Topic:

There isn't one. It's exam crunch time for me and a couple of the other mods, so we don't have a topic made up to introduce for this thread. That's also why this thread is late. If anyone has something they think is worth discussing, bring it up here and we'll go at it, maybe making it the topic of the next megathread.

-------------------------

###Other news:

**Automoderator** has been added as a mod to this subreddit. He is a bot, and will automatically remove threads that link to Facebook-hosted images (which can be used stalk you), remove meta threads (because there's a place for that commentary, modmail or here in the megathread), and approve threads by folks with a lot of karma. Don't worry, if your thread gets removed he'll tell you why, and you can always message us mods if you think it's undeserved. That means hopefully no more getting stuck in the spam queue!

But it also means your **reports** are even more important. If you see a thread or comment that breaks the rules of the subreddit or is trollish, press the report button under it, and we'll take a look at it.

The **CSS** has been changed as described in the last thread, and we're looking for feedback on the changes. I've added an announcement to the top that links to this thread, that's a no-brainer I think. 

I've added in blackstar9000's vote faders, but I think the text in them is rather weak and unclear, so any suggestions for voting guidelines that are short enough to fit in it would be great. 

I've also put the rules in their own thread and linked to it in an image in the sidebar, this is probably the most experimental change. I did this because they're so damn long and you don't really need to see them if you know them already, and also to get more people who haven't read them to give it a go. Nobody reads big walls of text anyway, they're more likely to click on pictures, I think. The image itself was made by me in paint.net in 20 seconds. It's temporary, so make a better one and we'll add it in! Otherwise, I'll go poking around and see what I can drum up. Anyway, if you and/or my fellow mods think that was a bad move, just say so and I'll revert it. 

Oh, and finally, I made the text box real big, in the hopes that this will make people more likely to leave longer comments. Worth a try.

The css code was stolen variously from /u/SQLwitch, /u/raerth, and /u/blackstar9000, so many thanks to them. ",,False,self,t5_2rgjh,True,,,True,t3_sfphv,http://www.reddit.com/r/amiugly/comments/sfphv/meta_megathread_3_childhoods_end_submissions_from/,

I've had severe acne since I was 13 and at 23 it shows no signs of going away competely, although I'm dealing with this, the effect(s) it's had on my skin over the years is unlikely to go away.
The second of two major factors to my looks is the non-symmetry of my face, caused by the cleft palette I had when I was born- the dealing of which has left me with a scarred lip, wonky nose and a false front tooth.

Recently I've seen some pretty damn ugly people posting on here and no offence to them and especially not excluding myself from that category, but the replies to a lot of these posts are not ugly maybe average+, when clearly they are below average.

All I can see coming from this is that people will develop a false image of themselves, thinking they are actually better looking than they are. Unfortunately while this will overcome their self image problems, if the individual still has no luck with the dating department then as they now feel good about their looks they could very easily start to put the blame on their personality or other aspects of themselves which may not be at fault. So really by not giving people the truth and telling them truthfully that yes they are ugly but heres what you can do about it, you may be leading them on a path to overcoming self image problems but lead them on to hating themselves as a person rather than just their looks, which to me is much worse.

To make a long story a little less long, I was bullied pretty badly from age 11 to 13 and most of the taunts were centered on my appearance. I switched ~~schools~~ countries when I completed the 7th grade, and had a much better school experience after that. The bullying must have left some significant remnants though (along with internalised crap about how only boys had insulted me), because I cut my hair really short and only wore baggy, boyish clothes until I graduated high school. I was mistaken for a boy on an almost daily basis, but I found a weird kind of solace in it, almost as though it made me exempt from ridicule if I didn't try. 
[(me in high school)](http://i.imgur.com/GLXPgSP.png?1?9048)

Fast forward to college: I started growing my hair out and dressing nicer. I get a little bit of male attention now, but I feel like any guy who compliments me either has very low expectations or is outright fucking with me. I have a wonderful boyfriend now who insists I look fine, but I still resort to ""comfort"" tactics like 24/7 make-up and a fringe that covers my forehead. Lately he's been telling me he wants me to grow out the fringe, but the thought is terrifying (I have a giant forehead, my eyebrows are uneven, and my nose is big/hooked). I'm genuinely concerned, so throw politeness out the window and let me have it.

I got my monroe pierced when I was 15, and I still love it, although, I think it makes my smile weird. It's a love/hate relationship.

I got my septum pierced, and sometimes I regret it just because it's odd. But at the same time I love the fact that it distracts people from noticing that my nose is crooked. 

I sometimes regret cutting my hair as short as it is, but I wanted to be different. Sometimes I can hear people in the hallways of my high school making fun of me, or calling me a dyke (I'm perfectly straight), and it's very hurtful. I like my short hair on the other hand, because it's easy to manage and I can still style it different ways.

I just guess I want some reassurance. Am I ugly?

I'm not comfortable with my looks, my body in particular. I'm ~5'10/5'11, and distinctly apple shaped. That is, normally proportioned limbs, with a large torso. My waistline is mercurial, depending on the time of the month/diet/clothing it can be either extremely defined, or extremely brick like (which is the case today, in the photos.) I've started dieting and exercising, since it helps diminish the boobs &amp; belly, and remedy my disturbing lack of ass.

Anyway, all those body issues are interfering with my personal life. The guy I like is a little bit smaller than me. He's smart, sweet, we get along great, but I doubt he could find me physically attractive. It's not so much an issue of him being too short; I don't mind, it's only an inch or so. I'm just worried that I seem like a fat Amazon to him. 

I included a bunch of pictures. The first 3 are halfway flattering. The next 4 I just took just now (read: barefaced, bloated, on the rag.) The last one is me with flat ironed hair and too much eye makeup.

Anyway, here are my questions! 

1. Would you be disgusted/scared/uncomfortable if I asked you out? Is it weird for a girl to be slightly larger than her boyfriend?

2. How do I look, in general? Any input on what to wear, how to groom myself better, etc.? I would love your advice!",,False,self,t5_2rgjh,False,,,True,t3_162hqf,http://www.reddit.com/r/amiugly/comments/162hqf/f16_help_me_reddit/,

These include: Having mothers/sisters approach you and ask if you're single because their son/brother is interested, getting marriage proposals, getting engaged, having a bf/gf that you do not necessarily go out with but instead just see on campus, and of course there are people who date. A good bunch of the girls in my class are already engaged, and I'd say that *at least* 50% of the rest have a thing going on with someone. 

As for me: I went to the library with a guy that I really liked once, and I'm still not sure if that was a date! I also used to get 'cat calls' much more frequently when I was younger - but somehow those have disappeared completely when I started going to university! Perhaps I look more 'mature' or stressed out now? 


A lot of girls think I'm too thin to be seen as sexy, and a lot of guys suggest that I change my hairstyle (and by ""hairstyle"" they're more often than not referring to my hair*type*, which is curly and frizzy). One guy and a couple of girls also said that my nose is too big (I agree).

Anyway, I plan on moving to a less conservative country very soon (in less than two weeks, actually) and I have no idea what to expect! Will guys ask me out?!

I've been lurking here for a while and I've finally bit the bullet. I know I'm not that bad looking and I understand that any flaws I have with getting dates is based in periodic lapses of confidence. (If I'm myself around the ladies, I'll do just fine.) However, I was unlucky enough to be born with a double cleft lip and palet. So you can imagine how that would effect ones confidence levels about their appearance. I grew up with people staring at me, bullying all that jazz. I've grown past all that stuff and I'm pretty happy these days! Except I've never felt like I've been in the relm of being physically attractive. So i'm curious what your first impression is.

So if you have compliments, criticisms or judgements,  I'd love to hear them! I wish I had pictures of myself dressing as well as I can (malefashionadvice ftw), or showing how fit I am under the t-shirt (swimming everyday + abs workouts ;), but I tend to be the guy taking pictures instead of being in them :P. 

Thanks for your time!

Edit: **WOW** Reddit! You folks are wonderful. I'll be looking like [this](http://ragefac.es/315) for the rest of the year, lol. I'll try my best getting the muscle back on. I used to lift weights (was 185lb) but joint problems forced me to stop, so I swim like a fish these days to keep as fit as I can (165lb). It's really nice to know theres folks out there who find me cute and interesting looking. Thats all I ever hoped for, and it's all I need hahaha.

Thank you and upvotes for all! :)

What sort of clothes do you think would look good on me?

**EDIT** Okay so I've read every single comment and I thought I'd address the most common one. The one about my thinking I'm ""fat"".  I live in a decently higher class society and I'm very privileged, as are other kids my age around here. That being said, there are not a lot of heavy-set teens around here. There just aren't. In addition to being larger than the girls in my community, my own sister is a size double zero (approx. 105 lbs?) and is also 5'5, so that definitely doesn't make me feel better when I come home after looking at other smaller girls all day.

I've been really self-conscious for a long time, but I've grown a bit more confident in the last two years. Even then, I've noticed absolutely no change in any interest towards me. My attitude is right, I'm friendly, but I get zero interest from guys.

Am I ugly? Is there any improvements I can make? I'm working on my weight right now, I only have about 20lbs to go until I reach my goal weight, so that's being done with, but is there anything else I really have to fix? I really do want to improve myself, so I would really appreciate straightforward honesty. Thanks.

-Edit to add a picture that shows the shape of my eyebrows. Its the only one I have at the moment. This is an old picture, please keep in mind.

Cokefizz said to fix them and I realized you can get a good idea of what they look like in full.  So, if anyone has tips on what to do with them, I am very open. The fronts have a mind of their own.

Edit 2!
I wanted to add some photos that show my eyebrows a little better, since they have gotten a little bit of attention.
Also, two that show some makeup. Its hard to see, and they are a bit old so I've gotten better at doing make up.

Eyebrows:

Here you can see the crazyness that is my eyebrows. The fronts just stand. I cant pencil them in, because its too obvious too suddenly. I've heard of some sort of.. eyebrow gel type things.. which I might try. but I fear that with the way they grow it will still look odd and unnatural. 

And lastly, Smile photos.

Most of the guys I see tend to go for girls that look a lot different than me which makes me lack confidence. 


 I have really bad skin as well but it's not that noticeable in these pictures because they aren't of great quality. I want to know if there is anything I can do to improve my appearance. I look like a doof in the head on shot so sorry about that.

1334733508.0,47,self.amiugly,sfosa,Da Rules (updated),joke-away,55,8,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/amiugly/comments/sfosa/da_rules_updated/,"###Read These Rules You Gits

---------

###Commenting:

1. **Don't post ""3/10"" or ""would fuck"".** This isn't a rateme sub. That would be /r/rateme. Here it's encouraged to give advice and details along with your opinions, and single numbers like ""3/10"" will be removed, as will ""would hit it"", and ""yes, ugly"". You gotta write something.

2. **Don't question motives** here as long as they're not posting excessively (more than once a month without any major changes). Please don't accuse people of using the sub as a hugbox just because they're attractive.

3. **Don't dig up personal info.** Anything that looks like personal information digging gets you a ban and reported to the admins. Don't do it. Ever.

4. Be honest but **have some tact.** Don't be a dick. Stay classy. (Telling people about how you're touching yourself isn't classy.)

5. Try to comment on people of your own sex once in a while. Don't worry, you can't catch gay over the internet. In general, guys get way fewer comments than gals, so try to share the love.

6. **Don't send creepy private messages** to submitters. What's creepy? Professing your undying love, bad poetry, pictures of your junk, and invitations to be strokin'.

###Submitting:

1. **If you're under 16, don't submit.** You're too young for anything that could be said here to affect you positively. You're going to grow up, your looks are going to change, it's no big deal. Go outside and have fun!

7. **Better photos get better feedback.** Try to take them at arms' length away, not in a mirror, and not with your face obscured by an object or stupid grimace.

6. **Don't use Facebook or photobucket** as a photo host. They're insecure and can be used to stalk you. Posts using them get removed for your safety. Threads that do this get autoremoved by AutoModerator.

1. **No nudes.** Keep it SFW.

2. **Don't post pictures that aren't of you.** That means none of your friend or significant other, because protecting folks' privacy is important. They need to post their own pictures. And try to even keep other people out of pictures of you, again because of privacy but also because it can get confusing for commenters.  **Include proof** that you, the person posting the photos, are also the person in the photos. The easiest form of proof is a [picture of you including the day's date.](http://i.imgur.com/IFG1FgC.png) This is to prevent abusive posting of others' photos as a form of harassment. If you don't include proof your post will be removed if reported.

4. **Don't use this place as a hugbox.** There's no way for us to tell, so, if you're gonna you're gonna, but please, if you just want someone to make you feel better, try [/r/mmfb](/r/mmfb) which is designed for exactly that purpose (and would love to have you)!

8. **[Edit your thread to remove the photos afterwards.](http://www.reddit.com/r/amiugly/comments/ptvuc/how_to_delete_your_postphotos_from_ramiugly/)** Don't just delete the post, because that will leave the photos up. Delete the post after you have removed the photos. Keep in mind that even this doesn't mean your photos are still somewhere on the internet, or on someone else's computer now.

3. **Don't post more than once a month,** unless you've seriously done something different. Don't repost at all unless you've changed or got very little feedback the first time.

5. **If you want to talk about the subreddit, message the mods,** because odds are everyone's heard it before, and we're the only ones who are going to change anything anyway. **OR** post it in one of the **new** weekly meta megathreads! Unconstructive meta-posts like ""everyone here is pretty what the fuck"" and ""you're all attention whores"" just get removed anyway.

9. **No joke threads.** There's too many possible jokes, if we allowed them we'd be flooded with them. M16, M5, M1, F-16, F-18, F-20, F-22, F-35, have all already been made. If you think of one, pat yourself on the back for being clever, but don't post it.

###Voting:

* **Don't upvote/downvote based on appearance.** Upvote/downvote based on whether the person needs more responses. If the person has few responses, or you just think they need more than they have, upvote.

###Auxiliary subreddits :

* Check out /r/bodyacceptance for discussion about lookism and how a person's value depends on more than their appearance. Also if you're having trouble dealing with how you look.

* If you don't feel you're ugly try [r/AmISexy](http://reddit.com/r/AmISexy).

I'm 5'11) and it has left me feeling SUPER unattractive and unable to snap myself out of the cyclical routine of emotional eating and inactivity which make me feel awful about myself and only lead to a perpetuation of the bad habits for comfort.

These are some of the only decent ones.  How can I improve?  I'm pretty shy and have really bad social anxiety, making it hard to make friends and even harder to attract the opposite sex.

**What I'm working on**
*Used to be a endurance runner so I got stuck at 5'8 about 130 pounds.  I'm working on eating more and lifting to get bigger.

*I'd like to get my teeth whitened.  I drink a lot of soda and coffee and it has done a lot on my teeth.  I don't like to smile.

*Taking yoga class.  I like the strength/flexibility and it doesn't hurt that the class is full of women.  Makes me feel good/gets me out of the house, but no luck there.

*I constantly struggle with acne, it's constant maintenance to get it under control.  It makes me feel like shit when my skin isn't nice. (looks clear here)

I'm a 21-year-old Asian woman who has *never* been hit on or asked out, except by 50-yo+ white men with massive Asian fetishes. Because I'm short (5'), flatchested (B), and chubby (110-20 lb), with a Jackie Chan nose and tiny eyes and a wide face run over multiple times by the acne truck, I've always assumed it was my looks. Even my parents make fun of how ugly I am (as I look NOTHING like my pale model-esque mother), and men constantly ignore me in conversations when my prettier friends are there. 

My self-esteem's taken a pretty big hit over the years as every Y-chromosome-possessor my age has either friendzoned or avoided me. I try not to let it get to me, I try to stay friendly and positive despite a natural introversion, but I'm beginning to suspect I'll have to seize the initiative if I ever want to have a relationship. What I worry about is whether I'll offend a guy if I hit on him - ie will he instinctively flinch thinking, 'EW NO THIS FUGLY IS HITTING ON ME!' since I see this all the time (including on Reddit) when guys mention fat or ugly girls. 

I asked my closest friend and she told me I should only approach as a desperate last resort - if the guy were even slightly interested, he'd show some interest first. Male redditors, is this true?? :/

I just don't know what to do. I can't afford a boob job or surgery for my acne scars, I have PCOS and I already eat/exercise well so I doubt I can lose more weight, and I can hardly grow taller without cyborging myself. I wish I didn't care so much about my appearance since I know there are LOTS of other things I should be working on that are far more important in life, it just hurts when you're nearly 22 and *STILL* haven't gotten to second base, much less lost your virginity. :(

I bought a trimmer and took off the stache and cleaned off my beard and got a new hair cut. I also started lifting weights, cycling, and even met a girl recently.

Sorry for the poor quality on some of those. 

I usually describe myself as ""passably cute"", meaning I won't make someone run away screaming, but I'm not pretty or beautiful or anyone that someone would actually pursue. I get ""adorable"" sometimes, or compliments on just my eyes, but never hot or sexy. 

I think my biggest problem lies in my bulbous, weird shaped nose, and horribly huge front teeth. I had braces to fix my crooked teeth when I was a teenager, but there was nothing they could do about the size of my front teeth. I've been giving thoughts to a nose job to fix the shape of my nose and for my teeth either veneers to make them all proportional at least, or even something drastic like  tooth shaving and reshaping. Think I should go for it?

I'm constantly reading about how comments have been removed for being ""too honest"" and that we mods are far too sensitive to what we perceive as inappropriate feedback and deleting comments unjustly.

Although I'm really only speaking for myself here (although I'm sure the other mods will agree with the general tone of my argument), I don't think this is the case. In fact, having been a mod on this subreddit for some time now I think criticism is becoming more shaped and accessible for submitters. Although I have at times agreed with what I've seen as fairly innocuous advice given on submissions (mostly on male submissions), in recent months I've seen more and more examples of people leaving with general tips on how to improve themselves. I've noticed more and more submissions doing comeback submissions a few months later after using the advice they were given, and these sort of submissions that show a real positive, tangible effect on people's lives are particularly heartening.

However, with this arguable increase in practical advice on [/r/amiugly](/r/amiugly) there have been more and more comments I personally regard as vicious. And to this is I just want to remind anyone out there who thinks we're being unfair that behind these submissions are real people. People regardless of whether you believe they have genuine doubts about their appearances, are asking for advice and letting themselves be vulnerable to a whole community of commenters.

Bear that in mind next time you want to call someone ""an ugly bitch/slut"", or make a ruthless remark about somebody's appearance, and question whether the reason we removed your comment is because you're ""too honest"" for [/r/amiugly](/r/amiugly).

Sincerely, 

Scrumpy.

I used to weigh [290 pounds] (http://i.imgur.com/uep6RjN.jpg) and be sickly and be horribly out of shape. I wore a size 48 pants, 3 XL shirts, and ate terribly. I was a candy and pizza kind of guy. I loved pizza (Im Italian) and I loved candy (Three Musketeers, Kit Kats, Skittles). My diet consisted of massive amounts of so much unhealthy. 

Around August of last year, I posted here on a different account, which I deleted and lost the post, pics, and all that so sorry. But I was told, bluntly, I was ugly. Yes, at first it hurt like a bitch. It did. I got mad. I got defensive. And overall it just sucked. The next day though I woke and felt like I was ready to make a change. So I did. I cut my hair, shaved my terrible beard, and began a rigorous diet and workout plan. Now was it easy? Hell no. But looking back, I had to do it.

Today I am a different man. I am now 180 pounds, work out daily, walk miles a day, and eat better. All because of this subreddit. So now I am here to tell you, the person who is reading this sad and lonely, that it can be done. Just try. Keep trying. And everything will be alright.

Moral of the story. Change your life. You can do it. I still am dedicated to this. I never go a day saying, ""Meh I'll just stop this now"". Nope. I keep it up. Just get motivated. 

You're **all** handsome and beautiful in your own way. Just gotta find it.

2. This is me all dressed up for prom, I knew the picture was coming so I look a bit better than I normally might.
3. Another average picture, this one with the best friend I mentioned above. 
4. Me at school making a quirky face - I was dressed up as a cowgirl for a lacrosse pre-game thing.
5. A photo I took about 5 seconds ago on my computer.

I go through periods of being 'okay' but not happy with myself and my life to just plain hating myself and thinking of suicide. 

I've never dated, been in love or anything. I don't believe most guys find me 'attractive' or would like me if they 'really' got to know me anyway.

Eek, this is my first Reddit thread. I hope you're kind with me. Kinda nervous about posting but here goes...

Hi.

I used to be pretty big (196lbs at 5'5""!) and managed to lose 42lbs and become a size 10-12. I looked great, with only 14lbs to my goal weight. However, a multitude of factors led me to gain back around half the weight I lost and now I feel like crap :(

I'm also insecure about certain features, as most people are. I hate my nose, my lips, my feet, my hands, my skin discolouration on my face. I am pretty self critical in my head. But not alarmingly so, I don't think so. I also have depression, anxiety, was severely bullied for most of my childhood and have had a hard time growing up as a teenager, which factors in a lot.

So I guess I'm just looking for some opinions on my physical appearence right now. Here are some more shots, including body shots. I apologise for any 'mirror photos', it's just easier to take a full length in a mirror.

Not sure if you guys remember me but around 6 months ago I posted and asked if I was still ugly. I had recently lost 27lbs and was feeling kinda down about my looks. I was 18 (well I'm still 18) and I had a self-esteem problem. I was constantly compared to my gorgeous older sister, and I based my self-worth on my looks alone. I promised to post when I lost the remaining 40 lbs and I've done just that so here I am! :D Since losing weight I am so much more confident and just all around happier with myself. I also am no longer obsessed with my looks, but more about my health.

Just this year alone, I've gone from 115lbs to 140lbs, and now I'm back to 128lbs at 5 ft 2. I'm Asian and I live in an Asian country, where girls my height are typically ~100lbs. (Not South Korea, by the way. A few pictures were taken there but I'm not South Korean.)

I'm working hard on keeping my weight down, but sometimes I think that there's no point because I'm not at an unhealthy weight, and no matter how much weight I lose, I'm always going to be unattractive. So what's the point, right? (Yeap, self-esteem issues.) 

There are so many flaws on my face that I don't really know where to start. I had a fall when I was younger from a rollerblading incident and I ended up with a small scar on my chin. You can see a small bump in the second picture. Also, my eyes are obviously mismatched, and almost completely disappear when I smile wide. (And this really throws me off because I am easily amused = I smile and laugh a lot.) My face is asymmetrical and sometimes I think I look like gollum. 

I'm thinking of getting plastic surgery on my nose because it's just...huge. And right /there/. I have a very low nose bridge too, which means that I look weird wearing glasses. 

I apologise for this long rant, and I'm really looking for honest opinions as to how I look and whether I should get plastic surgery on my nose or not. I've been called 'cute' by peers but my college professor once said, ""If a guy calls you cute, he probably means that you're adorable but ugly."" So there. 

Thank you!

As the title says, I posted here on a different account a while ago (it has since been deleted). I was told by most people that I was the averagest of average people in averagetown. Some people told me that I should go to the gym. I took that advice to heart and lost about 50lbs. 

I have a hard time judging my own attractiveness level and my family and friends have an obvious bias. So I'll ask you, /r/amiugly... amiugly?

Oh, and if you want to see old pictures of me [here they are](http://imgur.com/a/zsSkO#0). I would just recommend that you pass your judgement before looking at the old pictures so that they don't skew your view of my current appearance in a overly positive light.

I guess I'm just wondering where I stand. I hang out with pretty much all girls but never have been called attractive by any of them. I'm 6'4"" and 200lbs. I've had one girlfriend (she broke up with me) and she was considered unattractive by many, so I guess that's kind of why I think I might be ugly. 

I'd love for any suggestions on how to improve myself. I know I should probably dress better: I've never worn anything other than jeans (or shorts in the summer) and a T-shirt to school and out and stuff. I just don't really have a style and don't know what to do. 

First picture is me after a mock trial competition, not really representative of what I normally wear obviously

Second is how I usually look, ignore the person on my shoulders. 

Third is me with longer hair

Fourth is the most recent shot with a shorter hair cut. I just took it, I apologize that I'm still in my pajamas.

I'm an 18 year old female who has never been in a relationship or asked out ever.  About a week ago I lost my first kiss to some boy at a party who I thought was nice and stuff but it turns out that he's just a player and not anyone I want to associate with in the long run. :(

Now, I'm gonna be truthful. I used to think that I was sorta average/pretty.  When I was younger and skinny, people used to tell me that I should model (I've always been tall). However, the past couple years, I've gained some weight. I'm not overweight but I'm not skinny anymore. I have a very athletic body and I hate it. I love the sports I play but I love the lithe look and very skinny girls.  Ever since one of my (male) best friends abandoned me earlier this year (I really liked him) and since that boy at the party last week was only using me, I've been feeling very down about myself. It also doesn't help that I'm 6'0"" and about 160 lbs. I'm pretty much the biggest of my friends in college by a lot. I just want to know if I should be feeling down about myself or if there are other reasons that I haven't ever been asked out.

I don't really have a style of dress, I just throw on what I feel like.  Whether that's really stylish or just comfortable depends on the day.  

I've only ever been asked out by desperate *males* whom I think get crushes on me just because I'm around all the time, not because they actually like me.  I have a strange kind of personality... I think I'm really nice, but I have a very sarcastic humour and at times I feel like I'm hard on the outside.  I have pretty serious and difficult to treat depression.  I really love science, specifically health related bio and chem.  When I said nerdy in the title, I meant NERDY.  I begged my parents to send me to science camp when I was 15.  I love kids, bunnies, sea otters, papercrafts, sewing, exploring and reading.  I explore basically like a kid would, except I can go by myself and do some riskier stuff.  I drink and smoke trees pretty rarely, but mostly because it`s costly.  I try to get out more, but my depression comes with fatigue that is just all-encompassing.  

tl;dr: I dress how I feel, I`m genuinely nerdy, I love crafts, have depression and just want to know what can be done.

I have a specific question too: Do you think I have a big nose?  If so, *how* big?  Please be kind but honest!

Till now those have been totally seperate entities.

 Whilst I enjoy my work etc its not who I am so thought a change of hair, style and such was in order to better reflect me. I started wearing glasses rather than contacts because well, contacts were a pain.

Im shy. I dont like looking in mirrors. I dont like photos. I feel like a gumpy wierdo, but somewhat paradoxically im proud of who I am even though I dont like how I outwardly appear. 

Last few months have led to weight-gain... im not uncomfortable with being larger now but most of the people I work with have commented that they think the hair, glasses and weight gain have turned me ugleh. With degrading comments about my alter-lifestyle, hair, weight and glasses being pretty common round the office now. 

Is this them not being down with my lifestyle? Or am I actually ugly now? as a shy and naturally worried person I am now paranoid that I am some kind of hideous outcast from the normal world. 

So. Reddit. I am looking for some constructive criticism and honesty. Has the haircut and weightgain been unkind to me? 

Are there any ways you can see of me incorporating who I am into a look which would be attractive?

Now that you've seen pictures, let me go ahead and say it: Yes, I am a transsexual, in case you couldn't tell. I'm transitioning from Male to Female so for any criticism you're going to give me, please apply it to me as if I had been born female.

I have had no surgeries yet and have only been on hormones (Estrogen and an anti-androgen) for 14 months. I started hormone replacement therapy at 19 years old.

The reason I came here for criticism is because I'm afraid all of the feedback I've gotten from friends and family or other trans people is too nice and ""sugarcoated"" because people don't want to hurt my feelings. My mom tells me all the time ""You look like a girl!"" but most of the time I have a hard time seeing it myself.


To those of you planning on replying:

* Please be honest and above all, be gentle. 

* Please use female pronouns because that is what I identify as. 

* If you could, please also tell me whether you gendered me as male or female when you saw my pictures, and whether or not you could tell I was transsexual or had ""suspicions"" (if you read my post before looking at the pictures, don't bother).

Please help me out. I can't take this any longer. I feel trapped, like my life is a prison, and nothing I do ever changes anything. I haven't felt happy in years. 

Instead of being the ""wonderful experience"" people talk about, college for me has been ""hell on earth"". I get great grades though, but I'm talking about never feeling loved ever in my whole life. I'm about to graduate next year and feel like my last chance is slipping away. My career path is notorious for having no women whatsoever and I still don't have the traction I need to make a relationship.

I'm a 24 year old male in college, about to graduate. I've never in my whole life had a girlfriend. I've been on a small number of dates (3-4?), but I've never got the impression that anyone has ever taken me seriously as a possibility, even on those few dates.

Read on if you want more info, or just respond to pics if you prefer:
--------------------------------------------------------

I used to be more shy, but I've got very good at meeting random new people and talking comfortably with them the past few years. However, none of that has ever changed anything.

The only universal in my life has been that no matter how good of a job I do or how much I try I am never worth more than the dirt I stand on to women and to many others in general. 

I get compliments on my approaches relatively often, but nothing ever follows through. 

My most typical experience is to just be completely ignored or to, for example, get a phone number but my calls are never answered. Also, it's quite common for me to be getting along well with a woman only to have her suddenly go silent and seemingly drop off the edge of the world, leaving me clueless. I don't do offensive things or anything, I'm quite sure.

I feel like the only explanation at this point is that people are judging me based only on my experience and that I must be ugly. How else could everything I've done by now have not worked? I've truly gone above and beyond and it gets me nowhere. If I was attractive than something would have worked by now. I could just go on and on with all the things I've tried: everything from meeting at least 1 new woman every other day for several years, to mutiple online dating sites, to finding local groups to attend, to talking to women in class (and getting along well too), but nothing ever works.

I've never had any real experience with love. I'm going to explode. This has tormented me for years. I can barely focus on school work. My whole college life and young adult life has been nothing but misery because of it.

Nobody give me any ""you need to love yourself before you can love someone else"" stuff. I've loved myself this entire time. I've been unwaveringly confident, calm, and compassionate. I've gone through this cycle literally hundreds of times now (i've kept count); this endless torture of never feeling respected or loved like every other human being around me and always only being faced with the endless silence and confusion.

When I ask women have told me either that I'm ""not ugly"", or on one rare occasion ""cute"" (with a significant hesitation and pause).

However, I think everyone's lying to me to be politically correct or to ""make me feel better"". I'm tired of feeling so utterly lost, hopeless, and alone. I deserve better than this. I've alreadly completely lost the joy of my young 20s and of my entire college experience... I can't live with losing anymore of it. I need something to change soon.

I need some help. Above all I need someone out there to actually give me a chance. I've never in my whole life been sure that anyone loved me. I'm passionate about life and my career (computer science, game development), but it all feels absolutely numb and meaningless these many years without ever being given a chance by anyone to feel the same way that others feel.

There's never been 1 day in my whole life that I've ever felt the kind of joy I see others experiencing constantly around me everywhere, with friends and with romantic partners. I deserve better. I've tried so very hard and been so very dedicated and have always maintained my personal integrity and sense of self work but nothing ever works. I want to scream. 

I constantly feel like my whole life and youth is slipping away from me and there's nothing I can do to stop it, despite me constantly trying to make things change with every fiber of by being and from the bottom of my heart.

Please help me. I can't take it anymore. In 24 years of living why is it I feel like I haven't ever even lived a week. My life is a prison that keeps me from happiness. People say love who you are and what you do, AND I DO, but none of that ever changes anything. People just keep giving me the same useless and cruel advice, telling me I just have to love myself when I already DO, and that I just need to meet more people when I already DO, and that I'm not ugly when everything I've ever been through and struggled with implies strongly that I am. But, the perpetual confusion and endless misery continues. I'm not trying to throw a pity party (that's another thing people tell me when I bring this up). I hate pity parties. I've just spent my whole life trying to make this work and it never does. I NEED it to work. 

I can't take this anymore. I can hardly bear even one more hour of it. Please help me. Nothing I do changes anything. I've tried everything I can in my power to do and nothing happens. Nobody understands. I can't just wait this out the slow way like many suggest. That would be a disaster. I must be proactive, but everything I do means nothing apparently. Nobody will ever give me a chance. I can't do this on my own. I need someone to recipricate. It's a two way street. The only explanations for the lack of reciprication at this point with everything that's happened that makes any sense is that I must be ugly. 

I need someone to not judge me for my lack of romantic experience and see the truth that I just need to be given a chance. Or at least perhaps that's what I hope: that this is all some insane anamoly of behavior. But who can argue with hundreds of rejections? I've always loved myself and have been confident and calm but it hasn't ever worked. I've been emotionally starving for years. I need something to change. I can't take this anymore

Please help me.......

I am sorry for the post length, but I can't hold it back right now. I'm in constant mental agony over this. I need something to change soon. My life is hell and the only thing that it seems like could save me is if someone at last in my life shows me love and that I at long last get to experience even a single day of what everyone around me gets constantly. How can I end my misery?? Nothing makes sense. Attractive or unattractive? I don't know. There's only the endless torture and the fact that no matter what I do nothing ever changes. If it's a matter of skill, how can I learn to be better if nothing I've ever done has ever changed my results for the better. It's utter chaos. Every action I do is meaningless, meaninglessjust like me in the eyes of everyone in the world it seems, regardless of how much I love and have confidence in myself. Every time there seems to be hope it is smashed. Every time a trust, I am betrayed. Everytime I think the hell might end it doesn't. I can't do this anymore... It's killing me. My life is wasting away and nothing I do does anything to stop it.............

What's true and what isn't? I don't know anymore. I've never been loved... I'm spinning my wheels on ice. I can't escape. I'm stuck in this prison that is my life. Why doesn't what I do change anything? It doesn't make sense. It should have worked by now. Will my misery ever end? I deserve better... What can I do? I don't understand. Nothing makes any sense. I""ve longed my whole life for compansionship and have never had it. Everything only leads back to more pain. Will I ever have a day where I get to feel loved by someone? It seems like I won't...

I don't know what to do... or what to think... or even what's real and what's not...

*EDIT*

I forgot to mention. It is absolutely my mission to help other kids going through low self esteem problems out of their rut. In a certain sense, I see what life has given me as a gift.

It might sound twisted to some, but I handle it well. I am not depressed over my acne, I'm still a cheerful guy in spite of it.

I say it is a gift because it gives me a platform to speak out to kids who are suffering low self esteem, and help them through their troubles. Low self esteem is *serious*. Very serious. It can lead to depression which is bad enough, but can also take you towards making bad decisions that will affect your life permanently out of augmented peer pressure which is bad enough already without the low self esteem.

So to all of you here on amiugly, I want to say right away. Life is good. Life is good if you embrace it. Smile, enjoy yourself, don't let it eat away at you. I know it is hard, but never stop smiling.

All I can see are flaws and it kills me. (ex: My arms are fat, my neck has a crease from where my chin used to be, my thighs are fat, I have no ankles, my lips are dumb, etc) People stare at me in public and I tell myself it's because I have piercings and weird hair, but I always worry it's because I'm a hideous troll and they're mentally taking me down a peg. Like, ""Girl, you ain't all that. Look at all that &lt;flaw&gt;. You think you're hot shit but you're not."" It makes me so anxious I don't like being in public at all (especially not where trendy young people might be), and I flat-out refuse to wear shorts or short sleeves.

I think I might have body dysmorphia. I've lost so much weight but I still just feel like a total fatfuck, and I can't look in the mirror without zeroing in on the things I hate. Friends tell me I'm gorgeous and they have no idea what I'm talking about. But that makes me think they are lying to spare my feelings. And, let's be honest, no one who says nice things gets to see the loose skin and flab that I know is there under my clothes.

I guess that would be me at my most feminine? Dress and lipstick.  


I like dressing up, it's just I can't seem to pick out normal clothes that flatter me much (plus I share almost EVERY SHIRT I OWN with my boyfriend, so we end up buying small men's sizes). I'll ask around the fashion advice boards a little, thanks to everyone for their input. I hate people who can't just give it to me straight, and there was a lot of good tips here.

There is something that has been bothering me for awhile concerning the issue of having ""tact"".",Paramorgue,91,57,83,http://www.reddit.com/r/amiugly/comments/mgsel/hi_america_there_is_something_that_has_been/,"So I have been in this subreddit for awhile and I find it to be a great subreddit. Most of you seem to be great people that give good, and constructive, criticism. One big issue I do have is that the definition of ""tact"" is defined from the American standard of how to look. Problem is America, you are fat(I'm from Sweden and have lived/traveled a lot in the states). SOO many posters are overweight here and you guys just seem to accept it and talk about their eyeliner. It is not that the eyeliner wouldn't make it better but just ignoring the fact that the person is dangerously overweight just baffles me. It horrifies me as a swede to see someone post in AIU when, if they would be living in sweden, they would probably be THE biggest person in a city of 100 000 inhabitants.

So what I am saying is that many of us non-americans seem to come off as douchebags and get downvoted when the fact is we have never met a person that big in our whole life. It is difficult to be ""nice"" to someone who passed the chubby level 50-100 lbs ago. I want to put up some examples but that would just be wrong to the posters ""tactwise"". Just look at the front page and you will probably find at least one. 

Many ask for us to be ""brutal"",""hit me with it"" and ""do your worst"". Posters please don't ask for that. In the states you might not be that different from others, unfortunately, but in Europe you would be the biggest person someone might ever have seen.
Another thing is also the fact that we ""brutal"" people are normally the ones that are wrong. When someone tells a girl that weighs over 200 lbs that she needs to loose a ""few"" pounds. In the rest of the world she crossed that ""few"" line at 160 lbs. 

We just had a mod-post concerning us downvoting sexy people and telling them to go to AmISexy. If we can do that to good looking people my personal opinion is that we should do it to overweight people too. But to r/loseit.
It's harsh, I know. But these people have a serious problem and you're definition of tact makes it so that we can't tell them how severe it is.

I don't have a way to take a good body shot right now though, so I apologize for that!

I've had my hair short for the past 2 years and now I want it long again. So right now, it's kind of in that awkward in between stage. I haven't been able to get it trimmed in a couple months. It's driving me nuts! I usually tuck my hair behind one ear and pin it there, pull it all away from my face in a head band, or when I feel fancy, I flat-iron it all down.

I am self conscious about my teeth. They are very crooked because my family didn't have enough money for me to get braces when I was a kid. I'm hoping in the next few years to get the invisalign ones maybe.

So, I'm for the most part a happy person when I don't think about my looks. I work hard to keep myself in good shape and am pretty confident about my body, but I constantly struggle when I look at my face in the mirror. On my bad days, all I see are my big, fleshy, hooked nose, large forehead, bad skin, and so on. On a good day, I feel like I've got an average face, nothing particularly remarkable, but alright with the right makeup. I've decided to take myself to the anonymity of the internet to see what strangers with no investment in our relationship might say about my looks.

In short, I'm just looking for honest feedback on my appearance. Feel free to point out things you dislike/find unattractive even if they are things I cannot immediately change, but please try to be polite? I was picked on enough as a kid for the ""witch nose,"" so I'm hoping Reddit won't fail me now! Feel free, if you're so inclined, to put a number on it (the whole 1-10 thing); I think it could give me some insight as to how I compare to other women. Again, don't feel like you have to protect my feelings, as long as you're not outright mean...that would be a bummer.

I'm not necessarily here for feedback, as I am not really worried about how I look, but I was interested in seeing what people had to think about my story.

Here's one of the very few pictures of me in the 8th grade:
http://i.imgur.com/rDDav1x.jpg?1

I had just moved from a place where I was in a bad situation, no confidence, very awkward, viciously bullied, bad family life, and very little friends. I delt with that for 4 years.

I moved across the world to a whole new country, and in the next 2 years I began to change into a much more confident, outgoing,  involved person thanks to a good family life and close friends. 

Fast forward 3 years and in that time period I started really focusing on pulling myself together. I worked out, ate well, ditched bad habits, went 100% on hygiene, and really turned a lot around in terms of my looks. 

Socially, I joined speech and found out I had a real talent for voice, joined the play and found out I had a talent for acting. I went to many school clubs, helped found one, went to parties, met loads of people, went to dances, dated girls, got out much more, and overall was a whole new person.

Here's a barrage of pictures including me and my many hairstyles:
[Shaggy Hair](http://i.imgur.com/EFJBWjJ.jpg)
(About 7 months ago. I never grew my hair out, so one year I didn't cut it for a long time. Some people didn't like all the hair, but most people I knew did. I also liked it.)

[Less Hair](http://i.imgur.com/UWYnsUJ.jpg) (2 months ago. This is how it looks before it gets grown out in the last picture.)

[Present Day](http://i.imgur.com/JiKgKXO.jpeg) (Today. Here's a quick self-shot I took earlier to show off how I look now with my hair trimmed up. I might grow it back out. Thoughts?)

[Bonus: Makeup](http://i.imgur.com/0nWvoYP.jpeg) (Here's me, less than thrilled, wearing makeup for a play performance. Don't judge me!)

Through middle school, as if that time wasn't awkward enough, I started to get severe and cystic acne. For my whole eighth grade year I had the biggest cystic acne breakout right next to my nose. I took almost the whole year to go away and I swear it was almost as big as my nose. I cringe when I look back at those pictures.

Now that I'm in high school, I have had the occasional little flings with boys, but more times than not I have heard, ""she would be pretty if she didn't have acne,"" and usually a girl prettier than I am is chosen over me. A girl without acne. Even my mother on occasion will comment on ""how terrible"" my face has been looking lately. It has gotten much better as I am now on a prescription, but it is not perfect and I have many scars. I would looove to go on birth control for it as I have heard many success stories with acne being cleared by birth control, but I am highly prone to blood clots so this is out of the question. I wash my face three times almost everyday so I'd like to think the acne is not a hygiene problem, but one can never tell.

Basically I am putting my pictures up for all you Redditors to see because I am going to college next year, and I want to know if I am attractive enough to maybe get a boyfriend with the new start that I will hopefully receive. Also, I would like to know if any of you have any tips on my acne problem, or really anything else that I can do to improve my appearance. Thank you all!

Also, my contacts were bugging the shit out of my eyes as of late, so I got me some fancy glasses, hoping it may complement the lack of hair somehow.  So, glasses?  No glasses?

Feel free to critique or claim hopeless, ha.

The weight thing is definitely an issue, and I'm already addressing it. But otherwise, is there hope, so to speak?

I need improvement. 

Any suggestions would be helpful.

EDIT:

Wow! I woke up this morning to a bunch o' comments.

Thank you everyone for the advice.

I'm going to style my hair after I play a small part in an indie flick. I have to keep the long hair as I'm playing a gypsy. I'd like to cut it an maybe get a bob. I'm not a brunette anymore, I dyed my hair blue black.

Sunken eyes, yeah I've always had dark circles. Sleep is a big problem for me, but I'm going to try and get more sleep.

I'm not Indian, I get that alot. I'm Italian Australian. But yeah I'll try using a yellowish concealer, the makeup I use is minimal. I'll play it up a bit more and experiment with make-up.

As for the weight. I'm going to lose it. I'm sick of being a fat fuck. If I lose maybe another 12 I'll be voluptuous.
Right now I'm sitting at 96kg. 

My friend who picked on my nose has her own insecurites. She's heading off to Malaysia next year to get a boob job. I think she wanted someone to tag along with, which is where all this name calling started.
I'm going to love my beak more!
