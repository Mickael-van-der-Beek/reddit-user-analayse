1341450109.0,611,self.assassinscreed,w20ua,"Alright guys, let's squash the sentiment that Ubisoft is going to make Assassin's Creed 3 into a patriotic circlejerk right here. ",int3rcept,710,99,115,http://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/w20ua/alright_guys_lets_squash_the_sentiment_that/,"I usually post this in every Assassin's Creed 3 thread I find because some complaint about how the game is going to be thinly veiled ""AMURRRICAAA FUCK YEAH!"" is always the top comment. That doesn't bother me so much as the comments that follow, claiming that the American public is nothing but a bunch of flag-waving zealots that will protest and boycott anything remotely anti-American. Then the game these accusers use to defend themselves is Modern Warfare 2. Right, the same game where a 3 star American general turns out to be the grand villain and you play as a pair of former British SAS soldiers to take him down, killing legions of US special ops soldiers in the process.

So let me put the copypasta here and we can focus all the debate about patriotism onto this thread. I think all the mods here can agree that letting this place degenerate into a constant soapbox for self-loathing Americans and self-righteous non-Americans will not further or enhance any discussion of Assassin's Creed whatsoever. If we're going to duke it out, let's duke it out here. Keep the political and nationalist bullshit out of the other threads because it's really tiring. I come here to talk about Assassin's Creed, not to constantly correct posters who insist that Americans are close-minded consumers that can't tolerate any game that doesn't have fighter jets screaming through a sky filled with red, white, and blue fireworks above a scorched earth of brown people.

The follow is the copypasta:

I've posted this in other threads before. This is addressing the inevitable flux of people who will come in here and claim that AC3 will be a vehicle for American bias and propaganda:

* Strangely, no one leveled this sort of criticism against the first Assassin's Creed which was one of the most politically explicit of all the AC games. The Assassins were formally aligned with the Shiite Muslims while the Templars were mostly European Crusaders. There were no European or Christian Assassins in the game. Of course the twist in the end is that [Al Mualim, Mentor of the Assassin Order, turns out to be the ultimate villain](/spoiler ""Assassin's Creed 1"").

* If this game was set in the French Revolution, no one would be demanding an ""even"" view of the loyalists and revolutionaries. There's clearly a chip on someone's shoulder when he suddenly becomes critical just because America is the area of conflict.

* The trailers and artwork prominently feature the Betsy Ross flag because the game is set during the American Revolution. It's immediately recognizable and eye-catching. If Ubisoft made an AC game set during the Bolshevik Revolution and used [the Red Banner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_flag) for cover art, I doubt people would get riled up and accuse Ubisoft of pandering to the communist agenda.

* You can see in this [trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pUhraVG7Ow) that Connor is indifferent, even hostile, to the colonists and their cause. ""They speak of liberty and justice... But for whom?"" He shoves his way callously through Continental soldiers because his only concern is reaching his target.

* Killing a bunch of weekend warrior minutemen doesn't make your protagonist look badass. Dismantling a finely trained unit of professional redcoats makes your protagonist look badass. 

* Speaking of the Continental Army, they had their asses completely handed to them in the aforementioned trailer. Not a very favorable portrayal of Americans.

* The game takes place over a period of 30 years, spanning before, during, and after the Revolutionary War. Anyone who has learned US history would know that British troops and Hessians would be the ones patrolling and guarding towns before and during the war, thus the great majority of enemies Connor kills would be redcoats, British Templars, and probably some colonial Templars with loyalist sympathies. Connor's targets *after* the war would be American templars guarded by American soldiers since the British are expelled by then, but it would be stupid to create trailers of the final chapters of the game for obvious reasons.

* As another poster mentioned, revealing the American revolutionaries that Connor kills would be big spoilers. So far all we've seen him kill are unidentified British officers.

* If Connor wasn't allied in some way with the colonists then where could he find safe haven? Again, no one seemed to care that Altair killed loads of Christians in AC1 because the Muslims are seen as underdogs. They're the natives and the Europeans are the invaders. The colonists in this game are placed in the same position. The Assassins always support the cause of the common people.

* Though its association with the United States is convenient, the bald eagle in the [trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pUhraVG7Ow) isn't some tear-jerking American sentiment. Notice how as the eagle disappears into the canopy of trees, Connor bursts out in its place. The eagle is part of an on-going theme that portrays the AC protagonists as [birds of prey](http://static.gamesradar.com/images/mb/GamesRadar/us/Features/2009/04/Assassins%20Creed%202%20trailer%20secrets/EagleShadow--article_image.jpg). All their hoods have a tapered tip that's reminiscent of [a beak](http://www.vis-atk.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/ezio_eagle.jpg). Connor's hood takes this a step further by actually placing a [stylized stitching of an eagle on the beak](http://images.wikia.com/assassinscreed/images/5/53/Assassin%27s_Creed_3_-_Connor_concept_art_by_Lewa.jpg). Even their names are allusions to birds. Altair means ""the flying one"" in Arabic and Ezio is an Italian name derived from the Old Greek word for eagle. Connor is the only one whose names don't evoke any avian influence. Ratonhnhaké:ton means ""the spirit lives"" in Mohawk and Connor means ""lover of hounds"" in Gaelic, but AC 3's emphasis on making Connor feel like a predator probably pushed the design team to inject more of a lupine feel into him. He's portrayed as both an eagle and a wolf. Also, the trademark vision mechanic of the series is called [Eagle Vision](http://assassinscreed.wikia.com/wiki/Eagle_Vision).

* All the AC protagonists maintained some sort of light political allegiance. For example, Ezio had the support of Forli and Monteriggioni. The Syrians sieged Masyaf, but after Saladin withdrew, the Assassins had the support of the local population. Why would Assassins in Colonial America be any different and why is it so objectionable if it's clearly an ongoing theme?

* The Assassins always side with whichever faction is giving power to the common people. This is why in the lore, the Narodnaya Volya, the Russian branch of the Assassin Order, supported the Bolshevik Revolution but killed Stalin 40 years later. Although Stalin was a communist, he was also a Templar that tried to focus power within the elite and control the proletariat. Political and national affiliations mean nothing to Assassins. In the Revolutionary War, the colonists are the underdogs. Naturally, many of the Founding Fathers would be Assassins because they're breaking off from a monarchy that has power concentrated within the upper echelons of society. Once the United States is founded, this changes.

Have some faith, guys. Good faith is a resource. Origin gets a bad rap compared to Steam because Valve has a lot more good faith compared to EA. When you look forward to a game or some decisions look questionable, developers cash in on that capital of faith. DRM concerns aside, Ubisoft Montreal has always done right by me. In my opinion, Ubisoft and Rockstar easily have the best writers in the industry. I doubt they'd change gears so suddenly.

Look at [all the shit this franchise has produced](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin%27s_Creed). There are five games in the main series alone with a slew of supporting comics, smaller platform games, movies, and books. They've had many opportunities to pander and sell out but they haven't. If anything, the games are biased towards a leftist and Assassin perspective while the supplementary media highlight some of the very negative qualities of the Assassins while showing the Templar Order in a more sympathetic light. Believing that Ubisoft would abandon this design direction simply because the game is set in America is insulting to the company and quite frankly reveals a lot of bigoted, preconceived notions of what American fans of the series want.

By the way, the lore states that Franklin Roosevelt was a Templar that conspired with fellow Templars Winston Churchill, Adolf Hitler, and Joseph Stalin to start World War II. Let that sink in for you. Assassin's Creed says that FDR, consistently voted by scholars as one of the greatest presidents of all time, was a mass-murdering conspirator that worked with Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin to engineer the bloodiest and most horrific war in human history in order to form a new world government.

That doesn't sound like an American bias.",,False,,t5_2s6v6,1341618462.0,,,True,t3_w20ua,http://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/w20ua/alright_guys_lets_squash_the_sentiment_that/,

A lot of you complain that he isn't as flashy, charismatic and enjoyable a character as Ezio but I really believe that was done intentionally. Connor was born in a different time and was raised in the same luxuries as Ezio. Sure, Ezio was thrust into the world of Assassin's after he saw his brothers and father killed but he still had an emotional crutch in his mother and sister. All Connor has is his native land and his mother and from early in his life he sees both of those things threatened and taken away from him. How do you all expect him to be?

Once he meets Achilles, he is educated for the first time in his life and schooled in matters of the world outside his native camp. I am sure that his education, in addition to his assassin's combat training would also prove to be very overwhelming to someone like Connor. He has been criticized by some here for being too naive and unaware of the bigger picture. What more can we expect of Connor at this point? 

I think Connor's personality comes off the way it does because he is at a crossroads in his life. He does not necessarily want or like doing what he is doing but as he states himself he does it because ""nobody else will"". He is just a guy doing what he has to do all while finding his rightful place as an assassin. I think as the game goes on, he starts demonstrating a slow change from being the young boy with a grudge to a strong, bold assassin with a sense of duty and cause. 

Sorry for the long post. Thanks to anyone who reads my reasonsing/rant. I would love thoughts if you think this hasn't been beaten to death yet!

 TL;DR Connor isn't wooden and emotionless, he has had so much taken away from him and he is doing what he has to do to address this and move on. ",,False,,t5_2s6v6,False,,ps3,True,t3_13yrit,http://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/13yrit/in_defense_of_connor/,

Assassin's Creed III, the final installment (of Desmond's story) to a series we've been playing for 4 years is set to be released to the general public in 12 hours. Like many of you, I am highly excited for this. Also like many of you, I won't be getting it in 12 hours. I'm Australian, so I have to wait 21 hours. Other players around the world have to wait longer because they're behind me in the timezone, or because they're on a different system. PC gamers have to wait another 21 days. Then there's also the people who are simply unable to get it at the moment. Because of this, moderation is going to become stricter. 

From now on, any comments or posts containing details about ACIII without sufficient warning and spoiler tag coverage will be removed, and the poster will be banned. This is your only warning. **Bans will not be lifted**, so messaging us saying you forgot or you weren't sure how to tag will be ignored. **If you don't know how to spoiler tag, this is how:**

[text goes here]\(/spoiler)

Shows up as this:

[text goes here](/spoiler)

If you are using a mobile app such as Alien Blue, **spoiler tags are not supported**, so you will see everything. I suggest using the desktop site for the moment. However, any tags you add while using the app will show up for others. 

Also, **spoiler tags do not show up in the inbox**. So if you reply to someone's comment or self-post with tags, they will show up untagged in the person's inbox, so please be wary of this. 

And finally, remember that these rules aren't just for the next few days, but months. PC gamers must wait an extra 20 days, and any other people who wait longer for whatever reason as well, so don't just tag things for the next few days and stop caring. Keep vigilant for a long time. People still tag things from the other games, so try to do that for ACIII. 

As usual, please upvote for visibility

I won't say how, suffice to say that a very close friend of mine who lives down the road, got his hands on a copy of AC 3, here in the UK.  I'll leave it at that.  Edit - I would like to clarify this was on the 360.  Physical copy, not the torrent.

He called me to come round as he knew I was aching for the game's release.

I'm not trolling.  I'm not trying to write this to make it LOOK like I've played the game when I haven't.  This is no review, it's just a sort of heads up.  More so than what we've seen at Expos and E3 events.

He had just finished sequence 3 and was about to start sequence 4.

Obviously, no spoilers, but I can certainly summarize with this:

AC 3 is by far and away the single, greatest AC game to date, and will enter gaming history as arguably one of the greatest sandbox or free roaming games ever created.

Every single thing that I saw, over 2 hours, made my jaw drop.  The map of Boston is actually ALOT bigger than we currently think it is, surprisingly so.  I actually looked around and thought ""If it were just Boston and New York, this is a game in itself.)  The frontier is just OMFGNOWAI massive (childish I know, but god, it's so damn big), and is FULL.  Unlike Red Dead Redemption, there is SO much to do in the Frontier.  Animals are abundant, and the variety is crazy.  I didnt explore it all of course (no time), but god, I set a waypoint for something like 3cm away on the map from my location.  You have to move the map around to see the whole thing.

That waypoint ended up being like 400m away, and took me, what felt like, a good 10 minutes to run to it. 

Seriously, the frontier is MASSIVE.  And like I said, it's full.  You can go some long periods without seeing an animal, but clues pop up here and there which you can analyze, and like in RDR, animals can be found in specific areas (beavers for example (spoilers?) can be found by rivers, bears by caves and mountain sides etc).

The trees feel a little too well designed.  In free running aspects that is.  A bit too manufactured.  Like they've been placed to ensure there is always somewhere to free-run.  A little artifitial.

It's the little things though.  Rats run around in cities.  Squirrels can be seen in trees as you sweep through effortlessly.  Eagle cries.  The sound of snow under foot.  It's all amazing.

Oh, and Boston (didnt see New York) is the single, most convincing simulated city in a game I've ever come across.

EVERYONE is doing something.  Hustle and bustle makes the city feel alive.  Everywhere you look there is something to see.  Dust and fog sweep across the streets.  Winter changes everything.  The number of people on the screen in the cities is so realistic.  People are chopping wood, tending crops, feeding pigs, selling produce, bantering, cats and dogs roam around freely.  It's so realistic.

The frontier feels alive. Squirrels in the trees.  Animals huddle together.  Eagles soar and cry overhead.  Crickets in the grass etc.

Overall though, this is like the jump from AC 1 to AC 2, garnished with a dollop of GTA and Red Dead Redemption (convinced the Frontier map is the size of Red Dead's).  Even the homestead map takes 20 minutes to run across on foot.

The animations, the weather, THE GRAPHICS (jesus god the graphics, SO detailed AND SO SMOOTH, seriously, I saw 1 moment where the FPS dropped, but it was completely understandable as to why), the FREEDOM, the acting.

The combat is..gleefully and unashamedly, flat out BRUTAL.  Some of those moves just make you cringe.  There is so much variety in the moves, and the double kills are by far the coolest aspect of the combat.  I burst out laughing at one double kill at the sheer awesomeness of it.  The intro of the human shield ability, the fluidity of attack combos, combat can be difficult, but still easier than I thought it would be (never died in combat, and the gun volley needs to have its' damage increased in a patch.  Its the only disappointing thing I noticed.  5 guys shoot you at the same time and you lose like 1/4 health unfortunately.  It's couldnt be made more obvious when they're about to shoot, but its still possible to get hit by them easily.  If no one is near you, you're in trouble if your health is low as you cant dodge the volley.)  Unarmed combat is awesome and there is some great bone snapping animations.  Guns take SO long to load, to the point where you basically cant reload in combat.  Understandable though, as guns back then were notorious for long reloading.  Force the swab down the barrel, then the bullet, then the gun powder etc etc.

There are no limbs flying everywhere and guts spilling out or anything that bad, but the brutality and strength of Connor in combat is nothing short of barbaric, yet somehow incredibly graceful.  He can lift 2 guys off the floor at the same time and smack them down like something out of a wrestling match.  He moves with such confidence, such strength, yet can dodge and counter almost every attack if you get your timing right.

But those graphics.

They're bite-the-back-of-your-hand beautiful.  Seriously.  We had a moment on a tree branch, on the top of a mountain-like range, just squatted, Assassin style, spinning the camera around slowly, just looking at the scenery below.  0 effect on the FPS.  The draw distance is obviously limited by the console hardware (trees far in the distance look a bit..well...drawn 2D), but I was still damn impressed.  It was like playing stock Skyrim all over again without the graphics mods etc.

There were some weird horse spawning glitches, some weird attack animations where the elevation difference was apparent, where the attack animation would stop but the target would still act like he's being hit in a combo then just fall dead.  Some cut scenese had glitches in them that really stood out, clothing clipping through objects, weird shadows, fluctuating lighting in the same camera angle.  But I guess these can be ironed out maybe in a future patch.

For those that DONT care about the graphics though, I..it...

I'll just say this:  Based on what I saw in my, granted, slightly limited time playing the game, the wait has seriously...

SERIOUSLY been worth it.

He quietly walks up to the his target, stabs him in the back with the hidden blade, and casually walks away with the girl. But one thing I noticed after reviewing the trailer for the 20th time is that Captain Kenway has **NO WEAPONS** on him aside from his hidden blade. No pistols and no dual swords. I assumed it to be a mistake, but as I thought about it more I thought that maybe he is trying to attract less attention to himself. And I remembered reading in the IGN article about how the notoriety system would be completely different. I was thinking that maybe somehow you could choose to carry more or less weapons and this might effect your detection rate or notoriety. Maybe a guard will react less to a guy with just a knife and an unseen hidden blade than to a guy with 2 swords, 4 pistols, and a blow dart gun on his back. If Ubisoft is actually implementing this, then I think this would be amazing and would encourage more customization and variety in gameplay; you could be the quiet stealthy guy or you can go in guns blazing and drop everyone in sight.

* So for starters you have a main weapon, and a tool equipped at all times. My prefered combo is the original Assassin Tomahawk and a pitsol.


* While in combat, you can press X (Square) to attack with your primary weapon, Y (Triangle) to attack with your tool, A (X) to break their defense, or hold down B (Circle) to parry their attacks.


* So, when you're in open combat,  especially when you're with a group of people, you're gonna have to do quite a bit of counter-attacks (plus, that's where all the cool moves and combos are). 


* When an enemy is about to attack you, a red triangle will appear above his head. Tap B (Circle on PS3) to block the move. This will bring you into a slowmo animation. Now you choose how you'd like to counter their attack. You can press:

          * X (Square) to use your main weapon
          * Y (Triangle) to use your tool
          * B (Circle) to throw them
          * A (X) to disarm them

* If 2 enemies are attacking you at once, you need only tap B (Circle) one time, and you will automatically counter-kill both in a sweet little animation.

 
* The problem a lot of people are having, and I had for a while, is that people are used to holding down RT (R1) to block in combat. You don't need to. In fact, it hinders more than it helps. What I've found while playing, is that if you hold down RT (R1) while in combat, you can block enemies' attacks and go into the slowmo animation, but the game doesn't allow you to follow up with any of the 4 buttons (X, Y, B, A / Square, Triangle, Circle, X). The only exception I've found to this is when fighting with the hidden blade. Then, it doesn't matter if hold it or not.


* Some people are complaining that they *always* throw people when they counter, this is a result of pressing B (Circle) twice. Just take your time and slow it down. There's no rush to press the second button quickly after you press B the first time; that's what the slowmo animation is for.


* The only thing holding down RT (R1) is useful for is when you want to pick up a weapon on the ground in the middle of combat.


* Now, when a YELLOW icon appears above an enemy's head, it means they are about to attack you in a way that can't be blocked. Usually it's either someone about to shoot at you, or a Grenadier (The big guys with backpacks) about to perform a heavy attack or throw a grenade. If someone is aiming a gun at you, quickly move toward the nearest enemy and tap A (X) to grab him and use him as a human shield. If it is a heavy attack, just tap B (Circle) once, and you will roll out of the way; usually you roll behind him, so if you're quick you can assassinate him from behind with X (Square). If it's a grenade, press RT (R1) and run away from it; they don't have a very big blast radius. I'm not sure if there's anything you can do with the grenades, like maybe throw them back or roll away; there might be. I've only had grenades thrown at me once or twice, so I haven't really gotten to play around with them yet.


* Tougher opponents, such as the grenadiers, Jagers, and the captains, can't always be killed with regular attacks or regular counter-attacks. You'll have to mix it up. Try countering with your tool, or attacking from a distance with a ranged weapon. Your best bet is to usually either break their defense with A (X), or counter-disarm them and then quickly pick up the weapon they dropped before they can pick it back up.

Twenty years ago my parents divorced, there was a pretty brutal custody trial between my mother and father over who would go with which parent. 

In the end my father took my brother and I stayed with my mother. 

Move forward those twenty years and the two of us hadn't seen each other in so long. He would try and send letters but my dad would never mail them, I would try and my mother would do the same.  So we never knew the other was still alive.

Having been tracked down by my brother we began talking online and getting to know each other again. He and I are both gamers and the topic of assassin's creed had come up many many times. I told him it was one of my favorite series. (His own being Dragon Age)

Two days ago I come home from work to find two large boxes sitting on my porch. On the box was a drawn assassin logo.

These were inside.
[ The things he sent me.](http://imgur.com/a/WsKfb)

Along with a picture of him and his family. 

He and I bonded again over Assassin's Creed and we're going to meet in a month.

TL;DR : The brother I hadn't seen in 20 years and I bonded over a game and he sent me cool shit.

EDIT: We're going meet in two weeks instead of a month. 

And for anyone that wants to know here is the rest of that shelf.

756 years ago, the most legendary assassin died, on a chair, in a room, all alone. He sat there for his belief in his creed, for the future and for the Assassins.

That man... suffered a lot. He never knew his mother, his father was taken away from him when he was but a child. His close friend became his biggest enemy. He was betrayed by the only father figure he had in life and had to end him. He made the order stronger... only to have to have it taken away. His son was murdered, lied to that his father ordered his death. In rage his actions indirectly also led to the death of his wife.

Yes, that man suffered... however it is because of that man the Assassin order lives. He accomplished in life something not many men could ever hope to and brought about a revolution in the ways of the order. The work done by that one man has echoed through centuries.

The upgrade in gameplay from 1 to 2 was astronomical. When brotherhood came out, people started asking me if AC was a good series. Obviously I responded, ""THE BEST EVER!""


They'll ask if they should start from the beginning or go to the latest game. 

""This isn't Starwars, fool! You gotta play it all!""


But AC1 always turns them off from the series. At the time, I loved the game but now when I try it again, I can really understand why it was so criticized. 


The gameplay and story is extremely repetitive compared to the others and the world seems so dead. NPCs walk around like zombies and I often found myself just killing guards out of boredom. The endgame is practically nonexistent, too.


Now I just recommend that they start at 2 and only play 1 if they really want to.


Altaïr is supposed to be one of the grandmasters, yet if you want to learn anything about him, you'll find out more in Revelations.


Any thoughts about it? Would anyone else enjoy a remake at some time? Maybe when Ubisoft finishes the main saga that they have going on right now?


**Edit: So it has been about a day since I posted this. I honestly didn't expect it to be popular and I DEFINITELY  didn't expect the responses.**


**TL;DR (the comments): Less than 5 Yays v. A billion Nays, Ubi should wait at least 5 years before they do decide to release it if they did, and the most surprising of all, future games should actually try to be more like AC1.

This is a friendly message / reminder that posting AC3 gameplay prior to the release date will be removed. As of right now, we're going to limit this to single player only, but if the community wants MP content silenced until the 30th then we will enforce it as necessary.

Furthermore, another reminder that posts involving AC3 that contain spoilers that are not clearly labelled will be removed.

As an aside, please don't forget to report posts that break the rules and guildlines of the community. It doesn't bother us and is actually a great way to help us make our jobs easier.

That's all the news I have for now, so stay safe and try not to get assassinated prior to your respective release date.


PS: Please upvote for visibility. It's a self post so no karma!

EDIT: Due to some great suggestions and feedback in the comments, I've decided to turn the subreddit into self post only mode until the end of November. You can still submit all the same posts (guidelines still apply), but it will have to be in a self post.

**Part 1**: The Old World

The game opens in 1792. Connor is on his way to France, having been called there by his old friend, the Marquis de Lafayette. The Marquis, sensing the growing trouble in his native country, had attempted to flee back to America but was imprisoned. Knowing no one else in the world has the same skills, Lafayette has asked for Connor's help in escaping from his captors, a kindness Connor is willing to show given Lafayette’s past efforts.

However, upon arriving, Connor finds that the Marquis has been taken to a secret prison inside Prussia (modern day Germany) and his precise location is unknown. Marooned in France with no way to get back, Connor becomes swept up in the revolutionary fever. Surrounded by French rebels who call out for liberty, equality, and brotherhood, he becomes an object of curiosity – an American Indian in France during its most tumultuous period. 

Noticing the insignia on his tomahawk, the European branch of the Assassin Order contacts him and has him help take care of some Aristocrats with Templar connections. These Assassins fervently believe in the Revolution and especially its leader, Jean Robespierre. Connor, having been disillusioned by General Washington’s policies against Native Americans, is unsure of any man who comes preaching sudden, radical change. Connor stays in France, and attempts to cool to violence of the revolution. He has matured since his thuggish youth.
 
 
 
**Part 2**: The End of the Assassins

In October 1793, Connor is present during the trial of Marie Antoinette. He is disgusted with the way that the crowd treats her, he realizes that the revolution has become mob rule. When she is guillotined, and her body defiled after the execution, his anger becomes too much. 

He sides with the broken Girondins, the revolutionary group which advocates gradual change but which has been largely destroyed by the Jacobins. Befriending secretly alive Charlotte Corday and fellow American Thomas Paine, they begin a counter Reign-of-Terror, targeting the corrupted European Assassins and the powerful politicians in the new French Republic. It culminates in 1794, with Connor killing Robespierre and Saint-Just during the Thermidor Reaction. 
 
 
 
**Part 3**: A New Leader

Returning to his original mission, Connor is able to locate Lafayette in Madgeburg, Prussia. However, the prisons of King Friedrich Wilhelm are too great and Connor cannot free his friend. He returns to France where he meets a man esposing egalitarian principles similar to his own. This man, born in a remote and poor French province, has risen from the lowest ranks of the aristocracy through his military and tactical genius and, before the age of 30, is now one of the most powerful politicians in France. Connor quickly befriends and becomes a staunch ally of Napoleon Bonaparte, helping eliminate Templar based rivals who seek the position of First Consul.

In 1797, using his influence, Napoleon simply asks the Prussians to free Lafayette, which they do. The Marquis becomes a powerful ally, using his widespread fame to help Connor find new military technology to improve his combat skills and the abilities of his ship, the Aquila. Connor attempts to become Napoleon’s chief advisor, but finds Napoleon being seduced by a silver-tongued sycophant named Talleyrand. Napoleon in 1800 becomes First Consul of France and immediately enacts a civil code which reforms the national administration, creates effective states, regulates public finance, abolishes all feudal privileges and slavery, and establishes public education. However, Talleyrand convinces Napoleon to dial back some of his reforms. 
 
 
 
**Part 4**: A Free Haiti and the High Seas

In 1802, Napoleon legalizes slavery in Saint-Domingue. The Haitian Revolution starts as a result, and Connor has no choice but to fight for liberty against the leader he once believed in. He travels to Saint-Domingue and personally leads a naval blockade that destroys French supplies. Toussaint Louverture and Connor become fast friends, and Toussaint’s death by trickery at the hands of the colonists greatly angers our Assassin. Napoleon’s Polish troops fighting in Haiti, hungry and exhausted, begin to see the Haitian desire for self-governance as very similar to their own. They switch sides, turning the tide of the war permanently in the Haitians' favor. France has lost its revenue from Haiti’s sugar and is forced to abandon their dreams of a New World empire. Louisiana is sold to the Americans.

Connor’s skill on the seas has made him infamous, he’s contacted by his former enemies The British to help them defeat France’s navy. Meeting with Admiral Nelson, they plan to attack the French in the calmer waters of the Mediterranean, instead of the choppy Atlantic. Two hundred years before, Spain had lost its entire fleet in a poorly planned attack on Britain ruined by a storm. Nelson is determined that England will not repeat Spain’s mistake.  In 1805, Connor and Nelson attack the combined French and Spanish forces at Trafalgar. Nelson is killed early in the battle, forcing Connor to take command of the Navy. Leading a smaller fleet than the French, Connor dives into the sea and sneaks onboard the French flagship, the Bucentaure. He kills Admiral Frederico Gravina and captures Admiral Villaneuve. France will never rule the seas again.
 
 
 
**Part 5**: Mexico City, 1810.

**Part 6**: The fall of Napoleon 

Talleyrand has a secret meeting with Connor. For the first time in his life, the slippery diplomat is willing to tell the truth. He has always wanted what was best for France, which is how he was able to hold high positions of power for Louis XVI, the Revolution, and Napoleon. Talleyrand knows Napoleon has doomed France, the now-Emperor’s worldview poisoned by ego and his Templar advisors, Talleyrand wants Connor's help in destroying him. Connor reluctantly agrees, but first he is called back to the New World. 

It is 1812, and the Natives are being attacked by the American colonists who are seeking to expand the country's borders. The British have allied themselves with the Natives, hoping to protect their interests in Canada. Seeing an opportunity to end attacks on his people, Connor returns and joins the British against the Americans. He decides to attack the US at its center of power and leads an invasion of Washington, D.C. At the front of a superior British army, his position earned through his performance at Trafalgar, he torches the White House. His conversion to a nationless freedom fighter complete, he has made enemies out of the country he helped create.

Preparing to return to Europe, Connor is contacted by Talleyrand. Napoleon’s reign is over. Defeated at Waterloo, Napoleon has been exiled on St. Helena. In 1821, an aging Connor, now in his 60’s, makes his way to the tiny island in the South Atlantic. Sneaking onto Napoleon’s estate, he dispatches Napoleon’s elite private guard and confronts Napoleon in his bedroom. The old warrior is stronger than his years would suggest, he nearly kills Connor in the ensuing struggle. Finally, the Assassin is able to stab the former Emperor in the stomach. However, he collapses immediately afterward. 
 
 
 
**Part 7**: The Mentor

A nearly dead Connor is smuggled by British Assassins from St. Helena to the closest safe port. He ends up recovering from his wounds in Montevideo, Uruguay. Here he spends the rest of his days, an aging advisor to the reborn Assassin Order, made in Connor’s image, with no political allegiances or national identity. The order is small, their predecessors have been largely eliminated by Connor for their support of the Reign of Terror. It is in Montevideo that Connor discovers his greatest student, an Italian by the name of Giuseppe Garibaldi.

They'll stand in a line and knock you down if you try to slip by them. While sprinting towards stationary guards, target one of them, and then double tap the tackle button to make Connor roll between them. This works very well for fleeing conflict and is especially useful during chase missions.
 
•DOUBLE KILLS: To perform a cinematic double kill (not a double counter, as those are automatic upon block initiation), begin a killstreak (1 counter-kill plus 1 one hit kill). Once in the streak, target an enemy that is standing close to another foe. Angle and hold the left stick towards him, then double tap the tool button. As long as the two enemies are close enough (and you have a ranged or heavy tool equipped), Connor will execute a stylish double kill (using up 1 qty of the equipped tool). 

•DOUBLE ASSASSINATIONS: Double assassinations can be performed at any time using either the hidden blades or fists. To perform a low-profile double assassination, approach two guards that are close together (they do not have to be side by side for this to work). Target the first enemy simply by looking at his back. When you are ready to kill them, squeeze the right trigger slightly (you’ll see the other target light up) and tap the attack button. This will result in Connor killing both foes in a stealthy (yet fashionable) manner. To perform a high-profile double assassination, run towards (or pull the right trigger when close by) a pair of enemies and tap the attack button. This same procedure can be used for air and horse double assassinations.  
        
•NOTORIETY RESETING: Fast travel anywhere to reset your notoriety.
 
•SURVIVING ANY FALL: Fast travel while falling from high places to prevent desynchronization. 

•UNDERGROUND FAST TRAVEL: While exploring the Boston and New York undergrounds, you can fast travel to any point you discover to make backtracking faster. 

•FULFILL ALL MISSION CONSTRAINTS (Post-Epilogue): Animus hacks don't affect previous mission constraints and can be used to make memory replays easier. 
 
•FREE AMMO REFILLS: You can craft saddlebags for your horse that allow you to refill your consumables for free at any time. 

•TRIPPING ENEMIES: In combat against an enemy that you’ve disarmed, press the disarm button again to trip them for an easy kill. 

•SAVING DISPUTED CONVOYS: Your Assassin recruits can save any of your land convoys that are under attack. 

•CATCH FLEEING NPCS: Use the rope darts or poison darts to slow down enemies that run quickly. This will not kill them (instantly at least) and helps you catch up. 

•ANIMAL DISCOVERY: While completing the hunting map, investigating clues counts as a discovery for animals you haven't physically killed yet. 

•AVOIDING FIRING LINES: If you can't find a human shield in time, toss a smoke bomb (then use Eagle Vision for fun times) to block the enemy’s view or use a rope dart to pull the enemy towards you.
 
•REDUCE CONVOY TRAVEL RISK: Send supplies to the same merchant over and over to avoid increasing the risk on each convoy. For naval convoys, complete naval missions to reduce risk.
 
•EASY NAVIGATION: While sprinting, hold the jump button to vault over short obstacles quickly. Unlike previous games, you don't have to hold the right trigger to climb fast. Hold the tackle button while running towards gaps in obstacles to slide beneath them. You can fast travel anywhere in the game via the game map (zoom out then back in to another region). While falling, angle the left stick towards nearby grip holds to catch them.

Why are these questions still upvoted to the frontpage? Every day there's the same question and there's always the same answer:

**YES**, for comprehension of the storyline it is important to play *every single game*! If you don't care about storylines, buy the newest to date and be happy with that.

Just **stop posting** and more importantly **stop UPVOTING** these posts!

Search for *""should I buy""* in this subreddit and you'll get about 50 results, ONLY in this subreddit.

*""buy""* only gets about 270 results.

*""Haytham""* instead got 150 results.

Let's think about this..

**EDIT: Correct order of the main games:**

I had never seen a character of my specific racial makeup in the mainstream before, especially in my favorite sector: video games.

A buddy of mine at college had picked up the game on release day, and I went to his room to see how things looked. I was blown away to hear all the Mohawk language dialogue. I hadn't heard conversational Mohawk since my grandmother was alive because my grandparents would always speak to each other in Mohawk. I'm pretty damn impressed with the amount of work Ubisoft put into this game. I am loving all of the exposure Kanien’kéha is getting! The fact that this endangered language is now being played through the speakers of millions makes me very happy.

I've got the game now and I love it! I think I'm going to show my grandfather the beginning to sequence 4 (the hide and seek game) and see what he thinks.

Shout out to our European brethren who'll need to wait a day after the North American release.

Yes, Assassin's Creed has been and probably still will be released year by year, but it is by no means a ""Call of Duty"".

I for one haven't seen much improvement in the COD franchise since MW.

In fact, those games since then have been carbon copies of each other, bar from some new toys to play with. That's it.

Assassin's Creed, on the other hand, has been innovative from the get go and while the innovation has been exponentially dialed down, there is a clear uphill on the improvement and innovation chart when compared to COD.

AC has always been entertaining and even somewhat educational. The guys that work on the franchise have poured their hearts and souls into the projects and it shows. Comparing AC to COD solely on release dates is unwarranted and unfair.

I, for one, don't mind that at all, because I really care about the universe and the story and I'm invested. Yeah, I might not be picking the games up at launch, but to be fair I haven't done that since Halo CE.

Bottom line, I get what the controversy is about, but come on.

As much as I consider games an art form, they are also a business.

And this franchise has some of the brightest and ambitious minds, with so many creative ideas that we have never seen before in gaming that it would be a shame to let those ideas go to waste if they are expected to release a game every 4 to 5 years.

I welcome every new addition to the franchise and I try not to compare any of those games to anything else.

If we all did that, great titles like Lords of Shadow or Resistance, or even Injustice would never be played by anyone and never get the praise that they truly deserve.

Too long to read, I know, which is why most of you guys will probably never read this, but those are my two cents. I love COD and AC in no way am trying to call anyone a fanboy, but the levels of love for the two are different. In no way will I try to compare them to each other and say ""OH THIS FRANCHISE IS TURNING INTO CRAP"" just because AC is releasing every year.

AC has always tried new things, and will keep doing so. AC3 might not have been the best, but at least it had balls to stray from the formula just a bit, and that's more than I can say for COD in all respect.

There seems to be some common misconception that, here in the UK, we gamers are butt-hurt over the fact that we kill Redcoats in AC3. I haven't seen any other UK Redditors on this subreddit, and so I'm pretty much voicing for us all.

I promise you I haven't heard from a single person that they're upset about the fact that we kill our ancestors. I'm not offended. They were being assholes and they were trying to take over the world. That's not a Republic, that's a dictatorship. 

I'm a little mad, though. For those that don't know, the Limited Edition doesn't come with the cool flag like you Americans get because... Well, I don't bloody know why, really. It's frustrating to spend MORE money to get less (games here cost more in pounds than USD, I think it's roughly 75 USD for games here).

Either way, I just wanted to openly state this and get this out there because I've seen people bashing on the UK and UK gamers in general because we're all apparently really offended by this.

Since I was incognito and blended with the crowd, I walked up behind a soldier that was shoving someone and took him out with my hidden blade before walking away.

Here's my next movie. I'm going to be doing Revelations next, but it probably won't be out as quickly as this one was. I have a lot of schoolwork to do every week, and I will work on that before any more of the movies, so it just depends each week if I finish my schoolwork before the end of the week.

I edited a clip from The Lost Archive into the ending sequence, because I thought it would help improve continuity between this game and the next two. Let me know what you think about that.

There were compelling arguments from either side; ""this subreddit is for *all* things related to AC, including pictures and whatnot"", ""link posts have turned this subreddit into a wretched hive of scum and villainy"" etc etc. After giving it some thought, I have decided to **remove the ability to post links**. From now on, it will be self posts only. *However*, to keep the karma-lovers happy, I will not do this for 24 hours, so if you've got links, post em now. After this, you will have to post links in the body of a self post. 

The people in favour of removing require no explanation, but for those who think I'm a dick, here it is: owing to reddit's karma algorithm, top ranked posts aren't those which score the most karma, they're the posts which gain karma the quickest. What this means is that by reddit's very nature, the quick to digest images will *always* beat out anything that takes more than a few seconds to read and comment on, which inhibits anything thought-provoking or discussion-inspiring. With link posts, subreddits quickly turn into mindless holes, with the readers becoming rats at the feeding machine looking for their next hit. This is not what we want /r/assassinscreed to be. We want it to be a place where fans can come and share their love for Altaïr and talk about how Ezio is one of the most fully-developed characters ever created, we want people sharing tips on how to stealth kill an entire barracks without being caught etc etc. If you wish to post a picture of your desktop, do so in a self-post. It won't be removed. Same for anything you post that is directly related to the series. 

For those of you crying ""we want our funny stuff!"", I created /r/ACmemes just for you. It's a subreddit for any picture related to AC, including screenshots, photos, memes, rage comics etc. Moderation will be slim, apart from standard rule-breaking things being removed.

This is assuming I accept nearly everything Ubisoft did, right up to the point Desmond must kill himself. I think they could have handled it with *so* much more nostalgia and lasting impact by doing just a few simple things differently.

**---------**

Desmond knows his fate. He says his goodbyes to his father, Shaun, and Rebecca. Instead of Juno's lock Orb being right in front of them, there is a long, desolate yet ornate walkway ahead of Desmond. His friends and family slowly and sadly let him walk alone down the path.

Music starts playing. This music exactly (I'd open in a new tab as you read - http://youtu.be/qfFvOt5GPr8?t=2m29s). Sprinting becomes disabled and Desmond starts moving slower and slower. Suddenly, the Bleeding Effect starts taking place. To his left, he sees Animus-like flashes of Altair jumping through rooftops, assassinating key figures, and ending up with an Apple. The images fade. To his right, he sees a young Ezio scaling the rooftops in his first race. The images go very quickly, and soon he has the Assassin's Robes, and eventually he too holds an Apple. The images start flowing together towards the middle of Desmond's destination. Eagle vision becomes permanently on and all of the images of his ancestors coalesce at the center with an impossibly beautiful light. As Desmond gets closer, the light turns into an image of the sun, looking extremely unstable. There is almost a physical force pushing Desmond the opposite direction, but we know it is just his fear of his imminent death. Once he is close enough, the music stops, the images fade, his vision is restored. There is no sound, just an option to Interact with Juno's lock. Once the player presses Interact, Desmond immediately drops dead without any fancy light pillar or sacrificial honor. We know something happened in his mind, but we won't know exactly what.

As Desmond hits the floor, Juno looks up at the ceiling and smiles.

*I feel like this would be fairly easy to do in After Effects (just blue tinted, faint, quick montages of...hell, AC videos found on YouTube merged into gameplay of Desmond walking forward). Would be awesome to see someone make this a visual!*",,False,,t5_2s6v6,1352482198.0,,,True,t3_12wb5m,http://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/12wb5m/how_i_would_have_handled_the_ending_to_assassins/,

At least, not in the traditional sense.

They aren't so much sequels to AC2 as they are continuations. Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood could just as easily be renamed Assassin's Creed 2, Part 2. Revelations could just as easily be Assassin's Creed 2, Part 3. Assassin's Creed 2 didn't have an ending until 2 games later. It's like when a TV show has a ""To be continued..."" at the end. That episode's story has yet to reach a resolution. Same for AC2-ACR. It's all one story, with the climax being  the end of AC2, the falling action in ACB, and the resolution in ACR.

That's the same reason the next game is Assassin's Creed 3, rather than Assassin's Creed 5. Brotherhood and Revelations were 2;Pt2 and 2;Pt3, not 3 and 4.

So to everyone asking ""Do I need to play Brotherhood and Revelations? How much do they add to the story?"" Well, would you just watch the first third of a movie, and then watch the next movie in a series without finishing it? Of course you wouldn't, you'd have missed so much character and plot development, you wouldn't have much of an idea of what's going on. If you did only watch the first third, and went straight to the next one, you would, at the very least, read a plot synopsis or summary online.

**TL;DR Brotherhood and Revelations ARE crucial to understanding the story when you get to AC3. If you can't play them, watch a let's play all the way through, or at the very least read a plot summary. Stop clogging this board with questions of whether or not you need to play them.**",,False,,t5_2s6v6,False,,,True,t3_r5b0u,http://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/r5b0u/what_people_need_to_realize_about_brotherhood_and/,

1362191533.0,200,self.assassinscreed,19i2u4,Why AC IV: Black Flag is the right choice for Ubisoft....,IFeelLikeAndy,232,32,66,http://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/19i2u4/why_ac_iv_black_flag_is_the_right_choice_for/,"*I was skeptical about Black Flag, but after thinking of this, I'm very anxious. Hope this changes your perspective like it did mine!*

Assassin's Creed 1 followed Altair Ibn La'Ahad for a brief but important moment of his life and had an ending that nobody saw coming and wanted many people begging for more, so Ubisoft announced ACII. The second instalment was a surprise because it did not have Altair, instead it features Ezio Audiotre Da Firenze, whom we watched grow from *literally* the moment he was born, to a brash teenager, then into a brave man at the age of 40. The game ends at a very abrupt and strange moment in Ezio's life much like the first game's ending which was at a strange moment in Altair's life, so it wouldn't be a surprise if the next game didn't complete Ezio's story, but Ezio seemed more developed so another game was made featuring him as the main protagonist. 

Assassin's Creed Brotherhood was the next game continuing right where the events in ACII left off and helped build Ezio into a fully developed and lovable character. At the end of AC:B Ezio has finally gotten the revenge he's been seeking for all his life and his story was over, yet his story wasn't *really* over and neither was Altair's, so another game was developed to help finally put some closure on their lives. Thus, Assassin's Creed: Revelations was made and gave fans the closure both Ezio **and** Altair deserved, by letting player's experience first hand what they did with their lives after the events in AC1 and AC:B, whilst also adding to the main story and developing a game like no other.

With Ezio and Altair's stories now over a new protagonist was needed for ACIII, his name, Ratonhnhaké:ton, also known as Connor Kenway, son of Haytham Kenway. Without knowing, player's experienced Haytham's life for about 1/3 of the main story arc. While playing, we learn much about Haytham's life while also learning about Connor's mother, Ziio, his family, and heritage before he was even born. Many people instantly fell in love with Haytham because of how well his story was developed in such short time and left them wanting to know more about him but also making them anxious to play as the advertised protagonist, Connor. Once we finally do play as Connor, we experience his life from the young age of four and watch as the events in his life shape him into an Assassin. His story ends when he is 27 years old and already we know about his life and all about his parent's and their live's. The end of the game left us wanting more about his life after the Revolutionary War, but my theory is that all the excitement in his life ended when the war did, so another game would be of no service to us in developing his story because it's already over.

But Ubisoft isn't stupid, they know what their fans want so their plan is to develop Connor's story by telling us more about his heritage and where he comes from. The Assassin's Creed franchise has done nothing but tell us that **the events from our pasts are what shape our future's**. It's sounds like common sense but in the sense of Assassin's Creed, it could mean so much more...

***""What is a man but the sum of his memories?"" -Clay Kaczmarek (Subject 16)***

This is where Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag comes into all this talk about character development and the past. By letting us play as Connor's grandfather we will learn more about Connor's past as well as Haytham's, and Ubisoft is developing their characters like never before and possibly foreshadowing events that we already know will happen in ACIII. Who knows, maybe we will be able to play as young Haytham and see if he had father issues that made him want to neglect Connor the way he did in ACIII and develop their story's while also keeping the game going. Ubisoft wanted to make every fan feel closure by expanding of Haytham's life and Connor's at the same time. 

**tl;dr**
**Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag is Ubisoft's way of developing not only Connor's story, but Haytham's as well, by letting us learn more about their heritage and the events that lead up to their lives like no way ever done before in an Assassin's Creed game...**

Keep it spoiler-clean. I'll start:

* Fences with gaps in the bottom can be used to lose pursuers. Sprint at the gap and your character will slide under the fence.
* Holding A or B while sprinting lets you jump over small obstacles without climbing on them.
* You can only perform dual assassinations with the hidden blades or your fists. The easiest way to do this is an air assassination or a sprinting assassination (keep pressing ""assassinate"" as you sprint at your targets). 
* You can cancel broadside shots in the naval portions by re-orienting the camera forward. Useful if you don't want to waste a volley and wait for a reload.
* On a related note, the left and right cannons have separate cooldowns, meaning you can fire the right side and immediately switch to the left and ready a volley.
* The best way to defeat tougher enemies (who are resistant to counter) is by disarming them. On Xbox, press A after blocking.
* Alternatively, use the Rope Dart to yank them to the ground and insta-kill them. This works on all enemies.
* When using the rope dart, the enemy has to be facing AWAY FROM YOU in order to pull them to you. If you use it while they are facing you (even while hidden) you'll initiate combat and yank them to the ground.
* When you see the yellow triangle, it usually means someone's about to shoot you. Find a nearby enemy and press A (on Xbox) to use them as a shield. Works on all enemies.
* Powder kegs do heavy damage to allies!! Be very careful using them on missions where allies can take damage.
* You can reload your pistol while running, albeit a bit slower, and unable to do anything else at the same time.
* In naval battles, when using the ""take cover"" command to avoid damage, wait until the enemy fires first. If you take cover too early, the enemy will fire after you come out of it, and you'll take damage.
* While falling, you can hold B and use the D-pad to try and grab something. (Xbox)
* Animals will fuck your shit up if you let them. Get those button combos right.",,False,,t5_2s6v6,False,,,True,t3_138ffw,http://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/138ffw/gameplay_tips_and_tricks_you_wish_you_knew/,

*Onwards, gentlemen. No reason to dawdle:*

- Harpooning is tied to the progression system of Edward, which means that by harpooning you can upgrade Kenway. Also, you can harpoon different animals, not only whales. 

- There are 75 playas and sandbanks, small undiscovered beaches and areas full of treasures and content. 

- The naval world includes random events like dangerous storms. You will have to navigate very carefully, save crew members to minimize casualties and avoid lightning bolts.

- New aiming system in naval combat. Now you can control the height and distance of your shots, which is especially useful during storms to shoot over waves. 

- New “heavy shot” for naval combat. Deadly up close, but weak at a distance.

- New naval archetype, “the charger”. This ship builds up a lot of speed and then tries to ram you, so you don’t want to be close to it. The best way to destroy it is the mortar, the longest ranged weapon at sea. Aim with the spyglass for maximum accuracy and then shoot. 

- Your crew is very important. You mainly need them for naval combat and boarding, and they’re fully upgradable. If you don’t have enough crew to board the bigger ships, you will fail. You can hire new crew in taverns, finding them in deserted islands (“shipwrecked sailors”), saving them from hostile situations,… 

- You can find collectable songs that you can get your crew to sing in your voyages.

- Spaniards and British are hostile to each other the whole game, because even when they were supposed to be at peace, there were tensions between them. When their ships cross each other, they will battle. You can help one side, the other, or attack both if you are powerful enough.

- Your first mate is a big black man called Adewale. If he sees anything potentially interesting to you, he will point in the direction and tell you whatever is happening there. Is up to you to take advantage of the situation or ignore it. 

- Forts can be taken down with your ship, or stealthily infiltrating them. Once their defenses are down, you have to kill the captain of the fort.

- In plantations, you have to find the owner and steal a key to get access to his resources and cargo. You can approach this places guns blazing, but it will be highly difficult. It’s easier to use your stealth, but if you get detected bells will ring and you will be surrounded by new types of enemies.

- Guards will be tougher than in any previous AC. “Gunners” are so deadly, that you will want to take them out from behind or just avoid them at all cost. 

- You can now free aim with your guns. If you want to kill your enemies quickly, try headshots as much as possible. If you don’t want to attract attention to yourself, use the blowpipe instead. The blowpipe is upgradable, which means there are different types of ammo. You can put your enemies to sleep, poison them and make them go berserk,… If you poison them, they’ll attack anyone they see, including animals or their own friends.

- There’s no brotherhood(assassin recruit system), because it doesn’t make sense in this setting and with this character, and it would have made Edward too powerful. Instead, you have to take care of your pirate crew. 

- When Edward starts being trained by assassins, he is still not sure if he wants to really help them or not. 

- The main islands (Cuba, Jamaica and New Providence) aren’t 100% explorable, but there are “pockets” of land that you can explore, especially in Cuba. You can’t go too far into the interior, tough. 

- Port Royale is in the game, close to Kingston and fully explorable. 

- The whole world opens to you after about an hour into the game. It’s done this way to make sure the player won’t feel overwhelmed at the beginning.

- There are LGS o “linear game sequences”. Some of these missions take place outside of the Caribbean.

- When you plunder a ship you can make it part of Kenway’s fleet, and then manage your fleet to trade goods outside of the Caribbean (pretty much like naval trading in AC III), and also send them to plunder in other parts of the world for you. 

- When you go to a random island a message pops up telling you what is hidden there, so you can decide whether it’s worth finding it or not. You can turn off this option if you want, to make things harder. 

- If you’ve been to a place, you can always fast travel there. Also, if you synchronize with a high point, you can teleport to that particular point whenever you want. If you want to get back to the Jackdaw quickly, look around for row boats and avoid swimming.",,False,,t5_2s6v6,1371212715.0,,pc,True,t3_1gbug2,http://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1gbug2/ac4big_info_drop_here/,

Finally finished with the series! (for now)

I tried my hardest to make this movie shorter, but there's a lot of story to tell in this game, so I couldn't make it any shorter than I did without sacrificing story. I even cut out some entire scenes, such as the boat scenes in the beginning and recruiting Hickey and Pitcairn, as well as a lot of the stuff with young Connor. I also trimmed down Desmond's missions quite a bit. I ended up cutting over 20 minutes from my original edit, but if I cut anything else I'd likely be sacrificing storytelling.

One scene I debated cutting out was Connor's argument with Haytham on the rooftop, because the scene before and after would have edited together really nicely, and anything said in that scene is technically said elsewhere as well, and not vital to understanding the story. However, I thought the acting and character development in that scene, as well as its importance to the themes of this story as well as AC as a whole made the scene too important to cut.

* It's not ""Altiar,"" it's ""Altaïr.""

* It's not ""Enzio"" or ""Etsio,"" it's ""Ezio.""

* It's not ""Haythem"" or ""Heytham,"" it's ""Haytham.""

* It's not ""Conner,"" ""Connar,"" or ""Conor,"" it's ""Connor.""

* Ratonhnhaké:ton *never* adopted the name ""Kenway,"" only ""Connor.""

* The Animus is not a time machine that allows you to change the events of history. Remember, you *have* to keep things relatively historically accurate to stay synchronized with your ancestor.

* You need to *[EDIT:] have the DNA of* a direct descendant of someone to see their memories in the Animus. This means that, as long as we're still using Desmond's DNA, there would be a low chance that we would have a game focusing on Jenny Kenway, for example.

* Altaïr actually could swim, it was just that the Animus Desmond was using during AC1 didn't support swimming.

* The ""Creed"" shouldn't be used when referring to the Assassins. The Creed is the set of rules they follow, *not* the Order itself.

* The Assassins aren't ""good guys.""

* The Templars aren't ""bad guys.""

* Ezio and Altaïr are NOT related. *EDIT: See [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46FRp7dIn80) for an explanation on Desmond's ancestry.*

* AC4 *will* have loading screens. They will at least appear when entering and leaving a major city.

* Ubisoft doesn't only spend a year making these games. Different large teams work on different games at the same time.

* In terms of World War II, making the major powers of the war be in an ""Assassin vs. Templar"" conflict would be wrong because (in AC lore,) the war started as a Templar plot and none of the major forces were Assassins. Read more about it [here.](http://assassinscreed.wikia.com/wiki/World_War_II#Templar_influence) Speaking of World War II...

Perhaps I just clash with his personality? On the other hand playing Ezio made me happy and intrigued me. Sure he had some quirks, but he was fun.

I feel Connor to be an unlikeable character. Thoughts?

EDIT** YES. YES Yessss. **I get it.** We've had 3 games with Ezio. **I know.** I've played them all. To make a note of that so I don't repeat myself yet again. 

I liked Ezio's character right from the start in AC2. I did not need Brotherhood or Revelations to re-enforce that connection/admiration.

Runtime: 182 minutes

I'm the same guy who created the [Uncharted trilogy movies](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBAF6C25C590C7FE5) that were popular on reddit about a year ago. I will also be making movies for Brotherhood, Revelations, and AC3, and eventually AC4. 

I have some ideas for other series, but you can give me suggestions if you want. I'm primarily sticking to series that have a cinematic feel to them to begin with, typically with motion capture acting. Some games I'm currently considering for after I finish AC3 are the Batman series, Tomb Raider, or the Last of Us. 

One thing I want to note, that I immediately regretted, was that I cut everything regarding Caterina Sforza. I thought her storyline was subpar compared to the rest of the story, and the two DLC sequences distracted from the main plot too much, and nothing much was missed by skipping them. So after editing the movie I was okay cutting them, but then, as soon as I started work on Brotherhood, I noticed that Caterina shows up in Brotherhood, and if people are just watching the movies, it might be confusing.

1354972639.0,180,self.assassinscreed,14hvwd,"Following the Creed and How the ""Full Sync"" System Should Work (idea)",ScandLynx,201,21,74,http://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/14hvwd/following_the_creed_and_how_the_full_sync_system/,"Since AC:B, all missions in the games have had secondary objectives which gives you ""100% sync"" if you complete them. Sure, this system serves a purpose of making the game more replayable, but at the same time the system is flawed in many ways and need some changes. Here are the biggest flaws in my opinion:

* The objectives often take away from the game experience rather than adding to it and it discourage creativity. For example (AC:III spoiler) [spoiler](#s ""in the Bunker Hill battle, when the objective was kill your target with an air assassination, it destroyed the epic feel of the mission when you forced yourself to find a way up rather than being creative and come up with your own strategy""). Sure, you could always to it your way anyways, but then the game kind of slam in your face and say ""YOU DID IT WRONG!"" when the mission is over.

* The objectives are often random and doesn't make any sense. For example: ""kill the wolves without using ranged weapons"", ""Sink the ship by shooting the gun powder"" or ""don't touch water"". Those kind of objectives just feel pointless and annoying and doesn't really contribute to a better experience. 

* The secondary objectives often hint at what is going to come, and therefor make it expected. For example, if the secondary objective says ""kill your target from horseback"" then you can obviously expect horses to be around.

These three things could easily be fixed by two really simple fixes: Reveal the objectives after the mission is done and think through the objectives some more. Revealing the objectives after the mission may sound bad, but think about it: it would obviously increase the replay value because you would most likely not achieve the objectives on the first try unless you did so by accident, it wouldn't be spoiling anything or make the player expect anything, and it wouldn't discourage creativity for that first time.

The games have also lately been dumbed down looking at how little stealth is encouraged in the later titles. Looking at AC:I, you were almost certainly screwed if you didn't stealth while in AC:III brutal and open combat is encouraged while stealth is almost discouraged. I'm not saying that you can't stealth in AC:III, I'm just saying that it's almost not even rewarding to do so. On top of that, the games seem to care less and less about the actual creed of the assassins. In AC:I, the tenets of the creed is heavily enforced on the player, they become aware of the ways of the assassins and gets an understanding what the assassins are all about. In AC:III, the tenets are not even referenced to. I understand this is partially because the brotherhood has evolved, and while that is interesting, one of the reasons why I fell in love with the series is because the assassins really had an ideal and creed. They don't kill for no reason, they have a philosophy.

So in order to encourage creativity, stealth and the creed a little more I propose this system:

The player is first introduced to the idea of the assassins creed and the three tenets (stay your flesh from the blade of an innocent, hide in plane sight and never compromise the brotherhood). These tenets will be the guidance for the player as an assassin and to guide him or her towards a successful assassination. For all missions, the game keeps a record of how well you perform on these three tasks and will give you your result at the end of the mission, just like the sync system does. Unlike the sync system, you will not be given any information on how to best kill your target or how to get a better result, it's expected of you ass an assassin to know these tenets (the game will explain how you will achieve a better result, all missions play by those rules). The game will keep track of all you do instead of giving you secondary objectives, and therefor you must be creative to get a better result.

This is how the game would see how well you follow the tenets:

* ""Stay Your Blade from the Flesh of an Innocent""
This tenet discourage the killing of those who doesn't have to die. From what I understand, it's not just civilians, it's everyone aside from the target. In other words, the assassin should try to only kill the target. In other words, the player will score a higher result if they sneak past the guards rather than killing everyone. Not killing civilians is obviously a requirement.

* ""Hide in Plain Sight""
(from the wikia:)Be unseen. The Assassins' aim was to get close to their target stealthily, and escape just as quickly. In more ancient times, Assassins aimed to perform ostentatious, awe-inspiring assassinations, usually in public.
The greatest illusion from such an assassination was that the Assassin seemingly materialized from nowhere, killed a corrupt public figure, and vanished into the depths of the crowd or environment.

This part is easy to translate into this system: don't get caught. The less the guards see you, the better result you will reach. The quicker you escape after killing a target, the better result you will reach. Hiding in a crowd will be better than just killing your followers. Killing your target in more creative ways or in public will lead to a better result. 

* ""Never Compromise the Brotherhood""
The actions of one must never bring harm to all. If an Assassin failed in his or her duty, and was captured or chased, he or she must never commit any action or say anything that could be tied back to the Brotherhood, or bring harm to any member of it.

By just following this description, it may be difficult to translate into the system, but considering how (AC:I spoiler) [spoiler](#s ""Altaïr breaks that tenet by attempting to attack Robert after being discovered and therefor risk the lives of his fellow brothers""), I believe this could be translated into ""kill all those (guards) who have noticed you, do not let them tell their officers about you, because that will be a risk for the brotherhood. In other words, if a guard discovers you, kill him, and do not let him alarm others.

(Ubisoft could easily add other factors, but these where just examples)

Now, this system may seem pretty straight forward: kill the target stealthily = profit, but it isn't as straight as that. You will probably often have to face situations where you can risk getting caught but will achieve e.g. an air assassination, or you can go the path with less guards but a less ""good"" possibility for an assassination. Perhaps your weakness is to sneak past the guards and therefor kill them, but can make up for it by killing them stealthily and making a great assassination of your target. Another player may be the exact opposite. Perhaps you find a path that no other player have thought of, and will therefor get a greater result.

TL;DR: Make the full sync objectives hidden until you complete a mission, make a system that rewards the player for following the three tenets.

My favourite dying words were from Hickey, I was really surpirsed by his monologue orignally expecting him to be a simple man, but yet in death he told his wisdom to Connor and honestly made me think whether its smarter to pursue an impossible dream or settle for what you can get.

I really would like to see Ubisoft make this as a new feature for multiplayer. Each player can have their own ship and give it a fitting name as well. They could make a free-for-all game mode where the ship with the most kills is the winner and they could also make a team-deathmatch style game mode where the team with the most kills is the winner. Maybe a ""Territory"" game mode could be made where a team has to capture a territory and hold it for points. A ""VIP"" game mode could also be made where one players ship becomes the VIP and your team has to defend their VIP while trying to kill the other teams VIP. There's so many more ideas that could be implemented into it.

The main game will be 15 – 20 hours, “but the goal is to have you get lost in the world, spending even more time in it!”

“Edward’s four flintlocks actually reload faster than Connor’s… It’s that way so you don’t have to wait around forever.”

“[Assassin's Creed] is about credibility and authenticity, not about simulation.”

Answering the question of who replaces Desmond, Ashraf said, “You will, you replace Desmond. Playing in first-person.

Black Flag will have some “Assassin tombs like in [Assassin's Creed 2].”

When asked if Haytham is in the game, Ashraf replied, “I don’t want to ruin any surprises, but Haytham is Edward’s son…”

“We’ve listened to our fans and brought back several elements from #AC2 and #ACB, like new hire groups like drunken pirates and we have new tools that will manipulate the crowd in fun ways.”

“You can stealth your way through about 85% of the game, but there are some forced battles, like boarding actions.”

Ashraf’s favorite part of making the game was “pushing seamless gameplay,” with his favorite assassin “biased towards Edward, but besides him, I’ll say Altaïr.”

“All of the sword takedowns will be unique (Hidden Blade too!).”

“Yes, we have third-person free aim.”

The most significant differences in Black Flag are “naval combat and exploration gameplay.”

The present day storyline picks up right after Assassin’s Creed III, “but now we’re inside Abstergo researching Edward Kenway because he does something important.”

“No double barrel pistols… maybe next time.  ”

When asked if we could crouch, or if it’s area based like foliage cover Ashraf said, “It is foliage cover, but when you come out of the foliage you can remain crouched.”

“There isn’t currently a plan to do a game with Ezio’s daughter.”

“There is no character customization in the present day, but you can have a bit of fun with your Animus workstation.”

“The world is bigger [than Assassin's Creed III] and there are tons of cohesive side activities and side missions… more than any previous AC. All of the side mission/activities have something that they give you, like a tangible in-game *thing*.”

“Within the first 4 hours of the game, all of the side missions will be unlocked and the entire Caribbean world will be open to you to explore after about one hour.”

“Yes, there will be optional objectives, but they’re more about gameplay variation than difficulty.”

Plantations reset do reset so you can raid them again and “forts have side missions connected to them and become friendly, so they attack your enemies!”

“We have new factions that should be familiar to AC fans, with slight twists in their gameplay.”

“Edward’s tattoos are not customizable.”

But I actually found him to be one of the best characters in the series. 

Throughout the game he fights for what he believes in, and even when literally *everyone* tells him he should give up, he sticks to his guns. Yes, they were probably right, he was fighting a losing battle from the start. But he didn't give up, and he stopped at nothing to do what he thought was the right thing.

[spoiler](#s ""He didn't save the world, he didn't even save his people's land. He ultimately failed in what he set out to do."") But still, he made a difference, for better or for worse. AC3 portrayed the Templars in a more realistic light, and gave them a real chance to get across that they aren't evil. Maybe they are, maybe they aren't. Either way, had Connor let them go through with their plans, the outcome would have been worse.

&gt;Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag follows British Assassin, Edward Kenway, as he fights to save the future of the Assassin Order. Templar forces are strengthening in the shadows of The Caribbean Islands, preparing to launch an unrelenting attack on the British Empire. Players will fight with everything Edward has to offer and will experience his life as a privateer and would-be pirate, all while exploring brand new environments, meeting exciting new characters and old characters, and stories. Sail the seas surrounding The Caribbean Islands as the Assassin Order loses it’s grasp of controlling the ongoing war, between themselves and the Templars. Discover all new gameplay mechanics, alone or with friends, and become an expert sailor as you shape Edward’s maritime future.

Here is what I make of it so far:

When I finally reached the king and had to fight all those guys in the circle, it was even harder. I had to run around, doging their strikes, and attacking them while they were staggered. After some hours and a lot of restarting, I finally made it.

This may sound stupid, but my biggest fear for the movie (aside from a few unrealistic aspects like climbing and the leap of faith) is the hood.

In all fan photos of hoods no matter how great they look, they seem either lacking in style, ridiculously large, or ugly. I have yet to see a decent looking hood even from the ubiworkshop. Even in Assassin's Creed Lineage, the hood didn't quite look too great, although this movie will be much better quality.

As you can see I *finally* got some time to update the theme for AC3. Please let me know if there are any problems or glitches with it via mod message, and I'll get it fixed.

Now, I have a question for your guys regarding content on this subreddit. I feel that settings rules while the population is still relatively small allows for you guys to set this subreddit up the way **YOU** want to, and will help enforce rules as our numbers increase.

Personal opinion outside of my mod role, I would like to utilize a guideline similar to /r/hockey where memes as posts are removed, but are more than allowed in the comments. I'd also like to implement the ""Content must have AC in the post, not just the image"" so it limits the # of ""My face when"" and such posts.

In the end though, this is our home for Assassin's Creed, and it's going to be what you guys want it to be, so make sure to make your voice heard.

Which got me wondering: just how far can I take this?

It turns out that you can take it pretty far.

If you're using trip mines to target civilians, it seems that at most you can take out two without being desynced- 3 or more will inevitably end your spree.

If there are guards caught in the blast, however, it seems that all bets are off.  As long as the mine kills at least one guard, it seems you can harvest with impunity.

So far, the most effective method I've discovered is this:

* Start riot near guards (preferably just one or two)

* Watch guards and rioters clash

* Throw money at guards, civilians bum rush them

* Plant mine at guards' feet

* Sweet, sweet mayhem

The game is to see how many civilian bodies you can have on screen at once without desyncronizing.  So far, my best is 35.

But! all of these should be optional.  You could run in guns/ swords blazing and wipe out the hordes of guards connor-style OR... poison the lunch heading for guards before slipping in back and slipping into your targets room or another of the X number of ingenious different ways etc...

I know that the ending isn't popular among many people. Either because Desmond ""died"" hastily and there wasn't enough, or just the fact that he died.

But, here are my thoughts.

Prior to the release of ACIII, I went into my annual AC craze and decided to freshen up on things. In doing so, I went to the Assassin's Creed Wiki, and read the Assassins page. Under history, and I don't know how many of you know of this, but I read of ""The Ankh,"" or a Piece of Eden capable of Resurrection.

http://assassinscreed.wikia.com/wiki/Assassins

Now, you probably know where I'm going with this. William, Rebecca, and Shaun find that Desmond is dead, and rush to find The Ankh. Either they find someone who has ancestors that were Assassins during the Roman Empire, and dig through their memories in order to find the shrine where The Ankh is located, or that William, Rebecca, or Shaun have a lineage that descends from the Roman Empire Era. They find The Ankh, and revive Desmond.

Historical portion of the game = Roman Empire Assassins

Present day = Hunt for The Ankh and Resurrection of Desmond

1368561455.0,142,self.assassinscreed,1ec2sb,"To all the people who say they want to go back to AC1’s stealthy-assassin roots, I would like this to be a definitive rant on why you are wrong and you should please stop now.",Spelcheque,277,135,101,http://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1ec2sb/to_all_the_people_who_say_they_want_to_go_back_to/,"1) AC1’s stealth mechanics were actually some of the weakest in the series. They were great for the time, but II added the ability to blend with any crowd, to hire courtesans to hide you and distract the guards and then poison your target and slip into a dark alley before anybody was suspicious. Brotherhood added poison darts and crossbows for silent kills from a distance and when you blended with a moving crowd you could stick with it and let go of the controller. Every game in the series improves on the mechanics of its predecessor. III actually had fantastic stealth mechanics, but apparently a lot of you didn’t bother to use them. Creeping through bushes, peeking around corners, mobile eavesdrops, kicking back with a beer to blend in. They were much more interesting than praying wherever you went.

2) AC1 was not a stealth game. From the very beginning they decided to focus on three mechanics: stealth, combat and free-running/climbing. It’s impossible to get through any of the games without engaging in quite a lot of all three. There are a couple things about the first game that would lead you to believe otherwise though. The marketing, for one, and a lot of the in-game dialogue. The difference between that and the game we actually played is called [ludonarrative dissonance.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludonarrative) If you think AC1 is a stealth game because you “work in the shadows to serve the light,” then you suffer from this.

3) Assassin is not synonymous with stealth. Via [Mirriam-Webster:](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/assassin) “1: a member of a Shia Muslim sect who at the time of the Crusades was sent out on a suicidal mission to murder prominent enemies. 2: a person who commits murder; especially : one who murders a politically important person either for hire or from fanatical motives” As for the first definition, it would’ve gotten boring if every game had been in the Holy Land. The second definition applies to Altair, Ezio and Connor equally. There is of course a third definition, the game-world’s secret society dedicated to promoting the freedom of the common man, often through violence. That also applies to all three protagonists. The idea of an assassin as someone who sneaks around stabbing people comes, as far as I can tell, from Dungeons and Dragons. Grow the fuck up.

4) The games are based on history. [These are assassins from history.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_assassins) Note how few of them were full-time sneaky stabbers. They were men of their times who at some point decided to change history through murder. A successful assassin isn’t necessarily the one who’s good at hiding in shadows. Sometimes it’s the one who works his way up the social ladder through business, politics or military service. A good assassin adapts to his surroundings however he can.

I’m not completely close-minded. If you think I’m wrong you can try to convince me, but I’m 95% sure that I’ve read whatever you have to say before and I really don’t think I’m wrong here.

One reason I would very much like for you to stop is because Ubisoft, in my opinion, is doing this right. They don’t need all this fan pressure to make less interesting games than they’re making.

If you want to play a stealth game, a quick Google search found me [this.](http://www.gamespot.com/unions/SCunion/forums/24037810/list-of-stealth-games) I dare anyone to find a comparable list of games that let you run around meticulously recreated historical locations as Batman without the strict moral code. That’s the game a lot of us here want. This is the only series that’s doing it. If you don’t like it you’ve got options, we don’t. So please, please, just shut the fuck up.

I probably won’t want to type this whole argument again, so if I just link to it as a reply to your comment then you might want to consider saying less ignorant things in the future.

Edit:  Some have said that there is no stealth in the main missions.  I would like to point out that The Surgeon, The Soldier, Infiltrating Southgate, Execution is Everything, The Braddock Expedition, Boston's Most Wanted, On Johnson's Trail, Hostile Negotiations, The Midnight Ride, Conflict Looms, Battle of Bunker Hill, Something on the Side, Bridewell Prison, Missing Supplies, Lee's Last Stand and Laid to Rest all feature stealth as either a requirement or an encouraged option.  

Edit 2:  People have been saying that making the combat easier diminishes the stealth in the game.  I strongly disagree.  Making combat harder wouldn't make the stealth better, it would just make the fights longer.  It's completely unrelated to how being a sneaky guy works.  They made a game that gives you lots of opportunities to be that guy.  If you chose not to take advantage of them because mass-murder is so easy then that was your choice, but complaining that there wasn't enough stealth when you actively chose not to use it is silly.  Imagine if I walked slowly through the entire game because it was easy and the guards didn't bother you then came here and complained that there wasn't enough free-running.

You've been kidnapped by a pharmaceutical company called Abstergo, which is run by some barmy old codger called Warren Vidic (who just so happens to be a complete smug prick who thinks his shit don't stink). Vidic tells you that Abstergo is a famous company that has developed pretty much every invention ever. As you play the game, you find out that Abstergo is a modern day front for the Knights Templar, a faction who strive for world peace by taking away free will (they're the bad guys). You also learn that they think you're a member of the Assassin Brotherhood (you used to be, but not anymore), a faction that have been rivalling the Templars for centuries to try and stop their shenanigans (*eeeevil* shenanigans).  
* the reason they kidnapped you, is to place you in a machine called the Animus (which is actually Latin for *soul*). What the Animus does is allow you to relive the memories of your ancestors by accessing the genetic memory stored inside your DNA. They want to do this because your ancestor, an assassin from the 12th century called Altair Ibn La-Ahad, came into possession of an artifact called The Apple, which is one of many Pieces Of Eden. So without so much as a how-do-you-do, they (Warren and his assistant Lucy Stillman), place you in the machine.  
* when the Animus starts up, you take over as Altair at Solomon's Temple, looking for the Apple, but arrive just in time to see Robert de Sable, the Templar Grandmaster, get to it first. Because he's such a massive douche who stole your prize, Altair tries to stab him in the face, but fails. Shit hits the fan, and your buddies get caught behind as you're forced to flee the collapsing temple.  
* you return to the Assassin's castle stronghold at Masyaf (real place, used to actually be the stronghold of the *Hashashin*, the people where the word 'assassin' comes from). Your buddy who was left behind, rocks up minus a functioning arm with the Apple, with a Templar force right behind him. You do some sneaky bastard stuff, and sneak around them and overpower them.  
* after they've fucked off, your boss, another barmy old codger named Al Mualim, thinks you dun goofed, so he demotes you by **stabbing you in the neck**. Okay... aaanyway, somehow you survive, and are told you're going to have to earn you way back up to the top rank.  
* you are the provided with names of people who require murdering because they're being complete and utter bastards. You ride to three different cities; Jerusalem, Damascus and Acre (the game's set in the Holy Land during the Crusades. 1191 to be exact), and have a particualr target at each one, whether it be a weapons dealer, a lord, a military commander, or just some fat cunt with a squeaky voice. You gather info on your targets, and assassinate them one by one over the duration of the game. Every kill restores a level of rank (also, each target is based on an actual historical figure that died in 1191). As you notch up a bodycount, you notice that each of them, in their dying moments, all make a confession (this happens with every main target in each game of the series): what they did, they did for the people to prepare for a New World Order. You start to question whether you're doing the right thing, and come to the conclusion that you are, because the NWO requires the sacrifice of free will, something heinous in the eyes of the Brotherhood. So you kill and kill some more, getting closer to that douchebag de Sable.  
* he discovers that de Sable has been planning something nefarious: to unite the Christian and Muslim armies together against the Assassins. Fuck. He chases down Robert and catches up to him in front of Richard the Lionheart (who is one *fat* motherfucker). Dick says a trial by combat should take place, with God deciding who is right. Altair wins, then tells Dick that God had nothing to do with it, he did it all himself (I wonder if he made a faces of atheism post about that. ""I heard people praise God when I smote that bastard Robert de Sable. I DIDN'T SPEND MY WHOLE LIFE TRAINING FOR AN INVISIBLE SKY WIZARD TO GET THE CREDIT""). He then tries to convince King Dick that ending the war would be beneficial to both parties (Dick says no). Before he's proper dead, de Sable tells Altair that Al Mualim is actually a Templar too. What. A. Cunt.  
* you go back to Masyaf to do your own version of Star Wars (Dirt Wars?) and confront bossman. He tells you The Apple can conjure illusions, and that all religious miracles are products of the artifact. Altair's all ""pfff, get da fuck outa here, you crazy fool"", then Al Pooalim shows him some magic tricks, creating clones of himself. You then have a throwdown, and win. You recover the Apple from his body, and it turns on, showing a globe of the world with locations marked all over the place.  
* with the memory complete, Desmond is pulled out of the Animus to find Vidic chucking a conniption fit because a small band of Assasins are trying to mount a rescue effort to save you. Lucy, who you'd been talking with every time you came out of the Animus, tells you she's an assassin working undercover, and she's going to help you soon. When she leaves, you experience something weird: Eagle Vision. Walking around, you see symbols all over the floor and walls that you can't see normally. It turns out the previous person to do this shit, 'Subject 16', was in the Animus for so long he ended up crazier than a shithouse rat, and opened his veins up and painted the walls with his blood to leave a bunch of cryptic clues behind.

I couldn't quite put my finger on it at first, but it didn't ""feel"" like AC1 through ACR.  Then I realised what was missing.

The core tenant of Assassin philosophy, the Assassin's Creed, is missing from the game.  *""Nothing is true, everything is permitted.""* is not, as far as I remember, spoken a single time in the game.  That the Assassin's Creed itself is missing from AC3 is not, in itself, a deal-breaker, but it is indicative of the core difference: philosophy.

AC1 through ACR all dealt with, in some form, how a character's understanding of the Creed shapes their actions and decisions.  These games had players come to terms with what the Creed means in terms of freedom, and what obligations come with that realisation.  For an action videogame, that was some *deep shit*.

AC3, despite the background of the American Revolution, barely deals with the intellectual and philosophical ramifications of freedom.  Even though the historical context is one of people violently defending their freedom against benevolent-but-imposed order (which is what the Assassins are supposed to be all about), Connor himself is absolutely not interested in participating in that cause and he makes that abundantly clear very often.

Connor's motivation is not the Creed or some sense of moral obligation towards individual liberty, and unlike AC1 through ACR, it *never becomes that either*.  The only possible inclination that he got that realisation was cut from the game.

TL;DR - Unlike the rest of the series, AC3 was not, philosophically, a story about the implications of freedom.

That being said, AC3 is still an awesome game and story that I truly enjoyed.",,False,,t5_2s6v6,False,,,True,t3_169r8b,http://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/169r8b/what_makes_ac3_feel_so_different_to_me_at_least/,

This is what I think each of the assassins do in terms of combat.

Altair:
Stealth. When I say stealth, I mean both social stealth and regular stealth, and he tends to rely on stealth on his missions. He packs light in terms of equipment, which realistically would be ideal for stealth. I believe this is due to his background of being born into the creed, being taught at a young age to use stealth.

Ezio:
Open combat. Although he uses stealth, he tends to be in more open combat situations, and with his flashy personality, open combat would be more suitable for him. He is also more well equipped for open combat, with his armor and his large variety of equipment. His flashy personality is the biggest factor in fighting style, not his background (Italian noble thrown into the creed due to an event), if it were to affect his fighting style, it would make him more aggressive, but that is later resolved.

Connor:
Guerrilla. The basis of this style is using your environment, your skill, and the element of surprise to take down enemies with superior firepower and numbers. Connor's fast moving kills and various techniques fits this. The equipment he has aids him in doing so (smoke bombs and various traps). His background as a native American affects his fighting style because this was a common fighting style for native Americans to use.

I feel like he was learning from Connor. Connor's initial decision was to fight for his people, and he chose those who embodied his ideals in order to keep his people safe. Connor sided with the wrong side, because the patriots didn't keep their promises, and he lost his people. Connor chose what the principle over the result, and it cost him nearly everything.

Desmond too, is fighting for his people (humans, in this case), and he doesn't need a moral victory. He needs results, and the best chance is by letting everyone live and fight against the tyranny. He could have chosen to make a stand on principle, but that wouldn't stop the death of all the people he knows he can save. He chose the small chance for all humans to be saved rather than the high chance that very few humans would survive. I feel like he made the right choice.

I don't like the ending too much (I really liked the Desmond missions, and wanted him to live), but I thought that the ""twist"" was him understanding that the lives of his people are more important than the semantics of assassin vs templar.

My girlfriend has made a few hoodies for me and my friends and is currently making a new one for me to update her design. She would like to know if any of you would be interested in having one made and if so what exactly you would be interested in. She currently has white and black material for the outside shell and red for the inside. She is putting a beak on the hood but could leave it off. She is also unsure of what to charge when she finalizes a design. Would these options be enough? Would you want something else?


She has offered to make the first 5 or so at cost plus shipping so she can fine tune the design (I think it is quite perfect as is but she is a perfectionist) and in light of AC:IV coming soon I figured I would see if any of you would be interested in being guinea pigs or in setting up some kind of order as well. 


Any input is welcome as well as all constructive criticism.


Here are some pics of the last one she made for a friend of mine and once she finishes with my new black one I can post pics. All hoodies have been made to fit the wearer. 


http://imgur.com/a/RvOlB


**::UPDATE::**


Ok I wasn't expecting this kind of response so soon. She thinks she currently has enough fabric stock to make 1 black and 3 whites. She will have to order more fabric if you guys like the finished product so she can actually start doing this for people. She estimates her cost to be 50 plus shipping and once she starts going she thinks her final product might be worth 75 plus shipping. We are in the US and can ship however you would like. 


If you guys are still interested hit me with a PM and I will take first come first serve. Send me color, size, beak preference, tweaks (If possible), and any other stuff. 


She is very excited about the response this got and loves you all even if you don't want to buy!


**::UPDATE::**


Black was taken. Sorry that went so quick but she will be able to order more fabric if demanded.


**::UPDATE::**


I am sorry to say she may be out of fabric. I will still be capable of taking any requests for back orders but I think our first batch may be through. She is super excited that you all have taken an interest and I thank you for the kind words. If I get her to set up an etsy or something I will make sure to post that as well!


**::UPDATE::** (I got some formatting!)


OK so I have been bypassed because she wants to be able to get you all a hoodie! I hate you all ;)


So, I have been trying to respond to everybody in a timely manner but I am just a college student so bare with me. Finals week is coming and after that I should be able to set up a better system for her to field all of this so we don't have to use reddit. It is nigh impossible to really distinguish who I have discussed what with on here and/or through email.


She started the first black hoodie today and is going to have to make the pattern for it cause she didnt have one for a smaller size (I'm kind of a monster) but once she does she will be able to have a better understanding of how quickly she can pop these out and we might be able to start taking regular orders. I will post pictures of the black one AS SOON as she gets it finished. She didn't think black would be such a hit but it seems black is the new black. I will keep you posted as things roll in!

Feel free to add your own.

   Do the homestead missions. They make your crafting better, and are how you get the best sword in the game as well as upgrades for your character. You can also get saddlebags for your horse which can replenish most of your consumables.

   Get the assassin recruits. They are a LOT more useful than they were in previous games. They can escort you as their fake prisoner or just run around with you in a badass assassin pack until you get into trouble.

   If you're trying to do the boston brawler missions, I have two tips. The first involves the level 3 requirement that involves killing 10 jagers with their own weapons. If you go into the wilderness and reach level 3 notoriety (which you're not supposed to be able to do) jagers start spawning everywhere. It's surreal. I'm not sure what exactly triggers level 3, but I can usually reach it by going to a fort I already took and just slaughtering people wholesale.

The second tip involves the ""go beat people up"" missions. The brewery doesn't appear on the map. [This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG0IqI0FwAI) video shows you where it is.

   If you're trying to do the frontier hunting missions and can't find a hunting cabin, start at the your village and take the western path. You'll go uphill for awhile and eventually come to a fork in the road. Go left. Shortly (almost immediately) after that you'll see a hill to your left with a cabin at the bottom. This starts the missions.

   I'm having trouble finding George Washington to have conversations with him. Does anybody know where he is? I've beaten the game already.

   I bought the map to all the chests, but central boston says I'm still missing one chest. Has anybody had the same problem?

And finally, the club weapons. Holy shit do they rock.",,False,,t5_2s6v6,False,,,True,t3_12o3k9,http://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/12o3k9/assassins_creed_3_tips_and_glitches_no_spoilers/,

&gt;“This was not my decision. Ubisoft’s actions are baseless and without merit. I intend to fight Ubisoft vigorously for my rights, for my team and for my game. ”

Since there are 4 main games so far, some of which some players haven't beaten yet, a simple spoiler tag won't suffice anymore, as people won't know if it's a spoiler from AC:B or ACIII (context will make it obvious in most cases, but not all). So if someone like me, who's beaten all games and reveals all tagged spoilers without hesitation, reacts on instinct and uncovers a tag for an ACIII spoiler, they'll be upset. To combat this, **please add in brackets after the tag which game the spoiler is from**.  For example, [Ezio develops a friendship with Leonardo da Vinci](/spoiler)(ACII). 

I'm looking into being able to have customisable spoiler tags, which will have the game's name integrated into the tag, but I'm not sure how long this will take. 

As usual, self post, no karma, please upvote for visibility. 

EDIT: just in case you're unaware of how to do this for whatever reason, it's like this:

[Ezio's name is Ezio]\(/spoiler)(AC#) shows up as [Ezio's name is Ezio](/spoiler)(AC#)

If you've played GTA IV, you might know where I'm about to go with this.

Imagine, an entire open world (like Liberty City) where you and a friend (or maybe 3 friends, so it's a 4 person co-op) could either just dick around the city or have ""missions""

Like any open world co-op game, everyone would have to accept the missions. They give you targets that all of you would have to kill (like in Wolfpack)

So the co-op would be similar to Wolfpack mode (ACIII), but open and adventurous like GTA IV.

Being a fan of Assassin's Creed AND Co-op games, I'd love this.

After I beat the AC games, I do the remaining side missions and then get bored.

I know there's multiplayer, but most of the time I don't want to play that.

I always sit there playing ACIII, screwing around in the Frontier or NY thinking, ""This would be better if I had friends in here too""

1355476370.0,121,self.assassinscreed,14u3sm,[Spoiler] The State of the Assassin's Creed Series.,Pontius_Maximus,167,46,155,http://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/14u3sm/spoiler_the_state_of_the_assassins_creed_series/,"I just completed Assassin's Creed 3, and I have to say, I'm a bit disappointed. WARNING: Huge wall of text. Sorry.

Now before all of you start chasing after me with pitchforks, I have to say that this series has been very near and dear to my heart, right up there with the best of them like the Legend of Zelda. I have played every Assassin's Creed diligently, and enjoyed all of them, even the first one, which is widely regarded as not very good.

In the first Assassin's Creed, we're introduced to Altair. We have no idea of the existence of Desmond at this point. We go through his life, seeing how he is stripped of all his privileges, and then having to regain them back, along with a new sense of identity, culminating with the reveal of Desmond in the real world, and then at the end the betrayal of his mentor, the introduction of the Apple, and the fact that Desmond can use Eagle Vision. We build a relationship with Altair, progressing with him throughout the series.

Then the revolutionary Assassin's Creed II comes out. This game blew me away. It was leaps and bounds better than the first. But what really captured the player was the relationship that was built with Ezio. We literally started out as a child, moving each limb, then progressed as a young man. Climbing atop the church with your brother and the music playing, the panning out of the camera, and the Assassin's Creed logo, I knew it was the start of something great. And it most certainly was. Every relationship you built in the game mattered. You as the player were connected with each and every character, mostly Ezio. You wanted to overcome the Templar plot, find out exactly what they were up to. You learned as Desmond and Ezio learned. The puzzles that were added were ingenious, uncovering the truth about the past piece by piece, trying to figure out what it all meant. You wanted to do the side missions; they were meaningful and helped uncover the conspiracy you were trying to figure out not only as Ezio, but as the player. Then once you did all that, your mind was blown yet again with the story of those who came before, and what was really going on and what the Assassin's were fighting for.

The same goes for Brother and Revelations. We are now master assassin's. We can control and train new assassin's. We are spreading the cause, furthering the fight against the Templars, all the while uncovering new and startling facts about those who came before, and our part within it. Still, each relationship built felt so meaningful, that you just WANTED to progress. You needed to know what was going to happen next.

Enter Assassin's Creed 3. I can't say the same about this series. The whole process felt very streamlined, as if to appeal to more of a casual audience. The combat was magnificent, as well as the parkour elements, but I felt no connection to any of the characters, nor Connor at all. Ezio wanted to further the Assassin cause, overcome the Templars. Connor felt like he was blindly marching in and just wanted to save his people. Understandable, but still, unrelatable as a whole with the rest of the series. I didn't feel like an Assassin; I felt like an angsty boy who wanted vengeance. He seemed just like a conduit to find the amulet, and even then, that whole process was streamlined as well. Everything felt rushed. Is this to show the desperation the crew feels as the world is about to end? Perhaps. But it could have been done much better.

It seems like Ubisoft got lazy with this game, I hate to say. They took out all the aspects of the old Assassin's Creed games that were amazing (parkour obstacle courses, special armors, special weapons, basically things you had to work for to feel more like an awesome assassin), and streamlined the entire process. Where's the relationships? Why did I not really care that George Washington betrayed me? Shouldn't I have felt more conflicted when I killed my father? Why didn't I feel any satisfaction after finally killing Charles Lee? Why wasn't I shocked and awed when I found out that Juno wanted to betray us? Because it was all just thrown at me. There was no substance behind it. No involvement. 

This series has been an amazing journey. I don't want to see it fall like other game series have. I want to see it go back to its roots, and become greater than it was. I want to feel like an Assassin again.

Edit: This discussion got a little bit of attention, and I saw a trending theme among some of the contents. This was my critique of how I feel the series has ended up with the arrival of Assassins Creed 3. It was not my intention to come to this sure edit and say, ""blah blah blah this series sucks now here's why!"" I simply meant to state what I fear is happening, and don't want to see, because I am still a huge fan of the series. There are many things to love about the game, and I appreciate them all. Also, I will be returning to the game to do those side missions I missed in my first playthrough. Perhaps I will find more depth to the story, and the relatability to Connor and a connection with the characters that I crave through there.

Forgive me if this was already obvious to everyone else, but just in case, I felt I should share. What I realized was that what Minerva and Juno offered Desmond symbolized the fight between the Assassins and the Templars. Minerva's ending, in which Desmond allows the world to be destroyed only to start it over with him at the helm, symbolizes the Templars. This is because the Templars main idea was control of the masses by a selected few; if Desmond had chosen this option, he would have become a deity (as Minerva said) and therefore been worshipped, making him the one truly in control of the people. The Assassins main idea was peace through freedom, which relies on absolute trust in the people to conduct the world. In short, the Assassins trust the power of the individual, while the Templars consider the individual unpredictable and dangerous. By choosing Juno's ending, Desmond chooses the way of the Assassins, which is the final step in him accepting his past and his destiny as an Assassin.

1353551390.0,116,self.assassinscreed,13lmor,"AC3, a theory on the first target [Spoiler, Sequence 11]",ShouldersofGiants100,132,16,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/13lmor/ac3_a_theory_on_the_first_target_spoiler_sequence/,"Okay, if you haven't finished the game and care at all about the plot, stop reading, you have been warned. Being an insufferable nerd when it comes to lore, After beating the game, I looked at the [Assassins Creed Wiki article on Haytham Kenway](http://assassinscreed.wikia.com/wiki/Haytham_Kenway) and found a detail I hadn't noticed before. In his backstory, Haytham was raised and unknowingly trained, much like Ezio, by his assassin father. At some point in his youth, he met the head of the Templar order and abandoned the Assassins. What is not made clear however, is the fate of his father. This made me think of the first target we see Haythem sent to eliminate. The target is an old man, who we know only a few things about.
1. He is either an assassin (given his age, he is likely a high ranking one, possibly even a Mentor) or closely affiliated with the order (The former is more likely, given the way the assassins pursue Haytham's ship on the way to America and the fact he is forced to kill the man rather than simply steal the key, a legitimate option with a non-assassin)
2. He personally knows Haytham
3. Haytham says he is sorry before killing the man and the man says sorry back, but does not attempt to resist
4. The man says that had Haytham come to him, they could have found another way
I think the evidence from this leads to only one conclusion, the man Haytham kills in the booth is his own father.

First consider the apparent age of the man, he could quite easily be old enough to be Haytham's father. We know his father was an assassin based on the information on the wiki and we know that Haytham abandoned him in favour of the Templars, which fits the man in the booth relatively well. Second, look more carefully at the actual dialogue in the scene (http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=h98nNWeLycM#t=791s). The man seems surprised that Haytham is there, but the way in which he greets him is not with the same derision we have seen when assassins meet templars unexpectedly in the other games. He then says that they could have found another way, had Haytham come to him. William Miles mentions in a dialogue that there have been moments where assassins and templars have tried to reconcile, this could be the aftermath of one of them. Haytham has moved on, but his father refuses to accept it and yearns to reconcile, which is why he makes no move against Haytham, he either cannot bring himself to or he does not think Haytham will actually kill him. This explanation also better explains the apologies that follow. Haytham might apologise to a respected adversary, but the target says that he is sorry to. While ""I'm also sorry you are going to kill me"" is a possible interpretation, it doesn't make much sense in the context. What makes far more sense is filling in the blanks like this:

Haytham: For what it's worth, I'm sorry it came to this father, but you just wouldn't listen
Target: As am I

From that perspective, the apologizing to the target begins to make sense. There is one other piece of circumstantial evidence to be found in the scene, occurring earlier when Haytham has to locate the box the target is in. He is asked by his contact (Reginald ) if he has seen the play before and he responds that his father took him to see it as a child, but he remembered little of it. While saying it, he seems almost nostalgic. It is also revealed that this is a revival of the play. The scenario is almost poetic. An irreconcilably distant father and son both attend a performance of a play that could well be their last real memory together. Haytham was converted to the templars rather young, it doesn't seem a stretch that his father taking him to the play could have occurred shortly before his perspective changed, creating a distance between the two and ensuring no more close memories. 

While this doesn't change much in the overall perspective, it does give additional depth to Haytham's character and creates an interesting symmetry; wherein Haytham is killed by his own son who had also opted for the alternate cause and had also seriously considered reconciliation between the Templars and Assassins through the father/son bond.",,False,,t5_2s6v6,False,,,True,t3_13lmor,http://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/13lmor/ac3_a_theory_on_the_first_target_spoiler_sequence/,

As it turns, she was a lying whore working for the Templars. Although, in reality it was just Ubisoft not wanting to give Kristen Bell more money, which sucks, because Lucy had a very pretty bum). Shaun and the other assassins have placed him in a special area of the Animus to allow him to recover. Here he meets the AI recreation of Subject 16, the guy who went batshit crazy and gave your bedroom a new paintjob. He starts rambling on about pseudo-science stuff, pretty much telling you you have to keep reliving Ezio's memories (which is Ubisoft's way of saying ""give us more money!""). In we go...  
* first thing you see is a cutscene of Ezio travelling to Masyaf to learn more about Altair. It's one of the best cutscenes I've ever seen. There's a fucking epic battle, all done out in *gorgeous* CGI, before Ezio is captured by bad guys. They try and hang him, but considering he's Ezio Fucking Auditore, he escapes and chases the bad guys down.  
* you find yourself at the door to Altair's Library, but learn that you need 5 special keys to open the door, and the Templars have the first and the way to find the others. You chase down the (really, really ugly) guy with the book, and stab him in the chest. You call him a bastard, take the book, and it's off to Constantinople!  
* considering Ezio is now Il Mentore of the Assassin Brotherhood (*the* boss), the local leader, Yusuf, meets up with you, gives the lowdown on what's happening in Constantinople (the Byzantines are pissed off with the Ottomans for beating them up and taking over the city), and then gives you your brand new Hookblade. You run around and 'learn' how to use it (read: have fucktons of fun with your new toy), then you get down to business.  
* the story actually has several main paths, so I'll explain them seperately to avoid confusion.  
* **STORY ONE**    
   Upon arriving in Constantinople, you search for Niccolo Polo's Trading Post, as he wrote the book you have. There, you learn it's now a bookshop run by the awesome-boobed Sofia Sartor. She helps you decipher messages in rare books that you find, and each time, you are able to locate a key. Over the game, you can see a blossoming romance developing.   
* **STORY TWO**   
   another person you meet claims to be a young student at first, but is later revealed to be the grandson of the current Sultan, and future leader Suleiman the Great (he's not great yet though). He tells you his old man (Selim) and uncle (Ahmet) are both vying for the Sultanship (is that a real word? Fuck it, it's staying), with daddy being a better choice. Sully tells you that he thinks Tarik, the captain of the guard, is working with Templars to control who takes the Sultanate (that one *is* a real word). He asks you to investigate.  
* you find out Tarik has been helping some fat cunt called Manuel bring in weapons to supply an army to overthrow the Turks and bring back the Byzantines. With Sully's request, you stab Tarik in the head, at which point he tells you he was being a sneaky fuck to find out Manuel's plans, and he's holed up in some underground city. Off you go...  
* you sail to Cappadocia after destroying the Great Chain, which is a fucking awesome mission. You go underground to the city, do some Ezio stuff, blow shit up, and murder the fat fuck. At this point, you learn that Ahmet is a Templar, and he's got your girlfriend!!!    
* **STORY CONVERGENCE**  
   you get back to Constantinople, and arrange a swap: the keys for Sofia. Ahmet, being a total and complete wanker, fucks you over, but you're able to save Sofia's ~~boobs~~ life. You give chase to get the keys back. You catch up, youse both fall over the cliff, and you *beat him up in mid-air* (seriously, it's fucking awesome). Selim shows up after being recently Sultanified, kills Ahmet, and tells you to eat a bag of dicks for no good reason.  
* Ezio and Sofia both travel to Masyaf to finally open Altair's Library. 

--- 

* **THE KEYS**  
   each time you find a key, Ezio is able to relive one of Altair's memories. When he made them with the power of The Apple, he implanted memories on them. There are 5:  
   * 2 years before the events of AC1, Altair arrives at Masyaf to see the Templars being bastards. He kills them until they run away.  
   * right after killing Al Mualim at the end of AC1, Altair burns his body to make sure he's proper dead, and Abbas, some douche who hates your guts, steals the Apple and tries to show everybody why he's tougher than Altair. Altair saves him after he almost dies. Dumbarse.   
   * Altair and his wife Maria have returned after 10 years of telling Genghis Khan to stop being a bully, to find that Abbas has taken control of the Brotherhood, and has been telling fibs about Altair. He also had Altair's son executed. While confronting Abbas, one of his cronies taunted Altair about killing his son, so he tried to use the Apple to make him cut his own throat. For some stupid reason, Maria tries to stop you, and gets stabbed by the guy she's trying to save. You murder him to death, by way of *bladus meetus neckus*, then escape after everyone tries to kill you.  
   * after 20 years in exile, you return to Masyaf, to find that Abbas has turned it into a shithole. You convince the other assassins that he's a dropkick, and kill him with the hidden gun that was learnt through the Apple. Altair takes his place as Il Mentore.  
   * the fifth key shows Altair passing the keys onto Niccolo Polo, to take them to Constantinople.    
* **BACK TO EZIO**  
   after opening the door to the Library, he wonders around for a bit, before you see the skeletal remains of somebody sitting in a chair in the centre of the room. Upon inspection, you see that it's Altair. Ezio leans down to pay his respects, and see another key sitting in his lap. He takes it and activates it.  
   * the memory is of Altair standing at the door to library as a 92 year old man, saying goodbye to his other son Darim. He seals himself inside, and places the Apple behind a secret wall panel. He turns and stumbles a bit, then sits in the chair for ""a little rest"", then the camera shows Ezio kneeling in front of his remains.  
* **HERE'S WHERE IT GETS *REALLY* FUCKING EPIC**  
   Ezio decides to leave the Apple, but turns and starts talking out loud to Desmond, saying ""I don't know who you are, but I know you're watching"". He says he has lived a life of purpose, but was nothing more than a conduit for another, and that he hopes Desmond finds the answers he was looking for. He then holds his arms out to signify an embrace (you see an image of Desmond returning the courtesy. It's way cool).  
* then a cutscene of Jupiter, the final of the 3 TWCB gods starts talking to Desmond. He explains that back in his heyday, they constructed underground vaults to try and learn how to stop their destruction (guess how that turned out), and that there is one final vault that has the answer, and he shows him the location. The whole time he was talking another amazing cutscene of the annihilation plays out. Desmond wakes up from his coma to find he has been taken to America. His arm glows blue, he sees the Apple they'd taken from AC:B, and he says ""I know what we have to do"". Credits roll.

1369327088.0,115,self.assassinscreed,1ewtwz,"Why I disagree with all the AC III bashing(Spoilers AC III, obviously. I mean, don't read it if you haven't seen the ending).",animaculecracker,151,36,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1ewtwz/why_i_disagree_with_all_the_ac_iii/,"Since at had been awhile since I'd played through the Assassin's Creed series, I decided to go back and to it in preparation for the October release. For all its incredibly shameful bugginess, and Connor's being a mediocre character, I think Assassin's Creed III is probably my favorite game so far. Looking around the internet, I think many would consider that total blasphemy. This is why I disagree with most of the common critiques.

**""This installment doesn't fit in the series, and Connor is two selfishly motivated to be an assassin:""** I really just don't think its true when you consider the time period. The colonial America is much closer to the modern day story than any of the previous games. In the modern story, the Templars are at full strength while the Assassin's are a scattered few doing their work in secret and constantly having to pick up and move to escape total extinction. Well, how did that come to pass when in literally every game we've played the assassins kick the crap out of the templars at the end, and reform their order in full strength? I think characters like Connor explain it, more assassins who really don't put the order, or the greater good before their own selfish goals. It's not that Connor doesn't fit the mold of an assassin, it's that over time what it meant to be an assassin changed, which explains a lot about Desmond's world and situation, and the strength of Abstergo, which is a much more unified thing. Anyway lets face it, did any of us REALLY want to play yet another game with pretty much exactly the same storyline in a different time period? I think the developers probably knew that yea, Ezio and Altair had a great run but, after Brotherhood it was STARTING to get a bit tired. They needed a new angle and I think they found a good one.

**""The buildings weren't as tall as in the old games:""** Well, yea...they're in colonial America, they couldn't very well throw in skyscrapers and keep it believable. Anyway, the smaller buildings made escaping guards more challenging. 

**""Not enough cities:""** I really would have like to see more places as well, but the game is pretty damn huge, especially with the naval aspect. I think it would have been nice see Philadelphia and all, but I never felt like what they had was not enough. There is so ridiculously much to do in this game.

**""Slow pace:** I actually liked this. One of the problems I had with the old AC games is that I thought, even though you're living through these people's lives, there was always sort of a disconnect and you felt like you didn't know them as well as you should. I think the slow beginning remedied that in this installment. As much as Connor was not my favorite character we've had, I think he was one of the better developed. 

**""Desmond's death was not dramatic enough""**I don't think this was an accident at all. One of the major messages in the game is that no one individual really matters that much. I think most of the game was setting us up for Desmond's end to be kind of anticlimactic. That's pretty much what Charles Lee's whole speech was about at the funeral: That yea, Connor killed Haytham, but then Lee will just take his place, and Connor will kill Lee, and someone else will step up and get killed in an endless cycle etc... Desmond's death is not the end of the story (well obviously, since they're making another game), if it were too dramatic it wouldn't have fit with that message.

On that note, William Miles's reaction to Desmond's death I thought was fitting for who he is as a character. I feel like William is someone I just continue to have questions about and the ending really brought them all home. This last time I played the game I thought about it more than ever...there's one point on one of Desmond's missions, maybe the first powersource one, that Desmond gets ambushed and when asked something like how did the attacker know he was there, he says ""ask your father."" I don't think they ever really explain that. The Haytham/Connor relationship is also obviously suppose to mirror the William/Desmond relationship, which might be some kind of clue as well. 
Is it possible that William is somehow involved with Abstergo? It seems like Desmond's ultimate choice to help Juno over Minerva is ultimately the Templar answer, choosing death by order over death by chaos. It might be a reach, but what if Abstergo wanted Desmond and the gang to find the temple and release Juno, and William was there to make sure all went as planned? I don't know, it would be an interesting possibility, and would also explain why there was no touching father/son moment before Desmond died. It would also explain how Abstergo captured him apparently, but when he was tied up there was not a bruise on him as though there were no fight.

Yea, so that's why I didn't hate Assassin's Creed III. It's really good, guys. It's just really good.",,False,,t5_2s6v6,False,,,True,t3_1ewtwz,http://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1ewtwz/why_i_disagree_with_all_the_ac_iii/,

This movie turned out longer than I expected. I believe this game is actually the shortest Assassin's Creed game, but it's got a lot to its story. A lot more than I initially realized when playing it. Originally I felt like the game was filler since technically you can skip it and still completely understand what's going on in AC3, but after watching it in one sitting it's really got a great story that shouldn't be missed. 

I make these movies based on games for a few reasons. One is so that I can show these stories to people who don't play video games at all. This way they can enjoy the story without having to learn how to play. I also create these movies for people who may have been interested in the story, but didn't get the game for one reason or another. Then I also do these for fans like myself who may want to relive the story, but may not have the time or patience to play through the entire game again, to be able to relive the entire story in a single sitting is an experience rare to games. 

The way I do this is I focus on cutscenes primarily. The cutscenes are the primary drivers of the story, but if you only edit together the cutscenes, you're missing a lot, so to get the whole story you have to include some gameplay. However, because there is a big difference between video games and movies, I want to include as little of gameplay as I'm able to do without causing plot holes, and while keeping a good pacing/continuity. I also disable as many aspects of the game that show it off as a game, such as the hud, any button prompts, chapter titles, etc. It's not possible to remove all of these entirely, but I do my best.

I will continue doing these and will be doing Assassin's Creed 3 next, so make sure to subscribe to my youtube channel to be notified when that is released!

But I noticed that you can also counter, using the same mechanics, with the rope dart, trip wire, smoke bomb, poison darts, and even the animal snare.

The trip wire, smoke bomb, and poison darts are basically all the same. Connor grabs the person, attaches the selected item, and shoves them away. Personally I think the trip wire bomb is pretty cool.

The rope dart has a few counter actions that are pretty cool. But what really surprised me was the animal snare. Just attach it as your primary tool and counter with it, and you'll find that he dismantles the rope from the snare and strangles the man.

I mean, they're just doing their jobs.

* Patrolling the streets

* Patrolling the rooftops

* Making sure shit doesn't hit the fan

It's not like the guards walking around are Templars.

I mean, there ARE Templar guards like the Templar Knights in AC1 and the actual Templars in Cappadocia and sometimes in Konstantiniyye, but the normal guards aren't Templars.

As much as killing everyone is, and although it's only a video game, I sometimes find myself questioning myself.

I was playing ACII and heard a rooftop guard talking about wanting to get him money for the day and then go home to his family.
 
And then it struck me. These are just normal people doing good (unless they're harassing the civilians).

How would you feel if your job was to make sure people aren't on the rooftops and all of a sudden this assholes starts throwing knives at you **even after you told him to get down nicely?**

AC3 is its own game, with its own protagonist, who has his own personality, and has his own story. I'm sorry if this seems repetitive, but a large portion of the people in this subreddit expects multiple aspects of the AC3 game to be like the previous installments of the AC Series. 

I know that Ezio had a lovable personality, but this shouldn't mean that Ezio should serve as a character template for the future protagonists. Connor may have been cold and stern, but he had a justified cause for it. 

Also, I see that many are complaining about the Creed in AC3, whose grandeur had gone from many dedicated members to Connor, Achilles, and the other few recruits. I must remind everyone that the Creed's influence had diminished when we were introduced to Connor which was a realistic portrayal of change throughout the centuries. The customs and traditions of the Creed were long forgotten by the time of the Revolutionary War which disappointed many people, but I don't understand how many berate AC3 when this was also apparent during the Desmond parts of the game. 
 
The change had to come from somewhere, right?

As for the gameplay, a lot of people are overlooking the amazing job the devs did with AC3. Although it may not have the secret side missions such as the Lairs of Romulus, AC3 gave us the open frontier, the tree-climbing, hunting, crafting, differentiated side quests, and the underground tunnels. Some details may not have been as emphasized or admired as others, but it gave AC3 a new twist from what we were used to as well as gave the game its own flair and flavor.

Let's appreciate AC3 for what it is: An awesome video game of its own. Accompanied by an awesome story, AC3 is a game that permanently bid Ezio farewell and gave light to a new protagonist, whose character was all-too-unjustly placed in the shadow of the characters whom we missed. 

It's no doubt they are still missed, but we need to separate them all and acknowledge them for the unique individuals we know them as.  This also applies to their stories and the installments they were placed in. 


I'm sure you understand.

Edit to add link: http://kotaku.com/ubisoft-has-three-assassins-creeds-in-development-vow-513376223

&gt;Ubisoft is committed to making a new Assassin's Creed game every year and is determined not to see the series collapse from franchise fatigue. How?

&gt;""We are making sure the teams who are creating the different iterations have enough time—two years, three years, so that they can take risk and they can change the concept enough so that it can be appealing and fresh,"" Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot told me this week during E3.

&gt;He said Ubisoft currently has three Assassin's Creed games in development. He didn't say anything about them, but it's easy to make some safe guesses. Presumably the count of three refers to 1) this year's game, Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, 2) next year's game (Assassin's Creed V? Assassin's Creed Brotherhood II?), which should be well into development now and, 3) unless he was referring to a mobile spin-off or something, 2015's Assassin's Creed.

&gt;""Really, what we see is that we can have the capacity to regularly come with innovation,"" Guillemot told me. ""That is, for me, the formula: if you can really change the game on a regular basis and bring in innovation your fans want a product very regularly. Our job is to make sure the teams have enough power, enough energy and enough time to take the necessary steps to create a high quality game.""

&gt;Historically, these games have been made by multiple teams and by rotating teams, with different groups within Ubisoft Montreal leading the development of the games' campaigns, while satellite studios make everything from multiplayer to specific side missions.

&gt;Ubisoft is releasing Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag this year which does, in fact, appear to be quite different from last year's ACIII. Last year's game was a a game mostly set on land with a focus on a new, conflicted half-British/half-Native-American assassin. This year's is set largely across the islands of the Caribbean sea with a focus on a new assassin who still often behaves more like a pirate. Last year's game had some naval combat. This year's game is essentially an open-world sailing/exploration adventure.

1370418876.0,110,self.assassinscreed,1fpk0d,Story synopsis - Assassin's Creed 3,UnholyDemigod,137,27,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1fpk0d/story_synopsis_assassins_creed_3/,"Now, as you know, the last game ended with the gang in America at the location of the Grand Temple, with only days before the date of the Templars' grand plan. As there are two main story paths (in the animus and out of it), I'm going to tell them separate from each other to alleviate confusion. First up, the past... (with a small bit of the present to get it going)

* The group arrives at a cave. The Grand Temple, the final house of beings that are worshipped as gods, is a cave. They walk around, looking at all the cool stuff, and come to a hyoooge barrier made of some green light that they can't cross without some kind of key. With no idea of what to do next, Desmond decides it would be super-polite to get visions and pass out, so they throw him in the animus to fix him (and to, y'know, learn some handy shit)

**THE PAST**

* after the new animus program is synched, you become some pompous, yet totally mega-cool bozo called Haytham Kenway. You're in the 1700s, and you're at a play at some fancy opera house. You park your arse in a seat, get bored and decide to do some killin'. You use the most outstanding manners ever to move to the side, climb up and around and have a chat with some old geezer. Then you stab him and steal his necklace, some fancy green circle amulet

* you have a meeting with some other Assassins about moving to the New World (hereafter known as 'America') and finding the 'Precursor Site'. You get the go ahead, and jump on a boat (SHE'S A **SHIP** LAD!) 

* after a few weeks, the cap'n tells you America is on the horizon, and if you climb the crow’s nest you'll see it. You climb up to see your port of harbour: Bahston. You meet up with history's biggest brown nose, Charles Lee. He's a potential recruit into the Brotherhood, so he currently serves as your stooge. You meet up with your fellow assassins, those being Thomas Hickey, an alcoholic, William Johnson, a pompous git, John Pitcairn, and Benjamin Church, who you had to rescue from a foul-mouthed soldier with a fascination in taking people's cocks. Afterwards, you run around doing some cloak and dagger shit, kill some poms, and free some Indian slaves

* your next mission has you chasing down one of the Indian ladies that you freed, but because she thinks you're smelly, she runs away. After catching her, she tells you she needs your help. After being totally awesome gets you into a fight, you hunt down some fella called Braddock and kill him

* Ziio takes you to the Precursor Site (her tribe looks after it), but the amulet reveals nothing, so Haytham leaves sadly

* you meet up with all your buddies after you're done, and declare that Charles Lee is a pretty cool dude, and would make a good addition, so you formally initiate him into the Templar Order

 Wait

 What

 Wait

 [What. The. Fuck.]( http://replygif.net/i/744.gif)

 As is turns out, Haytham is *not* an Assassin. He's a Templar Grandmaster. I...I need a minute

* a cutscene shows Ziio explaining how Haytham knocked her up with Connor and then fucked off

* you finally get to experience the memories of Connor as a boy (he's got some weird indian name I don't know how to spell so I'll just call him Connor), and you go play hide and seek with your chums, only to get grabbed by none other than Charles Lee. Only now he's not some limey kiss-arse. He's a bad motherfucker. (Samuel L Jackson based the idea of his wallet on Chuck). He beats you up a bit, then lets you go, and you return to find your village burning, and watch as your mum dies

* after a nine year jump, Connor is now a young teen. You hang out with your friend (who also has a weird name so I'l just call him Fatty) and you finally get to tree-run, and it's fucken boss

* you go meet the tribe's witch-doctor, and she shows you that the tribe has an Apple, but this one looks like it's made of glass. You touch it, and Juno appears, telling you she's taking you to the Nexus, some magical place where you become an eagle and fly around while she tells you to look for the guy with the Assassin symbol

* you pack your bags and make your way to the homestead, where some grumpy old fart refuses to train you, so you threaten that you're never leaving, cos fuck him and fuck his privacy

* you see some bad guys trying to break in, so you kill them, and Achilles (the grumpy old fart) finally agrees to train you

* after your training, you go through the next several years of the American Revolution, meeting several colourful characters as you go. Some of them are:

 Benjamin Franklin, a fella who *adores* fuckin' old women

 Samual Adams, some famous beer-making dude

 Paul Revere, some fella famous for riding a horse in the dark or some shit

 ~~Palestine~~ Israel Putnam, a grouchy field commander

* when your training is finished, you go to town and get framed for the Boston Massacre, so you run away

* a few years later, Fatty shows up and tells you William Johnson is trying to buy your village, so to cut off his funding you dump the tea at the docks, severely horrifying poms everywhere. You find Bill John and kill him

* after a bit more running and riding, you have a battle at some place called Lexicon. Wait...no, that's not right. Anyway, after that, you see Georgie become El Presidente

* you track down and kill Pitcairn, who says he only wanted to parley, and by killing him you've inadvertently triggered a war, and exchange one of my favourite quotes ever:
 
 Pitcairn: ""you should have let me play my part""

 Connor: ""the part of the puppeteer""

 Pitcairn: ""better we hold the strings than another""

 Connor: ""no. The strings should be severed. **All** should be free""

* you go after Hickey next, and after chasing him down, you both get arrested and thrown in jail, only Charles Lee gets Hickey out and frames you for the attempted assassination of Washington, and has you sentenced to hang

* your fellow Assassins manage to save you from the noose just in time, and you manage to kill Hickey in the kerfuffle

* your next target is Church, and because he's betrayed the Templars as well, daddy suggests teaming up to get him. Youse track him down and murder him dead

* back at Washington's tent, Haytham finds out it was George who ordered the attack on your village when you were a boy, not Lee, and he's done it again. Connor tells the both of them to get fucked, and runs off to save his mates

* it turns out your village has allied with Lee, and Fatty thinks you're a sell-out and attacks you, forcing you to kill him

* you need to break into Fort George because Lee is hiding there, so you convince some frog poofter to bomb New York by helping him at Chesapeake Bay

* you manage to get inside, only to find out Chuck's not home (he probably ducked down to the pub for a pint), but daddy is. After a fight, he sits on top on you and starts to strangle you, and being a complete dumbarse, forgets what Assassins are famous for: their hidden blades. You stab him in the neck and he dies

* still wounded, you go to dad's funeral and find Lee, who now has the amulet, but are caught by his guards. Lee leaves you with them and you manage to escape

* you find Lee at the boatyard, and after an *annoying as fuck* chase, you catch up to him, but get trapped under falling debris. Just as Chuck's about to kill you, you pull out your gun and shoot him, but he manages to survive and get away. Again

* you follow him to a pub and watch one of the most powerful cutscenes ever:two men who hold absolute hatred for the other, yet both profess an unspoken mutual respect for their adversary. Horrifically injured, Lee knows he has no escape, and so offers Connor a drink. Connor accepts, and rather than taunting Lee or drawing out his death, ends his life quickly, taking the amulet

* after visiting his village and using the Apple to talk to Juno again, she tells him he needs to hide the amulet, so he buries it in Achilles' grave (oh yeah. He dead)

**THE PRESENT**

* Desmond is told the Temple runs on some kind of ancient power source, so they need find special types of batteries. The first is lying in the cave, but the next is in some office building, so you climb a skyscraper, jump off and land on another, meet Daniel Cross, beat him up and take the battery

* the next is at an MMA fight in Brazil, which requires you to beat up Danny again before you can get away. Shaun finds the next one quickly, but William says he'll go while you do the animus

* Dad gets captured by Abstergo, who offer a trade: him for the Apple. Desmond goes, kills Danny Cross, marches into Vidic's office, then uses the Apple to make one of his guards shoot him in his fat fucken face, which made me laugh. IT'S A WEAPON OF MASS DESTRUCTION YOU STUPID BASTARD

* you all go dig up Achilles, take the amulet and set to work installing the batteries, and each time, Juno appears to tell you about their attempts to stop their destruction, some being:

 * they tried to absorb the sun's rays, but it would have taken too long, so they automated the process while working on other stuff


 * they looked to the future to give a warning to us by talking to Ezio, Connor and Desmond

 * one fella volunteered for hibernation, but it made him retarded so they killed him

* with the place running at full power, you use the amulet to open the green door, and approach a pedestal. Minerva appears and tells Desmond not to touch it, because it will free Juno and she will conquer the world

* Desmond is made to choose between letting Juno free, or letting the world burn. If he takes the latter, he will survive and become among the surviors first a hero, then a prophet, then a god, and people will kill over his memory and misrepresented words (so basically, Religion 101). If he touches it, he will die. He touches it and dies, and a cutscene shows a news report of geological anomalies, but the world survives. Juno is released and says 'it's time to play my part"", and steps over Desmond's corpse as the credits roll.

Many people dislike this but I for one enjoy its symbolism. After the Credits we see him take down the paintings of his targets and throw them in a fire, then we see him pull the hatchet out the pillar in the front of the homestead, then he doesn't put on his hood anymore. I believe this is because he knows he is done. His quarrel is over and he has no reason to show he is an assassin anymore. By him not wearing his hood its a symbol that he knows that his story is finished.

A little more time, and they could perfect it. Here's why a pirate based AC game would work.

**Setting and Location:** 

The game would have to take place during the golden age of piracy in the Caribbean, from 1660-1730, so a little before the setting of AC3. Such a large area would need multiple cities and an 'open' area, like its predecessor. The Frontier would become the Caribbean Sea, and the three main cities could be Nassau Bahamas, Port Royal Jamaica, while the island of Tortuga could serve as your 'Monteriggioni'. 

* [Game Area](http://i.imgur.com/3lRQ8sP.jpg)

The British controlled Jamaica and the Bahamas, so British troops could be easily reused from AC3. 

Now for some concept art of the cities, to give a better idea of what the game could include. The architecture would be similar to that of the previous game, but embellished to provide the more 'European' feel we all loved in AC2/B. 

* Port Royal: [Docks](http://i.imgur.com/ow95ehxh.jpg), [Cathedral/Town Square](http://i4.minus.com/jbpM7tDr7mHvA.jpg), [Town Sketches](http://i1.minus.com/j8dCLBEmjav1s.jpg)
* Nassau: [Docks](http://i5.minus.com/jjDECtqZ5JYTd.jpg), [Town Streets](http://i5.minus.com/j74vDWBHJf1oG.jpg)
* Tortuga: [Docks](http://i2.minus.com/jeV0kjZhGB22s.jpg), [Jungle Wilderness](http://i1.minus.com/jbd6RlLSdtgil1.jpg)

Quest Areas: 

* [Lost temples on the coast of Belize/Mexico](http://img706.imageshack.us/img706/3180/pirati8.jpg)
* [A Shipwreck Cove type location from the PotC movies](http://images.wikia.com/pirates/images/2/2a/Shipwreck_Island.jpg) would provide some beautiful platforming.

This is all I have time for now, so feel free to comment about plot, characters etc.
More images on request.

Keep it real, Assassins

EDIT: No, this is not supposed to be a ripoff of the Pirates of the Caribbean movies. Port Royal, Nassau, and Tortuga are all real places that were thriving at the time of the golden age of piracy, which is why the movie series used them.

Another thing i liked about it is the Liberation missions. In acb and acr I felt like the recruits were just that: recruits but in AC3 they were people that I knew and wanted to be an assassin.

Desmond Miles. Subject 17. The ending wasnt satisfying but the missions in new york were fun to play and see Desmond back in action. 

Now onto the bad.
Yes it took forever to get the Assassin Outfit they should have at least made it one mission as his dad not like 6-8.
Yes there glitches but none that get in the way. 

Connor. He didnt have much feeling unless you noticed it he had smirks and sarcasm which made me feel like he was on a mission and he couldnt get distracted as much as he knew he could. He has see his mom dye before his eyes. And people want connor to have more emotion? That scarred him for life. He will not be able to have much happiness until he feels closure.

Overall 
I feel Assassins Crees 3 has a spot in the long line of the franchise.",,False,,t5_2s6v6,False,,,True,t3_157oaf,http://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/157oaf/what_made_ac3_actually_good_for_me/,

Some nice stuff here. From [@assassinscreed](https://twitter.com/assassinscreed).

* The cluster and glyph puzzles are returning in a way. There are hacking minigames that reveal secret Abstergo content. ""Become a modern day pirate!""

* While a lot of the modern-day content is optional, there are a ""handful"" of missions that you have to play, having a ""clear story arc.""

* Clay (Subject 16) won't be returning, but Desmond ""may... in a roundabout way.""

* The ""audio drama"" revealed at the Comic-Con panel tells the story of a few key Abstergo employees from 1980-1981.

* The present-day story takes place in Montreal, Quebec (heh). [Here's a view from the CCO's office.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BQmkC-vCQAAOb4Y.jpg:large)

* When asked ""Is our character aware the assassins and templars present existence? And do they learn much about Juno?,"" Darby responded ""Yes, we will slowly reveal the existence of Assassins, Templars, and...""

* Your character (*you*) are introduced to Abstergo by being hired to work there.

* No present-day combat: ""It's all about exploring, eavesdropping, and hacking. Modern day pirate stuff.""

* The world still looks the same after [spoiler](#s ""Juno was released from the Grand Temple. She is ""a rogue A.I. and does not have enough strength to overtake the world yet...YET."""")

* You have no relation with Desmond.

* When asked if we will see any familiar faces, Darby responds ""Maybe... do you see any familiar faces in this picture?"" [The pic](https://pic.twitter.com/JXazBGYC14)

* You can explore Abstergo. ""You'd be a fool not to"" as there's a lot of content to find. You get ""a taste if you just play the main story, and an entire buffet if you explore everywhere.""

* You can get out of the Animus at any time to the explore Abstergo Entertainment offices.

* You'll see what happened with Desmond.. ""might want to cover your ears though.""

* ""You work for Abstergo, but you may like Assassins better. Or neither.""

* When asked about making a choice between joining the Assassins or Templars, Darby responded ""Not a literal ""press X to choose sides"". It will just present two sides of a conflict.""

* Most people at Abstergo Entertainment aren't Templars.

* No dialogue options. Because you are the protagonist, they don't want to put words in your mouth.

* ""please tell me nothing awful is done to Desmond's body..."" ""I could say that, but it wouldn't make it true.""

* You can meet some of the people important to Abstergo Entertainment.

* Offices look like [this](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BQms_8qCUAATUG3.jpg:large).

I'm sorry if I don't get to you right away.

The press embargo JUST got dropped, so you should also be seeing a bunch of new information from the major gaming networks soon.

Last week I got to fly down to Boston to play Assassins Creed 3 along with Assassins Creed: Liberation with a bunch of other major community members and (what felt like) pretty much every video gaming journalist ever.

I got to play about three hours of Multiplayer AC3, Single Player AC3 and Liberation.

For multiplayer, I played Domination, Playground, Wolf Pack and Manhunt. I won't go into the multiplayer storyline, as I saw WAY to much of it (Everything in multiplayer was unlocked at the event, so I saw....a little too much...).

Platforms I played multiplayer on:

* Wolfpack and Manhunt on 360
* Domination and Playground on PS3

No WiiU's or PC's were at the event.

In single player I got to play sequence three. I won't go into storyline related details as I don't want to ruin it for you guys. However, gameplay related questions are cool.

I got to play a later sequence in Liberation (I think it was 5 or 6).  Again, I won't go into storyline related stuff, but gameplay stuff is fine.

I didn't get any gameplay footage. Why? Because IGN and G4 were there playing the same thing. I don't really think it would be too cool watching shitty iphone footage of the game.

Some pictures for proof. Again, sorry about the shitty quality. This was the whole reason why I didn't take too many.

There are no returning MP characters, however you can get their clothes. The courtesans dress is an unlockable for the Maverick and such. 


So, ask away!

I know there's an AMA but this is more of some things I enjoyed o far. I would probably say I am in the middle in terms of story.

The pros

Combat
It is much more fun this time around. Having played the other ones, I sometimes would lose interest fighting all the time. Ubisoft has managed to fix this. For example, there are so many different ways to go upon combat. Redcoats were walking a trail and I ran up ahead of them to put some bait on their trail. By the time they were close by, two bears were waiting to wipe them out. Combos are so much more smoother as well.

Hunting
I cannot describe how much fun they made this. Think Red Dead but more detailed. There are tracks you follow, and different methods to kill each one. For example, if I just take the easy route and shoot the deer from afar, I lose it's hide. However, if I stalk it and stab its neck, I reap the full benefits. They reward you with better loot if you kill animals a harder method. It is also easy to see which animals are in the location. Once you find the animal, your map will note that this certain animal roams the area. Ive maybe encountered nine different animals so far.

Naval
Probably the greatest part so far. You don't just command a ship.... You command a crew. The free roam aspect is great. You truely get the experience of a captain. You can upgrade your ship with better cannons, crew, and sails. It feels like a game itself with its level of detail. 

Story
It's important to note I never cared about the story. I never really paid attention to the previous ones and played it mostly for gameplay. This one is different. I have yet to skip a movie since I've become addicted to it. I understand almost everything that is going on but I'll probably have a better understanding if I read some summaries. This story, however, is probably the best of the year. The voice acting is perfect and you really become attached to your characters. 

Difficulty
It is harder this time around but your health regenerates. No more potions. So once you finish a battle, you have full health. You don't just worry about melee though since while in battle, others may fire their rifles. It's a good balance though. You can't just dodge everything anymore. You need to focus on combos to kill your enemies quickly.

Cons

Some minor bugs here and there. This usually caused me to miss an optional task for full synchronization. 

The graphics are great but some cinematics can show signs of weakness. I don't really know how to explain it. You can tell its a bit dull. Some glitches I guess. I'm sure will be patched.

Overall
I couldn't be more happier with my purchase. Ubisoft has gone above and beyond with this one and have excelled in every possible way from their previous games. Anyone getting it will surely be in awe as they play. I'll answer any questions as well so I hope you guys enjoyed my review.

1370185364.0,102,self.assassinscreed,1firl1,I think I've discovered a way to make a legitimate hidden blade...,UnholyDemigod,127,25,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1firl1/i_think_ive_discovered_a_way_to_make_a_legitimate/,"Now first of all, I'm not an engineer, nor have I done any study in the field, so as far as making this thing goes, or even knowing if it will actually work, I have no idea. 

Any time you see someone with a purchased or homemade hidden blade, they never work the way they do in the games. They either pop out and require being forcibly pushed back in, or you how to 'throw' it out and back in again, kinda like those collapsible plastic swords. This design works the sake way they do in the game: they shoot out, and they shoot back in with a simple wrist movement. In theory anyway. Lets begin! (Excuse the shitty drawings; they're not to scale)

There's 3 different viewpoints I've done in the drawings; there's top view, [side view A](http://i.imgur.com/1GEBuh4.jpg), and [side view B](http://i.imgur.com/ibRMsH3.jpg). 

[This image](http://i.imgur.com/RxuvQcZ.jpg) is for side view A. It shows the panel covering the 'blade box'. That white line is a slit, which a little grabby thing will poke out in case you fuck up the catch and have to manually pull the blade back in. 

[This one](http://i.imgur.com/AnKDBRW.jpg) is both the top view, where the blade comes out (note the peg that is for manual operation as explained earlier), and side view A, only this time the covering has been removed to show the internal mechanisms. The two 'columns' to the side are both hollow, and have a spring at the top and bottom of each side. There's a narrow slit going down each side which will be on the side of the blade compartment, which the blade base will fit into. The circle in the middle is a hole, which a peg will be inserted and kept in place by spring, which when pulled out, will remove the peg from hole (and the hole in the blade) and allow the internal springs to do their work. 

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/Kal3bcu.jpg) we have the blade, and side view A of the blade compartment, this time with the blade inside and sheathed, ready for use. Note both the peg and hole on/in the blade. The wide flat base of the blade is important; it sits on top of the springs, which when the peg is released, will both force the blade up, and down again upon re-release. 

[Image of the blade being extended](http://i.imgur.com/dDmI5v1.jpg). Whereas in the sheathed picture the bottom springs were tight, ready to push the blade up and the top springs were loose, here the roles are reversed; the top springs are tightened ready to force the blade down, and the bottom springs are loose. 

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/VS3P7uX.jpg) is side view B (zoomed out). The little box thing would be up against your wrist (note that the entire thing will be inside another compartment and strapped to a bracer, preventing that part from pressing into your wrist and preventing this thing from working. 

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/42pUEeJ.jpg) is the same image zoomed in to get a better look at the mechanisms. The little box holds two springs, which both push on a flat section which is attached to the peg that releases/catches the blade. Unlike the other springs, these ones never fully loosen; when extended they hold the peg in place, when depressed the are ready to force the peg back into its hole. The line coming out is a piece of string attached to the base of the peg, that leads out of the box, around a roller-type thing, up towards your hand and is attached to a ring. 

---

Now, the way this is supposed to work is this: you wear the ring on your middle finger. When it's killing time, pull your hand backwards toward your elbow. This pulls on the string, which in turn pulls the peg out of the hole (once it's out relax your hand). Now that the peg is out of the hole, the blade is able to move freely up and down. Because the bottom springs were depressed, they force the blade upwards, and the force will depress the top springs into a tight position, allowing the blade too be up to the point where the bottom has moved past the peg-hole, allowing the peg to slot the hole (because the springs are trying to force it back into place), locking the blade in the extended position. You may now kill the bad guy. Once the bad guy is dead, repeat the process. Flick your hand to pull the sting, releasing the blade which causes the top springs to force it back down, and once the holes match up, the peg will insert, locking it in the sheathed position, with the bottom springs ready to force the blade back out. The little peg poking out the front is if it gets caught somehow, or 'misfires', allowing you to manually pull it back into place. 

As I said before, I'm not an engineer, so I have no means of making this. I also have no idea if this is even remotely possible, or just retarded. If someone were to make this, and it turns out the way I envisioned, this could potentially be an extremely dangerous *concealed* weapon, so I shouldn't need to tell you that it will be extremely illegal.

Here's some recent info from him:

* While the AI can swim, only your pirate crew will voluntarily go into water (everyone else will have to be pushed in if you want to see them swim). Brutes can't swim at all.

* Concerning the PC release, the next two months are mostly all about fixing bugs. The PC version will be ""solid.""

* The combat will be more similar to AC3's than AC2's, but with ""major enhancements due to the dual swords, guns and enemy changes.""

* There are ""a lot of costumes for Ed and some have gameplay implications,"" including increasing his health.

* You will be able to find and wear [this coat](http://i.imgur.com/88o4bQv.jpg).

* ""Plenty"" of random events like ones seen in the recent gameplay trailer

* Concerning the open world... ""Explore any time, there's a lot to discover and do outside of missions. The world is massive. Yes there are shops.""

* There will be over 35 sea shanties to collect for your crew to sing.

* There will be more gameplay videos before launch, as well as the Comic-Con panel.

* You can't use the spyglass while not at the helm of the Jackdaw due to technical restraints.

* Three ""huge"" Aveline missions exclusive to PlayStation. Together, they supposedly add just over an hour of content.

* ""Reach high point"" is an internal name. They're still called Viewpoints in-game.

* You will control other ships (not the Jackdaw) in certain missions.

* You won't be able to go on all the land you see, but there will be a lot to go to.

* **[AC3 ENDING SPOILERS]** [spoiler](#s ""While Desmond is dead, his legacy will live on in the series."")

You may already know this, but...

What I loved about AC2 and AC3, was the fact you owned your own Homestead/Villa, you could upgrade it. I would love to see this feature return in ACIV, except that instead of doing missions to improve your little city/town, you could buy buildings and invest in them like AC2, and do missions to improve them, such as getting better tools to the blacksmith, so you could buy more weapons, or get a discount.

**BETTER ECONOMY**

In AC3, I almost forgot about the economy, except when I went to the store to buy arrows or bullets. Other then that, I really didn't use the cash. I would like to see multiple stores brought back, like AC2 where there was a blacksmith where you could get weapons and armor, or a tailor where you could dye your clothes. It was very diverse, and it kept things fresh.

**ARMOR BEING BROUGHT BACK**

I really liked the armor mechanic in the previous games, except for the fact that it can be very OP later in the game where you were basically ""Ezio the Juggernaut"" (if someone could photoshop this, that would be great). I was maybe thinking that we could bring back armor for Edward, where he could buy leather pieces for himself. In the trailers, Edward has some leather on himself. Maybe we can even do a lightweight but durable metal, (not the titanium suit that Ezio had) but I'm not sure that pirates exactly wore metal armor back then. It can possibly something like this: http://gamentrain.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/946114_449133195179476_624953545_n.jpg I also want ship armor that you could buy from the blacksmith, along with the Edward's regular armor.


**ASSASSIN TOMBS**

I think that we can all agree that having Assassin Tombs back would be great. They are fun and enjoyable, as well as sometimes having to use your brain to solve the puzzles. I was thinking that maybe when you complete all of the tombs in ACIV, you could be rewarded with a prize such as the best set of armor in the game (it could possibly the Armor of Eden, but no such thing exists yet in the AC universe, but not too OP) or the Sword of Eden. I always wanted something like the Sword or the Armor of Eden in a AC game.

That about warps it up. Please feel free to share your opinion with.
Thanks!



EDIT



**CRAFTING SYSTEM**

One more thing I would like to mention, is the crafting system. For me, it wasn't that enjoyable, because it's only useful purpose in the game was crafting the special weapons, and selling bear skins to make quick and easy cash. Plus, most of the good stuff, such as the pistols and swords you can craft, were not really available until the near end of the game. Ubisoft, if you are reading this thread, then please try to make the crafting system better so it serves a more useful purpose in the economy, or remove it all together and instead have an AC2 type of economy (which was also incredibly enjoyable) improved and refined.
Please let me know of what you think of this. I would love to hear your opinion. Thanks!

I've only been in to AC games for 3-4 months, so far I've completed the storylines on ACII &amp; ACIII.

So Revelations, I have seen that people rate this game as the worst of the series.  I quite enjoyed it actually, there were lots of fun elements to the game and a few things that I didn't like.

So good things?  I loved the setting.  Constantinople looked fantastic.  I liked the money making feature, I found making money in AC2 too 'easy'.  At one point through play through I completely ignored the storyline for a good few hours and completely focused on Assassin missions, collecting chests and buying shops.  I also found that if I sold all my bomb ingredients I made a good 30-40k in one go.  I found the money making a bit more of a challenge, some times I left Ezio stood at the top of a tower for a few hours just so the money would stack up.
Speaking of bombs, I liked this idea however the whole 'make your own bomb' part didn't interest me, in fact I didn't even make a single bomb, I just purchased them fully made from a dealer.
I didn't experience a single tower defence game throughout the story, I never let my notoriety reach full once apart from 2 missions which resulted in it.  Tower Defence was reviewed as one of the silly parts of the game, so I tried to avoid it.  I also didn't bother with the Animus Island missions, as upon finding out what the missions were...I didn't bother.  I thought the weapons were cool as hell, the enemies were actually quite tough (those Jannisaries!)  I also liked the faction challenges as it gave you a few side things to do.

OK, now the bad.
The storyline was suprisingley short.  I wasn't expecting to finish the storyline when I sat down to play this evening.  When playing open world games I like to align the side missions to the story, so that when I fully complete the story I've also done a hell of a lot of other stuff too.  In this case, it was a bit suprising, as now I've done the story I'm only 62% complete.  I've got tons of challenges to do, only have 2 master assassins, bought about 4 weapons (not even experienced the crossbow yet), bought one landmark and only renovated half the shops.  
I'm expecting Brotherhood to be delivered tommorrow (I know, wrong order) and I really don't have a lot of interest in completing the side stuff in Revelations now that the story is over so quick.  It was literally 2 missions, a book finding and maybe a key location for each sequence!

So yeah, sorry for the essay, I just saw Revelations wasn't rated one of the better games so was hoping there were a few fans in here of the game.  There were lots that I enjoyed, a few things that I did not.  If I restarted I could see myself spending 75% of my time making money, doing challenges and restoring shops and only 25% of the time doing the actual story.  Obviously if I did I would go for full sync as I didn't get full sync on all missions.

This collection of tribes were hired with by the roman templars as part of the first crusades against the Muslims and pagans. There were about 27 family tribes that were apart of this tribe, three of these names were Haddad (my cousins), Hawatmeh, and Swiess (My mother's maiden name).

My grandfather told me this last night during Thanksgiving and blew me away because he has no idea I'm a fan of Assassins Creed. While he was telling me this my uncle interrupted and said, ""Basically, Andy, we kicked ass about 900 years ago. Not just today""

I was amazed by all this and in shock because I was told my ancestors were just boring old farmers who lived Jordan and other parts of Europe for centuries, but I never would've guessed if I went back far enough they would've been Templars!

I agree, but the thought just occurred to me, could it have been on purpose?

Now that I think about it, it could fit perfectly into the story. 

Connor needed to be physical and brutal instead of stealthy to help fight off the red coats/Templar. There was never an order to begin with. This can set up the next game perfectly.

The next game can now focus on getting rid of the Templar and setting up the brotherhood, instead of trying to bring freedom to the colonies. Connor can set up a brotherhood like Ezio. More stealth can be used since it is individual targets instead of fighting off an entire country

I want to look at how Assassin’s Creed has come to be an important cultural text, “a global cultural phenomenon” as Ubisoft have themselves called it. I want to analyse the critical theory of the Assassins, it’s relation to that of the Templars, and how it has permeated modern everyday life – a real world bleeding effect of sorts.

I have a place confirmed at my university, which includes an acceptance of my thesis proposal, but I’ve run into a problem. 

Humanities funding in Britain has been cut 100%. There is no funding available to me to be able to study my Masters degree. 

I tried to raise enough money to pay my own way but, with the job market as it is, I’ve really been struggling. So I’ve decided to appeal directly to Ubisoft, in the hope that they might see my work on their game as valuable and choose to help me out with funding. 

I know it’s a long shot, but I’ve got to try. I really believe in this project and I think it can benefit both my academic field and Ubisoft.
So all I’m asking you guys to do is lend a hand by making this more visible and contribute with comments and advice, in the hope that someone from Ubisoft sees it.
(I don't want to say upvote for visibility as it's bad reddiquette - but it's kinda what I mean...)

And if you have any advice or anything to contribute, please comment. The more discussion the better!

Thanks guys!

1362005011.0,95,self.assassinscreed,19cuwg,For everyone complaining about naval battles being 'out of place',PPohlus,118,23,60,http://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/19cuwg/for_everyone_complaining_about_naval_battles/,"With the announcement of AC IV : Black Flags, there seem to be alot of people displeased with the fact that it will probably be a naval based AC game. One of the main reasons being that the naval warfare is kind of out of place for an assassin.

I just want to bring in a different perspective on those naval battles:

As an assassin, your job is to kill your enemy. The best moment to do so, is when you are close and he doesn't notice or expect it. Aveline in AC3:L would regulary dress up for different occasions, because in certain circumstances wearing your assassin robes would draw attention to you, instead of trying to avoid it.Why can't other assassins do this? Why can't an assassin who's job is to hunt down a Templar at sea, not dress up as a pirate? 

I seems to me that the common misconception is that an assassin doesn't want to be seen at all, I think that's not entirely true. An assassin blends into the environment, becomes a part of it so that he doesn't stand out.

Sure in places like medieval Jerusalem and Rome, the assassin robes were the perfect clothes to avoid being noticed. One wearing such robes could easily pass for a priest or a monk.

In 18th century America/Carribean, the assassin robes are a dead give away of your identity to the templars. 
That is why they embrace things like naval battles, it's nothing extraordinary for that time in that place. It's almost normal. A ship attack could easily pass for pirates trying to loot some cargo, a templar probably wouldn't find out the true intentions of the ship attack untill it's to late.

It's not unusual or out of place for an assassin at all, it's what they must do according to their creed: Hiding in plain sight.


So I hope my explanation here helps some people change their mind about the upcoming game, I personally think it's a setting with alot of potential and am very excited to see what Ubisoft has in store for us.",,False,,t5_2s6v6,1362005280.0,,,True,t3_19cuwg,http://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/19cuwg/for_everyone_complaining_about_naval_battles/,

I finished the main story of ACIII a week or so ago, and while I enjoyed the game and the story, I couldn't help feeling underwhelmed by the ending of Connor's story.

It got me thinking back over the previous games, and I think it might have been deliberate.

Looking all the way back to AC1, the missions and the plot followed Altairs own development.

They were repetitive &amp; objective driven - like Altair was a blind follower. As the truth became clearer to him, the missions changed, culminating in discovering the betrayal - at which point shit got crazy.

Moving on to ACII, and pretty much every target was satisfying to kill - you felt the anger on Ezio's behalf, and wanted revenge, like he did.

The finale was epic and cathartic - fighting across the Vatican to beat down the man who destroyed Ezio's family with your bare hands.

Brotherhood was less epic and felt a bit more formulaic, but then this was Ezio doing what was necessary to revitalise Rome, motivated by need, not emotion.

But chasing down Cesare, once it became clear he couldn't be stopped, was pretty frantic, like Ezio's state of mind.

Now onto Revelations. This game felt less about killing targets as it did about finding Altairs alien-dvds - again, mirroring Ezio's motivations of being done with revenge and killing, just wanting to discover ancient knowledge.

So we're now at ACIII, where every time Connor takes down a target, he seems to make things worse.
Indeed, for me, it felt like the targets deaths served only as way to break up the plot they wrapped around their cool new world and game engine.

In the end, Charles Lee was a dick, but the revelations about who was responsible for the village burning took away a lot of the rationale for hunting him down. 

We never even got to strike the killing blow ourselves - it was all cutscene, with the two men, barely able to stand, acknowledging that they will always be enemies for the simple reason of being on different sides of a long-standing conflict.

So for me, it feels like Ubisoft have made this most recent game bit of an anti-climax, because that’s how Connor feels at the end of his quest – leaving all of us asking ‘so what was all this for?’

Confused as all fuck and questioning his own sanity, he walks out of the vault to find Mario waiting for him, who apparently tagged along without telling you. With the guards after you (you *did* just beat the shit out of the pope), you both decide to get the fuck out of dodge (read: dodge = Vatican City). You both hightail it outa there and arrive back to Monterrigioni.  
* upon arriving, you run around and do some shitkicking jobs, before meeting up with Caterina Sforza, some hot bitch from ACII, who *totally* wants the dick. You give it to her.  
* the next morning, you're rudely awakened by an army laying siege to Monterrigioni. Bastards. You run outside, man the cannons, and lay the smackdown, before they decide to shoot back, knocking you off the wall and injuring you. You then help your sister and the civilians escape through a sneaky backdoor hidden in the villa. After this, the army's captain rocks up. It's Cesare (Che-sa-ray) Borgia, the ACII bad guy's son. He's a total prick (he also slips it to his sister. Filthy cunt). Unfortunately for you, he has Mario prisoner, and he executes him with a brand new firearm, and steals The Apple. Being completely powerless to stop the capture of the city, Ezio flees.  
* you now wake up from the animus as the truck (you're in a truck) pulls into modern day Monterrigioni. Desmond, Lucy (team boss), Rebecca (team technician) and Shaun (team historian) all make camp in the basement of the villa after Desmond and Lucy run through the escape tunnel Ezio used to save the people during the battle and open the door from the inside, but not before noticing a secret message Ezio left behind: 1419,1420,1421.   
* back inside the animus, you awaken as Ezio inside some lady's bed, with your wounds tended to, but told to go to a doctor (turns out you're now in Rome. Again). The doctor fixes you up, and tells you a man of your age should take more caution, which is a sneaky reminder that Ezio is now over 40 years old  
* you run around, hook up with Machiavelli, who takes you to a 'Borgia Tower', which is essentially a bad guy base. There's a bad guy bossman strutting his stuff, so you murder him and set the tower on fire. Each 'suburb' of Rome has its own Tower; you have to do this in each zone to 'free' it.  
* you roam around Rome (hehe, I'm a poet), and are introduced to Tiber Island, the local base for the Assassin's Guild.  
* while running around doing odd jobs and recruiting assassins and training them (a fucking awesome addition, because now you can call call in buddies to help you, and even an 'arrow storm', where you just get arrows raining down on every cunt around you all pew! pew! and ugh, I'm dying! and that), you learn that while Rodrigo is all sad and mopey cos you kicked his arse, his sprog Cesare is running around, snatching up Rome and taking as much power as he can (while still fucking his sister. Filthy cunt. She's hot, but still. *Sister*). For stealing your Apple, destroying your home and killing your uncle, Ezio decides he needs the ultimate revenge: interfere with his plans. Mwahahahahaha.  
* you run around, killing his allies left, right and center, while also helping your own friends too; Caterina had been imprisoned in his castle, so you save her. Bartolomeo (FUCKING. LEGEND) had his wife kidnapped so you help him too by killing some frog poofter. After pissing off Cesare enough, you sneak into the castle again to try and kill Rodrigo, only to find that Cesare does it for you. While killing his old man, his sister told him she knew where the Apple was (dad stole it and hid it, the thieving bastard) to try and stop him, so he smacked her in the chops and ran off to find it. Because you heard it too, you decide to have a race.  
* Ezio wins. Fuck yeah.  
* you then get to run around and show people the Apple, which makes them die. Pretty cool stuff. Cesare runs away like a bitch, before gathering up some buddies and coming back for round 42. You win again, and Cesare finally gets fucking arrested (for incest. Sick fuck).  
* Ezio gets worried that Cesare will escape, so he uses the Apple's magic powers to look into the future (look, don't question the shit, just roll with it, ok?). He doesn't like wha he sees so he fucks off to get him.  
* turns out Cesare *did* escape. He also managed to gather another army. Fuck knows how though. It takes Ezio 4 whole years to catch up with him, at the Siege of Viena. Once again, Cesare runs off like a bitch, so you chase him through a goddamn battfield and up onto the castle walls. You have a fight (which takes ages, but is really awesome), then grab him and throw him off the wall. Does he fly through the air in the manner of a bird? No. He falls to the ground with the manner of a housebrick.  
* the next thing you see is Ezio hiding the Apple in a vault underneath the Colloseum. When you finish, Desmond and the others use this info to find it. You get there, go through the vault using Desmond's wicked-bad free-running, and Shaun's deciphering of Ezio's hidden number message, then finally discover the Apple.  
* **THIS IS WHERE IT GETS EPIC**  
  While free-running, holograms of Juno, another of the 3 TWCB 'gods', appears. Only Desmond is able to see and hear her though, as she starts explaining how humans came to be. They were created to act as slaves in the same image as TWCB, but whereas they had 6 senses, they only gave us 5. However, there was eventually crossbreeding, which resulted in humans having the extra sense, which turns out to be Eagle Vision. Altair, Ezio and now Desmond are all descendants of TWCB.  
* upon reaching the Apple, Desmond grabs it only for time to freeze for everything except his mind. He alone bears witness to Juno telling him that it is their plan for the bloodline to be reborn (meaning two people with TWCB blood to make a baby, producing the purest TWCB possible. Or something like that). To do this, he will have to find 'Eve'. The problem with this is, they think Lucy stands in the way of the pairing, so against his will, Desmond slowly walks over to her (while time is still frozen), and is forced to watch as his arm reaches out and stabs her with the hidden blade. Time resumes playing, Desmond and Lucy both collapse. Desmond stirs as he's being placed in a car. Credits roll.

I've been replaying all the AC games again, and when I came to brotherhood, I noticed something about Brutus that I had never thought of before, so I wanted to spark a discussion here:


Well, in his letters found in the Romulus lairs, he tells the story of how he gained entrance to the vault and the plotting of the assassination of Caesar. Well, here are the things that I find weird:


1. In the ending of AC:B, it's made clear that only a few can actually enter the Vault, those with TWCB DNA. When Shaun tries to activate the pillar in the church, nothing happens, but when Desmond does it works. In the vault, there is a similar pillar, and when Desmond touches it there appears some other pillar-thingy around the apple that you have to climb. Well, in Brutus' [drawing](http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110511123656/assassinscreed/images/2/25/Scroll04.jpg) of the vault, those pillar-thingies are included. This suggests that Brutus also has TWCB DNA. 


2. Desmond and the gang solves the password by ""It's the 72 names for GOD!"", however, since Brutus ""believed"" (if he was religious or not doesn't matter) in the Roman gods, how did he solve this? Any clues? How did Ezio solve it?


3. In Brutus' [drawing](http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110511123656/assassinscreed/images/2/25/Scroll04.jpg), his drawing style is almost identical to the drawing done by Altaïr in [one of the codex pages](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100529014552/assassinscreed/images/3/37/Zw-codex-10.png)
I assume the only rational explanation is that both used the apple for drawing?

You are one of the frumentarii sent to England during the Roman Republic. In your dealing with the local Celtic tribes, you find yourself possessing a druid artifact. A small, golden orb. This becomes a trophy of yours for a while; a symbol of your victory for the Res Publica. Eventually you are contacted by individuals who have also stumbled across such artifacts. From Greece, Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus has uncovered a similar artifact, and Marcus Antonius has been given strange jewelry by his Egyptian consort. You have traveled the breath of the Republic, from Carthage to Athens, collecting artifacts, but none are as powerful as the orb. For this orb has the strangest of abilities; it controls other men. You and your brothers agree to bury them in a hill in Rome. After landing in Rome's port, Ostia Antica, you find that you are not the only one collecting these artifacts. A young upstart from a minor Patrician family, Gaius Julius, has collected similar artifacts from his time in Gaul and Britain. So you and your brothers agree to end this man before he can claim the Republic as his own. You and your brothers hatch a most ingenious plan. They are members of the Senate, but you were born a Plebian. You kill a Patrician noble of note and use the magic of the artifacts to assume his form. Now that you are a Senator, you can bring an end to Gaius Julius. Even if you must kill this man in cold blood.

You are Marcus Junius Brutus

MCV writes on Twitter that the invite lists a February 27 date, which would be next Wednesday.

Might it be time for the reveal of Ubisoft’s next Assassin’s Creed game? During the company’s latest financial call, CEO Yves Guillemot teased that information would be shared “very soon”.

Not much is known about the next Assassin’s Creed. What we do know is that it will feature a new hero and time setting, and is being developed by an “all new team”.

The next Assassin’s Creed will launch before April 2014.

This got me and a few of my friends thinking of what could make this game excellent. What if during the bits out of the animus when none of the staff are around, it becomes a first person stealth/exploration thing. Optional, like in AC1, but you could sneak around Abstergo HQ and uncover secrets, maybe even somehow incorporate first person parkour, a la mirror's edge. After awhile you uncover little bits of what's really going down in regard to Juno and the remaining Assassins. 

You could uncover notes/emails/sound files/whatever from Shawn and Rebecca and Bill, then at the end you get sprung from the joint and put all that first person stealth, parkour, and maybe even combat to use.

According to this user, the code is in Base64 and it means VSPCPSVT. From there, they replaced the letters with the previous letter and it spells out: UROBORUS. The user then found that the symbol of Uroborus was on an important document called the ""Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen"". It is the fundamental document to the French Revolution. This document was written by none other than Marquis de Lafayette who was present in AC3.

If you have spoken to Lafayette, he tells Connor about maybe one day taking him to France. He also mentions that are things happening in France and the country's ""heart is black"". Lafayette is determined to make ""France's heart glow once more"". As we know, AC3 ended in 1783. The French Revolution starts in 1789. Could this be a hint for the next Assassin's Creed game?

1351990344.0,91,self.assassinscreed,12l9ty,So you need help crafting? (A guide I made in response to someone asking. Thought I'd put it here for others who might want to ask.),kaberton,101,10,71,http://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/12l9ty/so_you_need_help_crafting_a_guide_i_made_in/,"Okay, so you want to craft things. Well, let's cover some of the basics.

* How do I craft things? 

 Well, you can use trial and error in combining elements, or you can find recipes to know how to make things. I personally recommend recipes. Basically, in the crafting menu, pick a recipe you want to make, and see if you have the needed items to make it. If not, look at what those items are. 

 Let's say we want to make a barrel, that sounds easy enough. So, we go to recipes, scroll down to materials, and select the barrel recipe. We notice that we need one oak lumber, but we do not have one. So, exit out of the crafting portion, and scroll left to the stockpile. Under the tab that has everything the lumberjacks find, we see oak lumber. Go ahead and buy the lumber from them. Now we can make that barrel. 

 Some recipes call for things you have to make. Apple cider for instance, requires apples, and one oak barrel. So you'd have to make the barrel you need for it if you don't have one already in your stockpile. Recipes make it all easier, and I suggest following them so you're not wasting time on combinations that don't work. 
 
* Where do I find recipes?

 Well, there are a few different ways. One of the best is by opening chests in the frontier or in New York. You'll sometimes find a bit of cash to go with it, but in those two places, you'll find recipes galore. You can also get recipes from leveling the artisans in your homestead. Which leads me to...

* Is it a good idea to / How do I level my artisans?

 You level your artisans by completing the homestead missions. Yes, your plot of land is going to become a bit more packed, but it's very very worth it. Completing all the homestead missions when they come out also helps tie you into the main story. Especially before you finish the game. Woah, tangent there. Leveled artisans can make better stuff, and that better stuff can either get you more money, or upgrade Connor.

* Make money, is this a good way to make money, why can't I just buy a bank or something?

 Well, I like to think that by doing it this way, Ubisoft is trying to say that life in the Colonies in this time was *hard*. That applies to all things, the war, the gangs, and even making honest money. However, if you know how to go about it, making money gets a little bit simpler. Early on, after completing the early homestead missions, you'll be able to make a fair bit by selling beaver pelts. After all of the missions are done (and maybe a bit before) you can reap in much more by making Sails. Especially if you've built naval convoys.

* Wait, upgrading Connor?

 Yes sir! Gone are the days of going to umpteen different stores for umpteen different upgrades for your assassin. Now it's all handled by crafting. Very early on you can see a recipe for dual holsters, but lack the means to make it. This is just one of many upgrades that Connor can get, but I'll let you see the different ones. They're in the same menu that the game showed you when it showed you how to make a convoy. 

TLDR: Use Recipes, Find all the recipes you can, do homestead missions, sell goods, upgrade Connor.",,False,,t5_2s6v6,False,,,True,t3_12l9ty,http://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/12l9ty/so_you_need_help_crafting_a_guide_i_made_in/,

He then takes his mum and sister to the brothel to hide, gets a bit of practise at being sneaky, finds Alberti at a courtyard, and murders the utter fuck out of him.  
* he gets his mum and sister and fucks off out off Florence, but is stopped by Vieri de Pazzi, a rival, and his goons. Before they can kill Ezio, Mario, Ezio's uncle, rocks up and saves the day, before taking them all to Mario's villa estate in Monterrigioni.  
* Ezio wants to leave straight away to get revenge, but Mario convinces him to stay and train (for 4 years, it turns out. The time passes a lot like that) After Ezio's wicked-bad with a blade, Mario grabs a bunch of croneys and goes off to kill Vieri, who's been promoted from 'local dropkick' to 'major douche'. Ezio tags along, kills him good and proper, and even has the time to throw in some quality Italian profanity  
* after talking with Mario, Ezio decides to help him hunt down the rest of the Pazzi family, and stop them from being cunts by stabbing them until they die. This takes place over the better part of a decade, and several Italian cities. Ezio gets totally awesome at murder.  
* Ezio finds out that the Pazzi have been working for somebody called 'The Spaniard' (probably because he's Spanish), who is the leader of the Templars, and it was him who was behind his family's execution all those years ago.  
* Ezio gets pissed again, and begins to systematically assassinate people under the Spaniard in order to get close and fuck his shit right up. He trails some goons who have picked up a shipment from the docks, something they call 'The Apple' (!!!!!!), and it leads him to the Spaniard, who reveals himself as Rodrigo Borgia. He says some shit about a prophet and a prophecy before Mario and other friends Ezio made over the years show up and help fight the bad guys off. Borgia manages to escape unharmed.  
* Ezio's confused, until everybody reveals themselves as member of the Assassin Brotherhood, and say that they'd been there to discover who the prophet was; the prophecy said the prophet could appear to claim the apple, which is exactly what Ezio did, meaning he's the prophet (***DUN DUN DUNNNNNN***). They then induct him into the Brotherhood.  
* there is then a glitch with the Animus, which causes sequence 12 and 13 to skip. (it's available as DLC as the Bonfire of the Vanities. Pretty good stuff). In the ten years that were skipped, Borgia became Pope Alexander the 6th. You now need to go to Rome and *assassinate the most powerful man in Europe, if not the world*. Fuck yeah.  
* you get to Rome, go to church, jump on his head, but he survives. You then fight. He takes the apple after you dropped it and sticks it onto the papal staff (which is another Piece Of Eden; turns out there's fucking shitloads of them) and uses magic because he's a cheating cunt. He beats you up, then activates a secret panel which opens a secret door, which leads to a secret vault (it's all very secretive), which only the prophet can open.  
* you follow him down to the vault door, but he can't open it because he's not the prophet (as if the bad guy would be). You beat him up with your fists but let him live, then open the door and walk in.  
* **HERE'S WHERE IT GETS EPIC**  
  An image appears of what looks like a holographic image of a woman wearing robes. She calls herself Minerva, and says she's from a civilisation called 'Those Who Came Before', a highly advanced race of people who are *above* humans. As it turns out, they *created humans*, in their image to serve in subservience. It's from them that all deity myths originate. They were at the height of civilisation when something catastrophic hit (most likely a solar flare), that kill almost all of them and left only about 10,000 humans alive. They died, but humans managed to live on. She then tells Ezio that she's here to deliver a message to hopefully help prevent this from happening again. She then looks over Ezio's shoulder, and says ""it's up to you now, *Desmond*""  
* Ezio gets confused, Desmond says ""what the fuck"", credits roll

Other things: Desmond experiences the bleeding effect and learns freerunning and fighting, and hallucinates a little bit. At the end, Warren Vidic and the Templars show up. You fight them off, but then you have to escape your hideout.

And the there's 'The Truth'. After discovering a bunch of hidden stuff and solving a shitload of puzzles, you unlock a video that goes for about a minute of an animus memory. It starts by saying the date is unknown, then shows two naked people, a man and woman, running through a futuristic city. They see people working, guarded by someone holding the Apple, before it shows the two people climbing a building, then the man says ""I have it Eve"" and shows her the Apple. She calls him Adam and the video ends. 

The meaning of this is thus: Adam and Eve actually existed. They lived in Eden, a city built by TWCB. They steal the Apple, which grants them knowledge.",,False,,t5_2s6v6,1348424755.0,,360,True,t3_10ce5o,http://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/10ce5o/story_synopsis_assassins_creed_2/,moderator

However when playing the mission to free prisoners without being seen, I kept getting spotted. So I asked a friend to look at the map for me, and he said the enemies are marked on there. Problem is, I'm colorblind and can't see these markings.

I wonder if this happens more in games. Before I played AC2 and had no problems there. But maybe I just didn't notice it was supposed to be easier.

So, is there any way to change the colors of the maps or markings? Using the brightness adjustment does nothing for me.",,False,,t5_2s6v6,False,,,True,t3_1i5ibh,http://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1i5ibh/how_to_play_ac3_when_colorblind/,
