Dear [insert senator's name],
The Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA) has once again been introduced in the House. Like last year's CISPA, this bill threatens our basic digital civil liberties.

CISPA's passage would be a major blow to our online privacy, and it would have a chilling effect on our freedom to connect online. We won’t feel as free to state unpopular opinions, or to speak truth to power, if we know that Big Brother could get a feed of everything we say and do.

1364739814.0,46,self.Ohio,1bcwvz,"/r/Ohio, my best friend died from a gunshot wound to the head, and our local police(Sandusky) did a horrible job investigating the case. We need your help.",ritter,86,40,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ohio/comments/1bcwvz/rohio_my_best_friend_died_from_a_gunshot_wound_to/,"https://www.change.org/petitions/ohio-attorney-general-mike-dewine-take-authority-over-the-jacob-limberios-shooting-saga-investigation

Jacob Limberios died by gunshot wound to the head on March 2, 2012 around 9:30 P.M.  Jacob was hanging out with three other acquaintances in a house the night he was shot.  The three witnesses, along with Jacob, all took a turn test firing a gun in the backyard of the house prior to Jacob’s death.  Alcohol was consumed prior to the test firing.  After test firing the gun, Jacob and the three witnesses went inside the house.  At that time, Jacob completely unloaded the gun onto the floor.  One of the witnesses at the house picked both the casings and the live round up from the floor.  Apparently, Jacob then reloaded the live round into the gun.  Jacob then handed the gun to another witness whom requested to see the gun again.  The gun was supposedly passed around among the three witnesses.  One of the witnesses admitted that Jacob warned the others to be careful because there was a live round was in the chamber.
 
Around that time, Jacob was shot in the head.  All three of the people at the house contended that Jacob shot himself.
 
Within minutes of the shooting, the Sandusky County Sheriff’s Department was dispatched to the scene.  Two officers were the first to arrive at the scene, and within an hour, the Sandusky County Sheriff also arrived.  At one point, the Officers were heard laughing over Jacob’s dead body, with one of them questioning who was going to pick up the bill for clean up.  This occurred while Michael Limberios, Jacob’s father, stood outside the house in the freezing cold, grieving the loss of his son.
 
In violation of its own standard procedure, no Detective was called to the scene that night.  In addition to not calling a qualified investigator to the scene, the Sheriff’s Department: did not separate the three witnesses; did not call in the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation; did not call in the Coroner; did not require the witnesses to take a breathalyzer, or otherwise determine their blood/alcohol content; did not collect the evidence that would assist in determining the amount of alcohol that had been consumed; allowed one of the witnesses to change her clothes at the death scene without taking them into evidence; allowed another witness to throw away his blood-splattered shoes in the Deputy’s presence; did not retrieve the bullet from the attic of the residence; did not collect DNA or fingerprints from the witnesses; did not submit the gun for testing, or otherwise having appropriate tests conducted; did not take measurements of the room, did not document the location of physical evidence in the room, did not document the location of the bullet hole in the ceiling, and/or did not document the location of where the bullet lodged in the attic; did not collect and preserving Jacob’s clothing; did not require Jacob’s body to be properly examined to gather valuable forensic evidence; and allowed Jacob’s body to be removed, embalmed and buried within a matter of days.
 
Further there were several inconsistencies with the statements given by the three witnesses in the house that night.  In particular, at least one witness stated that Jacob warned the others that the gun was loaded but later contended that Jacob may not have known the gun was loaded.  The assertion that Jacob may not have known the gun was loaded was adopted by the Sheriff’s Department and the Coroner in their official reports.  In fact, on Jacob’s Death Certificate, the Sandusky County Coroner specifically stated: “deceased shot self in the head, may not have realized the gun was loaded.”
 
Further, two of the witnesses at the house told investigators that Jacob was facing the sofa at the time of the shooting.  This could not be true because it was physically impossible for the shooting to have occurred in the manner described given the layout of the room and considering that the entry wound was on the top, left side of Jacob’s skull.  In order for Jacob to be facing the couch he would have had to been facing a westerly direction, and the bullet would have travelled towards the north or west side of the residence. However, in reality the bullet travelled toward the south side, went into the ceiling, and lodged in a beam in the attic.
 
Also, troubling, the three people that witnessed the shooting admitted that the gun was moved (after the 9-1-1 dispatcher told them not to move it).
 
The Sandusky County Coroner’s ruling of “suicide”, yet contending that Jacob “may not have realized the gun was loaded”, was based on the contentions of the Sheriff’s Department after the Sheriff’s Department did not call a qualified Detective to the scene of Jacob’s death, did not properly collect evidence, and freely permitted the destruction of valuable evidence.  Further, the Sandusky County Coroner made the determination of essentially accidental suicide, which to this day he sticks by, without examining the death scene, without examining Jacob’s body, without gathering or reviewing any forensic evidence, and without talking to a single witness.
 
Renowned forensic pathologist Dr. Cyril Wecht has declared that the Sandusky County’s Coroner’s ruling on Jacob’s death certificate was wrong.  Dr. Cyril Wecht determined that, based upon his observations of the forensic autopsy he performed on Jacob’s body in September 2012, Jacob’s death was by homicide.  Such observations included a lack of “stippling” at the entry wound site.   Dr. Wecht stated as follows. “(i)n my professional opinion, based on a reasonable degree of medical and scientific certainty, there is no way that Limberios could have shot himself, either by accident or with suicidal intent.  The shot had to be fired by someone else, and that Jacob’s death was a result of a homicide.”
 
After the investigation was closed initially the night of Jacob’s death, Jacob’s family continued to question the circumstances of Jacob’s death.  However, despite the family’s continuing questions, the Sheriff’s Department refused to conduct any further investigation, declaring the investigation “over” on April 9, 2012.  Jacob’s parents were forced to hire Counsel.  Over the course of the next few months, Counsel repeatedly tried to contact the Sandusky County Coroner, who refused to talk or communicate with Counsel.  In addition, Counsel repeatedly asked the Sandusky County Prosecutor to conduct an autopsy of Jacob.  Those requests were refused. 
 
After several months of requesting Sandusky County officials to conduct a proper investigation into the death of their son, and continuous refusal to do so, Jacob’s parents, Michael and Shannon Limberios, were forced to file a case on October 19, 2012 (over seven months after Jacob’s death).  Finally, on November 2, 2012, it seemed that Sandusky County was going to reopen the investigation into Jacob’s death.  However, to date, and over a year after Jacob’s death, it seems that Sandusky County still has not conducted a meaningful investigation into his death. 
 
The Sandusky County Prosecutor and his successor have sought delays in Jacob’s family’s search for the truth, have accused them and their Counsel of manufacturing evidence, have publicly suggested that Michael and Shannon Limberios “bought and paid for” results of the autopsy report that suggested Jacob did not kill himself, have publicly suggested that they have evidence to support their untenable position that Jacob shot himself but have not shared what that evidence is.  Even more so, Sandusky County has refused Michael and Shannon Limberios’ requests to have the as the Ohio Attorney General come in and take over the investigation. 
 
All of the above actions have taken a tremendous emotional and economic toll on Michael and Shannon Limberios. They have repeatedly stated that all they want is to know what happened to their son on the night that he died.  With each passing day Michael and Shannon Limberios suffer more grief, not only from the loss of their son, but also from the what seems to be the repeated and incessant refusal of Sandusky County to conduct a meaningful investigation which would give them the answer to what happened to Jacob.  Given this, they have not even begun to heal from their horrible loss. 
 
Please help the Limberios family, including Jacob’s young daughter, Ella, to find out the truth about what happened to Jacob.  You can do so by going to the petition that is pinned to the top of this post and requesting that the Ohio Attorney General’s Office finally take over the investigation of Jacob’s death.  Also, please ask others to join in on our efforts and sign and share the petition.  We can’t thank you enough for your continued support.",,False,self,t5_2qn7b,False,,,True,t3_1bcwvz,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ohio/comments/1bcwvz/rohio_my_best_friend_died_from_a_gunshot_wound_to/,

[edit] I am an idiot and have been so wrapped up in this i forgot other people probably do not know about the issue so:
there is more information in [this article](http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2011/10/18/sb5-concessions.html) and at [We Are Ohio](http://www.weareohio.com/) but basically Issue 2 (if passed) would limit collective bargaining for public unions. what this means practically is the firemen and policemen will not be able to negotiate for safe staffing levels. Teachers will be unable to negotiate for small class sizes and the number of paramedics will be reduced. a common argument for issue 2 is that unions will take advantage of the local governments and throw us into debt. However, since 2008 public employees have given back at least 1 billion dollars in wages/furlough days/vacation days/etc. 
The bill also takes away the employment advantages for returning veterans.
During the legislative process, while thousands were, protesting outside, they locked the doors of the State House (affectionately known as ""the Peoples House"") keeping out the voices of fire, teachers, and police.
After SB5 was implemented, we got 1.3million signatures to exercise a citizens veto. (that was a state record!) Now we need to prove to the extreme politicians that we meant what we said; we want this repealed.

I'm a volunteer for FreedomOhio, an organization that is working to get an amendment legalizing same sex marriage on the November 2013 ballot. We need over 380,000 signatures to do it. We need a certain portion of those signatures to come from at least 44 of the counties. So, we need a lot of signatures from all over the state.

You can help by collecting signatures. FreedomOhio's website has a self service volunteer section, so it's easy to do. The steps are:

Sign up. Print your booklet. Collect signatures. Input the information about your signees. Mail the booklet to FreedomOhio headquarters. Pat yourself on the back for helping to work toward equality.

This issue is simple: it changes that age to 75. Proponents say that people are living longer and with age comes wisdom. Opponents say that sometimes judges are not as sharp as they used to be, but people are afraid to tell them to step down.

Issue 2: This is clearly an extremely controversial issue. ""No"" repeals SB 5, the collective bargaining law passed by the General Assembly this past year. ""Yes"" means the law is enacted. The main thing the law does is limit collective bargaining for public employees at the state and local level. They remain free to negotiate for wages, ""terms and conditions,"" and in the case of firefighters and police, ""safety issues."" They specifically are not allowed to bargain to pay less than 15% of their health care and less than 10% of their salary for their pensions. It also prohibits all public employees from striking (police and fire already cannot strike). It also forbids automatic pay increases every year, but rather requires that all raises be based on performance evaluations. All of these provisions would go into effect whenever the current contracts expire. Proponents of the bill say that this brings the public sector in line with the private sector, and that Ohio's local governments are going broke from these costs. Opponents say this is an attack on middle class workers, and that public sector jobs are oftentimes more difficult (police/fire/teachers) and the health care and pension benefits are appropriate and also necessary to keep good people on the job. They also say that Republicans are trying to bust up the unions, because the unions only donate money to Democrats.

Issue 3: This issue adds a line to the state constitution that says that Ohioans cannot be compelled to purchase health care against their will. Proponents say that the federal health care law's requirement that everyone pay for insurance is unconstitutional and that the state should stand up for people's personal freedoms in this area and line up Ohioans for potential legal challenges if they so choose. Opponents say that the individual mandate is constitutional, and there are potential side effects with Medicaid contributions if this would go into the constitution.",,False,self,t5_2qn7b,False,,,True,t3_m1gwg,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ohio/comments/m1gwg/basic_information_about_issues_13_without_telling/,

I think it is time that Ohio stand up and follow Colorado and Washington's example.  I have a couple different theories on what is the best way to pursue this.

Now I know that most states legalize marijuana for medical purposes first, but we have been slow on that. So I am suggesting we just skip that step and go straight for legalization.  

My initial idea on how to pursue this, is to create a group and lobby the ohio state reps and senators.  I think trying to pass it through the state legislature might be a less expensive option than trying to make it a ballot issue.  (They tried last election but were unable to get the required number of signatures... though I dont think it was because no one wanted to sign it. I firmly believe getting the signatures would be fairly easy.)  

I am suggest that we use either Colorado's law or Washington's law as a model for Ohio instead of developing our own.  I would like to make it an issue about personal freedom, crime reduction, and the economic stimulation.  Now I am very open to new ideas, so please if you think you have a better way to go about all this, then by all means let me know, I am very interested in hearing it.  I am being very serious about this, and would like to do this as professionally as possible (by professionally I mean, making this new industry look as legitimate as possible and not a bunch of stoners who just want to smoke).

We're driving all across the country so at various cities we might organize a bunch of meetups like this. 

Sometime in Mid-May on a weekday we (/u/bobshayd and I) plan on going to arguably the greatest roller coaster park in America, [Cedar Point](https://www.cedarpoint.com/). We could go alone and it would be a total blast (been there once before) but we thought this time it would be fun to go with some friends. Apparently the friends I thought I had in Ohio either don't live in Ohio or I just don't know them and they must have been friends of friends.

Anyway, if there's one thing I know about Reddit, it's that Reddit loves [hilarious pictures taken on roller coasters](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/search?q=roller+coaster+pic&amp;sort=relevance&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all).

And Reddit probably loves just being on roller coasters too.

Thank you for contacting me.  I appreciate hearing from you.
 
  In June 2013, media outlets reported on the selective unauthorized release of classified information regarding intelligence collection activities being carried out by U.S. government agencies under provisions of the PATRIOT Act and the FISA Amendments Act of 2008.  The selective release created confusion and concern in our national discourse regarding the appropriate balance between national security and civil liberties, and I appreciate the opportunity to address the serious and thoughtful questions that have arisen since the unauthorized disclosures. 
 
 On June 9, 2013, media outlets reported that defense contractor Edward Snowden identified himself as the individual responsible for the unauthorized release of classified information regarding intelligence collection activities.  On June 14, 2013, U.S. prosecutors filed a criminal complaint against Mr. Snowden for the unauthorized release of classified information regarding National Security Agency (NSA) surveillance programs citing offenses concerning the theft of government property, unauthorized communication of national defense information, and willful communication of classified intelligence information with unauthorized persons.  Mr. Snowden permitted the Guardian (UK) and the Washington Post to publish his name, but fled to Hong Kong before he could be taken into custody. 
Following the media reports, President Obama outlined that these are important national security programs to help keep Americans safe, and give us tools to fight the terrorist threats that we face.  The president also outlined that there are appropriate safeguards in place to make sure that privacy is not being violated here at home.  The disclosure of this information puts Americans at risk because it shows our adversaries what our capabilities are, and it is a great violation of the law.
 
  Furthermore, the disclosures are about two different intelligence programs, neither of which is focused on collecting the content of the communications of Americans.  Unless they obtain a court order based upon probable cause, U.S. intelligence agencies (including the NSA) cannot target U.S. persons or persons located inside the United States to obtain the content of their phone calls, emails, or Internet communications.  Under the Business Records section of the PATRIOT Act, so-called ""metadata"" is collected, which consists mostly of the type of information that would appear on a customer's phone bill, such as the numbers dialed, as well as the date, time, and duration of the calls.  One important difference, however, is that the metadata, unlike a telephone bill, is not tied to individual subscribers.  It also does not confirm an individual's geo-location.  It is impossible, based on the type of information collected, to have access to the content of telephone conversations under this provision.  The program works to identify terrorist leads and thwart plots inside the U.S. 
 
 In Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act, Congress authorized the Executive Branch to target the content of the communications of foreign individuals outside the United States who are engaged in a variety of activities hostile to the national security interests of the United States, including terror attack plotting and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  The law is explicit; no American may be targeted anywhere in the world under Section 702, and no individual may be targeted who is located inside the United States.  The government is also expressly prohibited from targeting a foreign national with the sole intent of learning what a U.S. person is saying to that individual.  This is known as the prohibition on ""reverse targeting."" 
 
 Both programs are regularly audited by the NSA Inspector General and the Department of Justice, and both programs are reviewed routinely by federal judges who are members of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.  In addition, information regarding these classified programs has been made available to all Members of Congress and Congress has acted repeatedly, with full awareness of these programs, to reauthorize both provisions of law.
 
Thank you again for contacting me with your thoughts.  Please don't hesitate to inform me of your concerns in the future.  To sign up for email updates, I invite you to visit my website at http://johnboehner.house.gov.
 


Sincerely,

John A. Boehner

So here is my proposal. We have lots of programming brain power at our disposal, although not seated in my chair.

(x-post with /r/columbus),Chosenwaffle,22,3,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ohio/comments/v8ryn/local_game_development_company_getting_off_the/,"Hi everyone, this will be a bit longer than I'd like so here's your TL;DR!
**TL;DR Invocation of Awesome LLC is a video game development company located in Columbus, OH and is already far into the development of their first title, support them at their [Facebook Page](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Invocation-of-Awesome-LLC/170446223029254)**

Hey guys! My name is R.J. and I represent Invocation of Awesome LLC, a local video game development company that has been in the works for several years now, made up of some of the most devoted gamers and intellectual minds that exist today. I want to quickly break down the company for you, as well as why we decided to do what we are doing.

First of all, you can find our company facebook page [here!](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Invocation-of-Awesome-LLC/170446223029254) where you will receive near constant updates on the progress of our game and company.
Second, we are currently in the process of building our web presence, so no dedicated website as of yet, but that is one of the first things on our to-do list.

***Why Ohio?***
Simply put, we believe that there are plenty of intelligent, talented people in the Columbus area who, due to circumstance, are unable/unwilling to go to a place like California in order to follow their dream of getting into the gaming industry, more so than almost any other city or state in the U.S. We have a team of extremely talented people already, but as we grow and expand, we believe where we are will provide us with access to an enormous pool of super talented individuals who can help us transform Columbus into a hub of gaming and game development.

**About IoA:**
Invocation of Awesome has been in the works for about eight years now. However, back then, it was only a far-fetched dream that a few kids had as they devoted most of their free time to learning how to code. Every one of us grew up playing games, making our own games in our heads, and impressing our teachers with our knowledge and creativity. Finally, after we finished our schooling and expanded our talents in the coding field, we decided to make that dream a reality and created Invocation of Awesome.

We strive to live up to our name in everything we do. Simply put, we want to invoke awesome. We want the people playing our games to drop their jaws in awe of what we have accomplished, we want to cause suffocation related deaths from our fans forgetting to breath due to being so awe struck (or occasionally just from laughing too hard for a good 30 minutes or so), and we want to make a name for ourselves in not only the gaming community, but in the artistic community as well. I think I speak for everyone I work with when I say that our life-goal is to win the nobel peace prize for uniting the world in glorious virtual combat. Reasonable, no?

So, what could possibly set us apart from the companies that already exist? Especially in a world where indie games are king, and a world where thousands of individuals and small companies are playing one big game of King of the Hill? Vision. Our CEO is a true visionary, and I couldn't imagine anyone else holding the reigns on this operation than him. We truly have a sense on what the industry is lacking, and desire nothing more than to bring it to the table and create games that are fun for us, and games that will help the industry flourish and grow even more than it already has.

Our First Title: **FantastiQuest**

FantastiQuest is the start of our dreams being realized. Its the first stepping stone to accomplishing over 8 years worth of dreams and hard work. FantastiQuest fills a role virtually untapped by the gaming industry, and a role which we feel will be immensely successful and, more importantly, a sickening amount of fun.

FantastiQuest will be a 2.5D PC (and hopefully Mac) specific fighting game with an emphasis on finesse and strategy, as opposed to button mashing and combo-practicing. The game will have fully customizable controls as well as a robust online-multiplayer that strongly encourages competitive play. While I won't reveal too much about the game, as it is still deep in development and everything is subject to change, I will say that every character currently in its later stages of development feels insanely unique and yet still incredibly well balanced.

While the main focus of FantastiQuest (and all of our games) will always be gameplay, it is also going to be an incredible pseudo-satire on the sci-fi and fantasy genres. It is a fully serious game, but will utilize many humorous and wtf moments that poke fun at the oftentimes cliched nature of both genres. (Does a portable, muffin-bomb making, wrist-mounted oven gadget tickle anyone's fancy?)

*So if you are a gamer, or just a redditor who wants to support a growing local industry, please like our [Facebook Page](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Invocation-of-Awesome-LLC/170446223029254) and tell your friends to do the same. While it helps us out a lot, it also helps out the industry, and the community, so thank you for your support, and we look forward to providing you with the highest grade entertainment any team of gentlemen can offer!*

A few friends and I are riding our bikes from Toronto, Canada to your beautiful State!
We're thinking of checking out ""Melt Bar &amp; Grilled"" for some good eats in Cleveland. Then Riding to Sandusky to stay the night.

* Any other recommended stops we should take along the way?
* **RIDERS** - know any great roads?
* Perhaps any places to eat in Sandusky where the park won't r*pe our wallets? 
* Is lodging at Cedar Point worth it? (I'm seeing a $34/N promo)
* How is the weather around this time? (May11) 
* Is it usually packed on opening day? I'm thinking the weather and school plays a part in a not so busy day

Thanks for your input! Looking forward to the trip!

**UPDATE** : 
Thank you to all you wicked cool Ohioans for responding to my thread! We're really excited about this trip and your advice will help 100% in making our trip go a lot smoother.

* I guess opening day is a no go. We might take your advice and wait a week or two.
* For clarification purposes, we're riding our motorcycles, so we're looking for some nice scenic roads along the way. Cycling would take a crazy long time but good points in case that idea ever comes to fruition.
* As for lodging, we're thinking of those 6-man cottages on-site. They seem perfect for a small group and a great place to party up afterwards. Any experiences with them?

I asked to see the gun to prove that i was going that fast, and he said he didn't catch me on the radar gun. Comes back, gives me a ticket for 90 in a 65. 

1) Can he ""tell me my speed"" when he didn't even use a radar gun?
2) If the cop doesn't show up to the court date, isn't the case dismissed?

Second case.

Driving south on 75, and i get off the interstate. Highway patrol pulls me over for following too close to a vehicle. Asks me to step out of the vehicle, and asks if he can pat me down. Pats me down, and asks me to sit in the back of the cruiser. I sit back there, and he writes me the ticket (his passenger did, actually). Asks me to sign it, i refuse. Gives me the ticket..i leave.

Then flipping to 'live' FOX coverage the reporter said the turnout was a disappointment and only about 3,000 people showed up and behind them was what I assume is the backside of the capital with no one gathered around. I know the numbers are not a huge matter of importance but to have two stations reporting such huge difference its rubbish. I realize FOX lies but cam'man!

I'm a student at University of Dayton and just curious to any redditors who may have been or witnessed the gathering at the capital. For some reason it really bothers me such a stark difference about something going on at the same time. The CNN and FOX vans could very well have been parked right next to one another.

In the house across from mine a young couple got into a dispute and the male ended up becoming physical with the woman, and he slammed her into a wardrobe. She locked herself in the bathroom and he kicked down the door. She then ran from the house across the street to my house, where my parents called the cops. I was not home for this, but I recently returned and overheard the police talking to the victim. The suspect is now held up in the house, and refuses to come out. It is confirmed that the suspect has gun(s?). The swat team has been called. Spike strips have been set below the tires of the cars. I will bring more updates as I watch and listen, if anyone is interested. I can also give proof if need be.

Proof:It was on Village Court. Right by the McDonalds and Kroger on Dayton-Xenia. And here is the link to the news story. The news actually says that it happened on Rodenbeck, but it was on the other side which is actually Village Court. Here is a video.

I would like to seek your help for some advice.


Short story: My Girlfriend is in Ohio and is a Nanny/Au pair there. She is from Germany. 


Now this little Son of a Gun 10 year old prick Kid, took a Hokey bat (I hope it is the right term) and assaulted her with it, tried to hit her and what not. He did not get her in the face, but on the Body. 


So right after that the dad called her and yelled at her because the kid tried to hit her... WTF? 


So I would like to seek for some options to get back at this fucked up family, because my girlfriend is devastated and wants to leave immediately America. 


Are there any legal terms that could make them suffer a bit?


I am sorry for this revenge act, but this family is so crazy... all the stories I heard and how many times she got assaulted from a 10 year old.
This may sound awkward, but my girlfriend is kind of small and not very tall and strong, this 10 year old on the other hand is pretty stong and tall for his age, and when he does have a “weapon” he is clearly in advantage of her.
Please help me :/

Please excuse my bad English

Mack is a computer tech and I am an opera/jazz singer and choral conductor.

**If you cannot show up Monday, please get there early Tuesday morning!**

We were contacted at the 11th hour by a woman whose home has been foreclosed upon and sold at sheriff's auction to Fannie Mae. She has been working hard to secure charity and welfare funds to keep her two children (5 and 7 yr) off the street. Working with every government agency and doing the right thing.

Unfortunately her husband -who is separated from her- is the name on the mortgage, and has refused to sign any of the paper work needed to modify the mortgage or hold off the foreclosure process.

This woman and her two children are set to be kicked out of their house at 11:30 am on Tuesday 11/15 because Fannie Mae is more concerned about bureaucracy than humanity.

The woman simply asked to be allowed to PAY RENT to stay in what will otherwise become an abandoned property. Is that so much to ask? Fannie Mae has no plans of putting this property on the market any time soon. So they essentially want to kick two innocent children out in to the street for no discernable reason.

This is an urgent call to action for all regional #Occupy movements and all those who care about building a future with more justice to show up, stand up, and speak up for a more just society.

This kitten showed up on our porch a few days ago, and then made our welcome mat his home. A local cat savior stopped by and gave him flea and worm meds, and we have him on some oral meds for his mild upper respiratory infection. He's a brown classic tabby (he's got the marbly whorls, as you can see in [this album](http://imgur.com/a/qHyBc)), and super friendly: he will drop at your feet and go belly up for some affection. I hope we can find someone to foster or adopt him; until then we will look out for him. (We currently have four cats, and the little new edition is rooming with our 2-month-old son. As much as we want to keep him, our resources and space are stretched.)  

  


I hope someone can adopt, foster, or offer some resources for either one of those options. We have been in touch with local shelters and the cat savior network c: but we want to find a solution for him as soon as we can. We can transport him as well.

Is it legal for a warranty on your product to be changed after you buy it?  Why are they still advertising they offer in home warranty repairs if they don't?

I've never contacted the BBB or State Attorney General about a problem like this.  Can I expect results?  IMO Westinghouse should be required to send a tech over to my house and fix this TV!

Just as he’s about to jump in front of a bus, he’s saved by Marcus, a charming high school dropout/street musician. The two begin an uneasy friendship when Marcus enlists the musically challenged Troy to become the drummer in a new punk rock band. As Troy’s relationship with Marcus grows, Troy’s father becomes increasingly concerned about his son’s new friendship.

This is not a typical Hollywood film and private screenings like this are the ONLY way you can see this movie right now. If you have ever felt like a misfit or like you don't belong, then this movie is for you. It's about an alienated high school kid - a lost kid - who finds his way through punk rock. Songs are created by Pearl Jam's Mike McCready and the film is directed by Matthew Lillard who channels his role from SLC Punk to bring KL Going's book to life.

This film is totally unique and may not make it back around again so come check it out, now!


The screening will be on Thursday August 16 at 7:30pm at AMC Lennox Town Center 24.

**54 people have to reserve tickets by August 9th for the event to actually happen.** Please tell your friends, family, or random people on the street. Help bring the Fat Kid to Columbus!

Reserve tickets here: http://www.tugg.com/events/879#.T-zLAtQlAXE


Tickets are $10. If the event were to be cancelled due to not reaching the goal, money will be refunded.

I created a public event on Facebook so if you're going, feel free to RSVP and invite friends.

In honor of our daughter Violet, My fiancee's sister has organized a memorial event in Willoughby on October 15th, Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness Day. This will be the first one in Willoughby so we are trying to reach as many people as we can.  Anyone who has lost a baby whether by miscarriage, stillbirth, or infant loss is welcome to come.

If you don't live in that area, you can still you can still go to [the website](http://violetslight.blogspot.com/) or [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Violets-Light/114737735297116) and contact my sister in law if you would like your baby's name to be read during the event.  She is trying to do a lot to help people who have suffered a loss like ours.

thank you for your time :)

The schemer, mastermind, and talking head for Republicans that always creeps amongst the woodwork for the right-wing. As the post title reads he's coming to my town of Niles, Ohio and it's all I can do not to vomit at the thought of him being in my town peddling his book on ""bravery."" This is a guy that doesn't know shit about courage, obviously, and somehow he has managed to get invited here. So here is my plan.....

I live in a town with less than 20,000 people in it. Niles isn't an activist city by any means so if I can muster up a sizable group of people to give Rove a coward's welcome it'd really get alot of attention. And in a Rustbelt place like this that suffered from the Bush administration a statement has to be made for this war-monger. These days it kind of feels like many have forgotten about how lousy the Cheney/Bush dynasty and their lackeys were so if I can anything for my anti-war motivations I'll say this: they need to be called out for the tyrants they are. And that is exactly what will happen on Feb. 22nd. 

So I'll keep this simple and cut to the chase: 

* Karl Rove is coming to my town of Niles, Ohio on February 22 2011
* I am holding an anti-war protest to answer Rove's presence here
*  Bigger crowd = more noise - get in on this and show Rove that his contributions to the wars America is now trapped in have not been forgotten

So that's it. I've made a [website](rovesucks.wordpress.com) to organize the event so get more info there if you're curious. 

If **any** political figure came to my town championing their approval of America's most recent wars I'd be doing this. So this has nothing to do with the Dem/Repub binary and everything to do with asking proponents of war one question: Why aren't you over there?

tl;dr - Karl Rove is coming to my town and he's getting a non-violent protest done on him. And this **definitely** will be a night to remember. It's been a long time coming and the anti-war cause needs to be reawakened. Join us!

Lived in Ohio most of my life, but went to school out-of-state for a few years, so my other friends are an hour away in my home town. I'll be starting school at WSU in the fall, but that's a few months off, and I'd really like to meet some people!

I dunno how many people actually read this and are in the area, but I'd love to meet up with some fellow redditors, even if it's just grabbing some pizza and drinks or going bowling. I live in Kettering, basically just a stone's throw from the Oregon District, so that's always an option if anyone is interested.

But also does anyone have any suggestions for places to just go and hang out? The bar scene seems like it'd be hard to meet many people, but I've only gone on the weekends, aside from Therapy Cafe which is pretty chill.
If anyone is interested in a small gathering, let me know! Even if it's just a small group of 3-4 people, I'm sure it could be a lot of fun.

edit: I might make a Facebook event or something for this, since apparently making a meetup.com group costs a lot of money.  It might be easier to keep up on than through a reddit thread.  I can PM my facebook and/or e-mail to anyone that wants to try and keep things organized that way.
