1367300453.0,44,self.Magicdeckbuilding,1de85p,[Standard] Mono-Green. Went 5-0 and won FNM! (Yes with a mono green deck),Aroh,46,2,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/Magicdeckbuilding/comments/1de85p/standard_monogreen_went_50_and_won_fnm_yes_with_a/,"I know we have somewhat been seeing more attempts at mono-green lately, and even Melissa Detora made her own version of it recently (here:http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=11065). Having said, that I'm kind of the green fanatic among my friends and feel like I had finally a really good mono-green deck, one that can go up against almost any other of the multicolour decks. I believe I have created it. 

http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/mono-green-10-01-13-1/

Let me explain how FNM ended up going:

Match 1: I won in two against a Rakdos/Falkenrath deck. Didn't really ever give me trouble throughout the two games. In the first game I got CHampion of Lambholt on turn 2 and then an Increasing Savagery and it was over. Second game I got an Ooze out early with a rancor and again it was over.

Match 2: This was surprisingly more difficult than anticipated as it went to 3 games. It was against a younger player (possibly 12 or so) and he was playing a Black/Green deck with Desecration Demon. Unfortunately for him, Undying and Champion of Lambholt works wonders against Desecration Demon. The game I lost he top decked a mutilate which won him the game as his Demon was huge and I had a bunch of 3/4 toughness creatures. All in all though he just didn't have enough firepower.

Game 3: Won in 3. This is when things began to get intense and REAL. Played against an American deck. Honestly I wasn't feeling too confident going into this match, and it showed in the first game when he got Aurelia out and I had nothing. He had three azorious charms and two cyclonic rifts which really kill all the counter heavy creatures. Second game though I got an Ooze out with a Alpha Authority and it was over at that point. He was able to stall for a bit but eventually with a rancor won it. Third game I aggrod him hard with three Geists on turn 3 overall and not much he could do. He was pretty shocked.

Match 4: Against Reanimator Won in 3. This guy I was playing was quite confident. He explained that I would be able to win game 1 but after sideboard no way I could win game 2 and 3. Little did he know about Alpha Authority (like he honestly had no idea I ran it). First game I got him down to 1 health but then he stabilized and I lost. Second game was really insane and will never happen again. But in my opening hand I had an alpha authority, arbor elf, three forests, increasing savagery and rancor. I decided to keep. On turn 3 I ended up alpha authority on arbor elf and a rancor and figured Im going to go all in with the Arbor elf. I eventually pulled another Increasing Savagery and by something like turn 7 I had a 22/20 Hexproof, Trample Arbor Elf (remember flashback on that spell), game over. In game 3, I eventually got a alpha authority on a Champion and a bunch of other creatures. The game got really close but I ended up lasting long enough to put an increasing savagery on Champion and then swung with like 7 creatures for the win. The guy was extremely rattled and annoyed by Alpha Authority and just couldn't believe he lost.

Match 5: Won in 2. Not sure the name of the deck type but it was the classic Thrag/Resto/Angel of Serenity trio that I just love! First game I got an Ooze and then the turn after I put an alpha authority on it he summoned an Angel of Serenity. I had already done half damage by the time he summoned it though and the Ooze was able to finish him off before he could kill me with the Angel. The second game was much like the 3rd game in Match 4, except no Alpha Authority. I simply got the Champion out and a bunch of other creatures. The first couple turns though I only attacked with the other creatures and not the Champ (she was a 4/4 maybe) and I made the right call as he used two azorious charms right after. Then eventually she was big enough and I swung for the win when he tapped out.

Overall it was a super fun night and nobody could believe that I had won with the deck. The staff at the LGS asked if they could see my deck and see how much it cost online. They deduced it cost around 60 dollars, so in essence, 1 dollar a card. I felt really proud of it and implore everyone to try and make there own decks with what they are passionate about.

""But Imponaut, it's so expensive! Imponaut, it doesn't do anything when it comes into play!""

And those two things are almost completely correct. 

First, it is 6 mana. But we've got some cool tricks available to hit that faster. Arbor Elf, Deathrite Shaman, and even the new Zhur-Taa Druid to help us get there. And good old Farseek if you want to go three color. (hint, you do.)

Second, it hits the board and you bin the top ten of your library. That's it, just chuck 'em in there. While that might not seem so great for an ETB ability, it kicks off the engine Golgari stlyle. Now we've got at least ten cards in our graveyard, and starting the following turn we get *something* back. Could be a land, could be a spell, it could even be a creature right back into play. I think it's pretty neat.

&gt;""But Imponaut, it's RAAAAAAANDOOOOOOOM!""

Quit whining, your saying that like it's a bad thing. Your opponent can see what you have (potential) access to, but can't plan on any one card. And since you're running B/G/x, you'll have access to a number of ways to control how many (or few) cards you want in your graveyard. 

As far as sculpting your graveyard you've got Memory's Journey in BUG or Harvest Pyre in Jund colors. Serene Remembrance, Deathrite Shaman, and Cremate all come to mind in just BG, so they'll fit in either side. Toss in something like Mulch to make sure you're hitting your land drops, and you've got the trappings of something potent. 

As far as recursion targets go, there are a few that stand out as far as I'm concerned. Anything that's a ""must kill"" like Garruk, Primal Hunter or Thragtusk would work well I think. Spells like Putrefy or Dissipate are not things I'd want an opponent to have a 2nd, 3rd, or 5th crack at.

I apologize in advance for the wall of text and English is not my first language so sorry about that.

When I was in high-school I used to play MTG every day but as I got older my friends stop playing and eventually so did I. Now that I'm older and have a bit of cash I decided that I am gonna build 5 house decks (one of each colour). What do I mean by house deck? its simple just decks that I can play with my house guests.



**Ok here are the parameters:**

1) They have to be balanced. This very important!! Take note I understand that some decks will counter others but one cannot be stronger/weaker than all the other decks.

2)They have to be tribal decks(elves, goblin, humans...). What can I say i love tribes!

3)Most importantly they have to be fun to play with/against. If a deck is really good I have found that it can kill a player under 5 turns i don't want this.

4)Not to weak but not to strong. Partly because of managing rule 1 and 3 I should build them a bit weaker but if they are to weak that's also no fun.

5)[Not to put nine cards in.](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/magic-the-classroom-the-rule-of-nine/) For the sake of diversity I will only add 2 of each card except for 2 creatures that will have 4 in (I will call these my core creatures), I think this makes the decks fun and a bit unpredictable (This may affect rule 1).  

6)60 card decks with no side board.




**here are the tribes**

Blue Wizards: This will be a control deck to lock down your enemy and slowly chip away at him

Black Zombie deck: Death plain and simple. Kill your enemies creatures and overrun him.

Green Elves: Swarm and Overrun.

White Soldier: Call to arms, build a strong army and overrun.

Red Goblins : Hit fast hit hard.

I actually don't like the Goblins (It feels like I'm Six pooling like a noob) Is there any other Red tribes that has more of a burn element? And the elves are cool but I would like a power house green tribe any ideas?



**Ok and finally we get to the basic template I am going to use for each deck.**
 
a total of 22 Lands : 18 basic lands  and 4 special lands

a total of 8 Instants/Sorcery:  of which there will be 4 (two of each)

a total of 4 Enchantments: of which there will be two.

a total of 28 creatures: 8 of which will be my two core creatures and the rest will be 10 creatures of which there will be two of each.

What do you guys think? any advice? Do you have other recommendations for tribes? Is my mana to creature ratio ok?

**Thanks** in advance
I will update when I start building the first deck Thanks.

EDIT:
One of my concerns with this deck is that the win condition is kind of a shotgun approach. If I get big voices elemental tokens OR a bunch of wurms populated OR a bunch of lifegain from Trostani OR a ton of +1/+1 counters from Mikaeus, then I have a good chance to win the game. But with so many avenues to victory I'm having trouble decided when to keep a hand and when to mulligan. Even with 24 lands and the mana-dorks I can feel mana-light in a lot of game and I feel a noose around my neck if I can't make a turn-three or turn-four land drop. 

So the primary focus of help I'm looking for is whether I should adjust my mana curve or mana base. Or both. Or neither, and just learn what a good opening hand looks like.

This week we'll be talking about [U/G Self Mill](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/march-30th-budget).

UG self mill is a powerful draft archetype for Innistrad, and since many of the core pieces are easy enough to come by in draft, it makes it a good choice for a budget deck.  The core idea is to mill yourself fairly quickly with cheap enablers and put things into your graveyard through [looting](http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=245299) or draw/pick effects, and then end the game with cards that benefit from having high creatures counts in your graveyard.

Our mana base is somewhat shaky on two colors, and with our preference to high creature counts we have to do our best to keep our land count very low.  Since we have a higher density of green cards, especially at the 1/2 drop spot, it is very important we have access to green mana in our opening hand, so 11 Forests should make that happen every game.  Islands for our mostly 3 drop centric blue needs.  Splashing 1 swamp for flashback. Since we can't afford dual lands and we need to make sure we have 2-3 colors on demand, we need to tutor them up with [Evolving wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=262680), this gives us 4 cards we could draw to get us a swamp or any other mana fixing we need. We want to get our lands early and really don't want them later, evolving wilds also filters some of the lands out of our deck making it more likely for us to draw the action we need or mill creatures when we need to.  

We need to have a good start to our game, if we don't, we don't have a lot of ways to stabalize later.  So to keep our lands low and creatures high we need some mana-dorks, [Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=221892) is perfect for us.  Extra creatures to put in the yard when we don't need it, and accelerating our mana to help us get ahead.  [Viridian Emissary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=213728) is another elf to help us out.  He helps us agro/stall, and uppon death fixes our mana and filters our deck.  

Our big ticket item in this deck is another mana dork, [Birds of paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=221896).  Birds helps us get off to a good start, and fixes our mana for us, even with our lower density of other color lands BoP helps us stay on or ahead of the curve.  Just like our Elves we don't feel to bad about sending these to our graveyard since they become more fuel for our big win conditions.

[Mulch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=237012) is our last bit of mana fixing.  It both enables our self mill and puts mana in our hand.  While mostly an early mana fixing card setting up our curve, with a looter out it also serves for good card advantage to just loot away each of our excess lands.

We have a few looters for hand correction and graveyard fuel.  [Merfolk Looter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=220179) helps us out by both helping us fix our hand and filling our graveyard with everything we don't need.  [Civilized Scholar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=221209) is another looter, but when we need to this looter turns into a 5 power beater.  We need to put a lot of cards in our graveyard, and these two really help us see a lot of cards and put them where we want them.

We also have our draw/loot with [Forbidden Alchemy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=226758), this lets us see a lot of cards and find what we need, while putting a good amount of cards into our yard at the same time.  [Armored Skaab](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=244685) is our last enabler, the blind mill is usually sub-optimal but we really need that yard full, and his high toughness helps stall the board out until we can get some win-cons down.

After we've filled up our graveyard our win-cons come down and usually win very quickly.  [Boneyard Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=220050) is a potentially very big beater, but without trample it'll just get chumped all day long, either way it's still a big body that helps us win. [Ghoultree](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=262662) can also work in this place of ""big beater for cheap""; it can't grow as large as boneyard wurm could, but the static stats makes it more resilient against graveyard hate and can potentially hit play sooner.  [Splinterfright](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=227301) is both a beater and an enabler, and with trample he can't be chumped, just be careful from the uncontrollable self mill you don't mill yourself to death.

[Kessig Cagebreakers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=249868) with sufficient creatures in your graveyard just wins games instantly.  Unfortunatly Cagebreakers also has to attack, that means waiting to untap.  Against a control matchup with lots of spot removal you also have the option of [Postmortem Lunge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=233054) to send a graveyarded cagebreaker in attacking bringing all his wolf friends along as well.  [Spider Spawning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=222175) is another overwhelm token spawner; while they spiders aren't as powerful as the wolves they do have reach allowing you to deal with flyers, and the flashback allows you to cast it twice or even if you mill it.

[Skaab Ruinator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=230780) is a controversial card in Self Mill decks.  To play the skaab you need to remove creatures from your graveyard, and creatures in your graveyard is the fuel for the rest of your win conditions.  I like having the skaab around for ""just in case"".  You want to have this guy in your yard, even if you don't ever play it, it's still a creature in your yard.  If you *really* need a creature out to deal with something, or just need another body to swing in when you're out of gas, casting the Ruinator from your graveyard is a plenty good fallback plan.

This deck is definitly not in optimal form, even after extensive testing I'm not sure it's quite right yet, but the core ideas are there, and it's pretty functional.  You need a good start, you've got plenty of hand correction down the road, so knowing when to mulligan is very important.

Magic: the Gathering is all about casting spells (unless you're dredge, but they're not people) and doing stuff with them. To cast those spells, you need mana. Something I see with almost every newcomer's deck is a 50/50 split on land colors. Most of the time, the deck is not even close to 50/50 on mana costs, so it ends up looking sort of like [this](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/bloody-demons-1/).  

The problem with this is that with half our mana being used to pay for 1/4 of our spells, we're short-changing ourselves on 3/4 of our deck for correctly-colored mana. Losing to mana-screw when you're drawing lands consistently sucks.

There are a couple ways to make sure your color-balance is where it should be. I'm lazy, so I tend to use the pie-charts found in tappedout. Try to line up the inner circle (your land colors) with the outer circle (your deck's mana cost colors) by adding and removing lands. It doesn't have to be perfect, something like [this](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/rb-aggro-28-12-12-1/) will usually do just fine. The key is that you don't want to have twice as many Swamps as you need and only 2/3 as many Mountains.

If you don't have access to a deckbuilding page (like, if you're at a draft or just building at LGS), you can separate your cards into piles by color. Count the number of cards in each pile, and divide those numbers by 2. This gives you a decent estimate of how many lands of each color you need (I believe you count multicolored cards once for EACH color they contain). If you end up with a total less than about 22, adding more lands is advised. Just try to keep the ratio you ended up with.

**EDIT** Props to the following:

Good comment provided by [Imponaut](http://www.reddit.com/r/Magicdeckbuilding/comments/16b93n/suggestion_psa_for_new_deckbuilders/c7ufm28) outlines another way to determine your mana-balance, and emphasizes importance of testing.

 [Brocker83](http://www.reddit.com/r/Magicdeckbuilding/comments/16b93n/suggestion_psa_for_new_deckbuilders/c7uid3n) mentions spending the money to get dual lands for your mana base. This is another thing that people will try to sneak around for budget building, but the fact of the matter is your deck will never reach its full potential without good mana sources. The lands will always be useful for you as long as you play this game, and the shocks will be valid for the next year and a half to 2 years at least in standard. They're pretty much good forever in Modern.

I don't have an exact deck list, but I'll give you the gist.

We like to call it 'Controlled Burn.' R/U: Red is Lightning Bolt for early threats, Mizzium Mortars for late-game overload clean up. Kiln Fiends get pumped up with 2-3 instants a turn for insane early damage. Blue is many things; primarily Brainstorms and Ponders to cycle through his deck quickly while pumping up Kiln Fiends to dangerous levels. Cyclonic Rift to handle early creatures or wipe the board later when overloaded. He has spells to tap my creatures, as well as a playset of Control Magic (and a Bribery) to steal the creatures big enough to survive the burn. He has an Izzet wizard that makes his spells cheaper, and a Niv-Mizzet the Firemind for the late-game.

I've tried many decks, overrun elves, Rack discard, slivers, but his deck is on a completely different level. My deckbuilding is not bad, I've won ~70% of the games we've played in the past 11 years, but I'm just not cracking the code on this one. What kind of deck should perform well against something like this? He doesn't have counter, so maybe a combo deck? Should I go white and lock him down with some color-hate? Anything casual will work, though we basically play Vintage minus P9 and anything over $100.

Yesterday I went to a (slightly less hardcore than FNM) weekly standard tournament with my homebrew Izzet counter/burn deck. It was bad, like: 0-4-0 bad. I really like the R/U playstyle, and I want it to work but it just isn't winning.


First game I went up against a Nico Christiansen Naya Humans, and well, there's not much to say about that... but the second round stood out in it's ~~sexy~~ blitziness: T1 Cavern, Champion - T2 Temple Garden, Champion, Boros Elite - T3 Sunpetal Grove, Burning Tree Emissary into Burning Tree Emissary into Mayor of Avabruck. My single Augur posted his letter of resignation... 0-2


Second game was really fun actually, it started with us rolling 2 D6 for draw/play and we got the same number three goddamn times in a row, then I found out he was playing UWR control and what followed was a thirty minute long (literally) counterspell war. Which he (obviously) won by racing my 2 Augurs with a Resto Angel. Second round was a draw. 0-3-1


Third game was against a UB control semimill + Aberrations, Desecration Demons and Jace's Phantasm. First round I tapped out for a guttersnipe and couldn't counter his Demon :( Second round he same scenario but with a consuming Aberration and later Gift of Orzhova. Swing for 19 Flying Lifelink. 0-5-1


Fourth Game was basically the only close one, I played against a BG x creatures in your graveyard deck with mulch, trackers, grisly. First round I countered his 10/10 costs 1 less for each card in your gy only for him to play 2 boneyard wurms turn after. Second round I won turn 4 with T1 Delver, T2 Searing Spear + Flipped Delver, T3 Guttersnipe, T4 Pillar of Flame, Searing Spear and swing for the win. Third round I get screwed and stomped. 1-7-1


I didn't expect to do well, but 1-7-1 ganes and zero wins what so ever was even worse than I thought. But you can't always win, I guess, but now I want to focus on improving the deck.


-3 Electromancer nah


+1 Guttersnipe he's aight


+2 Delver just too good on turn 1


-1 Talrand I got to play him twice and he always got killed before he could trigger


+1 Think Twice


I'm not so sure about the Augur's, they're good road blocks, but it feels like I need so much more damage output. If I take out 2 of them, what would I put in? I never got to play the epic experiment and I will not take it out until I have :D


I'd love some input from you seasoned players (I've been playing for ~1.5 months) Thanks in advance deckbuilders!

Ok, so I'm trying my hands at making a [blue combo deck](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/hightides-combo/) while trying to add some of my own flair to it. It uses high tides + several cards that untap lands for vast amounts of mana, I'm easily able to get Cloud Of Faeries out with Dead Eye Navigator on third turn granting me infinite mana. It runs Steam vents because I cant afford volcanic islands, and four is just right when I only run one or two epic experiments, my alternative to minds desire.

Seems like i forgot to add the deck I already have. My fault! Sorry! 
The deck I already have put together.
[Scavenge/defender](http://mtgvault.com/ghepip/decks/scavenge-defender/)

It's mainly a scavenge deck, but I kept running out of creatures and mana, so I added the Axebane Guardian and some defenders and that made the trick. Now I just want it to be better at what it does. 

I been thinking about adding Morbid cards to my deck. I already ordered 4 tragic slip.

And I'm also going to order: [Golgari Deathcreep](http://www.kelz0r.dk/magic/ravnica-theme-deck-golgari-deathcreep-p-19011.html?stat=1)

I don't play enough to know a whole lot about the meta game, but I have a decent grasp of the cards and like deck building.  What could make it more useful for me to help, would be for people to explicitly ask for what they want.

This does happen occasionally, but I'd like even more specifics.  If you want sideboard advice (I'm guilty of this generic question), instead ask for advice on sideboards for specific decks, or ask whether specific cards would be good against specific threats.  Asking for advice on evening out a mana curve, or the number of lands is more useful that asking how to make a deck better.

The main problem is that we've never seen your deck before.  We don't know how it plays or how you want it to play.  I can't try to help fix something if I don't know what is wrong in the first place.  I'd like this subreddit to be a more constructive place since it's often pointed out that decks are posted here and then completely ignored.

Red Deck Wins is a mono red agro/burn deck.  It recently took 1st in a Star City Games open tournament.  [Here's a Decklist](http://sales.starcitygames.com//deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=44072), and [another version](http://sales.starcitygames.com//deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=43175).

Red Deck Wins relies on being a very fast and powerful deck right out of the gate, with cheap and aggressive creatures and cost efficient and versatile burn spells the only goal is to get your opponents life total to 0 before yours through turning creatures sideways or the red fallback option of ""to the dome"".

**Lands** 

As a mono colored deck, the only basic land is a mountain.  And with such a shallow mana curve the deck can run as low as 20 lands, and will rarely run above 23.  The version that won SCGO Charlotte was more top heavy and ran 23 with 2 copies of [Kessig Wolf Run](http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=233256) for additional late threats.  The version from Los Angeles was more early game focused and only ran 21 lands.  Both Decks ran 4 copies of [Rootbound Crag](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=221922) to give access to some green mana, and with the high density of mountains in each deck it is a rare occurrence that they will not have access to a mountain.

**1 Mana Creatures**

Being an agressive deck you will *need* a good turn 1 drop. 

[Stromkirk Noble](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=230783) is a great choice.  It has evasion against humans, that means most other turn 1 play in standard, W humans and U Delver are unable to do anything against this vampire nobility.

Each of your other 1 drops are a little less agressive than your Noble, but each has a great ability for direct damage.  And being a turn 1 1/1 body can be very useful for turning on turn 2 *bloodthirst*.

[Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=234428) is conditional [shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=245184) on a stick.  As the game goes later, the creature and spells you dump into your graveyard become kindling for him to use against your opponent.  [Spikeshot Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=209404) is a mana dump for damage, any time you have an extra 3 mana laying about at the end of turn dump it into Spikeshot Elder for 1 damage wherever.  It is tied to his Power so attaching with battle-cry and then using his ability for 2 damage is a great way to squeeze in a little more damage.  It isn't a tap ability, so feel free to use it whenever you feel like as long as you have the mana available.

**1 Mana Spells**

[Gut Shot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=230074) while technically a 1 mana spell will almost always be a pay 2 life spell.  Almost no other deck will be able to out-race you, so your life total is just another resource for fueling your burn spells.  This is a great card for killing X/1 creatures, (mana dorks, unflipped delvers, any other 1 toughness blocker).  As a fallback to turn on *Bloodthirst* you can pay 2 life first for 1 directly at your opponent.

[Galvanic Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=208251), a strictly better version of Shock, while you will rarely have metalcraft with only 4-5 artifacts in your entire deck, why turn down the option for extra free damage when the situation arises?

**2 Mana Creatures**

[Stormblood Berserker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=220277) is a wonderful little human.  Turn on bloodthirst and he's a 3/3 on turn 2.  And unless your opponent is willing to throw at least 2 creatures in frost of this axe wielding human he's unblockable.  

**2 Mana Spells**

[Arc Trail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=206343) is a nifty little spell.  Kill two creatures, kill a creature and put the leftover on an opponent, whatever you need it to do, it's there to spread some pain.

[Incinerate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=234075) is a standard burn spell.  It's no [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=234704) but in decks desparate for more burn it isn't a bad choice.

[Ancient Grudge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=235600) is your artifact hate spell, strictly better than [Shatter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=194147) because with access to green you get to flashback the spell for only 1 mana, and against the prevalence of Swords floating around standard the ability to kill another one for cheap is invaluable.

**2 Mana Artifacts**

[Shrine of Burning Rage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=218018) is your late game answer, and potentially the biggest threat in this deck.  Every turn you add 1 counter, and with every spell you get another counter, that's a buildup of (on average) 2 damage a turn whenever you're ready to crack the shrine.  Against a control matchup this is an invaluable card, and in any other aggressive matchup it's your trump card once the board has stabilized.

**3 Mana Creatures**

[Chandra's Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=220298) is a big threat for you.  A 2/2 hasted flyer is already good.  You trade with Delver, kill Spirit Tokens, and just fly on past lots of other things straight to their life.  But it has the added ability of returning to your hand if you hit them with a burn spell, and with your high density of burn spells and reliance on them once your have a suitable board presence you'll be seeing this card over and over and over again.

**3 Mana Spells**

[Volt Charge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=214381) is an awesome card for your deck.  It's Incinerate damage, but Prolifferate is an awesome bonus.  Turn 1 Stromkirk, Turn 2 Stromkir deals damage to get a +1/+1 counter - Play Stormblood Berserker entering with 2 +1/+1 counters, Turn 3 both Stromkirk and Stormblood Attack.  As they attack you cast Volt Charge for 3 damage wherever you need it (to a creature or to their life) and proliferate the +1/+1 counters on Stromkirk (up to a 3/3) and Stormblood (up to a 4/4), you now have 10 damage on board coming in at your opponent.  That's potentially half of their life in 1 turn.

[Brimstone Volley](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=233253) is another incinerate with bonuses.  If you have *morbid* up (which is very likely with how agressive your creatures are) then you have 5 damage for 3 mana ready to go.

**3 Mana Artifacts**

[Sword of War and Peace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=214368).  What deck isn't made better with this?  evasion in the mirror matchup or agressive White decks.  And it helps you burn your oponent down, it's just a handy-dandy piece of equipment.

[Hero of Oxid Ridge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=214028) is your big finisher.  Battle Cry to buff your dudes, and 4 damage ready to come in, and any 1 toughness creatures can't block, so that means no cump blocks coming out.  that's a lot of damage on board coming at your opponent.

**4 Mana Planeswalkers**

[Koth of the Hammer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=212238) is your buddy here.  Not only do you get a 4/4 every turn to beat with, if his ult goes off you get re-usable fireball with each mountain.  And his ability to untap all of your mountains is nothing to shake a stick at either, if you just need to power out that Kessig Wolf Run pump, or a second burn spell Koth has your back.

That's the Maindeck.  Start turning your creatures sideways and tapping lands for direct damage.  And let the discussion on Red Deck Wins start.",,False,,t5_2sv87,False,,,True,t3_q4a1h,http://www.reddit.com/r/Magicdeckbuilding/comments/q4a1h/deck_tech_friday_february_24th/,

But if you're expecting to do well when you go to a FNM at your local comic books store, or a pro-tour qualifier, don't run these colors, and if you want to do well then splash a 3rd.

I have been playtesting my [R/W deck](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/c3h7cooh-rw-deck-copy/?category=type&amp;submit=Go%21) for about 2 months now, gearing up for a protour qualifier in April, and all I have to say...Is I wasted way to much money, trying to get a deck to work, that simply can't.  Here is why.  R/G Gruul ramps faster than you, their ability to play BTE, into a Mayor (if they are human naya), or a Flinthoof-boar, or a lighting mauler, and thens swing for anywhere between 5-8 (maybe first card was a Champion of the Parish).  is a lot of damage to take on turn 2, it gets faster, and before they finally stablize, you can be assured they will have played a thragtusk, or a Huntmaster of the Fells, and have a decent amount of life cushion over you, along with a larger creature presence (tokens too).  Sure you can run more removal, but now you are no longer an aggro deck are you?  You've moved into midrange, but I'm not telling you not to go Boros Midrange, the post is don't go boros aggro.

Another thing that is working against you is assuming you can play Battalion.  Which assumes that now only can you get 3 creatures out on the field, but that they are going to let you swing with all 3, without having the chance to do some sort of removal prior to that.  Since most boros decks run humans, and most humans are 1/1 or 2/1, even something as low cost as a tragic slip will ruin any plans you may have had.

White is all about protection, and healing.  Most that are asking for advice on boros decks, aren't taking advantage of either of these mechanics, so really what's the point? Also while I love the mechanic of the silverblade paladin, and frontline medics, the 3 cost makes them difficult to play without having someone remove them.  So again you can run cards to protect them, but then you start inching yourself out of aggro, and into midrange.

If you want to run aggro, and R/W is a MUST, then either put green in their so you can have the benifit of their ramp (which is why naya is doing so well right now).  Or run some black for the benifit of cheap removal, and cards which more useful mechanics than battalion.

P.S.  If you are going to ask for advice on your aggro deck, and you are still running guildgates over the proper dual lands, and shocklands, fix your mana first.  It's an expensive upgrade to be sure, but waiting a turn to play a card, only puts you further and further behind.",,False,,t5_2sv87,False,,,True,t3_1a81a7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Magicdeckbuilding/comments/1a81a7/standardboros_rw_aggro_stop_trying_to_build_a/,

This is my decklist: http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/gruul-aggro-11-03-13-7/

I really enjoy this deck; however, my city's metagame has no shortage of aggro. I keep finding myself unable to win easily against aggro that is slower than mine (read: has 4-drops) or Naya Blitz, since racing a Silverblade Paladin is nigh impossible. I absolutely destroy midrange on a regular basis, but dealing with of Naya Blitz, Selesnya Humans, Boros Aggro, and RDW is becoming frustrating.

As odd as it sounds, I'm honestly thinking about sideboarding 4 muggings just to deal with Silverblades and Champion of the Parish a little easier, since I'll have no shortage of burn in that situation.

Boros Reckoners don't really help me in a racing situation, but I can't think of many good red 3-drops. Sure, it's nice to have a Reckoner on turn 3, but they don't quite fit in a lightning-fast deck like this. They are, however, stupidly good anyways. Would mainboarding Pyreheart Wolves in place of them be a good idea for my meta?

Need sideboard help/suggestions to help aggro matchups.,crd319,11,0,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Magicdeckbuilding/comments/199gss/standard_esper_spirits_need_sideboard/,"Link: http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/esper-spirits-25-02-13-5/

So the last couple weeks, I've been piloting an Esper Spirit deck with a significant level of success at my local meta.  The deck focuses on several paths to victory: Geist of St Traft and continual spot removal for blockers, Spirit Token Beatdowns, and Obzedat who just wins games.

It plays sort of midrange-y/control-ish, using lots of cards to keep my opponent from making profitable blocks and killing troublesome creatures.  I can walk through mill and control decks all day.  If I go Cavern of Souls into GoST, most control decks simply scoop.  My deck, however, has a serious issue with aggro decks.  They can often get under me before I can draw anything to stabilize (I main boarded the Verdicts and Blind Obediances last night specifically to deal with aggro).

I'm just not sure what else I should do to deal with aggro without moving my deck too far from its current play state.  The side board probably needs some work too.  

Curse of Echoes, Dispel, Syncopate, Dissipate are included for control decks but often I don't use them as my main board doesn't have much of a problem with those decks.  I'd still want to keep curse and dispel for decks running Sphinx's Revelation.

D-Sphere is for token decks and for Planeswalkers.

Feeling of Dread, Murder, Supreme Verdict, Devour Flesh are more spot removal for creature heavy decks that give mine issues.  Murder is there basically to take the place of Ultimate Price for Boros Reconers or other troublesome multicolored creatures.

Vampire Nighthawks were an addition I made last night after going 2-2 at MNM, losing to aggro.  My thinking is the deathtouch and lifelink can slow down aggro just a little bit, hopefully giving me time to draw a wrath or an obzedat.

Any help would be appreciated.  This deck is so much fun to play and is just on the cusp of being awesome.  Just needs some help against faster decks.",,False,,t5_2sv87,False,,,True,t3_199gss,http://www.reddit.com/r/Magicdeckbuilding/comments/199gss/standard_esper_spirits_need_sideboard/,

cents)",grensley,11,2,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Magicdeckbuilding/comments/1321a3/quietly_budget_3_mono_blue_hyper_aggro_for_69/,"http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/deck.asp?deck_id=1067407

Alright.  So here's the story.  Last week, I played a deck that looks a lot like the one above, and my stock Esper Control list got run over by it in two straight games.  Now, as you may have noticed, literally all of the money in this deck is in the three Snapcasters (which to be honest, is pretty mediocre in this deck, I'm still trying to figure out the right number of them, the original deck I played against had none).  It's worth noting that Snapcaster is only 7.5 tickets on MODO, and this is directly following its winning a tournament as a 4-of, it was 6 last week.

So I decided to build the deck.  I went hunting for a list!

...

...

Nowhere.  Apparently this budget guy I played on MODO is the only person playing this deck.  I already had the Snapcasters and Delvers, so I went out and spent the best spent one ticket of my life to pick a pile of 'U' costing jank.

That jank fits into this deck well.  Each spell has so much versatility.  Many cantrip, or at least give you time or tempo.  Artful Dodge and Blustersquall are great finishers for this deck, and Thought Scour, Unsummon, and Mizzium Skin all do important things.

I fully expected to get my ass handed to me.  But I didn't.  I haven't run it through a daily yet, but this deck wins.  I talked with the original pilot when I first played him, and I joked that the deck, while awesome, seemed like a bit of a glass cannon.  And it is, but this can be mitigated with some smart play.

The key to playing this deck is simple: Take risks, but don't let your creatures die.  Know what answers yor opponents have. Imagine you are your opponent.  Dominate the control of information.  BOUNCE YOUR OWN DUDES.  Your own flipped Delvers.  Your own powered up Nivmagi.  You need them, and if you can protect them well, there are few things that will be able to block them.  

KNOW HOW ALL THE INTERACTION WORK.  Study the list.  You can Dispel your own spells, then exile the Dispel with Nivmagus, and still have the spell resolver if you want.  You can play Artful Dodge, then flash it back and exile it when you flash it back.  Unsummon your Snapcasters in preperation of flashing back Mizzium Skin if removal is their only out.

This deck is ALWAYS THE BEATDOWN.  You are the beatdown against monored.  You are the beatdown against zombies.  

This deck has some incredibly disgusting matchups, as well as some decks it just cannot beat.  Luckily the decks you can't beat are decks like: Grixis Control, and any deck running hand disruption, and the decks you can beat every time are: decks that run creatures.

Well not every time, but it feels like they are playing a silly game.  That's enough ranting from me, go have some fun.

PS You maintain priority as long as you have a Nivmagus on the field in MODO automatically.  Nice touch Wizards, not making me hold down control all game.

This is an obvious attempt at extreme budget, since I'm not even including the Dragonskull Summits that make this deck just better.

So, what the hell is this deck?  Well, this deck is a lesson in math.  

The basic game plan is to live long enough to cast Havoc Festival, let the trigger halve their life on their upkeep(usually they go to 10), live through their attacks back.  Untap, Get hit with Havoc Festival yourself (Which shouldn't matter, because as long as you aren't a 1 life you don't die).  Pass.  Then after Havoc Festival triggers during their turn (they go to 5, and it's before they draw) cast an instant that does 5 to the face for the kill.

The living long enough is the tricky part.  Mostly this is achieved with the indiscrimate killing of creatures.  Tribute to Hunger is a real hero in this deck, dealing with threats and buying you time.  Rakdos Keyrune does a great job ramping and protecting you.  Barter in Blood might as well be Damnation with how few other things live.

I've found this deck to be very good against Midrange decks, which comprise much of the format.  Also there is zero instant speed enchantment hate running around.

It's not the best deck ever, but if you are looking for a dirt cheap new deck to try out, this is a fun one.  Plus you get to beat people with Havoc Festival, a card I haven't heard one person say a good thing about.",,False,,t5_2sv87,False,,,True,t3_11opsc,http://www.reddit.com/r/Magicdeckbuilding/comments/11opsc/standard_quietly_budget_2_havoc_festival_for_4/,

I don't like to skimp on card quality however, so I am constantly in search of cards I know to be excellent, but cheap.

And right now, Nicol Bolas is cheap.  This card has been $13 for much of its printed life.  It dropped an $8 price when M13 came out.  Now you can get them for about $3.

So on to the deck:

http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/deck.asp?deck_id=1057824

Now the plan here is to gain control of the game, then chip away at the opponent with Keyrunes/Burn them out.  To get to this stage in the game we're playing a lot of spot removal, especially in the form of exile: Pillar of Flame and Sever the Bloodline.  These cards do a good job of dealing with the many undying/recursion/value creatures in the format.

Curse of Death's Hold seems particularly good at locking decks like zombies out of the game as it just stops Blood Artist Gravecrawler and Falkenrath Aristocrat.

One of the nice perks of this deck is invulverability to most removal.  Yes Demonic Taskmaster will probably just each a removal spell.  Still not completely sure about him.  But he's such an undercosted beater, that if he does stick around, he can end the game in a hurry in conjuction with some burn.  Still, he's resistant to Pillar of Flames, which is the most played removal spell in the format right now.

What this deck is missing most is a good source of lifegain.  Tribute is fairly good at doing its job (gaining life and killing Geist of St Traft) because it has so much help from other removal, but this deck really wants Pristine Talisman back.

One of the the other things I really like about this deck is that it gives you a bunch of quality utility cards for the price you are paying.  You get 2 playsets of Dual Lands, a nice amount of quality removal, some cards you might have wanted for Commander, and 2 Planeswalkers for your investment.

Improvements for the deck mostly involve fixing the manabase, probably 1 Tamiyo and 1-2 Jace, Architect of Thoughts.  I think the addition of another Rakdos Keyrune would be necessary if the metagame does to even more Thragtusks.

The sideoard is a work in process, but if the meta shifts heavily towards UW control decks, it is going to need an overhaul with how it finishes games, since Nicol Bolas still rolls to a Detention Sphere, which I expect to be popular following the Todd Anderson's win at the SCG open this past weekend.  Right now, it looks like Dreadbore is faily underplayed, even by BR zombies, who much prefer additional .
burn.

This is very rough draft, but I think the concept could be cleaned up into a solid tier 1.5/2 deck. I've playtested a few rounds on cockatrice, and I'm fairly impressed. Everybody I faced underestimated the power of Shrieking Affliction in a control deck, and if you can get 2 or 3 in play you are basically aggro.  
   

  I didn't find anybody playing zombies, however. And thats probably my toughest matchup, but hopefully maindecking 4 Deathrite Shamans is enough to keep me from getting demolished. I also feel a few of my wins were simply from my opponents underestimating the deck and not playing around my cards. So, the deck needs some work to be viable.

* [Tezzeret, Agent of Bolas](http://magiccards.info/query?q=!Tezzeret,%20Agent%20of%20Bolas&amp;v=card&amp;s=cname)
* [Elixir of Immortality](http://magiccards.info/query?q=!Elixir%20of%20Immortality&amp;v=card&amp;s=cname)

I use this combo in my lifegain artifact deck. My deck ramps out large amounts of mana very quickly via Pristine Talisman, Manalith, Palladium Myr, and Leaden Myr. I dig for these cards with Tezzeret, Agent of Bolas, and then proceed to tap Otherworld Altas up to 4-5 counters quite quickly because of the untapping effects of Unwinding Clock.

Eventually, as I have a lot of mana on the field, I can play out a single hand VERY quickly, playing 4-5 cards in a turn. When I can replenish my hand to 6-7, I'll tap Otherworld Atlas ON MY OPPONENTS TURN to make both players draw 4-5 cards. The idea is to make them flood their hand, forcing them to discard. If I want to speed this process up, I'll do it every time on their turn, and discard cards myself, and simply put them back into my library with an Elixir of Immortality.

Tournament quality? Heck no. Fun in casual? Oh yes.

The only problem is, I know there are probably other cards out there that could go and fit this little combo even better. Anyone have any ideas?

[Tamiyo](http://castlesandcooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/u-tamiyo-the-moon-sage.jpg) costs 5, same as the big Jace.

Her big ability is unlike anything I know - part library of leng, part enduring renewal, and more; and it turns everything into valuetown.  Nothing goes in your graveyard from anywhere, it all goes to your hand (if you want), so you could use self-mills to draw.  Clearly a game ender, but it takes 5 turns to activate on top of the 5 cost. 

[Tibalt](http://castlesandcooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/r-tibalt-the-fiend-blooded.jpg) (prince of cats?) is the cheapest planeswalker yet (RR), who's abilities are a mini-[desperate ravings](http://magiccards.info/isd/en/139.html), a [Gaze of Adamaro](http://magiccards.info/sok/en/98.html) (and a poke in Tamiyo's eye) and big ability is [insurrection](http://magiccards.info/on/en/213.html) or a mass [traitorous blood](http://magiccards.info/isd/en/166.html).

After doing a bit of tidying up, i noticed a few dodgy posts, and decided to put in a new (minor) rule:

This is really a lot more simple and common sense than you might think - all it means is that posts similar to [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Magicdeckbuilding/comments/1il9e8/help_with_grixis_post_rotation/) will get removed, as they add nothing to the subreddit.

Ogre Jailbreaker is the stand-in for Notion Thief.

Deck built around exploiting notion thief. 

The thief/swan combo is an obvious one. The wistful thinking is played on the opponent to either make them discard their last two cards if you don't have notion thief, or 6 card advantage if you do. Gwafa Hazid is a little slow to become effective, but an extra draw plus a pacifism each turn isnt bad if you have a thief out.

Dimir House Guard is used almost exclusively to tutor out a thief, a swan, or a zur depending on the situation.

&gt; Your opponent will start with 20 life, but will gain 3 life during each of their upkeep phases.

&gt; You must defeat your opponent.  Whomever can complete this task in the fewest Turns + Spells Cast will be this weeks winner.

Since the last time I posted this deck, this deck has evolved a lot.

The basic idea is to get an eldrazi out as fast as possible. Just like the link says, you can get out Emrakul on turn 3. This is only one way to do it, but I counted many other ways to do it: 

Turn 1: Forest, tinder wall

Turn 2: forest or glimmerpost, Overgrown battlement. 

Turn 3: Another forest or glimmerpost, tap overgrown battlement, sac tinder wall, use summoning trap, hopefully get emrakul. 


Usually, this deck will get an eldrazi out turn 4 or 5. 


I'm asking this subreddit what they think I should change about this deck to make it even better. 


Edit: When I said legacy, I meant it as in it was technically legal in legacy. THis deck is meant more for fun, sorry. 

Also, the point of the deck isn't solely to get out summoning trap

The end result is pretty far from something I'd play, given my card pool, but was still a fun exercise, so I thought I'd extend it to the group.  So here's the contest: 

**1. Submit your own budget decks**
Here are my arbitrary rules (and feel free to discuss them)

a) The deck must require both red and white mana, but no other colored mana.  Rakdos Cackler is fine, Rix Maadi guildmage is not, Crimson Muckwader is not.

b) The deck must come in for less than **$30** for all cards.  Be sure to mention which site you use to evaluate your prices.  **Note that the price evaluator on TappedOut.com next to the 'coolstuffinc' ad is inaccurate** and does not match coolstuff's prices.  

c) The deck should be reasonably playable.  Maybe not tournament-worthy, but it should hold its own.

d) The deck should include at least some form of 'budget bomb'.  Magic is more fun with splashy cards.  Try to find something you can put in that is fun to draw and play.  (Note: doing so may result in not being able to put in full 4-sets.  I leave it to the discussion board whether or not 1 Hellrider is better than none).

**2. Vote on other people's decks**
Just give an upvote if you think something is good, and if you feel like it, give commentary on why.  Hopefully, the exercise will help some of the newer people understand why we make some of our decisions.

To kick things off, here's my deck (priced at $29.98 by CoolStuffInc):

The main reason I ask is because I strictly buy packs/trade with friends. I do this because I just casually play with a small group of friends and don't go to any FNM events because I don't feel like constructing standard decks. I don't like being limited to just a few sets for them since I've come across some cool cards to trade and individual cards at a card shop. 

Lately, a few of my friends have been going nuts buying (what I'm guessing at this point) $100s worth of cards. As someone who is relying solely on what I pull/find/trade to make decks, it's really obnoxious when my friends are buying 2, 3, even 4 play sets for their decks. It gives them a clear advantage but also an overwhelming sense of satisfaction when I kick their ass. 

Anyway, the point of this thread was to see how people go about acquiring their cards and if you *do* buy your cards online, how often/how many/for what purpose do you buy them? 

At this point I'm sick of having my friends tell me that they have this playset coming in or they're bidding on this, etc. So I may just silently build a deck purely off eBay or what-have-you and see how it does.

Got a U/B Intro Deck that focused on Zombies and I fell in love, so I decided to do a Mono Black Zombie deck.

[Here is my current deck](http://deckbox.org/sets/197046?) *(Note: The sideboard isn't complete, I only listed cards I had that might work)*

I took suggestions from other decks and created this and have been tweaking it ever since. I haven't lost with it versus my friends, and it usually takes them out by the 6th/7th turn. I know there is always room for improvement though as I haven't played versus any really good decks.

**Concerns I have**

* I removed a few high costing spells and added in 4 [Highborn Ghouls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=242503). I'm wondering if this brings my creature count (24) too high. I feel having Intimidate will help me avoid creatures with protection from black from blocking me.

* I think I have too many creature removal spells. They definitely have helped in letting my creatures attack unblocked, and the low cost for these instants seem too good to give up. However, I feel that I need some sort of spell counters or enchantment/artifact destroying cards. I don't know enough cards to figure out which to add though, at least to my sideboard. I don't know what other type of spells I should have for this type of deck.

* 22 Lands. Since my highest mana cost is only 4, and most cost between 2-3 I'm wondering if I can get away with only 20 mana in this deck.

* Sideboard. I currently don't have one. On my deckbox I have a few ideas for cards listed on there that I think could work well, but I'd really love to get down a great sideboard. My knowledge of cards outside of what I have is rather limited.

**Goal of my deck**

The basic goal of my deck is to get out many low cost Zombies in order to overwhelm my opponent quickly, and reraise them. Low cost Instant removal spells to stop any blockers. And Lashwrithe to make a fat Zombie to take out any high toughness blockers, or use as a wall myself.

Any and all help is greatly appreciated. I am open to any and all critiques and comments.

Tempered Steel is an (almost) mono-white fast agro deck building around an amazing [Anthem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=129572).  With very early (several on 0 mana) and very aggressive creatures, the Battle Cry of combat shall herald their metallic victory.  

[Here's](http://www.mtgtop8.com/event?e=2563&amp;d=216642) a fairly standard Tempered Steel decklist and the subject of today's Deck Tech. This is the W/g variety, but there is another W/u version that has been making the rounds as well.

**Lands**

With an extremely shallow curve, most spells coming in below the 2 mana mark, topping out a singleton Hero at 4, mana can be fast and loose making room for more action in hand.


[Razorverge Thicket](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=209407) is the first non-basic land.  Using a Scars fast-land over [Sunpetal Grove](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=221923) is optimal, because of how shallow the mana curve is.  With (almost) all of the action before the fast-land enters tapped, it is highly beneficial to have access to the land the turn it hits the battlefield regardless of when it hits.  This green splash is only for 1 card, coincidentally, another land.  [Gavony Township](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=233242).  While costly to activate (requiring at least 5 lands under your control) it gives the deck some late game viability should it get there.  And with the low color commitment of the deck, being unable to produce colored mana isn't a big downside.

The W/u version of Tempered Steel runs [Seachrome Coast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=209399) instead of Razorverge Thicket for the access to blue.  And like Gavony Township the splash is almost entirely for a land, in this case [Moorland Haunt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=233239).  Creating a lot of flying spirit tokens allows for a constant barrage of flyers coming at your opponent for a war of attrition clock.

[Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=213731) is the last non-basic land.  Few decks aren't made better by including Inkmoth, and Tempered Steel is no exception.  Being an artifact makes it especially good in this deck.  Turning on Metalcraft and getting buffed by Tempered Steel.  This 1/1 flying infector isn't a win condition all on his own, but always helps to put your opponents in an awkward position.

**Creatures**

[Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=194078) is your 0 mana shock trooper.  This little walker is the beginnings of your early aggro strategy.  With the abundance of 1 drops, any time you get an opening hand with memnite, odds are you will have 2 creatures on the field at the end of your first turn.  A 1/1 may not seem like much, but with the synergies in this deck it's a lot more than just a cheap beater.

[Signal Pest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=213773) is a potentially huge source of damage.  Battle Cry makes every agressive move you make that much more powerful.  And with his pseudo-flying you should have battle cry up during every attack step.  As your forces grow larger so does the impact of battle cry.  And better yet, they stack.  Two Pests will buff each other making them 1/1's and buffing your memnite to be a 3/1.  

[Vault Skirge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=217984) is another big impactful 1 drop.  You have no black source so you will always be paying the Phyrexian 2 life cost to cast this flyer.  Very likely you will be gaining that 2 life back through lifelink.  2 turn attacking, but with Battle Cry you get it back right away, Tempered Steel makes things even better.  Vault Skirge gives you some longevity with more drawn out games, and helps with burn based matchups.  

[Etched Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=215099) can be another good beater for you.  With Metalcraft turned on (should be often with your high density of artifacts) he's likely unblockable and immune to damage from colored sources.  It can chump with no fear of destruction, of swing in uncontested depending on your situation.

[Glint Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=206358) is your first non-artifact creature, and it can bring some beats.  A turn 1 2/2 flyer is nothing to shake a stick at, and his artifact bounce is usually a negligable cost.  bouncing a 0 mana artifact just to drop it again is usually your optimal play, and allows for some shenanigans as the game goes on.

[Hero of Bladehold](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=214064) is the topper for your curve.  A 4 mana beast in this deck.  Battle Cry to help you swing for the win, and extra lasting 1/1 (sadly non artifact) tokens for more destructive power as the game goes on.  The 4 mana cost on this monster is very intimidating given your low density of lands, occasionally lower costed removal (such as [Oblivion Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=234567) are used in its place).

**Instants**

[Dispatch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=218072) is your go-to removal option.  When Metalcraft is on this is one of the best removal spells you can run.  even without metalcraft you can still use this to tap down a threat to allow more damage in.  Knowing when to dispatch your opponent's creatures is extremely important, knowing how long to hold on to it, and what threats need to be removed right away.

**Enchantments**

[Tempered Steel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=194391) is the card that lends it's name to the deck.  When this bad boy hits the field, everything start getting scary.  Memnites beef up to 3/3, Inkmoth puts then on a 4 turn clock, Vault Skirge starts gaining you plenty of life every turn, Signal Pest starts doing damage alone, etc.  All of your artifacts speed up their clock, and make blocking and attacking very difficult for your opponent.

**Artifacts**

[Mox Opal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=208248) is some mana fixing for you.  Even though you're running 20 lands, you have some extra mana with metalcraft.  but it's real strength is turning on metalcraft. as a 0 mana artifact you get to drop this on turn 1 for free.  you can have metalcraft up on turn 1 quite easilly.  Turn 1, you dropa plains, Memnite, Signal Pest, Mox Opal. you then have metalcraft up allowing you to tap opal for a white mana, then play Glint Hawk bouncing Opal back to your hand, the play opal again and tap it again for more mana and play another Vault Skirge. That's 7 damage ready to go on turn 2, not even RDW can match the explosive potential of Tempered Steel.

[Glint Hawk Idol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=194049) is another beater for you.  With your high density of action cards, you should be able to drop an artifact very reliably, turning this into a 2/2 flying artifact for free.  If you don't have the action in hand, you can just pay the 1 mana and animate it for more artifacty flying beats.

[Origin Spellbomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=210239) is a nifty card for helping you get card advantage and interacting with Glint Hawk Idol.  By dropping the spellbomb for 1, you can trigger the idol.  Cracking the bomb for a myr token paying 1W you get to draw a card, and the myr token entering the battlefield re-triggers glint hawk for a second ""free"" activation.

Tempered Steel is occasionally put down as ""simple"" magic with a lot of turning cards sideways, but the intricacy's and synergies of this deck make it the thinking man's aggro beatdown deck.

1372145479.0,8,self.Magicdeckbuilding,1h0xij,[Casual] Homebrew Duel Deck: Phyrexia vs Eldrazi,Viltris,8,0,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Magicdeckbuilding/comments/1h0xij/casual_homebrew_duel_deck_phyrexia_vs_eldrazi/,"(cross posting from r/magictcg to a more appropriate subreddit)

So Phyrexia vs Eldrazi has been an inside joke for a long time now. And I wanted to flex my Johnny muscles and not spend too much money, so I figured, why not make my own Phyrexia vs Eldrazi Duel Deck? (I'd be surprised if this has never been done before, but I didn't want to look at other people's homebrew duel decks and bias myself.)

Phyrexia: http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/homebrew-duel-deck-phyrexia-vs-eldrazi-phyrexia/ Eldrazi: http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/homebrew-duel-deck-phyrexia-vs-eldrazi-eldrazi/

In the spirit of duel decks, I decided each deck would have at most 4 rares/mythic rares. Also, there'd be at most 2 of any common, and at most 1 of anything else (other than basic lands).

The first major decision to make was should Phyrexia include New Phyrexia or just the classic Yawgmoth era Phyrexians. A quick poll with a few friends came up classic Phyrexians, so the deck would be mono-black with lots of artifacts. To keep things flavorful, I limited myself to only blocks during the Weatherlight saga (Weatherlight through Apocalypse) and blocks that took place on Dominaria (Ice Age block and Time Spiral block). Also, I specifically decided not to repeat any cards from Phyrexia vs Coalition. Not all of my picks are flavor homeruns, but as far as I can tell, none of them are flavor fails either.

The Eldrazi deck would obviously be a ramp deck, and it would obviously be very good at gumming up the ground, so I wanted the Phyrexia deck to be a beatdown deck with some evasion. The tricky part was finding the right level of evasion. Too much evasion, and Phyrexia would just roll over Eldrazi. Not enough evasion, and the Phyrexia deck would just get stalled.

So the Phyrexia deck's game plan is to stick creatures and beat face until it wins. In the late game, it has bombs like Greven, Gallowbraid, Morinfen, and Phyrexian Snowcrusher to help it win. Sure, none of these are ""good"" cards, but they're just good enough that, left unanswered, will tear the Eldrazi apart.

Your removal suite consists of Rathi Trappers (which tap down both big Eldrazi and blockers), Melancholy (your answer to Ulamog), Seal of Doom (your answer to Emrakul), Big Game Hunter (takes down big guys), and Vile Requiem (an early Vile Requiem is pretty disgusting). Phyrexian Etchings helps you refuel when you run out of steam and makes for some interesting play decisions.

I previously tried sticking in Volrath, Phyrexian Scuta, and Phyrexian Delver. But as it turns out, Volrath and the Scuta just kept running into Eldrazi Spawn, and the Phyrexian Delver just didn't add enough aggression to the deck. I also tried including more disruption, in the form of cards like Ostracize, Addle, and Psychotic Episode, but I quickly discovered that those cards whiff more often than I liked. Ravenous Rats is the only remnant of the disruption sub-theme in the deck. I also tried adding p/t boosting auras like Unholy Strength, Sinister Strength, and Phyrexian Boon, to try to get the guys on the ground through for more damage. But as it turns out, chump blocking with an Eldrazi Spawn meant the p/t boosts didn't matter. Plus, we all know auras generate card disadvantage. Even cards like Fallen Ideal and Sleeper's Guile lost out to instant speed removal.

What about the Eldrazi deck? Since the Eldrazi come in red, green, and black, and I didn't want overlap, the Eldrazi ended up a red-green deck. Which is good, because green provides the ramp, and red provides the burn. To make things flavorful, I limited myself to only Zendikar block cards. Not everything is a flavor homerun. For example, why are Ondu Giant, Greenweaver, Frontier Guide, and Joraga Treespeaker helping the Eldrazi? Because they make the gameplay better, so I'm willing to take the flavor hit.

In any case, we have a bunch of Eldrazi Spawn cards, as well as cards that generate mana on their own, and cards that fetch land. Many of these ramp cards also provide bodies that can play defense (or offense if Phyrexia is wide open). Worst case scenario, you can always chump block with an Eldrazi Spawn. Broodwarden pumps your Eldrazi Spawn and frequently leads to ""surprise, I win"" moments.

Your finishers are The Big Three, plus three more of the smaller, friendlier Eldrazi. This should be pretty straightforward. If one of your Eldrazi gets locked down by Melancholy or is about to be killed by a Seal of Doom, Momentous Fall turns them into cards and life.

For the burn, I made a conscious decision not to let the burn target players (with the exception Burst Lightning, which deals minimal damage). This is because I wanted Eldrazi to win by beating face with Eldrazi, rather than a ""surprise, I deal lethal with a giant fireball"". That said, I'm considering swapping out Momentous Fall for Comet Storm, since Comet Storm can serve as both removal and an additional win condition.

So after a week of tweaking and a few hours of playtesting every day, I finally got the decks to a state I'm happy with. I still want to have my friends playtest them, but I'm happy with them. They're easy to play, but not to the point of mindlessness. Because the decks are mostly 1-ofs and 2-ofs, the variance is quite high. Sometimes, Phyrexia aggros out and rolls over the Eldrazi. Sometimes, Eldrazi ramps into a fast Hand or Crusher and stomps Phyrexia. Sometimes, there's a lot of back and forth, and both decks play their bombs, only to get their bombs killed. And that's the way I like it. Overall, the power-level between the two decks is pretty close (although I think Phyrexia has a slight edge).

So let me know what you think. Feedback? Suggestions? Thanks!",,False,,t5_2sv87,False,,,True,t3_1h0xij,http://www.reddit.com/r/Magicdeckbuilding/comments/1h0xij/casual_homebrew_duel_deck_phyrexia_vs_eldrazi/,

I honestly just came up with putting some of these cards together and was wondering what you guys think.

I know old variants of Guttersnipe relied on Burn, but this is much more in the control vein.  I haven't played this deck at all yet but have a few questions:

* Am I relying on Guttersnipe too much?  I don't have much burn - basically my only win-con is to get Guttersnipe out, protect him, and use cheap spells / cantrips to blast my way to victory.  Think of it as slow, inevitable burn...

* I did have Boros Reckoners in instead of the Delvers, with a Harvest Pyre taking up an Epic Experiment spot as an additional win-con.  However, I thought about the difficulty of casting Reckoner  (RRR in this deck) and decided against it.

* Delver.  I've never played a deck with him, and it's the shakiest card in my opinion.  Let's go through:

&gt; Pro: He gives me an additional win-con (three in the air is tough for most decks to deal with consistently) and will flip reliably.  

&gt; Pro: He's a one drop in an aggressive deck that is missing one drops.

&gt; Con: Skylasher.  A big f-you to Delver.  Will decks actually be running it?  Only in SB?

&gt; Con: He's only got a 2 butt.  I'm worried about aggro decks blowing me out - would Auger of Bolas be the better choice?


* Talrand - I'm back and forth on adding this guy.  Seems like an additional win-con, but would A) make my curve higher and B) make me tap out on T4 - I don't think I want to do this most games.  I'm winning if I can land a Snipe T3 and play control.

* Blasphemous Act - Do I need it?  It's in for a wipe against aggro, but it also wipes my win con.  My thoughts are that if I need to cast it I'm probably already sunk - I think something else would fit better (more counters)

**Edit - Had never seen 'Curiosity' - threw 2 in - any thoughts?

Thanks for all the help!

Hey guys! Hopefully going to FNM next week, so I'm looking to improve on my mono-black discard deck. The idea is to force them to discard 2-4 cards from their original hand, so all they have left is nothing in their hand, a few mana on the board, and maybe a creature or two. Then get some shrieking afflicitions on the board so they're scared to play cards that would make them have 1 or 0 cards left. 

Alternate win con if the game goes a few more turns is endless ranks of the dead. 

Undying evil works REALLY well with bone splinters. If I have a rat or a black cat, I can beef up my creature, destroy one of theirs, and make them discard a card all for a total of 2 mana.

Hi Reddit,


I'm fairly new to magic and I've been playing this Black/White zombies deck. I've been trying to make modifications so that I can try and place at my LGS for the weekly standard. 

For the past 2 FNMs I've been going 1-2 and I find that I struggle against every kind of deck including RDW, Mono Green, American Control, and Reanimator.  There doesn't seem to be a deck that I can consistantly beat.  

The main combo of the deck is to use zombie aggro as well as Cartel Aristocrat as a sac outlet in combination with blood artist's effect.  However, I'm finding that Cartel Aristocrat often feels too slow and insignificant of a threat.  

I'm looking for any kind of advice so that I can better my deck including suggestions for creatures, enchantments/sorceries/instants as well as my mana base!

I bought myself the 2013 deckbuilder and some cards and my deck looks like this (its from Simon's Budget Guide):

2 Hellion Crucible
22 Mountain

4 Pillar of Flame
4 Searing Spear
4 Brimstone Volley

4 Rakdos Cackler
4 Stromkirk Noble
4 Ash Zealot
4 Rakdos Shred-Freak
4 Lightning Mauler
4 Gore-House Chainwalker

Sideboard: 
4 Tormod's Crypt
4 Reckless Waif
4 Flames of the Firebrand
3 Traitorous Blood

So now my questions:
the next steps would be 
- Hellrider (how many?)
- Thundermaw Hellkite (as many as I can afford?) 
what cards need to go out of the deck?

and the other question is: what cards can improve this deck massively for just casual matches with friends? (older editions and/or not too expensive cards)

anyway this is a great Subreddit, thanks for all the lovely posts.

I tried to add Nevermore, as an answer to Abrupt Decay, but Simic Charm or Boros Charm might be better. Touch of the Eternal was a two-of for a while too. Adding green to the deck gave the deck some consistency and that touch of lifegain, but it's not set in stone. 

The deck loses game one to the nut aggro draw, but it's got enough stall and delay to get to board wipes and such. Assemble the Legion and Jace are the only win conditions. Feeling of Dread plus Blind Obedience is just amazing against the Boros and Jund decks in my meta.

This deck is great against the aggro matchup because 9 times out of 10 I can get out a chump blocker to respond to immediate threats. If you get to Turn 4 you just explode (I won a game last night with a T5 Corpsejack Menace swinging in as a 16/16) I have a few problems with the control matchup but unless they're countering everything I can usually swing through for the win.

Primordial Hydra can end games on its own. Having a Corpsejack out makes things more ridiculous. Side in Bioshift for shenanigans after your opponent declares blockers. Revenge of the Hunted has saved my skin on multiple occasions.

My only concern is against the Bant Control (Thrag/Resto shenanigans) matchup. A T5 Thragtusk hitting the field poses a real problem for me. Throw in Resto Angel and suddenly my opponent has a significant life advantage.

""Teacher"" decks?",Electrodyne,8,2,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Magicdeckbuilding/comments/16n1z4/a_casual_challenge_teacher_decks/,"Someone asked in /r/MagicTCG the other day about good ways to teach someone to play Magic.  I replied with the following:

&gt;Start by constructing two decks, approximately equal to one another, monocolored.   
&gt;_**Oldschool slow:** 20 lands/20 Creatures/20 Spells._ Commons are best, and a theme can make things more fun for them.  
&gt;**Creatures:** Vanilla is better, 4-ofs so they're reliable, and card art is important. EtB and triggered abilities are okay here, but hold off on activated abilities until later. CMC curve should be 4x1/8x2-3/8x4+  
&gt;**Spells:** Sorceries and Enchantments; only stuff that can be cast on each player's turn. No instants/interrupts...yet.  
&gt;**Lands:** 20 basics.  
&gt;**Sleeves:** Attractive to your new pupil.  
&gt;Do yourself a favor and don't make either of these decks blue.  
&gt;_Make a third deck using the same rules that runs two colors and slightly more land. You'll need it in a few nights._

&gt;[An example in White](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/w-trainer/)

&gt;After a few games or even a few nights of playing, they should have a good idea what their deck does and what your deck does. Try swapping as well so they can get comfortable with both colors. Once these basics are established and comfortable, hand them both decks and let them combine them into a single dual-color deck with their favorite cards from both monocolored decks.  
&gt;Now pull out your simple two-color deck and have at it for several more games/nights.

&gt;Soon, it's time to introduce Fast Effects. Do this by replacing some of each deck's creatures with some that have activated abilities. After a few games with these, replace some sorcery/enchantment cards with appoximate instants/interrupts, and 2-3 lands with utility lands. Play more!

&gt;_Finally, build a time machine and go back to warn yourself about the monster you're about to create._

What I'm asking for help with here, is a few more ""trainer"" decks that fit the Part 1 requirements.  I plan on using them to teach the 11-year-old.  
Bonus points of they include a sideboard that's a pool of fast effects for Phase 2.

I've been playing this deck to fairly good success, but it still falls short against certain matchups.  Boros/RDW pose problems for me, mainly because of the deck's inherent life loss/suicidal nature.  

I am always open to suggestions, however.  Just a few notes:

I have tried 2x Vendilion Clique in the mainboard...they were okay but most of the time not necessary and always acted like a very good beater for a 2-3 turns.  I took her out in favor of 2x Countersquall, however, because I feel like Countersquall can pack a bit of a stronger punch and provide even more food for Snapcaster - the bleed effect of the small counters/creatures/bolts really adds up, especially when you're holding a Snapcaster.

Anyway - thanks in advance!

It's not objectively good, but there's just something satisfying about giving your opponent a constant ""[Sophies Choice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie%27s_Choice)"" with [mind rot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=15828) effects, purposeful destruction with [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=14557) type effects, and true chaos of random discard [Hymn to Tourach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=1850) effects.  

&gt; You must completely empty your opponents hand.  Your opponent will make each of their first 3 land drops and use constant [Divination](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=254118) for slow methodical card advantage.

&gt; Whomever can complete this task in the fewest turns+spells will be this week's winner.

The newer players get disillusioned after playing with him, and it's rather annoying to watch. Now I have played Magic for a few years, but I am not into super amazing decks. I build around themes I like, and they have to be fun and lose just as easily as winning. I have beaten this player before with a few of my hugely suboptimal decks, but he has beaten me just as much. I don't have fun playing against him, because he is so annoying to deal with whether he is winning or losing. It's all ""luck"" if he loses, and he will complain about it.

I have listed other cards I am considering for the deck in my maybeboard.

Here are some of my problems/questions:

1) While Quirion Ranger is a very important card, having more than 1 in play is somewhat a waste, so I am thinking of lowering Quirion from 4x to 3x.

2) Garruk's Companion, while a good card, doesn't seem as valuable as playing two cards that each cost G.

3) Maybe lower Bounty of the Hunt from 4x to 3x, because too many can force me to exile too many useful cards.

4) Vine Dryad seems outdated, but maybe a 1/3 with forest walk for free is worth it? I guess the 1 damage isn't that helpful, and I really don't need 3 strength.

5) I might want another enchantment instead of Might of Old Krosa. Spider Umbra, Briar Shield, and Seal of Strength are my top candidates, but I'm not sure which one.

6) If I don't want another enchantment, should I have Mutagenic Growth, Groundswell or Giant Growth instead of Might of Old Krosa as an instant?

7) Silhana Ledgewalker seems great, but is 1 power worth its 1G manacost? It wouldn't really be worth playing unless I put a Rancor on it, and is a 3/1 with Hexproof and Flying worth 1GG?

8) Jungle Lion also seems nice, but how can I fit it in? Perhaps instead of Garruk's Companion, or I can reduce Quirion, Bounty, and Garruk's by 1x each and add 3x Jungle Lion?

9) I've always considered Winter Orb essential, but would it be better to keep it on my sideboard and put in more creatures instead?

10) Some of the Hidden cards seem interesting. Hidden Spider might be good on the sideboard (does it work against Delver of Secrets?). Hidden Guerrillas seems VERY good against artifact decks.

11) Memnite gives the best power to manacost ratio out of any creature I have, but it's so vanilla it doesn't seem worth it. Is it better than I think it is?

Any tips or advice on my questions or on things I didn't mention would be greatly appreciated! Thanks :)!

Edit: I am on a budget, so that means no berserk :(

U/W Delver is a midrange (agro-control) deck and works in the spirit of Tempo. Tempo is all about generating advantage and then pressing that advantage to win. When you force your oponent to play defensively, you have more options and really get to dictate the flow of the game. That's the agro side of tempo, the control side allows you to capitalise on your early threats and maintain board advantage through bounce and counter spells.

Today we'll be looking at Jon Finkel's U/W/b Delver Spirits deck that took him to the top 8 in Honolulu. You can find a [decklist here](http://www.mtgtop8.com/event? e=2518&amp;d=216330). While U/W/b spirits will be the focus, much of this holds true for other U/W Delver decks.

**Land**

With a fast and aggressive deck on a very low mana curve the mana base has to be equally fast and aggressive.

[Seachrome Coast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=209399) is a true all-star here, with the most important (all but 1) cards coming down at or before 3 mana Seachrome Coast is a better pick than [Glacial Fortress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=221919), especially given the low density of basic lands in this deck. That doesn't discount Glacial Fortress' benefit, it's still a dual land and helps to fix any complex mana base.

[Darkslick Shores](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=209400) is effectively an Island in the basic land count. The only real purpose for the black is for Lingering Souls Flashback. Even then, it's really a bonus instead of a core aspect of the deck. In acting like an island it is once again important to have access to blue mana early, so Darkslick Shores is taken over [Drowned Catacomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=221920).

[Evolving Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=262680) is a great addition to this deck, it thins out lands to increase the density of ""action"" cards while giving access to any of the 3 colors that you need. It may slow down your temp a bit, but with your early pressure and 1 mana threats this is rarely a real issue.

[Moorland Haunt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=233239) is a great source of utility. Thinning graveyards against reanimator decks and creating spirits for you. These 1/1 flying spirits are another toolbox of versatility. They can act as weenies to chump, or an evasive threat to swarm your enemy. With buffs from Drogskol Captain these weenies can become quite a threat in themselves.

**Creatures**

[Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=226749) is the card that lends its name to the deck. With the high density of sorcories and instants even without a ""Ponder"" setup it has about a 1/3 chance of flipping right off the bat. Once flipped this [""the fly""](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091064/) homage is a real threat. As a 3/2 flyer it puts your opponents on a 7 turn clock by itself.

[Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=227676) makes every blue deck better, a 2/1 body with flash is pretty good on its own, but flashing back a counterspell or removal is just brutal.

[Phantasmal Image](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=220099) is your toolbox card. Legendary killer, aggro assistance, or an extra copy of your spirit lord.  Having Drogskol Captain and a Illusion copy is awesome because they give each other hexproof, meaning your illusion can hang around and not worry about dying to targeting (similar to Image copy [Lord of the Unreal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=220131).

[Drogskol Captain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=244773) is your spirit lord.  This is mostly for pumping your 1/1 spirits, but becomes extremely hard to deal with if you can get a second captain out on the field.  With multiple copies each hexproofs each other and buffs each other, and any extra flying damage is always a good thing.

[Dungeon Geists](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=249875) Tops out your curve at 4 mana.  He's a decent body for damage, but is mostly here for his control.  Permanently tapping down a creature is as good as [pacifying](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=228956) them, with the added bonus of disallowing activated abilities that require the creature to tap.

**Instants and Sorcories**

[Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=244313) is possibly one of the most important cards in this deck.  Using ponder to set up a Delver flip.  Searching out whatever card you need.  And shuffling away when you can't find it.  It gives card advantage, and helps you build tempo by setting up the cards you need when you need them.  

[Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=233056) is another card advantage spell.  For 2 life you get to peak at your opponents hand, this can tell you if you need to hang on to a counter, if they have a combat trick, or are holding on to [triple Galvanic Blast](http://youtu.be/UipZNYQpZvo).  Best of all, it thins your deck allowing you to find those cards you need a little bit faster.

[Lingering Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=262695) is the reason for the black splash in this deck.  Getting 2 spirit tokens is great, getting 2 more for less is even better.  These spirit tokens are just like Moorland Haunt tokens, the can be used to increase your clock through agro, or can chump when you're getting beaten on.  When compared to [Midnight Haunting](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=221214) the sorcory speed isn't as much a drawback as having the cheap flashback is simply amazing.

[Vapor Snag](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=249373) is the first in your suite of control.  Bouncing an opponents' creature and doing a little damage, to let more damage through is everything this deck could ask for.  Any help to race that life total down to 0 is just what the deck needs.

[Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=241831) is debatable the best counterspell in standard.  Since this is a fast deck rarely will you need the hard counter that [Dissipate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=241985) offers, so the extra mana saved and turn earlier counter is invaluable.

[Revoke Existence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=194123), [Gut Shot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=230074), and [Divine Offering](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=213760) are all singletons in this deck.  Because this deck sees a lot of cards through the constant Pondering and Probing it isn't too hard to get them to show up when you REALLY need them.  These additions were more geared for the meta at Pro-Tour DKA so they man/may-not be essential in this deck when going to your FNM.

**SIDEBOARD** 

The sideboard in U/W Delver is really to help you control the board a bit better.  You have a medley of removal to board in against different decks, often you will be playing ""the agro"", but will sometimes need to play as ""the control"" depending on your matchup.  Here's the sideboard that Finkel used in his top 8 deck.

* 1 Phantasmal Image 

* 2 Dungeon Geists 

* 1 Mana Leak 

* 1 Revoke Existence 

* 2 Gut Shot

I would use high-toughness creatures and damage mitigation (ex. Fog) to keep myself alive while I set up. Then, once they had more mana than life, I'd naturalize upwelling for the kill. (City of solitude would be in my sideboard for decks that could empty their mana pool too well on my turn).

From that you can probably tell I prefer indirect/surprise wins that don't really involve simple rushing or direct damage.

1. I need more removal, prolly push to 4 putrefy and maybe a few abrupt decays (too bad they are expensive!). What to remove though? 

2. For Being built around scavenge....i only have three creatures that even are ""scavengable""....however the other scavenge creatures in the deck are WAYYYY too expensive to scavenge. (However this isn't strictly a deck ""built"" around scavenge, it's just one where it uses it to it's biggest advantage).

Questions:

1. Originally I had Varolz the scar-striped in my deck, in place of Vraska, but someone pointed out that most of my creatures have Scavenge so it wasn't really worth it. Should I put him back in? (I had 2 ) Almost seems like sort of a waste.

2. Vraska....is she worth it? Im not really using her as a win condition, more-so just as ""extra removal"" for her -3.

3. Any other ideas? Does the deck seem ok? I've had people tell me to remove gutter grime (which I understand, but it's more in there because I enjoy it), and to up Deaths presence to 4 or remove it (but I always feel weird about having 4 of the same enchantment).

I'm not running the ""flash"" variant because I just got back into the game and don't feel like buying up a bunch of snapcasters and angels that are going to rotate out soon. 

Other than that the deck is pretty standard. I'll be running azorius charm, supreme verdict, think twice yadda yadda. 

However, I'm really torn on a third color for this deck, which I think I need to put it over the top. The obvious choices here are red or black.

Black gives me access to:

* [far // away](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=369042), which I think is a cool, versatile card 

* [Warped physique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=369094) and [Devour Flesh](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=366379), which are both efficient removal spells. 

* and...that's it?

* Edit: I guess think twice would be in this category as well, because it's not worth playing unless you can pay for the (black) flashback cost.

Meanwhile, red gives me access to:

* [Turn // Burn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=369080), which in my opinion is good, but less effective overall compared to far//away

* [Warleader's Helix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=369081)? I've seen this card in quite a few decks, but I'm not convinced that it's that good, it seems overpriced for being glorified removal. 

* [Aurelia's Fury](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=366384)? Could be efficient removal but again, not sure how good this is. 

* [Izzet Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=253528) seems like good sideboard material

* [Thoughtflare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=253551) as perhaps a (very very) poor man's Sphinx's Revelation if I can't get any in time. Is there a better alternative? 

* [Assemble the Legion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=366470). This is the biggest thing drawing me into red. I think this card is hugely underrated and highly versatile, as it can play both offense and defense.

1.  Mill a few, Consuming Aberration, Any spell for a while, Get him big.  Make him fly with Skygames or intimidating with shadow-alley denizen.  

2.  Phantasms and wights.  Overwhelm with them after a few mill cards beef them both up.

Win cons are mill, or beatdown with Aetherling/Consuming Abberation.

I've ran a BUG Millgro deck before. It was fun but I decided to cut out green, and make the deck more control oriented. 

As per the title, I'm concerned about the number of counterspells and creatures in my deck. I have 4 counterspells (Psychic Strike), and 2 that act like a counter (Dimir Charm). I'm not sure if that would be enough. 

I'm also concerned for my creature count. I have a playset of Vampire Nighthawks to help stabilize the board. I have one Consuming Aberration and one Aetherling as win cons, and I have a couple of Deathrite Shamans for early aggro and to play around with an opponents graveyard. One thing I did enjoy with my Millgro deck was ramping with Deathrite. I figured I keep a couple around to play with the opponents graveyard more. I'd include Snapcasters but I don't have the budget, and people are looking to use or hold on to him. 

Do I have enough counterspells? I have some Syncopates, and I could add them to this deck. With respect to my creatures, are there any I should be considering? I was thinking of removing Consuming Aberration and adding another Aetherling (or vice versa). I also have Mirko Vosk who I could add.

Any thoughts would be appreciated. ",,False,,t5_2sv87,False,,,True,t3_1hbl6s,http://www.reddit.com/r/Magicdeckbuilding/comments/1hbl6s/standardub_control_concerned_about_the_number_of/,

I've whipped up this fairly budget homebrew deck that runs great against decks I run in the current format. The deck is aggro focused, with pumping up dungrove elder by abusing Harrow, Garruk Wildspeaker, and Viridian Emissary. If I don't happen to ramp up my Dungrove and pop a rancor onto it to win, the deck does well with the 8 one and two drop undying creatures (Young Wolf &amp; Strangleroot Geist) pummeling down with the pump spells (Mutagenic, Hunger of the Howlpack, Rancor). Late game I'm rolling Garruk, Thragtusk and Vorapede.

In the sidedeck I have Ambush Viper for aggro decks (looking at red), Naturalize for obvious reasons, Prey Upon for things I can't touch (flying, unblockable, etc.), Vines of Vastwood if I'm facing some type of creature control.

I'm not looking for any major changes to the deck (although I am open to suggestions!), as I'm pretty happy with how its running, but I need some help with tweaking the numbers  - I'm not sure how many land I should be running or how many cards I should be running. The only thing I know is that I definitely need another Garruk, but haven't been able to get one from any LGS. I felt like running over 21 land would be too much, maybe 20 would be okay, as I have Harrow, Llanowar Elves, and Viridian Emissary.

I got some advice that Extort was pretty shitty as a main mechanic, and was better served as a backup mana sink late in the game.  I decided this was a good plan.  I replaced half my Extorters with Exalted creatures (I figure lots of exalted are good early, then I can extort my exalted creatures when they come in later since they'er so cheap).  I had 4 Knights of Infamy/Glory, and a few Duty-Bound dead.

The problem I experienced was that most of my creatures were dealt with easily because they were 2/1s or 1/1s.  They were destroyed by cheap creature removal, and I was left with no cards in hand.  They don't have the staying power of bigger creatures that would utilize all my mana, and I don't have the drawing power of Underworld Connections (card shop doesn't have it).

I'm looking at what else I can do with my deck besides exalted.  I'm not sure if I should throw in a splash of some other color and some big creatures, or if i should try to make exalted work. 

I'd really like to get a workable deck based on the cards I've bought already.  I have everything from Orzhov Power, Duel Decks Sorin vs Tibalt, and tons from Dragon's Maze/Gatecrash boosters and singles I've bought.  Mostly Black/White (think smite, murder, victim of the night, etc)

While I do realize this deck loses to a counter-heavy hand, it does okay against RDW.  I'm just seeing if this can be made viable.  

The basic idea - cast things, get a crypt ghast into play on turn 4.  Wait for them to tap out and then Clan Defiance to the dome, gaze of granite their doods, drop a Sire of Insanty. Rinse, repeat.  

The Deck.

* 4 Blood Crypt
* 4 Overgrown Tomb
* 8 Swamp
* 7 Forest
* 3 Deathrite Shaman
* 4 Abrupt Decay
* 4 Grisly Salvage
* 2 Treasured Find
* 4 Putrefy
* 4 Axebane Guardian
* 4 Crypt Ghast
* 4 Sire of Insanity
* 4 Clan Defiance
* 2 Gaze of Granite
* 2 Rakdos's Return

I originally had sphinx's revelations in here for life gain and card draw, but I thought going all five colors was a little wonky.  The Sires of Insanity are a lot of fun against control, but sadly, unless I play a dreadbridge chant or something to get me stuff back from the graveyard or the Sire zombie guy to refill my hand...

Some notes about me and what I do and what I'm thinking about that might help shape deckbuilding advice.

*  I play a lot of multiplayer with my friends, and I'm not sure if this one can stand up well in multiplayer. 
*  I don't have a big budget, hence a lot of one-ofs in the dual-land and cool bombs department, but if you have suggestion on more expensive cards that would be good to invest in or that could really make this shine, that'd be cool.
*  I feel it could be more consistent, but am unsure of what to lose. After playing some one-on-one this evening with a friend, I'm thinking Rakish Heir is a little too slow and I could lose him in favour of bumping up some cards. What do you think should be switched up?
*How does my removal look to you? Should I be doing something different? Should I focus on some more burn, or go for something more consistent?
*  Am I missing out on some flavourfully wonderful cards that would make this deck explode with awesomeness? Cards that make you say, ""EmpyClaw! Why are you not using this flavourfully wonderful card? It would make your deck explode with awesomeness! Add it post-haste! I don't card that it's only legal in legacy and costs as much as the Taj Mahal! Add it now, you fool!""

* Corpse Blockade  
* Gravecrawler  
* Diregraf Captain  
If I sacrifice the Gravecrawler with the Corpse Blockade, the captain's passive ability will do 1 damage to a target player.  Since there's still 2 zombies on the battlefield, I can summon the gravecrawler again from the graveyard and rinse/repeat what I just did.  This basically turns every swamp I own into 1 damage.  2 damage if I end up summoning an extra captain.  
So my question is, if I played a Liliana of the Dark Realms and got out her emblem (where 1 swamp taps for 4 mana), can I do the combo above 4 times with that mana, thus turning 1 swamp into 4 damage?  or is the 4 mana that I tap only available for 1 ""stack"" of spells?

**[Problem Statement]** My current playgroup is casual. Currently the deck field is not DOMINATED but flooded by what I've taken to call Isochron Izzet. U/R, 4 scepters, lightning bolt, counterspell, with worldfire/cyclonic rift thrown in. All games are at least 4 people, 2 headed Giant, Emperor or Assassin being the most common. 


**[Solution?]** [Azor's Pillowfort](http://deckbox.org/sets/317117). My intention is to deny as many of the goto cards as possible and win via the Elocutors. I THINK this would work as long as I don't come up too early as a target. I've never really tried a deck like this before so i want to know if I'm missing anything that would be great. I would really like to get rid of the scepters as well since that is what I'm hating against the most. The ""sideboard"" is other cards that I've considered. 


Thank you again for your time.

Looking to improve spell choices and sideboard.,fa11encypher,7,0,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Magicdeckbuilding/comments/1bn4av/standardbuw_new_glorys_rise_mill_deck_with/,"Deck: [Rise of the Occultist](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/buw-rise-of-the-occultist/)

This deck is based on a Laboratory Maniac/Alchemist's Apprentice deck I came up with. This deck, however, only needs 4 creatures instead of 5, can be run as either a one-turn-mill offensive deck or a LabManiac win deck, can justifiably run cheap token generation (lingering souls), and should be versitile enough with a proper sideboard to avoid most major shutdown tactics.

Strategy:

Simple. Angel of Glory's Rise to return a Fiend Hunter(targeting the Angel), Cartel Aristocrat, and Selhoff Occultist to the field. Sac the Fiend Hunter to the Cartel to trigger the Occultist, return the Hunter to play with the now entering Angel, rinse, repeat till opponent has no cards in library.

Alternate Strategy:

Self mill with the same combo till all of your humans are on board. Swing until win.

Alternate Alternate Strategy:

Side in Laboratory Maniac. Combo with self targeted. Win. (Given, this requires you to draw, but that can happen with a Thought Scour or start of turn)

Other Notes:

Most of my non-creature spells have Flashback, allowing me the flexibility to target myself with Thought Scour and Dream Twist. Negate, Dissipate, Detention Sphere, Psychic Spiral, and Merciless Eviction all offer decent answers to those annoying cards that cripple the deck (Rest in Peace, Tormod's, Slaughter Games, etc). Lingering Souls offers a cheap front line to block or attack Planeswalkers or highly defensive players. Archaeomancer offers a poor man's Snapcaster, but also does not RFG some of my more powerful control cards, like Supreme Verdict.

I will probably be trying to bring this to my LGS FNM, if I can get it to a point I like by then. Any help or input would be greatly appreciated.

Just went to my first standard tournament recently with a R/B aggro deck. It's mostly red with a splash of black really. [Here](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/redblack-aggro-20-02-13-1/) is my decklist, and I've copied it below too:

Lands:

* 2x Blood Crypt
* 4x Dragonskull Summit
* 12x Mountain
* 2x Swamp

Creatures:

* 4x Ash Zealot 
* 4x Hellhole Flailer
* 3x Hellrider
* 4x Lightning Mauler
* 4x Rakdos Cackler
* 4x Stromkirk Noble
* 2x Vexing Devil

Spells:

* 4x Dreadbore
* 4x Pillar of Flame
* 4x Searing Spear
* 3x Ultimate Price

Sideboard:

* 3x Duress
* 1x Ultimate Price
* 4x Rakdos Charms
* 4x Electrickery
* 3x Slaughter Games

I'm having trouble with the matchup against America, and I'd imagine it would be the same situation against Esper Control.

Seeking feedback.,Shnooker,9,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Magicdeckbuilding/comments/1aai4f/standardbug_adding_black_to_a_simic_11_counters/,"The deck is [here](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/bug-gimmicks/).

I took a [GU deck](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/-simic-gimmicks-/) to FNM last week and went 1-3, losing to a little bit of everything --Esper control, American control, and even a monogreen fast ramp deck.  I was hoping that splashing into black mana would give me more staying power with hard removal like Abrupt Decay and Dimir Charm while at the same time cutting situational cards like Bioshift or Pit Fight.  With the addition of Vampire Nighthawk, lifegain can give me some buffer against faster aggro decks, and I can use Golgari Charm  to answer control decks' sweepers (maybe siding out Simic or Dimir Charms in game 2).

I thought a lot about Corpsejack Menace, but I felt that he didn't give enough board presence as a 4 drop, and even though Biomancer is like that as well, I didn't want to exacerbate the problem.  Especially since if I did put Menace in, I would likely cut Vorapede or have to add in Farseek -- neither of which were particularly appealing.  

Adding Dreg Mangler was also a choice about board presence.  The 3 drop he replaced was Elusive Krasis, who needed to evolve to attack or make a trade when he blocked, and while using Increasing Savagery on an unblockable was hilarious, Dreg Mangler has good Scavenge targets with Gyre Sage, Master Biomancer, and Vampire Nighthawk, and has haste.  Much more immediate board presence.

The Zameck Guildmage and Ooze Flux has fantastic synergy with my Undying creatures, and that focus was carried over from the previous deck.

Also, concerning the mana base in a 3 color deck, is it better to have as many Shocks as possible or as many Buddylands as possible? What's the right balance here? I tried to do some calculations based on the number of colored mana symbols in my deck and make a ratio based on that, should every land be a dual land, or should I include some basics just so that I don't risk land coming in tapped sometimes?

It's doing pretty good on MTGO. Originally I played without Burning-Tree, but the deck became so much more vicious once I put her in. Burning-Tree and an Ash Zealot in hand has happened once or twice, but it's not that bad: I just play my Zealot first and save the Tree for when I can make a bigger impact.

My biggest concern is the SB. I'm not sure what to choose between Pyreheart Wolf, Madcap or Volcanic. Both Madcap and Volcanic can be blown out easily, but Pyreheart always seemed slow before - but that was before I put in BUrning Tree, so I don't know how it will go now.

Bonfire seems like it would be good against these hyper aggro decks, but I still like Blasphemous Act for my Reckoner shenangians. But I may be trying too much with that.

Any input on harvest pyre, dynacharge, brimstone and thunderous wrath? Thanks!

- Ramp with Crypt Ghast. Extort is nice. His 2nd ability is nifty with Mind Grind.

- Ramp with Liliana. Her -6 ability along with Mind Grind is devastating.

- Consuming Aberration is a bamf. Stick a Glaring Spotlight out there and hit for unblockin'/hexproofin' lethal damage **or** throw down an Essence Harvest and make your opponent die a little inside whilst winning the game.

Hey guys. I cam here not really knowing what to expect but maybe looking for general advice to getting started. I started playing the game as the title states a few days ago. I noticed a few friends playing since I travel a bit with a group and they did it so I caught on fast and one of them let me use their deck for a day or so (Red - Goblin, it was very basic but I enjoyed it.) After that I bought a M13 Toolkit, a Fatpack and a few other packs. After that I went out to my local card store to buy a few cards for a Red goblin deck since I knew it best. I bought of course a few Krenko and a few spam goblin cards, with some sorcery and enchantment. White a few bit of white cards in there to compliment the goblin spam. Commander something where X/X is based off creatures in play. Anyways the deck ended up being like 130+ cards plus, cause I just couldn't figure out what to pull and what to keep. I have left it untouched since day two and played with it. It plays pretty alright. Though a day or two I went back after reading and spending a lot of time with friends and have now built a 65 white angel deck. Mostly evolving around Exalted with lifelink soulbounds. I have 4 5/5 angels with flying vig ofc. And the 4/4 angels. With the avatar that is dependent on your HP ETC.


Anyways I find myself rambling. But the people I play with have been playing for a long time. And I ask them frequently what I should do or what kind of deck should I shoot for? Most of the time it goes unanswered while we move onto another topic. Does anybody have any advice for a new starter for a deck to start on? Cards to focus on? Stick with one deck learn some tact? I mean I am looking for scraps here since nearly everybody else around me is flying with high colors and crates full of cards. They all offered to help and said pick out cards and stuff if I would like to use them and what now. But looking through ALLLLLLLLLL THOSE CARDS. I just have no idea what to do..

It's spread in a few different directions, with very few 4-ofs.  I don't think this is necessarily a bad thing, as many of these cards seem to work better without multiple copies on the field (see: frontline medic).

Noteable combos I want to highlight (if possible):

* Reckoner + Blasphemous act.  There's a few variations of this in the deck/SB (Domri's fight ability, magmaquake, stuffy doll)
* Medic + Blasphemous act.  Woah, a board wipe while all my guys are indestructable?  Sounds good to me.  Also works with the charm instead of medic.


The sideboard is intended to deal with RDW and Esper Charm.  For both, side out my early game for additional board wipes/reckoner/stuffydoll etc.  Board wipes hold down RDW well and can get past hexproof to kill even boosted geists.

It seems to run.... *ok*.  But I'm still looking to iron it out some.  I've also been contemplating Ulvenwald Tracker.  What do you guys think?",,False,,t5_2sv87,False,,,True,t3_17io8o,http://www.reddit.com/r/Magicdeckbuilding/comments/17io8o/naya_midranged_standard_please_give/,

Though I understand how powerful cards like Snapcaster Mages are, I've been trying to keep the deck under $100.

What I'd like is a magic target dummy.

For example, an ""aggro target dummy"" would only play for a few turns, but it would let you try out your draws against an aggro deck without having to find someone who owns an aggro deck to test against. Here's what it would do every game:

* Turn 1: Swamp, Rakdos Cackler, Unleash

* Turn 2: Mountain, Knight of Infamy

* Turn 3: Mountain, Searing Spear, Stromkirk Noble

* Turn 4: Swamp, Ash Zealot

* Turn 5: Mountain, Thundermaw Hellkite

* No more plays after this

Hello, I've just recently gotten into deck building and decided to venture into standard with some friends. I have a couple of extended decks, but want to build a G/B deck after being lured into by RTR. For the linked deck, the idea is to use the two artifact rings to get  counters on a creature with Corpsejack Menace on the field. I'm trying to stay under about 40$. I'm not sure if Deathrite Shamans fit well with the deck, as well as the rest of the sideboard. Any advice would be appreciated.

Right now my main issue is running out of cards super fast, and I don't have the cash to drop into Ancestral Recall. I'm sure I could probably run even less lands, but I'm wary of removing the Seats because of their usefulness for Affinity.

A deck based entirely around shuffling an opponent to death. It's awful, but it does what it says on the tin.
[Here's the horrifying abomination on Tappedout](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/everyday-im-shuffling/)

Basically, the deck is packed to the brim with effects that have your opponent shuffle their deck. The win conditions with this deck are one of two:

1. [Psychogenic Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=46582) is the easiest of the two win conditions. The second one hits the field, it starts the countdown. Every shuffle takes your opponent down 2 health, so at that point it's just you trying to get them to shuffle 10 times. Stack more than one on the field, or get out one or more Soldier of Fortunes, and this can burn surprisingly fast.
2. [Cosi's Trickster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=186322) is the backup to Psychogenic Probe. It gets +1/+1 every time an opponent shuffles, so your goal is to pump this thing up right quick. The 4-6 damage per turn you can be doing with Psychogenic Probe could be 2-3 power/toughness growth a turn with Cosi, or, if you're playing it right, it could be both. 

As far as I can tell, the deck basically requires you to get an opening hand of Cosi or Probe (or [Portent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=184661), which is like a Ponder that you can turn on the offensive once you get one of your win conditions out) and then just start the engine of shuffling. 
The All-Star of this deck that is the #1 best engine behind the win conditions is [Soldier of Fortune](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=3182). He's the #1 best engine in the game for forcing shuffling, by far.

The best part about this deck is that it costs about $16. So, you can buy a Geist or whatever, or, you can get the dumbest Legacy deck ever conceived. Whaddya think, Reddit?

So, I bought about 500 cards back in '95, let them sit in my closet up until last weekend upon when I decided I'd try to learn the game. I played a few games with the girlfriend (former card store employee and tournament player) and kinda got hooked.

Having no idea how to build a deck, I went to a local shop, brought my cards in and had them help me out.

After an hour and a half (and twenty five bucks), this deck is the result.

I don't know if it's any good or if it could be considered competitive. I went 3-6 against the girlfriend's ridiculous deck (one being a legit win, two being wins as a result of her having shitty draw after shitty draw). I had a blast playing and would like to someday go to a local event. 

Hoping not to get laughed at at said event, any thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Specifically I love articles that describe the deck list and how to play it and why certain cards are there - recent card examples (I just started playing this year and 90% of my cards are Innistrad block), that give options for other cards you can substitute in if you don't have the specific cards listed, and that are budget-conscious (not based on pricey cards or at least give alternative lower-cost cards).  

Currently I'm just playing casual so I would actually be interested in any kind of deck lists (doesn't have to be standard, just needs to be cheap).  I just have mostly current cards so I'm more likely to already have cards from standard.  

Maybe if there are a few good resources we could even post them in the sidebar!

Lunge is a-m-a-z-i-n-g. 11+ creatures in the yard (not difficult) and five mana means you're taking a grab for the win that'll probably be just fine. Lunge is also great in setting up previous mentioned combo. Gnaw the bone wavers between 1-4 by matchup, as that card makes life points a joke (""gain forty, flash it back, gain forty. 81, go."") and spiderspawning is it's own form of nuts. This deck is absolutely terrified of Nihl Spellbomb. Infect is scary too because they make Gnaw useless, but an easy sideboard. Mill is the showboat matchup.

It's been decent. If I can get creatures out on curve I can usually win with beats supported by brimstone volley.

Thalia rarely lasts more than a turn or two on the battlefield...and if I can make it to one of the angels or Markov it's usually over.

Although, to be honest, the Hellrider has won me more games than any other card and I'm planning to add another one in place of the Neonate.

Edit: Also, why does TappedOut list a bunch of those cards as ""illegal?""

I just started working on my rush of the wild event deck. It's one of the first decks I bought and it is save to say I am pretty new to the game so im not rly sure about the power/combo power of certain cards in the deck. 

This is the deck: http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/rush-of-the-wild-official-event-deck/

I named it like that because as you can see I have not yet changed anything. But I would like to change some stuff.^^ 

First I will start with the cards I wanna throw out:

-Rakdos Cackler: I doubt I will be able to play it on a first or second turn because of the obvious lack of mountains in my deck. Also if I had the choice I would always go with the Elvish Mystic. 

-Gruul Charm: The deck is in general not very good against flying stuff. The Gruul Charm won't change this so I put some of those in the sidedeck and I will just lose game one and then change cards.

-Wrecking Ogre: High cost for 3/3 and also high bloodrush costs. Is this justified by the double strike?

-Armed Dangerous: High costs for what it does. 


Do you agree with these cards being not the best and also not being essential for the deck strategy? 

Now the replacements: 

-Savage Summoning: I was thinking putting this card in the main deck maybe also more than once. 

Annihilating Fire: Maybe also more than once. Of course I have to pay attention to not putting to many spells in. 

Wild Beastmaster: Because its an essential card for the deck I think only one copy is not that much. 

I was also thinking about adding more copies of Rubblebelts Raiders Pyrewild Shaman and Ogre Battledriver. I have to watch out that the avg. mana cost is not too high. Also I thought about putting in 1 or 2 additional Burning-Tree Emissaries to get it to ramp harder. 


Would be nice if you could give me some advice and just say what you think. 

Thank you.

* Hymn to tourach and gatekeeper of malakir are absolutely the best cards in the deck. I can easily win games just by playing one hymn. 

* I am happy with the win conditions, which are desecration demon and lashwrite + skinrender/gatekeeper.

* I consistently hit a great curve topping off at 4. It is hard to hit 5 lands by turn 5 (which is fine with my curve.)

* Black Sun's Zenith actually isn't as good as it seems, because I need to get to 4th turn for it to be very effective and it isn't good against thopter foundry or with my gatekeepers and skinrenders

I play standard constructed (as does he) so I understand how to play magic on that level. EDH seems so fun and I am excited to get to play with some older cards! I must say having such a huge selection of cards to chose from feels pretty overwhelming.

After looking at many option for a general I have taken to [Doran, The Siege Tower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=140201&amp;type=card) for mine. Since I know very little about EDH deck building and strategy it is hard for me to evaluate the strength of a deck when looking at a list.

To start, I wanted to ask if those more knowledgeable could link me to some strong EDH decks with Doran as the general. I am not looking to net deck but I am looking to get an idea of a good functioning deck. I learn by example and this has always helped me. Budget is an issue for me, so perhaps some examples of budget ones that are strong but could be upgraded later on would be best for my needs.

I also wanted to ask for some EDH rules of thumb. Things I should keep in mind while playing, deck building or evaluating cards that may not be the same when playing standard constructed.

Any additional information is also very much appreciated. Thanks so much to this community for your help, I look forward to my new addiction!

Something I've noticed over the past few weeks is that almost nobody plays the kind of control that dominated at my old LGS. In fact, of the 30 people or so that go there, only 1 or 2 play control at all. Coming from a LGS where you're lucky to go a single match without seeing at least 2 Supreme verdicts, this was a big change, and got me thinking.

I started playing early in the RTR block, and my first real deck was a BR vampires deck. I stopped playing it at the old place because those colors had no real way to deal with all the board wipes that were played, and I needed to get my lords out to really get going. Now that I don't have to worry about verdicts all the time, I want to give it another go. So, yesterday I grabbed the old deck and touched it up a bit, ending up with this.

http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/crappy-vampires-part-ii/

My only real concerns with this is that it lacks the degree of removal I'm used to, and that the curve is weighted a bit too heavily towards the back end (even though it caps out at 4 drops). I also briefly considered throwing in 2 Blood Barons, but I didn't want to push the curve even farther back and didn't know what I would take out for them.. The goal- By turn 6 or so, have a bunch of vampires pumped by Lord of Lineage, Vampire Nocturnus, and Stromkirk Captain.

I've seen a fair few flavors of bant pop up now and then lately including bant aetherling, prime speaker bant, and other variations as well. 

To my mind, the current main reasons to play bant are the following:

Thragtusk

Supreme Verdict

Aetherling

Farseek

Sphinx's Revelation

These seem to be the essentials, with aetherling being a 2x, farseek/thragtusk being 4x, and verdict/sphinx's being at 2x-4x.

Supporting cards include garruk relentless, garruk, primal hunter, azorius charm, selesnya charm, snapcaster mage, advent of the wurm, voice of resurgence, loxodon smiter, augur of bolas, sigarda, jace, architect of thought, plasm capture, detention sphere, syncopate, dissipate, angel of serenity, acidic slime, progenitor mimic, restoration angel.

Matchup considerations:

Aggro: Farseek into Verdict is obviously great against many aggro decks. Azorius charm is good for stalling, while thragtusk and loxodon smiter provide good ground support. Augur of bolas can provide card support while putting off 2/X attackers. Both selesnya and azorius charms handle ghor clan well. Usually one of the better matchups.

Reanimator: Syncopate/dissipate are good at permanently handling unburial rites or hardcast creatures. Selesnya charm is also good to have when they do drop large reanimatables at instant speed. Thragtusk helps to keep up with lifegain while you hunt for aetherling. Usually not a great matchup, but the sideboard can help a lot with purify the grave, rest in peace, and ground seal as options.

Jund: Sigarda and aetherling are very reliable win conditions against jund. Loxodon smiter helps handle discard effects, which can hurt a lot otherwise. Verdict is a good way to handle when they drop threats like olivia and huntmaster. Counterspells are generally effective later in the game to handle garruk and thragtusks. Garruks and Jace are both effective.

Aristocrats: Supreme verdict is good against cartel aristocrat, skirsdag high priest, and boros reckoner (depending on which variation of aristocrats). Thragtusk is still a force. Jace, architect can put off a lot of their attacking power with his +1. Selesnya charm and azorius charm both hand varolz well.

UWR Control: This matchup can often be an aetherling race. Cards like thragtusk, farseek, azorius charm, selesnya charm can provide some tempo advantage during the race. Cavern of souls can help to resolve aetherling. Advent of the wurm, loxodon smiter, and voice of resurgence can provide early pressure to tie up their resources during the midgame. Jace is excellent against assemble the legion. Sphinx's revelation is necessary for keeping up with card advantage.

Some notes...

Supreme Verdict: useless. I never casted it once if I had it in hand. If you need it in this deck, you're probably already too far behind and it's become a desperate move.

Trostani: WHAT A HOUSEEEEE. She got so much work done it was insane.

Sigarda: A bit disappointing.

***MVP***
UNSUMMON: That card did so much work in tempoing my oponent out of being able to kill me, making room for attackers, setting them back turns, etc. And I would still probably take it over Az charm because its cmc1, but some testing may be required there too.

Overall, the deck performed to my satisfaction. It only lost to a weird esper spirits extort with a reaver in it.

Moving forward, I think I'd run the following 75:

1370134394.0,4,self.Magicdeckbuilding,1fhsqr,[Standard] AEtherling Control Budgeted ~ UPDATED,Orzhov,6,2,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Magicdeckbuilding/comments/1fhsqr/standard_aetherling_control_budgeted_updated/,"http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/therling-control/

Feel free to ask me anything about the deck/matchups!
First i would love to see what anyone would change with this deck.


So I've gotten to play at FNM and a free tourney for standard with this deck.  FNM I went 3-1-0, losing in the last round to a R/B aggro that got me too low before i could stabilize. When i played it, i did not have terminus or the 1 of Sphinx's. I instead main boarded 2 Oblivion rings and Gideon, and some of the negate/dissipate/essence scatter/render silent were different (i did 2 negate and 2 essence for main)  Overall i feel it plays the same.

MATCHUPS:
Matchup 1: 
was a UWr control (the same as found on star city that won on sat i believe) ~ This was an easy matchup, he was well prepared for any aggro which i did not use, and since i run 4 aetherlings, i ran out out and let it get countered.  That gave him ease and he tapped low thinking i would not have another.  I played a land and won from my second one easily.  The second game i knew his board and what I was playing and boarded in my 3 dissipates and 2 negates, and out my board wipes.  Same scenario, i won from AEtherling quick enough.

1-0-0  (2-0)
Matchup 2:
A weird enchantment deck using about 33 enchantments, 24 lands/land ramp, and it was an extort/mill deck.  I managed to top deck my o rings and detention spheres to get his main enchantments (keeping me from attacking without paying like 20) This was the case both games.  Thought game 2 took way less time.  

2-0-0  (4-0)
Matchup 3:
Golgari, uhh stuff?
It had lilliana and viraska, some discard and some draw.
This match was creature light on her behalf, and after she dropped a descecration demon and had it azorius charmed twice i took a nice lead in my mana need.  I was able to drop an aetherling with 2 mana open and she was doomed as per usual. Second game, she managed to ULT her lilliana, (my mistake i had an aetherlingout and wasnt paying attn) and she seperated into my 1 aetherling, and my lands. I kept the AEtherling, and next turn laid a land, and was able to squeeze it out with aetherling without her having mounted any creature presence.

3-0-0 (6-0)
Matchup 4:
Short but sweet, he just had a ton of hasters, and first game, i had 5 mana but only one white, holding a supreme verdict. Likely wouldve had an easy win if that had been used on turn 4 or 5 (i didnt miss a land drop)  Game 2 was similar however i did get a supreme off, but he managed to topdeck a few spike jester or 2, and i missed my land drop to get to 6.  By that time, i was at about 5 life and he just closed the game with another haster i believe a falkenrath aristocrat.

Overall i think i had great matchups for me, though the rakdos i was less prepared for. If he had been a blitz deck where its just wastes its hand in the first 4 turns i wouldve easily won but this round he sandbagged a little knowing i couldnt do a ton.

a TL;DR for the free tourney is: (this is with what the deck is now)
round 1: forgot a planeswalker could ult. He did such and won from 8, 6/6 tokens.....i was in the driver seat until then and had i taken that out it was an easy win. 0-1.  
Round 2: boros aggro. easy pk. similar to naya blitz, but less hasty. Not a bad match, just hit a verdict/ terminus.  2-0 game.  
Round 3: BUG zombies?  recast gravecrawler and such.  I was able to keep him at bay, and grab 2 lotleth trolls with a sphere and run the games from there. 2-0  (overall 2-1)
Round 4: Junk reanimator
This was the hardest.  Found my deck to be horrible against it, even if i had had rest in peace.  Game 1 he acidic slime my gate (i missed a drop and he turn 3'd it) then 2 resto angels made it a short game.  Similar for the second. (0-2) overall 2-2

TL;DR ~ Very fun deck. Has a 70-30 good match ratio i think.  Needs some tweaking, but for a fairly budget deck it is amazing IMO.


EDIT(s):
Please ask me about any suggestions i make and a deeper reasoning.

If people were to make this into an even more competetive deck that is not QUITE the norm, there are a few things that I would personally recommend.

First of course is mana: Remove the guildgates and add Glacial fortress'/hallowed fountain.

Second: Add snapcasters (2, 3 or 4) and remove thought scour's/a detention sphere/1 aetherling. If this is done negates and dissipates/etc must be kept up, unless you have a DSphere, incase they drop a planeswalker, since this has NO removal for that other than the sphere of course.  The snapcaster element helps with the tempo-ing of it, and of course give you a great deal of control around turn 5-9, when you dont have enought mana to drop an AEtherling.  These turns can be VERY crucial in this deck, when you might be low on cards, and don't have a sphinx's rev (will discuss later) or you do but for 2-3 is a small rev (sometimes needed, again will discuss)

Third:
Sphinx's Revelations is an amazing card. If you are making this a very strong deck less budgeted, this card is amazing. I think 2-3 is a viable amount.  You dont want to have too many high drops in an opening hand.  This is when the number of aetherlings can be lowered to 2, i think!  The way i have used this is that if board control is made at 6 mana, and u are running 4 aetherlings (prefereably if u have another in hand/vary by matchup) drop the aetherling.  Most decks using aetherling are waiting until 7+ mana, usually 9 (to hold a negate and a blue for exile)  I say this is doable because it is a threat, you force them to take it out that turn, which is many times using a lot of mana and gives u a free turn (remember only if board control is stable!)

-2 aetherling. -1 detention sphere, -x thought scour. -x Lands (with gates).

+2x sphinx     +1 ?????                 +x snapcaster.     +x dual lands


Piloting this deck:
Based on what i have it is fairly simple.  ur first 3-4 turns are used for hitting thought scour turn 1 on urself (if u have 4 aetherlings) and cycling that into a free card basically, and maybe milling a think twice/feeling of dread, which is basically a free card in ur hand too.  turn 2 is for either scatter (maybe a burning tree), if no scatter and playing heavy aggro use a dread, or an end turn think twice.  turn 3 is either a flashback on dread or think twice or again, holding a scatter/dissipate.  Make sure you hit your land drops. if you are playing a slower deck its a LITTLE less necessary (i generally kept if i had 2 and a think twice/thought scour/az charm) turn 4 is usually a verdict, or let them over extend and hold a feeling of dread and let them get mad and keep dropping creatures thinking 'ill get thought eventually'. turn 5 thereby can be a verdict. Following turns can be tempo-ing and taking small damage, stay above 4 life, no boros charm/helix/ spear+pillar.

Be patient. Be patient.  Analyze the plays, know what each can provide them. know the matchup.


Things i found:
JUND: tl;dr-you can win, easily
Thragtusk is annoying but the life gain isnt sh*t for this deck. the token is the only iffy part. Based on cards in hand and ur life dissipate or dont. 
The sphinx's rev isnt a requirement of this deck. if its too costly, skip it and find something else that fits ur style. if u own a tamiyo run that instead.
Falkenrath can be a problem. Scatter worthy ususally, unless they have nothing to sac and when its ur turn you can kill it. generally just do it, dont waste the mana if its available.
Huntmaster is not too bad, the 2 for 1 they get can be kept at bay, then removed.
Usually ive found jund is a few turns back, hoping their cards can 1 for 2 yours, you can do the opposite or at min, 1 for 1 (its kinda a bad spot for them. its slower in my opinion, and if u 1 for 1 them, they fall behind slowly due to that slow fact.)

ARISTOCRATS: tl;dr can be tricky as f*ck.
This is a very board based play matchup.  know what u are playing. know what they can do and what will kill you.
lingering souls. problematic to say the least. dissipate if u can usually. they can sandbag it, if u sphere the tokens they get them again (or they sac the 1 you target and u wiff it)
blood artist: based on the board state let it hit or dont. dont let it if there are a lot of tokens, that way u can rath without losing 5 life.
falkenrath aristocart: again its all board state. if no sac outlet, its going to hit you for 4 (or azorius charm).  dont let it hit the board with sac outlets. or sphere it.

JUNK REANIMATOR: very hard matchup imo. 
If they are going for a turn 3 acidic slime, you are doomed. tap down the mana dorks at upkeep and keep a dissipate for that or the unburial rights.
the angel...: it will not get anyhing on your side, hurr durr, but u dont want to restock their hand.  it is can easily be the biggest threat. 5 damage is hard. restocking them with 3 creatures, horrible.  it doesn't need to hit! It may outrace you since you will likely not be at 20 health.
lotleth troll: ha....ha.... azorius charm it, nothing more. its not a huge threat. let them get it big.
unburial rights: well clearly this is a hard one. based on graveyard. it is dissipate worthy. watch out for it on a turn 4-5 angel, getting them a tusk, slime, and resto or so.
obzedat. this is a game loser really.  You cant do anything unless they attack with it, unlikely!  you cant outrace it... if they unburial rights it you will die before and aetherling can kill them off.

UWr control (close but different mirror)
you can win. their burn is not enough to kill you. they get dead cards, you dont. go ahead, helix me, spear me, pillar me, just be smart when dropping the aetherlings, if they tap out for a sphinx, go for it. they have no removal that is truly scary against it. you should have 7 mana,  no rush.
warning, dont let them drop a assemble the legion/jace. thats about it.  Sphere it if so. you should have them they have nothing else you would ever need to do that to really.


EDIT 2:
The sideboard is NOT worked out. it worked for me, but i think the matchups were that cause.
Renounce the guilds is amazing. if you side board it, TAKE OUT DETENTION SPHERE! DUH
Negates: needed imo, mirror control decks u need this.
Oring- maybe needed- if u board renounce, board this for planeswalker removal and spot removal
nevermore- this is certainly iffy. its socrery speed. bleh. if you are terrified about 1 card, or u have a mirror match, nevermore that card (NOT AETHERLING). Sire of insanity. sucky. obzedat. sucky. this is not a needed sideboard card but it can be helpful. oh and that pesky slaughter games....yea....scoop.  
terminus. those pesky indestructible cards....screw em.

The idea here is to put down a border post every turn, ideally suspending a Greater Gargadon turn two and a Riftwing turn three. Then, turn four, play any of the cascade spells and cascade into Restore Balance. You'll have no lands or creatures on the field, and so your opponent will be forced to sacrifice any he/she has. From there, try to get out March of the Machines and swing with your Borderposts, cascading into the last two Restore Balances as necessary. If you have lands you want to get rid of so your opponent will have to sac theirs, just sac them to Greater Gargadon while it's suspended. If they manage to make some lands stick, Ajani deals with them nicely.

I'm not quite at the point where I can get multiples of my favorite cards.

http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/whitegreen-creature-flood/
The main idea behind this deck is to get as many creatures out on the field as possible. I have a few heavy hitters to ""bring the noise"" as well. Here is a link to a full deck.

As you can probably imagine, I usually play Vorstclaw or similar heavy hitter in combination with Fungal Sprout. Once that is on the field, my opponents feel quite a bit of pressure. After that, I try to get out Crusader of Ordric and Goldnight Redeemer. If I still have Roaring Primadox, I simply bounce my Goldnight Redeemer for it's life gain.  It doesn't take much after that, if I still have quite a few tokens on the field. 

I noticed that this deck is designed for a longer game, So I decided to make another one to quickly take out opponents by just avoiding their defenses most of their defenses. Creatures usually have flying or intimidate. Sorceries and instants are mostly ""deal X damage to target creature/player"" or ""tap target creatures""
