The single mod of /r/FIFA13 isn't interested. He has, in fact, banned users today for even talking about /r/FIFA. I doubt the line up of mods who've grabbed up /r/FIFA14, /r/FIFA15, etc are going to be as inclined to play nice either. 

I'd like to see the mods of /r/FIFA get on this, too, as we thought they would...but they don't seem very active even as we celebrate the release of a brand new addition to the franchise this week! No real changes have been made to this sub to make it seem like the place for the video game.

But a lot of people see the good that it would bring a community to have a one stop place for all things FIFA the game. Others who don't mind migrating won't take long to convince that everything will be okay once they see how awesome it can work to grow as a community and stay solid together.

In previous discussions, I offered /r/EA_NHL up as an example of how it can work. I also created /r/EA_FIFA months ago in preparation of rolling up my sleeves and helping out. However, the community overall said ""Let's do /r/FIFA and let it become a video game subreddit"" so I locked mine up. 

As you can see, not much has changed. We're all scattered still. 

So, to the community that decided they wanted to not keep sub-hopping: 

**Is there an interest in creating a very specific subreddit for all of the EA Sports FIFA series similar to /r/EA_NHL? One that will be active and implement even a few things that help bridge a community together? For OTP, Club, FUT, Tips, Tricks, News, Videos, FIFA13, FIFA14, FIFA15 and beyond?**

If so, I will work on getting /r/EA_FIFA up and running. 

If we want to make that place /r/FIFA, that's okay too. But we need the inactive moderators step down and let those who want to make this happen, make it happen. 

*So, what are you thinking?*

Well I spoke to the mods and there is disagreement as to the purpose of this subreddit. There is somewhat of a desire that this subreddit be available for FIFA tournaments (e.g. the world cup). 

As we can't come to an agreement as to the purpose of this subreddit, and as im the only actual active mod, i'm going to recommend that you all subscribe to /r/ea_fifa if you havent already done so. The mod/creator shares my vision of having one subreddit to cover all the fifa games (so people dont have to change subreddits every year) and seems to have already done a wonderful job of setting up the subreddit.

There's a lot of drama behind the scenes too, apparently, things between mods and mods and those who've grabbed subsequent FIFA titled subreddits from here until /r/FIFA24 and probably beyond.

I call an end to the bullshit. 

*We're going to just let it all go, my friends. Let's wipe the slate clean and start anew. Leave behind the drama and the hurt feelings and weirdness and the angst and let's build our ultimate team in a centralized subreddit and get back to our love of the game.*

_____
After playing for a long time in Div 1, I recently had an issue with my XBL account that forced me to start back over in Div 10. This trek back up the Fifa ranks gave me the opportunity to observe the different playing styles and ability levels of players in different divisions. What I found was that the two MAJOR differences between Div 1 players and Div 3-5 players are:

* 1. Clinical finishing
* 2. Not Beating Yourself

One of the big ways players tend to beat themselves is on Goal Kicks. In this tip, I'll explain why Goal Kicks are so important, and break down exactly what to do on offense and defense to make Goal Kicks a strength rather than a weakness in your game. 
________________
The goal kick may be the closest thing to a positioning ""glitch"" in Fifa 13 as it puts the team taking the kick at such a disadvantage. So much can go wrong. If the kicker attempts to pass to one of the CBs or FBs at the edge of the box, a quick forward can intercept and create an immediate scoring opportunity. If the kicker attempts to boot it up field, there is often a mismatch between the kicking team's smaller attackers and the team defending's bigger, stronger CBs. This can lead to a quick counter with a powerful header from a CB to a forward leaving the team that took the kick's defense out of position and chasing. These against the run-of-play scoring chances can change the game and should always be avoided. 

So what do you do on a goal kick to maintain possession and avoid easy giveaways? Here's what most of the top Div. 1 players I've seen do. 

Chip it to the full back. That's it. Don't boot it. NEVER pass it along the ground. Chip it to the full back. If your taking the goal kick from the right side, chip it to the RB on the right sideline. If you're on the left side, chip it to the left back. 

This method has proven to be the best way to maintain possession off a goal kick without the potential of giving up scoring chances. The chipped pass is much tougher for the defending team to cleanly intercept and create a shot, and if it is intercepted, the chip allows your defenders time to get back into position and defend. 

If your opponent decides to defend the fullback, you can play the fullback open by how hard you hit the chip. 2 bars power will put the ball over the fullbacks head, allowing him to run on to it. 1 bar power will put it in front of the fullback. If you feel especially threatened, put 3 bars power and just kick it out of bounds. 

On the other hand, if you are the team defending the goal kick -- ALWAYS be proactive. Make sure if the kicker attempts to make the short pass to his CB you'll have a player there to intercept and quickly convert. If the kicker tries to chip it to his outside back, have a player out there harassing. 

Fifa 13 can be a tough game with often small details determining the difference between winning and losing, promotion and relegation. Using this goal kick tip will help you avoid giving up easy goals while cashing in a few of your own, helping you get that much closer to that elusive League Title.

*No, no, don't get up. We're coming to you!*

1. It begins with my taking a moderator position at /r/FIFA, which has already happened. 

2. In the next few days, I  will work with the CSS and basically bring all that we have at /r/EA_FIFA to the /r/FIFA layout. This will include user flair for your system and gamertag/ID and link flair for FUT posts.

3. I will be setting the AutoModerator loose on /r/FIFA. This should assist in filtering some of the spam and other negative content and help with overall moderation. As usual, you should still report anything that isn't caught... or anything that got caught that shouldn't have disappeared!

4. When it's all done,  /r/EA_FIFA will remain intact. **However, users will no longer be able to post in /r/EA_FIFA after August 11.** That's the kill date. Some might come over sooner, but expect a bit of a jump in activity by then.

The reason for this is the following; users had found a way to exploit a glitch which allowed them to get as many starter packs as they wanted. Of course, they just kept exploiting it, generating huge amounts of rare players. In addition to getting great players, they discarded all the non-rare, which gave them a profit of between 5-10k coins for each pack they were able to get.

When EA became aware of this issue, these users started panic selling many of the players they had acquired. In order to get rid of them as quickly as possible, they put them up for a very low ""buy now"" price. There are stories of Ronaldo's, Messi's, etc. being sold and bought for around 5k coins.

Now, the most hardcore UT community is split. In one camp, there are those who demand the whole system to be reset. Their arguments are that this exploit has ruined the UT economy for the rest of the year, as top players will be relatively common and therefore not worth much. In addition, the glitch has given several players an unfair advantage, as they were able to benefit by exploiting it themselves or by being lucky and at the right place to pick up an amazing deal. On the other hand, others claim it is unfair to those who have acquired players by legal means to lose them again. 

Since there was also a substantial amount of coins generated through this mechanism, the consequences for the UT economy are unclear. It is possible that rare players will be cheap from the beginning, something most UT players might be able to live with. It is, however, also possible that since a select few users are hugely rich, the absolute top players will be so expensive that they will be unreachable for the rest of the community. Since the ""wealth inequality"" between the top 5% and the rest is currently so large, chances are that they will only compete amongst each other for the absolute best players.

Anyway, I wanted to start a discussion on this subreddit on what you guys think. If you feel like reading up a bit more, there is plenty being said on the official [FUT13 Forums](http://forum.ea.com/uk/forums/show/133.page). I must warn you, the workings of the forum are far more primitive than Reddit, and the same can be said about the average user.

**TLDR edit: Users found an exploit, generated large amounts of packs for themselves. Consequences for UT economy are unclear - it might make players very cheap from the start, or increase the relative value of extremely rare players. Many users are calling for a complete market reset, which would mean that everyone loses their progress so far, including the players from their starter packs.**

______________________________________________



1. **User Flair:** The user flair has been wiped and will now be specific to your console and gamertag/ID instead of country. You can edit your user flair via the sidebar. Choose your console, insert your gamertag/ID and hit SAVE.

2. **Link Flair:** This has been enabled to differentiate posts about FUT from posts about other game modes. If you submit a post specific to Ultimate Team, please use the *flair* option under the title to tag it as FUT after you've posted. The AutoModerator bot will assist in tagging if you forget, but please make an attempt to do so! It's important for feature #3!

3. **FUT Filter:** On the sidebar, you now have the option to change the mode of r/FIFA. **No FUT Mode** will eliminate posts about FUT if you don't want to see them. **FUT Only Mode** and **All Content Mode** should be self-explanatory. This has really helped those who don't care about FUT not get lost in the mix!

4. **Subreddit Chat Room:** Many readers of /r/EA_FIFA have been making use of IRC to connect with other players, arrange matches, or just talk shop. This service has been provided to us by the awesome people at /r/Quakenet. You can even [join via webchat](http://webchat.quakenet.org/?channels=Football,r/FIFA) if you'd rather not install a client!

5. **Twitter:** You can [follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/RedditFIFA) if you'd like to stay up to date by alternative means. We will be broadcasting posts from /r/FIFA using hashtags so that other players (and maybe even devs) can discover the community.

6. **r/FIFACareers:** We're not planning on getting the community spread too far out, but we wanted to make mention of /r/FIFACareers as a good community for those of you that play Career and Manager Modes. All posts related to this are still allowed in /r/FIFA, but if you're preference is these alternate game modes -- we suggest you check them out as another good source of information.

I've gotten bored of FIFA 13 really quickly due to seasons, so today I decided to spend all of my coins on packs, considering it's TOTY. So, I started with ~ 1.05 million coins, and now I have around 2.5k. 

The best player I got (value-wise) was Pirlo or UP Turan.

That's ridiculous. I'm not angry and I'm not ""fed up"" because I wasn't going to do anything with the coins anyways, but if I open 1 million coins worth of packs I should get something decent. EA should raise the card weight on good cards. The market is so overpriced, and the seasons rewards don't make up for that. Ibrahimovic is an 88 rated player and on Xbox right now (when most of them are listed due to TOTY) there is only around 70 of his regular card. For a couple million players, that's not good enough.

I know that the ""economy"" of FIFA is supposed to be expensive, and they tax and reduce card weight as to not inflate prices and flood the market, but I just hope that FIFA 14 can be a bit easier to acquire good players. 

I'm a decent trader and at my peak of my coins I had around 2.5 million, but I've spent all of that and can barely make 100k back. What do you guys think?

(P.S: I tried to make this not sound bitchy although I'm guessing it does. I just think that one of the main reasons UT is not as exciting or fun this year is because of the pack chances and the ridiculously bloated prices of rare players.)",,False,,t5_2qxh7,False,,,True,t3_1epu2d,http://www.reddit.com/r/FIFA/comments/1epu2d/they_seriously_need_to_fix_the_market_in_ut/,

What lounge mode should have is the ability to track player stats and head-to-head records. It could also have injuries and form and such, but that might be more complicated. 

What doesn't need to be there are those stupid ""trick shots"" (or whatever they were called) from, like, FIFA 08), or any random gimmicks that aren't actually a part of playing.

    and that you are wanting 9 chemistry (which you should be)  
  
Right. Let's say your player is a centre back - [Chiellini, for example.](http://gyazo.com/fe70c14c8879fa95f2889ef5eeda2210.png)  
He has four links:  

* To the LB  
* To the GK  
* To the CDM  
* To the other CB  
   
If you want him to get 9 chemistry, you have to give him 4 'points'. One for each link.  
Here's how to get points from the players he's linked to:  
  
* For 1 point - someone from the same league  
* For 1.5 points - someone from the same team  
* For 1.5 points - someone from the same nation  
  
[Here, he gets 0 chemistry ](http://gyazo.com/72faecd59478ab18aba6db378fabbdaa.png)because he has no links with any of the players.  
[Here, he only gets 7 chemistry.](http://gyazo.com/e39bc4d21e63a90d50d226964e5c3dde.png) That's because he only has 3 points - 1.5 from both the LB and GK because they're from the same nation.  
[Here, he gets 9 chemistry ](http://gyazo.com/640fabd1d73fa2061d55a27893062c32.png)- despite having three red links - that's because De Ceglie is from the same league (1), the same nation (1.5), and the same team (1.5).  
1 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 4.

1.  How do MLS teams stack up?  I'm a Sporting KC fan and would love to plan my squad, but if I'm going to be at a significant disadvantage, I'd stick to an easier team, at least at first.  

2.  Is online play well rated to pit me up against other noobs, or am I going to be getting my ass handed to me every other match by veterans?

3.  Are the players fairly well rated?  I understand it is purely based on statistical ability as it would appear on paper, but does a playmaker actually provide that set-up like they would in a real game, or is that mostly something the player has to control?

4.  How do the different ports compare to each other?  I'd probably play on PS3, but I could do PC if it were much better.

One of the biggest things about this game that absolutely drives me up the wall is how players that are in close vicinity to a free ball DO NOT GO TO THE BALL, something all players get drilled into their head by coaches beginning at age 5. Instead it seems the game will default 1 player (sometimes, though rarely, maybe 2 players) to 'lock in' to a ball instead of just having whoever is nearest to a free ball to go to it to try to contest possession.

This replay I saved of an UT game I was playing earlier perfectly shows what I'm talking about: http://www.ea.com/uk/football/videos/ugc/155118001

I have the ball at the top of the 18 with a striker up near the penalty spot, and a winger that is streaking in on a great run on the opposite side of the 18. I see my winger and attempt to pass him the ball to hopefully setup an easy 1-time shot, unfortunately I can't get FIFA to recognize clearly who I'm trying to pass the ball to (another GIGANTIC complaint I'll have to save for another post, as I have noticed the computer misinterpreting passes more often in the higher difficulty modes as a way to artificially make the game more difficult), and instead end up passing the ball to my striker who proceeds to take an off-balance shot that gets blocked by a defender. 

This is the point where I proceed to want to throw my Xbox out the window. My winger who has just made a great run into the box, watches my striker shoot the ball off the defender and the ball deflects somewhat up in the air with no one in a clearly winnable position to make a play on the ball... instead of crashing towards the deflected ball to try to score like any normal living organism with a working brain, he proceeds to stare at it and backtrack away from the ball while you see both another defender and the keeper make their way to the ball to try to gain possession, which they eventually do. The video cuts off before you see the other defender waltz in basically uncontested and clear it, but you can clearly watch my winger stare at the deflected shot, and even though he is about the same distance away from the the free ball as both the keeper and other defender (if not closer), he mindlessly trots AWAY from the ball, all the while I'm frantically trying to switch players to him to manually force him to go to it, but really had no chance from the beginning because the computer has already forced his movement away from the ball and effectively removed him from the play.

This situation happens to me MUCH too frequently. Anytime there is a free ball up for grabs, the surrounding players nearest to the ball that have any chance at all of winning possession should ALWAYS go to the ball. Period. End of discussion. But for some reason the game uses some sort of algorithm to determine who can 'lock in' to free balls instead of just forcing the players nearest to the ball to go to it like you would see in a real game. To me, this should be such an easy thing to program into the game, but instead the 'locking in' system is used instead. Additionally, the lock in system appears to be (in my opinion) favored to select defenders over forwards to lock into free balls in an attempt for the game to make it more difficult for people to score. I don't know if this is just FIFA's attempt to provide more balance to attacking vs. defending, but watching players who are close to the ball and have a great chance of winning possession just quit and make no attempt whatsoever to contest possession is absolutely infuriating.

**TL;DR - FIFA should program all players nearest to free balls to GO TO THE BALL instead of defaulting to the typical 'lock in' system the game uses, as it creates maddeningly unrealistic behaviors from players who are near free balls, but instead ignore them**",,False,,t5_2qxh7,False,,,True,t3_1buyta,http://www.reddit.com/r/FIFA/comments/1buyta/fifa_programming_for_me_leaves_a_lot_to_be/,

_________________________________________________________

This play is so simple and so effective I'm not sure why everyone doesn't do it. Here's how it goes: 

When you're defending a corner kick, you will usually have the bulk of your players in the box and **two defenders** near the opposing player taking the corner. Of the two players nearest the corner taker, the player closest to the **goaline** is usually a full back, and the player **further up field** is usually an attacker. 

Select the player further up and send him up field along the sideline as high as you can. Ideally, this player will be at the midfield line on the edge of the field that the corner is being taken from. 

When the corner kick is taken, direct your players to head the ball to your full back that should be near the player taking the corner. When the player near the endline receives the ball, have him send it up field (through ball, cross, chip through ball) to the player you've sent up field. 

The up field attacker should receive the ball with no defenders around him, resulting in an immediate 2v2 counter attack. 

I've scored more goals off of this simple maneuver than I can count.

If there was such a thing as a perfect piece of software (or hardware) then we would not have things like an OS crashing, word documents missing, or Neuer heading a ball towards an opposing attacker in the box instead of catching it. In any software, big or small, there will always be errors that the programmer/QA tester/gameplay designer will oversee. EA (contrary to popular belief for some) doesn't put out a broken game on purpose, it's because the code/game has been stressed to certain quality standards. If these standards were set to ""perfect"" we would A) never see a new iteration of FIFA, and B) the game that did come out would be outdated/not revolutionary.

Did anyone see the Celtic - Barcelona game from a while ago? It finished 2-1 Celtic with the winning goal being from an 18 year old teenage striker beating Victor Valdes. A game in which Barcelona dominated all of the stats, except the most important one. Statistics give us a pretty good estimate on how players perform in a real life scenario, but it does not always dictate how they will always play when actually dropped on a pitch. 

I personally play with a Russian squad in FUT and come up against teams that on paper would destroy my team. However I'm almost always a better player than they are because I rely on my play style to help me win, not solely on my team. Someone might have Hugo Lloris on their team and think he's an unstoppable goalie, but even he is human and will let in a few (or 10) in a match sometimes. 

With FIFA there must be that mentality of ""It is only a game, and after the Xbox/PS3/PC is turned off all of the negative energy stays in the game, not in me.""

So I started at Wimbledon, got transfer to Roma after the season.  That's cool and after 3 seasons we've won everything.  I want to move on, but only the same couple of teams I don't want to go to keep bidding for me, no other team seems interested although I'm destroying the game (I'm not playing on hardest difficulty yet and sticking to semi-pro for now, still getting used to football games since I haven't played since FIFA 2000). Only bids coming in are:

- Athletico Madrid every damn transfer session. 

- Sometimes Real Madrid

- PSG

- Wolfsburg

- FC Porto

- Bayern have made a bid or two. only one I was even tempted by.

six months after I moved to Roma, Aston Villa and Dortmund also gave it a go, but back then I was only just settling in Italy.  Can I issue a ""come and get me"" plea to any team? I kind of want to go to the Prem but not even big money come to get me (I'm worth 25Mill and on the transfer list). Is it because I'm playing as an Austrian? Is it because I play as a forward and every team already has enough? Does that limit my possibilities? Doesn't really make sense since I'm beasting and feasting...  Where can I check how much time is left on my contract so I can leave on a free, if that's even possible?

Other things: will they stop saying it's my debut for every cap? I've won a European Championship, I think it's time to accept I'm a regular. In general I find everything that happens off the pitch in this game very weird. Can I even find out what formation my manager is playing without approximating what is on my pitch radar?  Sometimes I don't even know if I'm left or right forward...

Last thing: any tips on how to get the weak foot volley achievements? It's hard enough to get volleys as it is.

(GAME ONE) I win 16-1 as soon as i git my first game i divsion one
-  My players are always in the right positions, always great first touch, always score (its hard not to) Good defence work and Neur does great stopping afew shots

(GAME TWO) the same all my players feel great and my second game into the season on UT! Win 7-1

(GAME THREE) I Lose 7-1 at home ( 5headers from REUS)
Not only do I lose im literally trying my hardest and this is what i feel, 
- Players iq and positions sucks
- Midfield does not run back and actually moves away from the front of defrence
- MY CBS turn to Jelly and cannot win! 
- FIVE HEADERS FROM reus is just silly
- My main cb for a conrer stands outside the box
- Strikers First touch is not there, which makes my pacey strikers nothing

Right this is not just me having a rant but this happens Over and Over again does anybody have this?

Its like after I win a few games ea is like ok you need to lose now!

The main point is I can actually feel when my players dumb down, there touch doesn't work, I know sometimes that I just cannot win a game!

What are everybody else experiences on UT and are they like this?

1375095519.0,12,self.FIFA,1j9pvb,Which stats are taken into consideration for card stats?,Pimp-My-Alpaca,18,6,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/FIFA/comments/1j9pvb/which_stats_are_taken_into_consideration_for_card/,"So, I was messing around on chuzzz, attempting to put my career mode team into an UT format but I wanted to put their card stats on as well as the overall. So I went to futhead and had a little look at the stats of my 4 test subjects: Reus, Messi, Vidal, Chiellini.

**Pace -** 

This should be the easy one. Just (sprint speed + acceleration)/2. However it is not so.

      |Reus | Messi | Vidal | Chiellini
:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:
Card Face (CF) Pace | 90 | 93 | 80 | **80**
Sprint Speed | 88 | 92 | 80 | 76
Acceleration | 92 | 95 | 80 | 82
Supposed Pace | 90 | 93.5 | 80 | **78**



So, here we can see that while most of them are right, Chiellini's are not. Next player I looked at was Kompany's, which was 1 off too. So I decided that I should look at a different stat.

**Dribbling -**

This was harder, I wasn't too sure what should go into the equation. I was confident of ball control and dribbling, but after looking I assumed that Agility should go in to it as well (Not balance, Zlatan has 37 balance but 87 dribbling)

      |Reus | Messi | Vidal | Chiellini
:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:
CF Dribbling| 84 | 96 |**82** | **53**
Dribbling| 86 | 97 | 82 | 52
Ball Control| 79 | 96 | 84 | 54
Agility | 89 | 94 | 76 | 60
Supposed Pace | 84.333 | 95.666 | **80.666** | **55.333**

So this time it was half of the players wrong. And i can't think of another stat that could balance this. For example, Chiellini needs stats that are lower than 53 so that his CF dibbling to get this back into proportion. His only stats that are lower than 53 are, dribbling (already counted), finishing, free kicks, positioning and vision. None of these would make sense to count in to dribbling.

I really couldn't be be bothered to check other CF ratings

As of this I have come up with three possible answers

1. There are numbers that multiply each stat relevant to that topic. E.g. Dribbling is more important than agility when it comes to the CF dribbling, so it is multiplied by 1.6 (made up number)

1. Each CF rating is different for a position - makes next to no sense

1. EA can't do basic maths - unlikely as surely they'd have an algorithm for this

I find myself playing this game less and less because I cannot play a few games without getting dropped from the servers.  Way too many times have I been in the lead with a good run in Div 1 just to get dropped, counting as a loss and lowered DNF%.

**So here's my idea:**

I understand that if the game recognized you are winning, dropped, and still gave you the points that this can be exploited.  Users will score their first goal, disconnect, and count a win for a fraction of the effort.

At the very least instead of having utilizing a method that completely screws the player, just have the game not count.  Simple as that, you've got to play that game again.  It's much better than losing points, DNF% and getting penalized for something that's not the user's fault.  Not to mention conserving our contracts that go to waste on these occurrences.

In a single Division 1 run I've been dropped from two winning games, one even while checking the match facts.

I know posting this won't make much difference but it definitely cooled me off a little.  FIFA induces enough anger **without** the terrible servers.",,False,,t5_2qxh7,False,,,True,t3_1bjpw6,http://www.reddit.com/r/FIFA/comments/1bjpw6/my_suggestion_to_ea/,

I'm a serious player(emphasis on player, it is a game). 89 CAM, pass first, playmaker. I'll let my play speak for itself.

Philosophy is key. I'm so fucking frustrated with pro-rank matches, and clubs who have absolutely no buildup, and lack tactics. Piracy FC will not x-spam, and counter-attack to infinity like juveniles. That's for pro-ranked, rookies. My philosophy is UNSELFISHNESS. Joga Bonito. Work the ball in the box. Keep possession, pass and move, with fluid movement. Open lanes and beat offside trap with 1-2 passing. Tiki-taka when opponents try extremely high pressure traps. Smart, high pressure defense including mids to recycle possession and unleash deadly counters if appropriate. Maintaining at least 60% possession will lead the way with creative players who can open up chances, and smart defensive tactics.

I need players who:

* Don't x-spam 
* Pass 
* Know when and how to create chances.
* Play their position
* Active  
* Mature (*Prerequisite*; Puberty)
* Did I mention don't x -spam, and pass?


This is a brand new club as of today. So patience is key. It''ll take work and time.

Please PM me if you're interested. No better place to start than reddit.

* whenever his comes into the Menu screen, everyone with a mic goes ape-shit and starts yelling for him to get out, but he never does.  He waits until the last second to pick a side, and if he doesnt get his desired position as any, he just sits there until everyone leaves, and then continues to cause havoc on pro ranked matches for a good few hours every day.

4.  No one cares about the long ass intro or the player subs.  

5.  Let me rematch at end of match.  Also, at end, dont make me wait until other player presses A to exit.  Why am i trapped watching players walk off field?

The CAM is an integral position in any FUT team. It provides the striker(s) a player to play off and gets someone in between the opposition's midfield and defence. It is my experience that a CAM is VITAL for someone who like to play a quick passing style.

The question is what makes a good CAM?

In my opinion the stats that need to be focused on when using a CAM are:
Agility and acceleration to glide past defenders and open space
Long shots- the CAM will often find the opportunity for a long shot as the defenders try to track the run of the strikers 
Ball control- a good CAM needs to be able to keep the ball close and get the ball under control quickly
Vision- for those OP chip through balls
4+ star skills help but are not necessary
Traits: long shot taker, speed dribbler (helps but not necessary) 

The best CAMs will have a rating of 75+ in all these catagories. A quick search reveals what you would expect. Players like silva, nasri, boateng etc. top the list.

But who are the most undervalued CAMs in FUT.

1. Renato Augusto- 1200
2. Matias fernandez- 1500
3. Samedov- 600
4. D'alessandro- 1200
5. Thiago Neves- 900
6. Emanuelson- 800
7.Vieirinha- 800

These players meet the requirements to make a great CAM while being very affordable. Give them a go and you will not be dissapointed

2. All players are able to score incredible long shots, I've played lower standard teams and it just seems soo many players can score screamers now, which to be honest takes the pride out of scoring one.
3. Through balls are just as easy to pass with, i don't think its harder to defend i think its easier to score, same old same old through ball and score. 
4. Okay this is just my annoyance at constantly playing Gold Brazilian teams, i'm so fed up with playing against Luiz, Hulk etc and they just through ball it and score screamers which makes point 2 and 3 worse.

Kevin Mirallas: http://www.futhead.com/fifa/players/4408/

Thierry Henry: http://www.futhead.com/fifa/players/59/
-Surprised to see a legend here? Well I'll have you know that despite his card stats, he STILL IS legendary in FUT 13!

________________________________________________________


PKs can be excruciating. At times it will seem like you never guess the right direction. PKs can frustrate players to point of completely losing their mental edge. And shootouts? Losing a shootout can put anyone on suicide watch. So what's the secret? The secret is to take your head out the game and trust the odds. 


**PKs**

Pick a side right now. Left or right. Chose one. From now on this is your side. Every time you get a PK, whether you're taking the kick or playing goalie, you go to this side. If you miss it, oh well, the odds will come back to you eventually. 
This simple tip has allowed me to be a much more level headed player and not think myself out of matches. When my opponent blocks it, it just rolls off my back, but the majority will go in because going the same direction every time put the odds in your favor. 

**Shootouts**

Shootouts are a bit different because an intelligent opponent can eventually catch on to your game. I haven't lost a shootout since I don't know when. Here's the shootout secret. 


On your first PK, go the OPPOSITE direction of your chosen PK direction, then, on the next four, resume going in your chosen PK direction. 


For goalie, when blocking the SECOND PK, remain in the middle. Other than that, resume diving in the same direction. 

That's it. Enjoy your Fifa. ",,False,,t5_2qxh7,1361545549.0,,,True,t3_18zug3,http://www.reddit.com/r/FIFA/comments/18zug3/the_secret_to_penalty_kicks/,

I switched to 4-3-1-2 then after getting busquets and song I figured they'd be better CDM's then got modric and fabregas figured they'd be good CAM's so I went 4-2-2-2.

Thought asking here so maybe someone who knows what I'm talking about could help me out here, maybe some people who didn't know about it could find out about it too, because it really makes a difference for me if you play 3 or 6 minutes a half.

Thanks!",,False,,t5_2qxh7,False,,,True,t3_zvpeq,http://www.reddit.com/r/FIFA/comments/zvpeq/looking_for_the_tooltweak_to_change_half_time/,

Why would EA think we would prefer facing a 100 Chemistry, Full Gold Brazilian Squad with our &gt;40 Chemistry Bronze squad, in Div 5 (the lowest/starting division mind you)? 

It just boggles my mind. 

Do all of you agree EA just let shit hit the fan with this? 

Do they give a shit about what we want and what we don't?

Are all of you as pissed as I am?

P.s if you are one of those Brazilian Gold Squad pace whores in the lower division purposely doing this, well you're just a very bad person v.v

Context : Faced 5 full gold squads in Div 4. All pace whores. Against my shitty bronze squad. LWLLL

Now I am in danger of being relegated. 

Edit 1 : 

**My likes about the new system :** 

I do like the system of having divisions, yes, it gives you an objective. You have to get to Division 1, and when you win divisions you get coins aswell. Superb, way better than last year, where you just played with no real ""league"" or ""win/loss"" objective in mind. 

The design is nice, everything is accessed easier. 

**My dislikes about the new system :**

Can't see the rating of my opponents teams.

Pace whoring is still a pain in the ass for us financially poor players.

In lower divisions like Div 5 and 4. There are full gold squads. It's like a scenario where Barcelona have been put into the Npower league. 

**What I wanted to see in the new system :**

Less pace whoring.

Kits numbers could be changed.

Customised formations.


I haven't tried anything else besides ""Online season"".

If the other modes could help me, do tell.

I will post this here to explain the rules and to those who are interested just send me an email to- 

Fifa13season@yahoo.com 

The majority of players and the league will be hosted in Eastern Standard Time. If you have questions, concerns, or notice any errors or loopholes, you can send it to the league email. Some structure will be added/changed based on the number of participants. Looking for a dozen or more players, first come makes first entries. 

Table of contents 

1. Draft system 

2. Who are the Draft-able players 

3. Rights to players 

4. Schedule 

5. Game results 

6. Yellow cards/Red cards 

7. Forfeit system 



1.)Draft system; 


I plan on entering everyone's name in this website (http://www.random.org/lists/) 
-This helps randomize a list of names I enter. The randomizing will be Frap'd if requested and posted on youtube, so everyone can view the draft online. 
-The draft will take place 1-2 days After game release.&gt;&gt;&gt; (Negotiable)&lt;&lt;&lt; 
-The results of the list will show the order of draft picks each round. This will work like the NFL. For example, if Scott gets the first spot on the list, he gets the last pick in the 2nd round. Continues to alternate until the end of the 8th round &gt;&gt;Negotiable&lt;&lt; 
-Once the draft order is decided, I will make a Fifa '13 season facebook group, and make a thread called ""Fifa Draft"". Then, the draft will be done by the order in which the list chose. For example, if Scott is the #1 pick he will be the first to comment with the name of the player he will be drafting, then so on etc. etc. until the first round of drafting is completed. 
-Once you drafted a player, you CAN trade them for picks. You can only trade what you own. Trading periods will be held after each draft round. I will make a post called ""_ round trades"". This process will be simple, you propose an offer to a person, and there's simply an except or decline reply. 


ex. I want Joe's #1 draft spot in the second round. I drafted Rooney first round. I make a comment in the ""1st Round Trades"" post like this 


Brian- @Joe My Rooney for your 2nd round draft pick? 
Joe- Yes 


He now owns the rights to Rooney, and now I have 1st pick in the 2nd Round. 


2.) Who are the Draft-able players; 


This won't be too hard to explain, so this section is short. 
-Draft-able players will only be holographic gold players. NOT LIMITED to this image&gt;&gt;&gt; 


ex. (http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-g-i_CSpRRyM/T7wmlF97laI/AAAAAAAACiI/uhM5Au23oWo/s1600/MOTM+Orange++Players.png) 


-All player regular gold or below will be free for all to use. 


ex. (http://i.ytimg.com/vi/yc5-3NcvB-g/0.jpg) 



3.) Rights to players; 


Whomever you choose to draft, you have the rights to that player. 
-whether you choose to play the player you drafted or not, nobody else in the league can play that player. 
-You can have multiple drafting strategies; Do you want to draft to counter your biggest threat or draft to make the best team you can? The decision is yours. 



4.) Schedule 


Our season will run with the same fundamentals as the champions league but instead of a qualifying round, everybody makes it to stages. 


(http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=2013/competitionformat/index.html) 


-Depending on the number of participants, I will make different groupings. I can go into further detail once we decide on who is participating. 
-Before assigning people to groups, we will have a skeleton of groups already pre-determined. 


ex. Group A.- Consists of Player B, Player D, Player H, Player L 


-To randomize different groupings, I will again place everyone's name in (http://www.random.org/lists/), then starting from the top you will be labeled Player A, Player B, Player C, Player D.....etc. 
-After assigned your letter, you will be placed in your predetermined group. 



5.) Game results 


After a game is played, both players will take screen shots of match facts and emailed to Fifa13season@yahoo.com. In the email, your headline will state the date you played, your team letter and opponents. You will attach a screenshot of the match facts with score. The text of the mail will have the score and red/yellow card summary. 


ex. Subject: 10/1 Group A: TEAM A vs TEAM F 


4-1 Team A. 


Messi- Yellow 
Pepe- Yellow 


-It's your responsibility to produce the games based off the calendar on time. (which will be made and shared to keep the season on track.) 



6.) Yellow/Red Cards- 


Yellow/Red card tracking will be tracked based off the honor system. 
-It's your responsibility to keep track of who will have to sit out in-games. It's too much information for my admin and I to keep track of. However, if you decide to cheat the system and get caught, your next 2 matches will result in losses against your opponents. 


7.) Forfeit system 



As a result of a forfeit, a score will be equated based on your previous win. 
- Take your score from your most recent win and apply it to the game your opponent forfeited. If you do not have a score from your most recent win, then apply the score of your next win. 
- The player who forfeited the match receives a score of 0 on the forfeited match. 


Ex. in game #1, Scott beats Brian 4-3. In game #2, Christian forfeits due to no-show. Scott wins forfeit 4-0. 


This system was developed so players are not punished for their opponents forfeiting. On the contrary, players who forfeit will not be punished more than a loss because sometimes rl is more important. 


FAQ 


-Q: When does this season start? 

A: 1 week after release date. 


-Q: I wont have enough coins to buy my drafted players by the time the first game comes, what do I do? 

A: Mostly everyone will be in the same boat. That's why all regular gold players and lower are free to anyone. To forecast, I won't see any draft picks til mid/late season. 

-Q:How long do we have to play our scheduled games? 

A: 2-days to decide on a time on the calendar and play against your opponent. 2 day period is implemented so the group stages can proceed on time. A calendar will be made, for example; you will be inclined to have your game played between Oct 2. and Oct 4. Everyone will create google accounts and we will share a google calendar that illustrates the league schedule. 


-Q: If 2 days pass and my opponent never played me what happens? 

A: You refer to the forfeit system. 


-Q: What will we be playing for? 

A: Coins. The first season buy-in will be 5,000 coins. Buy-in's will be made prior to the Drafting process. Buy-ins will be logged in google docs for all to see and will be traded to League Host ""GsO BriGs"". If for some reason the season is canceled, Buy-ins will be returned. The second season will/may be increased. 


-Q: Who gets the winnings? 

A: First place receives 70% of the winnings; Second place receives 30%. 


-Q: What about injuries? 

A: Injuries are too frequent in Fifa, nobody will be punished because their kaka card is a *****. 


-Q: Will the good people be handicapped? 

A: No there is no handicap system 


-Q: The way the drafting system is, its going to be nearly impossible to get a perfect chemistry team, why this way? 

A: It works both ways. You can sacrifice the top rated players for a mediocre team with players nobody cares for. Everyone will be making sacrifices and will have teams that will sometimes be a little random, but your free to use any regular gold cards too to help balance them out.

I'm in a data analytics class, and I've done visualizations on real life stats, but thought it would be interesting to look at FIFA statistics as well ;) 

If you play a game, and you have nothing else to do- submit to this thread any format that I can record:

**A. Player Name**
**B. Games Played** 
**C. Goals**
**D. Assists**
**E. Game Result e.g., win, loss, draw**
(*if you sub someone on, that is considered a full match played*)

Also, don't only record people who tally points for the game, so if Radamel Falcao plays 2 games, but doesn't get a goal or assist in either, still include him as such:
Radamel Falcao, GP 2, G 0, A 0

*  Only the five major leagues (Barclays PL, German Bundesliga, French Ligue 1, Italian Serie A and Spanish Liga BBV; just to keep the data more compact.

Of course this is entirely for fun, and data accuracy is appreciated (i.e., don't say Wazza scored 15 goals in 1 game, although I'd be impressed).

I would like to enrich the dataset before I do anything with it, as most understand you can't do anything meaningful with a thin dataset! But after I'm done, if anyone is curious to see it, i'm always okay with giving it out of course haha, just ask

One thing to note! If you play as an International team, please let me know. I would like to keep, ex. Argentina - Messi, separate from, Barcelona - Messi. :)

Thanks to anyone who gives data :p,

I'm totally new to this formation, and from the release of the game I was intrigued by it due to my playstye. I played a BBVA squad in FUT12 with 4-3-3 and loved the wing play, but I always find myself wether in career mode or online, playing teams with wingers who can cut in and shoot/pass.

4-3-2-1 seems perfect for this with the LF and RF, being wide enough to skill/cross balls in, or cut in for the shot. My main concern really is that I've not seen it a whole lot and I'm wondering if there is any particular reason for this? I also love playing with CAM's, of which the BBVA has many, but I just think the RF and LF are so nice for me and a ST up front that it's bound to work.

I bought up a new squad last night and it is as follows - Diego Alves (gk) Coentrao (lb) Pique (cb) Pepe (cb) Jao Pereirra (rb) 3xCM - Fabregas -Alonso-Ozil, Iniesta (LF) Benzema (st) Di Maria (RF)

Now I'm almost exclusively in the English Premier League, but a few overalls have stood out to me. 

One being Tim Krul. He's a 79 overall, non-rare, where his fellow countryman Vorm, is an 81 overall rare. To me it doesn't make sense. Krul started the last World Cup qualifier for the the Dutch, and is the starter for a much bigger club. Does that always matter? No. But most of the time, bigger club means better keeper. Not only that, but Krul started over Stekelenburg (82 overall, rare) not Vorm. Meaning Vorm is the 3rd keeper for the Dutch, yet Krul is the lowest rated. 

Staying at keeper, is Lloris. Transfer for Spurs that is 86 overall, rare. He has 90 diving and 91 reflexes. This makes him two points better than any other keeper in the EPL, and madly expensive at the moment. His he better than Cech, Hart, Krul, De Gea, or others? Well he could be, but we haven't seen much of him yet in a spurs shirt. He didn't even start today against QPR. 

Overall, I feel as though a lot of these overalls are poorly done. Either too high or too low. Some changes I'm fine with, and they make sense. But some don't. Tempted to present it to EA, but realize it would probably be ignored. Would love to hear your guys' thoughts and any other players you feel are off. Especially outside of England. 

EDIT: I sort of forgot to mention that I almost exclusively play Ultimate Team. As a couple of you have said, this clearly wouldn't be as much of an issue if I was playing career mode or H2H outside of UT. Match Day is a great feature that definitely helps maintain the overalls, but unfortunately, its a bit different in UT.

So I go on with the last game of the season, and luckily a really bad team gets sorted against mine, the team had something like 21 chemistry, it was really awful. I start to think ""Yes, once again division 1 is mine!""

The match starts... And he immediately quits. I am struck dumb, speechless, stoked. True justice: the result is a loss for me (WHY?!??) and, because of some unsporting asshole, I lose division 1 for a silly reason.

This was the most difficult season ever, some matches had been really hard for me...

My idea for Fifa 14 or 15 is centred around Career- Manager mode, but could be extended to online play as well.  I am fond of this idea because I would imagine that programming this onto the existing framework wouldnât be too difficult and it would significantly enhance the game.

**The idea:** Introduce a leveling up model in Manager mode that incentivises players to start their career mode with poor quality teams and build up their profile and career. 

**How would it work:**

* Players start as an unknown manager.  They can choose to start at a small club or a Barcelona or an Arsenal.

* As managers successfully meet their objectives and improve their teams, they are awarded bonuses or 'Skills'.  These Skills are awarded based on a number of factors.

* The factors determining the 'Skills' awarded will include the quality of the team, the style of play, the achievements of the club and the management of the squad.  For example:
Quality of club: performing fantastically with a lower tiered club, like winning the FA Cup, may give you greater Skill capacity than winning the Champions League and La Liga with Barcelona.  This encourages players to select lower tiered clubs to build their reputation and then move to the big fish.  It also makes sense intuitively.
Style: Or playing a possession strategy successfully may give you Skill bonuses relating to passing and vision of players.
Achievements: the bigger the achievements the faster you acquire Skills.
Management: the more successful you are in managing the transfers, morale and growth of players, the greater your Skill bonuses would be in those areas.

* Some Skills earned may be tied to a particular club, however most Skills are tied to the manager and carry on to wherever they move.

* Skills may also be lost based on bad performance.

* *IMPORTANT:* the player as the option of carrying on their career or resetting the timeline so that their achievements are not lost.  E.g. If you start by managing Portsmouth for five years (2013-2018), and at the end of your successful run are offered the opportunity to join Barcelona, you have the option of starting with Arsenal in 2013 and your achievements with Portsmouth being back dated, i.e. recorded as being between 2008-2013. This is to avoid the problem of âageingâ of players and losing the opportunity of playing with the current best players because you started with a lower team.

* Every other club has managers like you, with their own particular bonuses.  So for instance, Mourinho would have a particular Style of play and Bonuses that would move with him depending on which club he moves to.  This adds a further layer of depth and unpredictability as good teams with excellent managers may become very difficult and vice versa.

**Skills:**
So the Skills awarded to managers could come from a wide range of areas:

* Attacking, Mid-field or Defensive Skills - e.g. A Vision Skill may give all your mid-field players a boost of +5 to their vision, or a Finishing Skill may give all your attacking players a boost to their Finishing ability
* Morale â e.g. Never Say Die Skill, where your team gets a boost of morale in times where you are losing in the closing minutes of a match.
* Transfer market skills â e.g. A negotiator Skill may give you the upper hand in buying players for cheap
* Management skills â e.g. Fostering Skill would enable a manager to get more rapid growth from his youth players.

The possibilities available are too many for me to list, but to me itâs clear how much depth it can add to career mode.

**One Additional Feature**

I would also make a change to the growth system FIFA uses for its youth players.  At the moment, there is no advantage to holding on to players in their 30's, why not just invest in younger players.  This dynamic can be changed by having experienced players affecting the rate of growth experienced by younger players.  All of a sudden you have a reason to keep experienced by declining players as oppose to selling them off before they lose their market value.",,False,,t5_2qxh7,1360579666.0,,,True,t3_18aws1,http://www.reddit.com/r/FIFA/comments/18aws1/ea_fifa_career_mode_improvement/,

I go up with another Zlatan goal, 3-2 and I think I'll win. Nope. He scores. 3-3, FT.

Second Game: I go up 2-0 with both Zlatan goals. He comes back with 3 goals, 3-2. He scores again, 4-2. I already was getting ready to put a loss down for me. But I scored a couple minutes later, now it's 4-3.

What happens next? Elmander. 90' goal. We go into the 2nd OT now. And nothing happens until the 59'. John Terry goes to clear-NOPE. Own goal. 1-0.

Zlatan twists his knee. He's done. I'm fucked. But he stays in because it never showed the injury icon. I go up in the 86' and score with Elmander, game over. 9-7 AGG. To Sweden.

1349251786.0,6,self.FIFA,10v6nk,Some FIFA problems I've noticed - from a FUT Online Player. ,mxray,8,2,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/FIFA/comments/10v6nk/some_fifa_problems_ive_noticed_from_a_fut_online/,"I'm a long time FIFA player, and I've noticed some problems/annoyances that occur during online play. I've played about a hundred games online, have a great serie a squad (http://www.futhead.com/fifa/squads/98791/#), and consider myself a decent FIFA player (atleast in FIFA 12, I won D1 H2H several times). 

First I will highlight the 2 that are the most frustrating to me. 

**--- First ---**

There are 2 types of players that I face online.

1. Players with similar level teams
2. Players with clearly worse teams

When I play group 1 teams, I have a great time in the game. Scoring isnt frustrating, defending isnt frustrating unless I'm too aggressive, and the better player wins. I consider myself a good fifa player and I end up winning a majority of these games, with the occasional 1-2 point loss. 

When I play group 2 teams, one of 2 things happen. What happens rarely is that the player is trash along with his team and that leads to a blowout by me (this has happened maximum of 4 times). The rest of the time the game is extremely challenging. To get a win, which is VERY rarely more than a 1 or 2 point win, I need to play absolutely flawless. A majority of the games however I feel like the opponents team is boosted in some way. All of the bounces go to their team, the tackles come easy, and if they have a pacey team they destroy me. I pass the ball and it goes too far/too short to the wrong player, and it gets intercepted.  I have lost at least 15 games by 4+ goals, and zero of them have been against a team at my star level. 

I think that there is some kind of handicap present or something going on that makes a teams crosses, passes, shots, and defending lackluster when playing a much worse team that knows what they're doing. I'm soon going to create a squad with the best 78-82 level players I can find/afford and test this theory. 


**--- Second ---** 

This happens mostly during the happenings of my last paragraph, and was mentioned on a post over at /r/ea_fifa this week. When you are on the front third of the pitch, it often seems like its 10 versus 5, and you are always being swarmed with defenders. I feel like unless I pass it immediately, my only options are to move away from the goal, or sprint across the pitch with a defender right on my tail, needing to pass. Only about once a game will a player on my team make a run where he is not completely covered by a defender or have a passing lane, and give me a good chance to score.  This really only occurs during the above ""handicapping"" I've noticed, and has ruined the offensive side of the ball for me. 

**--- The Rest ---**

The other things I've noticed in-game or read online that I also have been experiencing are as follows (**please add more in the comments and I will add them**):

* Finesse shots are shit. A finesse shot goal occurs by either team about once ever 5-7 games. I do think that it was overused in fifa12, but in this game its extremely difficult to get one to work. Besides the shots to get around the keeper or from very close, I've only had 1 finesse shot that went in from farther away (a beauty from walcott that has utterly failed every time i've tried to replicate it). 

* Knocking it past the keeper is much much harder to do and often fails when done correctly. More on this in 2 bullets.

* Sometimes when a defender is running towards a player from behind that is clearly slower (I used to have mertesacker - 32 pace - and ive seen it done with him), they will go into an animation where they somehow catch up and tackle you from behind. More on this in the next point. 

* When a fast striker has been given a through ball or has a breakaway of some sort, unless the striker is 90+ pace they are if its 1v1 versus the keeper and there is a defender on your tail, you must shoot the ball before you reach the keeper. In the skills games it says the 2 ways to beat a keeper is to knock-on past him or fake a shot and go around him. If you try a knock-on, 45% of the time the keeper with either easily grab it, 45% of the time the defender will magically catch up to you and tackle you, and 10% of the time the it will be effective. Fake shots are impossible as it slows you down too much and the defender will get the ball 90% of the time. 

* There is no momentum in 13. This is something all over the EA forums and I've recently begun to notice it. After scoring a goal, I don't see any real increase in performance by my team. In fact, after some goals I see an increase in my opponents performance, and same in mine after an opponents goal. 

* The last problem I had is one that only I have been having, and I might be doing something wrong with headers, but when I have an attacker that is smaller than the defender defending a cross/corner, and I try to head the ball, most of the time the player tries a diving header towards the goal and comes no where close to the ball at all. In previous games they at least attempted to get in front of the defender and it occasionally worked, but for whatever reason I'm having my players whiff completely. 

Anyways, even if nobody agrees with this it was a good stress reliever for the past few games I've played, and I'm procrastinating from some work so whatever. I didn't proofread this shit so maybe nothing makes sense and if so im sorry haha.

I think that the way your team performs is directly linked to the rating (probably chemistry too or whatever) of the team youre playing AGAINST.

I have this 70 rated american team with 95 chemistry that I play with, as Ive shown here before.  When I was in the lower divisions Id frequently play with people with squads that were similarly rated or worse.  I have jozy altidore as a striker and he was playing great and scoring almost a goal a game for me.  Then I play all gold teams and it looks like hes never played a game of soccer in his life.

Then I move up in the divisions, constantly play all gold teams (not even with good chemistry, I don't think it means as much this year) and just get demolished but cheaply.  Like my defense plays terribly, none of my players go on good runs, etc etc.  Like the AI is just bad.  I have my team in offsides trap but they never hold their line (i don't know the proper terminology).  So I've just been getting super frustrated.  Especially because the entire time, my team has been improving rating and chemistry wise (well not exactly rating because I had a bunch of gold players on my bench that I got from opening packs that I just never bothered to move off until Id get an american replacement).  Morale has stayed high, I never let it dip much.  Ive actually kept my players more fresh with subs that I could rotate in and out and using cards and stuff etc.

So then my last game I play a team that's bad on paper, mostly bronze not good chem.  And I win 4-1 like I should.  But how I won was interesting.  My AI players played impeccably.  They played the offsides trap great and weren't making blatant mistakes.  The players would make good runs on the attack.  I scored maybe my 2nd goal ever with landon donovan, scored off a corner, and scored 2 goals with Jozy Altidore on the attack.

So my theory is, that your teams performance doesn't stay consistent as your competition varies.  If you play a team that's better than you, you're players will play 'dumber'.  This is completely faking it to me, and ruins the satisfaction of trying to build a team (which they already ruined by giving me more gold players than I had all of last year just for fucking booting up the game and doing some shit).  

If you build a team you should expect their play to stay consistent and let you win or lose based on your own skill as long as you keep their chem, morale and fitness the same.  Just because some asshole has half of barcelona as their FUT team, your defenders shouldn't all of a sudden start running away with their back turned to an attacker in the box that has the ball (which ive witness a bunch). It feels fake, it feels cheap, and its frustrating.

So when I'm logged into my xbox live gamertag, the loading screen won't go beyond the black screen between Rooney's kick and the menus. The loading icons appear and then nothing, just black. The guide button on my controller won't even bring up the in-game dashboard and even if I press the physical power button ON THE CONSOLE, it won't turn off unless I forcefully turn it off (hold it down for 5 seconds).

The weirdest thing is that it works perfectly if I start up the game without an account logged in or with my brother's gamertag! Also, I can start the game with no account logged in then at the menus I can log into my account and it will work fine.

What's up with this??

tl;dr - Obviously there's a clash between my gamertag and the game loading beyond Rooney's cameo at the title screen. Any similar experiences?

He has very crappy dribbling and passing and doesn't fit into the possession oriented 4-1-2-1-2 bundesliga squad that I play which requires the strikers to drop back. I should have realized that before I bought him because that's not how he plays in real life.

As for biggest surprises. Kevin Grobkreutz. There is a noticeable lack of Left midfielders in Bundesliga and I got him mostly as a placeholder but he has been great for me. He is a really solid all around player and if I am holding the ball near the top of the box he often comes flying down the right wing and either gets an assist or a nice shot on target that has a high percentage of scoring.",,False,,t5_2qxh7,False,,,True,t3_10wikk,http://www.reddit.com/r/FIFA/comments/10wikk/who_are_your_biggest_regrets_and_biggest/,
