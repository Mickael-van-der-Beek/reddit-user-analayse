So, I'm trying to wrap my head around the FFT algorithm. My goal is to read in a coefficient vector(representing a polynomial), and transform it in O(nlg(n)) time. So far I understand what a dft is, and how to get it(in O(n^2)). As far as I can tell, the fft works because there are repeating expressions in the roots of unity for even and odd roots of unity, however when I write them out I fail to see any repeating patters. My book says that a given root of unity is: e^((2*pi*i*k) / n) for k = 0 to n-1. However on the web I've seen all these examples where they neglect the k, which makes no sense to me. My book is the third edition of introduction to algorithms in case anybody is wondering.



I sort of understand what a recursive fft does. Recursively breaks the vector into even and odd indexed coefficients(so two vectors total, one with the evens, one with the odds), until the vector lengths are 1, in which it retuns that value. I don't understand why this works, reminds me a lot of merge sort, but I can't grasp why breaking it into evens and odds works here. I don't understand the rebuild step whatsoever, where it loops from 0 up through n/2 - 1, I'm definitely going to need somebody to explain that part.



So, could somebody who understands the algorithm explain to me first why it works, and second what is happening in the recursive solution. Please explain like I'm 5, I can't stand these terse explanations on the web. The reason I want to understand it is because I need to write a recursive FFT algorithm that works for polynomials bounded by an n that is a base 3 number, rather than the traditional base 2 solution.


Thanks, if you guys need me to explain anything more just ask.",,False,,t5_2qj1c,False,,,True,t3_1ad3x7,http://www.reddit.com/r/algorithms/comments/1ad3x7/explain_the_fast_fourier_transform_algorithm_like/,

Transactions can only be done between two individual people, so like (creditor, debtor, amount) would be a transaction.


The output is to find the transactions needed to settle the debts and do it with the least number of transactions.

Example:

A owes B 10

B owes C 10

C owes D 10


The optimization here would be that A pays D 10 dollars.

But remember, that many people can owe one person money. And that one person can owe many people money.

I tried think about this as a graph problem (each node is a person, directed edges are transactions) and then if the inward and outward edges values are equal, this person has net zero and doesn't need to participate in the transactions.

Actually, to be honest. I'm somewhat confused how to approach this problem. I feel like this is some sort of graph algorithm problem? Maybe something related to flow-cut problems? Would like some pointers.

I have a sequence of (possibly repeating) variables, for example:

    a b c d a e

I want to assign each variable a *distinct* integer (&gt;= 0) such that the sum of differences of adjacent variables (plus the first variable) is minimal. In the example, I want to minimize

    a + |b-a| + |c-b| + |d-c| + |a-d| + |e-a|

One solution to this instance would be `a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4, e=0`, turning the sequence into

     1 2 3 4 1 0

with the optimal value of 8. Assigning naively by just incrementing is not optimal and would yield `0 1 2 3 0 4` with a value of 10.

Does this problem ring a bell for anyone, i.e., can it be reduced to a known optimization problem? Does an efficient algorithm exist to either solve this or approximate it? 

The only algorithm I can come up with is trying all possible permutations of [0, 1, ..., N] (with N being the number of distinct variables), which has a horrible running time of O(N!).

xi) % of embarkments that occur at floor i

yi) % of disembarkments that occur at floor i.

r) Average number of people who join in on the party per unit time. (unit time can be something like the time it takes an elevator to move one floor). You can assume it follows a discrete probability distribution (Poisson).

1) A seller (you) is given a list of n buyers. 

2) There is only one of each bottle of wine. So m total &amp; distinct bottles altogether.

3) Each buyer has 10 wines he/she desires (there might be the same wines in different lists). 

5) You can only sell to each buyer once.

6) You have the options of picking which bottles of wine a buyer receives. So he/she may receive 3 (minimal) through 10 bottles, depending on your inventory remaining.

7) Some customers might be left empty-handed if the remaining inventory does not satisfy their list (i.e a minimal of three bottles to an order).

Objective: Your goal is to maximize the number of wine sold, or minimize m, i.e. your inventory. I presume this is a combinatorial optimization problem, and since I have not formally studied this area, I'm stumped on a good solution. Any suggestions on an algorithm to use?

EDIT: 

Also consider run-time of the problem.

Example:

  m=14   

  Buyer 1 wants: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

  Buyer 2 wants: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12]

  Buyer 3 wants: [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,13,14]

If all 10 wines of buyer 1 was processed first, then buyer 2 and 3 would not be able to place an order to minimize m.

A permutation of the optimal solution would be:

  Buyer 1 receives [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]

  Buyer 2 receives [9,11,12]

  Buyer 3 receives [10,13,14]

Anyway, for one of my classes we have to build our own implementation of Conway's Game of Life.  

I'm assuming this is a popular enough concept that I won't have to go into it, but if you're unfamiliar with it, [check out it's wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conways_Game_of_Life), it's not really all that complicated.

So one of the main parts in implementing a solution is counting the live neighbors a cell has, which is necessary in order to determine the state of the next generation. Currently I've implemented this as a 2D array of bools to represent the state of the cells, and I'm iterating through each cell and just incrementing/decrementing the x/y indexes by 1 in order to get the state of the neighbors and keep count. That means that for each cell, I always have to check the state of 8 other cells (except for margins) in order to determine its live neighbor count.

I'm assuming this is the predominant solution, but also that it's not the most efficient way of doing it.  

I've thought of a different way of doing this that I think might be more efficient, but due to my lack of knowledge in calculating the expense of an algorithm, I was hoping maybe somebody more knowledgeable might be able to tell me if that is the case.  

Now my second implementation requires the use of the same bool array representing the state of the cells, but also the use of a second int array that would keep track of the live neighbor count. It would loop through the bool array and whenever a true value is encountered, the coordinates of its neighbors would be calculated, similar to my previous solution, but they would be used to increment the ints in the second array which keeps track of the neighbor count. If the current index in the bool array is false, then it is ignored and no neighbors need to be calculated.

One reason why I thought this might be more efficient is due to the fact that only the neighbors of live cells need to be calculated now. However, the use of a secondary array and the constant writes to that array might also make it slower than the first.

---

My problem is as follows. We have an annual team board game tournament which generally has around 10 teams competing. Every year, the way the tables for the games are set up causes some grumbling, and I'm wondering if anyone could think of a perfect way to handle the seatings.

Here's the set up:

- The tournament consists of a minimum of four teams, of four players each
- Four rounds of 4-player games are played (different games, though I suppose that's irrelevant)

The seats are set up beforehand, so that each player knows which position he sits in each game:

- Player X has seat 1 in round A, seat 2 in round B, seat 3 in round C and seat 4 in round D
- Player Y has seat 2 in round A, seat 3 in round B, seat 4 in round C and seat 1 in round D
- Player Z has seat 3 in round A, seat 4 in round B, seat 1 in round C and seat 2 in round D
- Player W has seat 4 in round A, seat 1 in round B, seat 2 in round C and seat 3 in round D

---

In past tournaments, two separate algorithms have been used.

One algorithm has ensured that each team faces every other team an equal (or as close to equal as possible) amount of times. However, because of this some individual players had to face each other several times during the tournament (in the worst case, two players had to play each other in three rounds out of four).

Another algorithm ensured that each individual player never faced another individual player more than once. However, this made the different teams face each other an uneven amount of times: some teams faced each other 4 times and other teams 8 times, which is not good considering it's the team's combined results that count.

An optimal algorithm would do both:

- Individual players never face each other more than once
- All teams face every other team the same amount of times, or as close to the same amount as possible

Is this 'perfect algorithm' even possible? Obviously it's more difficult to achieve the less teams there are in the tournament - what would be the minimum amount of teams required to make this possible?

My immediate thought was to treat this is a graph search where nodes are a tuple of `(stone, previous leap size)` and neighbors of node `(x, y)` are `(x+y-1, y-1) (x+y, y) (x+y+1 , y+1)`, assuming of course that each node is in the list of stones.

I am not surprised by this at all, it seems that for large arrays, Radix Sort will always beat a comparison sort since it is O(32n) -&gt; O(n) on most systems.  Considering that this wasn't even an in-place radix sort, what advantages does QuickSort have that make it better than RadixSort, even on non-integer arrays?  I can maybe see strings giving it more trouble but for most other primitives (I know strings are not primitives in most languages) I can't see Radix Sort losing.

If this is the case, why is Quick Sort so much popular?  Is there some major flaw of in-place Radix Sort I have not seen yet?",,False,,t5_2qj1c,False,,,True,t3_1j2cam,http://www.reddit.com/r/algorithms/comments/1j2cam/radix_sort_inplace_vs_quick_sort/,

I have looked a lot online, but I have a few questions about graphs.  I will describe the problem that I want to solve, then people can tell me what the best way to proceed is.

I have a system where each node can be directional or bidirectional, and each of these length is a fractional, but non-negative number.  In the entire network, I have N nodes that I want to link in the least distance.  So I want to visit each node, but branching from the 'original' path is ok.  An additional bonus would be if I could not only return the optimal path(s), but also some number of slightly less than optimal paths (say, looking for +-leastdistance/sqrt(N nodes) or some other heuristic).

One other problem is that I would like to be able to add/remove/split/combine nodes at will.  I suspect that this will always completely destroy any previous information about the graph.  Another problem is that I would like to include unknown information nodes that can be used if a path between the two nodes cannot be found.

Looking through the tubes, I am looking for something with some (at least, somewhat) Markov properties, as well as graph theory.  I have looked at the different graph algorithms online, but I can't seem to find one that really suits my purpose.  I have a sneaking suspicion that this is an NP Hard problem, so I would just have to traverse every possible path in my graph.  I am on a mac (dur), and have boost installed and talking with Xcode, and was hoping to do this using the boost libraries and their graph/threading utilities.

It's hard to describe in text. It is about creating an algorithm to sort through a matrix of data and graph it.

I have to create a 3d graph that includes points(similar to a plot) and lines connecting the points. The catch is, the points are all placed in the graph *at positions in relation to where the other points are placed*.

For example, let's say I have a matrix of data. Each row/column is labeled by the point in the graph. Where Point A meets Point B, the data reads '3.' This '3' means that these two points' level of closeness should be '3.' Where Point A meets Point C, the data reads '5.' So Points A and C should be closer together than A and B, because 5 is more than 3.

So there's a number at every union in the matrix. The intersection with the largest number would mean that those two points should be the two closest points in the graph, and on the contrary the two points with the smallest number would be the farthest apart.

SO....I need to create an algorithm that would sort through the matrix and graph the points in respect to distance, based on the data in the matrix. Any ideas? Thank you for your time...

http://imgur.com/RPXb3 

So in that plot, the x value of a point is the color value of a pixel in the raw data, and the y value of every point is the color of the same pixel in the clean pic. i don't understand this. because this means that a color value of 0.5 in the raw data would sometimes be 0.05, sometimes 0.15, sometimes 0.25 in the clean pic, etc.

An obvious first step is to get an ARIMA(p,0,q) model working, which is an ARMA model.

So far the order I am going here is AR -&gt; ARMA -&gt; ARIMA in my development of this. My AR model uses gradient descent to determine the coefficients and works quite well. I have also made a separate MA model as well using gradient descent and it works, but the minute it doesn't work is when I apply gradient descent to the combined ARMA model.

I am sure I am doing something wrong here, but I have little exposure to statistics and its literature so I am trying to find some good resources I can review to catch my mistake or to find a better algorithm. My background is in mathematics so I understand the language, but its been awhile so I need to review.

So far I have code that iterates forward on a time series. At each iteration it updates the model coefficients based on gradient descent. It then stores the error in the current ""prediction"" and then uses it for the future calculation. The time series has data coming in piece by piece hence the reason I used gradient descent. From the start as the series feeds in, I want the model to ideally stabilize to some set of coefficients and then not change these when the learning rate become insignificant or 0. It seems to be working as expected with just an AR model currently using ""toy"" stationary series, getting pretty good predictions overall with stable coefficients.

For the ARMA model, it breaks down. It may be as simple as not determining my learning rate correctly or poor initialization, or some other stupid mistake. I am a little stumped at the moment and want to take a step back to review literature for a bit before chugging forward.

Does anyone know of any good pseudo-code or some text that actually outlines procedures for determining coefficients in an ARMA model? So far I can only find items on using R or pre-existing packages for constructing these models but I am trying to code the under-the-hood items myself in C#. I don't need model order selection or assumption validation algorithms yet, as I am just writing a tool where you specify an ARIMA(p,d,q) model, then it determines a ""best"" fit to some arbitrary time series.

1344348255.0,8,self.algorithms,xtn6h,Looking for an algorithm that can analyze overlaps and gaps in a set of N-dimensional intervals,TheShrimp,11,3,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/algorithms/comments/xtn6h/looking_for_an_algorithm_that_can_analyze/,"Let's say I have an N-dimensional Euclidean space and M N-dimensional intervals. I want to answer two questions:

1. Are there any overlaps?
2. Do the intervals fill the whole space? (= are there any gaps?)

Since these intervals can be multidimensional, I'm basically talking about N-arity tuples of standard mathematical intervals. For example:
    
    N = 1     x=[0, 100]
    N = 2     x=(0, 100), y=[0, ∞)
    ...

The whole thing easiest to explain with N = 1, M = 2. For example, let's say we have these intervals:

    x=(-∞, 0)
    x=[0, ∞)

In this case there are no gaps or overlap, because each possible x value exists in one, and only one interval.

This one has a gap at x=0:

    x=(-∞, 0)
    x=(0, ∞)

This one overlaps at x=0.

    x=(-∞, 0]
    x=[0, ∞)

My intuition tells me that the algorithm should somehow ""merge"" intervals and if there are no gaps, the end result should be one N-dimensional interval that equals to the complete N-dimensional space.

For example, these (N=1, M=3):

    x=(-∞, 0)
    x=[0, 100)
    x=[100, ∞)

could be merged in a pair-wise manner to x=(-∞, ∞) which has no gaps. The algorithm can fail immediately during a merge if an overlap is detected.

The curse of dimensionality will probably destroy me once N gets large, but I'm hoping that there's some kind of algorithm that would help me as long as N is small! Sorry about the terminology. I'm not really a compsci or a math guy, so I don't really know the correct words for these things.

**Edit**

I'd like to point out that the algorithm must support arbitrary N values, so building versions manually for different N values is not acceptable.

So, basically I'm looking for something like this (in Scala):

    // None denotes infinity
    case class IntervalPart(leftOpen: Boolean, left: Option[Double], right: Option[Double], rightOpen: Boolean)
    // N-dimensional interval

After a year or so from seeing it first time, I finally decided to go and implement Aho Corasick.

Its a multi pattern, single string matching algorithm: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aho%E2%80%93Corasick_string_matching_algorithm

I implemented it in C++, and I am pretty confident its correct, passed a sample UVA problem here: http://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&amp;Itemid=8&amp;category=24&amp;page=show_problem&amp;problem=1620

However, my implementation seems to be pretty slow, and memory consuming. When I tried another problem here: http://acm.timus.ru/problem.aspx?space=1&amp;num=1269

My solution memory limited at test 7.

Basically what I am doing is constructing a trie which will hold the automaton.

Each node has pointers to every possible alphabet can come out of it. First I did a pointer for each node (node * e[255+1]) then switched to map&lt;char,node*&gt; e but the performance almost did not differ at all (unordered_map [hash table in C++] even gave worse performance).

Nodes include also the failure links [f], character on that node, and the pattern number it represents (-1 if no pattern).

I build the trie normally by inserting each keyword, then calculate the failure links by BFSing, for each node, I check if its parent failure link has that character, keep going all the way until I reach the root.

Here is my full code (for the solution of the first problem): http://ideone.com/zkDol

Apologies for the coding style, however I think the general approach itself is what needs to be optimized.

The best I got so far, was a paper in some chinese university, recommending to use a structure called double array trie, which would not need 256 [alpha size] elements per node, here: http://security.riit.tsinghua.edu.cn/mediawiki/images/d/d7/Stringmatch.pdf

[pages 7 and 19]

However, I feel that I do not truly get the idea behind it, and how to use it to solve Aho-Corasick [if even that is the correct way to optimize Aho-Corasick].

I am feeling sort of miserable\bulldozered because of this algorithm and the time it took from me, yet still failed to implement it ""professionally"".

I am sure any helpful and simple replies would be really appreciated by me and by all people seeking better understanding for that sort of obsecure field of string algorithms.

I am not an expert in string\bioinformatics algorithms by any means.

I understood the basic notation used, and the algorithm which said that we shift the pattern by the length of the largest suffix which is also a prefix, the same one used in KMP, and the basic idea and concepts behind an automaton.

But for the rest of the ""strings magic"" I am still far from an expert in it, so the simpler the explanation, the way more helpful it would be :)

Each pair of points produces a right triangle like in [this figure](http://i.imgur.com/D8x5uVi.jpg) (here for illustration I only chose pairs with (a_i,b_i)).

The aim is to find the minimum (or better, sort) angles opposite the vertical side of the right triangles, i.e.

[; \underset{i,j}{\textrm{min}} ~ \tan(\phi_{ij}) = \underset{i,j}{\textrm{min}} ~ \frac{b_i - b_j}{a_i - a_j} . ;]

A naive approach is to compute all n^2 angles and return the smallest one.

An [; \mathcal{O}(n + n \log n) ;] approach is to

* sort the b-coordinates, thus inducing a ""b""-*order* on the points. This takes [; \mathcal{O}(n \log n) ;] time.

* for every point i in the b-*order* compute *only* the angles [; \phi _{i,i-1} ;] and [; \phi _{i,i+1} ;]. So in total there are n-1 angles to compute.

I claim that this simple sweep yields the minimum desired angle. This relies on the (maybe not so obvious) statement:

If [;b_i &lt; b_j &lt; b_k ~ ;]  then  [; ~ \textrm{min}(\phi _{ij}, \phi _{jk}) &lt; \phi _{ik} ~ ;] , where [; \phi \in \[0, \tfrac{\pi}{2}\] ;] .

**Proof:**

The possible arrangements of a triplet (i,j,k) such that [;~ b_i &lt; b_j &lt; b_k;], correspond to the three cases:

a) [;~ a_i &lt; a_k &lt; a_j ;]

b) [;~ a_i &lt; a_j &lt; a_k ;]

c) [;~ a_j &lt; a_i &lt; a_k ;] ,

also visualised [here](http://i.imgur.com/KJC0Fm3.jpg). It can be easily checked that each of these cases satisfies the above statement. The cases are exhaustive, up to reflection wrt to the a or b axis, in which case the order of the angles within the triplet is preserved . □

Google hasn't found me anything better than O(n^2 ) time. I can't find an answer key for this book anywhere either.

I'm a software developer and my current goal is to find a neat way to calculate the best price for a product among a list of different prices available for that specific product. I thought about how to do that and I **could** find a way to solve this with a lot of if's and else's and so on, but maybe there's a better solution by using some mathematics (I'm not good at that, unfortunately).

Scenario: Let's say I offer some kind of product for sale. I have competitors, who sell this product as well, but for different prices than I do. Every seller offers the same pre-defined sets of amounts for this product (100 packs, 500 packs, etc.).

I gathered all the data I need (all prices), now I want to find out what would be the best price for me to offer this product for.

There are several rules that apply for the calculation though: I do not necessarily want to be the cheapest seller everytime, I want to find the most profitable price for my product. In other words:

* if 1 or more of the competitors are **too** cheap, I don't want to go lower than them, but instead look for the next cheapest ones (this can be the 2nd or 3rd or even 4th cheapest of them).

* if I'm the cheapest among all of them, I want to increase my prices, but still stay cheapest (1 cent cheaper than 2nd cheapest).

* if there are 6 sellers for 1 product, and 1 is very cheap, while the 5 others (including me) offer for pretty similar prices, I only want to beat the other 4 so that I can become 2nd cheapest without going down with the price too much. It's like a ""how much positions can I go up and how much does that cost me?""-calculation. I need an algorithm that calculates the best position for the best price.

[Here's a table in Google docs with examples](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmYCWqNdQEBmdFJzVEhWdlNiWUlZa25odUEwbXlweGc#gid=0)

The ""best price"" column contains the price I want to sell this product for (calculated manually), so this is the value I want to get in the end.

All I'm actually asking for is if this can be done relatively easy with some math calculations, or if I have to stick with my ""by foot""-solution.",,False,,t5_2qj1c,False,,,True,t3_1eg6pk,http://www.reddit.com/r/algorithms/comments/1eg6pk/calculate_best_price_among_list_of_prices/,

For example the following code prints all combinations of an input string:

    void combination(String inputString, StringBuilder output, int index) {
        for(int i = index; i &lt; inputString.length(); i++) {
            output.append(inputString.charAt(i));

    combination(""abc"", new StringBuilder(), 0);

    a
    ab
    abc
    ac
    b
    bc
    c

I'm trying to write down the function call stack on paper to understand how this recursion works. But I always forget where the last recursive call was, what the values of the parameters were, and where the function goes back on the return statement.  

I need some way to run through recursive calls on paper that will help me keep track of the function calls, parameter values, and returns.  

For example, for the following function:

    int sumValues(int[] array) {
        int sum = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i &lt; array.length; i++) {
            sum += array[i];
        }
        return sum;
    }

To understand how it works, I would write it on paper like this:

    array = {1, 3, 5, 7}

|i       | array[i] | old sum     | new sum|
|:------:|:----------:|:---------------:|:------------:|
| 0     |          1|     0           |   1

| 3     | 7         |      9          | 16

The diameter of the graph is small, usually less than 10. I compute the shortest paths using BFS because the graphs I currently work on are non-weighted. Now here is my question:

Assume the source node is A and the target node is G and I computed the following shortest paths between A and G:

    A --&gt; B --&gt; D --&gt; F --&gt; G

    A --&gt; C --&gt; D --&gt; F --&gt; G

    A --&gt; C --&gt; D --&gt; E --&gt; G

    A --&gt; B --&gt; D --&gt; E --&gt; G


If we make a union of all these paths, here is how the induced sub-graph looks like:

            A
          /    \
        B       C
         \     /
            D
          /    \
        E       F
         \    /
           G

I would like to represent this graph using as small space as I could. Initially I thought about using the adjacency list representation and compressing the neighbors of a node using some known algorithms but then I came up with the idea of representing it using paths again. For example, the above sub-graph can be represented by only two of paths as:

    A --&gt; B --&gt; D --&gt; F --&gt; G    and
    A --&gt; C --&gt; D --&gt; E --&gt; G

which requires keeping only 10 vertices. On the contrary, without compressing the neighbors, the adjacency list representation would look like:

    A:    B,C
    B:    D
    C:    D
    .
    .
    etc

and would require 14 vertices. 


So without compression, representing the induced sub-graph using the paths themselves may require keeping less vertices (though I haven't done any analysis yet). 


I have been looking at algorithms books to see a similar problem and potential solutions but so far all I found is related to representing graphs in general. I have a feeling that this special type of induced sub-graph starting and ending with the same pair of vertices and having paths of the same length with intermediate vertices in common can be exploited in some way to reduce the space. My path union idea is just one and I am wondering if anyone has seen anything similar to this.

I have a set of things, size n. Each one has an associated weight, or probability of being picked. I have a fixed number of things I'm going to pull, m. m is typically a lot smaller than n [like, 1/10th]. FWIW, this is Java. [for interest, m is actually the sum of the weights]

*Solution 1:*
[This is the ""obvious, correct"" one]

Put everything into a list. I used an ArrayList. Run across the list and sum the weights into a ""totalVal"". Roll the dice to pick a number in the range 0..totalVal. Run across the set with an accumulator [O(n)] and remove the one that falls on the number [O(n)]. Total time, O(m*(n^2)).

*Solution 2:*
[This is a performance improvement, but I'm unsure the clarity of code was worth the gain]

Do the same thing as before, but modify ""remove"" to be ""swap with the one at the end of the list"". Time O(m*n), since ""removal"" just became O(1).

*Solution 3:*

This one is probabilistic in performance, so I don't know how to analyze if it's actually better. First, in the same pass as I previously calculated totalVal, I store an accumulator on the set items themselves. Now it's easy to do a O(log(n)) algorithm to find the thing I'm looking for each time I roll a dice. Obviously naive removal is going to be O(n) as I have to iterate across the entire list to fix the iterator. O(m*n*log(n)), not as good as the one before.

So, the real difference is that I now do accept/reject. Rather than actually remove an item from the list, I just tag it as having previously been selected. The performance of this is O(m * log(n)) assuming I get no rejections. If I have selected an item that has previously been drawn, then I reject the roll and try again.

Solution 3 is faster in practice by wallclock, when I try it. But I don't know how to analyze this to figure out what point it's better or worse. For example, if n==m, that's gonna be obviously some awful performance. If m is 1, it'll be zippyfast.

Firstly, please forgive my improper use of mathematical terms - my grey matter is way too rusty!

I'm trying to come up with an algorithm that converts input X (between 1 and 1000 (inclusive)) to output Y (same range). 

X inputs have an even distribution between 1-1000, but the Y outputs  are ""pulled"" towards 500. The further X is from 500, the bigger/smaller Y is.

For example;
X = 1 then Y = 1,
X = 100 then Y = 110,
X = 200 then Y = 230,
X = 500 then Y = 500,
X = 800 then Y = 770,
X = 900 then Y = 890,
X = 1000 then Y = 1000

For the inputs 1, 500, and 1000 above, these are the outputs I want.
For 100, 200, 800, and 900 I've just made a guess - I'm simply trying to show the ""pull"" towards 500.

Can anyone please help me with the algorithm? Ideally in a form where I can tinker with the terms to get different output results, so that I can plot it and get the result that ""looks best""?

Recall: for a polynomial-time reduction ≤p, L ≤p M means that there is a computable
function f: alphabet of L→alphabet of M such that x∈L iff f(x)∈M.
Since L1≤p L2 and L2≤p L3, let g, h be functions such that a∈ L1 iff g(a) ∈ L2, and b∈
L2 iff h(b) ∈ L3, respectly. The composition of g and h, h⋅g is function such that for x∈

I have to design an algorithm for a college class that gives a model for a 3-SAT (if it exists).

So far I have designed a strategy of backtracking recursion. A variable is chosen, and then it's assigned to true or false and the recursion goes on to choose the next one. If a contradiction is found, the algorithm goes back to the last known possible point and tries with another value. 

The key here is how to choose the next variable everytime the recursive function is called. I have designed an heuristic that gives full probability to those variables which are alone in a clause (that is, the other two variables are 0). When only two variables are left to decide they get some ""points"" (in this case 5) and when all of the 3 variables are yet to be assigned, all variables get one point. After adding up all these ""points"" I choose the variable with the highest value and continue with the recursive strategy.

When the size of the problem is small (&lt;100 variables) my algorithm solves it in less than a second. But as things get bigger (&gt;250 variables) it takes up to 1 minute or more.

I found a recurrance but I would like to chat/talk it out to see if it holds. I will be doing bottom up approach.
Runtime I have is O(n^2) and space is also O(n^2)

Given S='Analysis' and T='Algorithms' let L[i,j] be the length of our longest substring where i and j are pointers to the ends of S,T. 

Let i and j be pointers to the end of each string, we decrement along to move them. 

Base Case : 
We reach the end of our string; s[0] and t[0] where i and j are both 0. Return length[i,j]


    L[i,j] = L(i-1,j-1) + 1   //we have un-common values so increment our length and move our pointers along


Here's where I'm stuck. I'm not sure how to express the recurrance for when i and j have found equal characters. I believe they should just move along and not increment our length. If that's it then im good. 

Skeleton Code
    len[0,0] = 0;
    max = 0;

    if(i==0 || j==0) return len[i,j]; //base case
   
    if(s[i] == t[j]) // equal characters, save length and reset length to 0
        max = l[i,j]
        len = 0;

* (gamma) The summing junction of my parts, where you have two inputs and one output.

The idea is that for each assembly I build I have one alpha-&gt; two taus -&gt; a gamma (although the order probably isn't important for the overall math); and I want to have it so all their ""imperfections"" balance each other out to zero, or as close as possible.

express N -1 as u*2^t where u is odd.  For each randomly chosen a, compute a^u, a^2u, a^4u, ... , a^N-1 .  The normal fermat test just checks whether a^N-1 is equal to 1, but this modified test also looks for the smallest a^k that equals 1, and checks if a^k/2 equals -1.

I am new to R but I used it to run one-way ANOVA and rejected the null hypothesis and concluded that the three algorithms are not all equally effective. Good, but I still need to rank them (ie Are algorithm A and B not statistically different from eachother, but different from C?)

After reviewing the literature I found a [paper](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.140.7839&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf) that claims to be able to check n integers in O(n) time.

I would also appreciate any comments on code style, documentation or any other ideas related to public code since my eventual goal is to use this project and others as sample code to make a career change to software engineering.

and index j where i &lt; j &lt;=n-1, we need to see if the subset of A[i … j] holds no duplicate values.
We call this out ""range uniqueness query.""  It returns a boolean whether or not the set holds unique values.

Beginner’s approach: we can see a very easy to implement algorithm that requires no preprocessing simply checks each element in A[i … j].  This requires |A[i … j]|2 comparisons.  This is also very bad.   Conclusion: Θ(n) space, Θ(k pow2) RUQ run-time (given k = |A[i … j]|). 

Beginner’s approach 2: we can see multiple redundant comparisons are made when checling the array A[i … j].  First off, we needn’t compare it to itself.  Also, one we check a pair of elements that pair is done.  This requires ceiling((|A[i … j]| -1)2/2) comparisons.  This is still very bad.
Θ(n) space, O(k pow2) RUQ run-time (given k = |A[i … j]|).

We want to reduce the number of comparisons by constructing a datastructure to compute some of it beforehand.  Then, the algorithm run on it takes care of the rest.  Note that we only care about… 
A)	The space of the resultant data structure
B)	The run-time of the RUQ

We can take as long as we want to construct the data structure, as long as it doesn’t take up too much space.

We could compute all values of all ranges before hand in a lookup table, but that would take Θ(n pow2) space, even though we get O(1) runtime.

Our prof gave us a hint saying it could be done looking at range minimum queries.

I was thinking, we could compute the uniqueness of subsets in the form of a segment tree, but if the elements of the subset do not form a whole branch of the tree, computations can get a bit out of hand.

Today I came across this [Programming Puzzle](http://www.spotify.com/se/jobs/tech/bilateral-projects/) on Spotify and thought I'd take a shot at identifying the algorithm that could be used to solve this problem. So I dug into the Catalog which is the second part of the book and felt like I narrowed it down to Set cover/Set packing problem. But after an hour of digging into them, I realized that neither of the algorithms fit the problem.

So I have 2 questions:
1) Am I doing it right? Is this the correct way to solve problems like these? i.e., Try and identify the underlying algorithm that would solve the problem and then use that as the starting point. Or should I just try and solve the puzzle using my logical abilities and forget about trying to apply algorithms altogether.

2) I feel like I've abstracted the problem to something that would already have a standard algorithm for:

The total amount to be distributed to the staff is R.

Each employee is supposed to get a productivity bonus calculated as:  

* bonus = R * P / (sum of P for the staff)

That is, each employee gets a share of R according to his percentage of the overall productivity (sum of P for the staff).

But for an employee to get the productivity bonus, this bonus has to be above what he would normally be paid (salary S).
Let's call an employee E1 and his salary S1 and his productivity measure P1.

That is, E1 receives the bonus only if:

* S1 &lt; R * P1 / (sum of P for the staff)

When an employee's productivity bonus is below his salary S, his P is taken from the overall productivity and his salary is taken from R.
So after E1 is removed, the bonus is recalculated for the remaining employees as:

* bonus after E1 is removed = (R - S1) * P / (sum of P for the staff - P1)

This process repeats until no employee is removed or until all of them are removed.

When someone's salary is too high with low productivity, the bonus for the remaining employees will be reduced and different people will be removed from the calculation in the next iteration.

Description:  Suppose that a directed graph is given, in which each edge is weighted by a (strictly positive) number, and each vertex has been assigned a color from the set {C1,..,CN}.

A finite sequence of colors is given, X1,X2,...,XM.  The problem is to find a sequence of vertices x1,...,xM such that:

* each vertex in the sequence is adjacent to the previous vertex in the sequence (except the first vertex, of course)

* vertex xk must have color Xk (so the kth vertex must have the kth given color)

* the weight of the resulting path is minimal.  (Weight is computed in the usual way, summing the weights of the edges traversed.)

Two important notes.  First, vertex x1 may be any vertex with appropriate color X1 (i.e. there is no particular starting location given, only a required starting color).  Second, a vertex may be repeated in the chosen sequence.  (In the application I have in mind, not only are vertices repeated, they are often repeated.)

It is straightforward to code up a brute-force attack (tree out all of the vertex sequences satisfying the given sequence of colors, choose the one of minimal weight).  I am wondering if this is a problem that has been studied before, and if there is a more elegant approach to solving the problem.  (A modification to Dijkstra's algorithm came to mind first.)

I am researching clustering algorithms for data that is not numeric. I am not at liberty to discuss exactly on what data I'm clustering (it's proprietary information), but I can give you an idea of the kind of data I have. Also, I am somewhat new to this area of study. Please let me know if my understanding is off and I should be trying different things.

So, pretty much all of the clustering algorithms I've come across so far use some notion of distance to find clusters. This is fine if your data is numeric and it has some intrinsic *value* that we find meaningful. For example, we would consider the value of a housing price meaningful because we could compare two instances of it in a helpful way: $200k - $150k = $50k lets us know that the value of the first price is more than the second. A distance measure would thus be helpful in this case. This is not so for categorical data. Categorical data is where the instances of the feature all fall into a set with no natural ordering. Car makes, for example, would be considered categorical data. We would find no meaning in comparing the names of two manufacturers in the same way we did the housing prices: Ford - Toyota = ??? is not very helpful. Even if we assigned numbers to the categories, the distances we would find would be arbitrary and hence meaningless.

My data is a mix of these two things. I have numeric, categorical, and boolean features in my data sets (I consider boolean data a subset of categorical data, although we *might* find boolean distances meaningful with proper scaling). My research so far has turned up these two promising-ish papers:

* [Clustering Mixed Numeric and Categorical Data: A Cluster Ensemble Approach](http://arxiv.org/ftp/cs/papers/0509/0509011.pdf)

* [Rock: A Robust Categorical Algorithm for Clustering Attributes](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~sudipto/mypapers/categorical.pdf)

I don't know if these are quite what I'm looking for. They seem a bit hand-wavey about certain things (especially the first), but the other papers I found were much worse. Is there anyone on here who has experience with trying to cluster this type of data? If so, could you point me in the direction of some decent papers to read up on?

Thanks in advance!

I've been programming for about 6 years now. I started in college (majoring in CSE) and immediately after that, I decided to join graduate school. I have absolutely no industry experience (I don't know if that matters or not), but I will be starting my first full time job (SDE) in a big company this fall.  

So here's my problem: When I'm trying to come up with an algorithm for something, I always try to optimize my algorithm as much as possible in my first attempt. I always aim for perfection in my first attempt. What that does is that it distracts me from the actual problem at hand to the point where I'm not thinking about the actual problem, rather trying to come up with the optimal way to solve the incomplete problem.  

I noticed this during my interviews too. Whenever I was asked a coding question, I'd try to come up with the best solution in the first attempt. Effectively, not thinking about the actual problem at all.  

I have the same problem in practice (while I'm actually coding). For example, in Java, I try to avoid using Lists and always see if there's a way to work around them and use arrays instead. In my brain, I'm thinking, ""Arrays are more *native*. Lists have overhead. The array solution will be more efficient."" And it doesn't stop there. If I come to the conclusion that I cannot do without Lists, then after I've got the List and have to return it, I'll convert the list to an array and return an array instead because, ""It will be more efficient.""  

Sometimes, I even try to reuse variables/objects.

/rant

So here's what I wanted to ask:

1. Does anyone else do this? How do I get out of this mindset of always aiming for the best solution?
2. In practice, how much more efficient is it really, if I use an array instead of a list? Are there any numbers?

You are given N, as well as a subset of combinations for the dials that are not valid.

Of course, this is just an example, but the idea is that each combination of dials would represent a vertex in a graph, and each edge would be a valid way of getting from one combination to the next.

A similar example would be generating valid moves for a game board.

In either case, you could use the graph to find the shortest path from an initial state, to a target state.

My question is, what is the fastest way to generate the adjacency list? The naive solution, I would think, would be to generate each combination, and check to see if it were valid. And then, for each solution, create all possible neighbors, and check to see if those are in the valid combination list.

I am developing a search engine for an upcoming web venture, and desperately need some help.

This search engine will return a list of user profiles. Each profile is assigned a score based off how much content they have added - 50 points for profile pictures, 10 pts for high priority content, 5 pts for medium, and 2 pts for low. Each profile also has a 0-5 star rating, and an integer value which represents the amount of times that the profile's owner has made a sprocket.
The problem is that I need an algorithm which orders by profiles with high ratings and content scores but low sprocket counts.
From my limited mathematical knowledge, I think that the ""baseline"" would be 3 sub-scores:

    priority = (sprockets / total sprockets) + (rating / 5) + (score / max score)

I have the feeling like it shouldn't be so simple, though. Are there any obvious consequences of this lay formula? Is there a better way to do this? What about curving each sub-score, perhaps with an adjustable constant (don't kill me) to change each sub-score's importance?
Any help would be much appreciated. I'm also not just looking for an answer, but also a learning opportunity.

**edit**: I am aware that in my equation the number of sprockets a profile has increases priority, which is not what I want. This is an obvious example of why I need help.

**edit 2**: Here's the one response I got on r/math from **jeffrey_negrea**, and it looks good (at least from the perspective of a person who is mathematically blind; moi). Any thoughts?

    base = (rating / 5) + (score / max score)  
    spro = (sprockets / total sprockets)
  
&gt; If you want priority to decrease when sprockets increase, one option is to ""discount"" base at a rate proportional to the number of sprockets. Let e be your favourite positive real value. Let our ""nominal interest rate convertible k times per year"" be i = (e)(spro). Define priority to be the present value of $base received in 1 year.

    priority = base / [1 + i/k]k = [(rating / 5) + (score / max score)] / [1 + (sprockets / total sprockets)(e/k)]k

&gt; The highest score possible is 2 occurring iff rating=5, score = max score and sprockets = 0  
The lowest score possible is 0 occurring iff rating = score = 0.  As the number of compounding intervals per unit time goes to infinity, we get the limiting priority function

    priority = (base)exp{-i} = base / [1 + i / k] k = [(rating / 5) + (score / max score)] exp{-(sprockets / total sprockets) e}

Definition (for this discussion): 
Lower Bound : Minimum number of steps a algorithm needs to perform a task T to achieve a desired result Z.

Conversation between two machines A and B to perform task T (and produce
a desired result):

A: I need atleast X steps to peform this task. Mind you, that is atleast X,
meaning I may need lot more than X steps, but alteast X.

B : Ok, so X is your lower bound. I have an algorithm, but my algorithm needs
at least Y steps. and Y &gt; X. So, looks like your algorithm may be better for some
instances of the problem, where you may just need X or a little over X steps.

A: Y is your lower bound and my lower bound is better than yours. Also, I
believe any machine in the world will need at least X steps to perform task T.

Case 1:

Machine C walks in

C: Hold it A. I have an instance of the problem and an algorithm which will need
only Z steps for that instance and more than Z steps for all other instances.
Also, Z &lt; X. So, I have the best lower bound.

(Here C, just disproved A's claim about A's lower bound being best among ALL algorithms for task T).

Case 2:

Machine C walks in

C: Hold it A. Let me say something. You claim you need atleast X
steps to perform task T. But, I have a proof that any algorithm always needs W ( where W &gt; X ) steps to perform task T ( for all different instances of task T). So, I am tightening your lower bound. Needing atleast X steps is a valid statement since W&gt;X, but still was not tight.

I'm actually studying computer science, but am just getting into it, and therefore don't quite have the knowledge or experience be able to come up with a solution to this (though I'm looking forward to learning something during this process, hopefully).

So here's the problem.

I'm not sure how familiar many of you are with fantasy football, (or any fantasy sport really, it doesn't matter which) but the beginning of each season starts with a draft. You and your friends (usually 10, 12, or 14 people total) take turns choosing real-life players to be on your imaginary team, filling spots on your roster based on football position. Once a player is chosen, he's taken, and can't be selected by anyone else.

What I'm looking to do is to create a program or algorithm that will select the best team possible given the number of players that should be selected at each position. I've already broken the players into rounds, and have assigned values to each of them. A brief, simplified example:

Say my draft is much smaller. There are only 4 people playing in the league, drafting 5 total rounds, and I want 2 running backs (RB), one quarterback (QB), and two wide receivers (WR). The rounds look as follows.

**Round 1**

QB A (87 points)
QB B (80 points)
RB A (79 points)
WR A (75 points)

**Round 2**

RB B (70 points)
WR B (68 points)
WR C (67 points)
RB C (65 points)

**Round 3**

QB C (62 points)
RB D (60 points)
WR D (58 points)
QB D (56 points)

**Round 4**

QB E (55 points)
WR E (53 points)
WR F (52 points)
QB F (51 points)

**Round 5**

RB E (49 points)
WR G (46 points)
WR H (45 points)
QB G (42 points)

Being able to pick one player from each round, I want to garner the highest point total possible ending with a roster of 1 QB, 2 RB's, and 2 WR's. While this is fairly simple reduced down to this size, it's much more complicated (with there being literally millions of possible paths) when you have a group of 14 people selecting for 15 rounds.

Can anyone suggest how to go about doing this, or is anyone able to think of a set of steps to accomplish this? I haven't the faintest idea where to start, so I'd really appreciate any help anyone might be able to give.

I am wanting to create a different probability matrix for each combination of X, Y and Z. This matrix will have values 0 through Z on both axes, with one axis indication the number of successes on the black dice rolled and one axis indicating the number of successes on the white dice rolled. The end result is a chart that allows me to reference corresponding cells to determine my chances of rolling exactly A black-dice successes and exactly B white-dice successes when drawing Z dice from a bag containing X black dice and Y white dice.

The method I am using to model these probabilities is as follows: For each possible combination of A black-dice successes and B white-dice successes (with proposed values A and B ranging from 0 to the sample size Z), I go through each set of possible values for the number of black dice (P) and the number of white dice (Q) drawn Z at a time and calculate the probabilities that each particular combination would produce exactly A black-dice successes and B white-dice success. I do this by finding the product of:

* the probability of rolling A black-dice successes (0.5 ^ A)

* the probability of rolling black-dice failures on the remaining black dice (0.5 ^ (Z - (A+Q)))

* the probability of rolling B white-dice successes (0.333 ^ B)

* the probability of rolling white-dice failures on the remaining white dice (0.667 ^ (Z - (B+P)))

I then use the hypergeometric distribution for a population size X+Y with X possible successes and a sample size of Z to determine the probability that exactly P black dice would be drawn in the first place and multiply the above product by that number. This gives me the probability that I will draw exactly P black dice and Q white dice when drawing Z dice from a bag of X black dice and Y white dice, and then subsequently roll A black-dice successes and B white-dice successes. The summation of all values of P+Q=Z gives me a single cell in my matrix offering the probability of rolling exactly A black-dice successes and exactly B white-dice successes when drawing Z dice from a bag containing X black dice and Y white dice.

I have written a Java program to run these numbers for me because ain't nobody trying to do all that on paper, amirite? (Also, I recognize that there are values of A and B that are not possible for some combinations of XYZ. The program detects these and sets those probabilities to zero before the point of summation.)

My problem: my algorithm should produce values for all possible combinations but when I run the program and add up all of the values in the completed matrix, I come up with a value that is less than zero. Now, computer programs are complex and finicky things. . .I know this. It is entirely possible that I bullocks up the code somewhere and that is the issue. However, what I am trying to determine is this: **is the method described above correct or have I messed up my algorithm?**

The age of the universe in Planck time (sometimes considered the smallest unit of time)

Therefore, the 

- max number of cpu cores × max clock ticks ≈ 10^141 steps

In the last five years, this becomes

Reasonably, the most steps a person could run a program for is 

- 500 cores × 4 GHz × 5 years ≈ 10^20 steps.

Say you wanted to sort 100 items. If we try to do this by brute force, i.e. by putting them in random order until we get the right one, we get

- number of permutations = 100! ≈ 10^158.

&gt;  MoveTower(disk - 1, spare, dest, source)  


&gt;END IF

I want to impose a restriction on this though. You cannot go from source right to dest, or from A to C (if you label each tower A,B,C from left to right). So for one disk, you'd move A-&gt;B-&gt;C rather than just A-&gt;B. (Same to move back: C-&gt;B-&gt;A)

I know that the complexity moves from 2^n to 3^n, but I'm having trouble with the actual pseudocode.
