You have two ropes. Each rope takes one hour to burn. These ropes are not identical, nor are they uniform; i.e. it does not necessarily take half an hour for half the rope to burn (if you have trouble visualizing this, imagine a rope of varying thickness across its length).

""Hello Reddit.
I wish that our encounters could be more cordial, but I fear that they will not be. This is the first time you've seen me, but I assure you, it won't be the last. I have, hidden away, a 27 year old male. He has 48 hours to live. He is my first victim, but he won't be the last. Reddit, I'd like to give you a chance to save him. Within my text, there is a code. It is not hard to crack, nor is it hidden very hard. Crack my code, I will release him. Fail, and he will die on 06-10-13 at 23:59 hours.
Good bye, Reddit. Good luck. I'll be back two days from now.


Edit: Perhaps the edit will help some of you. My apologies for the midnight confusion, but congratulations on cutting a minute off his life. Goodbye.""

Secret Life of Sherlock Holmes” were casting 
for the part of the protagonist, three young 
actors applied for the job. They all gave 
exemplary readings and the producers were 
hard pressed to chose between them. The 
director did have a slight preference for Byron 
Bentley, who came closest to fitting the 
director’s image of what the great Holmes 
should look like, so it was decided to determine 
how Bentley compared to Holmes in the 
reasoning department. 
The director obtained five identical 
handkerchiefs and, in front of the three 
applicants, wrote “Sherlock Holmes” on three 
of the handkerchiefs and “Professor Moriarty”
on the other two. He then stood Bentley center 
stage and pinned one of the handkerchiefs on 
Bentley’s back. Next, one of the other 
applicants was told to stand behind Bentley 
and a handkerchief was pinned on his back. 
The second applicant could see the name on 
Bentley’s handkerchief but could not see the 
name on his own.
The third applicant was placed behind the other 
two, so that he could see the names on their 
handkerchiefs but neither they nor he could see 
the name on the handkerchief that was placed 
on his back. Bentley, of course, could not see 
any handkerchief. “The first one of you who 
can deductively determine the name on his 
own back will get the part,” the director 
announced. After a few minutes of silence, 
Bentley correctly asserted that he was Sherlock 
Holmes. How did he know? “Elementary, my 
dear student.”",,False,,t5_2qiux,False,,,True,t3_1bfa9x,http://www.reddit.com/r/riddles/comments/1bfa9x/napkin_riddle/,

Little Johnny was overwhelmed, he loved writting puns, so he went home that night and came up with 10 puns to submit. Johnny waited all week to see the results for his class, and to see which puns would go on to the competition. On Friday, the teacher announced to the class which puns she picked... How many puns of Johnnies got picked?

100 people find themselves at the gates of hell. The devil tells them that they'll have a chance to go to heaven instead, but first they'll have to play a game.
The devil is going to line them all up in a straight queue, each person facing the back of the next person in line. The order of people in this line will be randomly chosen when the game starts.
He is then going to put a red or blue hat on each person. Each hat can be red or blue at random. Nobody knows the color their hat will be before the game starts.
Each person will be able to see the hat of everyone in front of them, but won't be able to see the hats of anyone behind them. Everyone can hear everyone else.
The devil will then then ask each person the color of their hat, starting at the back of the line and moving forward. Each person must just say ""red"" or ""blue"", without any extra intonation. People cannot communicate at all beyond merely saying the word ""red"" or ""blue"". If a person correctly says the color of their own hat, then they will be sent to heaven;; if they get the color wrong they stay in hell.
Before the game starts, the people are allowed to come up with a strategy to save as many people as possible. One man proposes that every other person says the color of the hat of the person in front of them, and then the people in between repeat that color to save themselves. ""That will save a guaranteed 50 people, and will probably save around 75,"" he says.
""No,"" a woman says. ""I've got a plan that is guaranteed to save 99 of us, maybe all of us.""

A prince has been promised in marriage to one of four daughters of a neighboring king. Unfortunately, three of the princesses were enchanted at birth by an evil witch. One is honest, but insane -- she always believes the opposite of the truth; one is sane, but magically compelled to lie at all times; and one is both insane *and* compelled to lie. The fourth, unenchanted, princess is honest and sane. To complicate matters, they are physically identical. They can tell each other apart, but no one else can.

The prince is introduced to all four princesses at once. Of course, he'd like to marry the non-enchanted princess, but since their father would prefer to get rid of one of the enchanted ones, who are always causing trouble, he refuses to let the young man get to know them or even ask any questions. Luckily, the non-enchanted princess, being clever and having taken a liking to the prince (as well as wanting to get away from her crazy sisters), speaks a single sentence that proves beyond any doubt that she is not enchanted.

What does she say?

Edit: For further clarification, ""insanity"" in this problem is defined as necessarily believing all false statements and disbelieving all true ones. Liars are compelled to profess the opposite of what they believe, so an insane liar would be unable to affirm, for example, ""2+2 does not equal four"" or ""the sky is not blue"", because they believe those statements to be true and therefore must deny them.

Edit 2: Here is a hint, which I'll spoiler tag for those who don't want one! [The sane, honest princess must differentiate herself along two dimensions from her sisters. Therefore her sentence must have at least two elements. However, there are other ways to combine logical statements than just ""and"".](/sp)

Edit 3: Answer time! [The sentence is ""Either I am enchanted or I have two dishonest sisters."" In order to affirm it the speaker must believe *exactly one* of its components is true (if she is honest) or believe neither or both of them are true (if she is a liar). The sane liar believes the first part is true and the second false, so the sentence is true, which means she must deny it. The insane liar believes the first part is false and the second part is true, meaning she believes the sentence as a whole is true, so she must deny it. The insane truth-teller believes neither are true (since both are actually true from her POV) and denies it. Only the sane truth-teller can possibly say it, because she believes one element is true and can be honest.](/sp)",,False,,t5_2qiux,1367354827.0,,,True,t3_1dfdwa,http://www.reddit.com/r/riddles/comments/1dfdwa/insanity_and_lies/,

The landlord , who is old, selfish and ugly, wants to marry the labourer's beautiful daughter. So he suggests a deal.

He says that he will cancel the debt if he can marry the daughter. Both labourer and daughter are horrified by the 'proposal'. 

So the landlord suggest that they let chance decide the outcome. 

He tells them that he will put a black pebble and a white pebble into an empty, opaque bag. Then daughter is to pick one pebble from the bag. 

1) If she chooses the black pebble, she is to become the landlord's wife and the debt will be forgiven.

2) If she chooses the white pebble does not need to marry him and the debt will still be forgiven. 

3) But if she refuses to pick a pebble at all, her father will be thrown in prison.

The path on which the three stand is covered in both black and white pebbles. But the keen-eyed daughter notices that as the landlord picks up the stones to put in the bag, he chooses two black pebbles, and no white. This means that if she picks, she will inevitably pick a black stone. If she cries foul, the landlord will have her father arrested.

How does the daughter avoid the proposal (assuming she cannot slip another stone into the bag without being spotted)?

One leads to freedom, the other leads to certain death.

There are three guards stationed by the doors. One of them always tells the truth, one always lies, and one answers randomly. The prisoner knows this, but he doesn't know which guard is which. The prisoner is allowed *two* questions (he can ask both to one guard or one each to two separate guards). How does he get out?

edit: They have to be yes-or-no questions. Random answers randomly between ""yes"" and ""no""; he won't just say ""purple"" or anything like that. I don't think you could even solve the riddle with non-yes-or-no questions, because of Liar and Random (think about their responses to questions that aren't yes-or-no), but if you manage it I will hear that answer.

edit2: The guards know which door is which, only you don't.

edit3: The guards know which guard is which, only you don't.

edit4: If a guard can't answer a question properly (according to their rules) with ""yes"" or ""no"", they answer randomly. (added 2/18/13 @ 5:02 PM EST)

edit5: This is all in binary. The available answers are ""yes"" and ""no"". The liar can't just say ""purple"" because it's not the correct answer, and random can't just say ""purple"" because it's a random word.

Firstly, if you're making a post, it's very nice if you *respond to the people who guess*. It's not a huge subreddit, and most riddles will have only a few guesses. It's appreciated if you respond to each, with things like ""nope, keep trying!"", ""you're on the right track"", or ""yeah, you got it!"". This encourages users to keep trying, and tells them if/when they get it right.

Also, spoiler tags, spoiler tags, spoiler tags. If you don't spoiler tag your guesses, it ruins it for anyone else trying to solve the riddle. I've added a reminder which you'll see when submitting a comment. If you're not sure how to use spoiler tags, it's in the sidebar, to the right.

A couple of months ago, I asked for help creating a riddle for my D&amp;D campaign. I received several comments and put the best parts of each together to make a whole. A couple of people said it might be too easy, but that wasn't the case. In fact, nobody in the group was able to solve even the first part of it. I was hoping [1] /r/riddles would give it a shot (well, another shot) and solve it. The background of the riddle is that a man killed your parents and he left you with nothing but a riddle to find him with:

There will come a day to choose a side
and grasp the hand wrought with pride.
With clenched teeth, I'll hold my place,
and silently greet you face to face.

Turn around and say my name.

Edit: Perhaps this riddle really was made too difficult. I gave some hints to them, though, such as guessing an object would be closer than guessing a concept. Also, I told them that the ""clenched teeth"" and the ""hand"" were both made of metal. 

Edit #2:  Congratulations for all who guessed [A door](/sp)  I'll give the full story about the riddle and the second part of it below.

[The player who was given this riddle controls the most intelligent character of the group - INT 22 - and it has been a running joke to say ""It's a door"" when he rolls low for a knowledge check. It happened the first time in a dungeon when he rolled for knowledge about a particular type of door and door trap. He rolled a 1, which gave him a 6 total at the time. My response? ""It's a door."" We joke about it pretty much every session, so this is why I chose ""It's a door"" as the answer to the riddle. Right in front of everyone's faces, yet was never realized. Anyway, the second part of the riddle was ""Turn around and say my name,"" which, if you turn ""It's a door"" around, you get ""Rood a sti"" - Ruudasti - the murderer's name. Saying the name conjures a wrought iron door which opens to residence of the murderer.](/sp)

They're cold, they're hungry, but worst of all... there is a serial killer on the loose! One of the 10 people is a psychotic serial killer who kills based off of a sick pattern he has invented (NOTE: I say ""he"" out of convenience; keep in mind the killer could be a woman). 

Here are the 10 people:

-Danny, an excitable young college student

-Clementine, Danny's ditsy, absentminded girlfriend

-William, a rich and stuck-up business tycoon

-Josephine, a MILF and housewife

-Harrison, Josephine's bratty 10-year-old son

-Carl, a socially-awkward, nerdy teenager

-Hilary, an investigative reporter

-AJ, a rich orthodontist

-Curtis, a surly, grouchy construction worker

-Amy, a budding actress

One of these is a serial killer following a simple pattern--a pattern that, if discovered, will reveal who the killer is. 

The lights went out, there was screaming and gasping, and when they're turned back on, AJ is laying in a pool of blood, bludgeoned to death. 

After a while, the lights go out again. When they're turned on, the group is met with a grisly sight: Amy has been killed the same way.

The lights are turned off once more; once they flick back on, everyone sees Carl dead on the floor, beaten to death.

The lights turn off again; when they come back on, everyone sees that this time, the victim was Danny. 

The lights turn off again and another murder is committed. When the lights come back, everyone is shocked to see Hilary dead on the floor.

Who is the killer's next target? Can you find out who the killer is? (if you figure out the pattern you'll notice the odd man/woman out).

try to guess what we are, go ahead, it's fine,

but don't say I didn't warn you when your brain turns to mush.

if you don't care, then prepare for the rush!

[](/sp)

I am so large that I have 4 parts,

one's laid in sidewalks, another is art,

a third is quite general, the last is specific,

everyone thinks that I am terrific!

[](/sp)

My first sister's hobby is describing the world,

in fact, she described me, and my meaning unfurled,

she likes me and our third brother, and just for fun,

we follow her around, through the moonlight and sun.

[](/sp)

Our second brother's moving, present and past,

he commands us as if we're just as fast,

also, he's fickle, and it drives us all nuts,

all that undoing redoing has got to take guts!

[](/sp)

Our second sister likes things that connect,

but for reasons unknown, she gets little respect,

perhaps it's because she's always been small,

when really she leads us at times, proud and tall.

[](/sp)

Our third brother seems to have taken my path,

but he's ever so lazy and, well, you do the math:

He sums up so much 'cause he hates wasting breath,

he's done it since birth, and he'll do it 'till death.

[](/sp)

Our third sister improves what was done by our first,

as well as brother #2 (it's the worst!),

she'll even improve herself, yeah, that's right,

she brags about how many things rewrites!

[](/sp)

Our fourth brother moves in so many ways,

in, out, through, over, under, just like in a maze,

he assists brother 2 and connects him to me,

he does it with joy, and he does it with glee.

[](/sp)

Sister 4 is quite loud, and goes solo a lot,

she leads our big group in the front, if not,

she's quite a loose cannon and curses a ton,

she interrupts others and won't stop til she's done.

[](/sp)

Brother 5 is little known and doesn't own a lot,

in fact, 3 possessions is all he's got,

but he's quite persistent and contributes the most,

and he doesn't care that he's treated like a ghost.

[](/sp)

So that is our tale, I hope you enjoyed,

if you can't identify us, don't get annoyed,

don't worry, you'll figure it out in time,

but for now, this is my final rhyme.

The order that the prisoners are sent to the room is fairly random. More accurately, there is no fixed pattern to the order or frequency with which prisoners visit the special room, but at any given time, every prisoner is guaranteed to visit the it again.

At any time, any prisoner may declare that all 25 of them have been inside the special room. If he/she is right, all of the prisoners go free. If wrong, they are all executed.

They will be allowed a planning session together before they are taken to their rooms. What strategy can they use to guarantee that they will make it out alive?

Of course, over the years, most of these nights tend to run together – every Saturday was the same. Except for one particular night, that is – a night that stands all alone in my memory. After all, it was the night that Mom was shot. She certainly was not hurt, but if she reads this story and figures out which of her son’s shot her, that son might not be getting much in the way of Christmas presents this year. Confused? You should be. Let me start at the beginning.

The year was 1972. We were living in a small town in western Pennsylvania. There were three of us: Roger was 15 and Rory was 10. I was the middle child, and 13 years old at the time. Now that my brothers and I were older, we no longer needed a babysitter. Given the way we had always tormented babysitters in our youth, it had been a while since my parents had found anyone willing to watch us. And so when we were old enough to stay home without a babysitter, my parents started to go out on Saturday evenings. They had been doing it for several years when the shooting occurred.

“Geez Carole, would you hurry up!” Dad yelled up the stairs. “We are going to be late.” I didn’t need to look at the clock to know that it was exactly 8:17 p.m. It was Saturday night, and like every other Saturday night, Mom and Dad were heading out to see a movie after dinner. As I mentioned in the beginning, every week it was the same routine. We would finish dinner around 7:45 p.m. or so. Mom would then go up and start to get ready to go out with Dad. While Mom got ready, Dad took the family dog, Misty, for a walk around the neighborhood. It was always the highlight of Misty’s week. Misty loved my Dad.

Dad and Misty made it home from their walk by exactly 8:00 p.m. so that Dad could watch Archie Bunker in “All in the Family.” He walked in the door with Misty and jetted straight toward the family room to sit on his favorite chair. “All in the Family” was the one show that Dad watched religiously – nothing came between him and that show. What’s more is that Mom made an exception to the “no food in the family room” rule – she let us have our dessert in the living room during the show.

When the second set of commercials came on at 8:17 p.m., Dad would yell up to Mom to hurry up. They needed to leave right after the show ended at 8:30 p.m. in order to get to the movie theater, buy tickets and get seated for the 9:00 o’clock showing. After all these years, we could set our clock by their routine.

The night that Mom was shot, our parents were going to go see “The Poseidon Adventure.” Depending on how it was, Mom and Dad said they would take the three of us to see the movie that Sunday. Mom wanted to make sure that it wasn’t too scary. The movie was rated PG, but it was listed as an action thriller. Remember, Rory was only 10 years old at the time.

That night, while Dad was taking Misty for a walk, all three of us boys did the dinner dishes. Who did what was always up for grabs. Mom had divided the chore of doing the dishes into three sections, so that everyone could help. Dad decided to make a game of it by having everyone draw cards when it came to chores. That night, Rory had drawn the low card, so he had the task of taking all of the dinner plates to the sink and clearing off the table. Whenever Rory chose the low card, he would clean off the table and then immediately take off to play outside until we dragged him in for bed. Roger drew the middle card, which meant he had the task of bringing the dessert dishes in from the family room and washing them after “All in the Family.” I picked the high card, and as a result, I was in charge of putting the dinner dishes into the dishwasher and washing the pots and pans. I was also in charge of bringing everyone dessert in the family room, which hopefully would be before the start of the show. Tonight was not one of those nights though as the pots had taken a little longer and I walked in with dessert right after the opening rendition of “those were the days.”

At 8:28 p.m., Dad let out his final plea to Mom to hurry up. “Carole, would you please hurry!” As soon as “All in the Family” ended, Dad always gave that yell. As always, Mom answered, “I’ll be right down.” A minute or so later, Mom headed down the stairs.   Unlike normal weeks, the dishes from dessert were still in the family room, because Roger was on the phone with his girlfriend, Ginger. Much to Dad’s dismay, Mom was unable to just leave them there for Roger to do when he got off of the phone. Instead, she grabbed the dishes and took them into the kitchen to wash them. That was when it happened. As Mom turned on the faucet, a stream of water came out of the sprayer and shot her right in the face, ruining her makeup. Someone had placed tape on the sprayer so that when the water was turned on, instead of coming out of the faucet, the water would come shooting out the sprayer, soaking the person in front of the sink.

Fortunately, Mom really wanted to see the movie, and given the theme of the movie, she felt that the drowned rat look might be acceptable. No one ever got blamed for doing it. However, the answer is clear. … Who shot Mom?

Some people like certain riddles more than others, and adding descriptive tags to titles would help organize the subreddit more as well as inform users as to the type of riddle.
My ideas for riddle ""types"" (examples on the site I link to):

1. [Reasoning Riddles](http://www.bigriddles.com/reasoning-riddles) involve the use of clever thinking.
1. [Logic Riddles] (http://www.bigriddles.com/logic-riddles) often involve examining the situation and making judgements. ***EDIT: these types of riddles might belong in /r/puzzles.***
1. [Lateral Thinking Riddles] (http://www.bigriddles.com/lateral-thinking-riddles) involve thinking outside the box and questions can be posed in yes/no form about the riddle.
1. [Language Riddles] (http://www.bigriddles.com/language-riddles) are based in the use of language (i.e. what gets wetter as it driess?). Often rhyming.
1. [Spatial/Geometric Riddles] (http://www.bigriddles.com/spatial-riddles) involve the arrangement of or rearrangement of shapes or patterns.
1. [Meta] tags would signify posts about (the state of) the subreddit itself. Suggestions, mod posts, etc...
1. [Request] tags would signify, well, requests.

So, tags would be something along the lines of [Reasoning] [Logic] [Language] [Meta] etc...


Just a friendly suggestion!

1351564096.0,17,self.riddles,12beg9,The hardest logic puzzle I have ever heard.,mcawesomer,34,17,55,http://www.reddit.com/r/riddles/comments/12beg9/the_hardest_logic_puzzle_i_have_ever_heard/,"A group of people with assorted eye colors live on an island. They are all perfect logicians -- if a conclusion can be logically deduced, they will do it instantly. No one knows the color of their eyes. Every night at midnight, a ferry stops at the island. If anyone has figured out the color of their own eyes, they [must] leave the island that midnight. Everyone can see everyone else at all times and keeps a count of the number of people they see with each eye color (excluding themselves), but they cannot otherwise communicate. Everyone on the island knows all the rules in this paragraph.

On this island there are 100 blue-eyed people, 100 brown-eyed people, and the Guru (she happens to have green eyes). So any given blue-eyed person can see 100 people with brown eyes and 99 people with blue eyes (and one with green), but that does not tell him his own eye color; as far as he knows the totals could be 101 brown and 99 blue. Or 100 brown, 99 blue, and he could have red eyes.

The Guru is allowed to speak once (let's say at noon), on one day in all their endless years on the island. Standing before the islanders, she says the following:

""I can see someone who has blue eyes.""

Who leaves the island, and on what night?


There are no mirrors or reflecting surfaces, nothing dumb. It is not a trick question, and the answer is logical. It doesn't depend on tricky wording or anyone lying or guessing, and it doesn't involve people doing something silly like creating a sign language or doing genetics. The Guru is not making eye contact with anyone in particular; she's simply saying ""I count at least one blue-eyed person on this island who isn't me.""

And lastly, the answer is not ""no one leaves.""

I've done my best to make the wording as precise and unambiguious as possible (after working through the explanation with many people), but if you're confused about anything, please let me know. A word of warning: The answer is not simple. This is an exercise in serious logic, not a lateral thinking riddle.

Today I introduce to you hover-to-read comments! This means that comments are invisible by default, but they are revealed by hovering over the area where they'd be. They are designed to replace spoiler tags.

### Why?

Having spoiler tags works well in a subreddit like /r/games, where you'll occasionally need spoiler tags to hide the ending of a game, a plot twist, etc. However, in /r/riddles, nearly every single comment needs spoiler tags. This can be troublesome, especially for new users unfamiliar with them. So, why bother spoiler tagging each post individually, when you can spoiler tag it all?

This is where hover-to-read comments come in. They eliminate the need for spoiler tags by spoiler tagging everything.

### But I don't like it!

Don't worry, this is only a 2 week trial period. At the end, I will make another post asking for feedback, and depending on your responses, I will change back to spoiler tagging, or keep hover-to-read comments.

### The Trial Period

During the 2 week trial period, I would ask you to please **keep spoiler tagging your answers** with \[answer here](/sp). I have made it so that answers spoiler tagged in this way will appear the same as normal text (just to give a better idea of what the subreddit looks/feels like with out spoilers), but if we decide to go back to spoilers I'll make them work again.

### TL;DR

Hover over comments to view them, I'll make a post in 2 weeks asking if you like it or not, during this time please use spoiler tags in answers anyway.",,False,,t5_2qiux,False,,mod,True,t3_11ewrk,http://www.reddit.com/r/riddles/comments/11ewrk/announcement_hovertoread_comments/,moderator

You are in prison with 19 other inmates. The warden decides to let you free if you can solve this riddle.

You and the other 19 inmates are placed in a room before the game begins. You are told the rules and you have as much time as is needed to collaborate before you are all brought back to solitary confinement.

Rules:
- Every hour one random inmate will be brought into a room with 2 light switches in it.
- The inmate must change one and only one of the switches before he leaves the room.
- The game ends when any inmate can say with 100% certainty that every single inmate has flipped a switch.

Some clarifications:
There is absolutely no communication between the inmates or any other party after the initial planning.
When a random inmate is chosen it is truly a random selection, one inmate could be chosen 30 times in a row, or not chosen for a very long time.
The light switches go up and down and that's it, no tricks like that. This is pure reasoning.
The game ends when an inmate comes forward and if positive that everyone has flipped a switch at least once. He does not guess, even if it goes on for thousands of years.

Edit: Yes, the two light switches are next to each other. There is a left switch and a right switch. Both switches are down at the beginning.",,False,,t5_2qiux,1348343090.0,,,True,t3_10alep,http://www.reddit.com/r/riddles/comments/10alep/light_switches_in_prison/,

None of those post titles tell you anything about the riddle.

It's been found. I'm pissed about it. They needed two cops to move a brick to get it out, which broke the brick. They've posted twice NOT to destroy anything, and that it's in plain sight. [Example one](http://puu.sh/3rY2t.png) [Example two](http://puu.sh/3rY4L.png). It's in the rules too. It was in Wargo Court.

[Here are some people's comments on the ""Medallion found"" post.](http://puu.sh/3rYHm.png)


Clue #1: It's time to get this thing going in full swing. But a bag of clubs do not bring. There's no par for this course, so playing here may cause remorse. This clue is a trap, so keep going and don't look back.

Clue #2: You may think it takes *hart* to solve these clues, but a cunning mind might broaden your views. So don't let 25 break your strive.

Clue #3: &lt;cityname&gt; is great at helping her sister out, but that's not what this hunt is all about.

Clue #4: I'm not on the edge of insanity. I'm not trying to shake you to your core. I just can't give you no *moor*.

Clue #5: My hiding spot has trees and a bench or two. There are no castles in my view. So to be just and fair, I'm in a place that's in &lt;citynames&gt; care.

CLUE #6: My pleas cannot be heard above the ringing of bells.
Where the medallion is at, I will not tell.

Clue #7: I'm here to state my case and send you in an about face. So I'm taking away the Keyes just to put your mind at ease.

Clue #8: To win this prize, you must first all rise. Straying west of University, will lead to your demise.

Clue #9: The jury's back and the judge is in place. A glimmer of gold just might save my case. I won't make the Jamboree, unless you come set me free.

Clue #10: The verdict is in..... My backs against the wall. It's holding me steady maybe I won't fall. Don't lose track or I just might, slip through the cracks.

Clue #11: If you can't stand it anymore, than maybe you should kneel. It's plain to see once you are on both knees.

They'll put out another clue tomorrow morning, so I'll update the post with that if nobody has found it. When I find out where it is I'll post with a general idea of it, to avoid giving out personal information.

Also, no climbing/digging is required, and it's hidden within the city. We've searched a couple parks and haven't found it, but it can be hidden in any public place.

There aren't any golf courses in the city. 

Okay, as someone has already posted the city name in the comments, I'll post it as well, in case you don't read that. It's Columbia Heights, MN.

Thanks!

A bit of an update: I'm fairly sure I know where it is, or at least the area. I have a feeling it's by Hart Lake. Across the street from Hart Lake is a place with Lighthouse in the name. Lighthouse = Boat = Moor. Plus the area is similar to a Moor. It also appears that there are 25 houses around the lake.

Update 2: Nope, not there. :\ There's a new clue though, I added it up there.

Yet another update: At Prestemon Park, there's a sign that says ""No golfing allowed."" which would make hint #1 make sense.

Update 4: Maybe it's at Ramsdell? Curtis Ramsdell was shot with a .25. It also has a picture of his *face* there.. I've heard it's hidden at Huset often, but didn't find it when I checked. The only place I haven't checked is McKenna, and they have a Basketball *court*. McKenna's also on 7th street, which could also explain 25. It could also be at Wargo *court*, I checked there quite a bit though.

Update 5: They sneakily eliminated Kordiak, I believe. I haven't checked there either, but it's maintained by Anoka, not Heights. So the ""Within Heights care"" is probably about that.

Update 6: Maybe a lot of these are red herrings? It says in clue 6 ""Where the *medallion* is at, I will not tell."", however, a lot of the rest talk about where the *person* is..

Investigators could tell me that Mrs. Hansen always tend to have the door to her bedroom locked when she is there.

And the killer has probably knocked on the door to get to her.
What has happened is that the killer has stabbed Mrs. Hansen in the chest as soon as she opened the door, but she didn't die immediately.

However, she has managed to close the door and lock it, so the killer never came into the room.
Then she tried to crawl towards the end of the room where she has bed and a desk standing side by side.

Probably to try to give a message about who killed her.


But she has failed to come up to the desk where she has pen and paper lying and instead collapsed and fell dead about halfway up in her bed with her right hand lying on a blue and yellow gift paper.
Police think the fact that, she was about to wrap gifts when the killer knocked.

All witness statements indicate that there were only four people in addition to Mrs. Hansen in the house when the murder occurred, and that the killer must therefore be among them.

- It was the South American maid Ana Lucia who has worked for several years for Mrs. Hansen. She was the first who realized that something was wrong when Mrs. Hansen did not answer when she knocked on the door with lunch.

- Dr. Christer Green is Mrs. Hansen's personal physician and the rumors say that they had a relationship. The doctor said he was upstairs in the bedroom ten minutes after Ana Lucia too give Mrs. Hansen her daily medication. She did not open when he knocked on as he assumed that she was busy.

- Ivar Hansen is deceased Mr. Hansen's son and Mrs. his stepson. He watched TV in his room when Ana Lucia shouted at him. Together with Dr. Green, he broke into the room to Mrs. Hansen when they realized that something was wrong. Ivar then called the police while the doctor examined Mrs Hansen.

- Eivind Steina is a friend of Ivar and was visiting. He said he did not know Mrs. Hansen, and he also sat on the toilet with constipation while all this happened.
Investigators believe none of the four have particularly good alibis and that it is difficult to know who has done it.

It's from a video game: Silent Hill 3 if you set puzzle difficulty to hard and is a little infamous (you may have heard of it if you read Cracked.com) because most puzzles in the game are logical puzzles but this one requires knowledge of Shakespeare which left a lot of people stuck and it's very early in the game.

You are trapped in a bookshop. The door to escape takes a four digit code. You find a five part anthology of Shakespeare's plays:

1. Romeo and Juliet
2. King Lear
3. Macbeth
4. Hamlet
5. Othello

And a note scribbled on the wall near the door has a poem:

-------------
&gt;In here is a tragedy---

&gt;art thou player or audience?

&gt;Be as it may, the end doth remain:

&gt;all go on only toward death.

-------------

&gt;The first word at thy left hand:

&gt;a false lunacy, a madly dancing man.

&gt;Hearing unhearable words, drawn

&gt;to a beloved's grave---and there,

&gt;mayhap, true madness at last.

----------------


&gt; As did this one playing at death, 

&gt;find true death at last.

&gt;Killing a nameless lover, she 

&gt;pierced a heart rent by sorrow.

--------------------

&gt;Doth lie invite truth?

&gt;Doth verity but wear the mask of falsehood?

&gt;Ah, thou pitiful, thou miserable ones.

----------------

&gt;Still amidst lies, though the end cometh 

&gt;not, wherefore yearn for death?

&gt;Will thou attend thy beloved? Truths 

&gt;and lies, life and death:

&gt;a game of turning white to black and 

&gt;black to white.

---------------

&gt;Is not a silence brimming with love more

&gt;precious than flattery?

&gt;A peaceful slumber preferred to a throne 

&gt;besmirched with blood?

-----------------------

&gt;One vengeful man spilled blood for two;

&gt;Two youths shed tears for three;

&gt;Three witches disappeared thusly;

&gt;And only the four keys remain. 

-------------------------

&gt;Ah but verily...

&gt;In here lies a tragedy.

&gt;Art thou player or audience?

&gt;there is something which cannot become 

&gt;a puppet of fate or an onlooker,

&gt;peering into a cage.

One day there was a French King named King Louis the XIth 
He was a strong believer of the “supernatural” and particularly loved “astrology” (reading the stars)
He kept a renowned astronomer close to him and frequently asked him what destiny lay awaited the monarch

One day the astronomer reads that the queen shall die in 10days time
and as predicted 10days later, the queen dies

The king is now upset and unsettled.
Did the astronomer murder the queen to ensure his readings came true
Or does the astronomer truly possess incomprehensible supernatural ability?

Regardless of the reasons, the king could not afford to keep the astronomer alive
The king summons the astronomer and tells his soldiers
“when I give the signal, pick up the man and throw the bastard out that window!”

The astronomer arrives at the castle
Before the king gives the signal, he asks one question
He was curious whether this astronomer truly possessed supernatural powers

“What destiny awaits you, astronomer?”

The astronomer answers…. “xxxxxx”
The astronomer is forever pampered and looked after for the rest of his life.

What did the astronomer say to the king?

Challenge: make the equations true.


rules:

1. don't add letters or numbers (so no squaring or cubing)

2. no use of ""is not equal to"" or ""is somewhat equal to""

3. No rounding

Basically, use different characters [(+, -, *, /) although those aren't all of them] to make each equation true. 2 is already completed. I did all of them except for 8 and 10.

  For the execution of 100 prisoners, the king/devil/executioner lets them play a game for their lives. He tells them the following:
""Tomorrow, I'm going to sit you all down in a circle, and give you either a red or blue hat at random. You will not be able to see your own hat, or communicate at all, but can see the hat everyone else is wearing. Now, once you all get your hat, I'm going to ask you to all simultaneously guess your hat color, or not guess. Now, here's the catch- I will kill all of you if anyone guess incorrectly OR nobody guesses. In order for all of you to live, everybody who guesses, must guess correctly, and at least one person must guess. You have one night to plan.""

So, how can the prisoners conspire to have the highest likelihood of surviving?

The chief of the tribe decrees that tomorrow morning, the survivors will be made to stand in a single-file line, tallest person in the back and shortest person in the front. Each prisoner will be given, at random, a white or black hat. No prisoner will be able to see his or her own hat. The executions will start at the back of the line and move up one by one, and each prisoner will get a chance to guess what color hat he or she has on. A right answer will mean life and a wrong answer will mean death by gunshot. During this, any talking or other forms of communication amongst the prisoners will result in the immediate death of everyone. Each prisoner must stand still, face forward, and the only word that can be uttered at all is ""white"" or ""black"" when it's his/her turn to guess.

During the night, the prisoners gather to come up with a strategy. What's their best plan for survival?

Clarifications/hints:

1. Again, once the hats are assigned, there is absolutely no form of ""secret"" communication between any of the prisoners at any time.

2. A minor clarification for the mathematically inclined: when I said that the hats are assigned randomly, it doesn't actually mean statistical randomness. For example, having 10 black hats in a row doesn't affect the probability of black hats coming up in the future. The cannibals could technically give everyone black hats if they wanted to.

3. There is a 50% chance that everyone survives.

V2Blast and I (the mods) had a conversation over PMs, but we can't decide whether we should take away links or not, so we're asking the community to decide.

I'm all for self-posts only, as anything that's a riddle can be posted, easily, in self-post form. For example, from the current front page: 

http://redd.it/s2e2v

http://redd.it/s0k9u

http://redd.it/rs5vs

http://redd.it/r5ogf

http://redd.it/qs40a (you may argue it's an exception, but it could still be done as a self post)

None of these links couldn't be done in the form of self posts.

Also, external websites may be blocked at workplaces, whereas a self post, with the exact same contents, wouldn't be.

Self posts are more convenient to reply to with a solution; there's no clicking back and forth between sites, as the comment box is right below the riddle.

If people are interested, we could do a sort of ""test-run"", where we disabled links for, say, 2 weeks, and, depending on feedback, either continued or stopped with self-post only mode.

Anyway, enough from me. What do you guys think?

He summoned his alchemist, who was rumored to have the recipe to the strongest poison, and his cook. He told them that they had one week to concoct their strongest poison.

At the end of that week, they would reconvene and have a contest. Each person would drink the other person's poison, and then their own. If their poison was strongest, they would live, and the king would keep that poison. The cook knew that he would never be able to make a poison stronger than the alchemist's, so he came up with a clever plan.

The maid told him that she had hidden it for safekeeping under a green book that was on the desk. But when they looked the bill was not there. The butler said he had found the bill where the maid had left it. He had placed it inside the book, where he thought there was less chance that somebody would find it. He had written down the page numbers so that he would not forget them. The bill was between pages 35 and 36, he said. But when they looked, there was no money in the book.

_________________________________________________________

A King has a Prisoner shackled down in his court, waiting to be executed. Before the ceremony can take place, a mysterious man walks into the chamber demanding a chance to speak. He has riddle for the King.

The Man says to the King, ""If you can solve this riddle in one attempt you can kill me and the prisoner, if you can't, we both go free.""

The King, interested, and famous for his wit, accepts the challenge. The Man then says, ""The answer to this riddle, is how I am related to the Prisoner!""

The Man continues. ""Brothers and Sisters I have none, but this man's Father is my Father's son."" 

He concludes. ""How am I related to the Prisoner?""

What is the answer to the riddle?
_________________________________________________________

""this man"" in the riddle's text is referring obviously to the Prisoner, I'd say ""this prisoner"" for clarity but it doesn't sound as good.

Give yourself one try to comment the answer.

This may not be as difficult when the text of the Riddle is on screen, as it is spoken in real life.

Seeing a shooting star, he decided to make a wish. Unknown to him, this would change his life forever.

James wished that whatever he would say or think would become true. A good example of this would be him thinking ""If only it were snowing"", and suddenly it would snow.

Just a few days later, he was sitting in Geometry class wondering if the test he was about to take would be too hard for him. When he got the test, he was proven right, and he wished that he were smart enough to ace the test. Suddenly, it became very clear to him and he answered all the questions with 100% accuracy. Receiving his test back with an A+, he was amazed that it actually worked. Upsetting his best friend Aaron, who only got a C- on the test, which caused a fight between the two of them.

A few days later, James got into a fight with a different kid that he didn't like. He wished to himself that this kid were terminally ill. The next day he came into class and the kid wasn't there. He asked his teacher about it and she said that he had suddenly come down with an illness that she couldn't disclose, and that there was a very slim chance of him making it.

Sure enough, the next day, the boy had passed away. Feeling immense guilt, James sorrowfully attended the boy's funeral.

At home the next night, alone, James was watching TV upstairs in his room. Suddenly, the phone rang. Thinking that it might be his parents, he ran downstairs to answer it. Upon picking it up, all he heard was a dial tone. He thought to himself ""that's strange..."", and returned to watching TV. Just then, the doorbell rang. Thinking it was Aaron, come to make up with him from their fight, he prepared to tell him his secret. He rushed back downstairs to the door, opened it and said ""Hey Aaron, I...""

There is a room with 100 identical wooden boxes in it, numbered in order from 1 to 100. Inside each box is the name of a prisoner, with each name appearing only once. The order of the names is random.

The prisoners are put together in holding cell where they can come up with a plan. One by one, each prisoner is allowed to go into the room and is given exactly 20 minutes in the room to open 50 boxes of his choice. He then must leave the room in exactly the same state as he found it (with the boxes closed) and go to another area. It is impossible for any information to be communicated back to any other prisoner. The goal is that each prisoner must find his own name. If even one prisoner fails to find his name, they are all executed at dawn.

So the questions is, what is the best strategy?

Now what?

*Now, let' have some fun...*

---

He gathers the smurfs to list the rules of his little game.

Every smurf will be put in line, so that a smurf can see the color of every hat of the ones before him in the line. The first one cant see anything, and the last one can see all hats but his.

Then, Gargamel gives to every victim a hat. It can be black or white. All of them can be black, all of them can be white, half/half...

Then, starting from the last in the line, he asks what color he thinks his hat is. Everyone hears the color he gives. Once he speaks, he is taken to another room where he is either given to Azrael, his cat, for food if he fails, or kept alive if he succeeds. The ones still line line cannot hear if he dies or succeeds.

The smurfs can of course set up a strategy beforehand, but cannot communicate during the game other than by saying a color.

How many smurfs can be saved at most without involving luck, and how? (Say there is 100 smurfs)

Number of smurfs that can be saved :

[99](/sp)

(Note that this spoiler does not contain the answer, don't hesitate to check it if you're stuck.)

If you've solved this riddle, i will give you another one, much harder. I've been on this one for 5 years, and i have yet to find the answer.

The first one to give the answer to this second riddle will win 2 (two) month of gold.

I'm sorry if i have made any mistake, English isn't my mother tongue.

Have fun !

----

Edit : Now that someone has found the right answer, i will put the second part of this riddle. Note that i do not know the answer, so the advices that i give may be useless.

Gargamel is upset. He got tricked. This time, they will lose.

They are put in a circle. A smurf can see every other hat, but not his. The hats have a number from 0 to 99 (if there is 100 smurfs). They can all be numbered 0, all 1, half 4 half 59, one of each...

They will all say a number altogether. If the number said is the one on the hat he lives. If not... 

Of course, they can set up a strategy. They can agree on every one having a different comportment (to me this cant be done without it), or not.

How can they save at last one smurf ?

You both take out your wallets, and put all your bills and coins on the table in front of you. To make things fair, before the game begins you decide on a number and both put in the middle that many bills/coins. (i.e. if you decide on 5, you both put in 5 bills/coins for a total of 10). At this point, you arrange the money on the table in the shape of a line. Now that the table is set, the rules to the game are very simple. Each player will take turns taking a bill/coin from either end of the line. Once all the bills/coins have been taken, each player will count his total and whoever has grabbed the most cash will win! You are chosen to go first; what stratagy can you employ to ensure you always win or tie, but never lose?  
*To Clarify* The stratagy is for dealing with the bills/coins once they are set in a line.

Notes  
*Once you decide on the number of bills and coins to use, you will always end up with double that number in the line.  
*Any value bills and coins could be used, from 1 cent, to 100 dollers.  
*The money is arranged in the line randomly.  
*You must always take money from either the begining or end of the line, not from the middle.

*edit* Here is a hint...

If you get super frustrated and just want to know the answer, you can probably find it in my past posts.

1. Out of every game I play, no other makes me stay.  
I'd ditch them all to go back to you.  
Computer space has no stars. A circle and two bars.  
How I wish it was '72.  

2. Before a man or before a sun  
Before before a ten, now before one two!  
And I'm not exactly sure 'bout one,  
But always after, and never before a two.  

3. I use linux because it's free,  
and a programmer I shall strive to be!  
Input this command to list, you see  
the files in current directory.  

4. I krafted a grilled cheese of one.  
Stuck another in a stripper's bum.  
Mr. Carter, wanted to make one honest,  
so he went and put a ring on it.  

5. Three borders are of interests ulterior  
With ones up and down my either side  
Two added together fill my interior  
Shape matters not; results are bonafide! 

6. Voler voler voler voler  
Was all the Chinese man could say  
When into a Mick Dees he strayed  
voler mouche mouche voler  

7. An abbrevation often used  
When speaking of this international location  
Economists, financers and bankers choose  
to invertir en estas sub-equatorial nations  

8. A archipelago without sex  
Half Of whom's population I possess  
Originally controlled by the dansk  
Along with brothers John and ""Cross""  

9. Pumpkin and Apple, all know pie!  
But I remain hidden in obscurity  
Why do people forget about me? Why oh why!  
When Leonhard made me so eazy  

10. Fields of iron, burning red,  
Two angled cameras atop my head.  
Over tiny mountain piques I roam  
Hoping one day to go home.  

11. U.S. standard is one-oh-one, though  
most people will use three more  
When defecting to Newton's foe  
seventy-eight replaces one-oh-four  

12. Changing a state of oxidation,  
reacting in chemical elation.  
Or igniting flavor concentration,  
via dihydrogen monoxide evaporation.  
Take-aways: a math simplification.  

13. Used to shorten nails or hair,  
A common name their team shares.  
Or vehicle to transport man,  
He rode and discovered land!  

14. Fredrick or Beth can both be regarded,  
Johnny and Roger can't be discarded.  
A ruler, a knave, one-ten I acquire;  
You're the only one I desire.

Yet despite their efforts, his best officer told the following story:

""Chief, the diamonds have been stolen. There were three suspects in the building that we were keeping a special eye on, when all of a sudden a car engine screams and an unregistered vehicle storms out onto the street. We got every policeman in the building to chase it, but when we finally found it it was abandoned. Inside was the bag the diamonds were kept in--but no diamonds. We also realized that, since we'd left, any one of the three suspects could have stolen the diamonds.""

""This looks bad,"" the chief murmured. ""Who are the three suspects?""

""One is Chris Kalfas, who used to steal from safes but hasn't in a while. The second suspect is Travis Hawkes; he's also a pretty good thief, but he's superstitious, so he won't act unless his mentor, Chris, is involved. The final guy is Aaron Jacobs. He's blind, so his hearing is so good he is able to hear every click of the safe. He's the best safe thief ever."" 

The chief thought for a moment.

""I know who was definitely involved,"" he announced finally. ""Let's go interview him and see if he'll tell us if he had a partner or not.""

Maybe you guys can help me with something which has bothered me for a long long time. :)

So about 15 years or so in school I had this great teacher. Problem was, I was not the keenest on doing my homework and ""forgot"" it quite often. This teacher would regularly pull me out of class afterwards and ""oversee"" my homework, telling me to do them anyways or sometimes even punishing me with getting me to do the homework twice.. Well, this one day I didnt have my homework.. again. 

Actually, it was the homework and the punishment from the day before which I both didnt have ready. So my teacher comes up to me and tells me that I have two choices. I can either do the homework 4 times until tomorrow, or I can solve a riddle for him and he will waver the homework.. I obvioulsy went for the riddle:

""So I was having a stroll the other day through the forest. I walked a few miles in, when suddenly I came upon this group of highway men; without loosing a breath they overwhelmed me and tied me up. Then they started to interrogate me. As it turns out, they were concerned that I was a spy or a gendarme, aiming to bring them to justice. 

It was obvious to me that if I'd deny this allegation, they'd see me for the civilian I really was and would kill me. If I told them however, that I really was a spy they'd be afraid of me and kill me anyways.

Well, obviously I am still alive.. So what did I say to them to get out of this situation?""

Well, I didnt get the answer right away (I tried a few things, but I dont remember what) so we agreed that I would give him the answer the very next day. Unfortunately, that teacher developed severe health concern at the same evening - and I never got a chance to ask him for the answer.

Does anyone know more about this riddle than I do?",,False,,t5_2qiux,False,,,True,t3_l2p5q,http://www.reddit.com/r/riddles/comments/l2p5q/help_with_this_riddle/,

Long ago, there was a man imprisoned for treason. The king was kind, and decided to give the man one last chance before execution. He would be given two bowls, and 100 marbles--50 white, and 50 black. He could then divide the marbles between the two bowls in any way he liked, as long as all 100 marbles were used. When he was finished, he would be blindfolded, and be given one of the two bowls at random. He would then pick a marble from that bowl. If it was black, he would be executed. If it was white, he would be set free. If you were the prisoner, how would you arrange the marbles in order to ensure the highest probability of being set free? (There is no way to guarantee survival, but get as close as possible.)

2. A similar situation is at hand. A prisoner is offered a game of chance in order to be set free or executed. This time there are two marbles in a jar, one white and one black. He will pick one blindfolded, and if he picks white he gets to go free. However, this time, the mean king actually put two black marbles in the jar.

A jousting knight is at a gatehouse, trying to enter a castle to stay for the night. Unforunately, the King has set a law, for security reasons, that no object any longer than four meters may pass through the gates. As such, the guard on duty informs the knight that he may not enter the castle with his five meter lance.

Unwilling to part with his lucky lance which has won him many tournaments, he turns around, and heads to the nearest carpenter. An hour later, he returns to the gatehouse, and he is let through without question.

I posted it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/oshcd/hey_reddit_whats_your_favorite_riddle/) yesterday and nobody could come up with the answer.  I heard about /r/riddles and I thought that maybe you guys would be able to help me out.  Here's the ridddle:

*There was once a village of 50 very smart and very crazy scientists. Each day these mad scientists studied advanced calculus and biomedical research and plotted devious evils upon the world. Realizing that the scientists must be stopped, a neighboring town of wise men sent their leader to place a curse on the scientists. The curse was: On each scientist’s back was placed a bomb, either white or black, and any scientist who discovered the color of his own bomb would explode that day at midnight. Unknown to the scientists, the leader of the wise men placed 10 black bombs and 40 white bombs. Of course, the scientists thought they could outsmart this curse. They removed all mirrors and reflective objects from the village and vowed never to tell another scientist the color of his bomb – for they saw each other every day and each could see the color of everyone’s bomb except their own. Five years passed and the scientists believed they had outsmarted the wise men. There had been no explosions and life progressed as usual. Then came a turning point. The leader of the wise men returned to the village and called for all the scientists to gather around him. Thinking that he might remove the curse, each of the 50 mad scientists listened carefully to what the wise man had to say. And it was this: “I will tell no one the color of his own bomb, but I will tell you all this. There is at least one black bomb.” And then he left the village. Thinking nothing of the incident, the mad scientists continued their evil plots. Then, some number of days later, they exploded. Why?*

EDIT: I didn't know if I needed to include this when I originally posted this, but here is a thought-provoking question from [the source of the joke](http://mrferrante.com/MadScientists.html) that might be helpful:

*It seems paradoxical that the scientists blew up since they already knew there was at least one black bomb. After all, the scientists with black bombs saw 9 other black bombs each day and the 40 scientists with white bombs saw 10 black bombs each day. Yet if the wise man never calls them to the meeting, no one will ever explode! Why does it make a difference when the wise man tells them something they seem to already know? Better yet, what does he indirectly tell them that they didn’t know before?*

The two big questions I have are

1. What does the wise man tell the scientists indirectly and 

2. Why does it take them a ""number of days"" to explode?  What did they figure out after the wise man talked to them that they didn't know the first day he talked to them (the first day being the day he told them there was at least one black bomb)?",,False,,t5_2qiux,True,,,True,t3_otaly,http://www.reddit.com/r/riddles/comments/otaly/the_mad_scientists/,

Three people are in the desert. They are named A, B and C for convenience.

A dislikes C, and decides to murder him, so he poisons C's water supply (this being the desert, C will have to drink from this or die from thirst) 

B, completely seperate and unknowing of A's actions also decides to murder C. He does this by removing C's water supply, so that he would die of thirst

C dies later due to lack of water

I'm sure I can adapt some riddles on here to be pirate-y, but I would love any help thrown my way. Keep in mind that the riddles are for kids ages 8-17. The groups will be of mixed ages. I try to keep them fairly balanced.

Riddle #2: I kill men but make some live. The stars would be brighter without me.

Riddle #3: People are out for me, so I keep to my chambers, when I'm not being driven.

Riddle #4: I'm not naturally found in the way you think of me. The band misspelled my name and I'll see you at the movies.

Riddle #5: Without me you couldn't hear. Without it it be to cold for life, but yet if I become to strong citys will fall.

Riddle #6: I'm sought by hunters. I march in lines. I made the walls fall down.

Riddle #7: I tell you when to stop, family plans track me, you could be looking at me right now.

Riddle #8: Some style me everyday, but when I'm scared I stand at attention. Those who are challenged have gone as far as to plug me in.

Riddle #9: The Pitfall used me to get across. I use others to grow tall. The fruit of this.

Riddle #10: Perhaps you've grown tired of these but sometimes you have to answer in them. A symbol ends it but can also be defined as it.

Mark's dad won't buy himself a new car. 10 years of sacrifice, all thrown in the trash in 15 seconds. Mark jumped out the window. He didn't survive.

**Why did Mark kill himself?**

---

Remember, you can only ask yes/no or a/b/c/d questions in order to figure out what happened. Ask away!

Hope you guys like it!

---

**SOLUTION**

[Mark's dad has been saving up to buy a new car for over a decade. When he finally got enough to be able to buy the car, Mark came up with a plan to make some money on the side without his dad noticing. He took the money and put it on a betting site.](/sp)

[He was looking for a game with low odds, one that would be relatively safe to bet on while giving him about 10% of return. As this was taking place in 2009, he found a live bet of a handball World Cup game between Poland and Norway. With 50 seconds to go, Norway was leading the game 30:29. The odds for Norway victory or draw (X2) were about 1.1, making this a perfect bet for Mark, since it was close to impossible for Poland to score two goals in less than a minute.](/sp)

[Well, as the video below shows (I'm posting the link below because the reddit spoiler thingy doesn't allow you to copy or click on links), it wasn't that impossible. After an incredible turn of events, Polish goalkeeper Szmal saved what would otherwise have been the winning goal for Norway, the winger Gliński scored the equaliser. Norway needed a win to advance into the semifinals, so they subbed their goalie out and brought in a 7th court player. With less than 10 seconds to go Norway loses the ball and Poland pivot Artur Siódmiak throws it into the empty net from about 50 meters.](/sp)

[Poland wins the game 31:30, Mark loses his bet. He realises he just threw away his dad's savings of a decade. He's unable to handle the guilt. He jumps out of the window and dies.](/sp)

The tribe is composed of an African king and his citizens. Because of their strict religion, the villagers uphold four rules.  The first rule is that no person is allowed to leave or enter the village at all times. 


The second rule is that, all the male members of the tribe must either cut their own hair, or let their king cut their hair once their hair is too long. 


The third rule is that all female members of the village can not marry if they are still virgins, unless they let their king cut their hair.

The last rule is that, all the members of the village must not be naturally bald (or must have their hair grow back once it is cut)

If you break any of the rules, the punishment will automatically be death.

Now two men have been caught entering the village, a woman was caught trying to escape the village, and a man was found out to be naturally bald. At the end of the day though, five people were killed, and because of that, chaos and disarray ruled the village. Why were there five people killed instead of four?



Edit:
Okay guys, so it seems a bit hard since no one has solved it yet, but I'll give you a clue. Actually, there already IS a clue. You just have to find it. A clue on the clue, what you don't understand, will ultimately show you the answer :p

Since 5 people were killed instead of 4, there's one other person who has violated at least one of the rules. Think, who is that person and what did that person violate?

On your way you find a bus stop with 4 people who desperately need any transportation to drop them to their desired destination. The problem is, the next bus scheduled to pass by will be in the morning. You stop your car &amp; meet the 4 persons:

- A pregnant woman who started to have excruciating pain &amp; looks like she's on the verge of giving birth. She's pleading to be sent to any hospital or at least being helped while going into labor.

- A young child crying &amp; screaming because he/she wandered away from his/her parents &amp; home. The child doesn't know where his/her address is, but knows the full name of his/her parents. He/she just wants to go back to his/her parents/home.

- A surgeon doctor with his briefcase that contains his medical tools. He needs to go to his hospital as soon as possible in order to perform a very critical surgery.

- The 4th person is someone who just wants to go home, but it happens that you already have known &amp; met this person before. To you, that person is a very dear &amp; close friend/love of your life/desired future spouse. It's been a very long time since you both seen each other. You've always wanted to meet this person again to reconnect &amp; rebuild your relationship with him/her, and you can't find a better opportunity to do that, because if you don't take do it, chances are that you may not have that opportunity again.

Now keep in mind that the only helpful tool you can use for the 4 people is your sports car, which has only 1 empty passenger seat for only 1 person and doesn't have a trunk. There are no cell phones or anything else to be used to help them. There's no one else on the road to help them but you. The bus stop is located away from any public facilities (hospitals, police stations,...) and houses, so no one can take it for a walk, especially in this kind of time &amp; weather.

What do you do in that kind of situation? How will you give your help &amp; prioritize it to those people? Which one will you choose to be the first person to be helped? You have to think very quickly to come up with a solution for this predicament.

1.) he beats everybody
2.) if he does get beaten, he has beaten a person that has beaten that person (confusing i know but say we have three players A,B,C and A beats C and B beats A but C beats B then A is still a winner)

Is there always a winner given that there are n players? Also please explain. (Btw its very possible that there can be more than 1 winner, the question is ""is there always atleast one"")

Congrats to El_Chinko69 and exbreder!  The problem is still open to alternative proofs/solutions though!

Can you combine two numbers - a constant `C` and zero - in to an expression that has the following properties?

  *  The solution equals a number that is not `C` or negative `C`  It doesn't need to work in such a way that the solution *never* equals C or negative C, but just in such a way that there are several values of C that would work.
  *  The solution is different for different values of `C`  
  *  You cannot change `C` or 0 into different values before you combine them with eachother, nor can you change them to a different value after you combine them (e.g.: you couldn't do ""`C` + cosine(0)""  because it changes zero before it's combined with C, you also couldn't do ""√(`C` + 0)"" because you're changing the numbers after you combine them).  It must be the combination of these two numbers itself which yields the new number.
